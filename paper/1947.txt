The Welfare Cost of Uncertain Tax Policy

ABSTRACT

Frequent shifts in tax policy can increase uncertainty about future

net-of-tax wages and interest income. This paper measures the impact of
uncertain tax policy on savings, labor supply, and welfare in the United

States. A vector autoregression model with six variables was estimated
which found the standard error of the one-year-ahead forecast for the wage
tax to be 1.8 percentage points, and for the interest income tax 3.3

percentage points. Furthermore, the negative correlation between
unanticipated shifts in the real interest rate and changes in the interest
income tax amplifies the variability in the real after-tax return.
A two-period model of consumption and labor supply is developed that
measures the effect of uncertain taxes on savings, work hours, and taxpayer

welfare. Using plausible empirical parameters, it is shown that removing
all uncertainty about future tax policy can lead to a welfare gain of 0.4
percent of national income, or about 12 billion dollars in 1985.

I. Introduction

Traditional studies that measure the excess burden of taxation assume
that tax rates are certain and unchanging, at least until the government

decides to change them. However, recent experience in the United States has
emphasized that taxpayers are justified in treating taxes as another

unpredictable factor in an uncertain world. For example, following the
passage of the Economic Recovery Act of 1981, a number of provisions, such
as the controversial rule allowing the trading of corporate tax credits,

immediately came under attack. The threat of repeal discouraged many firms.
from taking advantage of the tax cuts; the chairman of one corporation, able
to sell benefits for less than half their estimated value, attributed the
low price to the "risk of losing the tax benefits through a change in the

tax law or other contingencies." (Clark, 1981). Currently, few agree on the
final outcome of the President's tax reform efforts, leading to considerable
uncertainty about the future marginal tax rate (which may range between 27
and 38 percent under Senate and House proposals), as well as the tax
treatment of specific investment classes.
The potential dangers of uncertain taxes have been recognized since

Adam Smith, who observed that "The certainty of what each individual ought
to pay is, in taxation, a matter of so great importance, that a very
considerable degree of inequality, .

1Quoted in Clark (1983).

. . is not near so great an evil as a very

2

small degree of uncertainty." (Smith, 1976; II: 351)2 This view suggests
that the proper role for the government is to reduce uncertainty about

future tax rates. However, there are two reasons why unexpected variations
in tax rates may increase, rather than decrease, economic welfare. First,
if the income fluctuation is positively correlated with the tax rate, the
variance of net-of-tax income may be reduced, thereby benefitting the

risk-averse taxpayer. In a progressive tax system, for example, a rise in
income is partially offset by a rise in tax rates, while a fall in income is

cushioned by a decline in tax rates. The second reason was suggested by
Stiglitz (1982) and Weiss (1976), who argued that random taxation can

increase social welfare in the presence of existing taxes. The idea is that
the tax uncertainty can cause consumers to work more and save more, thereby
increasing revenues and partly offsetting the distortion caused by the
initial labor and capital income taxation.3

This paper measures the uncertain component of wage and interest income

taxes during the period 1929-75. Marginal tax rates calculated by Joines
(1981) are used in a vector autoregression (VAR) model

which includes

government expenditure and debt, interest rates, and earnings. The

2Smith's concern was that the uncertainty of taxation "encourages the
insolence and favors the corruption" of the tax collection agents.
Currently, those who write the code, rather than those who collect
taxes, might be more subject to lobbying efforts. See also the 1982
Economic Report of the President, p.111.
3Even if labor supply and savings increases, the consumer may still be
worse off owing to the additional uncertainty introduced by the random
taxes. The result depends on the strong convexity of the marginal
utility function and a weak degree of risk aversion. Also see Chang
and Wildasin (1985).

3

estimated coefficients indicate that the one-year-ahead forecast error of
the wage tax is 1.8 percentage points, and for the capital income tax 3.3

percent. While unexpected shifts in the wage rate are positively correlated
with the wage tax, unexpected shifts in the interest income tax are

negatively correlated with the interest rate. One reason for this negative
correlation is that unexpected jumps in inflation rates tend to both
decrease real ex post interest rates and increase the real tax on interest

income. The interest income tax therefore accentuates interest rate
uncertainty. Using empirical parameters in a two period model, the annual
cost of uncertain taxes is estimated to be 0.4 percent of national income,

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
discusses recent studies of tax uncertainty and presents a simple generalequilibrium model of consumer, government, and production sectors which
jointly determine labor supply, savings, taxes, government expenditures, and

debt. In Section III, a VAR corresponding to the reduced form of this model
is estimated. Section IV provides a numerically computable model of
individual consumption and labor supply decisions solved subject to the VAR
estimates, while Section V concludes.

II. A Simple Model of Uncertain Tax Policy
There has been recent interest in the implications of uncertain or

unpredictable tax policy. Judd (1984) focused on how the timing of future
tax increases affects current labor supply and consumption in a general

4mis result is not a test of the Stiglitz-weiss hypothesis, which may
hold for some (e.g., interternporally nonseparable) utility functions.

4

equilibrium model. He found that for plausible parameters, increased
uncertainty about when a future capital income tax would occur led to rising

current labor supply and savings. Auerbach and Hines (1986) emphasized the
dramatic variations in investment tax incentives during the postwar period,
leading to effective tax rates for myopic investors ranging from -19 percent

in 1982 to 61 percent in 1953. They compared optimal investment patterns of
individuals with myopic expectations and those with perfect foresight in a
model which included adjustment costs.

Most recently, Kaplow (1986 a,b) has argued that the government should

not compensate taxpayers for unexpected changes in tax rates. Government
compensation introduces moral hazard; firms need not avoid investing in
activities which the government later wishes to discourage through taxation.
Private insurance companies are thought to be the proper institution for
spreading risk.

In the model below, individual taxpayers form rational expectations

about future taxes, wages, and interest rates. Unlike Kaplow's analysis, it
is assumed that the unexpected tax shifts may not be justified on efficiency
grounds, but often reflect unexpected inflation, expenditures, or policy

vacilations. The general equilibrium model of wage, interest income,
taxation, saving, and labor supply is based on three sectors. The first
comprises consumers, who make labor supply and savings choices contingent on

expectations about future net-of-tax wage and interest rates. The second is
the production sector, which relates the supply of labor and capital to

gross-of-tax wage rates and interest rates. Third, the government sector
simultaneously determines expenditure, debt, and marginal tax rates

5

necessary to collect tax revenue. The model is used primarly to establish
the structure of expectations that rational consumers use to predict future
net wage and interest rates.
Utility depends on current and future leisure and consumption,

U U(C,) + E(U(C2,2)}
where C. and

(1)

represent consumption and leisure, respectively, and E is

the expectations operator conditional on information at period 1. The
timing of the model is that individuals choose labor supply at the outset of

the period. At the end of the period, wages and interest rates are
realized, taxes are paid, and the consumption decision is made. Labor
supply decisions are determined before the net wage is realized to reflect
human capital investments and occupational choices made early in the life

cycle which affect subsequent work effort.5 Although there is no specific
bequest function, C2 can be thought of as combining second period

consumption and any bequests or assets retained for a later period.6 The

5Alternatively, labor supply could be chosen after the wage is

marginal tradeoff between C2 and £2.
6For example, utility U(2,B2) can be maximized subject to C2 =

or assets passed to the next period. Holding the relative price of
bequests and consumption constant, the indirect utility function
corresponding to U would be V(C2) which could then be substituted

The progressive nature of the U.S. tax system leads to a divergence

between the average and the marginal rates. Although the actual tax code is
complex and non-linear, it can be approximated as a negative income tax,

with a guaranteed lump-sum subsidy during the two periods of p > 0 and

marginal tax rates t. on wage and r. on interest income. The present value

of V are that governments will always prefer to spend more, holding debt and
taxes constant (BV./ag. > 0) and will always be worse off for a given level
of spending with higher marginal tax rates or debt (3V/8x < 0, x

approximately by the squared value of the marginal distortion, Barro (1979)
has suggested that the optimal solution of the government is to set constant
marginal rates over time, and use debt to cushion unexpected expenditures

(e.g., during wartime). The formulation presented here, however, suggests a
greater degree of variation in taxes and expenditures, as shifts in savings
and labor supply affect the "price" of expenditures, and as a new
administration leads to a potentially different objective function V1.

From equations (1) and (4), current labor supply and savings decisions
depend on the expected value and the distribution of future net wages and

interest rates. We therefore presume that individuals making these choices
in period i-i use the information set available at that time to forecast

future net wage and interest rates in period i. Consider first the general
equilibrium solution to the vector of factor prices written as
=

(w.,r.}'.

Factor prices will depend on the capital-labor ratio, and

hence on total debt and on labor supply and savings chosen using information

from the previous period. Thus P. can be expressed as a function of
concurrent government policy, lagged labor supply and savings decisions
(which in turn depended on lagged values of P and taxes) and an error term.

The two-period formulation has often been used to characterize

"working" and "retirement" stages of the life cycle. In this model, the
second period need not correspond to retirement; the essential feature of
the prediction problem faced by consumers, however, is that they must make
current savings (and human capital) decisions which will subsequently be

affected by tax policy for a number of years in the future. Since consumers
are making decisions about future consumption and labor supply over a number
of years, their goal is to predict average taxes and factor prices (and the

variance of those averages) over the future time horizon. In particular, it
is assumed that the representative future horizon corresponds to consumption
and labor supply at ages 50-59 planned from the perspective of age 35. The
forecast relevant to the 35-year old is not simply the value (and variance)

of a tax rate in some future year, but the average tax over the entire

lO-year period.10 The next step is to show how the VAR model using annual

A VAR Model of Expenditure, Debt. Income, and Taxes

The estimation of equation (9) uses yearly U.S. data between 1929 and

1975 in real 1972 dollars. The measure of privately held government debt is
from Barro (1979), while combined federal and state government expenditures

are calculated from the National Income and Product Accounts. Owing to
difficulty in measuring wages since 1929, earnings are estimated in the VAR
model and subsequently converted to wage rates for the numerical

calculations. Earnings are likely to vary more than wage rates if hours of
work are positively correlated with wages. However, average earnings will
also understate the risk of unemployment. Earnings are defined as the ratio
of employee compensation to total non-agricultural employees, while real ex
post interest rates are defined as the Moody Aaa bond rate minus the change
in the GNP deflator (Economic Report of the President, 1985).

Joines (1981) calculated effective marginal tax rates on capital income

and labor income during 1929-75. The labor income tax is the marginal tax

12

on labor income, weighted by the share of labor income in each marginal

bracket. Taxes on labor income are defined as state and local
(proportional) taxes plus federal wage, salary and social security taxes,

plus taxes on miscellaneous income (which is included as earned income).13
Capital income includes interest and dividend income plus taxable capital
gains,14 while the capital income tax is comprised of state and local
proportional taxes, corporate, dividend, interest, and other unearned income
taxation.

There are two ways to measure marginal tax rates. The first takes an
average of the statutory marginal rates, weighted by taxable income (Barro

and Sahasakul, 1983a,b; Estrella and Fuhrer, 1983). This paper uses the
second measure of marginal taxes (Joines, 1981; Seater, 1985) which
calculates the actual (weighted) change in tax payments as income grows.

*

That is, the marginal tax is defined as (T-T )/(Y-Y ), where T and T* are
*

actual

*
taxes paid, and Y and Y adjusted gross income, in adjacent

brackets

15

13Miscellaneous income was partnership income plus business income
plus farm income. Assuming that miscellaneous income was attributed
to capital income generally made less than 1 percentage point
difference in the tax rate (Joines, 1981).

alternative definition of income excluding capital gains leads to
only slightly different tax rates. There might have been greater
variability in tax rates if the "inflation premium" for interest and
dividend income had been excluded from the tax base.
15The second measure used in this paper accounts for available
deductions and exemptions that tend to rise for higher income
taxpayers, and would tend to make the consumer's effective marginal
rate less than the statutory rate. It may understate the true
marginal rate, since the tax preferred goods will be less highly
valued at the margin. See Barro and Sahasakul (1983a) and Seater
(1985).

13

Estimates of the VAR model are presented in Table 1. These
coefficients should be interpreted cautiously since they measure the reduced

form of the structural model. The coefficient of lagged expenditures on
current debt, 0.992 (t-statistic of 6.20), and the insignificance of lagged
debt on wage taxes or interest income taxes lends support to Barro's (1979)

hypothesis that governments meet shifts in expenditures primarly by issuing

debt rather than raising taxes. However, the negative and significant
effect of lagged debt on current expenditures also suggests that increasing

levels of debt tends to reduce expenditures. Additional lagged variables
were not generally significant.16
The correlation coefficients for the contemporaneous residuals are also
presented in Table 1.

The interpretation of the covariance structure is

more relevant to the study of how uncertain taxes interact with other

factors. For example, the positive correlation (0.457) between earnings and
wage taxes means that an unexpected drop in earnings (or holding hours per
worker constant, wages) will lead to a lower than expected wage tax. Thus
the worker is partially "insured" by the knowledge that net wages will not

drop by the full proportional amount of the gross wage decrease. The
negative covariance between the interest income tax and real interest rates
leads to even more uncertainty in the net-of-tax rate of return;
unexpectedly low gross interest rates are associated with high taxes, and

conversely. This negative correlation may be caused by unexpected

16The only exception was the interest rate regression, in which the
dependent variable lagged 2 years was strongly significant. To
preserve computational simplicity, however, a first-order lag
structure was assumed for the entire VAR model.

14

inflation, which tends to reduce ex-post real interest rates and increase

effective tax rates. The standard error of the one-year forecast is 1.8
percent for the wage tax and 3.3 percent for the interest income tax.

The Joines data stop at 1975, so that measures of effective tax rates

from King and Fullerton (1985) are used for 1980. Weighted effective tax
rates for capital income including insurance companies and non-profit

institutions were 37.2 percent, and the tax on labor income plus the measure
of social security taxes (Barro and Sahasakul, 1983) yields 37.1 percent.
The 1980 average wage and interest rates were $5.02 and 2.7 percent,

respectively. The coefficents of W used to predict F are presented in Table
2, along with the initial (1980) variables and the predictions. Assuming
stationarity of the model, the optimal prediction is that earnings will rise
from $10,040 to $12,160 in real terms, the government will erase its debt,

the wage tax will fall to 31.7 percent (3.5 percent standard error) and the
interest income tax will rise to 44.2 percent (4.4 percent standard error).

Correlation coefficients of , the variance-covariance matrix of F, are
also presented in Table 2. In the long run, there is virtually no
correlation between the error terms for gross wages and capital income

taxes. The positive covariance between earnings and wage taxes (0.932) and
the negative covariance between interest taxes and the interest rate

(-0.744) become more pronounced in the 20 year forecasts. The next step is
to measure how this uncertainty affects consumer's consumption, labor
supply, and utility.

IV. A Model of Consumption and Labor Supply

The utility function in equation (1) is specified as
EU =

((a +

+ E((l+5)(a + C)))/7

(13)

where & is the time preference rate, and a is a parameter reflecting the
relative tradeoff between leisure and consumption in a particular year. The
leisure-consumption elasticity of substitution is
l/(l--y)

is

a =

l/(l-p),

while

the elasticity of substitution between household "output" in year

1 and in year 2.17
Using the budget constraint from equation (4), the first order

conditions for C1 and 2 can be shown to be

17This utility function assumes that the intertemporal elasticity of
substitution (a) is equal to the inverse of the Arrow-Pratt relative

risk aversion measure. They need not be; a nionotonic transformation
of EU could imply different values of the (inverse) Arrow Pratt
measure and the elasticity of substitution (Hall, 1985).
18

In general, l is predetermined, since it was chosen at time 0.
Assuming that it is freely chosen, as is done here, will tend to
understate the true welfare cost of tax uncertainty.

16

Equations (14a) and (14b) are highly non-linear, and can be solved

using numerical methods. Note that the consumption and labor supply
decisions depend only on wages, the interest rate r2 (which is the annual
interest rate accumulated over the n-year period), and taxes, but not on

government expenditures and debt. Writing wages as earnings divided by 1830
hours (see below), denoting the LHS of (14a) as Mc and the UIS of (l4b) as
and assuming normal error terms, the first order conditions take the

is the truncated density function of normally distributed

random variables with mean F and variance-covariance matrix given by the

corresponding 4x4 submatrix of 2 (Johnson and Kotz, 1972; p. 40). The
limits of integration given by a. prevent explosive solutions (e.g., if r2 <
-1) and reduce computational costs.

The parameters of the utility function were chosen to be consistent
with life cycle consumption and labor choices for a representative
individual between ages 30 and 40 making decisions about labor supply and

consumption for ages 50-60. The Consumer Expenditure Survey of 1972-73 was
used to measure household consumption and work hours for both the 30-39 year

olds and the 50-59 year olds. Average consumption for the 30-39 year old
families was $9400, while gross-of-tax earnings were $12,400 and assets
(which includes the market value of the house) were $19,000, or the

potential for consuming an additional $1900 per year over the 10 year

period. Using information from the Survey on actual taxes paid, "virtual"

17

income given the linear marginal tax rates was calculated to be $6500.
Labor supply was assigned by multiplying the number of weeks worked during

the past year times 40 hours (if a full time worker), 20 hours (if part

time) or 0 hours (if reported not working). Average hours for the 30-39
year old were approximately 1830 yearly hours, while 50-59 year olds worked
an average 1680 hours.
There is substantial evidence about the value of -y.

Friend and Blume

(1975) in their study of financial portfolio decisions suggested that

was

less than 0.5, while Ghez and Becker (1975) placed on a an upper bound of
0.28. Skinner (1985) found estimates between 0.25 and 0.5, although Hansen
and Singleton (1983) and Weber (1970,1975) found values generally exceeding
0.5.

I assume that

0.35, although the model is tested for higher and

lower elasticities.

The evidence on the uncompensated labor supply elasticity in static

models suggests an average elasticity of approximately 0.3.19 The link
between the elasticity of substitution

and the conventional labor supply

elasticitiy is complex, since changes in the wage rate will also have an

impact on the dynamic path of labor supply. If we assume that the wage
change is foreseen, it can be shown the implied a corresponding to the 0.3

labor supply response will be approximately 0520 The time preference rate

From Killingsworth (1983; pp. 119-124), men's labor supply appears
to be at most 0, while for women it is at least 1.0 (although there is
considerable variability in coefficient estimates across studies).
Weighting the two elasticities by labor force participation yields an
average of 0.4. However, other studies of aggregate labor supply
(Killingsworth, 1983; p. 125) report elasticities primarly less than
0.2; thus a midpoint of 0.3 is adopted.

S was chosen to replicate the observed level of consumption in the first
period ($9400), total time endowment 0 was set to 4000 hours, and the
leisure preference parameter a was adjusted to insure 1830 hours were spent
working in the first period.21
Comparing a regime with taxes that have a random component and taxes
that can be forecast with compelete certainty is problematic, since
switching to certain taxes will have general equilibrium effects on the

distribution of gross wage and interest rates. However, we can pose the
following conceptual experiment -

- what

are the effects of certain taxes on

an individual given the variance-covariance structure of gross wage and

interest rates? That is, under the status quo of uncertain taxation,
consumption and labor supply are chosen which satisfy (14a) and (14b)
integrated over uncertain w2, r2, t2, r2. This outcome is compared to

certain taxation, in which savings and labor supply are chosen subject to

(14a) and (l4b) integrated over uncertain w and r, holding t2 and
constant (i.e., perfectly foreseeable) at their mean values. The government
can expect to raise equal revenue in both cases.

O The labor supply parameter can be transformed into a by solving for
-8/8w(w/(O-) in the certainty model; the general solution for
n-period models of this sort can be found in NBER Working Paper 819,
an early version of Auerbach, Kotlikoff, and Skinner (1983).
21The distribution of uncertain wages, interest rates, and taxes was
truncated by a rectangle 2.5 standard deviations above and below the
mean for all four variables, encompassing 96.3 percent of the normal
distribution. The mean value of the gross interest rate used in the
simulation, r' , was adjusted to ensure that its expected value
E((1±r')19) was equal to the perfect certainty interest rate (LO)'

19

The first row of Table 3 presents the results of the model for the

baseline parameters of

and a. When certain taxes are imposed, hours of

work rise by 0.1 percent in the first period, and fall by 1.8 percent in the

second period. The explanation for these changes is that the certain tax
regime reduces the variance in net interest rates. Thus providing for C2 is
more easily achieved by saving in the first period, rather than working
extra hours in the second period; overall savings rises by a total of 0.8
percent.

The utility gain of certain tax policy is expressed as a proportion of

the present value of lifetime income. As Stiglitz (1982) and Weiss (1976)
have emphasized, increased revenue from uncertain taxes can potentially
raise sufficient revenue to offset the loss in utility of risk averse

consumers. Thus the welfare change is measured as the dollar value of the
shift in ex ante utility plus the revenue gain (or loss) from certain

taxation. Column 6 indicates that for the parameters a = 0.35 and

= 0.50,
the welfare gain of certain tax rates is 0.4 percent of lifetime
income. Conversely, the annual loss of uncertain taxation, expressed as a
proportion of 1985 U.s. national income, is $12 billion.

This finding is not particularly sensitive to alternative

specifications of the utility function. Rows 2-5 present results from the
numerically computable model for different values of crc and a. Row 2 uses
an intertenporal elasticity of 1.35; while savings and labor supply is more
responsive to the more certain tax policy, the welfare gain is only 0.2

percent. A high intertemporal elasticity of substitution is also equivalent

20

to a low degree of risk aversion in this model; hence the reduction in

income variation is less valuable. When the labor elasticity is set to 1.5
(row 3) the results differ slightly from the baseline case in row 1; there

is a 0.4 percent welfare gain from certain taxation. The benefits of
certain taxation are 0.5 percent of income when a =

0.15, reflecting the

greater degree of risk aversion, while when the labor supply elasticity is

0.15, the efficiency gain of certain taxation is 0.8 percent. The doubling
of the welfare gain reflects the modest substitutability between
predetermined £2 and random C2.

Finally, the 6th row describes the welfare

gain of uncertain taxes when virtual income is increased from $6500 to

$8500. Because the consumer saves a larger fraction of income, and hence is
subject to greater uncertainty from the interest income tax, the gain of

certainty in tax policy rises from 0.4 percent to 0.6 percent. This
calculation provides support for the notion that the interest income tax,

both because of its greater variability, and its negative correlation with
real interest rates, causes the greatest harm to risk-averse taxpayers.

One extension of this model would be to introduce government

expenditures explicitly into the utility function. The assumption of the
current model is that expenditures enter utility independently of private
consumption goods. However, if government expenditures (e.g. , medicare,

housing, social security) substitute for private expenditures, then
taxpayers would be partially compensated for expenditure increases
associated with tax hikes. If government expenditures did substitute for
private goods, then the welfare cost of uncertain tax policy would be
reduced.

21

V. Conclusion

The traditional analysis of uncertainty and taxation focused on the

beneficial effects of a certain tax on the return from a risky asset

(Stiglitz, 1969; Eaton and Rosen, 1980; Kanbur, 1983) The government, by
collecting a fixed proportion of the return, or subsidizing a fixed

proportion of the loss, shares the risk of the investment. This paper has
shown that tax rates in the United States have displayed considerable

variability during the period 1929-1975, thereby eroding the potential

benefits of taxes in reducing risk. The additional excess burden of
uncertain rather than certain tax policy is estimated to be 0.4 percent of

GNP, or $12 billion in 1985. The random components of the wage and its tax
rate are positively correlated, but the random components of the real
interest rate and its tax rate are

negatively correlated, suggesting that

capital income taxation increases the variability of net interest rates.
Uncertain tax policy may also be harmful if "permanent" tax cuts are
perceived by taxpayers as random and unlikely to persist in the future.
Although the perceived temporary tax cuts may stimulate short-run
investment, the loss in revenue may not be compensated for by an increase in
long-term investment (Skinner, 1984).

Tax policy is often unpredictable because of factors beyond the control

of the government. However, the cost of extensive tinkering with the tax
code should be recognized. Furthermore, the value of tax provisions that
are flexible to future economic conditions, such as the indexing of capital

22

gains to inflation, are substantial in an uncertain environment. Neither
the government nor the taxpayer gain from tax codes which must constantly be
adjusted in light of differing rates of inflation or economic activity.
While taxes may be inevitable, they need not be as unpredictable.
