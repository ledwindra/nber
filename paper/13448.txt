No-Arbitrage Taylor Rules

NBER Working Paper No. 13448
September 2007
JEL No. E43,E44,E52,G12
ABSTRACT
We estimate Taylor (1993) rules and identify monetary policy shocks using no-arbitrage pricing techniques.
Long-term interest rates are risk-adjusted expected values of future short rates and thus provide strong
over-identifying restrictions about the policy rule used by the Federal Reserve. The no-arbitrage framework
also accommodates backward-looking and forward-looking Taylor rules. We find that inflation and
output gap account for over half of the variation of time-varying excess bond returns and most of the
movements in the term spread. Taylor rules estimated with no-arbitrage restrictions differ from Taylor
rules estimated by OLS, and the resulting monetary policy shocks are somewhat less volatile than
their OLS counterparts.

Introduction

Most central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), conduct monetary policy to only
influence the short end of the yield curve. However, the entire yield curve responds to the
actions of the Fed because long-term interest rates are conditional expected values of future
short rates, after adjusting for risk premia. These risk-adjusted expectations of long yields are
formed based on a view of how the Fed conducts monetary policy. Thus, the whole yield curve
reflects the monetary actions of the Fed, so the entire term structure of interest rates can be
used to estimate monetary policy rules and extract estimates of monetary policy shocks.
According to the Taylor (1993) rule, the Fed sets the short-term interest rate by reacting to
CPI inflation and the output gap. To exploit the cross-equation restrictions on yield movements
implied by the assumption of no arbitrage, we place the Taylor rule into a term structure model.
The no-arbitrage assumption is reasonable in a world of large investment banks and active
hedge funds, who take positions eliminating arbitrage opportunities arising in bond prices that
are inconsistent with each other in either the cross-section or their expected movements over
time. Moreover, the absence of arbitrage is a necessary condition for an equilibrium in most
macroeconomic models. Imposing no arbitrage, therefore, can be viewed as a useful first step
towards a fully specified general equilibrium model.
We describe expectations of future short rates by versions of the Taylor rule and a Vector
Autoregression (VAR) for macroeconomic variables. Following the approach taken in many
papers in macro (see, for example, Fuhrer and Moore, 1995), we could infer the values of long
yields from these expectations by imposing the Expectations Hypothesis (EH). However, there
is strong empirical evidence against the EH (see, for example, Campbell and Shiller, 1991;
Cochrane and Piazzesi, 2005, among many others). Term structure models can account for
deviations from the EH by explicitly incorporating time-varying risk premia (see, for example,
Dai and Singleton, 2002) .
We present a setup that embeds Taylor rules in an affine term structure model with timevarying risk premia. The structure accommodates standard Taylor rules, backward-looking
Taylor rules that allow multiple lags of inflation and output gap to influence the actions of the
Fed (for example, Eichenbaum and Evans, 1995; Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans, 1996),
and forward-looking Taylor rules where the Fed responds to anticipated inflation and output
gap (Clarida, Galı́ and Gertler, 2000). The framework also accommodates monetary policy
shocks that are serially correlated but uncorrelated with macro factors. The model specifies
standard VAR dynamics for the macro indicators, inflation and output gap, together with an
1

additional latent factor that drives interest rates. This latent factor captures other movements in
yields that may be correlated with inflation and output gap, including monetary policy shocks.
Our framework also allows risk premia to depend on the state of the macroeconomy.
By combining no-arbitrage pricing with the Fed’s policy rule, we extract information from
the entire term structure about monetary policy, and vice versa, use our knowledge about
monetary policy to model the term structure of interest rates. The model allows us to efficiently
measure how different yields respond to systematic changes in monetary policy, and how they
respond to unsystematic policy shocks. Interestingly, the model implies that a large amount of
interest rate volatility is explained by systematic changes in policy that can be traced back to
movements in macro variables. For example, 74% of the variance of the 1-quarter yield and
66% of the variance of the 5-year yield can be attributed to movements in inflation and the
output gap. Over 78% of the variance of the 5-year term spread is due to time-varying output
gap and output gap risk. The estimated model also captures the counter-cyclical properties of
time-varying expected excess returns on bonds.
We estimate Taylor rules following the large macro literature that uses low frequencies (we
use quarterly data) at which the output gap and inflation are reported. Under the cross-equation
restrictions for yields implied by the no-arbitrage model, we estimate a flexible specification
for the macro and latent factors. This setup offers a natural solution to the usual identification
problem in VAR dynamics that contain financial data, such as bond yields (for example, Evans
and Marshall 1998, 2001; Piazzesi 2005). The Fed’s endogenous policy reactions are described
by the Taylor rule as movements in the short rate which can be traced to movements in the
macro variables that enter the rule: inflation and output. While the Fed may take current yield
data into account, it does so only because current yields contain information about future values
of these macro variables.
Our paper is related to a growing literature on linking the dynamics of the term structure
with macro factors. However, the other papers in this literature are less interested in estimating
various Taylor rules, rather than embedding a particular form of a Taylor rule, sometimes
pre-estimated, in a macroeconomic model. For example, Bekaert, Cho, and Moreno (2003),
Gallmeyer, Hollifield, and Zin (2005), Rudebusch and Wu (2005), and Hördahl, Tristani,
and Vestin (2006) estimate structural models with interest rates and macro variables. In
contrast to these studies, we do not impose any structural restrictions other than the absence
of arbitrage. This makes our approach more closely related to the identified VAR literature in
macroeconomics (for a survey, see Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans, 1999) and this provides
us additional flexibility in matching the dynamics of the term structure. Other non-structural
2

term structure models with macro factors, like Ang and Piazzesi (2003), and Dewachter and
Lyrio (2006), among many others, also do not investigate how no-arbitrage restrictions can
help estimate different policy rules.
We do not claim that no-arbitrage techniques are superior to estimating monetary policy
rules using structural models. Rather, we believe that estimating policy rules using no-arbitrage
restrictions are a useful addition to existing methods. Our framework enables the entire
cross-section and time-series of yields to be modeled and provides a unifying framework to
jointly estimate standard, backward-, and forward-looking Taylor rules in a single, consistent
framework. Indeed, we show that many formulations of policy rules imply term structure
dynamics that are observationally equivalent. Naturally, our methodology can be used in more
structural approaches that effectively constrain the factor dynamics and risk premia.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the model and develops
the methodology showing how Taylor rules can be identified with no-arbitrage conditions. We
briefly discuss the estimation strategy in Section 3. In Section 4, we lay out the empirical
results. After describing the parameter estimates, we attribute the time-variation of yields and
expected excess holding period returns of long-term bonds to economic sources. We describe in
detail the implied Taylor rule estimates from the model and contrast them with OLS estimates.
Section 5 concludes.

The Model

We describe the setup of the model in Section 2.1. Section 2.2 derives closed-form solutions
for bond prices (yields) and expected returns. In Sections 2.3 to 2.8, we explain how various
Taylor rules can be identified in the no-arbitrage model.

2.1

General Set-up

Our state variables are the output gap at quarter t, gt ; the continuously compounded year-onyear inflation rate from quarter t − 4 to t, πt ; and a latent term structure state variable, ftu . We
measure year-on-year inflation using the GDP deflator. Our system uses four lags of the output
gap and year-on-year inflation variables but parsimoniously captures the dynamics of the latent
factor with only one lag. This specification is flexible enough to match the autocorrelogram of
year-on-year inflation and the output gap at a quarterly frequency. We assume that in the full
3

state vector, Xt−1 , potentially up to four lags of the output gap and inflation Granger-cause gt
u
and πt, but only the first lag of the variables, gt−1 , πt−1 , ft−1
, Granger-cause the latent factor ftu .

Below we show that this assumption is not restrictive (for example, in the sense of matching
impulse responses.) Thus, we can write the dynamics of the state variables as:

latent factor, and
vt =

For ease of notation, we collect the four lags of all the state variables in a vector of K = 12
elements:

Xt = gt πt ftu . . . gt−3 πt−3 ft−3



and write the VAR in equation (1) in companion form as:

Σ=

09×3 09×9

and μ and Φ collect the appropriate conditional means and autocorrelation matrices of the VAR
in equation (1), respectively.
We use only one latent state variable because this is the most parsimonious set-up with
Taylor rule residuals (as the next section makes clear). This latent factor, ftu , is a standard
latent factor in the tradition of the term-structure literature. Our focus is to show how this
factor is related to monetary policy and how the no-arbitrage restrictions can identify various
policy rules.
We specify the short rate equation to be:
rt = δ0 + δ1 Xt ,

4

(3)

for δ0 a scalar and δ1 a K × 1 vector. To keep the model tractable, our baseline system has only
contemporaneous values of gt , πt and ftu and no lags of these factors determining rt , so only
the first three elements of δ1 are non-zero.
To complete the model, we specify the pricing kernel to take the standard form:




mt+1 = exp −rt − λt λt − λt εt+1 ,

(4)

with the prices of risk:
λt = λ0 + λ1 Xt ,

(5)

for the K × 1 vector λ0 and the K × K matrix λ1 . To keep the number of parameters down, we
only allow the rows of λt that correspond to current variables to differ from zero. We specify


λ̄0
λ0 =

09×1
where λ̄0 is a 3 × 1 vector. Likewise, we specify that the time-varying components of the prices
of risk λ1 , depends on current and past values of macro variables, but only the contemporaneous


value of the latent factor: [gt πt ftu gt−1 πt−1 gt−2 πt−2 gt−3 πt−3] . That is, we can write:


λ1 =

09×12
u

where λ̄1 is a 3 × 12 matrix with zero columns corresponding to ft−1

The pricing kernel determines the prices of zero-coupon bonds in the economy from the
recursive relation:
(n)

Pt

where Pt

(n−1)

(6)

is the price of a zero-coupon bond of maturity n quarters at time t. Equivalently,

we can solve the price of a zero-coupon bond as:

where EQ
t denotes the expectation under the risk-neutral probability measure, under which
the dynamics of the state vector Xt are characterized by the risk-neutral constant and
autocorrelation matrix:
μQ = μ − Σλ0
ΦQ = Φ − Σλ1 .
If investors are risk-neutral, λ0 = 0 and λ1 = 0, and no risk adjustment is necessary.

Bond Prices and Expected Returns

The model (2)-(5) belongs to the Duffie and Kan (1996) affine class of term structure models,
but incorporates both latent and observable macro factors. The model implies that bond yields
take the form:
(n)

= a n + b
n Xt ,

yt
(n)

where yt

(7)

is the yield on an n-period zero coupon bond at time t that is implied by the model,
(n)

which satisfies Pt

(n)

= exp(−nyt ).

The scalar an and the K × 1 vector bn are given by an = −An /n and bn = −Bn /n, where
An and Bn satisfy the recursive relations:
1
An+1 = An + Bn (μ − Σλ0 ) + Bn ΣΣ Bn − δ0
2

Bn+1
= Bn (Φ − Σλ1 ) − δ1 ,

(8)

where A1 = −δ0 and B1 = −δ1. The recursions (8) are derived by Ang and Piazzesi (2003).
(1)

In terms of notation, the one-period yield yt is the same as the short rate rt in equation (3).
Since yields take an affine form and the conditional mean of the state vector is affine,
expected holding period returns on bonds are also affine in Xt . We define the one-period
excess holding period return as:

(n)
rxt+1

= log
(n)

= nyt

(n−1)

Pt+1

(n)

Pt


− rt
(n−1)

− (n − 1)yt+1

− rt .

(9)

The conditional expected excess holding period return can be computed using:
1 
(n)


ΣΣ Bn−1 + Bn−1
Σλ0 + Bn−1
Σλ1 Xt
Et [rxt+1] = − Bn−1

(10)



ΣΣ Bn−1 + Bn−1
Σλ0 and
which again takes an affine form for the scalar Axn = − 12 Bn−1

the K × 1 vector Bnx = λ1 Σ Bn−1 . From equation (10), we can see directly that the expected
excess return comprises three terms: (i) a Jensen’s inequality term, (ii) a constant risk premium,
and (iii) a time-varying risk premium. The time variation is governed by the parameters in
the matrix λ1 . Since both bond yields and the expected holding period returns of bonds are
affine functions of Xt , we can easily compute variance decompositions following standard
VAR methods.

2.3

The Benchmark Taylor Rule

The Taylor (1993) rule describes the Fed as adjusting short-term interest rates in response to
movements in inflation and real activity. The rule is consistent with a monetary authority that
minimizes a quadratic loss function that tries to stabilize inflation and output around a longrun inflation target and the natural output rate (see, for example, Svensson 1997). Following
Taylor’s original specification, we define the benchmark Taylor rule to be:
P,T
rt = γ0 + γ1,g gt + γ1,π πt + εM
,
t

(11)

where the short rate is set by the Federal Reserve in response to current output and inflation.
The basic Taylor rule (11) can be interpreted as the short rate equation (3) in a standard affine
P,T
corresponds to a
term structure model, where the unobserved monetary policy shock εM
t
P,T
latent term structure factor, εM
= γ1,u ftu . This corresponds to the short rate equation (3) in
t

which has zeros for all coefficients on lagged g and π.
The Taylor rule (11) can be estimated consistently using OLS under the assumption that
P,T
εM
,
t

or ftu , is contemporaneously uncorrelated with the output gap and inflation. This

assumption is satisfied if the output gap and inflation only react slowly to policy shocks.
However, there are several advantages to estimating the policy coefficients, γ1,g and γ1,π , and
P,T
extracting the monetary policy shock, εM
, using no-arbitrage restrictions rather than simply
t

running OLS on equation (11). First, no-arbitrage restrictions can free up the contemporaneous
correlation between the macro and latent factors. Second, even if the macro and latent
factors are conditionally uncorrelated, OLS is consistent but not efficient. By imposing
no arbitrage, we use cross-equation restrictions that produce more efficient estimates by
exploiting information contained in the whole term structure in the estimation of the Taylor
rule coefficients, while OLS only uses data on the short rate. Third, the term structure model
provides estimates of the effect of a policy or macro shock on any segment of the yield
curve, which an OLS estimation of equation (11) cannot provide. Finally, our term structure
model allows us to trace the predictability of risk premia in bond yields to macroeconomic or
monetary policy sources.
7

The Taylor rule in equation (11) does not depend on the past level of the short rate.
Therefore, OLS regressions typically find that the implied series of monetary policy shocks
P,T
from the benchmark Taylor rule, εM
, is highly persistent (see, for example, Rudebusch
t

and Svensson, 1999). The statistical reason for this finding is that the short rate is highly
autocorrelated, and its movements are not well explained by the right-hand side variables
in equation (11). This causes the implied shock to inherit the dynamics of the level of the
persistent short rate. In affine term structure models, this finding is reflected by the properties
P,T
corresponds to δ1,u ftu , which is the scaled
of the implied latent variables. In particular, εM
t

latent term structure variable. For example, Ang and Piazzesi (2003) show that the first latent
factor implied by an affine model with both latent factors and observable macro factors closely
corresponds to the traditional first, highly persistent, latent factor in term structure models with
only unobservable factors. This latent variable also corresponds closely to the first principal
component of yields, or the average level of the yield curve, which is highly autocorrelated.

2.4

Backward-Looking Taylor Rules

Eichenbaum and Evans (1995), Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (1996), Clarida, Galı́ and
Gertler (1998), among others, consider modified Taylor rules that include current as well as
lagged values of macro variables and the previous short rate:
P,B
rt = γ0 + γ1,g gt + γ1,π πt + γ2,g gt−1 + γ2,π πt−1 + γ2,r rt−1 + εM
,
t

(12)

P,B
is the implied monetary policy shock from the backward-looking Taylor rule. This
where εM
t

formulation has the statistical advantage that we compute monetary policy shocks recognizing
that the short rate is a highly persistent process. The economic mechanism behind such a
backward-looking rule may be that the objective of the central bank is to smooth interest rates
(see Goodfriend, 1991).
In the setting of our model, we can modify the short rate equation (3) to take the same
form as equation (12). Using the notation fto and ftu to refer to the observable macro and latent
factors, respectively, we can rewrite the short rate dynamics (3) as:
 o
ft + δ1,u ftu ,
rt = δ0 + δ1,o

where

⎛

δ1,o

⎞

⎟
⎜
⎟.
δ1 ≡ ⎜
δ
1,u
⎠
⎝
09×1
8

(13)

Using equation (1), we can substitute for ftu in equation (13) to obtain:
M P,B
 o
  o
ft + (δ1,u Φ
,
rt = (1 − Φ22)δ0 + δ1,uμ2 + δ1,o
21 − δ1,oΦ22 ) ft−1 + Φ22 rt−1 + εt

(14)

where we substitute for the dynamics of ftu and define the backward-looking monetary policy
P,B
shock to be εM
≡ δ1,u vtu . Equation (14) expresses the short rate as a function of current
t
o
and lagged macro factors, fto and ft−1
, the lagged short rate, rt−1 , and a monetary policy shock
P,B
εM
. Equating the coefficients in equations (12) and (14) allows us to identify the structural
t

coefficients as:


γ0 = (1 − Φ22 )δ0 + δ1,uμ2


γ1,g


γ2,g



21 − δ1,oΦ22 )

γ2,π
γ2,r = Φ22.

(15)

Interestingly, the response to contemporaneous output gap and inflation captured by the δ1,o
coefficient on fto in the backward-looking Taylor rule (14) is identical to the response in the
benchmark Taylor rule (11), because the δ1,o coefficient is unchanged. The intuition behind
this result is that the short rate equation (3) describes the response of the short rate to current
macro factors. The latent factor, however, contains a predictable component that depends on
past values of the short rate and the macro factors. The backward-looking Taylor rule makes
this dependence explicit. Importantly, the backward-looking Taylor rule in equation (14) and
the benchmark Taylor rule (11) lead to observationally equivalent reduced-form dynamics for
interest rates and macro variables.
P,B
The implied monetary policy shocks from the backward-looking Taylor rule, εM
, are
t
P,T
. In the no-arbitrage model, the
potentially very different from the benchmark shocks, εM
t
P,B
backward-looking monetary policy shock εM
is identified as the scaled shock to the latent
t

term structure factor, δ1,uvtu . In the set-up of the factor dynamics in equation (1), the vtu
P,T
shocks are IID. In comparison, the shocks in the standard Taylor rule (11), εM
are highly
t

autocorrelated. Note that the coefficients on lagged macro variables in the extended Taylor

rule (14) are equal to zero only if δ1,u Φ
21 = δ1,oΦ22 . Under this restriction, the combined

movements of the past macro factors must exactly offset the movements in the lagged term
structure latent factor so that the short rate is affected only by unpredictable shocks.
Once our model is estimated, we can easily back out the implied extended Taylor rule (12)
from the estimated coefficients. This is done by using the implied dynamics of ftu in the factor

o

vtu = ftu − μ2 − Φ21ft−1

P,B

Again, if εM

then OLS does not provide efficient estimates of the monetary policy rule, and may provide
biased estimates of the Taylor rule in small samples.

2.5

Taylor Rules with Serially Correlated Policy Shocks

Backward-looking Taylor rules are observationally equivalent to a policy rule where the Fed
reacts to the entire history of macro variables, but with serially correlated errors. To see this,
we recursively substitute for rt−j , for j ≥ 1, in equation (14) to obtain:
P,AR
,
rt = ct + Ψt (L)fto + εM
t

(16)

P,AR
is a serially correlated

2.6

Forward-Looking Taylor Rules

Finite-Horizon, Forward-Looking Taylor Rules
Clarida and Gertler (1997) and Clarida, Galı́ and Gertler (2000) propose a forward-looking
Taylor rule, where the Fed sets interest rates based on the expected future output gap and
expected future inflation over the next few quarters. For example, a forward-looking Taylor
rule using expected output gap and inflation over the next quarter takes the form:
P,F
rt = γ0 + γ1,g Et (gt+1 ) + γ1,π Et (πt+1) + εM
,
t

(17)

P,F
to be the forward-looking Taylor rule monetary policy shock.
where we define εM
t

We can map the forward-looking Taylor rule (17) into the framework of an affine term
structure model as follows. The conditional expectations of future output gap and inflation are
simply a function of current Xt that can be computed from the state dynamics (2):
Et (Xt+1 ) = μ + ΦXt .
Denoting ei as a vector of zeros with a one in the ith position, we can write equation (17) as:
P,F
rt = γ0 + (γ1,g e1 + γ1,π e2 ) μ + (γ1,g e1 + γ1,π e2) ΦXt + εM
,
t

(18)

as gt and πt are ordered as the first and second elements in Xt .
Equation (18) is an affine short rate equation where the short rate coefficients are a function
of the parameters of the dynamics of Xt :
rt = δ̄0 + δ̄1 Xt ,

(19)

where
δ̄0 = γ0 + (γ1,g e1 + γ1,π e2 ) μ
δ̄1 = Φ (γ1,g e1 + γ1,π e2) + γ1,u e
3,
P,F
≡ γ1,u ftu with γ1,u = δ1,u. Hence, we can identify a forward-looking Taylor rule by
and εM
t

redefining the bond price recursions in equation (8) in terms of the new δ̄0 and δ̄1 coefficients.
The complete term structure model is defined by the same set-up as equations (2)-(5), except
we use the new short rate equation (19) that embodies the forward-looking structure in place of
the basic short rate equation (3). To the extent that lagged values of the output gap and inflation
help forecast their own future values, the vector δ̄1 now has nonzero elements corresponding to
11

the coefficients on lagged macro variables. The relations in equation (19) explicitly show that
the forward-looking Taylor rule structural coefficients (γ0 , γ1,g , γ1,π ) impose restrictions on the
parameters of an affine term structure model.
The new no-arbitrage bond recursions using the restricted coefficients δ̄0 and δ̄1 reflect
the conditional expectations of output gap and inflation that enter in the short rate equation
(19). Furthermore, the conditional expectations Et (gt+1 ) and Et (πt+1 ) are those implied by the
underlying dynamics of gt and πt in the VAR process (2). The monetary policy shocks in the
P,F
forward-looking Taylor rule (17) or (18), εM
, can only be consistently estimated by OLS if
t

ftu is orthogonal to the dynamics of gt and πt .
Since k-period ahead conditional expectations of output gap and inflation remain affine
functions of the current state variables Xt , we can also specify a more general forward-looking
Taylor rule based on expected output gap or inflation over the next k quarters:
P,F
,
rt = γ0 + γ1,g Et (gt+k,k ) + γ1,π Et (πt+k,k ) + εM

Appendix A details the appropriate transformations required to map equation (20) into an affine
term structure model and discusses the estimation procedure for a forward-looking Taylor rule
based on a k-quarter horizon.
Infinite-Horizon, Forward-Looking Taylor Rules
An alternative approach to fixing some forecasting horizon k is to view the Fed as discounting
the entire expected path of future economic conditions. For simplicity, we assume that the Fed
discounts both expected future output gap and expected future inflation at the same discount
rate, β. In this formulation, the forward-looking Taylor rule takes the form:
P,F
,
rt = γ0 + γ1,ĝ ĝt + γ1,π̂ π̂t + εM
t

(21)

where ĝt and π̂t are infinite sums of expected future output gap and inflation, respectively, both
discounted at rate β per period. Many papers have set β at one, or very close to one, sometimes
12

motivated by calibrating it to an average real interest rate (see, among others, Rudebusch and
Svenson, 1999).
We can estimate the discount rate β as part of a standard term structure model by using the
dynamics of Xt in equation (2) to write ĝt as:
∞

ĝt ≡

β i e

Similarly, we can also write discounted future inflation, π̂t, in a similar fashion as:

To place the forward-looking rule with discounting in a term structure model, we re-write
the short rate equation (3) as:
rt = δ̂0 + δ̂1 Xt ,
where

δ̂0 = γ0 + [γ1,ĝ e1 γ1,π̂ e2 ]

Similarly, we modify the bond price recursions for the standard affine model in equation (8) by
using the new δ̂0 and δ̂1 coefficients that embody restrictions on β, γ0 , γ1,ĝ , γ1,π̂ , μ, and Φ.

2.7

Forward- and Backward-Looking Taylor Rules

As a final case, we combine the forward- and backward-looking Taylor rules, so that the
monetary policy rule is computed taking into account forward-looking expectations of macro
variables, lagged realizations of macro variables, while also controlling for lagged short rates.
We illustrate the rule considering expectations for inflation and output gap over the next quarter
(k = 1), but similar rules apply for other horizons.
We start with the standard forward-looking Taylor rule in equation (17):

rt = γ0 + γ1,o
Et (ft+1

where Et (ft+1

(23)

where δ̄1,u is the coefficient on ftu in δ̄1 .
Equation (23) expresses the short rate as a function of both expected future macro factors
and lagged macro factors, the lagged short rate, rt−1 , and a forward- and backward-looking
P,F B
= γ1,u vtu . The forward- and backward-looking Taylor rule
monetary policy shock, εM
t

(23) is an equivalent representation of the forward-looking Taylor rule in (17). Similar to how
the coefficients on contemporaneous macro variables in the backward-looking Taylor rule (14)
are identical to the coefficients in the benchmark Taylor rule (11), the coefficients on future
expected macro variables in the forward- and backward-looking Taylor rule are exactly the
same as the corresponding coefficients in the forward-looking Taylor rule.

2.8

Summary of Taylor Rules

We can identify several structural policy rules from the same reduced-form term structure
model. Table 1 summarizes the various specifications. The benchmark, backward-looking
Taylor rules, and the Taylor rule with serially correlated shocks are different structural rules
that give rise to the same term structure dynamics. Similarly, the forward-looking and the
backward- and forward-looking Taylor rules produce observationally equivalent term structure
models. In all cases, the monetary policy shocks are transformations of either levels or
innovations of the latent term structure variable. Finally, the last column of Table 1 reports if the
no-arbitrage model requires additional restrictions. The forward-looking specifications require
parameter restrictions in the short rate equation to ensure that we compute the expectations of
the macro variables consistent with the dynamics of the VAR.

Data and Econometric Methodology

The objective of this section is to briefly discuss the data and the econometric methodology
used to estimate the model. We relegate all technical issues to Appendix B.
14

3.1

Data

To estimate the model, we use continuously compounded yields of maturities 1, 4, 8, 12, 16,
and 20 quarters, at a quarterly frequency. The bond yields of one year maturity and longer are
from the CRSP Fama-Bliss discount bond files, while the short rate (one-quarter maturity) is
taken from the CRSP Fama risk-free rate file. The sample period is June 1952 to December
2004. The consumer price index and real GDP numbers are taken from the Federal Reserve
Database (FRED) at Saint Louis. The output gap is computed by applying the Hodrick and
Prescott (1997) filter on quarterly real GDP using a smoothing parameter of 1,600. When we
estimate the model, we divide the Hodrick-Prescott output gap measure by 4 so that all the
variables are expressed in per quarter units.
In Figure 1, we plot the output gap, inflation and the short rate (all expressed in annual
units) over time and indicate recessions in solid bars defined by the NBER. As expected, each
recession coincides with decreases in the output gap. Inflation and the short rate are strongly
positively correlated, at 70%, with both inflation and the short rate peaking during the early
and mid-1970s and the monetary targeting period from 1979-1983. In contrast, the short rate
is weakly correlated with the output gap, at 19%. Unconditionally, the output gap and inflation
are almost uncorrelated, with a correlation of 1%, but this does not capture the stronger lead-lag
effects of output and inflation in the VAR, which we show below.

3.2

Estimation and Identification

The VAR dynamics for the state vector in equation (1) are homoskedastic, and since bond
yields (7) in our model are linear in the state vector, they are also Gaussian. We deal with
potential time variation in volatilities and other parameters such as policy-rule coefficients
(as documented by Clarida, Galı́ and Gertler, 2000) by estimating the model over different
subsamples. This approach assumes that bond investors form their expectations in equation
(6) based on recent data. They do not take into account that the economy may return to a
previously observed “regime.” For example, investors during the high-inflation Volcker years
did not anticipate that there would be a return to a low-inflation regime under Greenspan.
We estimate the term structure model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and
Gibbs sampling methods. We assume that all yields are observed with error, so that the equation
for each yield is:
(n)

ŷt

(n)

= yt

15

(n)

+ ηt ,

(24)

(n)

where yt

(n)

is the model-implied yield from equation (7) and ηt

error is IID across time and yields. We specify
standard deviation of the error term as

(n)
ηt

is the zero-mean observation

to be normally distributed and denote the

(n)
ση .

A major advantage of the Bayesian estimation method is that it provides a posterior
distribution of the time-series path of ftu and monetary policy shocks. That is, we can
compute the mean of the posterior distribution of the time-series of ftu through the sample, and,
consequently, we can obtain a best estimate of implied monetary policy shocks. Importantly,
by not assigning one arbitrary yield to have zero measurement error (and the other yields to
have non-zero measurement error), we do not bias our estimated monetary policy shocks to
have undue influence from only one particular yield. Instead, the extracted latent factor reflects
the dynamics of the entire cross-section of yields.
Another advantage of our estimation method is tractability. Although the likelihood
function of yields and related variables can be written down, the model has high dimension
and is non-linear in the parameters. The maximum likelihood estimator involves a difficult
optimization problem, whereas the Bayesian algorithm is based on a series of simulations that
are computationally much more tractable. In a Bayesian estimation setting, we can also specify
priors on reasonable regions of the parameter space that effectively rule out parameter values
that are economically implausible. In our estimation, the only informative prior we impose is
to constrain our state-space system to be stationary.

Empirical Results

Section 4.1 discusses the parameter estimates and the fit of the model to data. Section 4.2
investigates the driving determinants of the yield curve. We compare benchmark, backwardlooking and forward-looking Taylor rules in Section 4.3. Section 4.4 discusses the implied
no-arbitrage monetary policy shocks.

4.1

Parameter Estimates

Table 2 presents the parameter estimates of the term structure model (1)-(5). The first row
of the companion form Φ shows that the output gap is significantly forecasted by the first
lag of inflation. Similarly, a high lagged output gap significantly Granger-causes high current
inflation. In the third row of Φ, both the lagged output gap and lagged inflation significantly
16

predict the latent factor. This is consistent with results in Ang and Piazzesi (2003), who show
that adding macro variables improves out-of-sample forecasts of interest rates. Naturally, the
diagonal coefficients on the first lag reveal that all the variables are highly autocorrelated.
With four lags of the output gap and inflation, many coefficients for the output gap and
inflation corresponding to lags 3 to 4 are insignificant. Including the four lag structure is,
however, necessary for the model to provide sufficient flexibility for the model to fit yearon-year inflation with a quarterly frequency model. For example, the effect of the relatively
large negative coefficient on the second lag of inflation predicting current inflation can only be
captured by adding complicated moving average error terms to a VAR system with only one
lag.
In Table 2, the estimated covariance matrix Σv Σ
v shows that the innovations to inflation
and the output gap are lowly correlated. The conditional covariances between the latent factor
and the macro factors are not significant. This implies that the common recursive identification
strategy in low-frequency VARs (see, for example, Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans, 1996) –
where macro factors do not respond contemporaneously to policy shocks – is automatically
satisfied, but not a priori imposed, and therefore not restrictive at our parameter estimates.
The short-rate coefficients in δ1 are all positive, so higher inflation and output gap lead to
increases in the short rate, which is consistent with the basic Taylor-rule intuition. In particular,
a 1 percent increase in the output gap leads to an increase a 51 basis point (bp) increase in the
short rate, while the effect of a 1 percent increase in contemporaneous inflation leads to a 24bp
increase of the short rate. Below, we compare these magnitudes with OLS estimates of the
Taylor rule.
The risk premia parameters λ̄0 and λ̄1 indicate that macro-factor risk is significantly priced
by the yield curve. There are significant constant prices of risk for g and π in λ̄0 . There are
also many significant prices of time-varying risk in the λ̄1 matrix for all three factors. Hence,
the output gap, inflation, and the latent factor will play important roles in driving time-varying
expected excess returns, as we show below.
The standard deviations of the measurement errors are fairly large. For example, the
measurement-error standard deviation of the one-quarter yield (20-quarter yield) is 18bp (6bp)
per quarter. This is not surprising, because our system only has one latent factor. Interestingly,
short rates have the largest measurement-error variance. This finding suggests that the standard
approach of backing out latent factors from data on selected yields by constraining these yields
to have zero measurement errors may lead to misspecification, especially at the short end of the

17

yield curve. Indeed, Piazzesi (2005) documents evidence for such misspecification by showing
that short rates implied by standard three-factor models are only weakly correlated with those
in the data.
Finally, to summarize the dynamics of the VAR, we plot impulse responses of (gt πt rt )
implied by the model in the left column of Figure 2. Note that the model VAR is specified
in terms of (gt πt ftu ) , so to compute the effects of a 1-percent shock on rt , we invert the
appropriate shock to ftu so that the shocks from (gt πt ftu ) sum to 1-percent in the short rate
equation (3) using a Cholesky decomposition that orders the variables as (gt πt ftu ) . For
comparison, we contrast the model-implied impulse responses with the impulse responses
computed from an empirical VAR(4) on (gt πt rt ) in the right column of Figure 2. The
empirical VAR allows all lags of rt to be non-zero, unlike the model-implied VAR, which
constrains lags 2 to 4 of ftu to be zero (see equation (1)).
The impulse responses generated by our model and the empirical VAR are very similar.
In both the model and the empirical VAR, inflation and the short rate increase after a positive
shock to the output gap, while the short rate increases after an inflation shock. However,
inflation dampens immediately after a 1% shock to r in the responses generated by our model,
while the empirical VAR has a very weak price puzzle (see comments by Sims, 1992) as
inflation initially slightly increases and then drops below zero about 10 quarters later. There
is no price puzzle in the model-implied VAR dynamics. Overall, we conclude that limiting
the model VAR to exclude lags of the latent factor as in equation (1) is inconsequential as it
captures the same macro variable dynamics.
Latent Factor Dynamics
The monetary policy shocks identified by no arbitrage depend crucially on the behavior of the
latent factor, ftu . Figure 3 plots the latent factor together with the OLS Taylor rule residual and
the demeaned short rate. We plot the time-series of the latent factor posterior mean produced
from the Gibbs sampler. The plot illustrates the strong relationship between these three series.
The correlation of the time-series of the posterior mean of the latent factor with output gap
(inflation) is -0.10 (0.61). The corresponding correlation implied by the model posterior mean
point estimates is -0.08 (0.61), which is very similar to the correlations computed using the
posterior mean of the latent factor. These strong correlations suggest that simple OLS estimates
of the Taylor rule (11) may be biased in small samples, which we investigate below. The
correlations between ftu and the yields range between 94% (the short rate) and 98% (the 20-

18

quarter yield). Hence, ftu can be interpreted as level factor, similar to the findings of Ang and
Piazzesi (2003). In comparison, the correlation between ftu and term spreads is near zero.
Matching Moments of Yields and Macro Variables
Table 3 reports the first and second unconditional moments of yields and macro variables
computed from data and implied by the model. We compute standard errors of the data
estimates using GMM. We also report posterior standard deviations of the model-implied
moments. The moments computed from the model are well within two standard deviations
from their counterparts in data for macro variables (Panel A), yields (Panel B), and correlations
(Panel C). Panel A shows that the model provides an almost exact match with the unconditional
moments of inflation and output gap.
Panel B shows that the autocorrelations in data increase from 0.932 for the short rate to
0.962 for the 5-year yield. In comparison, the model-implied autocorrelations exhibit a smaller
range in point estimates from 0.964 for the short rate to 0.962 for the 2-year yield. However, the
model-implied estimates are well within two standard deviations of the data point estimates.
The smaller range of yield autocorrelations implied by the model is due to having only one
latent factor.
Panel C shows that the model is able to match the correlation of the short rate with output
gap and inflation present in the data. The correlation of the short rate with ftu implied by the
model is 0.941. This implies that using the short rate to identify monetary policy shocks may
potentially lead to different estimates than the no-arbitrage shocks identified through ftu .

4.2

What Drives the Dynamics of the Yield Curve?

From the yield equation (7), the variables in Xt explain all yield dynamics in our model. To
understand the role of each state variable in Xt , we compute variance decompositions from
the model and the data. These decompositions are based on Cholesky decompositions of the
innovation variance in the order [gt πt ftu ].
Yield Levels
Panel A of Table 4 reports unconditional variance decompositions of yield levels for various
forecasting horizons. The columns under the heading “Risk Premia” report the proportion of
19

the forecast variance attributable to time-varying risk premia. The remainder is the proportion
of the variance implied by the predictability embedded in the VAR dynamics without risk
premia, under the EH.
To compute the variance of yields due to risk premia, we partition the bond coefficient bn
on Xt in equation (7) into an EH term and into a risk-premia term:
+ bRP
bn = bEH
n
n ,
bond pricing coefficient by setting the prices of risk λ1 = 0. We let
where we compute the bEH
n
ΩF,h represent the forecast variance of the factors Xt at horizon h, where ΩF,h = var(Xt+h −
(n)

Et (Xt+h )). Since yields are given by yt

= bn + b
n Xt , the forecast variance of the n-maturity

F,h
bn . We compute the unconditional forecast variance using
yield at horizon h is given by b
nΩ

a horizon of h = 100 quarters.
We decompose the forecast variance of yields as follows:


Risk Premia Proportion =

ΩF,h bRP
bRP
n

F,h b
b
Ω

Note that this risk premia proportion reports only the pure risk premia term and ignores any
covariances of the risk premia with the state variables. Panel A of Table 4 shows that risk
premia play important roles in explaining the level of yields. Unconditionally, the pure risk
premia proportion of the 20-quarter yield is 30%. As the maturity increases, the importance of
the risk premia increases. Panel B shows that risk premia matter even more for yield spreads.
Over one half of the variance of yield spreads is due to time-varying risk premia.
The numbers under the line “Variance Decompositions” report the variance decompositions


F,h
for the total forecast variance, b
bn and the pure risk premia variance, bRP

respectively. The total variance decompositions reveal that, unconditionally, the shocks to
macro variables explain about 65-75% of the total variance of yield levels. Shocks to inflation
are slightly more important than shocks to output gap in explaining the forecast variance of
yield levels. In the pure risk premia term, the proportion of variance attributable to output gap
and inflation is also around 50%.

20

Yield Spreads
Panel B of Table 4 reports variance decompositions of yield spreads of maturity n quarters in
(n)

(1)

excess of the one-quarter yield, yt − yt . The variance decompositions in Panel B document
that shocks to the macro variables are by far the main driving force of yield spreads, with the
unexplained latent factor portion being generally less than 10%. In particular, shocks to output
gap explain more than 62% of the variance of yield spreads and inflation shocks account for
approximately 20% of the unconditional variance of the 5-year spread.
Expected Excess Holding Period Returns
Panel C of Table 4 examines variance decompositions of expected excess holding period
returns. By definition, time-varying expected excess returns must be due only to time-varying
risk premia, which is why the total and pure risk premia variance decompositions are identical.
Panel C shows that the proportion of the expected excess return variance explained by macro
variables is about 50% for all maturities. Inflation is a little more important for explaining
time-varying excess returns than output gap, with the proportion for inflation reaching close to
33% for the 20-quarter bond. Thus, inflation and inflation risk impressively account for over
one half of the dynamics of expected excess returns.2
Table 5 further characterizes conditional expected excess returns. Panel A reports the means
and standard deviations of the approximate excess returns computed from data and implied by
the model. To compute the one-quarter excess returns on holding, say, the 20-quarter bond
from t to t + 1, we would need data on the price of the 19-quarter bond at t + 1. Because of
data availability, we implement the approximation by Campbell and Shiller (1991):
(n)

arxt+1 = log

Pt+1
(n)

Pt

− rt .

(25)

Panel A shows that the moments of excess returns computed from the model are nearly identical
to their (approximate) counterparts in data. Hence, our model matches unconditional excess
returns almost exactly. The time-varying prices of risk are essential in this good fit. If λ1 is set
2

We also estimated a simpler system using quarter-on-quarter GDP growth, quarter-on-quarter inflation

(measured using the GDP deflator), and a latent factor with only one lag in the VAR. This system produces similar
variance decomposition attributions for yield levels and expected excess holding period returns, but assigns higher
variance decompositions to inflation than Table 4. This is because the output gap is more persistent than GDP
growth. Nevertheless, the proportion of the risk premia for yield levels, yield spreads, or excess returns, are very
similar using either output gaps or GDP growth.

21

to zero, the model’s ability to match excess returns deteriorates substantially, with the model
implied mean (standard deviation) of the excess return on the 20-quarter bond changing to
0.63% (2.78%), compared to 0.23% (3.30%) in the data.
Panel B reports regressions of (approximate) excess returns onto macro factors and yield
variables both in data and implied by the model. We choose the 20-quarter yield to be
representative of a level factor. The predictability of one-quarter excess returns is fairly weak,
compared to the results for longer holding periods reported by Cochrane and Piazzesi (2005).
Nevertheless, comparing the model-implied coefficients with the data reveals that the model
is able to closely match the predictability patterns in the data. In particular, for the excess
returns of longer maturity bonds, the significantly negative (positive) coefficients on inflation
(the 20-quarter yield) are well within one standard deviation of their counterparts in data. The
point estimates of the loadings on the output gap and inflation both increase in magnitude with
maturity, indicating that long bond excess returns are more affected by macro factor variation.
Note that if λ1 were set to zero, the coefficients in the Panel B regressions would be zero,
ignoring approximation and Jensen’s inequality terms.
Panel C reports the coefficients of the conditional (exact) expected excess holding period
return defined in equation (10). To make the coefficients easier to interpret, we report the
summed coefficients on all lags of g and π. The Bnx coefficients on the contemporaneous and
lagged output gap and inflation are negative, indicating that conditional expected excess returns
are counter-cyclical. High output gaps and high inflation rates are more likely to occur during
the peaks of economic expansions, so excess returns of holding long-term bonds are lowest
during the peaks of economic expansions. The exposure to this counter-cyclical risk premium
also increases as the maturity of the bond increases.
Figure 4 plots the time-series of one-period expected excess holding period returns for the
4-quarter and 20-quarter bond. We compute the expected excess returns using the posterior
mean of the latent factors through the sample. Expected excess returns are much more volatile
for the long maturity bond, reaching a high of over 12% per year during the 1982 recession
and drop below -5% during 1953, 1973 and, 1978. In contrast, expected excess returns for
the 4-quarter bond lie in a more narrow range between -1.3% and 3.8% per year. During
every recession, expected excess returns increase. In particular, the increase in expected excess
returns for the 20-quarter bond at the onset of the 1981 recession is dramatic, rising from 4.0%
per year in March 1981 to 12.9% per year in December 1981.3
3

At 1981:Q4, the 12.9% expected excess return for the 20-quarter bond can be broken down into the various

proportions: 174% to the constant term premium, 10% to the output gap, -65% to inflation, and -19% to the latent

22

4.3

A Comparison of Taylor Rules

We now compare the benchmark, backward-looking, and forward-looking Taylor rules
estimated by no-arbitrage techniques. We first discuss the estimates of each Taylor rule in
turn, and then compare the monetary policy shocks computed from various specifications.
The Benchmark Taylor Rule
Panel A of Table 6 contrasts the OLS and model-implied estimates of the benchmark Taylor
rule in equation (11). Over the full sample, the OLS estimate of the output coefficient is 0.34,
and this is highly significant. The model-implied coefficient is similar in magnitude at 0.51.
The OLS estimate of the inflation coefficient is over twice as large at 0.90 and also strongly
significant. In contrast, the model-implied coefficient on πt of 0.24 is much smaller than the
OLS estimate. Hence, OLS over-estimates the response of the Fed on the short rate by over
two-thirds compared to the model-implied estimate.
There are two main reasons for the differences between the standard OLS estimate and
the model-implied coefficients. First, the model accounts for the endogenous fluctuations in
inflation and output, which are correlated with monetary policy shocks. This contemporaneous
correlation causes OLS coefficients to be biased in small samples.

Second, the model

estimation extracts information about the policy rule from the entire panel of yield data and
not only the time series of the short rate. This approach increases efficiency, which we can
see from the number in brackets reported below the model and OLS estimates in Table 6.
These numbers must be carefully compared since OLS regressions produce classical standard
errors, while Bayesian estimations produce posterior standard deviations, but we see that our
estimation produces tighter posterior standard deviations than regular OLS standard errors.
To further investigate the difference between OLS and model estimates, we compute the
OLS coefficients and the OLS R2 of the benchmark Taylor rule implied by the model, i.e.,
the model-implied OLS coefficients on gt and πt while omitting the latent factor ftu from
the equation. These coefficients are 0.005 for the constant, 0.37 (0.91) for the output gap
(inflation) – almost identical to the OLS regression coefficients. Moreover, the model-implied
OLS regression R2 is 57%, very similar to the OLS R2 of 52%. These results suggest that the
larger magnitude of the OLS regression estimate of the inflation coefficient in the benchmark
factor. Note that there is a large exposure, in absolute values, to the macro factors. Although the exposure to
the latent factor is large at this date, the implied monetary policy shock is much smaller, as it is the scaled latent
factor, δ1,u ftu . We discuss this below in further detail.

23

Taylor rule compared to the model-implied coefficient is due to an omitted variable that is
correlated with output gap and inflation.
By estimating the model over the full sample, we follow Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans
(1996), and others, who all assume that the Taylor rule relationships are stable. Interestingly,
our results for the benchmark Taylor rule are indeed fairly stable when we estimate the
model across different subsamples. (Below we show that this result does not apply to other
specifications of the Taylor rule.) Panel A of Table 6 reports estimates of both OLS Taylor rules
and the benchmark Taylor rule estimated by no-arbitrage restrictions over the pre-1982 and
post-1983 monetary policy regimes.4 For example, the model (OLS) coefficient on inflation
is 0.23 (0.98) over the pre-1982 sample and 0.52 (1.83) over the post-1983 sample, compared
with 0.24 (0.90) over the whole sample. The model coefficients on output gap are also fairly
stable, at 0.41 (0.46) over the pre-1982 (post-1982) period. In contrast, the OLS coefficient
on output gap differs widely across the samples, ranging from 0.28 in the pre-1982 sample
to 0.55 in the post-1982 sample. Hence, the OLS coefficients of output gap are much more
dissimilar across the pre-1982 and post-1983 samples compared to the no-arbitrage Taylor rule
estimation.
The Backward-Looking Taylor Rule
Panel B of Table 6 reports the estimation results for the backward-looking Taylor rule.
Consistent with equation (14), the model coefficients on gt and πt are unchanged from the
benchmark Taylor rule in Panel A at 0.51 and 0.24, respectively. The corresponding OLS
estimates of the backward-looking Taylor rule coefficients on output gap and inflation are
0.38 and 0.32, respectively. Here, OLS estimates of the backward-looking rule are closer
to the model-implied estimates compared to the benchmark Taylor rule, particularly for
contemporaneous and lagged inflation.
As expected, the coefficients on the lagged short rate in both the OLS estimates and the
model-implied estimates are similar to the autocorrelation of the short rate (0.93 in Table 3).
The large and significant coefficient on the lagged short rate reflects interest-rate smoothing.
We can rewrite the backward-looking Taylor rule in partial-adjustment format as follows:
P,B
.
rt = (1 − 0.911)(5.719gt + 2.674πt − 4.180gt−1 − 1.393πt−1 ) + 0.911rt−1 + εM
t
4

Several recent studies have emphasized that the linear policy coefficients on the output gap and inflation

potentially vary over time (see, among others, Cogley and Sargent, 2001). However, other authors like Sims and
Zha (2006) find either little or no evidence for time-varying policy rules.

24

Hence, our model implies a long-run response to inflation of 2.674 − 1.393 = 1.281. This is
consistent with the Taylor principle that the coefficient on inflation should be larger than one
(see comments by Taylor, 1999).
As already mentioned above, we find that the estimates of the backward-looking Taylor
rule change across subsamples. Panel B in Table 6 shows that interest-rate smoothing is more
important in the post-1983 sample than in the pre-1982 sample. The coefficient on the lagged
interest rate goes up from 0.87 to 0.94 in the model estimation. We also find that the model
estimation finds a higher long-run response to inflation in the more recent sample than in the
earlier sample. These findings – more recently, both interest-rate smoothing and the inflation
response have become stronger – are consistent with those by Clarida, Galı́ and Gertler (2000).
The Taylor Rule with Serially Correlated Shocks
Figure 5 plots the monetary policy shocks of the Taylor rule with serially correlated errors (see
equation (16)) as well as the OLS Taylor rule residual for comparison. Not surprisingly, the
serially correlated shocks are much smoother. As a measure of how much predictable variation
is contained in the short rate as it responds to contemporaneous and lagged macro variables,
we plot the fitted short rate implied from the serially correlated Taylor rule in the bottom panel.
From equation (16), we can construct a fitted short rate, rtAR , where
rtAR = ct + Ψt (L)fto
is the predictable variation in the short rate from the entire past history of macro factors. The
fitted short rate bears a very high resemblance to the level of the short rate in data, and the
R2 of regressing the short rate in data onto rtAR is over 71%. Thus, although short rates do
not resemble contemporaneous output gap or inflation, in a serially correlated Taylor rule, the
entire past history of output gap and inflation contains a lot of information about the level of
the short rate.
The Finite-Horizon, Forward-Looking Taylor Rule
In Panel C of Table 6, we list the estimates of the forward-looking Taylor rule coefficients
γ1,g and γ1,π in equation (20) for various horizons k. For all the forward-looking Taylor rules,
we re-estimate the term structure model holding the μ, Φ, and Σ in equation (2) fixed to the
same values as the benchmark estimation, but only report the forward-looking Taylor rule
coefficients for comparison. A different estimation is performed for each horizon k. By holding
25

the VAR parameters constant across the specifications, we concentrate only on the effect of
different horizons in the forward-looking Taylor rule, but allow best fits to the prices of risk
across the term structure.
For a one-quarter ahead forward-looking Taylor rule, the coefficient on expected output gap
(inflation) is 0.59 (0.29). These are larger than the contemporaneous responses for output gap
and inflation over the past quarter in the benchmark Taylor rule, which are 0.51 and 0.24,
respectively. For a one-year (k = 4) horizon, the short interest rate responds even more
aggressively to output gap and inflation expectations, with γ1,g = 0.74 and γ1,π = 0.37. The
response of the Fed to future inflation expectations increases quickly as the horizon increases.
As k increases, the posterior standard deviations increase so that the γ1,g and γ1,π
coefficients become less precisely estimated. As k becomes large, the conditional expectations
approach their unconditional expectations, or Et (gt+k,k ) → E(gt ) and Et (πt+k,k ) → E(πt ).
Econometrically, this makes γ1,g and γ1,π hard to identify for large k, and unidentified in the
limit as k → ∞. The intuition behind this result is that as k → ∞, the only variable driving
the dynamics of the short rate in equation (20) is the latent monetary policy shock:
P,F
rt = γ0 + γ1,g E(gt ) + γ1,π E(πt) + εM
,
t

and in the limit as k → ∞, it is impossible to differentiate the (scaled) effect of output gap or
inflation expectations from γ0 .
The Infinite-Horizon, Forward-Looking Taylor Rule
We report the estimates of the infinite-horizon, forward-looking Taylor rule (21) in Panel D of
Table 6. The coefficient on future discounted output gap (inflation) is 0.17 (0.05). The discount
rate β = 0.857, which implies an effective horizon of 1/(1 − 0.857) quarters, or 1.75 years.
This estimate is much lower than the discount rates close to 0.99 used in the literature (see,
for example, Rudebusch and Svenson, 1999; Favero and Rovelli, 2003), but still much higher
than the estimate of 0.76 calibrated by Collins and Siklos (2004). The effective horizon of
approximately two years is consistent with transcripts of FOMC meetings, which indicate that
the Fed often weighs forecasts and policy scenarios of up to three to five years ahead.
The Forward- and Backward-Looking Taylor Rule
For completeness, Panel E of Table 6 reports the estimates of the forward- and backwardlooking Taylor rule for horizons of k = 1 and k = 4 quarters. These are the same restricted
26

estimations as the forward-looking Taylor rules in Panel C for the corresponding horizons and,
hence, have the same coefficients on Et (gt+k,k ) and Et (πt+k,k ) as explained in Section 2.7.
Naturally, the lagged short rate continues to play a large role. The summed coefficients on
the lagged output gap and inflation variables cannot be as easily interpreted as the coefficients
on the first lag of macro variables in the backward-looking rule. Nevertheless, the relatively
large magnitude of these coefficients suggest that for traditional forward-looking Taylor rule
estimates which use instruments for Et (gt+k,k ) and Et (πt+k,k ), long lags of macro variables
would still be necessary to capture the endogenous correlated effects of latent monetary policy
shocks.

4.4

An Example of No-Arbitrage Monetary Policy Shocks

The monetary policy shocks identified by no arbitrage are transformations of either levels or
innovations of the latent factor. There are different no-arbitrage policy shocks depending on the
chosen structural specification, like benchmark, forward-looking, or backward-looking Taylor
rules. Note that the implied policy shock is a choice of a particular structural rule, and the same
reduced-form no-arbitrage model can produce several versions of monetary policy shocks (see
Table 1).
As an example, we graph the model-implied monetary policy shocks based on the
backward-looking Taylor rule in Figure 6 and contrast them with OLS estimates of the
backward Taylor rule. We plot the OLS estimate in the top panel and the model-implied shocks,
P,B
P,B
εM
, from equation (14) in the bottom panel. We compute εM
using the posterior mean
t
t

estimates of the latent factor through time. Figure 6 shows that the model-implied shocks
are much smaller than the shocks estimated by OLS. In particular, during the early 1980s,
the OLS shocks range from below -6% to above 4%. In contrast, the model-implied shocks
lie between -3% and 2% during this period. This indicates that according to the no-arbitrage
estimates, the Volcker-experience was not as big a surprise as suggested by OLS. These results
are consistent with our findings that the pre-1982 and post-1983 estimates of the Taylor rule
using no-arbitrage identification techniques are quite similar.

5

Conclusion

We exploit information from the entire term structure to estimate monetary policy rules. The
framework accommodates original Taylor (1993) rules that describe the Fed as reacting to
27

current values of output gap and inflation; backward-looking Taylor rules where the Fed reacts
to current and lagged macro variables and lagged policy rates; and forward-looking Taylor rules
where the Fed takes into account conditional expectations of future real activity and inflation.
The framework also accommodates Taylor rules with serially correlated policy shocks. An
advantage of this approach is that all these types of Taylor rules can be estimated jointly in a
unified system that provides consistent expectations of future interest rates and macro factors.
Our methodology embeds the Taylor rules in a term structure model with time-varying risk
premia that excludes arbitrage opportunities. The absence of arbitrage implies that long yields
are expected values of future short rates after adjusting for risk. The tractability of the system is
based on flexible VAR dynamics for the macro and latent state variables and by specifying risk
premia that are also linear combinations of the VAR state variables. In our model, monetary
policy shocks are transformations of either levels or innovations to the latent factor, depending
on the Taylor rule specification. The cross-equation restrictions implied by no arbitrage help
us to estimate this shock more efficiently.
We find that output gap and inflation shocks account for over half of the time-variation
of time-varying excess bond returns and almost all of the movements in the term spread.
Macro factors induce a counter-cyclical risk premium for holding long-term bonds. We
find that monetary policy rules identified by no-arbitrage are more stable over time than
classical estimates of Taylor (1993) rule coefficients. Monetary policy shocks implied by
backward-looking policy rules estimated with no-arbitrage restrictions are less volatile than
their counterparts estimated by OLS. Interesting extensions of our approach are to impose
more structure on the VAR dynamics, to expand the state space to include other macro factors,
or to embed the no-arbitrage identification techniques in more structural models.

Appendix
A

Forward-Looking Taylor Rules

In this appendix, we describe how to compute δ̄0 , δ̄1 in equation (19) of a forward-looking Taylor rule for a kquarter horizon. From the dynamics of Xt in equation (2), the conditional expectation of k-quarter ahead GDP
growth and inflation can be written as:
 k

 k

Φ̃i =

Φj = (I − Φ)−1 (I − Φi ).

(A-2)

The bond price recursions for the standard affine model in equation (8) are thus based on the short rate equation

(A-3)

As k → ∞, both Et (gt+k,k ) and Et (πt+k,k ) approach their unconditional means and there is no statedependence. Hence, the limit of the short rate equation in equation (20) as k → ∞ is:
rt = γ0 + [γ1,g e1 γ1,π e2 ] (I − Φ)−1 μ + γ1,u ftu ,

(A-4)

which implies that when k is large, the short rate effectively becomes a function only of ftu , and gt and πt can only
indirectly affect the term structure through the feedback in the VAR equation (2). In the limiting case k = ∞, the
coefficients γ1,g and γ1,π are unidentified because they act exactly like the constant term γ0 .

B

Estimating the Model

We estimate the model by MCMC with a Gibbs sampling algorithm. The parameters of the model are Θ =
(μ, Φ, Σ, δ0 , δ1 , μQ , ΦQ , ση ), where μQ and ΦQ are parameters governing the state variable process under the
(n)
risk neutral probability measure, ση denotes the vector of observation error volatilities {ση }. We draw μQ and
Q
−1
Q
−1
Q
Φ , but invert λ0 and λ1 using λ0 = Σ (μ − μ ), and λ1 = Σ (Φ − Φ ). The latent factor f u = {ftu } is
also generated in each iteration of the Gibbs sampler. We simulate 50,000 iterations of the Gibbs sampler after an
initial burn-in period of 10,000 observations.
We now detail the procedure for drawing each of these variables. We denote the factors X = {Xt } and the
(n)
(n)
set of yields for all maturities in data as Ŷ = {ŷt }. Note that the model-implied yields Y = {yt } differ from
the yields in data, Ŷ by observation error. Note that observing X is equivalent to observing the term structure Y
through the bond recursions in equation (8).

29

Drawing the Latent Factor f u
The factor dynamics (2), together with the yield equations (24), imply that the term structure model can be written
as a state-space system. The state and observation equations for the system are linear in ftu , but also involve the
macro variables gt and πt . To generate f u , we use the Carter and Kohn (1994) forward-backward algorithm.
We first run the Kalman filter forward taking the macro variables (gt , πt ) to be exogenous variables, and then
sample f u backwards. We use a Kalman filter algorithm that includes time-varying exogenous variables in the
state equation. Since we specify the mean of f u to be zero for identification, we set each generated draw of f u to
have a mean of zero.
Drawing μ and Φ
We follow Johannes and Polson (2005) and explicitly differentiate between {μ, Φ} and {μQ , ΦQ }. As Xt follows
a VAR in equation (2), the draw of μ and Φ is standard Gibbs sampling with conjugate normal priors and
posteriors. We note that the posterior of μ and Φ conditional on X, Ŷ and the other parameters is:
P (μ, Φ | Θ− , X, Ŷ )

∝

P (Ŷ | Θ, X)P (X | μ, Φ, Σ)P (μ, Φ)

∝
∝

Q

(B-1)

Q

P (Ŷ | Σ, δ0 , δ1 , μ , Φ , ση , X)P (X | μ, Φ, Σ)P (μ, Φ)
P (X | μ, Φ, Σ)P (μ, Φ),

where Θ− denotes the set of all parameters except μ and Φ. P (X|μ, Φ, Σ) is the likelihood function, which is
normally distributed from the assumption of normality for the errors in the VAR. The validity of going from the
first line to the second line is ensured by the bond recursion in equation (8): given μQ and ΦQ , the bond price is
independent of μ and Φ. We specify the prior P (μ, Φ) to be N (0, 1000), so, consequently, the posterior of (μ, Φ)
is a natural conjugate normal distribution and the draw of μ and Φ is standard Gibbs sampling. We draw μ and Φ
separately for each equation in the VAR system (2).
Drawing ΣΣ
To draw ΣΣ , we note that the posterior of ΣΣ conditional on X, Ŷ and the other parameters is:
P (ΣΣ | Θ− , X, Ŷ ) ∝ P (Ŷ | Θ, X)P (X | μ, Φ, Σ)P (ΣΣ),

(B-2)

where Θ− denotes the set of all parameters except Σ. This posterior suggests an Independence Metropolis draw.
We draw ΣΣ from the proposal density q(ΣΣ ) = P (X | μ, Φ, Σ)P (ΣΣ), which is an Inverse Wishart (IW )
distribution if we specify the prior P (ΣΣ ) to be IW , so that q(ΣΣ ) is an IW natural conjugate. The proposal
draw (ΣΣ )m+1 for the (m + 1)th draw is then accepted with probability α, where


P ((ΣΣ)m+1 | Θ− , X, Ŷ ) q((ΣΣ )m )
α = min

P ((ΣΣ)m | Θ− , X, Ŷ ) q((ΣΣ )m+1 )


P (Ŷ | (ΣΣ )m+1 , Θ− , X)
,1 ,
(B-3)
= min
P (Ŷ | (ΣΣ )m , Θ− , X)
where P (Ŷ |μ, Φ, Θ−, X) is the likelihood function, which is normally distributed from the assumption of
normality for the observation errors η (n) . From equation (B-3), α is just the ratio of the likelihoods of the new
draw of ΣΣ relative to the old draw.
Drawing δ1
We draw δ1 using a Random Walk Metropolis step:
δ1m+1 = δ1m + ζδ1 v

(B-4)

where v ∼ N (0, 1) and ζδ1 is the scaling factor used to adjust the acceptance rate. The acceptance probability α

30

for δ1 is given by:



α =
=

P (δ1m+1 | Θ− , X, Ŷ ) q(δ1m | δ1m+1 )
min

P (δ1m | Θ− , X, Ŷ ) q(δ1m+1 | δ1m


P (δ1m+1 | Θ− , X, Ŷ )

P (δ1m | Θ− , X, Ŷ )



(B-5)

where the posterior P (δ1 |Θ−, X, Ŷ ) is given by:
P (δ1 |Θ−, X, Ŷ ) ∝ P (Ŷ |δ1 , Θ− , X)P (δ1 ).
Thus, in the case of the draw for δ1 , α is the posterior ratio of the new and old draws of δ1 . We set δ0 to match the
sample mean of the short rate.
To draw γ1 in the forward-looking Taylor rule system, we rewrite the short rate in data as a regression:
(1)

ŷt

(1)

= γ0 + γ1 X̄t + ηt ,

where X̄t = [Et (gt+k,k Et (πt+k,k ) ftu ], and we can compute the conditional expectations for GDP growth and
inflation implied from the VAR parameters at every date t. We generate a proposal draw from the regression for
γ1 , and then accept/reject based on the likelihood of the bond yields. We first draw a proposal for the (m + 1)th
value of γ1 from the proposal density:
(1)

q(γ1 ) ∝ P (ŷt

| γ0 , γ1 , X, η (1))P (γ1 ),

where we specify the prior P (γ1 ) to be normally distributed, so, consequently, q(γ1 ) is a natural conjugate normal
distribution. The proposal draw γ1m+1 , is then accepted with probability α, where


P (γ1m+1 | Θ− , X, Ŷ ) q(γ1m )
α = min
m+1 , 1
P (γ1m | Θ− , X, Ŷ ) q(γ1 )


P (Ŷ− | γ1m+1 , Θ−, X)
= min
,1 ,
(B-6)
P (Ŷ− | γ1m , Θ−, X)
where P (Yˆ− |γ1 , Θ− , X) is the likelihood function of yields other than the short rate r̂, which is normally
distributed from the assumption of normality for the observation errors η (n) . We set γ0 to match the sample
mean of the short rate.
Drawing μQ and ΦQ
We draw μQ and ΦQ with a Random Walk Metropolis algorithm. We assume a flat prior. We draw each parameter
separately in μQ , and each row in ΦQ . The accept/reject probability for the draws of μQ and ΦQ is similar to
equation (B-5). In each iteration, we invert λ0 and λ1 and report the estimates of the prices of risk instead of μQ
and ΦQ , as it is easier to interpret market prices of risk than parameters under the risk-neutral measure.
Drawing ση
Drawing the variance of the observation errors, ση2 , is straightforward, because we can view the observation errors
(n)

η as regression residuals from equation (24). We draw the observation variance (ση )2 separately from each yield.
We specify a conjugate prior IG(0, 0.00001), so that the posterior distribution of ση2 is a natural conjugate Inverse
Gamma distribution. The prior information roughly translates into a 30bp bid-ask spread in Treasury securities,
which is consistent with studies on the liquidity of spot Treasury market yields(see, for example, Fleming, 2000).
Drawing β
For the case of the forward-looking Taylor rule over an infinite horizon with discounting, we augment the
parameter space to include the discount rate, β. To draw β, we use an Independence Metropolis-Hastings step.

31

The candidate draw, β m+1 , is drawn from a proposal density, q(β m+1 | β m ) = q(β m+1 ), which we specify to
be a doubly truncated normal distribution, with mean 0.95 and standard deviation 0.03 but truncated at 0.8 from
below and at 0.99 from above.
Assuming a flat prior, the acceptance probability α for β m+1 is given by:


P (β m+1 | Θ− , X, Ŷ ) q(β m )
α = min
,1
P (β m | Θ− , X, y) q(β m+1 )


P (Ŷ | β m+1 , Θ− , X) q(β m )
= min
,1 ,
(B-7)
P (Ŷ | β m , Θ− , X) q(β m+1 )
where Θ− represents all the parameters except the β parameter that is being drawn and P (Ŷ |β, Θ− , X) is the
likelihood function.

Checks for Convergence
To check the reliability of our estimation approach, we perform several exercises. First, we tried starting the chain
from many different initial values on real data and we obtained almost exactly the same results for the posterior
means and standard deviations of the parameters. We also check that the posterior distributions for the parameters
Θ are unimodal.
Second, we compute the Raftery and Lewis (1992) minimum burn-in and the minimum number of runs
required to estimate the 0.025 quantile to within ±0.025 with probability 0.95, using every draw in the MCMCGibbs algorithm, which is conservative. For all the parameters (with one exception) and the complete time-series
of the latent factors f u , the minimum required burn-in is only several hundred and the minimum number of runs
is several thousand. This is substantially below the burn-in sample (10,000) and the number of iterations (50,000)
for our estimation.
The third, and probably most compelling check of the estimation method is that the MCMC-Gibbs sampler
works very well on simulated data. We take the posterior means of the parameters in Table 2 as the population
values and simulate a small sample of 203 quarterly observations, which is the same length as our data. Applying
our MCMC algorithm to the simulated small sample, we find that the draws of the VAR parameters (μ, Φ, Σ),
the short rate parameters (δ0 , δ1 ), the constant prices of risk (λ0 ), and the observation error standard deviations
(n)
(ση ) converge extremely fast. After our estimation procedure, the posterior means for these parameters are
all well within one posterior standard deviation of the population parameters. We find that a burn-in sample of
only 1,000 observations is sufficient to start drawing values for these parameters that closely correspond to the
population distributions. The time-varying prices of risk (λ1 ) were estimated less precisely on the simulated data,
but the posterior means of eight out of nine prices of risk were also within one posterior standard deviation of the
population parameters. The algorithm is also successful in estimating the time-series of the latent factor f u , where
the true series of f u in the simulated sample lies within one posterior standard deviation bound of the posterior
mean of the generated f u from the Gibbs sampler.

32

In summary, these results verify that we can reliably estimate the parameters of the term structure model
given our sample size and, thus, we are very confident about the convergence of our algorithm.
Econometric Identification
For our benchmark model, our identification strategy is to set the mean of ftu to be zero and to pin down δ1,u
while the conditional variance matrix ΣΣ is unconstrained. To ensure that ftu is mean zero, we parameterize

μ = [μg μπ μf ] so that μf solves the equation:
−1
e
μ = 0,
3 (I − Φ)

where e3 is a vector of zeros with a one in the third position. We set δ1,u = 1. We find that fixing δ1,u to other
values does not change the estimates of δ1,o because the latent factor can be arbitrarily scaled.
To match the mean of the short rate in the sample, we set δ0 in each Gibbs iteration so that:
δ0 = r̄ − δ1 X̄,

(B-8)

where r̄ is the average short rate from data and X̄ is the time-series average of the factors Xt , which change
because ftu is drawn in each iteration. This means that δ0 is not individually drawn as a separate parameter, but
δ0 changes its value in each Gibbs iteration because it is a function of δ1 and the draws of the latent factor ftu .

Note: The table summarizes the various Taylor Rule specifications identified using no-arbitrage conditions of Sections 2.3 to 2.8. The models
in the equivalence column indicates that the Taylor rule specification is equivalent in the sense that one term structure model gives rise to both
Taylor rule specifications. The variable ftu represents the latent term structure factor and the restrictions refer to parameter restrictions in the short
rate equation imposed to take future expectations of the macro variables consistent with the VAR dynamics of the model (see Section 2.6).

Note: Panel A lists moments of the output gap and inflation in data and implied by the model. For the
model, we construct the posterior distribution of unconditional moments by computing the unconditional
moments implied from the parameters in each iteration of the Gibbs sampler. Panel B reports data and model
unconditional moments of n-quarter maturity yields. We compute the posterior distribution of the modelimplied yields using the generated latent factors in each iteration. In Panel C, we report correlations of the
short rate with various factors. For the model, we compute the posterior distribution of the correlations of
the model-implied short rate r in equation (3). In all the panels, the data standard errors (in parentheses) are
computed using GMM and all moments are computed at a quarterly frequency. For the model, we report
posterior means and standard deviations (in parentheses) of each moment. The sample period is June 1952 to
December 2004 and the data frequency is quarterly.

Note: Panel A lists moments of one-quarter approximate excess holding period returns, arxt+1 , in the
data and implied by the model (see equation (25)). For the model, we construct the posterior distribution
of unconditional moments by computing the unconditional moments implied from the parameters in each
iteration of the Gibbs sampler. Panel B regresses one-quarter approximate excess holding period returns for
(n)
an n-period bond, arxt+1 onto the output gap, inflation, and the 20-quarter bond yield. The standard errors
for the OLS estimates from data (in parentheses) are computed using robust standard errors. We compute the
model-implied coefficients and R2 as follows. We construct the posterior distributions of the model-implied
estimates by computing the implied coefficients from the model parameters in each iteration of the Gibbs
sampler. We report posterior means and standard deviations (in parentheses) of each coefficient. Panel C
reports the coefficients, summing the values over all lags of each factor, of the conditional expected excess
holding period return defined in equation (10) on the factors. The data frequency is quarterly and the sample
period is June 1952 to December 2004.

Note: Panel A reports the OLS and model-implied estimates of the benchmark Taylor (1993) rule in equation
(11) over the full sample and over subperiods; Panel B reports the backward-looking Taylor rule (12); Panel C
reports the finite-horizon, forward-looking Taylor rule without discounting in equation (20); Panel D reports
the infinite-horizon, forward-looking Taylor rule with discounting in equation (21); and Panel E reports
estimates of the forward- and backward-looking Taylor rule in Section 2.7. In Panel E, we report the sums
of the coefficients of the output gap and inflation over all four lags. For the forward-looking Taylor rules in
Panels C-E, we hold the estimates of the VAR parameters in equation (2) and re-estimate the forward-looking
Taylor rule coefficients together with the prices of risk. For the model-implied coefficients, we construct
the posterior distribution of Taylor rule coefficients by computing the implied coefficients from the model
parameters in each iteration of the Gibbs sampler. We report posterior means and standard deviations (in
parentheses) of each coefficient. The standard errors for the OLS estimates (in parentheses) are computed
using robust standard errors. In each panel, the data frequency is quarterly and the full sample period is from
June 1952 to December 2004.

The panels show responses of the output gap, inflation, and the short rate to 1% shocks to the output gap
g, inflation π, and the short rate r. The left column shows responses implied by the model, while the right
column presents response functions computed from an unrestricted VAR(4) of (gt πt rt ) . We compute the
1% r shock from the model by scaling an f shock so that the short rate changes by 1%. We show quarters
on the x-axis. The impulse responses are computed using a Cholesky decomposition that orders the variables
(g, π, f) for the model and (g, π, r) for the unrestricted VAR.

We plot the posterior mean of the latent factor ftu , the demeaned short rate from data, and the residuals from
the OLS estimate of the basic Taylor Rule, which is computed by running OLS on equation (11). The latent
factor, short rate, and OLS residuals are all annualized.
