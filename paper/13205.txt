JEL No. F3,F31,F41
ABSTRACT
Two well-known, but seemingly contradictory, features of exchange rates are that they are close to
a random walk while at the same time exchange rate changes are predictable by interest rate differentials.
In this paper we investigate whether these two features of the data may in fact be related. In particular,
we ask whether the predictability of exchange rates by interest differentials naturally results when
participants in the FX market adopt random walk expectations. We find that random walk expectations
can explain the forward discount puzzle, but only if FX portfolio positions are revised infrequently.
In contrast, with frequent portfolio adjustment and random walk expectations, we find that high interest
rate currencies depreciate much more than what UIP would predict.

Introduction

Two well-known, but seemingly contradictory, features of exchange rates are that
they are close to a random walk (RW) while at the same time exchange rate
changes are predictable by interest rate di erentials. The RW hypothesis received
strong support from the work of Richard A. Meese and Kenneth Rogo (1983) who
were the rst to show that macro models of exchange rate determination could not
beat the RW in predicting exchange rates. On the other hand, Eugene F. Fama
(1984) showed that high interest rate currencies tend to subsequently appreciate.
This is known as the forward discount puzzle and stands in contrast to Uncovered
Interest Parity (UIP), which says that a positive interest di erential should lead
to an expected depreciation of equal magnitude.
The RW hypothesis and the forward discount puzzle are not as contradictory as
it seems since the predictability of exchange rate changes by interest di erentials is
limited. For example, Fama (1984) reports an average R2 of 0.01 when regressing
monthly exchange rate changes on beginning-of-period interest di erentials. In
this paper we investigate whether these two features of the data may in fact be
related. In particular, we ask whether the predictability of exchange rates by
interest di erentials naturally results when participants in the FX market adopt
RW expectations.
RW expectations in the FX market are quite common, in particular when using
carry trade strategies, i.e. investing in high interest rate currencies and neglecting
potential exchange rate movements. These strategies typically deliver signi cant
excess returns (see Carlos Bazan et al. (2006), Craig Burnside et al. (2006), or
Miguel Villanueva (2006) for recent evidence). Moreover, many observers argue
that recent movements among major currencies are actually caused by carry trade
strategies. The adoption of RW expectations may also be rational. Welfare gains
that can be achieved from full information processing are likely to be small because
the R2 from exchange rate predictability regressions is so small. This needs to be
weighed against the cost of full information processing.
It is sometimes argued informally that purchases of high interest rate currencies should lead to their appreciation. If correct, that would imply that trade
based on RW expectations could indeed lead to the observed predictability of exchange rate changes by interest rates. However, we show that this simple intuition
1

is misleading. With frequent trading based on RW expectations, we nd that
high interest rate currencies depreciate much more than what UIP would predict.
However, when agents make infrequent FX portfolio decisions, we nd that high
interest rate currencies do indeed appreciate when investors adopt RW expectations. Thus, RW expectations can explain the forward premium puzzle, but only
if FX portfolio positions are revised infrequently.
This paper is closely related to Philippe Bacchetta and Eric van Wincoop
(2006). We argue in that paper that less than 1% of global FX positions are actively managed. We therefore consider a model in which agents make infrequent
FX portfolio decisions. We show that the welfare cost from making infrequent
portfolio decisions is very small, especially in comparison with observed FX management fees. We also show that when agents make infrequent decisions about FX
positions, high interest rate currencies tend to appreciate. This is particularly the
case when agents process only partial information. In this paper we consider the
particular case of partial information processing whereby agents simply adopt RW
expectations. Apart from being realistic, the simple case of RW expectations also
has the advantage that it leads to some precise analytical results.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we examine the
impact of frequent portfolio adjustment based on random walk expectations. In
Section 3 we present the model with infrequent decision making when the forward
discount (interest di erential) follows an autoregressive process. We particularly
focus on an AR(1) process, for which precise analytical results can be obtained.
In section 4 we take the general form of the model to the data and show that it
can account for the forward discount puzzle only when investors make infrequent
portfolio decisions. Section 5 concludes. Some technical details are derived in the
Appendix.

2

Frequent Decision Making

In this section, we present a simple model assuming that all investors make portfolio
decisions each period and expect the exchange rate to follow a RW. We focus on
the implications for the Fama regression st+1 st = 0 + f dt + et . Here st = ln St
is the log exchange rate and f dt is the forward discount. We show that frequent
FX trading implies a positive and large Fama regression coe cient , i.e., a bias
2

opposite to the empirical evidence.
There are two countries, Home and Foreign. There is a single good with the
same price in both countries, so that investors in each country face the same real
return and make the same portfolio decisions. Agents can invest in nominal bonds
of both countries. Asset returns, measured in the Home currency, are respectively
eit and eit +st+1 st for Home and Foreign bonds. Here it and it are the log of
one plus the nominal interest rates in Home and Foreign currencies. The forward
discount is then f dt = it it : Real returns are assumed to be constant, which for
simplicity we normalize at 0, as a result of a risk-free technology that investors
also have access to.
There are overlapping generations of investors who live for two periods. They
receive an endowment of the good when born that is worth one unit of the Home
currency, invest it and consume the return the next period. Agents born at time

) subject to Ct+1 = 1 +
t maximize expected period t + 1 utility Et Ct+1
qt+1
bt (e
1); where bt is the investment in Foreign bonds measured in terms of
Home currency and qt+1 = st+1 st + it it is the log excess return on Foreign
bonds from t to t + 1. The solution of this optimization is
bt = b +

Et qt+1

(1)

2

where b is a constant that depends on second moments and 2 = vart (qt+1 ) will be
constant over time in equilibrium. Since we adopt a two-country model we assume
that the steady-state supply of Foreign bonds is equal to half of total steady-state
nancial wealth. Assuming that the Foreign bond supply is xed in terms of the
Foreign currency, the log-linearized supply of Foreign bonds measured in the Home
currency is 0:5st . Here both the supply and st are in deviation from their steady
state. The Foreign bond market equilibrium condition in deviation from steady
state then becomes
Et qt+1
= 0:5st
(2)
2
The assumption of RW expectations implies that Et st+1 = st , so that Et qt+1 =
f dt . The one-period change in the equilibrium exchange rate is then
st+1

st =

(f dt+1

so that the Fama regression coe cient is:

where is the rst-order autocorrelation coe cient of the forward discount. Since
< 1 if f dt is stationary, is positive so that the Fama regression has the wrong
sign. The exchange rate is expected to depreciate, rather than appreciate as in
the data, when the forward discount rises. Moreover, the Fama coe cient tends
to be substantially larger than 1. For quarterly data discussed in section 4, and
are about 0.05 and 0.8. Even when we set = 10 the implied Fama coe cient
is = 16.
The intuition for the wrong sign of the Fama coe cient comes from the stationarity of the forward discount or interest rate di erential. Stationarity implies
that when the interest di erential i i is high today, on average it tends to fall
the next period. This reduces demand for the Home currency next period, leading
to its depreciation. High interest rate currencies therefore tend to depreciate.

3

Infrequent Portfolio Adjustment

In this section, we present the model where investors make infrequent portfolio
decisions. There are still overlapping generations of agents, but they now live
T + 1 periods and make only one portfolio decision for T periods. Otherwise the
model is the same as in Section 2, which corresponds to the case T = 1. The
crucial aspect is that portfolio holdings do not all respond to current information
on interest rates. At any point in time there are T generations of investors, only
one of which makes a new portfolio decision. Information is therefore transmitted
gradually into portfolio decisions and thus into prices. This corresponds to the
fact that most FX positions are not actively managed.
Investors born at time t invest bt in Foreign bonds, measured in the Home
currency. They hold this Foreign bond investment constant for T periods. Any
positive or negative return on wealth leads holdings of the Home bond or the riskfree technology to adjust accordingly. An agent born at time t, starting with a
P
wealth of one, accumulates a real wealth of 1 + bt Ti=1 (eqt+i 1) at t + T , which
is consumed at that time. End-of-life utility is the same as before. The optimal
4

portfolio of investors born at time t is then
Et qt;t+T
vart (qt;t+T )

bt = b +

(4)

where qt;t+T = qt+1 + ::: + qt+T is the cumulative excess return on Foreign bonds
from t to t + T .
The Foreign bond market equilibrium clearing condition (in deviation from
steady state) then becomes

j=1

T

j+1 qt j+1;t j+1+T

T

= 0:5st

(5)

where T2 = vart (qt;t+T ) is constant over time in equilibrium. This equates the
average holdings of the Foreign bond over the T generations alive to the per capita
Foreign bond supply.
PT
Now adopt RW expectations, so that Et qt;t+T =
k=1 Et f dt+k 1 . Since investors have a multi-period horizon, we need to make an assumption about the
statistical process of the forward discount. We assume that it follows an AR(p)
P
P
process. This implies parameters i such that Tk=1 Et f dt+k 1 = pi=1 i f dt+1 i .
The one-period change in the equilibrium exchange rate is

The Fama regression of st+1

T

p

i( i 2

T i=1

T +i 2 )

(7)

where j = corr(f dt ; f dt j ) and j = j . It is clear that when T gets large, T +i 2
tends toward zero when the forward discount is a stationary process. Therefore
the Fama coe cient becomes negative for T large enough, assuming positive autocorrelations and positive i .
A nice illustration of this is the special case of an AR(1) process. Then p = 1
and 1 = 1 + + ::: + T 1 , where is the autoregressive coe cient. The Fama
regression coe cient becomes

(8)

The coe cient is positive for T = 1 (as shown in the previous section), zero for
T = 2 and then turns negative for T > 2. The model can therefore account for the
negative Fama coe cient in the data as long as agents make infrequent portfolio
decisions. This is a result of delayed overshooting. When the Foreign interest
rate falls (and therefore the forward discount rises), investors shift from Foreign to
Home bonds and the Home currency appreciates. This continues for T periods as
new generations continue to adjust their portfolio from Foreign to Home bonds due
to the lower Foreign interest rate. Only after T periods is this process reversed.
Investors start buying Foreign bonds again and the Home currency depreciates.
The reason is that the Foreign interest rate has increased by then and investors
who sold Foreign bonds T periods earlier are due to make a new portfolio decision.
The continued appreciation for T periods after the increase in the forward discount
gives rise to a negative Fama coe cient.
When T approaches in nity the Fama coe cient goes to zero. This implies
that there is an intermediate value of T for which the Fama coe cient is most
negative. When T is large the exchange rate response to interest rate shocks is
small since only a small fraction of agents makes active portfolio decisions at any
point in time. Both the initial appreciation and the subsequent appreciation for T
periods are then small.

Quantitative Illustration

We now quantify the Fama coe cient implied by the above model by estimating an
autoregressive process for the forward discount. Moreover, we extend the model
to allow for noise or liquidity traders. In the above model exchange rates are
completely driven by interest rate shocks. It is well known though that interest rate
shocks, or other observed macro fundamentals, account for only a small fraction of
exchange rate volatility in the data. Therefore, instead of a per capita Foreign bond
supply of 0.5 (in Foreign currency), we assume that it is 0:5Xt , where Xt represents
shocks to net demand or supply associated with liquidity or noise traders. We
assume that xt = ln(Xt ) follows a random walk with innovation xt at time t that
is N (0; x2 ) distributed. The only change to the expression (6) for st+1 st is that
x
t+1 is added on the right hand side. The expression for the Fama coe cient
is unchanged. But the noise trade does a ect the conditional variance T2 of the
6

excess return that shows up in the expression for the Fama coe cient. Moreover,
since the noise shocks are uncorrelated with interest rate shocks, they lower the
R2 of the Fama regression.
We estimate autoregressive processes for the forward discount using monthly
data on 3-month interest rates for six currencies from December 1978 to December
2005. The currencies are the U.S. dollar, Deutsche mark-euro, British pound,
Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc. The forward discount is equal
to the U.S. interest rate minus the interest rate on one of the other currencies.
Interest rates are 3-month rates quoted in the London Euromarket and obtained
from Datastream. We use the simple average of the autoregressive coe cients and
standard deviations of innovations estimated for the ve forward discount series.
While we have computed results for p ranging from 1 to 5, for space considerations
we only report results for an AR(3) process. Results are similar for other values
of p.
We set = 10 (see Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2006) for a discussion). Figure
1 reports results for the Fama regression coe cient, the R2 of the Fama regression, the autocorrelation of quarterly log exchange rate changes and the standard
deviation of the quarterly log exchange rate change, with T ranging from 1 to 15.
Results are reported both for x = 0 (previous section) and x = 0:04. Results
can be compared to the data, which yield an average Fama coe cient of -1.6, average R2 of 0.04, average rst-order autocorrelation of 0.055 and average quarterly
standard deviation of 5.4%.
The model does well in accounting for the negative Fama coe cient. For x =
0:04 the Fama coe cient remains close to -2 for T 3. For x = 0 it is even slightly
more negative. When x = 0:04, the R2 of the Fama regression is always less than
0.06 and less than 0.02 for T
4. For x = 0 it is less than 0.04 for T
4 but
gets much larger for higher values of T . The autocorrelation of quarterly changes
in exchange rates is also small, less than 0.03 for both values of x . These results
indicate that the exchange rate behaves similar to a RW, with future exchange rate
changes hard to predict by the forward discount and past exchange rate changes.
The standard deviation of the quarterly log change in the exchange rate drops as
T rises, which weakens the portfolio response to interest rates. It becomes broadly
consistent with the data for T 4.
To summarize, when T > 1 (infrequent portfolio decision making) the model
7

can account for a wide range of evidence about exchange rates, including the
negative Fama coe cient as well as the near-RW behavior of the exchange rate.
For example, when T = 4 the Fama regression coe cients are -1.6 and -1.4 for x
respectively 0 and 0.04. The R2 is respectively 0.04 and 0.02. The autocorrelations
of quarterly exchange rate changes are respectively 0.03 and 0.02 and the standard
deviations of quarterly exchange rate changes are 4.8% and 5.8%. These are all
close to the data.

Conclusion

We have shown that even when the exchange rate is close to a RW, and investors
therefore sensibly adopt RW expectations, exchange rate changes can be negatively
predicted by the forward discount with a coe cient that is in line with the Fama or
forward discount puzzle. This happens when investors make infrequent decisions
about FX positions.

Forward discount autocorrelations and variance

The Fama coe cient is expressed in terms autocorrelations. j is the autocorrelation of order j ( j = corr(f dt ; f dt j )). It has the property that j = j so that
j = abs( j) . These autocorrelations can be computed by using the Yule-Walker
equations. Using the AR process for f dt we get:
