Inside Money and Monetary Neutrality

ABSTRACT

This paper examines the interaction between the financial and real sectors of
the economy within the framework of a stochastic, rational expectation model that
distinguishes between inside and outside money. The model also can be used to
study the impact of variations in the degree of intermediation, measured by the
elasticity of bank deposit supply. In contrast to earlier work which emphasized

confusion between monetary and real shocks, we focus on the role played by
confusion between inside and outside money and temporary and permanent base
money disturbances. Financial sector disturbances, as well as temporary shocks to
the monetary base, are shown to have real effects even when private agents have
When contemporaneous information on economic
complete information.
disturbances is incomplete, permanent shocks to the monetary base also have real
effects. If our model is correct, it is invalid to reject equilibrium models of the
business cycle on the grounds that anticipated money affects output. We argue that
this result is robust in the sense that many reasonable" models which incorporate
inside money would yield a non-neutrality of portfolio and temporary base money
supply shocks.

Recent trends towards the deregulation of the financial services industry have

generated a growing literature on the role of monetary policy in an unregulated
financial environment. The works of Black [1970], Fama [1980], Wallace [1983], and

Bryant and Wallace [1984] have focused on the role of legal restrictions and regulations in determining the effectiveness of monetary policy. Less emphasized, but of

equal importance in recent years, is the impact of technological innovations that
affect the ability of financial institutions to intermediate between borrowers and
lenders. Many of these same issues were also the subject of a large literature that

developed in the early 1960's. For example, Gurley and Shaw [1960], Tobin and

Brainard [19631 and Patinkin [1961, 19651 analyzed the role of financial
intermediaries in general equilibrium models. This earlier literature employed
static, deterministic models -- models which cannot be used to study the effects of

expectations and imperfect information that have been emphasized in recent work
on business cycles (Lucas [1975], Barro (1981]).

The purpose of the present paper is to examine the interaction between the

financial and real sectors of an economy within the framework of a stochastic,
rational expectation model that distinguishes between inside and outside money.

The model also allows the impact of variations in the degree of intermediation,

measured by the elasticity of bank deposit supply, to be studied. In contrast to
earlier work that has emphasized the role of confusion between monetary and real
shocks, the model developed in the present paper can also examine the role played by

a confusion between inside and outside money disturbances. Even when private

agents have complete information, financial sector disturbances, as well as
temporary shocks to the monetary base, are shown to have real effects. When
contemporaneous information on economic disturbances is incomplete, permanent
base money shocks also have real effects.

2

The model we develop helps to provide an understanding of recent empirical

work that distinguishes between unperceived and unanticipated monetary shocks
(Boschen and Grossman [1982]) and recent work on the real interest rate effects of
money announcements (Roley and Walsh [1985]). In particular, our model does not

imply that output movements should be uncorrelated with known money supply
changes (or noisy signals of such changes) unless agents also know whether those
changes are permanent or temporary. In the latter case, known permanent changes

in base money would be neutral. But, known temporary changes in base money
would not be. This result contrasts with models such as that of Brunner, Cukierman,

and Meltzer [19801 which incorporate only outside money and find that both
temporary and permanent changes in money are neutral. Regression resUlts which

reject equilibrium models of the business cycle on the grounds that anticipated
money affects output are invalid if our model is correct. In fact, we argue that the

specific details of our model are not required to make such tests invalid. Many
t'reasonable" models which incorporate inside money would yield a non-neutrality of
portfolio and temporary base money supply shocks.

The paper is organized as follows. Section II develops a simple model of the
financial sector and carries out some comparative static exercises. These help to fix

the intuition on how interest rates adjust to financial shocks.

Section III

incorporates the goods market and examines general equilibrium with complete
information. The case in which full, current information is unavailable is studied in

Section IV. In order to motivate the emphasis we place on the distinction between
inside money and outside money, the next section presents some simple empirical
evidence that suggests these two types of money may have independent and distinct
roles in macroeconomic fluctuations.

I.

Empirical Background
Summary statistics for two measures of outside money -- the monetary base

and currency -- and two measures of inside money -- Ml and M2, both excluding
currency -- are presented in Table 1. Monthly data are used for the period January

1960 to September 1985. Because of the shift in Federal Reserve operating
procedures in October, 1979, Table 1A presents means, standard deviations, and
sample autocorrelations for the period January 1960 to September 1979, while those
for the period January 1980 to September 1985 are presented in Table lB.

An examination of the means and standard deviations show them to be
generally similar for both inside and outside money. However, the autocorrelations
show somewhat different patterns. This suggests that the distinction between inside
money and outside money is a meaningful one; the two types of money display quite

different time series behavior. In fact, the correlation between the monetary base
and M2 excluding currency was only 0.31 in the pre-October 1979 period and 0.21 in
the 1980:01-1985:09 period.

To examine whether inside and outside money display different correlations
with other macroeconomic variables, a five variable VAR system was estimated over

the 1960:01-1979:09 period. The variables included were the logs of real personal
income (Y), the price deflator for personal income (P), M2, the monetary base (B),

and, in level form, the 3-month Treasury bill interest rate (R). Table 2 presents the
marginal significance levels for tests of Granger causality and the correlation matrix

of the contemporaneous residuals. In each case, the null hypothesis is that the row
variable does not cause the column variable.

Several interesting results emerge from Table 2. First, M2, the inside measure
of money, apears to Granger causes Y, while the base does not appear to. However,

the residuals from the equation for the base are more highly correlated with the
contemporaneous income residuals than are the M2 residuals. Conversely, the base

4

Granger causes P but M2 does not. Table 2 also shows that the base does not
Granger cause M2, but M2 Granger causes the base. This last finding is hardly
surprising since the Federal Reserve has never adopted a policy of controlling the
monetary base.

Table 2 strongly suggests that inside money and outside money have very
different correlations with other macroeconomic variables. There is no evidence to
support the view that it is sufficient to consider only one monetary aggregate, a view
implicit in almost all current macroeconomic models.

Further evidence against this standard view is found in Table 3 which uses the
estimated VAR to construct a variance decomposition. The ordering of the variables

was Y, P, R, M2 and B. Other orderings were tried, with little effect on the general
results -- those in Table 3 are quite representative. Even though it appears last in

the ordering, the base explains a much higher fraction of the forecast error variance

of Y and P than does M2. However, the base accounts for little of the M2 forecast
error variance.
This brief examination of the data indicates that inside and outside money bear

different relationships to basic macroeconomic variables. This conclusion is
consistent with the work of King and Plosser [1984) who also find inside and outside

money to exhibit different correlations with income and prices. This suggests that,

particularly for empirical work, it may be important to distinguish between inside

and outside money. A theoretical framework for evaluating the different roles
played by central bank liabilities and private bank liabilities is developed in the
next two sections.

II. The Financial Sector
Financial institutions, banks for short, are assumed to intermediate between
firms and households. Firms directly hold the economy's stock of physical capital,

while households, the economy's ultimate wealthholders, hold claims against both

the financial intermediaries and the central bank. The financial structure can be
seen by considering the simplified balance sheets of each sector. The value of capital

held by firms is balanced by their liabilities in the form of loans from banks. Banks

hold loans and reserves as assets, and issue liabilities in the form of deposits.
Household's hold deposits and currency, balanced on the liability side by their net

worth. Finally, currency plus reserves are the liabilities of the central bank. The

model thus incorporates four financial assets: loans, deposits, reserves, and
currency. The remainder of this section sets out a simple model of the financial
sector, and examines some of the properties of financial sector equilibrium. The next

section expands the model to endogenize price expectations and to allow real output
to respond to real interest rates.

The banking industry is assumed to be competitive; each individual bank
maximizes profits, taking interest rates on loans and deposits as given. The profits
of a representative bank are equal to interest income from loans minus interest paid

on deposits minus real costs associated with providing loans and deposits. In
addition, banks hold currency to meet legal reserve requirements imposed by the
monetary authority. If excess reserves are zero, and the required reserve ratio is p,
the bank's budget constraint implies that its loans in period t are equal to (1 where Dt equals its deposit liabilities. Hence, real bank profits can be written as
[i(1 —p) —

where i is the nominal interest rate on loans, r is the nominal rate paid on deposits,

and c(S) is the bank's convex cost function. The first order condition for profit

9

maximization' by a "representative bank" implies that
=

c'/P)

(2.1)

Now let i and rt denote actual deviations of interest rates about their
(known) trend levels, and dt and Pt proportional deviations of deposits and the price
level about their (known) trends. Equation (2.1) can then be approximated by
d—p

= t [i(1_p) — r] + u,

(2.2)

where we have appended a banking sector deposit supply shock Ut. The parameter t

in (2.2) equals 1 / c rD/P)e, where D and P are the trend values of D and P, and e is the
elasticity of c' (). This parameter will play a key role in the subsequent analysis
and will serve as an index of the degree of financial intermediation. As e —+ o (t —
the supply of deposits becomes perfectly elastic. This is the case considered by Fama

[19801, Fischer [1983], and Romer [1985] in their analyses of unregulated financial

sectors. We can interpret (2.2) as implying that so long as banks incur non-constant
marginal costs in transforming deposits into loans, a positive spread between i (1 - p)

and r is required. In the limit as t — , a positive spread between i and r exists
only if p>O.
From the balance sheet constraint, the representative bank's nominal supply of
loans is just (1-p)Dt. In terms of proportional deviations about trend,

1—P (d_p) t[i(l _p)._r] + u,

(2.3)

where l is the proportional deviation of nominal loans about trend and use has been
made of(2.2).

The demand for loans is a derived demand arising from the investment demand

by firms for physical capital. Assuming the demand for capital is a decreasing
function of the expected real interest rate on loans, it + Pt -Etp÷j, the real demand

11)

for loans will be written as
(2.4)

_3(i+ p_Ep 1)+c

with a real loan demand shock (or equivalently, a shock to desired investment).
Using (2.3) and (2.4), the nominal loan rate that clears the loan market is
.—p))

Equation (2.5) shows that as t —, the loan rate approaches a constant markup over

the deposit interest rate, with the markup factor equal to (i-p)'. For t finite, the

spread between the loan and deposit rates will depend on the expected rate of
inflation and the two disturbances Ct and Ut.

To complete the financial sector, it is necessary to specify household demands
for deposits and currency. We follow standard specifications:
—

Pt

=

— qJr —

(2.6)

=

y+Yr+kw

(2.7)

where c is the proportional deviation of household currency holdings about trend, yt
is the proportional deviation of income about trend, and wt is a portfolio disturbance

that affects household demand for deposits relative to currency. For convenience,

the income elasticities of demand for currency and deposits are set equal to one.
Also, both theoretical (see, for example, Hartley [1985] ) and empirical analyses
(Goldfeld [1973]) suggest that the semi-elasticity of currency demand with respect to

interest paid on deposits (w) is lower (in absolute value) than the semi-elasticity of

demand for deposits (y).2 The factor k = C I D (with C trend currency holdings)
arises in (2.7) since the left hand sides in (2.6) and (2.7) a?e expressed in terms of
proportional deviations about trend. For U.S. data, k has been roughly 0.4 in the last

11

decade, although it is much closer to 1.0 if we restrict ourselves to household money

holdings alone. On the other hand, if we think of d as representing a wider range of

assets (including time deposits, saving and loan deposits, mutual funds and even
insurance policies and pension funds), k would be much smaller.

Deposit market equilibrium requires that deposit supply given by (2.2) equal
deposit demand given by (2.7). This condition can be written
(2.8)

This relationship defines a locus in (i, r) space consistent with deposit market
equilibrium for given y, w, and u. This locus has slope

restores equilibrium by increasing banks' desired supply of deposits.

12

Equilibrium in the financial sector also requires that currency demand, both by

households and by banks via their demand for reserves, equal the monetary
authority's supply of high-powered money. The equilibrium condition for currency
can be written

6c+

(1

—6) d = m

(2.9)

where mt is the proportional deviation of high-powered money about a deterministic

trend and 8 is the ratio of trend currency in the hands of the nonbank public to total

trend high-powered money. For later purposes, it is useful to note that p6=k(1-8).
In later sections of the paper, it will be assumed that we can write

m=

+

(2.10)

where Ut iS a white noise shock to mt and E Xt..j is a random walk with innovation x.

Thus, x represents a permanent shock to the base money supply, while Ut iS a
transitory shock.3

Combining (2.6) and (2.7) with (2.9), the reserve market equilibrium condition
can be written as
—

where = 8ii - (l-6)y.

4r = m —y + 6(l—p)w

(2.11)

The parameter 4 is the interest semi-elasticity of the excess

supply of high-powered money. A rise in r reduces the demand for currency, and this

increases the excess supply of high-powered money. However, a rise in r also
increases deposit demand and banks' demand for reserves. We will assume that the
net effect of a rise in r is a reduction in the demand for high-powered money: 4 > 0.

Substituting (2.7) into (2.4) and using (2.11) to eliminate pt the condition for
equilibrium in the loans market can be written as

13

—— (y+)r =

+

_Ep1 + [k +

—

(2.12)

This defines a locus with slope di/dr = -(y+J34) / f < 0 in (i, r) space. This locus is
labeled LL in Figure 1. A rise in i reduces loan demand and creates excess supply in

the loan market. A fall in r is required to reduce deposit demand and cause loan
supply to decline.

Figure 1 can be used to examine the effects of various disturbances to the
financial markets, holding Yt and Et Pt +1 constant. A rise in mt shifts the LL locus
down but does not directly affect the DD locus. Both nominal interest rates fall, but,
since the slope of DD exceeds one, the loan rate decreases more than the deposit rate.

Thus, the spread between loan and deposit rates falls in response to a monetary
expansion. Using (2.11), it can be shown that Pt rises.

A positive shock to deposit supply (Ut > 0) leaves LL unaffected, but shifts DD

to the right. The deposit rate rises and the loan rate declines. Again, the spread

between loan and deposit rates declines.

Equation (2.11) can, with some

manipulation, be used to show that p rises.

A positive portfolio shift disturbance w shifts the LL curve down and the DD
curve to the left. The deposit rate falls, but the effect on i is ambiguous. A positive w

increases the demand for deposits relative to currency. This tends to reduce r and
induce banks to increase their supply of loans, causing ito fall. However, the initial
fall in the demand for currency is also offset by the fall in r. If the offset is more than

complete, the price level could fall. Given Etp±i, such a fall in Pt increases the

expected rate of inflation and reduces the real rate of interest on loans. If the
resulting rise in loan demand is larger than the rise in loan supply induced by the

fall in r, the nominal loan rate could rise. Sufficient conditions to insure that a
portfolio shift out of currency reduces both interest rates and leads to a rise in the

11

price level

are that either y >k or t

The first condition, which implies that

a rise in the interest rate paid on deposits raises the demand for currency plas
deposits, follows from y>q and k<1. The second just requires that the degree of
financial intermediation not be 'ttoo small." Either condition is sufficient to insure
that both rates decline in response to a positive w.
A positive shock to loan demand (Ct >0) shifts the LL curve up. Both nominal

interest rates rise, and, because the slope of DD is greater than 1, the spread between
loan and deposit rates rises. Using (2.11), the price level can be shown to rise.

A positive income shock shifts both curves. The direction of the shift in LL is

ambiguous unless we can sign 1-!. This ambiguity arises because an increase in
income increases deposit demand for each r. This increase in the demand for the

banks' liabilities allows banks to increase loan supply. On the other hand, in the
high-powered money market, the rise in y for given r,requires a fall in p to maintain

market equilibrium. The fall in p reduces the ex ante real loan rate and increases
loan demand by 3 times the rise in y. If f3> 1, this second channel dominates and a
higher i is required to clear the loan market: LL shifts up. The DD locus shifts up as
well since the demand for deposits has risen. Thus, f3 > 1 is sufficient to insure that

the loan rate increases. However, an additional condition is required to sign the
effect on r. It can be shown that if t is sufficiently large, r will also rise. Using (2.11),

it can be shown that p must unambiguously fall in response to a positive supply
shock. These results are summarized in Table 4.

An increase in the degree of financial intermediation is represented by an
increase in u. As equation (2.12) shows, the LL locus is independent oft, but, from
(2.8), a rise in t shifts DD to the right. The loan rate falls and the deposit rate rises.

Hence, the gains to more efficient intermediation accrue to both borrowers and
lenders. Since the spread (i-p) i-r falls as t increases, the equilibrium real quantities
of both loans and deposits are increasing in t.

b. Sufficient conditions to obtain this sign are f>1 and t > 131[(13-1)(1-p)].
c.

Sufficent condition to obtain this sign is 3> 1.

As the degree of financial intermediation goes to infinity, (1-p)i-r converges to zero
and the equilibrium loan rate is given by

= {C+

—)y—(P6(1 —p)+k)w}/U3+(1 p)(y +p

(2.14)

It is interesting to note that the reserve ratio appears only in the denominator,

multiplied by y + >0, and in the coefficient on the portfolio shock, Wt. If neither
currency nor deposit holdings by households are interest sensitive (qr =y = 0), then
y + !4 =0 and the expected value of i is independent of p. Consequently, the

expected reserve tax is borne completely by deposit holders. If either qr or y are non-

zero, then the banks' borrowers also bear part of the tax.5 Even when ii y = 0, the
variance of i will depend on p since the coefficient of wt becomes 6(l-p). Thus, the

reserve requirement tends to dampen the effect on the loan rate of shifts between
deposits and currency.

With costless intermediation, r approaches i as the reserve requirement goes to

zero. If p—O and t—, equation (2.14) shows that it becomes less sensitive to all
disturbances with the possible exception of w.

The analysis of this section has taken as given the level of income and the
expected future price level, using the three asset market equilibrium conditions,
(2.5), (2.8), and (2.11), to solve for the two interest rates and the price level.6 The
complete rational expectations solution requires the specification of the information

structure and an assumption concerning aggregate supply in the goods market.
These are discussed in the next section.

III.

General Equilibrium with Complete Information
In this section we allow Yt and Et Pt+ 1 to respond endogenously to the interest

rate and price movements produced by the c, w, u, v and x shocks. Specifically, in
line with other equilibrium models of the business cycle, we assume intertemporal

substitution by households makes current output a positive function of the real
interest rate available to households:
(3.1)

where t is an exogenous supply shock. Also in line with virtually all other
macroeconomic models, we ignore the effect on aggregate supply arising through

effects of(it+p-Ep+i) on investment and hence the capital stock. We adopt this
specification in order to focus on the consequences of including inside money in a

model which is in other respects very similar to models previously analyzed. The
dynamics introduced by accounting for capital accumulation would complicate the
solution of the model and obscure the interpretation of the main results.

The equilibrium conditions for the loan, deposit, and reserve markets can now
be written:

Using (3.8) we can solve for the rlij'S in (3.5) - (3.7). The algebraic expressions

are given in Appendix 1, while numerical values corresponding to plausible values

for a, j3, y, qr, K, 6 and t are presented in the next section. In that section, we also

discuss the sensitivity of the solution to changes in the parameter values. In the
remainder of this section we shall investigate the qualitative results by comparing
the solution to (3.8) with the solution discussed in Section II.

The signs of the partial derivatives of each of the endogenous variables with
respect to each of the shocks (i.e., the signs of the njj coefficients in (3.5) - (3.7) ) are

presented in Table 5 (corresponding to Table 4 in Section II). The main change from

Section II is that the effects on Pt of a banking sector shock (Ut) and a loan demand

shock (Ct) change sign (to become negative). The reason for this is that nominal
income is the factor determining asset demands. Hence, while the effect of shocks on

nominal income Pt + yt, does not change from Section II to Section III, the effect on

prices can differ when real output is allowed to move. Otherwise, the signs of the

effects of the shocks on the endogenous variables are similar to those found in
Section II. For the signs which are ambiguous, the conditions on parameter values

20

which would remove the ambiguity are also similar to those presented and discussed
in Section II.

We demonstrate in Appendix 1 that real output responds positively to all

shocks. This result does not depend on assumptions with respect to relative
parameter values except for yt / awt, in which case y>kqr+k / 6 is sufficent to
ensure ayt / dwt > 0.

In particular, financial sector shocks w, Ut, and v are non-neutral even when
there is no uncertainty about the source of shocks. A positive base supply shock Vt

raises the current price level relative to the expected future price level. This more
than offsets the fall in the nominal deposit rate, raising the anticipated real interest

rate faced by households, and leading to a rise in output. Thus, known temporary
innovations in the money base, Vt, have real effects. They cannot merely produce
offsetting price and nominal interest rate movements because of the operation of the

21

banking sector. More explicitly, if temporary base money innovations are not to
have real effects, from (3.1) they must not alter the real interest rate (r+pt-Ep+ i).
But equilibrium between the demand and supply of base money (3.4) requires rt and

Pt to move to increase the demand for currency. The two conditions (rt + PtEtpt + i) = 0 and (pt-Etpt + i-4rt) = 1 then completely determine the effect of vt on rt
and pt. Turning to (3.2) and (3.3), equilibrium in the markets for deposits and loans

then imposes two further conditions while introducing only one additional variable

t• In general, this will yield an inconsistency, leading us to reject the hypothesis

(rt+pt-Ept+i)=0. In short, if temporary base money shocks are not to have real

effects, deposit rates rt and prices Pt have to move equal non-zero amounts in
opposite directions. But changes in rt alter the demand for deposits. Any movement

in the loan interest rate, i, which would restore equilibrium to the deposit market
would cause disequilibrium in the loan market (holding rt and Pt fixed).

By contrast, note that a permanent innovation in base money, xt, produces a
proportional movement in current and all future prices while leaving interest rates
and output unaffected.

Our results on the differing impact of temporary and permanent base money
supply shocks can be contrasted with the remarks of Barro [1981, p.5 1]:

One conclusion from these models with endogenous

nominal interest rates is that the stress on confusions between

temporary and permanent monetary shocks has been

overdone. The real effects of temporary, but perceived, money
shocks would be eliminated by the appropriate adjustment in
the nominal rate of return....

We cannot have offsetting price and interest rate movements in our model (and
thereby avoid real effects), because the demand for deposits and hence the supply of
loans would be affected. One or both real interst rates must be affected by temporary
money supply shocks. In our model they are both affected.

22

There are some modifications of our model which would cause all base money

innovations to be neutral. For example, suppose monetary injections take the form
of transfers proportional to each individual's or branch's existing base holdings as in
Lucas [1972]. In this case, base money innovations have no effect on the opportunity

cost of holding base money. Household's demands for deposits and currency would

then depend on real rather than nominal interest rates. Banks' supply of deposits
would similarly be a function of the difference between the real loan interest rate,

adjusted for the reserve ratio, minus the real deposit rate. Both temporary and
permanent base money shocks would then be neutral. However, empirical tests of
monetary neutrality have not been based on data generated by economies in which
money supply changes have taken the form of interest payments on existing money
holdings.

Portfolio shifts, w, and supply shocks originating in the banking sector, Ut, are

two sources of output movements in a model with inside money which, of course,
cannot be present in models which have just one (outside) monetary asset. A positive

innovation in wt increases the demand for bank deposits relative to currency,
producing an excess supply of high-powered money. This excess supply is eliminated

by a combination of a fall in r and a rise in p. For reasonable parameter values (i.e.,
y >kqi + k/6), this adjustment leads to a rise in the real deposit rate and, hence, a rise

in output. A positive u shock raises both the supply of loans and the supply of
deposits. This results in a rise in the real return on deposits and produces a rise in
output.
It is also worth noting that Ut, WI , and v1 shocks will in general all be reflected

in movements of money supply measures which include inside money, such as Ml.
In this model, deviations about trend of an aggregate like Ml are given by

23

Even if there is no uncertainty about the sources of shocks and the monetary base is
exogenous, the presence of inside money and temporary shocks to the base can easily

explain positive correlations between M1 and current output yt.

Looking at the implications of the model for co-movements between other
variables, it can be seen from the solution in Appendix 1 that (consistent with the
results of Section II) temporary base money and banking sector shocks decrease the
spread, i(1-p)-r, between the borrowing and lending rates of financial intermediaries.

On the other hand, real demand and supply shocks increase the spread between
borrowing and lending rates of interest. Also, while supply shocks unambiguously

decrease current prices and temporary innovations in the base money supply
unambiguously increase current prices, the effects of demand, financial sector, and
portfolio shocks on current prices are all ambiguous.

Real supply and investment (or loan demand) shocks produce real interest rate

movements which partially offset their initial effect on output. This result follows
because the effects of , ,, u and v shocks on real output are all bounded between
zero and one, as can easily be seen by considering a uniform innovation in ,

,u

and v. An equivalent movement in Ct and E, implies, from (3.2), that real interest

rates need not vary to maintain loan market equilibrium. But in that case, supply
and demand would adjust in proportion to the Ct (and E,) shock. This in turn would

produce a proportionate increase in demand for currency and bank deposits. The
consequent increase in demand for base money could be completely accommodated

by the vt shock (equation 3.4). The increased demand for bank deposits could be
accommodated by the deposit supply shock u (3.3). Given that a uniform increase in
Ct,

t, Ut, and v produces an equivalent increase in yt, and also given, from

Appendix 1 that each of these shocks has a positive impact on
effect of each shock on y is in fact bounded between zero and one.

it follows that the

24

Finally, it is of interest to note the effect of increasing the degree to which
intermediation is effective in preventing a spread between it and rt from arising. As
the supply of intermediation services becomes infinitely elastic, and borrowing

and lending rates net of the effect of reserve requirements cannot diverge. Hence,

the effects of Ut, w, and v on i (l-p) - rt will fall to zero. Banking supply
disturbances, Ut, in fact have no effects on any variables as

Temporary

innovations in base money supply and portfolio shifts both continue to affect prices

and real interest rates. As t—, we know that i and r have to move together. In fact,
from the algebraic expression for the full information solution given in the appendix,
we can see that as t—*, the effect of real shocks on both i and r will be positive (only if

f3> 1 for ) and the effect of w and v shocks on i and r both tend to zero. As for y, as

section has demonstrated that even within the framework of an

equilibrium, rational expectations model in which current information is complete,
portfolio shifts between currency and deposits, as well as temporary innovations in

the monetary base, will lead to real interest rate and output movements. These

25

effects depend importantly on the presence of real costs of intermediation. Since the

assumption of complete cotemporaneous information is very restrictive, the next

section studies the behavior of real interest rates and output when current
information is incomplete. Permanent innovations in base money will no longer be

neutral in this case, since they will be confused with temporary innovations and
portfolio shifts.

z6

IV. Incomplete Current Information
In this section of the paper we assume that, while agents know the lagged
values of all shocks, they do not have complete information on the sources of current

shocks. In order to model the rapid availability of monetary data, we assume that
noisy measures of the monetary base and the money multiplier are observed. Thus,

the public is assumed to know the current values of t, rt, and Pt and two noisy
measures (signals) of the monetary base and the money multiplier:
=

+ + nit

(4.1)

and

s=p+y+ Y_kWr x1_u+n2

(4.2)

with flit, fl2t white noise.7

There are two motivations for studying this example. First, while the models
examined in Section ifi result in real effects of "financial sector" (u, v and w) shocks,

known permanent movements, xt, in base money supply would still be neutral with

respect to real variables and result in proportional movements in all prices. The
model in this section will imply that current x shocks also will be non-neutral.8

The second motivation for introducing uncertainty about the source of current
shocks is the evidence, presented by Lucas [1973], Alberro [1981] and Kormendi and

Maguire [19841 among others, that the real effects of monetary disturbances depend

on the variance of monetary shocks. These results suggest that the incomplete
information signal processing model of business cycle disturbances pioneered by
Lucas [1972] has some merit. However, a major difference in the implications of our

model and that of Lucas [1972] and subsequent authors is that, because known
monetary sector disturbances are not neutral, current signals on such disturbances
(such as 4.1 and 4.2) also will not be neutral. More explicitly, insofar as 4.1 and 4.2

27

reveal information about current temporary movements in base money supply, or

portfolio or banking sector shocks, they will lead to real output movements. Thus

our model can reconcile the cross-sectional empirical evidence, favorable to the
'misperceived money shocks" view of business cycles, with the findings of Boschen

and Grossman [1982] and Barro and Hercowitz [1980] that money announcements

appear to be correlated with real output movements. It also is consistent with the
empirical evidence that money announcements affect real interest rates (Roley and
Walsh [1984]).

The equilibrium conditions are still given by (3.2) - (3.4). Now, however, in

forming their expectations of future prices, agents will have five sources of

'

information (it, rt, Pt and (4.1) and (4.2)) on the eight variables:

[t tW

ZL

We need to solve for Pt it and rt in terms of the underlying shocks (4.3) so that we

can determine the information provided to agents from observation of pt it and rt.

Under the informational assumptions of this section, all lagged values of x are
known. As in Section ifi, these shocks will merely affect nominal prices, leaving

interest rates and real variables unchanged. Note that the proportional effect of
lagged x's on s2t (the money multiplier signal) through their effect on p is offset by

their effect on the money base. In all equations, current x and v appear in the form

Vt + x. Agents have no basis for distinguishing the effects of contemporaneous x
from those of v. Hence, the conjectured solutions (4.4) - (4.7) include Vt + x with a
common coefficient.

In forming their expectations, Et pt+ 1 , agents will use (4.4) to obtain

The projection equation (4.9) yields normal equations

where

(4.10)

r=E[QQ].

r will be a nonlinear function of the n coefficients and the variance-covariance
matrix E = E [ Qt' at]. This makes the solution analytically intractable. However,
one important implication of the model is immediate. Permanent innovations in the
monetary base will no longer be neutral but will have effects on real output and real

interest rates. This follows since known temporary base money innovations have

real effects and, with incomplete information, permanent innovations will be
confused with temporary innovations. Similarly, perceived innovations to the
monetary signal will have real effects.

To solve the model, we specify some values for the elasticity parameters,

together with a variance-covariance matrix E. Solving the model for plausible

parameter values will help to determine whether portfolio disturbances and
temporary base shocks can have effects which are not just of theoretical interest but

are of potential empirical significance as well. So that we may fix some plausible
parameter values, note that a is a semi-elasticity of supply with respect to the real

deposit interest rate (since yt is the proportional variation in output) and is the
semi-elasticity of loan demand with respect to the real loan interest rate. If real
interest rates are on the order of 4 percent, values of a and J3 around 8.0 will yield

elasticities of 0.3. Similarly, y and i represent semi-elasticities of asset demands
with respect to nominal interest rates. As we noted in Section II of the paper, on the

basis of both theory and empirical evidence we would expect y to exceed i. The
estimates reported in Goldfeld [1973] suggest a value for y of about 5 and for w of
about 3. In summary, we used as our "base case" parameter values:

a=

= 8.0; a = 5.00;

= 3.0.

3 ()

Similarly, the parameter t represents a semi-elasticity of deposit supply with respect

to the interest differential adjusted for the reserve requirement. We set 't = 8.0 for
the "base case."

The value of 8, the share of currency in high-powered money, was set to 3/4 (its

approximate value in the U.S.), while k, the ratio of currency to bank deposits, was
set to 1/2 (also its approximate value in the U.S.). As we noted above, the value of p

is then determined by the identity

p=

k(1.0—6)/8

(so that in the United States p is approximately equal to 1/6 for banks). When we

think about "deposits" in our model as representing a wider range of assets than
demand deposits, both k and the corresponding value of p will be smaller, but the
value of 8 will be no different. Accordingly, we examined the effect on the numerical
solution of reducing k to a smaller value.

With the above "base case" parameter values, we will have the following values
for two of the expressions needed to sign effects in Table 5:

= 8w—[l.O—SIy = 1.0>0
= 7.0>0

To calculate the incomplete information solution, we also need to specify the

relative variances for the different shocks. Examination of the normal equation
(4.10) implies that the absolute values of the variances are irrelevant. We take the
variance of permanent money supply shocks, o2,, to be the smallest. Measured as a
ratio to cr2 the remaining variances were set at:

Table 6 presents the numerical solution for the "base case" parameter values.

Looking first at the full information solution, which was explicitly derived in the

Appendix and discussed in the previous section, it is of some interest to note the

magnitudes of the coefficients. Temporary base money supply shocks have the
largest effect on output, followed by portfolio shocks, output supply shocks, banking

sector shocks and, lastly, loan demand or investment shocks• e. A 5 percent
temporary deviation of base money about trend would, under full information and
given the "base" parameter values, result in a 3.1 percent deviation of output about

trend. Similarly, a 5 percent shift out of currency and into deposits would increase
output about 1.4 percent. Both of these shocks affect output positively because they

raise current prices,9 but reduce deposit and loan interest rates by lesser amounts.'°
Supply shocks significantly reduce prices and raise nominal interest rates by a lesser

amount, and thus increase output by less than the size of the shock. On the other
hand, while loan demand (or investment) shocks also decrease prices, they increase
deposit rates to a greater extent and so expand output.
When we compare the incomplete and full information solutions in Table 6, we

see the effect of the confusion between temporary and permanent shocks to the base

money supply produced by uncertainty. Temporary base money supply shocks now
have a larger effect on prices (a 5 percent shock leading to a 2.2 percent movement in

prices), but permanent shocks have a smaller effect, than under full information.
Similarly, the effect of both temporary and permanent base money supply shocks on

interest rates is between the effects of each shock under full information. A 5
percent temporary or permanent base money supply shock increases output roughly
2.2 percent above trend. If we look at the row of coefficients for Etp +1 (in effect, Etxt)

we see that a permanent base money supply shock is also confused to a significant
extent with a movement in base measurement error (ni), a positive portfolio shock,

and a negative supply shock. The confusion with base measurement error arises

since the measure of the base observed by individuals is x + v + flit. Confusion
with portfolio and negative supply shocks arises since these have an effect on prices

and interest rates that is similar to that of a temporary base supply shock. By
contrast, c and u shocks have a different effect on prices and interest rates and are

therefore confused less for money shocks. The effect of real and banking sector
shocks on output ends up being higher under incomplete than full information, while

the effect of temporary base money shocks and portfolio shocks is lower. Permanent
base money supply shocks of course have a larger effect on output under uncertainty

than when current information is complete. Finally, note that the correlation
between output movements and announced money base movements is a little over

33

0.66. Given that known temporary money base movements have a large effect on

output, it is not surprising that the present model also results in a large positive
correlation between money announcements and real output (and real interest rate)
movements when information is incomplete."
Table 7 illustrates the effects of varying some of the key parameter values. The

effect of each of the shocks on output is little changed from one set of parameter
values to the next. This remains true even when many of the parameters are varied

over quite a large range. Prices and interest rates can be noticeably affected by

parameter changes, but real output (a times real deposit interest rates) appears
much less sensitive.

The upper half of Table 7 illustrates the effects of increasing the elasticity of

deposit supply. These effects are consistent with the discussion of the previous
section on the full information solution. In both the full and incomplete information

cases, raising t increases the real effects of real shocks (c and ) and reduces the real
effects of monetary shocks.

In the lower half of Table 7 we reduced k from 0.5 to 0.2. This solution
corresponds to the assumption that D represents a broader range of assets than just
demand deposits. With D larger, both k (= C / D) and p (= reserves / D) will fall, but

8 (= C / M) will remain unchanged. The major consequence of reducing k (and the
corresponding value of p) is that the effect of portfolio shocks on deposit interest rates

is reduced. A given sized shock w represents a smaller increase in demand for inside

assets D, and hence produces less of a reduction in rt. The smaller fall in rt
translates into a larger rise in output.

Table 8 illustrates the effect of changing the relative variances of the shocks.

Comparing the top panel of Table 3 with Table 5, we can see that increasing the
variance of real (c and E) shocks relative to money shocks raises the real effect of

money disturbances on output in line with the results of previous rational
expectations equilibrium business cycle models (e.g., Lucas [1973], Barro [1976]).

The second panel of Table 8 shows the results when the variances ofportfolio

and banking sector shocks are also raised. Here, perhaps somewhat contrary to

previous models (which did not really include such shocks), the real effects of
portfolio and base money supply shocks continue to increase. The basic reason is

that the increase in cr2 and o2 relative to a2, reduces the extent to which
movements in endogenous variables are interpreted as the result of a permanent

base money supply shock x. Hence, Etpt+i is not as affected. This parallels the
result of reducing the relative variance of money shocks in earlier models. There,
the reduction in the variance of money relative to real shocks increases the extent to

which shocks are interpreted as real, and so reduces the effect of a money shock on

Etpt+i.
In the third panel of Table 8, the variance of temporary base money supply
shocks is also increased relative to permanent base money supply shocks. This
further increases the real effects of portfolio and base money shocks and lowers the

real effects of real and banking sector shocks (c, and u). The rise in o2 increases

the extent to which base money shocks are interpreted as temporary shocks and
therefore increases the real effect of such shocks.

Finally, the bottom panel of Table 8 also doubles the two noise variances
relative to cr2,. Thus, the bottom panel of Table 8 can equivalently be interpreted as

a halving of the variance of x shocks relative to all other variances in the model.
Comparing the bottom panel of Table 8 with Table 6, we see that a reduction in the

variance of permanent base money supply shocks relative to all other variances
increases the real effects of w, v and x shocks, and reduces the real effects ofc, and u

shocks. Movements in endogenous variables (and the measured base and money
multipliers) will be interpreted less as reflecting x shocks, and therefore actual x

37

shocks will have larger real effects. Comparing the final panel of Table 5 with the

third panel of Table 7, we see that raising the noise variances holding all other
variances constant increases the real effects of x and v shocks but red aces the real

effects of w shocks. This result appears to hold more generally.'2 An explanation
may be that as the variances of the noise terms rise we have two effects operating.

First, as the noise terms come to dominate both the base and multiplier measures,
and the endogenous price and nominal interest rate variables, the coefficients of all

shocks in Etpt+i would tend to fall toward zero. Second, the noise terms have
coefficients equal to or close to unity in the base and multiplier measures, but much

smaller coefficients in the endogenous price and interest rate variables. Hence, as
the noise variances increase, the weight of the endogenous variables in Etxt will tend

to rise, increasing the degree of confusion between w and x + v shocks. These two
effects might explain the non-monotonic behavior of the coefficient of w in Etpt+i as

the relative variances of the noise terms are increased.

In any analysis of this type, there always exists the danger that the results may
be highly sensitive to the particular parameter values chosen. We have repeated the

experiments reported in Tables 6-8 for a wide range of values for the elasticities a
and 3 since these are the ones for which existing empirical work provides the least
guidance. The general conclusions we have reported were found to be quite robust.

38

V. Conclusions and Extension
The conclusions of this paper can perhaps be best summarized by reviewing the
range of recent empirical findings in macroeconomics which are consistent with our

model. First, because temporary base money innovations have real effects even
when perfectly observed, our model is consistent with the empirical results reported

by Barro and Hercowitz [1980] and Boschen and Grossman [1982] who found that

perceived, but unpredicted, monetary innovations were non-neutral. When
information is incomplete and private agents are unable to determine whether a
base money innovation is permanent or temporary, even permanent innovations will
have real effects.

Second, monetary signals affect real and nominal rates of interest. This is
consistent with the empirical results reported by Roley and Walsh [1985] and
Hardouvelis [1985], among others, who have shown that weekly announcements of

the money supply affect interest rates. Siegel [1985] has shown that money
announcements may affect interest rates by providing information about the real

economy even if money is neutral.

In our model, announcements provide

information about non-neutral financial and base money shocks as well.

Third, changes in the variance of either temporary or permanent base money
innovations relative to the variance of real shocks alters money-output correlations.
This is consistent with other equilibrium business cycle models which stress the role

of incomplete information, and with the empirical work of Lucas [1973], Alberro

[1981], and Kormendi and Maquire [1984]. In addition, our model predicts that
money-output correlations will be altered if the variance of base money innovations
changes relative to the variance of portfolio and banking sector disturbances.

Fourth, the work of Rush [1985] and Hardouvelis [1985] shows that innovations
in the base and innovations in the money multiplier have different correlations with
interest rates. This also is an implication of our model.

39

Finally, by explicitly incorporating a role for portfolio disturbances, our model
provides a stochastic framework for evaluating the role of such shocks in producing

business cycle fluctuations. Shifts between bank deposits and currency have been
emphasized in many discussions of the Great Depression (Friedman and Schwartz
[1963]).

The model we have studied treats the monetary base as an exogenous process.
Previous work by King and Trehan [1984] has emphasized that it is inappropriate to

use a monetary aggregate that is at least partially endogenous when testing for

monetary neutrality. However, the present model shows that innovations in an
exogenous monetary aggregate can also be correlated with output even if permanent
changes in the level of the aggregate are neutral.

The empirical evidence presented in Section I showed that innovations in the
base are correlated with innovations in real income and that lagged M2 helps predict

future real income. There are a number of reasons, however, why these, and other

summary statistics reported in Section I cannot directly be compared with the
implications of our model. First, the monetary base has not been an exogenous
variables in the U.S. Except for a period from late 1979 to late 1981, the Federal

Reserve has tended to focus on interest rates, letting the monetary base
endogenously respond to economic disturbances. A more complete model would need
to provide a description of policy behavior. Second, even when the base is exogenous,

the correlation between base innovations and income will depend on the relative
variances of the permanent and transitory components of base money innovations.

Third, our model ignored general money demand disturbances which seem,
empirically, to be relatively important. Fourth, we have ignored dynamics in our

model in the interests of tractability. Finally, our model suggests that empirical
work may need to incorporate more than one interest rate. These points all suggest

areas of future research, but the model of this paper represents a useful starting

40

point for understanding the effects of financial sector disturbances in an economy
with both inside and outside money.

There are many other dimensions along which the model analyzed here could be
extended. For instance, we have assumed that only base money innovations contain

a permanent component. Other sorts of permanent shocks could easily be
incorporated. For simplicity, we assumed that the permanent and temporary
innovations to base money could be distinguished after one period. If individuals
only observe past values of the base and not its decomposition into permanent and
temporary components, then a source of persistence to monetary disturbances would

be introduced. Base money shocks will have real effects for several periods as
private agents try to infer whether the shocks are permanent or temporary.

Temporary base money shocks have real effects because the financial sector in

our model plays a real role in channeling loans to firms. Financial disturbances
which affect the size of the banking industry can produce changes in real loan supply

which require real interest rates to adjust in order to maintain equilibrium. This
result remains true even in the limit as financial intermediation becomes costless.

More generally, the results obtained here will be robust to a wide range of
variations in the model structure because the results depend ultimately on a
property of the model which is likely to characterize any rational expectations,
multi-asset model that recognizes a role for both inside and outside money. That
property is the dependence of equilibrium in the markets for output and physical
capital on ex ante real rates of return while financial market equilibrium depends on

nominal interest rates. A change in expected inflation will leave real rates
unaffected only if all nominal interest rates move by the same amount. Such
parallel movements in nominal rates, however, will be consistent with financial
market equilibrium only in very special cases.

Footnotes

1. We assume the short-run supply of deposits is determined by profit
maximization, holding fixed the capital invested in the banking sector. In the long-

run equilibrium, the number of banks would be determined by a requirement that
entry occurs until capital invested in the banking sector earns the competitive rate
of return given the risks (see, for example, Walsh [1983]). Since we analyze small

deviations around the long-run equilibrium, any changes in bank profits are of
second order.

2. It might be thought that qr and y should be related to each other via a
wealth constraint. If total wealth is independent of r, the requirement that the sum
of all assets equal total wealth would place adding up restrictions on the elasticities
of demand for each asset. In our model, however, both consumption and labor supply

will respond to variations in r so that the relevant adding up constraints will apply

to a more complicated intertemporal budget constraint and not just the asset
demands (2.6) and (2.7). The main issue from our present point of view is that y and
w are not related to each other in a simple way.

3. A reader uncomfortable with the assumption that there is a known
deterministic trend in addition to a permanent stochastic component to deviations

about trend can instead interpret the quantities denoted by lower case letters as
proportional deviations about some initial levels. It would be possible to allow
permanent and transitory components to other shocks. We focus on permanent
money supply shocks to show how the model can yield neutral and non-neutral
responses to money shocks under full information.

4. See Tobin and Brainard [1963] who discuss the effects a change in the sign
of 4) has on

the comparative statics of a fixed-price financial sector model.

5. See Romer [1985].

6. By Wairas' Law, equilibrium in the loan, deposits and currency markets
will also imply equilibrium in the goods market. In effect, this requires that total
household wealth minus the value of currency plus reserves equal the value of the
capital stock held by firms, or in flow terms that savings equal investment. For an
earlier example of a model which uses the asset market equilibrium conditions (in a
model with capital and outside money only) see Lucas [19751.

7. Equation (4.1) is consistent with the empirical results of Mankiw, Runkle,

and Shapiro [1984], who show that preliminary money stock numbers are noisy
signals, as opposed to rational forecasts of the money stock.

8. The body of empirical work initiated by Barro [1977] does not distinguish
between temporary and permanent innovations in the money supply. If agents only

observe x+v, x1 +v1,... , lagged monetary innovations will have real effects. In
addition to distinguishing between permanent and temporary base innovations, the
results of the previous section imply innovations to the base multiplier (due to w or
u) have different effects than innovations to the base. Rush [1985] finds that during
the Gold Standard period, only multiplier innovations were associated with output.

9. The rise is about 1.2 percent for a 5 percent base money shock and 0.96
percent for a 5 percent portfolio shock.

41.

10. Deposit rates fall about 0.8 percentage points for either a 5 percent base
money or portfolio shock, while loan rates fall about 1.1 percentage points for a 5
percent base money shock and 1.0 percentage points for a 5 percent portfolio shock.

11. It is worth mentioning that money multiplier innovations (n2) have a
negative effect on nominal interest rates since innovations in the multiplier signal
seem to be interpreted mainly as an opposite movement in the base. In part, this is
due to the absence of a common money demand shock, as can be seen from (2.6) and

(2.7): conditional on p, y, and r, the demand for "money" (kc + d) is deterministic.
Introducing a common asset demand shock in (2.6) and (2.7) is likely to produce a
positive effect of n on interest rates.

12. It is true for other variations in NB and G2NM which we have examined.
