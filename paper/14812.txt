Self-Enforcing Trade Agreements and Private Information
Kyle Bagwell
NBER Working Paper No. 14812
March 2009
JEL No. D82,F13
ABSTRACT
This paper considers self-enforcing trade agreements among privately informed governments. A trade
agreement that uses weak bindings (i.e., maximal tariff levels) is shown to offer advantages relative
to a trade agreement that uses strong bindings (i.e., precise tariff levels). Consistent with practice,
the theory also predicts that governments sometimes apply tariffs that are strictly below their bound
rates. When private information is persistent through time, an enforcement "ratchet effect" is identified:
a government reveals that it is "weak," and thus that it is unlikely to retaliate in an effective manner,
when it applies a low tariff. This effect suggests that a government with a low type may "pool" at an
above-optimal tariff, in order to conceal weakness. It also suggests a new information-based theory
of gradualism in trade agreements.

Introduction

When a government imposes an import tari¤, the tari¤ lowers the world price at which foreign
exporters sell and thus induces a terms-of-trade loss for the foreign country. A trade agreement
that features reciprocal liberalization can then be mutually bene…cial for governments by raising
trade volumes to more e¢ cient levels, where e¢ ciency is measured relative to the political-economic
preferences of governments.1 A cooperative trade agreement of this kind, however, can be achieved
only if it is self-enforcing.2 In other words, cooperation can be achieved only if each government
perceives that its short-term bene…t of cheating is outweighed by the expected discounted future
cost of the consequent deterioration in cooperation.
When governments design a self-enforcing trade agreement, a further complication is that they
may be uncertain about the political pressures that they will face in the future. Governments then
cannot know with certainty the tari¤ levels that will be e¢ cient from their joint perspective in
future periods. Of course, if political pressures were publicly observable, then governments could
design a state-contingent agreement, in which they agree to apply the tari¤s that are e¢ cient
given whatever future preferences they may hold. Broad movements in political pressures may be
publicly observable; however, at any given point in time, each government is likely to possess some
private information about the extent of its political pressures. This information may pertain to
transitory ‡uctuations in political pressures, but it is also plausible that a government possesses
private information about political pressures that have persistent components.3
Private information introduces an incentive-compatibility problem. If the trade agreement is
designed to allow a government to apply a high tari¤ when it reports a high degree of pressure
from its import-competing industry, then even a government with low pressure may be tempted to
“lie” and apply the high tari¤, as it thereby enjoys a terms-of-trade gain. The presence of private
information may also interact with the requirement that the trade agreement be self-enforcing. This
interaction arises when the pressures that a government privately observes have persistent components. In that case, if a government applies a low tari¤, then another government may perceive that
the former government faces persistent and low political pressures. The former government then
may be perceived as “weak”and thus unlikely to retaliate aggressively should another government
cheat. Once this inference is made, the trade agreement may fail to be self-enforcing.
In sum, when governments design a trade agreement while recognizing that they will each
possess private information in the future, they may seek to lower average tari¤s, so as to address
the terms-of-trade externality, and to allow each government some discretion when applying its

The view that trade agreements must be self-enforcing is advanced by Bagwell and Staiger (1990, 2002), Dixit
(1987) and Maggi (1999), for example.
3
International relations scholars advance similar perspectives. For example, Frieden (1999) emphasizes that the
motivations of governments are not publicly observable; Tomz (2007) studies international debt and provides evidence
that governments are privately informed about their preference types, where a government’s type exhibits imperfect
persistence through time; and Coneybeare (1987) argues that some historical trade wars resulted from a misperception
by one government as to how essential its export goods were to another government.

tari¤, so as to facilitate better matching between a government’s applied tari¤ and its (privately
observed) political pressures. Finally, governments must recognize as well that, if the bene…ts of
better matching are realized, then a government’s applied tari¤ may reveal its private information.
If private information is persistent in nature, this revelation could in turn interact with the selfenforcement constraint, by altering another government’s perception as to the severity of retaliation
that it would face in the future were it to cheat today.
This discussion suggests a potential framework for interpreting an important design feature
of the GATT/WTO. Under GATT/WTO rules, governments do not negotiate “strong bindings”
(i.e., precise tari¤ levels); instead, they negotiate “weak bindings” (i.e., maximal tari¤ levels).
With an agreement to use a weak binding, a government thus agrees not to apply its tari¤ on the
relevant product at a level that exceeds the bound rate. The government is free, however, to exercise
“downward discretion”and apply a tari¤ below the bound rate. The preceding discussion suggests
that such a design could be attractive to governments as a way of lowering the average tari¤ while
facilitating improved downward matching between a government’s applied tari¤ and its political
pressure. In fact, many governments often do apply tari¤s that are strictly below their negotiated
tari¤ bindings. The discussion suggests as well, however, that governments might sometimes resist
applying tari¤s below their bound levels, in order not to be perceived as weak.
In this paper, we pursue these themes at a formal level. We do so by developing a theory of
self-enforcing trade agreements among privately informed governments, where the private information that governments possess may be persistent through time. We …rst put the self-enforcement
constraint to the side and develop a number of new …ndings for a static model. We then consider
a sequence of dynamic models, in which a government’s private information is transitory, perfectly
persistent and imperfectly persistent, respectively, in order to better understand the implications
of private information for the design of self-enforcing trade agreements.
Our main …ndings for the static model are as follows. We show that an agreement to use
a weak binding o¤ers governments greater expected joint welfare than they can achieve with an
agreement to use a strong binding or in the absence of an agreement. We also observe that applied
tari¤s are often below the bound level, when governments agree to the optimal weak binding. As
suggested above, a weak bound on tari¤s limits the extent to which tari¤s can impose terms-oftrade externalities while at the same time allowing downward discretion so as to facilitate a better
match between a government’s applied tari¤ and its level of political pressure. A strong binding,
by contrast, limits externalities but eliminates all discretion. Perhaps surprisingly, we …nd that an
agreement to use the optimal strong binding may o¤er less expected joint welfare to governments
than they achieve in the absence of an agreement. Moreover, we show that the expected applied
tari¤ is higher under an agreement to use the optimal weak binding than under an agreement to use
the optimal strong binding. Finally, we characterize the incentive-compatible tari¤s that maximize
expected joint welfare for governments and show that such second-best tari¤s entail a novel pattern
of distortions and cannot be implemented using weak or strong bindings.
In our analyses of dynamic models, we show that the applied tari¤s induced by the optimal weak

2

binding can be achieved as part of a self-enforcing agreement among patient governments when
private information is transitory; however, an enforcement “ratchet e¤ect” arises when political
pressures are perfectly persistent, in that a government that exercises downward discretion and
applies a tari¤ below the optimal weak binding reveals that it faces little pressure and thus that it
would be unlikely to retaliate in an e¤ective way were its trading partner to cheat on the agreement.
In response to this problem, a government with low pressure may “pool” and apply a tari¤ at the
bound rate and in excess of its optimal level, in order not to be perceived as weak. We also show that
the ratchet e¤ect may be overcome when political pressures are imperfectly persistent: governments
that are su¢ ciently patient are then able to achieve the applied tari¤s induced by the optimal weak
binding as part of a self-enforcing agreement. To achieve these tari¤s in a self-enforcing agreement,
governments must be more patient when political pressures are more persistent.
For the dynamic model with perfectly persistent types, we also explore an information-based
theory of gradualism in trade agreements, in which the tari¤s that governments apply under an
initial agreement reveal information about the persistent pressures that they face and thus guide
the determination of the bound tari¤ rates that they negotiate in a subsequent agreement. In
the equilibrium that we feature, a government with low pressure applies a tari¤ that is below the
bound rate in the initial agreement and then applies a lower tari¤ that is equal to the (reduced)
bound rate in the subsequent agreement. The theory entails “dynamic screening” and suggests
that applied tari¤s are more likely to be below bound rates in early negotiation rounds. The theory
thus suggests that “binding overhang” should decline over time for a given country and may be
larger across countries for new WTO members.4 For any positive discount factor that governments
may possess and regardless of the pressures that they face, we show that the featured equilibrium
generates strictly higher payo¤s for governments than they achieve in the absence of an agreement.
This paper contributes to the literature at three levels. First, at a methodological level, this
paper contributes to the theory of trade agreements among governments with private information.
Building on recent work on collusion among privately informed …rms by Athey and Bagwell (2001,
2008) and Athey, Bagwell and Sanchirico (2004), this paper joins a small and recent literature that
explores self-enforcing trade agreements among privately informed governments. This literature
includes Bagwell and Staiger (2005), Lee (2007) and Martin and Vergote (2008).5 With the exception of Athey and Bagwell (2008), all of these papers assume that private information is transitory.
When private information exhibits persistence, the analysis becomes more complex, since a player’s
behavior may signal his information and thereby a¤ect the beliefs of other players. The present
paper appears to be the …rst analysis of self-enforcing trade agreements between governments with
4
Bchir, Sebastien and Laborde (2005) report that the recent extent of binding overhang is on average greater for
developing than developed countries. Binding overhang is more signi…cant in some developing countries than others,
and binding overhang is also signi…cant in some developed countries (e.g., some members of EFTA). Many developing
countries are new WTO members, having joined in the Uruguay Round.
5
See also Feenstra and Lewis (1991) and Park (2006). Feenstra and Lewis (1991) consider trade policies among
privately informed governments in a static model that allows for transfers between governments. We require here that
trade agreements are self-enforcing and do not permit transfers. Park (2006) considers self-enforcing trade agreements
among governments that observe private signals about the levels of concealed trade barriers.

persistent private information. Methodologically, the analysis found here also di¤ers from that in
Athey and Bagwell (2008), since the trade application results in a signi…cantly di¤erent structure
for payo¤ functions.6
Second, at a substantive level, this paper o¤ers new insights with respect to use of bound and
applied tari¤s in trade agreements. In both the static and dynamic models, we identify circumstances under which governments with low political pressures apply tari¤s that are strictly below
their bound rates. This …nding is also developed by Bagwell and Staiger (2005).7 The present
paper di¤ers on several important dimensions. In the present paper, we extract additional predictions by using a two-type (as opposed to a continuum-type) model. For example, in the static
analysis, we present several new results, including the …nding that an agreement to use the optimal
strong binding may be worse for governments than having no agreement whatsoever and also the
characterization of second-best tari¤s. In the dynamic model, the two-type framework is su¢ ciently tractable that we can analyze and compare self-enforcing trade agreements when private
information is transitory, perfectly persistent and imperfectly persistent. We show that the selfenforcement constraint requires greater patience from governments when their private information
is more persistent. We also identify a new ratchet e¤ect and characterize novel pooling behavior
when private information is persistent.
Finally, this paper contributes to an established literature that considers explanations for the
gradual manner in which trade is liberalized over time through GATT/WTO rounds. For example,
Devereux (1997), Maggi and Rodriguez-Clare (2007) and Staiger (1995) provide models in which
liberalization leads to changes in structural variables (associated with learning by doing, the allocation of capital and worker locations, respectively), which in turn interact with the self-enforcement
constraints in a way that makes further liberalization possible.8 As discussed above, we present
here a new information-based foundation for gradualism in trade agreements
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the basic model of trade. Results for the
static model are presented in Section 3. In Section 4, we analyze the repeated game with transitory
shocks, while Section 5 contains our analysis of the dynamic game with perfectly persistent shocks.
The dynamic game with imperfectly peristent shocks is considered in Section 6. In Section 7, we
present our results on gradualism. Section 8 concludes. Remaining proofs are in the Appendix.

The Model

In this section, we present our basic model of trade, and we characterize Nash and e¢ cient tari¤
choices. We also consider incentive-compatible trade policies.
6

This point is developed further in the …nal paragraph of Section 3.
Horn, Maggi and Staiger (2006) develop a related …nding in a static model without private information that
allows for contracting costs. Maggi and Rodriguez-Clare (2007) analyze a model in which applied tari¤s are set at
bound levels in equilibrium; yet, the potential for governments to apply a tari¤ below the bound level encourages
ex post lobbying and mitigates an overinvestment problem. If import-competing …rms are risk averse, a government
may also keep its applied tari¤ below the bound rate in order to create policy space, so that the applied tari¤ can
adjust to world-price ‡uctuations and reduce local-price variability. See, for example, Bagwell and Sykes (2004).

2.1

Basic Set Up

We consider a partial-equilibrium model in which trade occurs in two goods between two countries.
The home country exports good y and imports good x; while the foreign country exports good x
and imports good y: Let Px and Py denote the local prices of goods x and y; respectively, in the
home country. Using an asterisk to denote foreign country variables, we denote the local prices
of goods x and y in the foreign country as Px and Py , respectively. Each good is produced and
demanded in each country. We assume that demand functions are symmetric across goods and
countries. Gains from trade arise, since the two countries have di¤erent domestic supply functions.
The demand and supply functions take simple linear forms. For good i = x; y, the home-country
demand function is D(Pi ) = 1 Pi , and the foreign-country demand function is D(Pi ) = 1 Pi : The
home- and foreign-country supply functions for goods x and y are Qx (Px ) = Px =2, Qy (Py ) = Py ,
Qx (Px ) = Px , and Qy (Py ) = Py =2, respectively.9 Notice that the countries are symmetric, in that
the supply functions in the foreign country are the mirror image of those in the home country.
The corresponding producer surplus (pro…t) functions are
x (Px )

= (Px )2 =2 and

y (Py )

y (Py )

= (Py )2 =2,

= (Py )2 =4. Finally, we de…ne home- and foreign-country import

and export functions as follows: Mx (Px )

D(Px )

D(Py )

D(Px ); respectively.

Qy (Py ) and Ex (Px )

= (Px )2 =4,

x (Px )

Qx (Px )

Qx (Px ); Ey (Py )

The government of each country selects a speci…c import tari¤. Let

Qy (Py )
and

D(Py ), My (Py )
respectively denote

the tari¤s of the home- and foreign-country governments. Market-clearing prices are determined
once the tari¤s are imposed. Home-country exporters of good y receive the world price Pyw
and foreign-country exporters of good x sell at the world price

do not prohibit trade, the local price for an imported good is determined as Px = Pxw +

and

: With these relationships in place, we may determine the market-clearing world
and Pyw ( ); as the world prices that respectively satisfy the following market-clearing

conditions: Mx (Pxw + ) = Ex (Pxw ) and My (Pyw + ) = Ey (Pyw ): The remaining local prices are
then determined as Pbx ( )
Pxw ( ) + and Pby ( )
Pyw ( ) + : The explicit solutions are
P w ( ) = [4 3 ]=7, P w ( ) = [4 3 ]=7, Pbx ( ) = 4[1 + ]=7 and Pb ( ) = 4[1 + ]=7 for < 1=6

and

< 1=6: Trade in a good is prohibited if the import tari¤ on that good equals or exceeds 1=6:

We now consider government preferences. Following Baldwin (1987), we assume that each

government maximizes a weighted sum of consumer surplus, producer surplus and tari¤ revenue,
where due to political-economy pressures each government places a greater weight on producer
surplus in its import-competing industry.10 Formally, let

2 [1; 7=4] denote the weight placed

by the government of the home country on the producer surplus enjoyed by its import-competing
industry. We may now de…ne the welfare experienced by the government of the home country on
9
Following Bagwell and Staiger (2001, 2005), we can derive these supply functions from underlying production
functions, in which labor is the only input and the home (foreign) country has a higher marginal product of labor
for good y (x). As usual, the partial-equilibrium model can be reinterpreted as a general-equilibrium model in which
there is an additional traded numeraire good in the background, where consumers possess quasi-linear preferences
and the numeraire good is consumed in each country and produced under constant returns from labor.

Grossman and Helpman (1994) provide microfoundations for such government preference functions.

Likewise, on its export good, the government of the home country enjoys the following welfare:

The total welfare enjoyed by the government of the home country is then Wx (Pbx ; Pxw ) + Wy (Pyw ):

The welfare for the government of the foreign country is de…ned in an analogous fashion. Let

2 [1; 7=4] denote the weight placed by the government of the foreign country on the producer

surplus in its import-competing industry. The welfares that the government of the foreign country
enjoys on its import and export goods are respectively de…ned as follows:

The total welfare enjoyed by the government of the foreign country is then Wy (Pby ; Pyw ) + Wx (Pxw ).
Recalling that local and world prices are determined by tari¤s, we observe that government

welfares are ultimately functions of tari¤s. The home-country tari¤, , a¤ects the home-country

government’s welfare on its import good, Wx , and the foreign-country government’s welfare on its
export good, Wx . Thus, we may characterize the Nash and e¢ cient choices of

with reference

only to Wx and Wx . Given the symmetry of the model, we henceforth focus on good x. We also
observe that only the home-country political-economy parameter, , in‡uences the determination
of the Nash and e¢ cient choices for :

Nash and E¢ cient Tari¤s

We now characterize the Nash and e¢ cient tari¤s. We start with the Nash tari¤. The optimal

) is strictly increasing in : Intuitively, a higher tari¤ is more attractive to a government

that values more heavily the producer surplus enjoyed in the import-competing industry. The case
in which the government of the home country maximizes national welfare is captured when

= 1.

The home-country tari¤ also induces a negative externality on the welfare of the foreign government. Using (2), we may con…rm that Wx ( ) is strictly decreasing in

=

N(

) over

2 [1; 7=4):

Intuitively, when the government of the home country raises its import tari¤, the world price of

the foreign country’s export good is reduced. This terms-of-trade externality reduces the producer
surplus of foreign exporters. Hence, the government of the foreign country is strictly harmed by an
increase in the home-country tari¤, so long as the foreign country is exporting a positive volume
(i.e., provided

< 1=6). Due to this negative externality, Nash tari¤s are ine¢ cient, when e¢ ciency

is measured relative to the joint welfare of the home and foreign governments.
In our partial-equilibrium setting, the e¢ cient tari¤ for the home government is the tari¤ that
maximizes joint welfare on the imported good. Formally, for a given political-economy parameter
, the e¢ cient tari¤ maximizes J( ; )

Wx ( ; ) + Wx ( ). Using (1) and (2), we …nd that the

we may use (3) and (4) to …nd that

tari¤, since only the latter re‡ects a concern with the negative externality that ‡ows from the
home-country tari¤ to foreign-country welfare. As

rises, the Nash tari¤ rises and the Nash trade

volume thus falls. The reduced trade volume in turn implies a diminished role for the terms-of-trade

externality; consequently, the di¤erence between

) and

E(

) falls as

rises. At

= 7=4, the

Nash and e¢ cient tari¤s agree, as both then equal 1=6 and thus prohibit all trade. In the analysis
below, we assume that the political-economy parameter is either low ( = L) or high ( = H). To
focus attention on political-economy pressures that are never so severe as to result in a prohibition
of trade, we assume that 1

L < H < 7=4:
7

2.3

Incentive-Compatible Tari¤s

The political-economy parameters,

and

, are drawn independently from a common distribution.

For any government, the probability that the political-economy parameter takes value L is denoted
as

L

L

2 (0; 1). Each government privately observes its own realized political-economy

parameter. Below, we often refer to a government’s parameter as its “type.”

When governments have private information, some applied tari¤ schedules fail to be incentive
compatible. For example, governments might seek to implement the e¢ cient tari¤ schedule under
which a government applies the tari¤ that is e¢ cient given its type. Under this arrangement, the
government of the home country is expected to apply the tari¤

If this is the case, then the home-country government

may “lie” and behave as if it has a high type when in fact it has a low type. Intuitively, since
the e¢ cient tari¤ is higher when the home-country government has a high type, this government
may be tempted to lie and report a high type as it can then apply a higher tari¤ and enjoy the
consequent terms-of-trade gain.
We next de…ne the incentive-compatibility constraint for the static model. To this end, it is

Static Model: Analysis

In this section, we analyze the static model. We distinguish between two kinds of bounds on applied
tari¤s. In an agreement with strong bindings, a government must apply a tari¤ that equals the
bound rate; whereas, in an agreement with weak bindings, a government can apply any tari¤ that
does not exceed the bound rate. We characterize the optimal strong and weak bindings, and we
compare expected government welfare under these bindings with the expected welfare achieved
under Nash tari¤s. We also characterize the most e¢ cient tari¤s that are incentive compatible.

8

3.1

Optimal Strong Bindings

Under an agreement with a strong binding, each government agrees to set its applied tari¤ precisely
at the bound rate, regardless of the political pressure that it faces. Due to the terms-of-trade
externality, Nash tari¤s are higher than is e¢ cient, and a strong binding can o¤er the bene…t of
preventing high tari¤s. A strong binding also has a potential cost, however, in that it eliminates a
government’s ability to exercise discretion and set its applied tari¤ at a rate that re‡ects its political
situation. An interesting issue is thus whether an agreement with a strong binding can always be
found which o¤ers greater expected welfare to governments than they would be able to achieve in
the absence of an agreement.
Let

S

denote a strong binding. In an agreement with a strong binding, the induced applied

tari¤ schedule is ( )

S.

If governments negotiate an agreement with a strong binding, then

they may seek the strong binding that maximizes joint expected welfare. We thus de…ne an optimal
S,
A

strong binding,

as the solution to the following program:
max EJ(

S

S

; );

where E is the expectation operation taken with respect to . We do not include here an incentivecompatibility constraint, since the applied tari¤s induced by a strong binding do not vary with type
and thus are trivially incentive compatible. Given that Wx ( ; ) is linear in , the optimal strong
binding must maximize J(

S; E

), where E

=

(E ) =

H H.

Using (4), we thus conclude that

4(E

(7)

In short, the optimal strong binding is the e¢ cient tari¤ for the expected type.
We seek to compare expected joint welfare when governments reach an agreement to use the
optimal strong binding with the expected joint welfare when governments have no agreement and
thus apply Nash tari¤s. For a given good, it is clear that the expected welfare for the government
of the importing country (i.e., EWx ) is higher when it is allowed to apply Nash tari¤s. It is more
interesting to consider expected welfare for the government of the exporting country (i.e., EWx ).
As suggested above, it reasonable to anticipate that an agreement to use the optimal strong binding
would lower the expected applied tari¤. Such an agreement would also reduce the variance in the
applied tari¤. Since the welfare of the government of the exporting country is decreasing and convex
in the applied tari¤, it is not immediately clear whether an agreement to use the optimal strong
binding would increase the expected welfare of the exporting country.
Despite these con‡icting considerations, we are able to report the following:
Proposition 1: (i) The expected Nash tari¤ is strictly higher than the optimal strong binding:
E

N(

)>

S:

(ii) Expected welfare for the government of the exporting country is strictly higher

when the applied tari¤ is induced by the optimal strong binding than when the Nash tari¤ s are
applied: Wx (

N(

)):

Thus, for a given good, the government of the exporting country strictly prefers the applied tari¤
induced by the optimal strong binding to the applied Nash tari¤s, while the government of the
importing country has the opposite preference. The proof is found in the Appendix.
We next analyze the e¤ect of an agreement to use the optimal strong binding on expected
joint welfare. Before undertaking this analysis, however, we impose a parameter restriction that
is maintained throughout the remainder of the paper. In particular, we assume that the optimal
S
A

strong binding exceeds the Nash tari¤ when the type is low:

=

E (E

N (L).

)>

As we con…rm

below, when this inequality holds, the optimal weak and strong bindings induce di¤erent applied
tari¤s, and the optimal weak binding is such that a government with a low type applies a tari¤
that is strictly below the bound level. Using (3) and (7), we may restate the desired inequality in
terms of the following restriction on parameters: E > (8L + 7)=12:
Consider now Figure 1. As shown there, the optimal strong binding induces an applied tari¤
that is higher (lower) than would be e¢ cient when the type is low (high). Given our parameter
restriction, the optimal strong binding induces an applied tari¤ that is higher than the applied
Nash tari¤ when the type is low. Thus, in the event that the government of the importing country
has a low type, the optimal strong binding is less e¢ cient than is the corresponding Nash tari¤.
By contrast, in the event that the type is high, the e¢ cient tari¤ is below the corresponding Nash
tari¤ and above the applied tari¤ that is induced by the optimal strong binding. A trade-o¤ may
thus arise across the two events, since the optimal strong binding may be more e¢ cient than the
Nash tari¤ when the type is high.
Looking at Figure 1, however, we may anticipate one circumstance in which a trade-o¤ across
events fails to arise. In particular, suppose that the di¤erence in types is large, so that H is near
7=4 while L is well below this bound. The di¤erence between

N (H)

E (H)

and

is then small, and

so the Nash tari¤ is approximately e¢ cient when the type is high. The optimal strong binding,
however, equals

E (E

E (H),

) and thus remains below

smaller. Thus, when H

L is large in this sense and

H

with the gap being larger when

H

is not too high, we anticipate that joint

welfare is higher when Nash tari¤s are applied than when an agreement to use the optimal strong
binding is reached, whether the importing government’s type is low or high. If this reasoning is
correct, then circumstances exist under which an agreement to use a strong binding cannot improve
upon the no-agreement benchmark in which Nash tari¤s are applied.
We introduce a proposition below that con…rms this reasoning and o¤ers further comparisons.
To state the proposition, we require a few de…nitions. Consider …rst our parameter restriction

The proof of this proposition is found in the Appendix.
Proposition 2 may be understood with reference to Figure 2. Part (i) of the proposition applies
when L and H reside in region A. For a particular point x = (H; L) in this region, there exists a
critical value eH 2 (1=3; 1) such that L = L(H; eH ). In the …gure, the parameter value eH generates

the dotted line that passes through x. For any

that

the optimal strong binding then generates strictly higher expected welfare than occurs in the Nash
equilibrium. Intuitively, when H L is small, the volume of trade is large even when the government
of the importing country has a high type and sets its Nash tari¤. The presence of a large trade
volume in turn implies that the terms-of-trade externality plays an important role, with the result
being a large di¤erence between the Nash and e¢ cient tari¤s in the high-type state.
Part (ii) of the proposition concerns region B. For a particular point y = (H; L) in this region,

Joint welfare is then approximately the same in the low-type state

whether governments have an agreement or not. In this region, however, the volume of trade is low
when the government has a high type and applies its Nash tari¤. Accordingly, the terms-of-trade
externality then plays a small role, and so the Nash tari¤ is close to e¢ cient in the high-type state.
Expected joint welfare is then strictly higher for governments when they have no agreement and
11

thus apply their Nash tari¤s. Finally, for higher values of

H,

an agreement to use the optimal

strong binding generates strictly higher expected joint welfare. To see this, note that when

H

1,

so that the government of the importing country almost always has a high type, the optimal strong
binding induces an applied tari¤ that is approximately equal to

E (H).

An agreement to use the

optimal strong binding then induces an applied tari¤ that is almost always approximately e¢ cient.
In general, when governments are privately informed as to their political pressures, a trade
agreement has two roles to serve. First, it should reduce the average tari¤ and thereby undo
the ine¢ ciency that is attributable to the terms-of-trade externality. Second, it should provide
su¢ cient ‡exibility that governments can adjust their tari¤s to their political circumstances. An
agreement to use an optimal strong binding addresses the …rst role and neglects the second. As
Proposition 2 indicates, in some cases, such an agreement generates lower expected joint welfare
for governments than they achieve in the absence of any agreement. Proposition 2 thus provides
motivation to consider alternative forms for agreements, in which the average tari¤ is lowered and
yet governments are also able to exercise some discretion in an incentive-compatible way. We thus
next consider an agreement to use a weak binding.

3.2

Optimal Weak Bindings

We consider now an agreement to use a weak binding. With such an agreement, governments
place an upper bound on the permissible level of an applied tari¤, and at the same time provide
downward discretion so that a government can apply a tari¤ below the binding if it so chooses. An
agreement with a weak binding thus o¤ers scope for lowering the average tari¤ from the Nash level
while also providing downward ‡exibility.
Let

W

denote a weak binding. In an agreement with a weak binding, the induced applied tari¤

schedule is ( ) = minf

W; N(

)g. Intuitively, a government applies a tari¤ below the bound

rate, if its optimal tari¤ is below the bound rate. Otherwise, the government applies a tari¤ equal
to the bound rate, as it thereby applies a tari¤ that is as close to its optimal rate as possible.
When governments negotiate an agreement with a weak binding, they may select the weak binding
that maximizes expected joint welfare. Accordingly, we de…ne an optimal weak binding,

W,
A

as the

solution to the following program:
max EJ(minf

W

W

;

N

( )g; ):

It is not necessary to include an incentive compatibility constraint, since this constraint is automatically satis…ed: a weak binding precludes (places no restrictions on) the application of a tari¤
above (below) the bound rate.
Consider now various candidates for
its import tari¤ at

N (H)

W.

First, if

when its type is high and at

W

N (H),
N (L)

then a government would set

when its type is low. Thus, a weak

binding in this range simply induces the application of Nash tari¤s. We may conclude that, when
governments agree on the optimal weak binding, their expected joint welfare cannot be lower than

12

W

that which they achieve under Nash tari¤s. Second, at the other extreme, if

N (L),

then

governments would always apply a tari¤ that is equal to the weak binding. In this case, the weak
binding performs like a strong binding. Under our parameter restriction, as argued above, the
optimal strong binding is

S
A

=

E (E

N (L):

Given that expected joint welfare is concave in

the applied tari¤, it follows that the optimal weak binding must satisfy
The third possibility is that

W

2(

N (L); N (H)).
W

is set at the level of the optimal strong binding:

W
A

N (L).

Suppose for example that the weak binding

=

S.
A

Given that

N (H)

>

S
A

>

N (L),

if

this weak binding is used and a government has a high type, then it would apply a tari¤ equal to
the binding. This weak binding thus induces the same applied tari¤ for a high type as does the
optimal strong binding. Now consider a government with a low type. Since the binding is weak,
this government would venture below the binding and apply its optimal tari¤,
that joint welfare is then strictly increased, since

Notice, too,
Since a weak

thus generates strictly higher expected welfare than does the optimal strong

binding, we conclude that governments are sure to achieve strictly higher expected joint welfare
when they agree on an optimal weak binding than when they agree on an optimal strong binding.
Intuitively, a weak binding can bound the maximal tari¤ just as e¤ectively as does a strong binding;
however, a weak binding o¤ers the further advantage of e¢ ciency-enhancing downward discretion.

Thus, an

Our next task is to determine the optimal weak binding. We establish above that
W

For any

N (L),

a government with a low type applies its optimal tari¤,

optimal weak binding only a¤ects the tari¤ that is applied by a government with a high type.
Consequently, the optimal weak binding is set at the e¢ cient tari¤ for a government with a high
type:

W
A

=

E (H):

Observe that the optimal weak binding is strictly higher than the optimal strong binding:
W
A

=

E (H)

E (E

S.
A

Intuitively, the optimal strong binding induces an applied tari¤

that is below the level that would be e¢ cient when the government has a high type, since under
a strong binding the applied tari¤ for a high type cannot be increased without increasing, too,
the applied tari¤ for a low type. With a weak binding, governments have more ‡exibility, and
it becomes possible to induce a higher and more e¢ cient tari¤ for the high type of government
without altering the tari¤ that a low type would apply.
We can summarize our results to this point with the following proposition.
Proposition 3: When governments reach an agreement to use an optimal weak binding, they enjoy
expected joint welfare that is strictly higher than that which they would achieve in an agreement to
use an optimal strong binding and than that which they would achieve if Nash tari¤ s were applied.
The optimal weak binding is strictly higher than the optimal strong binding. When governments
agree to use the optimal weak binding, a government with a low level of political pressure applies
its optimal tari¤ , and this tari¤ is strictly below the bound rate.
This result provides one interpretation for the observation that governments often apply tari¤s that
are below the weak bound rates to which they agree in GATT/WTO negotiations. Bagwell and
13

Staiger (2005) report a similar result in a model with a continuum of types. The two-type model
considered here allows for a simple proof of the result. As we show below, in the two-type setting,
we can also report new results about the magnitude of expected applied tari¤s. Finally, Proposition
3 also leads to the prediction that a government’s applied tari¤ should be higher when the export
supply function is less elastic, in the event that the applied tari¤ is below the bound rate. This
follows since the applied tari¤ is then an optimal tari¤ (given the government’s preferences).11
Proposition 3 establishes that the optimal weak binding exceeds the optimal strong binding. An
interesting question is whether the applied tari¤s that are induced by the respective bindings can
be similarly ranked. We next show that, given our parameter restriction, the optimal weak binding
induces a strictly higher expected applied tari¤ than does the optimal strong binding.12 This is
perhaps somewhat surprising, since the traditional terms-of-trade reasoning suggests that expected
joint welfare gains are achieved through reductions in tari¤s. Intuitively, when governments use a
strong binding, they are unable to customize their applied tari¤s to their political circumstances;
hence, they simply focus on reducing the average applied tari¤. When weak bindings are used,
however, governments have some ‡exibility, and they are able to raise the applied tari¤ to a more
e¢ cient level when political pressures are high.
Proposition 4: The expected Nash tari¤ is strictly higher than the expected applied tari¤ when
governments agree to use the optimal weak binding, and the expected applied tari¤ when governments
agree to use the optimal weak binding is strictly higher than the optimal strong binding.
The proof is found in the Appendix.

3.3

Second-Best Tari¤s

In this subsection, we consider all of the applied tari¤ schedules that are incentive compatible when
transfers are not feasible. Our analysis thus includes the applied tari¤s that are induced by strong
and weak bindings; however, we no longer require that the applied tari¤ schedule can be induced
by a strong or weak binding. Our …ndings in this subsection thus provide a benchmark against
which an agreement with strong or weak bindings might be compared.
Let ( ) denote an incentive-compatible applied tari¤ schedule. We de…ne the second-best tari¤ s
as the applied tari¤ schedule,

SB (

), that solves the following second-best program:

max EJ( ( ); ) s.t. ( ) satis…es (6).
( )

We observe above that an applied tari¤ schedule is incentive compatible only if it is nondecreasing.
Our goal now is to characterize the second-best tari¤s.
11
See Broda, Limao and Weinstein (2008) for an examination of the empirical relationship between export supply
elasticities and the import tari¤s applied by governments prior to accession in the WTO.
12
Without our parameter restriction, it is possible that the optimal weak and strong bindings would be set at a
common level below N (L) and thus induce the same applied tari¤.

LF B (H) is strictly increasing and convex in H for H 2 [65=44; 7=4). We note that LF B (7=4) = 7=4.
As shown in Figure 3, LF B (H) lies strictly below L(H; 1) and strictly above L(H; 1=2): The region

for which our …rst case holds is the set of L and H that lie on or to the southeast of LF B (H).
Over this region, the di¤erence between H and L is relatively large. We note as well that, if

Thus, in our two-type model, if the types are far apart, e¢ cient tari¤s are incentive compatible.
Recall that the optimal weak binding does not induce the application of the e¢ cient tari¤s. It is
instructive to review the logic behind this …nding. If a weak binding were to induce the application

Hence,

While the

In terms of Figure 3, the region for which (12) holds is the set of L and H that lie to the northwest

In fact, whether or not our parameter restriction holds, it is impossible to induce the application of e¢ cient tari¤s
using a weak binding. Given E (H) < N (H), a government with the high type applies E (H) only if the weak

of LF B (H). Clearly, e¢ cient tari¤s fail to be incentive compatible in this case: a government with
a low type would “lie”and pretend to have a high type. In this second case, the second-best tari¤s
must involve a distortion from the e¢ cient tari¤s, for at least one or possibly both types.
To better understand this second case, we suppose initially that governments apply the tari¤s,
E (H)

(H) =

and (L) =

N (L),

that are induced by the optimal weak binding. A government

with a low type then strictly prefers to select the low-type rather than the high-type tari¤. We
may thus engineer a strictly higher level of expected joint welfare by lowering the low-type tari¤
to the critical level at which a government with a low type is indi¤erent to “lying” and selecting
the high-type tari¤. Under (12), the critical low-type tari¤ falls strictly between

E (L)

and

N (L).

At this point, we may engineer a further strict improvement by raising the high-type tari¤ to a
level that is slightly above

E (H).

This small change in the high-type tari¤ itself has no …rst-order

e¤ect on expected joint welfare; however, it reduces the gain to lying and thereby faciliates a strict
improvement by enabling a further reduction in the low-type tari¤ toward
in this fashion, raising the high-type tari¤ above
E (L);

E (H)

We may continue

and lowering the low-type tari¤ toward

We generalize this argument in the Appendix and establish the following proposition:

There exists values for L and H that satisfy (12) and our parameter restriction, if

is su¢ ciently large.

We also con…rm in the Appendix the stated relationships between (12) and the model parameters.
It is interesting to compare the second-best tari¤s characterized in Proposition 6 with the
applied tari¤s induced by the optimal weak binding. We make two observations. First, like the
e¢ cient tari¤s, the second-best tari¤s characterized in Proposition 6 cannot be induced through an
agreement to use a weak (or strong) binding. Instead, an agreement that implements the secondbest tari¤s would allow two particular tari¤s, (L) and (H), and regard any other selection as
a violation. An agreement of this kind requires careful calibration and monitoring; thus, it is
perhaps understandable that this form of agreement is not descriptive of actual GATT/WTO tari¤
agreements. Nevertheless, it is instructive to understand the form that an optimal agreement
takes, if governments possess private information and are otherwise free from transaction costs.
Second, the second-best tari¤s entail a wider spread than do the applied tari¤s induced by the
optimal weak binding; in particular, under the second-best tari¤ schedule, the lowest tari¤ is lower
(

SB (L)

<

N (L))

and the highest tari¤ is higher (

SB (H)

>

E (H)).

It is also interesting to compare the second-best tari¤s characterized in Proposition 6 with the
e¢ cient tari¤s. Notice that the second-best tari¤s entail distortions at the bottom and at the top:
the low type of government applies a tari¤ that is above the e¢ cient level (
16

SB (L)

>

E (L)),

and

the high type of government also applies a tari¤ that exceeds the e¢ cient level (

SB (H)

>

E (H)).

This …nding contrasts with the usual “no-distortion-at-the-top” …nding that obtains in a standard
Principal-Agent problem, in which a Principal maximizes its objective and provides a menu of
choices to a privately informed Agent. The problem we analyze here is di¤erent in two respects.
First, we do not have a Principal; instead, we maximize Agents’expected joint welfare and provide
a menu of choices to privately informed Agents. Second, unlike the standard Principal-Agent
problem, our analysis does not allow for transfers. The absence of transfers makes the second-best
program more challenging to analyze. When transfers are allowed, governments can design a trade
agreement in which they achieve e¢ cient tari¤s.
Our analysis is also related to recent work on repeated games with private information by Athey,
Atkeson and Kehoe (2005), Athey and Bagwell (2001, 2008) and Athey, Bagwell and Sanchirico
(2004). In the stage games used in this work, one player’s expected welfare is a¤ected by the
actions of another player through the probability that the latter player’s action is higher than
the former player’s action or through the mean action level of the latter player. Correspondingly,
under appropriate distributional assumptions, the second-best schedule for the Agents involves rigid
behavior (i.e., a strong binding) or downward discretion with a cap (i.e., a weak binding). The trade
application considered here has a novel payo¤ structure, in that government welfare functions take
a separable form and are quadratic in tari¤s. As (2) con…rms, one government’s welfare is a¤ected
by the mean and variance of the other government’s tari¤. Working with a two-type model, we
o¤er in Proposition 6 a simple characterization of the second-best tari¤s for this linear-quadratic
setting. Interestingly, the second-best tari¤s cannot be achieved with a strong or weak binding.

4

Enforcement: Transitory Shocks

In the previous section, we analyze a static model and simply assume that any agreement can be
enforced. In fact, trade agreements must be self-enforcing. In the remainder of paper, we therefore
focus on dynamic models. This enables us to formalize the idea that a government will honor its
commitments under a trade agreement, if it perceives that the short-term bene…t of “cheating” is
less than the long-term cost of the ensuing retaliatory measures that its trading partner would then
adopt. We thus characterize self-enforcing trade agreements as equilibria of a repeated or dynamic
game with private information.
In the sections that follow, we assume that governments seek to establish a “simple” trade
agreement in which they negotiate bound tari¤ rates. In much of our analysis, we consider whether
governments can enforce a trade agreement in which they apply the tari¤s that are induced by the
optimal weak binding. Throughout our analysis, in the event that a government cheats and applies
a tari¤ in excess of the bound rate, we assume that governments abandon cooperation and apply
Nash tari¤s thereafter. Of course, more sophisticated (e.g., carrot-stick) punishment schemes could
be entertained as well; however, if governments require an explicit agreement in order to coordinate
on a cooperative path, it is perhaps unlikely that a breakdown in cooperation would be consistent

17

with the coordination of a sophisticated punishment path.14
In the present section, we begin our formal analysis with a model in which each government’s
privately observed political-economy parameter (i.e., its type) is independently determined over
time. In subsequent sections, we build on this foundation and allow that the privately observed
types are perfectly and imperfectly persistent through time.

4.1

The Repeated Game with Transitory Shocks

The repeated game with transitory shocks is informally described as follows. In each period, each
government privately observes its type, where types are identically and independently distributed
across governments and over time. The governments then simultaneously apply their tari¤s, and
government welfare for the period is determined. Applied tari¤s are publicly observed. Thus,
at the start of any period t, each government observes a private history and a public history. A
government’s private history includes its knowledge of its current and past types. The public history
that governments share is their common observation of the tari¤s applied by both governments in all
preceding periods. The same sequence repeats in each of an in…nite number of periods, t = 1; :::; 1.

We consider the perfect public equilibria (Fudenberg, Levine and Maskin, 1994) of this game.

Hence, we require that each government uses a public strategy: the tari¤ that a government applies
in period t may depend on the public history of applied tari¤s and on this government’s private
observation of its current type; however, a government’s applied tari¤ in period t may not depend
upon payo¤-irrelevant private information, such as its private recollection of its types in previous
periods. We also restrict attention to symmetric perfect public equilibria, which we de…ne as perfect
public equilibria in which governments use ex ante symmetric strategies. Thus, in a symmetric
perfect public equilibrium, strategies are exchangeable across governments as a function of public
histories and current types and do not depend on governments’“names.” In this section, we refer
to symmetric perfect public equilibria as equilibria.
In repeated games with private information, a player may consider two kinds of deviations.15
A …rst kind of deviation is known as an on-schedule deviation. A deviation of this kind occurs
when a government has type

and the equilibrium tari¤s for L and H in period t

are distinct. An on-schedule deviation by one government is not observable, as a deviation, to the
other government. The second kind of deviation is called an o¤ -schedule deviation. A deviation of
this kind occurs in period t if a government applies a tari¤ that is not prescribed by the equilibrium
for either of the two possible types of governments. An o¤-schedule deviation by one government is

Following Bagwell and Staiger (2002, Chapter 6; 2005), we regard retaliation provisions in the WTO Dispute
Settlement Understanding as facilitating on-equilibrium-path rebalancing of tari¤s in response to political-economic
shocks. By contrast, the Nash reversion that follows an o¤-equilibrium-path deviation captures the understanding
among governments that non-compliant behavior could lead to a breakdown in the cooperative endeavor. In the
two-type model considered here, the scope for rebalancing provisions is limited. See Bagwell and Staiger (2005) for
a model with a continuum of types in which WTO escape clause rules can be interpreted as on-equilibrium-path
responses to political-economic shocks.

Our discussion here follows Athey and Bagwell (2001) and Athey, Bagwell and Sanchirico (2004).

observable, as a deviation, to the other government. In the event of an o¤-schedule deviation, play
has moved o¤ of the equilibrium path, and governments may then move into a punishment phase.
We assume that governments negotiate a trade agreement at date zero, before learning their
…rst-period types. In the present section, we assume further that the agreement takes the form of a
weak binding. The associated applied tari¤s can be enforced in an equilibrium of the repeated game
with transitory shocks if they do not invite on-schedule or o¤-schedule deviations. We de…ne below
a class of “weak-binding equilibria”for the repeated game, in which the applied tari¤s induced by a
weak binding do not give rise to an on-schedule deviation. For such equilibria, the important issue
is whether governments are su¢ ciently patient to resist undertaking an o¤-schedule deviation.

4.2

Weak-Binding Equilibria

We de…ne a weak-binding equilibrium as an equilibrium in which there exists a weak binding

W

such that (i) along the equilibrium path, governments apply tari¤s that are equal to or below
W,

and (ii) at any period t, the applied tari¤s selected by governments are independent of the

public history so long as no government has previously applied a tari¤ in excess of

W.

The …rst

requirement is simply a de…nition of a weak binding. If a government applies a tari¤ that exceeds
the bound rate, it has violated the agreement. The second requirement goes somewhat further and
posits that any applied tari¤ at or below the bound rate is “…ne,” in the sense that the applied
tari¤s selected in the future by one government are not sensitive to the particular way in which the
other government has met its weak-binding obligation.16
With the notion of a weak-binding equilibrium, we thus have a way to formalize the appealing
idea that an agreement to use a weak binding e¤ectively partitions the public history of applied
tari¤s into “good histories” (both governments have historically applied tari¤s that satisfy the
agreed-upon weak binding) and “bad histories” (at least one government has applied a tari¤ that
violates the weak binding). In the latter event, some government has taken an o¤-schedule deviation
in which it applied a tari¤ in excess of

W,

and governments then abandon cooperation and revert

to Nash tari¤s in all future periods. Notice, though, that governments do not punish (or reward)
an o¤-schedule deviation that involves an applied tari¤ that is at or below the weak binding. In
any period along the equilibrium path, governments can thus choose freely over all applied tari¤s
that satisfy the weak binding. Hence, in a weak-binding equilibrium,
schedule ( ;

induces the applied tari¤

)g, where our notation now makes explicit the dependence of

the applied tari¤ schedule on the weak binding. As noted in Section 3, the induced applied tari¤s
satisfy the incentive-compatibility constraint for the static game. We may thus conclude that the
applied tari¤s induced by a weak-binding equilibrium do not give rise to an on-schedule deviation.
The more interesting issue is whether governments are willing to forego o¤-schedule deviations
in which they apply tari¤s in excess of the weak binding. In the remainder of this section, we

In independent work, Aramendia, Ruiz and Wen (2008) propose a related solution concept for in…nitely repeated
games. Under this concept, players continue “as if nothing happened when a player deviates unilaterally without
harming the others in a period.” They consider a general family of games but do not allow for private information.

This re‡ects the idea that the cost of a Nash trade war

It is interesting to observe that, in the repeated game with transitory shocks, the critical discount factor, W

for supporting a weak-binding equilibrium in which governments use the optimal weak binding, W

the critical discount factor for supporting an equilibrium in which the governments apply tari¤s equal to the optimal

by raising the weak binding just enough to dissuade a high-type government from cheating.

Proposition 7 summarizes our formal analysis of the repeated game with transitory shocks. Bagwell
and Staiger (2005) …nd that part (a) also holds in a model with a continuum of types. Using our
two-type formulation, in parts (b) and (c) we show further that cooperation entails a higher weak
binding when governments are less patient and that cooperation is easier (i.e.,

W
A

is lower) among

governments that often face high political-economy pressures. We will see that related themes arise
in subsequent sections, when we allow for persistent types.

5

Enforcement: Perfectly Persistent Shocks

In the preceding section, we assume that governments privately observe political-economic pressures
that are transitory in nature. In this section, we maintain the assumption that each government
has some private information about its political-economic pressures; however, we now relax the assumption that these pressures are transitory. While the assumption of transitory shocks simpli…es
the analysis, it seems more realistic to allow that political-economic pressures exhibit some persistence. Once persistence is introduced, the analysis becomes more complex, since a government’s
tari¤ in the current period may reveal its current type and thereby reveal information about the
government’s probable future type. In the current section, we relax the assumption of transitory
shocks by taking the opposite extreme case and supposing that a government’s type is perfectly
persistent through time. In the next section, we discuss the case of imperfectly persistent shocks.

5.1

The Dynamic Game with Perfectly Persistent Shocks

The dynamic game with perfectly persistent shocks is informally described as follows. At the start of
the game, each government privately observes its type, where types are independently distributed
across governments and perfectly persistent (i.e., …xed) through time. The game is otherwise the
same as the repeated game with transitory shocks. Thus, in any period t, governments simultaneously apply their tari¤s, given the public history of previous applied tari¤s and governments’
private observations as to their respective types. Since types are now persistent over time, the
game is no longer a repeated game. It is instead a dynamic game.
As our solution concept, we consider perfect bayesian equilibria (Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991)
that satisfy the further re…nement that each government uses a public strategy. In turn, a govern23

ment uses a public strategy if in any period its applied tari¤ depends only on the public history at
that time and its payo¤-relevant private information. For our model, a government’s payo¤-relevant
private information is its type,

2 fL; Hg. Following Athey and Bagwell (2008), we may refer to

such re…ned equilibria as perfect public bayesian equilibria. Perfect public bayesian equilibrium is a
natural extension of perfect public equilibrium to dynamic bayesian games as opposed to repeated
games. In the dynamic game with persistent types, perfect public bayesian equilibria are de…ned
in terms of the strategy that each government uses in the dynamic game and the belief function
that each government uses when making inferences about the other government’s type. In a perfect
public bayesian equilibrium, each government’s public strategy must be sequentially rational and
its belief function must be bayesian where possible given the public history of observed tari¤s and
its understanding of the other government’s equilibrium strategy.
Since governments are ex ante symmetric, we also restrict attention to symmetric perfect public
bayesian equilibria. As in the previous section, the requirement of symmetry means that strategies
are exchangeable across governments and do not depend on governments’“names.” Even though
governments use ex ante symmetric strategies, asymmetries in governments’strategies may emerge
over time, as a result of asymmetric type realizations and past behavior. We refer to symmetric
perfect public bayesian equilibria as equilibria.
In the dynamic game with perfectly persistent types, we may again distinguish between onschedule and o¤-schedule deviations. An on-schedule deviation is now a deviation in which a
government with type
where

6=

0,

2 fL; Hg mimics the behavior that it would take were its type

0

2 fL; Hg;

in all periods of the game and for all public histories. An o¤-schedule deviation

occurs whenever a government applies tari¤s that are not consistent with the equilibrium strategies
of either type of government.
We assume that governments negotiate a trade agreement at date zero, before they learn their
respective types for the dynamic game. The probability that a government receives a high (low)
type for the dynamic game is

H

(

L ).

We focus again on the possibility of an agreement among

governments to use a weak binding. In previous sections, we de…ne the applied tari¤s that are
induced by an agreement to use a weak binding. Here, we consider whether these induced applied
tari¤s can be enforced in an equilibrium of the dynamic game with perfectly persistent types. We
identify a problem that may be associated with the enforcement of these tari¤s. We then consider
alternative applied tari¤s that can be enforced when a weak binding is used.

5.2

Weak-Binding Equilibria

As in the previous section, we de…ne a weak-binding equilibrium as an equilibrium in which there
exists a weak binding,
are equal to or below

W,
W,

such that (i) along the equilibrium path, governments apply tari¤s that
and (ii) at any period t, the applied tari¤s selected by governments are

independent of the public history so long as no government has previously applied a tari¤ in excess of
W.

Recall that the second requirement posits that any applied tari¤ at or below the weak binding is

“…ne.”Thus, in a weak-binding equilibrium, the applied tari¤ schedule ( ;
24

W)

= minf

W; N(

)g

is induced in all periods along the equilibrium path.
In a weak-binding equilibrium, if a government undertakes an o¤-schedule deviation in which it
W,

applies a tari¤ in excess of

then governments abdandon cooperation and revert to Nash tari¤s in

all future periods. Importantly, in the dynamic game with persistent types, a government’s expected
welfare under Nash play depends upon the government’s type and the government’s belief about
the other government’s type. If one government believes that the other government probably has a
high (low) type, then the former government expects that a Nash punishment would probably mean
that its exporters would face the tari¤

N (H)

(

N (L)).

A government’s belief must be bayesian in

equilibrium, and so a government’s expected value of future cooperation may be in‡uenced by the
particular applied tari¤s selected by the other government. Thus, while any applied tari¤ below
the weak binding may be …ne, it is unavoidable that one government’s particular selections may
a¤ect the other government’s bayesian beliefs about the former government’s type.
We distinguish between two ranges for the weak binding. Suppose …rst that

Let us now consider the o¤-schedule incentive constraint that arises for a government with
a high type in a weak-binding equilibrium when

W

In particular, suppose

that one government has a high type while the other government has a low type. In period one,
the former government necessarily applies the tari¤

while the latter government necessarily

At this point, the governments can infer each other’s types, and the

former government thus knows that the latter government has a low type. In the second period, a
government with a high type then cannot resist taking an o¤-schedule deviation in which it violates
the binding and applies its Nash tari¤,

N (H).

With respect to its import good, this government

gains from such an o¤-schedule deviation, since it thereby applies its Nash tari¤ in the current and
all future periods. With respect to its export good, this government does not gain or lose, since it
knows that the low-type government applies the tari¤

N (L)

in period two and all future periods

both on and o¤ of the equilibrium path (i.e., whether the governments continue cooperating or
revert to an in…nite Nash punishment). Hence, it cannot be true that a government with a high
type applies the tari¤

W

2 (

N (L); N (H))

in all periods along the equilibrium path, and we

25

therefore conclude that a weak-binding equilibrium fails to exist when
The following proposition summarizes our discussion to this point:

W

2(

N (L); N (H)).

Proposition 8: Consider the dynamic game with perfectly persistent shocks. (i) There exists
a weak-binding equilibrium with
2 fL; Hg applies its Nash tari¤

equilibrium with

W

2(

W

N (H).

N(

In any such equilibrium, a government of type

) in every period. (ii) There does not exist a weak-binding

N (L); N (H)):

Part (ii) of this proposition is most interesting and captures a “no-good-deed-goes-unpunished”
phenomenon. When a government has low political-economic pressures and thus applies a tari¤
below the bound level, the other government gains from this good deed. At the same time, the
other government then realizes that its partner has a low type and thus cannot credibly threaten
to raise its tari¤s in response to a violation. Given this realization, the other government cannot
resist “punishing”the good deed by cheating and applying a tari¤ in excess of the weak binding. In
e¤ect, when types are perfectly persistent, a “ratchet e¤ect”exists with respect to the enforcement
of an agreement to use a weak binding: once a government reveals that it has the weak type, the
other government cannot resist undertaking actions that hurt the former government.19
It is interesting to compare Propositions 7 and 8. When types are transitory, a government
with a low type today may have a high type tomorrow. Thus, when types are transitory and
W

2(

N (L); N (H)),

a government that cheats today is sure to su¤er some retaliatory cost in the

future, since the other government will apply

N (H)

rather than

W

in all future periods in which it

has a high type. This explains why, as Proposition 7 con…rms, su¢ ciently patient governments that
face transitory shocks can enforce an agreement to abide by the optimal weak binding. By contrast,
as Proposition 8 establishes, when types are perfectly persistent, a government that reveals itself
to be “weak” in the sense of having low political pressures reveals as well that it cannot impose a
retaliatory cost on a cheating government.
We turn now to the second possible range for the weak binding; speci…cally, we suppose that
governments agree to set a weak binding that is equal to or below the Nash tari¤ for the low type:

Given that the weak binding falls at or below the Nash tari¤s for both the low and

high types of government, a weak-binding equilibrium can exist only if both types of government
apply the tari¤

in all periods along the equilibrium path.

To examine the o¤-schedule incentive constraint, we begin with the short-term incentive to
cheat. The most attractive o¤-schedule deviation for a government with type
N(

is its Nash tari¤,
is thus (

It is direct to con…rm that the incentive to cheat is greatest for a government with the high

The ratchet e¤ect arises in dynamic contracting problems with incomplete information in which long-term contracts are infeasible. See, for example, Freixas, Guesnerie and Tirole (1985) and La¤ont and Tirole (1988).

Consider now the future value of cooperation. If a government cheats in period t, then in all
future periods governments apply their Nash tari¤s rather than the bound tari¤,

W.

In contrast

to our analysis of the repeated game with transitory shocks, we must now allow that the per-period
value of cooperation depends upon a government’s persistent type. In particular, when governments

since a government then

experiences a welfare loss on its export good when its trading partner applies Nash tari¤s.

which H L is su¢ ciently large that J( N (L); H) < Wx ( N (H); H) + Wx (1=6). The RHS of this inequality is the

28

Propositions 8 and 9 identify only a limited sense in which governments may cooperate in a
weak-binding equilibrium. As Proposition 8 indicates, governments may set the weak binding above
the Nash tari¤ of a government with a high type, but in this case the agreement simply induces
Nash tari¤s. Alternatively, as Proposition 9 con…rms, for some parameter regions, governments
can enforce a weak-binding equilibrium in which they set the weak binding at or below the Nash
tari¤ of a government with a low type. In this case, however, the applied tari¤ is always set at the
bound rate, and the applied tari¤ is strictly below the level that is e¢ cient when a single tari¤ is
applied (i.e., the applied tari¤ is below

E (E

)).

In the remainder of the paper, we consider ways in which this limitation might be overcome.
First, when a weak binding is used that exceeds the Nash tari¤ for a government with a low type,
such a government might recognize that, when it applies its Nash tari¤, it reveals that it is “weak”
and thus encourages the other government to cheat. This motivates consideration of a di¤erent
class of equilibria, in which all applied tari¤s at or below the weak binding do not necessarily
generate the same continuation path. In this class, we focus in the next subsection on pooling
equilibria, wherein the low- and high-types of governments apply the same tari¤ at all dates along
the equilibrium path.21 Second, we examine in this section an extreme case in which types are
perfectly persistent. In Section 6, we consider weak-binding equilibria in a more realistic model in
which types are imperfectly persistent. Third, in Section 7, we return to the dynamic game with
perfectly persistent shocks and consider a class of equilibria in which the weak binding descends
gradually over time as a function of the types revealed by applied tari¤s in early periods.22

5.3

Pooling Equilibria

We now assume that governments negotiate an agreement to use a weak binding,

W;

however,

we relax the second restriction imposed in our de…nition of a weak-binding equilibrium and now
allow that the continuation of play may depend on the particular way in which governments apply
tari¤s to satisfy the weak-binding obligation. In particular, one theme of our analysis above is that
a government may reveal itself to be weak (i.e., a low type) and incapable of e¤ective retaliation,
when it applies a tari¤ strictly below the weak binding. Rather than look weak and invite an
o¤-schedule deviation by its trading partner, a government with a low type might choose instead to
apply the bound tari¤, even when its optimal tari¤ is lower. When a government applies the bound
tari¤ whether its type is high or low, its type cannot be inferred; consequently, the other government
may hesitate to cheat with an o¤-schedule deviation, since it is possible that the retaliatory tari¤
21

Pooling often arises as well in dynamic contracting problems in which a ratchet e¤ect is present. See, for example,
Freixas, Guesnerie and Tirole (1985) and La¤ont and Tirole (1988).
22
A fourth approach would be to consider sophisticated carrot-stick punishment schemes. In such a scheme, the
punishment phase “re-starts" if a deviation occurs within that phase. In the present context, for su¢ ciently patient
governments, such schemes may deliver worse-than-Nash punishments. As discussed at the start of Section 4, however,
we do not pursue this approach here, since it seems unlikely that a breakdown in a cooperative trade agreement would
be consistent with the coordination of a sophisticated punishment path. We note that our association of Nash tari¤s
with the absence of cooperation is standard in the trade literature. The Nash tari¤s represent the non-cooperative
benchmark in most work that characterizes the value of a trade agreement; likewise, the Nash tari¤s are associated
with the breakdown of cooperation in most work that examines self-enforcing trade agreements.

29

would be the Nash tari¤ of a high-type government.
Re‡ecting this line of thought, we thus now analyze pooling equilibria, which are equilibria in
which in every period along the equilibrium path each government of each type applies the same
tari¤. We can understand pooling equilibria as being induced by a weak binding,

W,

if we assume

that each government of each type applies the bound tari¤ exactly, in order not to be perceived
as being weak. This interpretation is motivated in the preceding paragraph. Of course, pooling
equilibria can also be understood in terms of an agreement to use a strong binding. Emphasizing
the …rst interpretation, we refer to a pooling equilibrium in which governments apply the bound
tari¤

W

in all periods along the equilibrium path as a pooling equilibrium at the weak binding.

Consider now the o¤-schedule incentive constraint for a pooling equilibrium at the weak binding,
when the weak binding,

W,

W

satis…es

2(

N (L); N (H)).

Each government understands that if

it applies a tari¤ below the weak binding, then the other government will believe that it is weak.
This belief will encourage the other government to cheat in the following period and induce Nash
tari¤s for the remainder of time. Consequently, if a government applies a tari¤ below the weak
binding in period t, it should apply its Nash tari¤ in period t + 1 and thereafter. Likewise, each
government understands that if it applies a tari¤ in excess of the weak binding, then its action
will be interpreted as cheating, with the result being that both governments apply Nash tari¤s in
the next and all subsequent periods. Given this construction, the key o¤-schedule constraint is
that, whatever its type, a government must earn greater expected discounted welfare when both
governments cooperate and apply the bound tari¤,

W;

throughout time than when the government

cheats with an o¤-schedule deviation to its Nash tari¤ and thereby induces both governments to
apply Nash tari¤s in all future periods. Notice that a government with a high type thus contemplates
a deviation to a tari¤ that exceeds the bound rate (

N (H)

>

W)

and is in this sense a violation

whereas a government with a low type evaluates a deviation to a tari¤ that falls below the bound
rate (

N (L)

<

W)

and thereby signals weakness.

Formally, for a pooling equilibrium at the weak binding, the o¤-schedule constraint must hold
for both types of government and is given by (21). Above, we argue that this constraint binds …rst
for a high type of government, when

binding is

). As in our analysis of the optimal strong binding, when governments

anticipate that a single applied tari¤ will be applied in all periods along the equilibrium path, they
prefer that the applied tari¤ be the tari¤ that is e¢ cient for the expected type. We thus focus on
the o¤-schedule constraint when

W

E (E

Let us now examine the o¤-schedule constraint in more detail. For a government of type

As established in Proposition 1, the RHS of (25) is strictly positive. Notice that the RHS is
independent of the deviating government’s type and captures the expected welfare loss that the
deviating government experiences when the other government applies its Nash tari¤ rather than
the bound tari¤. Our next step is to understand how the LHS of (25) varies with :
W

Consider then how the incentive to cheat varies with the government’s type when

then the incentive to cheat for a government with the high type is approximately

This proposition illustrates one parameter region over which governments can support a pooling
equilibrium in which they always apply the tari¤ that is e¢ cient for the expected type.23 The
construction is not trivial, since both types of government have incentives to cheat.

6

Enforcement: Imperfectly Persistent Shocks

In the preceding two sections, we analyze the extreme cases in which governments privately observe
political-economic pressures that are either transitory or perfectly persistent. Building on this
analysis, we now consider a more realistic model in which governments’ types are imperfectly
persistent through time. When a government’s type exhibits imperfect persistence, its tari¤ in the
current period may reveal its current type and thereby information about its probable future type.

6.1

The Dynamic Game with Imperfectly Peristent Shocks

The dynamic game with imperfectly persistent shocks is informally described as follows. At the
start of the game, each government privately observes its current type, where types are independently distributed across governments and imperfectly persistent through time. As described below,
governments’ types evolve independently over time according to a Markov process. The game is
otherwise the same as those analyzed in the previous two sections. Thus, in any given period, governments simultaneously apply their tari¤s, each government has a private history which includes
its knowledge of its current type, and goverments share the public history of previous applied tari¤s.
Since governments’types exhibit some persistence over time, the game is a dynamic game.
A government’s type evolves over time according to a simple Markov process. For each government, if the government has the low (high) type in period t, then it has the high (low) type
in period t + 1 with probability

. We assume that

2 (0; 1=2), so that types exhibit positive

persistence through time. Notice that the repeated game with transitory shocks corresponds to a
setting in which

= 1=2 while the dynamic game with perfectly persistent types corresponds to

a situation in which

= 0.24 Since types evolve according to a Markov process, a government’s

23

Recall that
(1) > 0 holds if 7=4 H H L. Equivalently,
(1) > 0 holds if L L(H; 2=3). Recall as well
that our parameter restriction can be stated as L(H; H ) > L: Thus, for any H 2 (2=3; 1), there exist values for H
and L such that
(1) > 0 and our parameter restriction both hold.
24
When H = 1=2, the repeated game with transitory shocks generates the same distribution of types as does the
dynamic game with imperfectly persistent shocks when = 1=2.

32

knowledge of its own current type (belief as to the other government’s current type) su¢ ces for
forming an expectation as to its (the other government’s) type in the next period.
For our solution concept, we consider perfect bayesian equilibria (Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991)
in which governments use public strategies. A government uses a public strategy if in any period
its applied tari¤ depends only on the public history at that time and its payo¤-relevant private
information. Given our Markov assumption, a government’s payo¤-relevant private information at
date t is its current type. Following Athey and Bagwell (2008), we again refer to such re…ned equilibria as perfect public bayesian equilibria. In the dynamic game with imperfectly persistent types,
perfect public bayesian equilibria are de…ned in terms of the strategy that each government uses in
the dynamic game and the belief function that each government uses when making inferences about
the other government’s type. In a perfect public bayesian equilibrium, each government’s public
strategy must be sequentially rational, and its belief function must be bayesian where possible given
the public history of observed tari¤s and its understanding of the other government’s equilibrium
strategy and the underlying Markov process that governs the evolution of types. As before, we
assume that governments use ex ante symmetric strategies and thus restrict attention to symmetric
perfect public bayesian equilibria. In this section, we refer to symmetric perfect public bayesian
equilibria for the dynamic game with imperfectly persistent types as equilibria.
In the dynamic game with imperfectly persistent types, if in period t a government with one type
mimics the behavior that is prescribed in equilibrium for the government when it has the other type,
then the government has undertaken an on-schedule deviation. An o¤-schedule deviation occurs in
the dynamic game with imperfectly persistent types whenever a government applies a tari¤ in some
period t that is not prescribed under the equilibrium strategy for either type that the government
may have observed in period t. Even when a government sees that the other governments has
undertaken an o¤-schedule deviation, the former government’s beliefs as to the evolution over time
of the deviating government’s type must respect the Markov structure described above.25
Once again, we assume that governments negotiate a trade agreement at date zero, before they
learn their period-one types for the dynamic game. For simplicity, we assume that a government
receives the high type in period one with probability

H

= 1=2.26 We focus again on the possibility

of an agreement among governments to use a weak binding. In contrast to our …ndings for the
dynamic game with perfectly persistent types, we show that concerns about signaling “weakness”
will not undermine governments’willingness to apply tari¤s below the weak binding, if governments
are su¢ ciently patient, where the critical level of patience is higher when types are more persistent.

6.2

Weak-Binding Equilibria

As before, we de…ne a weak-binding equilibrium as an equilibrium in which there exists a weak
binding,

W,

such that (i) along the equilibrium path, governments apply tari¤s that are equal to

25
See Athey and Bagwell (2008) for formal de…nitions of equilibrium, on- and o¤-schedule deviations, and the
evolution of beliefs in a related dynamic game with imperfectly persistent types.

and (ii) at any period t, the applied tari¤s selected by governments are independent

As formalized in Propositions 8 and 9, for the dynamic game with perfectly persistent shocks,
weak-binding equilibria often fail to exist; in particular, they do not exist when the weak binding is

restriction. In that model, a government with a low type that goes below the bound rate and
applies its Nash tari¤ reveals its permanent type; consequently, it reveals as well that it would
apply the same tari¤ in future periods whether or not the other government goes on to cheat and
apply a tari¤ in excess of the binding. We expect this problem to be mitigated somewhat in the
dynamic game with imperfectly persistent shocks, since a government that has a low type in one
period may have a high type in later periods.
To explore this intuition, we assume that governments agree to use the optimal weak binding,
W,
A

and we analyze the associated o¤-schedule incentive constraints. Given our focus on weak-

binding equilibria, a government with a low type applies its Nash tari¤, and so a positive incentive
to cheat is present only for a government with a high type. As before, the incentive to cheat is given
as

(

W ; H)
A

N (H); H)

= Wx (

Wx (

W ; H).
A

The novel aspect of our analysis here concerns the

future value of cooperation. In a weak-binding equilibrium, governments’applied tari¤s reveal their
current types; hence, at the start of any period t, each government can look back at the applied
tari¤s in period t

1 and infer the type that the other government had in that period. Given

that types exhibit imperfect persistence, a government can use this inference to better forecast the
evolution of the other government’s type. In turn, this inference helps the government forecast the
expected discounted welfare loss that would be associated with a breakdown in cooperation. Thus,
when a government observes its own type and contemplates cheating in period t, its assessment of
the future value of cooperation depends on its type in period t and the type that it infers the other
government had in period t

1.

Our characterization of the future value of cooperation is facilitated by solving a four-by-four
recursive system for the values V

, where

2 fL; Hg,

But if cooperation were to break down, a

Intuitively, when both governments have the low type, they apply their Nash tari¤s whether or
not cooperation occurs, and so ALL = 0. Similarly, if both governments have the high type, then
they both apply

W
A

under cooperation and

N (H)

when cooperation breaks down, and so AHH

can be described in terms of joint welfare and is positive. If a government has a low type while
its trading partner has a high type, then the government values cooperation, since it applies the
same Nash tari¤ either way but faces a higher tari¤ on its export good when cooperation fails. It
follows that ALH > 0. If a government has a high type and its trading partner does not, then the
government enjoys a breakdown in cooperation: AHL < 0. Intuitively, the government then enjoys
applying its Nash tari¤ when cooperation fails and faces the same tari¤ on its exports whether or not
cooperation fails. Finally, we see from (27) that AHH = ALH + AHL , and thus that ALH > AHH :
Using ALL = 0 and AHH = ALH + AHL , we may solve (26) to get

Using (27), the solutions in (28) may be expressed in terms of the underlying welfare functions.
Notice that all four values are equal in the limiting case where shocks are transitory: V
AHH =[2(1

)] when

= 1=2. Under our assumption that

2 (0; 1=2), we can show that

VLH > VHH > VLL > VHL

(29)

Thus, the expected future value of cooperation is highest when in the previous period a government
had a low type while its trading partner had a high type. Intuitively, in that case, if types persist
and cooperation occurs, the government already applies its optimal tari¤ and also faces a belowNash tari¤ from its trading partner. At the other extreme, the expected future value of cooperation
is lowest when in the previous period a government had the high type and the other government

35

had the low type. Indeed, when

is su¢ ciently small so that types are unlikely to change across

periods, VHL < 0. Further, for all

2 (0; 1=2), VLH > VHH > VLL > 0.

We are now ready to consider the o¤-schedule constraint. As noted, in any period t, a government has a positive short-term incentive to cheat if and only if it has a high type. In period t,
the government also has inferred the type that its trading partner had in period t

1. Now, the

tari¤ that the trading partner applies in period t is independent of whether or not the government
cheats in period t. The government thus understands that a decision to cheat in period t a¤ects the
applied tari¤ of its trading partner starting in period t + 1. The government that is contemplating
cheating in period t thus must consider the future value of cooperation that cheating would sacri…ce
starting in period t + 1. Due to persistence, this value is a¤ected by the government’s inference as
to its trading partner’s type in period t

1.

For a government with a high type in period t that is contemplating cheating, there are thus

two cases. First, if the trading partner applied

is su¢ ciently close to 1=2, then this government would

perceive the value of cooperation to be positive. The value of cooperation is strictly increasing as

is strictly lower when governments’types are less persistent. Put di¤erently, it is easier to support
a weak-binding equilibrium when types are more transitory.
The remaining step is to address the existence of the critical discount factor. Our arguments
may be developed with reference to Figure 7. The horizontal line represents the incentive to cheat
for a government with a high type. To begin, we consider the limiting case where

this general way, we may construct the critical discount factor,

We may now summarize our …ndings in the following proposition:
Proposition 11: Consider the dynamic game with imperfectly persistent shocks. For all

approaches 1=2.

Governments can thus enforce a weak-binding equilibrium in which the weak binding is set at the
optimal weak binding if they are su¢ ciently patient, where greater patience is required when types
are more persistent. In particular, a government with a low type can then apply its Nash tari¤ and
reveal that it is weak without inducing the other government to cheat in the following period, since
the latter government recognizes that the former government will one day be strong again. When
is close to 1=2, types are essentially transitory, and our …ndings are similar to those derived for
the repeated game with transitory shocks. Likewise, when

is close to zero, types are essentially

permanent, and our …ndings are analogous to those derived for the dynamic game with perfectly
persistent shocks. Indeed, when

is close to zero, the critical discount factor is close to unity; thus,

in this case, governments can enforce a weak-binding equilibrium in which the weak binding is set
at the optimal weak binding if and only if they have approximately unlimited patience.
As Proposition 11 con…rms, for a given

2 (0; 1=2), if the discount factor falls below

W
A (

),

then there does not exist a weak-binding equilibrium that uses the optimal weak binding. As in
Proposition 7 for the repeated game with transitory shocks, we may then construct a weak-binding
equilibrium in which the weak binding is set at a level that is above the optimal weak binding. A
higher bound tari¤ rate reduces the incentive to cheat for a government with a high type, since
the higher bound enables such a government to apply a tari¤ closer to its Nash tari¤. Similarly,
if we …x any level of patience

2 (0; 1) and increase the level of persistence, then we encounter a

critical level of persistence such that governments can enforce a weak-binding equilibrium only if

they set the weak binding strictly above the optimal weak binding. The divergence between the
bound tari¤ and the applied tari¤ of a government with a low type increases as the tari¤ binding
is raised. The analysis here thus leads to the following prediction: when types are more persistent,
larger and more persistent divergences between applied and bound tari¤s may be observed.
For a …xed level of patience, if types are very persistent, even the “most-cooperative” weakbinding equilibrium o¤ers only a modest improvement on the Nash equilibrium. Intuitively, in this
case, when a government has a high type and infers that its trading partner’s type was low in
the previous period, this government cannot be deterred from cheating unless the bound tari¤ is
su¢ ciently close to its Nash tari¤. This observation captures one sense in which the enforcement
problem highlighted in our analysis of the dynamic game with perfectly persistent shocks exerts an
in‡uence as well in the dynamic game with imperfectly persistent shocks. If governments were to
face such a situation, it is conceivable that they might attempt to enforce a pooling equilibrium in
which the applied tari¤ always equals the bound rate. Their behavior would then be analagous to
that described in Proposition 10 for the dynamic game with perfectly persistent types.
We next consider the role of private information for the …ndings in Proposition 11. Under the
alternative assumption that types are publicly observed, a weak-binding equilibrium with
38

W

=

W
A

exists if and only if a government would not gain from an o¤-schedule deviation when its current
type is high and the current type of its trading partner is low. The critical discount factor is thus
de…ned by

(

W ; H)
A

= VHL < RHS( ; ), where the inequality uses (29) and (31). Intuitively,

if types are publicly observed, a government may observe that its trading partner is weak in the
current period; however, if types are privately observed, a government can only infer that its
trading partner was weak in the preceding period. When types are imperfectly persistent, the
trading partner’s expected future retaliatory capacity is smaller in the former scenario. We can
thus show that the critical discount factor is higher if government types are publicly observable.28
In this sense, greater transparency as to governments’preferences may make cooperation harder.

Gradualism and Dynamic Screening

In this section, we consider again the dynamic game with perfectly persistent shocks; however, we
now consider a new class of equilibria, in which governments reach successive agreements over time
with regard to bound tari¤ rates. In particular, we allow that the tari¤s applied by governments
in the course of satisfying the weak binding of the …rst agreement may a¤ect the weak bindings
that governments negotiate in the second agreement. We thus refer to such equilibria as “historydependent weak-binding equilibria.”Allowing for any discount factor, we construct an equilibrium
of this kind that o¤ers higher-than-Nash welfare for both governments for every possible pair of
types that governments may have. The equilibrium entails dynamic screening and is suggestive of
a new information-based theory of gradualism in trade agreements.
We also consider the dynamic game with perfectly persistent shocks in Section 5. We observe
there that weak-binding equilibria partition the public history into “good”and “bad”histories and
thus allow for limited history dependence. We now allow for a small degree of additional history
dependence. To this end, we consider the possibility of an equilibrium that can be described
in terms of a weak binding for period one,

As before, if a government applies a tari¤ in excess of its weak binding, then in all future periods
governments abandon cooperation and apply Nash tari¤s. Thus, if either government’s …rst-period
applied tari¤ exceeds the …rst-period weak binding, then governments revert to Nash play in the
second and all later periods; likewise, a reversion to Nash play begins in period t + 1 if in any period
t

2 a government applies a tari¤ in excess of its induced second-period weak binding.
We may interpret the …rst-period and induced second-period weak bindings as corresponding

weak binding,

W,

for both governments in period one. The second agreement is negotiated at the

end of period one and thus after the public observation of period-one applied tari¤s. If governments
apply di¤erent tari¤s in period one, then they may negotiate di¤erent weak bindings in the periodtwo agreement. In particular, if governments have di¤erent types, then it is possible that they both
satisfy the weak-binding requirement in period one and yet apply di¤erent tari¤s in that period.
While the de…nition of a weak-binding equilibrium would require that future applied tari¤s are
independent of the particular ways in which governments satisfy their …rst-period weak binding,
we introduce here some additional history dependence and allow that the induced second-period
weak bindings may re‡ect the particular ways in which governments satisfy their …rst-period weak
binding. In other words, di¤erent “good” histories may now be associated with di¤erent induced
weak bindings in the second agreement.
For the dynamic game with perfectly persistent shocks, we de…ne a history-dependent weakbinding equilibrium as an equilibrium in which there exists

With the notion of a history-dependent weak-binding equilibrium, we thus allow that …rst-period

tari¤s a¤ect the determination of the induced second-period weak bindings and thereby the tari¤s

that are applied in future periods: In e¤ect, starting in the second period, government behavior
must be described by a weak-binding equilibrium, once that concept is generalized slightly to allow
for asymmetric weak bindings. But the second-period weak bindings themselves represent a new
channel for history dependence.
To understand the value of a history-dependent weak-binding equilibrium, it is helpful to recall
the limited scope for cooperation in a weak-binding equilibrium when types are perfectly persistent.
In such an equilibrium, a single weak binding,

40

This intuition could be formalized in several ways. Here, we construct a simple history-dependent
weak-binding equilibrium in which governments achieve greater-than-Nash welfare regardless of
their types and for any positive discount factor. In the constructed equilibrium, the …rst-period

all possible types that governments may realize, each government enjoys strictly higher discounted
welfare in the constructed history-dependent weak-binding equilibrium than they would were they to
apply Nash tari¤ s in all periods.
The full details of the proof are provided in the Appendix.
Proposition 12 captures a form of dynamic screening. With their …rst-period applied tari¤s,
41

governments reveal their types in period one. They then agree upon new weak bindings in period
two which re‡ect this information. The constructed equilibrium can be interpreted as a form of
gradualism in trade agreements.29 The …rst-period agreement uses a single and high weak binding.
After observing the tari¤s that are applied under this agreement, and making the appropriate
inferences, governments then negotiate a new agreement in period two in which the weak bindings
are further lowered. The negotiated reduction in the weak binding is greater if a government has a
low type and thus applies a …rst period tari¤ that is strictly below the …rst-period weak binding.
All governments apply their bound tari¤s in the second period.
An interesting implication of the constructed equilibrium is thus that the extent of “binding
overhang” may be greater in early negotiation rounds. This implication suggests, for example,
that the degree of binding overhang may have diminished over time for original GATT members.
Given that many developing countries joined the WTO as part of the most recent (Uruguay) round
of negotiations, this implication also suggests a potential interpretation for the observation that
the extent of binding overhang is currently greater among developing countries.30 At the same
time, we caution that the constructed equilibrium has not been shown to be the most-cooperative
history-dependent weak-binding equilibrium.

Conclusion

We consider the design of self-enforcing trade agreements among governments with private information about the political pressures that they face. By limiting tari¤s, a trade agreement can
reduce the standard ine¢ ciencies that are associated with the terms-of-trade externality. Further,
if a trade agreement allows governments some discretion when setting tari¤s, then it can facilitate
better matching between a government’s applied tari¤s and its political pressures. To explore these
roles for trade agreements, we examine a static model and a sequence of dynamic models. The
dynamic models are distinguished by the extent to which the private information that governments
possess is persistent through time. In this context, we argue that an agreement to use a weak
binding o¤ers important advantages over other alternatives. We note, though, that governments
may hesitate to fully exploit the bene…cial “downward discretion” that such an agreement allows,
if private information is persistent relative to the patience of governments. In particular, if a government is perceived as “weak,”then it cannot threaten e¤ective retaliation; thus, an agreement to
apply the tari¤s induced by the optimal weak binding may not be self-enforcing. We also consider
some ways in which governments might respond to the associated “ratchet e¤ect.” For example,
our analysis suggests a new information-based theory of gradualism in trade agreements.
Several important extensions await. First, we consider a model in which each country imports
one good and exports another good, whereas in reality countries import and export many goods.
29

An alternative interpretation is that governments have no agreement in period one and apply their tari¤s with
an understanding that their period-one choices may impact the bindings that are negotiated in period two as part of
a trade agreement.
30
For an empirical analysis of binding overhang, see Bchir, Sebastien and Laborde (2005).

42

Most of our results extend to the multi-good context in a straightforward fashion.31 In some cases,
though, the multi-good extension introduces new and interesting considerations. In particular,
it would be interesting to examine the possibility of pooling equilibria in the dynamic game with
perfectly persistent shocks, when multiple goods are traded. When governments attempt to use the
applied tari¤s induced by the optimal weak binding, a ratchet e¤ect again arises if a government has
a low type for a su¢ cient number of its goods; however, in the multi-good case, a government may
be able to hide its weakness to a su¢ cient degree, by pooling and applying the bound tari¤ rate
for many but not all products. Second, in the two-type framework analyzed in this paper, there is
little scope for analyzing trade agreements with weak bindings (downward discretion) and safeguard
rules (upward discretion). Important future work might consider a model with more than two types
where the types exhibit some persistence over time. Such a framework might also o¤er insight with
respect to WTO remedies, which occur along the equilibrium path when a government exercises
upward discretion. Finally, an important task for future work is to characterize and interpret the
optimal form of gradualism in self-enforcing trade agreements among governments with persistent
private information. An analysis of this kind could provide an interpretation for “foot-dragging”
and other dynamic bargaining tactics that are observed in GATT/WTO negotiations.

We now prove part (i). Referring to Figure 2, given that H and L are such that L(H; 1) > L > LN (H),
they reside in Region A. Since L(H; H ) strictly increases as H rises, there exists eH 2 (1=3; 1) such that

Consider next part (ii). Referring again to Figure 2, given that H and L are such that LN (H) > L, they
reside in Region B. As before, since L(H; H ) strictly increases as H rises, there exists eH 2 (1=3; 1) such

Proof of Proposition 6: Assume (12) holds. We now de…ne a relaxed program:
max EJ( ( ); ) s.t. (H)
( )

(L) and Wx ( (L); L)

Wx ( (H); L):

To see that this program is a relaxation of the second-best program, recall (6) implies the applied tari¤
schedule is nondecreasing and note the relaxed program omits the constraint Wx ( (H); H) Wx ( (L); H).
We solve the relaxed program by establishing three claims. We then verify that the omitted constraint is
automatically satis…ed and thus that we have solved the second-best program as well.
Our …rst claim is as follows: When (12) holds, at any solution ( ) to the relaxed program, Wx ( (L); L) =
Wx ( (H); L). To establish this claim, suppose Wx ( (L); L) > Wx ( (H); L) at a solution to the relaxed
program. Under this supposition, (H) > (L) is necessary. Now, if (L) 6= E (L), then we could move the
applied tari¤ for the low type slightly towards E (L) and achieve a higher value for expected joint welfare,
while still satisfying all of the constraints of the relaxed program. Thus, (L) = E (L) is necessary. A
similar argument applies for the high type. Thus, under our supposition, a solution to the relaxed program
must satisfy (L) = E (L) and (H) = E (H). But this leads to a contradiction, since the e¢ cient tari¤
schedule fails to satisfy the relaxed program’s incentive-compatibility constraint when (12) holds.
Our second claim is slightly stronger: When (12) holds, at any solution ( ) to the relaxed program,
Wx ( (L); L) = Wx ( (H); L) and (H) > (L). To establish this claim, we need only show that a solution
to the relaxed program cannot set (H) = (L). The constant tari¤ schedule that maximizes expected
joint welfare entails (H) = (L) = E (E ). As established in Proposition 3, expected joint welfare would
be higher if (H) = E (H) > N (L) = (L), where the inequality follows from our parameter restriction.
These applied tari¤s satisfy the constraints of the relaxed program.
We come now to our third claim: When (12) holds, at any solution ( ) to the relaxed program,
E
(L) < (L) < N (L) and E (H) < (H): To establish this claim, we begin by using our second claim
to see that a solution must satisfy Wx ( (L); L) = Wx ( (H); L) and (H) > N (L) > (L). Thus, (H)
must be the “‡ipside” of (L) along the (concave) function Wx ( ; L). Let E (L) be the ‡ipside of E (L):
Thus, Wx ( E (L); L) = Wx ( E (L); L) and E (L) > N (L) > E (L). When (12) holds, Wx ( E (L); L) <
Wx ( E (H); L), and so E (L) > E (H) > N (L), where the last inequality uses our parameter restriction.
When (12) holds, we now establish that a solution to the relaxed program must satisfy (L) > E (L).
Suppose …rst that a solution entails (L) < E (L). Then (H) must be the ‡ipside of (L), and so
(H) > E (L) > E (H) follows. Starting here, expected joint welfare could be strictly increased by raising
the tari¤ assigned to the low type while likewise slightly decreasing the ‡ipside tari¤ that is assigned to
the high type. For small movements of this kind, both tari¤s move toward their e¢ cient levels, and so
expected joint welfare is strictly higher. Since these adjusted tari¤s also satisfy the constraints of the relaxed
E
program, we conclude that (L)
(L). Suppose second that a solution entails (L) = E (L) and
thus (H) = E (L). Now consider again a slight increase in the tari¤ assigned to the low type with a
corresponding slight decrease in the ‡ipside tari¤ that is assigned to the high type. For a small change, the
change in the low-type tari¤ has no …rst-order e¤ect on expected joint welfare, since the tari¤ for the low
type is initially set at the e¢ cient level for this type. The change in the tari¤ for the high type, however,
generates a …rst-order increase in expected welfare, since the tari¤ for the high type is initially above the
level that is e¢ cient for this type. We thus conclude that (L) > E (L).
When (12) holds, we next establish that a solution to the relaxed program must satisfy (H) > E (H).
Suppose …rst that N (L) < (H) < E (H). Let (L) be the (lower) ‡ipside of (H), in that (L) < (H)
and Wx ( (L); L) = Wx ( (H); L). From here, we may consider a slight increase in the tari¤ for the high

46

type that is accompanied by a ‡ipside decrease in the tari¤ for the low type. The modi…ed tari¤s continue
to satisfy the constraints of the relaxed program. They also generate strictly higher expected joint welfare,
E
since for each type the tari¤ is moved in the direction of the e¢ cient tari¤. We conclude that (H)
(H).
E
E
E
Suppose second that a solution entails (H) =
(H) and thus (L) =
(H) where
(H) is the (lower)
‡ipside of E (H). From here, we may increase slightly the tari¤ for the high type while likewise decreasing
slightly the (lower) ‡ipside tari¤ for the low type. The former adjustment has no …rst-order e¤ect on expected
joint welfare, since the tari¤ for the high type is initially set at the e¢ cient level for this type. The latter
adjustment, however, generates a …rst-order increase in expected joint welfare, since the tari¤ for the low
type is initially above the level that is e¢ cient for this type. We thus conclude that (H) > E (H). This
completes the proof of our third claim.
We establish in our third claim that the solution to the relaxed program satsi…es the inequalities stated
in the proposition. We now show that the solution to the relaxed program satis…es the omitted incentive constraint and thus is also the solution to the second-best program. Recall from our …rst claim
that the solution to the relaxed program satsi…es Wx ( (L); L) = Wx ( (H); L) and (H) > (L). Thus,
Wx ( (H); H) = Wx ( (H); L) + (H L)f ( (H)) = Wx ( (L); L) + (H L)f ( (H)) = Wx ( (L); H) + (H
L)[f ( (H)) f ( (L))] > Wx ( (L); H); where the inequality follows since H > L, (H) > (L) and f 0 > 0.
The omitted incentive constraint is thus satis…ed. Finally, as we establish above and as Figure 3 illustrates,
L(H; 1) lies strictly above LF B (H) which in turn lies strictly above L(H; 1=2). It follows that there exists
some critical eH 2 (1=2; 1) such that for all H 2 (eH ; 1) there exists values for L and H that satisfy (12)
and our parameter restriction. QED

32

Observe that h ( ; ) = 4 ALH (1

1) + ALH .
Since AHL < 0, h (1=2; 0) > 0. Notice also that h (1=2; 1) = AHH > 0. Since h (1=2; ) is linear in , we conclude
that h (1=2; ) > 0 for all 2 [0; 1], and it thus follows that h ( ; ) > 0 for all 2 [0; 1=2] and 2 [0; 1].

h ( ; ) < 0 for all 2 [0; 1=2]. Given that h (0; ) > 0 = h (1=2; ), we could then conclude that h ( ; ) > 0

Proof of Proposition 12: To begin, consider any period t 2 and suppose that a government has a high
type. First, suppose that the government and its trading partner have both behaved as high types in all
previous periods (i.e., each government applied N (H) in period one and N (H)
H in all subsequent
periods). In period t, the most attractive deviation for the government is to cheat by applying the tari¤
N
(H). It then enjoys a one-period gain of ( N (H)
H ; H) and triggers a reversion to Nash tari¤s in
all future periods. Given that the trading partner is believed to have a high type, the o¤-schedule constraint
can be written as ( N (H)
( N (H)

The LHS and RHS of (38) are zero when H = 0; further, the derivative of the LHS with respect to H is
zero at H = 0, while for > 0 the derivative of the RHS with respect to H is positive at H = 0. We
thus conclude that (38) holds for H > 0 su¢ ciently small.
Second, suppose that the government has behaved as a high type in all previous periods, and that its
trading partner has behaved as a low type in all previous periods (i.e., the government applied N (H) in
N
period one and N (H)
(L) in period one
H in all subsequent periods, and the trading partner applied
N
and
(L)
in
all

periods).

H is zero at
H = 0, while for
We thus conclude that (39) holds for H > 0 and L > 0 su¢ ciently small.
We note that exactly analogous arguments apply for any period t 2 when the government has a low
type and has behaved accordingly in all previous periods, while its trading partner has a low or high type
and has behaved accordingly in all previous periods as well.
For t 2, suppose next that a government has a high type and that its partner behaved as a high type
in period one (i.e., applied N (H)) but in some later period deviated by applying a tari¤ below its induced
second-period weak binding (i.e., below N (H)
H ). At this point, play has moved o¤ the equilibrium
path, and for simplicity we may assume that the government has “passive beliefs” and continues to believe
that its trading partner has a high type. Given this state of play, we may specify the equilibrium strategy

48

so that a trading partner with a high type applies a tari¤ equal to its induced second-period weak binding
in period t and thereafter, provided that the government continues to meet its induced second-period weak
binding. Given its belief and understanding of the equilibrium strategy, the relevant o¤-schedule constraint
for the government is again described by (38), which we know holds for H > 0 su¢ ciently small. A similar
argument applies if a government has a high type and its trading partner behaved as a low type in period one
(i.e., applied N (L)) but in some later period deviated by applying a tari¤ below its induced second-period
weak binding (i.e., below N (L)
L ). In this case, we refer to (39) and conclude that the government will
not deviate for H > 0 and L > 0 su¢ ciently small. Likewise, for t 2, if a government has a low type
and its partner behaved as a low (high) type in period one and then later deviated by applying a tari¤ below
its induced second-period weak binding, then the government will not deviate from applying a tari¤ equal
to its induced second-period weak binding, for H > 0 and L > 0 su¢ ciently small.
For t 2, another possibility is that the trading partner applied an equilibrium tari¤ in period one (either
N
(L) or N (H)) and later deviated by applying a tari¤ above its induced second-period weak binding. The
government’s best choice is then to revert to its Nash tari¤s, since equilibrium strategies now require that
its trading partner apply Nash tari¤s in all remaining periods independent of the government’s behavior.
For t 2, a …nal possibility is that the trading partner deviated to a non-Nash tari¤ in period one. If
the trading partner applied a …rst-period tari¤ in excess of N (H), then the government anticipates that
its partner will apply Nash tari¤s in all future periods, independent of the government’s behavior. The
government’s best choice is then to apply its Nash tari¤ in all future periods. If the trading partner applied
a …rst-period tari¤ below N (H) but di¤erent from N (L), then we are o¤ the equilibrium path and may
assume that the government believes its partner has the low type. Given this state of play, we may specify
the equilibrium strategy so that a trading partner with a low type applies a tari¤ equal to its induced secondperiod weak binding, N (L)
L , in period 2 and thereafter, provided that the government continues to
meet its induced second-period weak binding. Given its belief and understanding of the equilibrium strategy,
the relevant o¤-schedule constraint for the government with a high type is again given by (39), which holds
for H > 0 and L > 0 su¢ ciently small. A similar argument applies if the government has a low type.
We now roll back to the …rst period. Whatever its type, a government applies its Nash tari¤ in equilibrium
in period one; thus, any deviation lowers its …rst-period welfare. If the deviation exceeds the …rst-period
weak binding, then it triggers Nash reversion and also lowers the government’s welfare in future periods,
for H > 0 and L > 0 su¢ ciently small. The gain to the government of applying its Nash tari¤s in
future periods is second-order in size while the cost to the government of the application of Nash tari¤s
by its trading partner is …rst-order in size. If the deviation is below the …rst-period weak binding, then
a government with a low type does not alter future play, while a government with a high type induces a
lower second-period weak binding than it would have otherwise and thus gains less under cooperation in the
future. Such a government might then apply its Nash tari¤ and cheat in the future; however, in that event, it
would have done better applying its Nash tari¤ in all periods (including t = 1), and for H > 0 and L > 0
su¢ ciently small the equilibrium payo¤s to such a government are higher yet. Finally, if a government with
a low type mimics the high type by applying N (H), it can apply N (L) rather than N (L)
L in all
future periods. The discounted future gain is second-order in size, though, for L > 0 su¢ ciently small.
Finally, we note that the constructed equilibrium generates greater discounted welfare for governments,
regardless of their types, than they receive under Nash play. This follows since, for any pair of types and
starting at Nash tari¤s, each government enjoys a …rst-order gain from a small reduction in the tari¤ of its
trading partner and experiences only a second-order loss from a small reduction in its own tari¤. QED
