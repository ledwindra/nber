To Cut or Not to Cut? On the Impact of Corporate Taxes on Employment and Income

ABSTRACT
Do corporate tax increases destroy jobs? And do corporate tax cuts boost employment?
Answering these questions has proved empirically challenging. We propose an identification
strategy that exploits variation in corporate income tax rates across U.S. states. Comparing
contiguous counties straddling state borders over the period 1970 to 2010, we find that increases
in corporate tax rates lead to significant reductions in employment and wage income, while
corporate tax cuts only boost economic activity if implemented during recessions. Our spatialdiscontinuity approach permits a causal interpretation of these findings by both establishing a
plausible counterfactual and overcoming biases resulting from the fact that tax changes are often
prompted by changes in economic conditions.

1. Introduction
Despite the recent enactment of a large cut in the federal corporate tax rate, 1 the effects that
corporate taxes have on economic activity remains controversial. Academic studies, for example,
have found mixed evidence on how companies respond to changes in corporate tax rates, 2 while
opinion among public commentators appears starkly divided. This controversy in large part
stems from the fact that the effects of corporate tax changes are so difficult to measure
empirically.
The challenges are twofold. First, changes in tax policy are unlikely to be random and instead
may themselves be influenced by prevailing economic conditions and other factors. For example,
governments may cut taxes in the hope of stimulating sluggish growth. As a result, observed
correlations between changes in tax policy and ex post economic outcomes will, to some
unknown extent, reflect unobserved or omitted variation in economic conditions. Compounding
this problem is the fact that macroeconomic time-series are relatively short and so typically cover
few policy changes. This means that disentangling the effects of a given tax change from the
confounding effects of other events that coincide with it is difficult. Moreover, tax reform at the
federal level often involves highly complex pieces of legislation affecting numerous aspects of
the tax code, making it nearly impossible to evaluate the effects attributable to a change in the
corporate tax rate, while holding all else equal.
The second empirical challenge is that we do not observe counterfactual outcomes. That is,
even if a tax change was truly random, we do not know how outcomes such as employment and
income would have evolved had the tax change not occurred. The absence of a counterfactual

1

Among its many provisions, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 cut the statutory federal corporate income tax rate
from 35% to 21%.
2
For example, Mertens and Ravn (2013) find that federal corporate tax cuts have significant effects on aggregate
investment, but not on employment, while Hassett and Hubbard (2002) conclude that most studies find limited
effects of federal corporate tax changes on investment. At the state level, Giroud and Rauh (2017) find notable
effects of corporate tax changes on employment. We further review the literature below.

means that it is impossible to measure the impact of changes in tax policy without imposing
further assumptions on the behavior of the economic variables of interest.
We propose an empirical strategy designed to address these identification challenges. Our
strategy has two key elements. First, we focus on individual U.S. states rather than the federal
level. In contrast to federal corporate tax rates, which change only rarely, 3 changes in state-level
corporate taxes are plentiful: we count 250 changes in state corporate income tax rates from 1970
to 2010.
The second element of our empirical strategy is designed to minimize the effects of
confounding variation in economic conditions as much as possible. To this end, we exploit the
fact that a state’s tax jurisdiction stops at its border. This suggests that when a state undertakes a
corporate tax change, its neighboring states, which arguably share similar economic conditions
but where taxes haven’t changed, might provide a suitable “control group” against which to
measure the effects of the tax change. To get as close to a plausible counterfactual as possible,
however, our tests compare not neighboring states but rather contiguous counties located on
either side of a state border. 4 Because of their proximity to each other, these neighboring counties
are likely to be experiencing similar local economic conditions prior to one them being affected
by a tax change – and indeed, our tests validate that this “parallel trends” assumption holds in the
data. Thus, by comparing outcomes in the “treated” county to its neighboring control county on
the other side of the state border, we can effectively remove the biasing influence of otherwise
unobservable variation in local economic conditions. Doing so allows us isolate the effects
specifically attributable to the tax change. Essentially, our strategy is therefore a standard diff-indiff approach that exploits a spatial discontinuity in tax policy for identification purposes.

3

Since 1970, there have been only four major changes in the top federal corporate income tax rate: in 1979 (from
48% to 46%), in 1986 (from 46% to 34%), in 1993 (from 34% to 35%), and in 2018 (from 35% to 21%).
4
Several prior studies have implemented the border-county methodology in other contexts, including Holmes
(1998), Huang (2008), Dube, Lester, and Reich (2010), Heider and Ljungqvist (2015), and Hagedorn et al. (2016).

2

Our estimates suggest that a one percentage point corporate tax increase (cut) leads to
employment in the affected county falling (rising) by about 0.2 percent and total wage income
falling (rising) by about 0.3 percent (as measured relative to the neighboring county across the
border). 5 Interestingly, we find evidence of asymmetric effects: tax increases are uniformly
harmful, with point estimates similar in magnitude to those mentioned above for the symmetric
specification. Our estimates for the effects on tax cuts, on the other hand, are not in general
statistically significant. The one exception is when tax cuts are implemented during a recession;
in this case, tax cuts lead to a sizeable positive response in both employment and wage income.
The latter finding suggests that corporate tax cuts, when used counter-cyclically, may potentially
be an effective policy tool in stimulating employment and income during economic downturns.
While a key strength of our empirical strategy is that treated and control border counties
share similar local economic conditions and trends, this fact also raises a potential identification
concern: tax changes on one side of the border could potentially trigger changes in the behavior
of firms or households on the other. For example, since we find that tax increases reduce wage
income, this could spill over to control counties to the extent that affected households spend less
money not just at home but also in neighboring counties. This type of “household spending
spillover” would attenuate the estimated effects, as the tax increase would hurt both the treated
and the control county. Changes in corporate behavior (“corporate spillovers”), on the other
hand, might amplify the estimated effects. For example, firms located in treated counties might
shift operations to a control county to avoid a tax increase. This would cause economic activity
to rise in control counties while falling in treated counties, thus amplifying the estimated effects.
We test for whether such spillovers are likely to be present, and if so, whether they attenuate
or amplify our estimates. Our tests are based on the observation that cross-border spillovers, if

Information on other variables that might be of interest, such as investment, is not available at the county level.

present, will be stronger in control border counties and then dissipate the further we move into
the interior of the control state. 6 We find no evidence of such geographic patterns, which gives us
confidence that our estimates are unlikely to be biased due to household spending or corporate
spillovers. This suggests that control border counties on average remain on their pre-treatment
trend even after a tax change in a neighboring state. They hence provide a plausible set of
counterfactuals for how economic conditions would have evolved in treated counties had they
not been subject to a tax change, thus supporting a causal interpretation of our results.
Our findings survive many other robustness checks. For example, our results are unchanged
if we control for local industry-level shocks; remove from the sample “influential” counties that
account for more than 10% of a state’s population; restrict the analysis to “close” border-county
pairs, whose geographic midpoints are no more than 20 miles apart; focus only on corporate tax
changes that do not coincide with other notable state-level policy changes; or restrict the sample
to border county pairs with similar pre-treatment tax rates.
Our setting also permits us to study the heterogeneous impact of corporate tax changes. One
interesting result to emerge from this analysis is that tax increases have more harmful effects in
states that, prior to the tax increase, have low corporate tax rates. This is consistent with the
notion that, prior to the tax increase, more tax-sensitive economic activity endogenously locates
in such low-tax states. Thus, when a tax increase does occur, its effects are more harmful. To our
knowledge, this type of non-linearity has not previously been documented.
Our paper contributes to the literature on the effects of tax policy on economic activity going
back to Hall and Jorgensen (1967). Within this literature, much empirical work on how state
taxes affect economic activity has focused on personal (as opposed to corporate) taxes, starting

For example, if distance matters in firms’ decisions where to relocate operations in response to a corporate tax
increase, one would expect control border counties to be disproportionately impacted relative to “hinterland”
counties in the control state.

with earlier studies by Helms (1985) and Mofidi and Stone (1990), to more recent papers by
Reed and Rogers (2004), Reed (2008), and Gale, Krupkin, and Rueben (2015), to name but a
few. 7 Two particularly relevant recent studies that focus on state-level corporate taxes are Suarez
Serrato and Zidar (2016) and Giroud and Rauh (2017). 8 The former rely on state-level corporate
tax changes to structurally estimate a spatial equilibrium model of firm and worker location
choices, finding that approximately a third of corporate tax incidence is borne by workers. 9
Giroud and Rauh (2017) use establishment-level data to study the reaction of large multi-state
firms (those with at least 100 employees) to changes in state corporate taxes, estimating that
employment and establishment counts have corporate tax elasticities of -0.4. On the whole, our
estimates are quite similar to theirs, with differences likely due to differing methodologies.
Methodologically, our paper belongs to a growing literature that uses diff-in-diff or
instrumental-variables estimators to study the effects of fiscal policy at the state level. 10 The
strength of our research design is that allows us to run a relatively clean experiment. However,
we caution against naïvely extrapolating our estimates to assess the possible impact of a federal
corporate tax change. For one, tax changes at the federal level would induce general equilibrium
effects that are essentially held constant in our local comparison of border-county pairs.
Nonetheless, we believe that our results remain qualitatively useful in the context of the broader
debate about corporate tax reform: in essence, our key finding is that companies appear to be
7

There is also a voluminous literature on the economic effects of federal taxes. Studies with a particular focus on
identification generally rely on either SVARs, as in Blanchard and Perotti (2002) and Mountford and Uhlig (2009),
or “narrative identification,” as in Romer and Romer (2010), Mertens and Ravn (2013) and Zidar (2018). Of these
only Mertens and Ravn (2013) study corporate taxes. For alternative approaches, see Hassett and Hubbard (2002)
and Yagan (2015). Yet another camp uses cross-country data. See Kneller, Bleaney, and Gemmell (1999), Lee and
Gordon (2005), Djankov et al. (2010), and Hassett and Mathura (2015).
8
Other relevant papers include Goolsbee and Maydew (2001), who investigate how changes in state apportionment
formulae affect employment; Chirinko and Wilson (2008), who find that more manufacturing establishments locate
on the side of the state border with a lower user cost of capital state due to favorable investment tax credits; Felix
and Hines (2009), who evaluate the effect of state corporate taxes on unionized workers’ wages; and Moretti and
Wilson (2017), who study how higher state corporate taxes induce migration of star scientists.
9
Using data from Germany, Siegloch, Fuest, and Peichl (2018) estimate an incidence rate close to 50%.
10
Recent examples focusing on government spending shocks include: Chodorow-Reich et al. (2012), Clemens and
Miran (2012), Nakamura and Steinsson (2014), Fishback and Kachanovskaya (2015), and Shoag (2015).

highly responsive to changes in corporate taxes. Our methodology allows us to more confidently
attribute these responses specifically to changes in corporate tax rates rather than other
confounding factors. Since we are able to identify these strong responses relatively cleanly, our
analysis suggests that companies are indeed highly sensitive to corporate tax incentives.
2. State Corporate Income Taxes
Most states tax corporate activities within their borders, usually by taxing profits. 11 A firm’s
state of incorporation (often, Delaware) is irrelevant for state tax purposes. Instead, firms are
taxed in every state they have “nexus” with – i.e., where they have sales, employees, or property.
This means that a corporate income tax change in a state will affect all taxable corporate
economic activity in that state, regardless of where the firms active in a state are themselves
incorporated or headquartered. 12 State taxes are a meaningful part of corporations’ overall tax
burden. Heider and Ljungqvist (2015) estimate that in recent decades state taxes account for 21%
of total income taxes paid by the average publicly traded firm in the U.S.
We compile data on state-level corporate income tax rates from several sources. For the years
1969 to 1988, we collect data from the State Tax Handbook, published annually by Commerce
Clearing House. For 1989-2010, we use the information listed in Appendices A and B of Heider
and Ljungqvist (2015). Throughout the analysis, we focus on changes in the top statutory
marginal tax rate. This approach is appropriate in our context as states either have a flat
corporate tax rate structure or tend to charge the top rate on even relatively low levels of income
(say, $25,000). 13

11

The exceptions, as of 2010, are OH, TX, and WA, which use a gross receipts tax assessed on revenue rather than
on income, and NV, SD, and WY, which did not levy either type of corporate tax. Throughout the paper, we restrict
our analysis to mainland states, including DC.
12
Not all economic activity is carried out inside entities subject to state corporate income tax. Other business forms
such as sole proprietors and most LLCs, S-Corps, and partnerships are taxed at the personal (rather than corporate)
level. As detailed below, we exploit this heterogeneity in several of our tests.
13
In 2010, the highest corporate income tax bracket sets in at no more than $100,000 in 38 of the 44 states
(including DC) that impose a corporate income tax.

6

2.1 Variation in State Corporate Income Taxes
There is substantial variation in state corporate income taxes over time. To illustrate general
trends, Figure 1 plots the average tax rate over time, along with bands representing the 20th to
80th percentile range. Averaged across the states, tax rates increased from 5.1% in 1970 and have
since plateaued at around 7%.
We identify 135 tax increases in 43 states (including DC) and 115 tax cuts in 32 states from
1970 to 2010. 14 Table 1, Panel A reports summary statistics. The mean tax increase measures 127
basis points, a 21% increase from a year earlier. The median tax increase is 100 basis points and
the standard deviation is 115 basis points. The mean tax cut measures 68 basis points, an 8%
reduction from a year earlier. The median tax cut is 50 basis points and the standard deviation is
74 basis points.
Figure 2 shows the distribution of corporate income tax changes over time. The pace of tax
increases has slowed over time, while tax cuts have followed a hump-shaped pattern.
2.2 Coincident State-level Policy Changes
Like every state-level diff-in-diff, our identification strategy invites an important potential
concern: corporate tax changes may systematically coincide with other state-level policy changes
that affect economic activity. This would confound our estimates by making it difficult to isolate
the effects of corporate taxes as distinct from the effects of other policy programs. To see if this
is the case, we collect data on state-level policies that are likely to impact economic activity.
Specifically, we collect information on the initiation of state incentive programs providing tax
credits for either investment, R&D, or job creation and on changes in state taxes on bank profits
(which Smolyansky (2018) shows affect credit supply and real economic activity).
According to Table 1, Panel B, very few of the state corporate income tax changes in our

14

We ignore a small number of cases involving states that switched from a tax on income to a tax on revenue or vice
versa, the most prominent examples being Michigan, Ohio, and Texas.

7

sample coincide with the initiation of a state incentive program, or with a change in such a
program. The overlap with state taxes on bank profits is more substantial. In all cases, however,
we will show that our results are robust to excluding corporate tax changes that coincide with
such state-level policy changes.
State corporate income tax changes may trigger changes in government expenditure, which
could in turn affect economic conditions in treated counties. In practice, this is unlikely to
confound our findings because receipts from corporate taxes account for a very small share of
state government revenues. For example, corporate taxes accounted for only around 5% of state
government revenues in 2010. 15 A similar point is made by Suarez Serrato and Zidar (2016).
2.3 Tax Apportionment
Firms are not required to compute how much of their profit is earned in each of the states
they operate in. Instead, states proxy for the profit a firm earns in a state by multiplying the
firm’s total taxable income (from all states) by an apportionment formula. 16 Apportionment
formulae differ across states. As of 2010, ten states use a single-factor formula based on sales,
apportioning a firm’s profit to the state based on the ratio of the firm’s in-state sales to its total
sales. All other states use a three-factor formula based on an average of the proportions of sales,
property, and employees attributable to the state; and of these, 22 states overweight the sales
factor, while the remainder of states use an equally-weighted formula.
Given our diff-in-diff setup, this kind of variation in apportionment formulae across states is
easily differenced away and so cannot confound our results. But there are two other ways in
which apportionment rules can potentially affect our results.
First, apportionment rules can induce heterogeneous treatment effects. To illustrate, note that
apportionment implies that a firm earning $5 million and operating only in, say, New Jersey will

15
16

See Figure 1 in http://www2.census.gov/govs/statetax/2010stcreport.pdf.
I.e., firms do not apportion their costs among states, which reduces incentives to engage in transfer pricing.

8

pay the same amount of tax there as a multi-state firm with $5 million in profit apportioned to
New Jersey. If the apportionment formula over- or under-apportions “true” New Jersey profits,
multi-state and single-state firms may respond differently to a New Jersey tax change. For
example, multi-state firms benefitting from under-apportionment would respond less strongly
than single-state firms. If counties in our sample differ systematically in their mix of single- and
multi-state firms, heterogeneous treatment effects could result. While data on a county’s mix of
single- and multi-state firms are unavailable, we use a close proxy, namely a county’s smallbusiness employment share, and find our results to be robust. 17 Similarly, one might expect
variation of this type across industries, but our results hold even within industry.
Second, it is possible that state tax rate changes coincide with changes in apportionment rules
in the state. This could either lessen or amplify the response to tax rate changes. In practice, as
shown in Table 1, Panel B, states virtually never change apportionment rules when they change
tax rates. 18
3. Sample and Data
3.1 Outcome Variables
We use data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis’ (BEA) Regional Economic Accounts
for the period 1969 to 2010, which report annual measures for various definitions of employment
and income for each of the 3,132 counties in the U.S. For all variable definitions and details of
their construction, see Appendix B.
Our baseline employment measure is the number of full-time and part-time jobs in a county
scaled by county population. 19 Employment is measured by the location of the place of work, not
by the worker’s place of residence, and so includes workers commuting in from other counties.

17

See Appendix Table 3, columns 5 and 6.
Data for changes in apportionment rules are taken from Bernthal et al. (2012), Appendix C, and start in 1978.
19
This measure reflects the extensive margin of employment: whether or not the average county resident has a job.
Data on the intensive margin – hours worked conditional on having a job – are not available at the county level.
18

9

Income is measured as a county’s aggregate annual earnings from wage employment (in the
form of wages or salaries and including non-wage disbursements), scaled by county population.
The BEA measures wage income before tax and excludes income received in the form of
dividends, interest, or rent, which helps rule out a mechanical relation between changes in
corporate taxes and income. Income is reported either by place of work or by place of residence
(the difference being due to commuters) and either with or without government transfers. Our
baseline income measure is earnings by place of work excluding government transfers. We
consider the impact of commuting and government transfers separately in the appendix.
The self-employed are not subject to corporate taxation (their income is typically taxed as
personal income) and so constitute a useful placebo group whose response to corporate tax
changes we analyze separately. Accordingly, our baseline employment and income measures
exclude the self-employed.
3.2 Summary Statistics and Pre-Trends in Local Economic Conditions
Table 2 provides summary statistics of our dependent variables for treated and control border
counties and for their hinterland counties (defined as counties located in a state’s interior that are
one-removed from the border). Each statistic is measured the year before a tax change.
Panel A shows that employment and income levels differ significantly between treated and
control border counties in the year before a tax change. E.g., employment in treated counties
averages 35% of county population, significantly below the mean of 36.2% in control counties.
Per capita income is also significantly lower, by $423, in treated border counties. 20
For identification purposes, what is more important than differences in levels is differences in
growth rates. Identification relies on the parallel-trends assumption, which in our setting means
that employment and income should on average grow at the same rates in treated and control

20

The per capita income may seem low, but recall that we are scaling wage income by total county population and
taking an equally weighted average across counties.

10

border counties in the absence of a corporate tax change. Panel B of Table 2 provides a first
preliminary test of the parallel-trends assumption by comparing growth rates in the year before a
tax change. As shown, for each variable of interest, the growth rates in treated and control border
counties prior to the tax change are virtually identical and never statistically different from each
other. Moreover, since we find significant differences in employment and income levels, but not
in growth rates, it is essential to remove time-invariant heterogeneity in these variables across
counties; this is accomplished by the “first difference” in our diff-in-diff approach.
4. Empirical Strategy
Our aim is to measure the causal effects of corporate income taxes on employment and
income. To recap, the identification challenges are twofold. First, tax changes likely reflect
unobserved changes in economic conditions. A naïve regression of ex post economic outcomes
on changes in tax policy thus likely results in biased estimates, since the same omitted variables
that trigger the tax change may also affect economic conditions. Second, even if a particular tax
change truly was random, we do not observe how the economy would have performed in the
absence of the tax change. Some of the outcome “response” may have happened anyway and so
may not be a result of the tax change.
The following example illustrates the problem. The 1986 Tax Reform Act cut the federal
corporate income tax rate from 46% to 34%. Around this time, real GDP rose by 4.2% in 1985,
3.5% in 1986, and 3.5% in 1987; the unemployment rate was 7% in 1985, 6.6% in 1986, and
5.7% in 1987. Whether any of these changes in output or employment were caused by the tax cut
is hard to say. First, they could have been driven by something else changing in 1986, such as
changes in inflation, productivity growth, world trade, etc. That is, we cannot rule out the
presence of omitted variables. Second, we do not know how the U.S. economy would have fared
absent the Tax Reform Act. That is, we have no benchmark against which to measure the
observed changes in economic performance: we lack a counterfactual.
11

Our empirical strategy seeks to overcome these challenges by using variation in state
corporate income tax rates that are staggered across U.S. states and time (which provides a set of
plausible counterfactuals) and by narrowing in on contiguous counties straddling a state border
(which helps us to hold unobserved variation in economic conditions constant). Our strategy is
thus essentially a standard difference-in-differences approach that exploits a spatial discontinuity
in tax policy for identification purposes.
The focus on border counties rather than adjacent states has two main advantages. First,
while state tax changes are likely to be endogenous with respect to the state in question, they are
plausibly exogenous from the perspective of an individual county. 21 Second, economic
conditions are likely to be more homogeneous in a sufficiently narrow geographic region either
side of the state border than between one state and another. The more similar are the economic
conditions, the easier it is to difference away the confounding effects of unobserved local
economic conditions.
The main remaining identification concern, given our empirical approach, is that tax changes
on one side of the border could trigger changes in the behavior of either firms or households on
the other side of the border such that the economic trend in the control counties changes. This
would violate the parallel-trends assumption. We investigate this possibility at length in Section
5.5. In short, we find little evidence of such cross-border spillovers in our setting.
4.1 Regression Specifications
Our empirical models examine the effects of changes in states’ corporate income tax rates on
employment and pre-tax wage income in border counties using a difference-in-differences
regression specification of the following general form:

21

This identifying assumption is standard in studies implementing a cross-border discontinuity research design. In
principle, large or otherwise economically important counties may have more influence over policy decisions than
others. As we will show, our results are robust to excluding such counties from the estimation.

∆ln(𝑌𝑌)𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛽𝛽∆𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛿𝛿∆𝑋𝑋𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛼𝛼𝑔𝑔,𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡

(1)

where c, s, and t index counties, states, and time, respectively; Δ is the first-difference operator;
ln(𝑌𝑌)𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 is the outcome variable of interest, usually the natural log of either total county

employment or total county wage income (both scaled by county population and measured as of
the end of the calendar year); ∆𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡−1 is the percentage-point change in state corporate tax

rates (effective from the beginning of the calendar year, which is denoted with a t−1 subscript 22);

𝑋𝑋𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 is a set of control variables; 𝛼𝛼𝑔𝑔,𝑡𝑡 are border-county-group-by-year fixed effects, with

subscript g referencing a group of contiguous border counties; and 𝜀𝜀𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 is the usual error term.

Standard errors are clustered at the state level. For further information on variable definitions,
see Appendix B.
To evaluate the timing of the responses of employment and wage income to corporate tax
changes, we also estimate the following dynamic specification,
∆ln(𝑌𝑌)𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 = ∑3𝑖𝑖=−2 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 ∆𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡+𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿∆𝑋𝑋𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛼𝛼𝑔𝑔,𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡

(2)

using a six-year window around the tax change. This specification tests the parallel-trends
assumption required for identification by comparing outcome variables in treated and control
counties over a three-year period before a tax change. By symmetry, we estimate the impact
responses to tax changes over the next three years to allow sufficient time for potential reversals
or delayed responses to occur.
We estimate both equations (1) and (2) in first-differenced form, which effectively removes
county- and state-specific fixed effects that would be present in the corresponding levels
equations (i.e., prior to first-differencing). The specification thus allows us to easily
accommodate repeated treatments (i.e., a county experiencing a sequence of tax increases or tax

In a small number of instances, tax changes come into effect midway through the calendar year, rather than at the
beginning. We code these the same way as the other tax changes.

cuts over its time in the panel), treatment reversals (i.e., a tax increase followed some time later
by a tax cut, or vice versa), and asymmetry in the response to tax cuts and tax increases.
The inclusion of the fixed effects, αg,t , in equations (1) and (2) is critical, as it ensures that
the effect of tax changes on treated counties is always measured relative to bordering control
counties that do not experience a tax change. In this sense, αg,t absorbs any confounding local
economic shocks that are otherwise unobservable and so aids a causal interpretation of our
results. For further details on the construction of border-county sample and our estimation
approach, see Appendix A.
Throughout, we control for the following county-level demographic characteristics: the
fractions of the county’s residents who are aged over 25 and have a college degree; live in a rural
area; are white; are aged under 21; are aged over 65; reside in owner-occupied residences; or live
in single-mother households.
5. The Effects of Corporate Incomes Tax Changes on Employment and Income
5.1 Dynamic effects
We begin by presenting graphic evidence of the dynamic responses of employment and wage
income to corporate tax changes, based on the estimation of equation (2). The results, presented
in Figure 3, show the year-on-year percentage changes in total county employment (left panel)
and total county wage income (right panel) in the years surrounding the corporate tax change, as
measured relative to the unaffected neighboring counties on the other side of the state border.
In the years before a tax change (years -2 through 0), there are no statistically significant
differences in employment and wage income growth for counties located in states whose tax
rates later change compared with their cross-border neighbors. This finding supports the paralleltrends assumption: economic conditions are indeed roughly similar across state lines before a
state changes its corporate tax rates. One year after a tax change becomes effective, however, a

14

response is clearly evident. Our estimates suggest that a one percentage point tax increase (cut)
leads to employment in the affected county falling (rising) by about 0.2 percent and total wage
income falling (rising) by about 0.3 percent (as measured relative to the neighboring county
across the border). In the following years, growth in employment and income returns to rates that
are statistically indistinguishable from those in neighboring counties across the state border.
These findings suggest that changes in corporate tax rates effectively cause a level-shift in
employment and total wage income one year later. Although this adjustment might seem fast, in
our setting it might not be wholly surprising given that the state corporate tax changes in our
sample are typically quite modest (averaging about one percentage point in magnitude, see Table
1). These modestly sized corporate tax changes would presumably also entail relatively modest
adjustments by affected firms. Indeed, one way to interpret our estimates is that for the typical
corporate tax increase (cut) of about one percentage point, about two jobs out of every thousand
are lost (created). Our results indicate that firms are able to effectuate these relatively modest
responses after one year of a tax change coming into effect.
5.2 Employment
Table 3 explores the effects of corporate taxes on employment further by reporting estimates
of equation (1). Column 1 corroborates the results of the previous section, showing that changes
in corporate income taxes have a negative and statistically significant effect on employment,
controlling both for observed changes in county demographics and for unobserved variation in
local economic conditions using border-county-group-by-year fixed effects (αg,t in equation
(1)). 23 Economically, the point estimate implies that a one percentage-point increase (cut) in the

23
Though not shown to conserve space, only one of the demographic controls is significant at the 5% level: the
change in the fraction of county residents under the age of 21 is negatively associated with changes in employment.
However, the inclusion of demographic controls affects neither the point estimates nor the significance of our
results, suggesting that state tax changes do not coincide with material changes in a border county’s demographic
characteristics that would have an independent bearing on the county’s economic outcomes.

15

corporate tax rate reduces (raises) wage employment in the treated county by 0.241% (p<0.001)
all else equal, measured relative to neighboring counties on the other side of the state border
whose corporate tax rates remain unchanged.
Column 2 considers an alternative measure of the change in the corporate tax rate that is
commonly used in the tax literature: the change in the natural log of one minus the tax rate. This
specification provides us with an estimate of the elasticity of employment with respect to the netof-tax rate. As shown, this leads to an estimate that is virtually identical in magnitude and
statistical significance as that presented in column 1 (0.221, p<0.001).
How important is it to remove variation in local economic conditions? Column 3 reports a
specification that omits the border-county-group-by-year fixed effects and instead includes year
fixed effects only. 24 This increases the magnitude of the estimated tax effect noticeably, by
almost 40%, to –0.336 (p<0.001). Ignoring the effect of unobserved local variation would thus
lead to an overestimate of the effect of corporate taxes on employment. This implies that the
unobserved local variation goes in the same direction as the effect induced by the tax change
(e.g., employment-reducing tax increases coincide with times when employment is already
falling), which underscores the importance of controlling for local economic conditions using
our border-county approach.
Columns 1-3 assume that the effect of corporate tax changes is symmetric. Column 4 relaxes
this assumption. This reveals that the negative employment effect is driven entirely by tax
increases: while tax cuts do not affect employment, either statistically (p=0.614) or economically
(with a point estimate of only 0.065), tax increases are associated with fewer jobs. The effect is
significant, both statistically (p<0.001) and economically: increasing the state’s corporate tax
rate by one percentage point reduces employment by 0.282% in a treated county.

24

The sample size in this column is smaller than in column 1 as we remove duplicated control counties that are
paired to more than one treated county (see Appendix A). This has no bearing on the estimates shown in column 3.

16

We next present a simple placebo test. Self-employment income tends to be taxed as personal
income rather than corporate income. The self-employed should thus not be directly affected by
corporate tax changes, though they could be affected indirectly by changes in aggregate county
demand. Column 5 shows that corporate tax changes have no statistically significant effect on
the number of self-employed. The tax-increase coefficient for the self-employed is -0.137
(p=0.223), and the tax cut coefficient is similarly statistically insignificant.
The placebo test indirectly validates our results: if corporate tax increases had systematically
coincided with negative economic shocks specific to treated border counties, we should have
found an effect among the self-employed. It also suggests that a primary channel through which
corporate tax affects economic activity, at least in our setting, is through companies’ demand for
labor. Secondary effects, due to reductions in wage employment reducing aggregate demand to
the potential detriment of all county residents, including the self-employed, appear to be too
modest to measure reliably.
Column 6 refines our identification strategy by controlling for local industry-level shocks.
The BEA reports county-level employment and income broken down by industry. For
employment, the finest industry breakdown is at the SIC1/NAICS2 level. 25 These data allow us
to compare employment in bordering counties within the same industry, by including bordercounty-group-by-industry-year fixed effects. Doing so controls for time-varying localized shocks
to a particular industry within a group of bordering counties. If such shocks were to
systematically coincide with corporate tax changes, they could be driving our results.
This appears not to be the case, however. The estimate in column 6 shows that a one
percentage point increase in the corporate tax rate reduces employment by 0.184% (p=0.024),

25

The BEA’s county/industry-level data transition from the SIC to NAICS industry classification systems in 2001.
Because the industry breakdowns are too course to match SIC codes to NAICS codes using concordance tables, we
drop observations for 2001 in our county-industry level analysis.

17

measured relative to employment in the same industry in bordering counties whose tax rates
remain unchanged. Tax cuts continue to have no significant effect on employment.
In Appendix Table 1, columns 1 to 3, we present additional robustness checks based on
alternative employment measures. Specifically, we consider the change in employment without
scaling by county population; employment scaled by the working age population (those aged 2070); and private-sector employment only, excluding government employees. None of these
alternative measures has any effect on our results.
5.3 Income
Table 4 presents estimates of the effect of corporate taxes on income. Column 1 shows that
changes in corporate income taxes affect per capita wage income negatively, controlling both for
observed changes in county demographics and for unobserved variation in local economic
conditions. 26 Economically, the point estimate implies that a one percentage point increase (cut)
in the corporate tax rate reduces (raises) wage income in the treated county by 0.367%
(p<0.001), relative to counties on the other side of the state border whose corporate taxes are
unchanged. As in the case of employment, estimates of the elasticity of wage income with
respect to the net-of-tax rate, shown is column 2, are virtually identical in magnitude and
statistical significance as those presented in column 1 (0.338, p<0.001).
Column 3 replaces the border-county-group-by-year fixed effects with year fixed effects.
Doing so significantly increases the magnitude of the estimated tax effect to -0.523% (p<0.001),
which is about 40% greater (in absolute terms) than the baseline. Thus, as in the case of
employment, ignoring the effect of unobserved local variation would result in an overestimate of
the effect of corporate tax changes on per capita wage income. As before, this implies that the
unobserved local variation goes in the same direction as the effect induced by the tax change

26

None of the demographic controls is significant at the 5% level.

18

(e.g., employment-reducing tax increases coincide with times when per capita wage income is
already falling), again highlighting the importance of controlling for local economic conditions
using the border-county approach.
Column 4 shows that the effect is asymmetric: it is driven entirely by tax increases, just as it
was for employment. Economically, a one percentage point increase in the corporate tax rate
reduces per capita wage income by 0.42% (p<0.001). Together with the negative effect of tax
increases on employment in Table 3, this negative income response suggests that a primary
channel through which tax increases harm economic activity is job losses (the extensive margin
of employment). Job losses in turn reduce income levels.
In contrast, the effect of tax cuts on income is small (with a point estimate of 0.132 in column
4) and not statistically significant (p=0.455). The absence of an income effect indirectly rules out
that tax cuts boost hours worked conditional on having a job (something that lack of data
prevents us from estimating directly). If they did, we should find an increase in income following
tax cuts. We thus conclude that in our setting, tax cuts appear to affect neither the extensive
margin of employment (the number of jobs) nor the intensive margin (hours worked).
Column 5 uses the self-employed as a placebo. Consistent with our earlier finding that the
number of self-employed is unaffected by corporate tax changes, we find that neither increases
nor cuts in corporate taxes have a significant effect on the pre-tax income of the self-employed
(who are not usually subject to corporate income tax). This reinforces the interpretation that a
primary way corporate tax changes affect economic activity is through their effect on companies’
demand for labor. Secondary effects, resulting from changes in aggregate demand in the county,
appear too modest to affect the self-employed.
Columns 5 and 6 control for local industry-level shocks, just as we did in the case of
employment. For income, the industry breakdown is available at both the SIC1/NAICS2 level
and the SIC2/NAICS3 level. The results show that whether we control for industry-level shocks
19

at the SIC1/NAICS2 level (column 5) or at the finer SIC2/NAICS3 level (column 6), we find
that tax increases reduce income by approximately 0.3% (p=0.003 and p=0.019, respectively),
while tax cuts have no effect.
In Appendix Table 1, columns 4 to 6, we present additional robustness checks based on
alternative measures of wage income. Specifically, we consider private-sector wage income only,
excluding income earned by government employees; wage income plus government transfers
(such as unemployment insurance and welfare benefits), which may act as automatic stabilizers;
and wage income by place of residence rather than by place of work, to account for the effect of
commuters. None of these alternative measures changes our conclusions.
5.4 Impact Response Functions
We cap off this set of results by presenting impact response functions, analogous to those
commonly shown in macroeconomics papers. Figure 4 plots the cumulative estimated response
to a one percentage point tax increase or tax cut for the three years after it becomes effective,
along with 95% confidence bands. 27 As the figure shows, tax increases effectively cause a levelshift in economic activity (just as implied by Figure 3), with both employment and income
falling significantly one year after the tax increase becomes effective (t = 1), followed by no
subsequent reversion over the next two years. 28 It thus appears that firms are able to react
relatively quickly to the modestly sized tax increases observed in our setting. (For a discussion of
the speed of the adjustment, see Section 5.1.) In contrast, we don’t find that corporate tax cuts
have significant effects on employment or income at any point.

27
Consistent with the validity of the parallel-trends assumption shown earlier, none of the estimated pre-tax-change
effects is statistically significant.
28
Specifically, in response to a one percentage point tax increase employment falls by 0.239% one year after the tax
increase becomes effective (p=0.002) and by an insignificant 0.074% and 0.088% incrementally over the next two
years. Income falls by 0.366% one year after the tax increase becomes effective (p<0.001) and then rises by an
insignificant 0.001% and 0.022% incrementally over the next two years.

20

5.5 Cross-Border Spillovers
If the economies of border counties are highly integrated with each other across state lines,
our results could be confounded by cross-border spillovers between treated and control counties.
Such spillovers, if they are present, could result from changes in the behavior of either firms or
households.
5.5.1 Potential Spillover Effects of Corporate Tax Increases
Consider the case of a corporate tax increase. Our findings suggest that firms in treated
counties respond to a corporate tax increase by reducing their demand for labor, which in turn
lowers county income. However, there are potentially two ways in which a control county might
be indirectly affected due to spillovers emanating from the treated county.
First, since households in the treated county have lower incomes, they may spend less, not
just in their home county but in the wider local economy – including the control counties. This
“household spending” channel would attenuate the estimated effects of corporate tax increases:
reduced spending by treated households would spill over to control counties, thus potentially
lowering employment and income there as well. (The diff-in-diff estimate would thus be smaller
than it would be without the spillover.)
Whether this channel is in operation can be tested. If reduced household spending is leading
to negative spillovers across the state border, then this effect would be stronger in control
counties closer to the border compared to other counties in the control state that are located
further from the border. We will therefore test whether there are differences in employment and
income growth in control-border counties relative to hinterland counties in the interior of the
control state (again defined as those counties one-removed from the border). 29
29
We borrow the term “hinterland” county from Huang (2008). Also, recall that income and employment are
measured by place of work, which allows for the possibility that firms in the treated county hire not only fewer
workers who live in the treated county but also fewer workers who commute in from a control county. Spillovers
due to cross-border commuting can thus not confound our estimates. Our results are also robust to measuring
income by place of residence, see Appendix Table 1, column 6.

21

A second type of cross-border spillover may be due to firms reacting to a corporate tax
increase by shifting operations from the treated county to the control county in order to mitigate
the effects of the tax increase. Such “corporate spillovers” would amplify the estimated treatment
effect: economic activity would fall in treated counties while rising in control counties. If so, this
would lead us to overstate the effect of corporate tax increases on economic activity.
If distance matters in firms’ decisions as to where to relocate operations following a
corporate tax increase, the control state’s border counties should benefit more from corporate
spillovers than the control state’s hinterland counties. Thus, a comparison of border and
hinterland counties in the control state can shed light on both household and corporate spillovers
(with the two types of spillover implying opposite effects). 30 In the case of corporate spillovers,
an additional test may be useful. Corporate relocations across the border are arguably more likely
if, after the tax increase, the treated state has a higher tax rate than the neighboring control state.
Empirically, it would be surprising if firms reacted to a corporate tax increase in one state by
relocating to an even higher taxing state.
5.5.2 Potential Spillover Effects of Corporate Tax Cuts
A possible reason for our finding that corporate tax cuts have little effect on average is that
their effects may dissipate across state borders. This would be the case if households increased
their spending both at home and in neighboring control counties, which would raise employment
and incomes in control counties and thereby attenuate the estimated treatment effects.
Theoretically, it is also possible that firms located in control counties react to a tax cut in the
treated county by shifting operations across the state line. But as this would amplify the
estimated treatment effects, it is unlikely to explain the lack of sensitivity of employment and

30

To be clear, firms might react to a corporate tax increase by shifting operations to potentially anywhere in the
country (see Giroud and Rauh (2017)). Our concern, however, is to test only for whether border counties in control
states are disproportionately affected by this type of relocation – and this is what our tests rule out.

22

income to corporate tax cuts.
5.5.3 Testing for Spillover Effects
In Table 5, Panel A, we test for both “household” and “corporate” spillovers by comparing
outcomes in border versus hinterland counties, both in the same control states, around the time of
tax increases and tax cuts in neighboring treated states. Specifically, we regress the change in
employment or income growth on an indicator for whether a county is a hinterland county.
Critically, we always compare border counties in control states to their neighboring (i.e.,
adjacent) hinterland counties by including border/hinterland-group-by-year fixed effects. These
effectively control for all shocks to local economic conditions common to border and hinterland
counties and thus allow us to isolate the differential effect of being a hinterland county. 31 The
household spending channel implies that hinterland counties do better than border counties when
taxes rise in the neighboring state and fare worse when taxes are cut. The corporate spillover
channel implies the opposite.
The results show that there are no significant differences in either employment growth
(columns 1 and 2) or income growth (columns 3 and 4) between hinterland and border counties
in control states around the time of tax increases or tax cuts in neighboring treated states. We
believe that these findings provide strong evidence that our estimates are not systematically
biased due to either household or corporate spillovers.
Table 5, Panel B, returns to our baseline sample and allows the effect of tax changes to
depend on whether the control county has a higher or lower tax rate than the treated county once
the tax change has come into effect. As discussed, it seems plausible that if firms respond to
corporate tax increases by relocating activity across the border, all else equal, relocation is more

31

Our conclusions don’t change if we compare all border counties in a control state to all hinterland counties, or to
all counties in the interior of the control state (thus including state-by-year fixed effects in the regressions instead of
border/hinterland-group-by-year fixed effects). In all these tests some smaller states (e.g., Delaware and Rhode
Island) and DC have no interior and so are omitted.

23

likely to take place if the neighboring control state has a lower tax rate. This would imply greater
amplification of the effect of tax increases when the control state’s tax rate is lower.
The data reject this: employment and income decline significantly in response to corporate
tax increases whether the tax rate is higher or lower in the control state. Importantly, the
coefficients are not significantly different from each other. Thus, firms operating in a treated
county do not appear to respond to a tax rise by shifting operations to a neighboring county with
a lower tax rate. Similarly, since the estimated coefficients for tax cuts in all cases remain
insignificant, there is no evidence that firms operating in a control county shift operations to a
neighboring treated state that has cut its corporate tax rate below that of their home state.
Overall, it therefore seems unlikely that our estimated treatment effects are inflated due to firms
in treated counties moving operations directly across the state border in response to tax changes.
In sum, the evidence suggests that cross-border spillovers from treated to control counties,
due to either firms or households, are unlikely to be a serious concern in our setting. In other
words, it appears that control border counties on average remain on their pre-treatment trend
even after a tax change in a neighboring state. They hence provide a plausible set of
counterfactuals against which to measure the economic effects of corporate tax changes in
adjacent treated counties.
5.6 Robustness and Alternative Channels
We next present several important robustness checks. Geography, in particular, gives rise to a
number of potential concerns with our empirical strategy. The first is that some counties may be
large relative to the state as a whole and so may disproportionately influence state policy. A
related concern is that even though treated and control border counties are neighbors, their
geographic centers may in some instances be quite far apart. This would undermine the
identifying assumption that they share similar local economic conditions prior to a tax change. A
third concern is more specific: one could be concerned that the decline in manufacturing in the
24

rust belt might be driving our results. 32 A fourth concern is that our results, being equalweighted, might be driven by the experience of small (and so potentially unrepresentative)
counties.
Table 6 shows that our results are robust to these geographic concerns. Columns 1 and 2
remove potentially politically influential counties by restricting the sample to border counties
that account for no more than 10% of a state’s population, as measured in the year before a tax
change. Columns 3 and 4 restrict the sample to border-county pairs whose geographic mid-points
are no more than 20 miles apart. 33 Columns 5 and 6 exclude counties in the industrial Midwest
(OH, PA, IN, MI, IL, and WV) in the 1970s and 1980s. Columns 7 and 8 present weighted least
squares regressions (weighting by employment measured prior to the relevant tax change). 34 In
each case, the point estimates are nearly identical to our baseline estimates. 35
Table 7 presents further robustness checks related to various aspects of state tax policy. A
natural interpretation of the results in Tables 3 and 4 is that firms reduce their labor demand as
some activities cease to be economically viable at the higher tax rate. But there is also another
possibility: firms might be responding to a contemporaneous reduction in credit. This may occur
because banks too pay state corporate taxes, albeit often on a special schedule that only applies
to banks. An increase in state taxes on banks could thus reduce the supply of credit available in
the state, 36 and firms might then be responding to a credit supply shock rather than a corporate
tax increase occurring at the same time.
32

Some large tax increases are concentrated in the industrial Midwest in the 1970s and 1980s, an area which
suffered declines in industrial activity, increasing budget deficits, and tax increases to balance these budgets.
33
We obtain latitudes and longitudes of county midpoints from the Census Bureau’s Gazetteer files and use the
great-circle distance formula to calculate the shortest distance between the two midpoints. The results are similarly
robust to dropping counties covering large geographic areas, common in the western part of the U.S.
34
Although the tax increase coefficients are somewhat smaller in the weighted least squares regressions, using the
test developed in DuMouchel and Duncan (1983), we cannot reject the null hypothesis that their size is the same as
in the our baseline OLS estimates.
35
Excluding other potentially influential observations similarly leaves our results unaffected. For example,
restricting the sample to tax increases and tax cuts of commensurate size and dropping tax increases and tax cuts
larger than two, or larger than five, percentage points leads to qualitatively similar conclusions.
36
For evidence on this channel, see Smolyansky (2018).

25

Fortunately, as Table 1 shows, our sample period contains plenty of corporate income tax
changes that do not coincide with changes in state bank taxes. Using this subsample, columns 1
and 2 of Table 7 confirm that corporate tax increases lead to significant drops in employment and
income even when they are not accompanied by increases in bank tax rates, with economic
magnitudes and statistical significance comparable to the overall sample.
In columns 3 and 4, we remove a small number of corporate tax changes that coincide with
the initiation of, or a change in, a state incentive program rewarding companies for undertaking
either more investment or R&D or for hiring more labor. 37 This has no effect on our results – the
point estimates are virtually identical to those in Tables 3 and 4, suggesting that our findings are
not driven by coincident changes in state tax incentive programs.
So far, our analysis has focused on changes in state corporate tax rates. However, the tax
burden faced by firms will also be affected by the state tax base (see Suarez Serrato and Zidar
(2018)). To investigate if variation in the state tax base affects our results, columns 5 and 6
include additional state tax base control variables in our baseline regressions, following the
approach in Suarez Serrato and Zidar (2016). 38 This leaves our results unchanged.
Columns 7 and 8 address the concern that treated and control counties may start off with very
different tax rates. For example, in 1981 New Mexico increased its corporate tax rate from 5% to
6%. At that time, Texas, which borders New Mexico, had no corporate income tax. It is an open
question whether Texas counties on the New Mexico border are good controls in this instance.
We address this concern by restricting the sample to border-county pairs whose tax rates differ
by at most 20 basis points two years prior to treatment. This restriction reduces the sample size
by over 90%, yet our broad conclusions are unchanged. If anything, our results become stronger:
37
For details on these state tax credits, see Chirinko and Wilson (2008), Wilson (2009), and Chirinko and Wilson
(2017).
38
In particular, we include the same tax base controls as listed in the Online Appendix of Suarez Serrato and Zidar
(2016), Section E.4.1. These include controls for throwback rules, combined reporting, tax credits, loss carryforward and carry-back rules, federal income tax deductibility and accelerated depreciation, among others.

26

in this subsample, the estimated effect of a corporate tax increase on employment is –0.516%
(p=0.021) and on income –0.605% (p=0.008), while tax cuts continue to have no statistically
significant effects.
5.7 Business Cycle Effects
Our results so far show that corporate tax increases result in harm to the local economy by
reducing employment and income while corporate tax cuts have no significant effect. We next
consider how these results vary over the business cycle. Table 8 estimates the effects of increases
and cuts in corporate tax rates separately in recessions and expansions, which are measured at the
national level as dated by the NBER (columns 1 and 2), at the regional level using the BEA’s
eight economic regions (columns 3 and 4), and at the state level (columns 5 and 6). Regional and
state recessions are coded based on whether real personal income (in the region or the state,
respectively) has fallen for at least two quarters in the year prior to the tax change becoming
effective.
Table 8 reveals a striking pattern: while we saw previously that corporate tax cuts were
ineffective on average, when implemented during a recession, tax cuts significantly boost both
employment and wage income. Employment increases by around 0.6% for every percentage
point cut in corporate tax rates implemented during a national, regional, or state recession, while
wage income increases by around 1%. During expansions, on the other hand, we continue to find
that tax cuts have no significant effects.
The effects of corporate tax increases, by contrast, do not vary over the business cycle.
Whether they occur during recessions or expansions, corporate tax increases consistently reduce
employment and wage income, and they do so by a similar amount.
5.8 Heterogeneous Effects
To shed light on the channel and provide further robustness, we next test for heterogeneous
effects. As noted earlier, self-employment income tends to be taxed as personal income rather
27

than corporate income, and indeed our prior results validated that neither the employment nor the
income of the self-employed is affected by corporate tax changes (see column 5 of Tables 3 and
4). A corollary of this finding is that counties where self-employment makes up a larger share of
economic activity should be less affected by corporate tax changes. In columns 1 and 2 of Table
9, we test this hypothesis by interacting the tax increase and tax cut variables with indicators for
whether the county’s share of income earned by proprietors, relative to total county income, is
above or below the median among all counties (as measured in the year prior to the relevant tax
change). The results confirm our hypothesis. Indeed, tax increases only have significantly
negative effects in counties in which proprietors earn a low share of total county income, and the
estimated effects in these counties are more negative than in our baseline specification. These
findings give us further confidence that the effects we are picking up are due specifically to
corporate tax changes directly affecting economic activity, as opposed to other confounding
factors.
In columns 3 and 4 of Table 9, we test for whether corporate tax changes have differential
effects based on the pre-existing level of a state’s corporate taxes. We believe this test is
interesting because it is an open question whether a tax increase of one percentage point would
have the same effect in a state whose prior corporate tax rate was, say, 2%, compared to a state
where it was 10%. Our framework allows us to easily test for this type of nonlinearity. To do so,
we interact the tax increase and tax cut variables with indicators for whether the county’s state
corporate tax rate was above or below the national median among all counties (as measured in
the year prior to the relevant tax change).
The results show that corporate tax increases only have significantly negative effects in states
that start off with low corporate tax rates. Moreover, in these states, the effects are more negative
than in our baseline specification (and also more negative than in states with high corporate tax
rates). These results make sense for the following reason: prior to a given tax change taking
28

place, firms will endogenously choose where to locate; and overall, one would expect that
economic activity that is more tax sensitive to endogenously locate in states with lower corporate
tax rates. Thus, when these low-taxing states do increase their corporate tax rates, the negative
effects are especially pronounced. This finding arguably has the interesting policy implication
that low taxing states may find it particularly costly to raise taxes, because the type of economic
activity that has selected into the low-tax environment is more tax sensitive. To our knowledge,
we are the first to document this type of nonlinearity.
We have also investigated several other potential heterogeneous effects, based on the
flexibility of the state’s labor markets, and on several county characteristics. If tax increases
harm employment and income by reducing firms’ demand for labor, the effects might differ
based on the strength of unionization in a state. In Appendix Table 2, we investigate this
possibility by testing for heterogeneous effects based on whether the state has a right-to-work
law in place and whether the workforce is heavily unionized (i.e., whether their private-sector
unionization rate is above or below the national median). 39 In either case, however, we do not
find evidence of heterogeneous effects. Similarly, in Appendix Table 3, we investigate
heterogeneous effects based on county income per capita (i.e., whether the county is “rich” or
“poor”), county population density, and the share of county employment attributable to small
establishments. In each case, we fail to find evidence of heterogeneous effects. We conclude
from these tests that our estimates are remarkably stable, and that our results are not driven by
either the degree of state unionization or by key differences in county characteristics.
6. Conclusions
Against the background of continuing controversy over the benefits of corporate tax reform,
we ask how corporate taxes affect employment and wage income. Answering this question is

39

Right-to-work laws weaken unions by prohibiting closed shops, payments of union dues as a condition of
employment, or other ways to discriminate against non-union workers (Ellwood and Fine (1987), Holmes (1998)).

29

empirically challenging. We propose an identification strategy that combines staggered changes
in corporate income tax rates across U.S. states with a focus on contiguous counties straddling
state borders. The resulting spatial-discontinuity design permits a causal interpretation of our
results by establishing a counterfactual against which to measure the effects of corporate tax
changes and by reducing omitted-variable biases resulting from the confounding influence of
unobserved variation in local economic conditions. Effectively, our empirical approach exploits
the fact that state tax policy ends at the state border, while economic conditions do not.
Our estimates suggest that a one percentage point corporate tax increase (cut) leads to
employment in the affected county falling (rising) by about 0.2 percent and total wage income
falling (rising) by about 0.3 percent (as measured relative to the neighboring county across the
border). We find evidence of asymmetric effects: tax increases are uniformly harmful, while tax
cuts only appear to be effectual in boosting economic activity if implemented during recessions.
The strength of our research design is that it allows us to run a “clean experiment.” However,
we caution against naïvely extrapolating our estimates to assess the possible impact of a federal
corporate tax change. Tax changes at the federal level will give rise to general equilibrium
effects that we cannot account for in our local comparison of bordering counties. Moreover,
federal corporate tax changes—particularly cuts—have in recent history been of a magnitude that
lies well outside those that we observe in our sample. Nonetheless, we believe that our results
remain qualitatively useful in the context of the broader debate about corporate tax reform. In
essence, our key finding is that companies appear to be highly responsive to changes in corporate
taxes. Our methodology allows us to more confidently attribute these responses specifically to
changes in corporate tax rates rather than other confounding factors. Since we are able to identify
these strong responses quite cleanly, our analysis suggests that companies are indeed highly
sensitive to corporate tax incentives.

Appendix A. Treatments and Controls.
We estimate equations (1) in a sample that includes only years in which one of the counties
in a contiguous border-county group experiences a tax change. And analogously, we estimate
equation (2) in a sample that includes only the six year window around one of the counties in a
contiguous border-county group experiencing a tax change. Other years without a tax change in a
contiguous border-county group are excluded from the estimation sample as they do not
contribute to the identification of the effect of tax changes, and so are superfluous. This approach
allows for the possibility that a treated county can itself become a control county if sufficient
time has elapsed since it last experienced a tax change. 40
There are 3,132 counties in the U.S. 41 Of these, 943 are “treated” in the sense that they lie on
the border of a state that changes corporate taxes between 1970 and 2010. Since a state can
change corporate taxes multiple times, we have a total of 3,390 treated county-years. These are
matched to 3,650 control county-years covering 978 distinct counties located on the border of an
adjoining state. (We have more controls than treated because the average treated county borders
more than one control county.)
Several issues require care when constructing the treatment and control groups. First, a
county experiencing a tax shock is potentially a candidate to serve as a control later, when the
neighboring county, which initially served as control, itself experiences a tax change. For
example, in 1972 Virginia raised its corporate tax rate by one percentage point. In 1991, North
Carolina, which borders Virginia, raised its rate by 1.06 percentage points. Although the Virginia
counties on the North Carolina border were treated in 1972, arguably a sufficient amount of time

40

Throughout that analysis, we impose the conditions that to be eligible to serve as a control, a county must not
itself have been subject to a corporate income tax change for at least four years. This ensures that a county has
“recovered” from the effects of a tax change (if any) and so has regained its trend growth rates in employment and
income. Our results are not sensitive to the choice of cutoff.
41
This includes county-equivalents (such as Louisiana’s parishes) except in Virginia, whose independent cities the
Bureau of Economic Analysis combines with the nearest county.

34

has elapsed by 1991 to permit them to serve as controls. On the other hand, if hypothetically
North Carolina had raised its rate in 1973, it would be doubtful whether the Virginian counties
on its border are good controls, given that they have themselves only recently been subject to a
tax shock. Thus, we adopt a conservative approach, requiring control counties not to have been
subject to a tax change themselves for at least four years. 42
Second, a treated border county can neighbor multiple contiguous counties in the adjacent
state. In the figure below, this is the case for county B in state X, which borders both counties C
and D in state Y. We allow both counties C and D to serve as controls for county B when state X
changes its tax rate. 43 That is, B, C, and D form a “group” of contiguous border counties, with B
being treated and C and D serving as controls.
State X
A

B

State Y

C

D

The third complication is best explained with reference to county C in the above figure.
County C is adjacent to both counties A and B. So if state X changes its taxes, county C would
be in two separate contiguous-county groups: the control group for county A and the control
group for county B. In terms of the regression specification, this means that observations for
county C are duplicated in instances where state Y serves as a control for state X, such that
counties A and C form one group of contiguous-border counties and counties B, C, and D form

42

There are 18 state-years in our sample that experience a tax change but have no valid control group based on our
criteria. These are hence excluded from the analysis.
43
This approach is standard in studies implementing a border discontinuity research design. See for example Dube,
Lester, and Reich (2010).

35

another. County C appears twice since it belongs to both groups.
The final issue arises if state Y is treated at some later time. In this case, the treated and
control groups look quite different. For example, A, B, and C now form a contiguous bordercounty group, whereas before, when state X was treated, A was only in a group with C.

36

Appendix B. Variable Definitions.
County-level dependent variables
All dependent variables are from the Personal Income and Employment Summary of the Bureau of Economic
Analysis’s (BEA) Regional Economic Accounts, unless stated otherwise.
Employment is the total number of wage and salary jobs (both full time and part time; line code 7020), scaled by
either total county population (line code 20) or the number of county residents aged between 20 and 70.
Employment in a county is measured by the location of the place of work, not by the worker’s place of residence.
Employment (excluding government) is the total number of wage and salary jobs (line code 7020) minus
employment by government and government enterprises (line code 900 in the BEA’s county-industry employment
data files), scaled by total county population (line code 20).
Self-employment is the number of nonfarm self-employed workers in a county (line code 60 in the BEA’s countyindustry employment data files), scaled by total county population (line code 20).
Wage income by place of work is measured as the earnings by place of work (line code 35) minus proprietors’
income (line code 70), scaled by total county population (line code 20).
Wage income by place of work (excluding government) is measured as the earnings by place of work (line code 35
in the BEA’s) minus proprietors’ income (line code 70) minus earnings of government employees (line code 900 in
the BEA’s county-industry income data files), scaled by total county population (line code 20).
Wage income by place of work (including transfers) is measured as the earnings by place of work (line code 35)
minus proprietors’ income (line code 70) plus personal current transfer receipts (line code 47), scaled by total county
population (line code 20). Transfers receipts include food stamps, unemployment insurance, and training assistance.
Wage income by place of residence is measured as the earnings by place of work (line code 35) minus proprietors’
income (line code 70) plus adjustment for residence (line code 42), scaled by total county population (line code 20).
Self-employment income by place of work is measured as the nonfarm proprietors’ income (line code 72), scaled by
total county population (line code 20).
County level demographic control variables
County demographic information from the decennial U.S. Census for the years 1970-2010, is obtained from the
National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS.org). The first differences of the following
demographic controls are included in regressions: percentage of persons over 25 with a 4-year college degree or
higher qualification; percentage of the population that resides in a rural area; percentage of the population that is
white; percentage of the population that is 21 or under; percentage of the population that is 65 or older; percentage
of the population residing in owner-occupied residences; and percentage of families with children that are singlemother households. For off-census years we linearly interpolate the relevant numerator and denominator and then
divide the two to obtain each of these percentage measures, giving us an average growth rate of each variable over
the course of a decade.

This figure plots the impact responses of employment and wage income to changes in state corporate tax rates, along with 95% confidence bands. The figure shows
the cumulative effect of a one percentage point tax increase or tax cut on employment and wage income, starting one year after the tax change becomes effective
(t = 1). The y-axis measures the cumulative percent change in our baseline employment and wage income measures.

Panel A reports summary statistics for the 250 changes in state corporate income tax rates that occurred over the period from 1970 to 2010. The data sources are
detailed in the text. Throughout the analysis, we focus on changes in the top statutory marginal tax rate. Panel B reports the extent to which increases or cuts in
state corporate income taxes coincide with other state-level policy changes. We focus on initiations of, and changes in, state incentive programs (i.e., tax credits
for investment, R&D, or job creation), changes in state taxes on banks, and changes in apportionment rules.

Table 3. Effect of Corporate Tax Changes on Employment.
We estimate the effect of corporate income taxes on employment in a differences-in-differences specification that regresses log changes in county employment on
changes in the state’s top marginal corporate income tax rate. Our baseline employment measure in columns 1 to 4 is the total number of wage and salary jobs
(full-time and part-time) in a county scaled by total county population. Column 5 estimates the effect on the number of nonfarm self-employed workers. Treated
counties are those that are located along the border of a state that changes its corporate income tax rate. Control counties are those that lie on the other side of the
border in a neighboring state that has not changed its corporate income tax rate. Except in columns 3 and 6, each regression includes a set of group-by-year fixed
effects common to groups of continuous (i.e., adjacent) counties on both sides of the border, thus removing the influence of time-varying shocks to local economic
conditions. In column 6, the unit of analysis is a county-industry-year, with the industry breakdown at the SIC1/NAICS2 level. Column 6 includes a set of
group*industry-year fixed effects to control for time-varying shocks that affect the same industry in groups of contiguous border counties. All specifications include
changes in county-level demographic controls as detailed in the text (to conserve space, their coefficients are not reported). For variable definitions and details of
their construction, see Appendix B. Standard errors clustered at the state level are shown in italics underneath the coefficient estimates. ***, **, and * denote
significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level (two-sided), respectively.

Table 4. Effect of Corporate Tax Changes on Income.
We estimate the effect of corporate income taxes on wage and self-employment income in a differences-in-differences specification that regresses log changes in
county income on changes in the state’s top marginal corporate income tax rate. Our baseline income measure in columns 1 to 4 is total wage and salary income
(by place of work) in a county scaled by total county population. Column 5 estimates the effect on income from nonfarm self-employment. All income variables
are pre-tax. Treated counties are those that are located along the border of a state that changes its corporate income tax rate. Control counties are those that lie on
the other side of the border in a neighboring state that has not changed its corporate income tax rate. Except in columns 3, 6 and 7, each regression includes a set
of group-by-year fixed effects common to groups of continuous (i.e., adjacent) counties on both sides of the border, thus removing the influence of time-varying
shocks to local economic conditions. In column 6 and 7, the unit of analysis is a county-industry-year, with the industry breakdown at the SIC1/NAICS2 level in
column 6, and the SIC2/NAICS3 level in column 7. Column 6 and 7 include a set of group*industry-year fixed effects to control for time-varying shocks that affect
the same industry in groups of contiguous border counties. All specifications include changes in county-level demographic controls as detailed in the text (to
conserve space, their coefficients are not reported). For variable definitions and details of their construction, see Appendix B. Standard errors clustered at the state
level are shown in italics underneath the coefficient estimates. ***, **, and * denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level (two-sided), respectively.

Table 5. Testing for Cross-Border Spillovers.
This table tests for cross-border spillovers emanating from changes in either household or firm behavior. For example, following a corporate tax increase, firms
may move operations from the treated county to the control county, creating jobs there. Such a substitution of workers from treated to control counties would
amplify the estimated treatment effect. Alternatively, in response to a corporate tax increase, laid off workers in the treated county might spend less across the
border – the potential reduction in demand in the control county might lead to layoffs there, which would attenuate our estimated treatment effects. Panel A tests
for spillovers by examining the effects in control states, and comparing control border counties to hinterland counties (i.e., counties located in a control state’s
interior that are one-removed from the border). For example, household spillovers in response to tax rises (tax cuts) imply systematic reductions (increases) in
economic activity in control border counties relative to hinterland counties, which being further away from the border should be less affected by the spillover. Panel
B returns to the baseline estimation sample of Tables 3 and 4 to further test for corporate spillovers. Columns 1 and 2 allow the effect of tax changes to depend on
whether the control county has a higher or lower corporate tax rate than the treated county once the tax change has come into effect. Arguably, if corporate spillovers
exist, firms are more likely to shift operations in response to a tax increase if the neighboring control county has a lower corporate tax rate (and vice versa for a tax
cut). For variable definitions and details of their construction, see Appendix B. Standard errors clustered at the state level are shown in italics underneath the
coefficient estimates. ***, **, and * denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level (two-sided), respectively.

Table 6. Politically Influential Counties, Distant County Pairs, the Rust Belt, and County Size.
To investigate robustness, columns 1 and 2 remove potentially politically influential counties by restricting the estimation sample to counties that account for no
more than 10% of a state’s population, as measured in the year prior to a tax change. Columns 3 and 4 remove far-apart county pairs by restricting the estimation
sample to border county pairs whose geographic midpoints are no more than 20 miles apart. Columns 5 and 6 remove “rust belt” counties in the industrial Midwest
(in OH, PA, IN, MI, IL, and WV) which in the 1970s and 1980s suffered declines in industrial activity. Columns 7 and 8 report estimates weighted by county
employment measured the year before a tax change. Each specification includes a set of group-by-year fixed effects (as in Tables 3 and 4) to remove the influence
of time-varying shocks to local economic conditions. For variable definitions and details of their construction, see Appendix B. Standard errors clustered at the

Table 7. Robustness: Coincident Policy Changes, the Tax Base, and Tax Differentials.
To further investigate robustness, columns 1 and 2 drop corporate tax changes that coincide with bank tax changes. Columns 3 and 4 drops corporate tax changes
that coincide with the initiation of, or a change in, a tax credit program intended to stimulate either investment, R&D, or job creation. Columns 5 and 6 add state
tax base controls, following the approach in Suarez-Serrato and Zidar (2016). Columns 7 and 8 restrict the sample to border county pairs whose tax rates differ by
at most 20 basis points two years prior to treatment. Each specification includes a set of group-by-year fixed effects (as in Tables 3 and 4) to remove the influence
of time-varying shocks to local economic conditions. For variable definitions and details of their construction, see Appendix B. Standard errors clustered at the

Table 8. Business Cycle Effects.
We examine whether state corporate income tax changes have heterogeneous effects on employment and income depending on whether they are implemented
during recessions. Columns 1 and 2 split the sample according to whether a tax change comes into effect during a national recession year, as classified by the
NBER. Columns 3 and 4 split the sample according to whether a tax change occurs during a regional recession (with regions defined by the BEA), and columns 5
and 6 split the sample according to whether a tax change occurs during a state recession. Regional and state recessions are coded based on whether real personal
income (in the region or the state, respectively) has fallen for at least two quarters in the year prior to the tax change becoming effective. Each specification includes
a set of group-by-year fixed effects (as in Tables 3 and 4) to remove the influence of time-varying shocks to local economic conditions. For variable definitions
and details of their construction, see Appendix B. Standard errors clustered at the state level are shown in italics underneath the coefficient estimates. ***, **, and

Table 9. Proprietors’ Share, and Asymmetric Tax Rate Effects.
We examine whether state corporate income tax changes have heterogeneous effects depending on: the share of county
income that is not likely to be directly affected by corporate taxation (columns 1 and 2); and the level of state corporate
taxes prior to a tax change (columns 3 and 4). Since proprietors’ income tends to be taxed as personal rather than
corporate income, columns 1 and 2 split the sample according to whether a county’s share of nonfarm proprietors’
income relative to total income is above or below the national median among all counties one year earlier. To
investigate potential asymmetric effects based on the preexisting level of state corporate taxes, columns 3 and 4 split
the sample according to whether a county’s state corporate tax rate one year prior to a tax change is above or below
the national median among all counties. Each specification includes a set of group-by-year fixed effects (as in Tables
3 and 4) to remove the influence of time-varying shocks to local economic conditions. For variable definitions and
details of their construction, see Appendix B. Standard errors clustered at the state level are shown in italics underneath
the coefficient estimates. ***, **, and * denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level (two-sided), respectively.

Appendix Table 1. Robustness: Alternative Measures of Employment and Income.
This table presents regression specifications that are the same at Tables 3 and 4 using alternative measures of
employment (columns 1 to 3) and wage income (columns 4 and 6). Column 1 models the raw number of jobs, without
scaling by county population. Column 2 scales jobs by the number of county residents aged between 20 and 70.
Column 3 excludes government employment from our baseline employment measure, scaled by total county
population. Column 4 excludes income from government employment from our baseline wage income measure.
Column 5 returns to our baseline wage income measure but includes government transfer receipts (e.g., unemployment
insurance). Column 6 measures wage income by place of residence rather than by place of work. Each specification
includes a set of group-by-year fixed effects (as in Tables 3 and 4) to remove the influence of time-varying shocks to
local economic conditions. For variable definitions and details of their construction, see Appendix B. Standard errors
clustered at the state level are shown in italics underneath the coefficient estimates. ***, **, and * denote significance
at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level (two-sided), respectively.

Appendix Table 2. Labor Market Flexibility.
We examine whether state corporate income tax changes have heterogeneous effects on employment and wage income
depending on labor market flexibility. Columns 1 and 2 split the sample according to whether a county is located in a
right-to-work state (as detailed in Ellwood and Fine (1987) and updated by Matsa (2010)). Columns 3 and 4 split the
sample according to whether a county is located in a state whose private-sector unionization rate exceeds the national
median in the previous year (the data come from Hirsch and Macpherson (2003) as updated on their website,
www.unionstats.com). Each specification includes a set of group-by-year fixed effects (as in Tables 3 and 4) to remove
the influence of time-varying shocks to local economic conditions. For variable definitions and details of their
construction, see Appendix B. Standard errors clustered at the state level are shown in italics underneath the coefficient
estimates. ***, **, and * denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level (two-sided), respectively.

Appendix Table 3. Heterogeneous Effects by County Characteristics.
We examine whether state corporate income tax changes have heterogeneous effects on employment and wage
income based on county characteristics. In columns 1 and 2, counties are classified as either “rich” or “poor” based
on whether their per capita personal income is above or below the national median among all counties one year
earlier. In columns 3 and 4, counties are classified as having either high or low population density based on whether
their population per square mile is above or below the national median among all counties one year earlier. In
columns 5 and 6, counties are classified as having either high or low “small-business employment share” based on
whether the proportion of total county employment attributable to establishments with fewer than ten employees is
above or below the national median among all counties one year earlier (data are from County Business Patterns,
available only from 1974; the measure is constructed following Adelino, Schoar, and Severino (2015)). Each
specification includes a set of group-by-year fixed effects (as in Tables 3 and 4). For variable definitions and details
of their construction, see Appendix B. Standard errors are clustered at the state level. ***, **, and * denote
significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level (two-sided), respectively.
