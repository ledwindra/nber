    "abstract": "\n\nNL2SOL is a modular program for solving the nonlinear least-squares problem that incorporates a number of novel features. It maintains a secant approximation S to the second-order part of the least-squares Hessian and adaptively decides when to use this approximation. We have found it very helpful to \"size\" S before updating it, something which looks much akin to Oren-Luenberger scaling. Rather than resorting to line searches or Levenberg-Marquardt modifications, we use the double-dogleg scheme of Dennis and Mei together with a special module for assessing the quality of the step thus computed. We discuss these and other ideas behind NLZSOL and briefly describe its evolution and current implementation.\n\n",
