    "abstract": "\n\nWe introduce new historical administrative data identifying U.S. government-funded patents since the early twentieth century. In addition to the funding agency, the data report whether the government has title to the patent (\u201ctitle\u201d patents) or funded a patent assigned to a private organization (\u201clicense\u201d patents). The data include a large number of \u201clicense\u201d patents that cannot be linked to government funding from patent text or other sources. Combining the historical data with modern administrative sources, we present a public, consolidated data series measuring U.S. government-funded patents\u2014including funding agencies\u2014through 2020, and we provide code to extend this series in the future. We use the data to document long-run patterns in U.S. government-funded patents and federal patent policy, propose ways in which these data can be used in future research, and discuss limitations of the data.\n\n",
