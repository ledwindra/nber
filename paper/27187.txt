ABSTRACT
On April 7, 2020, Wisconsin held its presidential primary election, and news reports showed long
lines of voters due to fewer polling locations. We use county-level variation in voting patterns
and weekly county-level COVID test data to examine whether in-person voting increased
COVID-19 cases. We nd a statistically signi cant association between in-person voting density
and the spread of COVID-19 two to three weeks after the election. In our main results, a 10%
increase in in-person voters per polling location is associated with an 18.4% increase in the
COVID-19 positive test rate two to three weeks later.

Introduction

A headline on the New York Times website on April 7th , 2020, read, “Wisconsin Primary Recap: Voters
Forced to Choose Between Their Health and Their Civic Duty” (New York Times, 2020). The article
referenced long lines when voting, especially in Milwaukee, where only five polling places were open. The
lines were noted to be a serious cause for concern because the increased interactions could lead to increased
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and by extension COVID-19 cases.
It is now well established that increased social interactions increase the probability of the transmission of
the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Identifying the extent to which in-person voting in the Wisconsin election contributed
to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus has important policy implications in measuring the potential costs of
voting in-person during a pandemic, and by extension, the potential benefits of increased absentee voting
(voting-by-mail). In particular, the Wisconsin Election Commission enabled County and Municipal Clerks
to adjust the number of polling locations during the April 7th election. The results we provide here can
inform similar future decisions.
We estimate the relationship between in-person voting and the spread of COVID-19 using county-level
data. At the county level, we use information on both the number of tests for COVID-19 and number of
positive test results from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services to examine the relationship between
in-person votes per polling location and the spread of COVID-19. Our event-study results indicate that
trends in COVID-19 cases in counties with higher and lower levels of in-person voting per polling location
were similar in the weeks leading up to the April 7th election. However, counties with higher levels of inperson voting per polling location saw increases in the weekly positive rate of COVID-19 tests and weekly
new cases of COVID-19 in the weeks after the April 7th election. Moreover, this relationship is concentrated
in the counties in the upper tercile of the voters-per-location distribution. These findings are unlikely to be
a function of differing trajectories by population density, differing county-level demographics, or measures of
social distancing behaviors. Furthermore, this relationship suggests that it may be prudent for policy makers
and election clerks to take steps to either expand the number of polling locations, voting times, early voting
opportunities, or encourage curbside and absentee voting in order to keep the population density of voters
as low as possible.
To demonstrate that in-person voting was a mechanism for spreading COVID-19 we use cellphone location
data, combined with information on in-person voting and polling locations, to examine whether the April
7th election was related to increased visits to areas near polling locations relative to baseline behavior. Areas
around polling locations experienced a drastic increase in visits on April 7th , with no evidence of changes in
traffic to other locations on that day or changes in visits to areas near election locations on the days preceding

2

or following April 7th . Additionally, we illustrate a clear relationship between in-person votes cast and excess
visitation to areas near voting locations. Spikes in foot traffic to highly localized areas provide a mechanism
that supports the empirical relationship between in-person voting and the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
As we are investigating a potential link between behavior and the virus’s spread, we take a reducedform approach that builds on the general understanding that increased socialization is a primary vector
for transmission of the virus.1 Our strategy is very similar to other papers which examine associations
between the virus and various social factors, including the existence of and compliance with social distancing
orders, political orientation, public transportation, and occupation characteristics (e.g. Adolph, Amano,
Bang-Jensen, Fullman, and Wilkerson, 2020; Allcott, Boxell, Conway, Gentzkow, Thaler, and Yang, 2020;
Almagro and Orane-Hutchinson, 2020; Andersen, 2020; Bursztyn, Rao, Roth, and Yanagizawa-Drott, 2020;
Courtemanche, Garuccio, Le, Pinkston, and Yelowitz, 2020a,b; Dave, Friedson, Matsuzawa, McNichols, and
Sabia, 2020a; Feltham, Forastiere, Alexander, and Christakis, 2020; Friedson, McNichols, Sabia, and Dave,
2020; Harris, 2020; Kuchler, Russel, and Stroebel, 2020; Mangrum and Niekamp, 2020). In particular, we
build on work which examines the effects of potential “super-spreader” events on COVID-19 cases (e.g.
Dave, Friedson, Matsuzawa, Sabia, and Safford, 2020c; Dave, Friedson, Matsuzawa, McNichols, Redpath,
and Sabia, 2020b; Dave, Friedson, McNichols, and Sabia, 2020d).
In estimating the relationship between voting and the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as of May 15th , 2020,
the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WDHS) directly traced 71 confirmed cases of COVID-19
to in-person voting that occurred on April 7th .2 While this association presents some evidence of SARSCoV-2 spread in accordance with the Wisconsin election, the WDHS epidemiological investigation does not
necessarily reflect a definitive relationship. In particular, the presence of “community spread of infection”
means that people have been infected with the virus in an area, but they are not sure how or where they
became exposed or infected. Conversely, the investigation also missed cases caused by in-person voting
activity that were not successfully tested and traced by the state’s Department of Health (Associated Press,
2020). Hence, detailed contact tracing may not provide a full assessment of the impact that a particular
activity (e.g., in-person voting) has on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the number of COVID-19 cases.
Consequently, policy makers could be misled by limited studies using only test and trace methods to track a
1 The trajectory, number of cases, deaths, or the share of positive tests of the COVID-19 pandemic are often modeled by
larger structural models such as the highly publicized report from an Imperial College team, Flaxman, Mishra, Gandy, Unwin,
Coupland, Mellan, Zhu, Berah, Eaton, Perez Guzman et al. (2020), or alternatively, IHME and Murray (2020). These are
based to differing degrees on the “standard epidemiological model,” or SIR model. Please see Avery, Bossert, Clark, Ellison,
and Ellison (2020) for a COVID-19 related survey of these models.
2 Notably, according to media reports on July 20th, 2020, a poll worker in Piedmont, Alabama who worked the runoff election
on July 14th, 2020 tested positive for COVID-19 shortly after election day. Up to 475 people cast ballots at that Calhoun
County polling location and were potentially exposed. This situation is consistent with the hypothesis that large scale exposure
to SARS-CoV-2 is at least plausible in a voting context and further supports the need for empirical investigation of the issue
(Burkhalter (2020)).

link between COVID-19 and in-person voting. Our aim is to offer a general estimate of the increased spread
of infection, if any, related to in-person voting during a pandemic, and by extension provide insights into the
potential benefits of vote-by-mail.

Data

The timing of Wisconsin’s election, in conjunction with the spread of COVID-19 throughout the state, makes
it uniquely suited to offer relevant insights into the effects of voting on the spread of COVID-19. First, voting
took place during a “Safer at Home” order, where Wisconsin residents were restricted to essential activities
only, allowing for better identification of the effect of in-person voting (Evers and Palm, 2020). Second,
the “Safer at Home” order was issued only two weeks prior to the date of the election, on March 23, 2020,
making it difficult for all eligible voters to receive and return an absentee ballot before election day.3 And
third, the Wisconsin Elections Commission allowed County and Municipal Clerks to alter the voting setup
and number of voting locations at their own discretion in the weeks leading up to the election. Among
clerks who modified the voting locations available to their registered voters, nearly all sought to consolidate
– a decision that almost certainly increased the in-person voter density per voting location. Consolidation
was particularly salient in urban areas. For example, the city of Green Bay, WI (in Brown County), which
typically has 31 voting locations, had only two open during the April 7th election.

2.1

Voting Data

We use voting data provided by the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC). The WEC maintains a publicly
available database of official election results and voter participation metrics, all of which are available at
the county level.4 Of particular interest to this paper are the data on (1) total in-person votes, (2) total
absentee ballots requested, (3) total absentee ballots returned, (4) number of registered voters, and (5)
number of voting locations. Total in-person votes is the only item that is not directly reported by the WEC.
To measure this, we use official county-level vote data provided by the County Clerks for the State Supreme
Court seat election, adjusting for the number of over/under-votes, and then from that number subtract the
total absentee ballots returned.5
According to a memorandum released by the WEC on March 30, 2020, County and Municipal Clerks
3 On April 6, 2020 – the day before the election – Wisconsin governor Tony Evers issued an executive order that moved the
election to June 9, 2020. Later that same day, the State Supreme Court ruled that the Governor cannot unilaterally move the
date of an election, thus maintaining the in-person voting.
4 See https://elections.wi.gov/ for more information on these data.
5 If a number of absentee ballots are returned but not counted (an outcome we are unable to observe), then our measure of
in-person voting exposure would be biased downward.

expressed concern with hosting voters in buildings serving vulnerable portions of the population (e.g. nursing
homes, senior centers).6 As a result on March 12, 2020, the WEC gave County and Municipal Clerks the
ability to consolidate polling places. The decision to consolidate polling locations poses a unique problem
for Clerks: closing locations can create some insulation to the relatively vulnerable, but it also increases the
likelihood of infection at the remaining locations due to the increase in voter density.
Between March 12, 2020 and April 4, 2020, County and Municipal Clerks in 22 counties (of 72) consolidated the number of polling locations offered to voters, the average reduction among these counties being
approximately 15%. In total, Wisconsin used approximately 2200 voting locations for this election, each of
which can be categorized by the venue’s normal purpose. Statewide, approximately 90% of the voting locations were hosted in governmental buildings (e.g. city halls, fire stations), approximately 10% were hosted in
social or commercial locations (e.g. churches, VFWs, grocery stores), and 5% were hosted in local primary,
secondary, and post-secondary education buildings.7

2.2

COVID-19 Data

We use COVID-19 test data provided by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WDHS). The WDHS
maintains a database reporting the number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and the total number
of tests performed, which is updated daily. The primary items of interest from this database are (1) total
and new positive cases, (2) total and new negative cases, and (3) total and new COVID-19 tests performed,
each at the county level. While WDHS reports data for positive cases beginning on March 15, 2020, the
data for negative and total tests begin on March 30, 2020. Thus, from March 30, 2020 to May 17, 2020 (the
primary observation window of this study) we construct weekly measures of new COVID-19 cases and the
percent of total COVID-19 tests that are positive.
We aggregate COVID-19 testing data to the weekly level to account for within week patterns of testing
that vary by day of week and to eliminate noise associated with daily reporting at the county-level. We then
construct weeks from these dates as follows for our results incorporating the number of tests.
Week -1
March 30 - April 5

Week 0
April 6 - April 12

Week 1
April 13 - April 19

Week 3
April 27 - May 3

Week 4
May 4 - May 10

Week 5
May 11 - May 17

Week 2
April 20 - April 26

Week 0 contains the week of the April 7th election. To utilize the additional data available for (1) total and
new positive cases, we also estimate specifications only examining the number of positive cases. For these

specifications, we are able to introduce two more pre-election weeks, which we define as Week -3 (March
16 - March 22) and Week -2 (March 23 - March 29).

2.3

Demographics and Social Distancing Measures

In addition, we supplement voting and COVID-19 data with measures of social distancing and county-level
demographics.
We use SafeGraph Social Distancing Metrics data, which are collected from anonymized GPS pings
derived from smartphone app usage. The dataset provides daily metrics of human movement at a granular
level (precision within a 153x153 meter grid). We use median home dwelling time, percent of devices
completely home, and median distance traveled from home to provide a localized measure of social distancing.
While SafeGraph data are reported at the Census Block Group level by day, we aggregate the data to the
county by week level to match the level of COVID-19 and voting data.8
We also include a variety of other controls. From the US Census Bureau (2010 Census data), we control for
county population and population density. From the 2018 5-Year American Community Survey Estimates,
we control for the percent of the population without a high school degree, the percent of the population with
at least a bachelor’s degree, the 2018 unemployment rate, the median household income, and the percent of
the population age 65 or older.

2.4

Summary Statistics

Table 1 offers summary statistics on our primary measures relevant to the empirical analysis presented below.
Alongside state-wide reporting, we also split the summary statistics by counties which have above versus
below median numbers of in-person votes per polling location and provide t-statistics from difference-inmeans tests between these two groups of counties. This split shows that COVID-19 positive test rates are
approximately twice as high (5.6% versus 2.6%) in above-median counties. Individuals in above-median
counties are 2.4 percentage points (62.2% versus 64.6%) less likely to leave home and are approximately
7 percentage points (26.6% versus 19.6%) more likely to have at least a Bachelor’s degree. In addition,
above-median counties are higher income and have younger populations. There is a significant difference in
population density between above-median and below-median in-person vote counties (298.1 versus 34.3).
8 Social

distancing measures are lagged one week to account for the delay in detecting a COVID-19 infection after transmission.

Methods

To understand the impact of in-person voting on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 we focus on the percent of
COVID-19 tests that are positive in each county and week. We also extend our analysis to an investigation
of the effect of voting metrics on the number of new COVID-19 cases as well (see Section 4.2).
There are concerns that cases alone might not accurately measure the actual outbreak, as cases may be
affected by the implementation of COVID-19 testing and related capacity. Schmitt-Grohé, Teoh, and Uribe
(2020) document concerns that testing is not random and widespread. Almagro and Orane-Hutchinson
(2020) also recognizes this issue and as a result analyzes changes in the percentage of positive tests.9
In assessing what the appropriate model specification and design is for this investigation, we recognize
that there is a notable lag in the time between infection with the SAR-CoV-2 virus and its record (if any) in
the WDHS database. According to Lauer, Grantz, Bi, Jones, Zheng, Meredith, Azman, Reich, and Lessler
(2020), the median incubation period from infection with SARS-CoV-2 to onset of symptoms is approximately
five days, with 97.5% of infected people who are symptomatic exhibiting symptoms within 11.5 days. Once
symptoms occur, there are likely lags associated with seeking testing and acquiring lab results. The WDHS
provides data on cases by date of symptom onset, which, in aggregate, allow us to estimate the average lag
associated between onset of symptoms and a positive test showing up in the WDHS data. WDHS symptom
onset data provides new cases information by self-reported date of when an individual’s symptoms began,
rather than the date that positive test was recorded in the WDHS database following a positive PCR test.
In general, symptom onset date is meaningful because this date will be closer to the date when infection
occurred. Unfortunately, if symptoms onset date is missing, or if the patient was asymptomatic, rather than
omitting the cases from the onset data base (or imputing it), WDHS assigns the date in which the positive
diagnosis (PCR test) was recorded (e.g., these cases keep the recorded case date). This mis-coding introduces
bias to the measure, the extent of which is unknown.
Figure A4 plots the cumulative number of cases from the date of symptom onset and the date of COVID19 test reporting at the state level. Panel (a) of Figure A4 shows a notable relationship between these
measures exists, while panel (b) identifies the distribution of time lag (in days) between symptom onset and
positive case diagnosis. According to this measure the median lag from onset date to recorded positive date
is 7.5 days across the time series. Taken collectively with a median incubation period of 5.1 days, we would
expect any effects of the election on the COVID-19 outbreak on new cases to become most pronounced
9 Almagro and Orane-Hutchinson (2020) analyze the percent of positive tests, rather than the number of new cases, stating
“First, random testing has not been possible in NYC,10 as only those with certain conditions are tested because of limited
capacity. Second, Borjas (2020) points out that the incidence of different variables on positive results per capita is composed
of two things: A differential incidence on those who are tested, but also a differential incidence on those with a positive result
conditional on being tested. Therefore, we believe that the fraction of positive tests is the variable that correlates the most with
the actual spread of the disease within a neighborhood throughout our sample.” (p. 2)

around 12.6 days, or roughly two weeks, after the election.
Given these considerations, our primary analysis is an event study approach where we capture the impact
of in-person voting per location on the proportion of positive tests, or

Positive Ratec,t

= α + δIVLc + Weekt +

X

δt IVLc × Weekt

(1)

t=−1,1,...,5

+βXc + γSDc,t + c,t

where Positive Ratec,t is the proportion of positive cases in week t for each county c, IVLc is in-person votes
(in 1000s) per polling location and Weekt are weekly dummies, with the week of the election (April 7th)
serving as the reference (omitted) category t = 0. Our independent variables of interest are the interactions
between IVLc and Weekt . The coefficients on these variables, δt , provide estimates of the evolution of the
in-person votes per location in the week preceding the election and in the weeks after the election. Given
the incubation period of COVID-19, lags associated with seeking testing, and lags in labs acquiring results,
we should not see a relationship between voting behavior and the COVID-19 test rate prior to a week after
the election.
We also include other time-invariant county demographic controls in Xc , which we describe above. Further, we include county-level social distancing measures, including the SafeGraph measures of social distancing aggregated to the county by week level and lagged by one week (e.g., average time in dwelling, percentage
of time leaving home, and average distance traveled), and absentee votes per capita interacted with week,
which captures differences in social distancing behaviors specifically related to voting (and voters) across
counties and the corresponding effects over time. These measures are all represented in SDc,t . We also
show that estimates are robust to including an interaction between county population density and week,
which allows the evolution of COVID-19 in each county to vary by population density. Based on Papke
and Wooldridge (1996, 2008), we estimate models associated with equation (1) using a fractional logistic
regression model with robust standard errors clustered at the county-level.11 We also estimate equation (1)
where we replace all time-invariant county controls with county fixed effects. In these cases, we utilize OLS
estimation, owing to the incidental parameters problem.
11 Papke and Wooldridge (1996, 2008) note that the usual least-squares approach to estimating fractional response models
suffers from a retransformation problem in using the estimated parameters to infer the magnitude of responses. The implication
is that the usual marginal effects should be considered biased when calculated from estimates of the transformed model. They
instead suggest estimation directly by quasi-likelihood (e.g., fractional logistic regression).

Results

4.1

Results using COVID-19 Positive Test Rates

Table 2 and Figures 1a-1b show results from our models described in Equation (1). Columns (1) - (3)
of the table show logit coefficients, standard errors in parentheses, and marginal effects in brackets from
estimating fractional logit specifications. Moving from left to right, we systematically add in controls, with
those in Column (2) reporting our preferred specification. In Column (1) we begin with a parsimonious
model that accounts for time fixed effects and county demographic characteristics.12 Column (2) adds social
distancing measures, which include explicit measures of mobility tracked by cell-phone data and absentee
voting behaviors, and Column (3) adds in controls for the number of tests performed that week.13 In
Column (4) we change the regression to estimate an OLS model, including county fixed-effects into the
model to fully account for all time-invariant differences between counties. As this estimation is conducted
using OLS, the coefficients represent marginal effects, and we show standard errors clustered at the county
level in parentheses. In Figures 1a-1b, we graphically display the marginal effects and related 95% confidence
intervals of our preferred fractional logit specification in Column (2) and the OLS fixed effects estimate in
Column (4).
Across all models, we find an increase in the positive share of COVID-19 cases in the weeks following the
election in counties that had more in-person votes per voting location, all else equal. Except for Column (1),
the most parsimonious model, the marginal effects are similar in size two to three weeks after the election,
but begin to fade in subsequent weeks. The marginal effects two weeks after the election suggest that on
average every additional 100 voters per location (a tenth of a unit increase in voters per location) is associated
with an increase in the positive test rate in the preferred specification (Column 2) of about 0.043 percentage
points. Transforming this into an elasticity, a 10% difference in in-person voters per polling location between
counties is associated with approximately an 18% increase in the positive test rate.

4.2

Extension: COVID-19 Cases

Despite the aforementioned limitations of studying the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the number of
positive COVID-19 test cases reported (see Section 3), we nonetheless explore the effect of in-person voting
according to this measure. Doing so serves several purposes including (1) offering a robustness check of
our preferred measure of positive test rates, (2) providing a point of comparison to several studies using
this measure in other contexts (e.g. Courtemanche et al., 2020a,b; Dave et al., 2020a; Friedson et al., 2020;

0, the week of the election, serves as a reference category.
measures of testing may be endogenous, Almagro and Orane-Hutchinson (2020) argue that including measures of
testing are important as controls.
13 While

Mangrum and Niekamp, 2020), and (3) introducing two additional weeks of data to the beginning of our
time frame of study, a result that is due to the WDHS’s reporting of only positive test results prior to March
30th. Due to the additional data, we are able to extend our observation period prior to the election by two
additional weeks, thus introducing Week -2 (March 23 - March 29) and Week -3 (March 16 - March 22).
Given our interest in the number of positive COVID-19 test cases, we focus on estimating several models
according to

Casesc,t

= α + Weekt + χc +

−1
X

βt IVLc × Weekt +

t=−3

5
X

βt IVLc × Weekt

(2)

t=1

+σSDc,t + c,t

where Casesc,t represents one of three outcomes related to the number of positive cases in each county. The
first dependent variable we examine is the cumulative number of total cases per hundred people for each
county and week. Second, we examine the new weekly cases per capita, and third, we examine the log growth
rate in cases, defined as ln(Total Casesc,t ) − ln(Total Casesc,t−1 ).14 For these three outcomes, we estimate
OLS models.15 For each dependent variable, we examine weekly cases first as defined by the date of test,
and second by the date of symptom onset. The coefficients of interest in Equation (2) are again the βt ,
the coefficients on the interactions between IVLc and Weekt . As noted above, we are able to examine two
additional weeks in Equation (2) than in Equation (1) when not controlling for tests. The social distancing
controls are identical to those in Equation (1), except that we do not include any time invariant county
characteristics since they are absorbed by the county fixed effects χc .
Table 3 and the corresponding graphs shown in Figure 2 report the results from our models described in
Equation (2) using the WDHS’s recorded date of the positive COVID-19 test. Columns (1), (3) and (5) do
not control for the number of COVID-19 tests, while Columns (2), (4), and (6) do control for tests. Across
all specifications we find a similar pattern of results to those reported in Table 2: counties with greater voter
density experienced a greater number of COVID-19 cases, either measured by cases per hundred people, or
case growth rate. In particular, estimates indicate that an additional 100 voters per location (a tenth of a
unit increase in voters per location) is associated with a total of about 0.07 more total cases per 100 residents
in the average county five weeks after the week of the election. In looking at new cases per capita, every
100 voters per location is associated with an additional 0.02 new cases per 100 people three weeks after the
election. Notably, Columns (2), (4), and (6) demonstrate that controlling for the number of COVID-19 tests
run in each county does not change the magnitudes of our coefficients, but does notably improve estimation
14 As some counties had zero confirmed cases during our sample period and the natural log of zero is undefined, we add 0.001
to total cases before calculating log growth rates.
15 These estimates are robust to weighting by county population.

precision. Describing the results in terms of standard deviations, a one standard deviation increase in voters
per location leads to about a 0.7 standard deviation increase in total cumulative cases per hundred five weeks
later and about a 0.4 standard deviation increase in new cases per hundred five weeks later.16
Lastly, Table 4 presents results utilizing date of symptom onset instead of the recorded date of the
positive COVID-19 test.17 Given that symptoms can appear during the end of week 0 (election week),
for this analysis we use Week -1 as our reference week to allow for appropriate comparison.18 Results of
this analysis present a similar pattern to Table 3, however we find the differences in total cases begin to
appear nearly immediately. Further, new cases per 100 people are a near perfect mimic to the analogous
estimated presented using the record date data (in Column 3 of Table 3), but now leading by one week.
Overall, patterns are consistent with both the patterns seen using the recorded positive case data and with
how symptom-based timing should manifest with COVID-19 onset based on a clinical understanding of the
disease (Lauer et al., 2020).

4.3

Robustness of Estimates

In this section, we describe a series of robustness tests. First, even though we lag the Safe Graph social
distancing measures, it is possible that they could be endogenous regressors. Thus, in Appendix Table A1
we investigate the robustness of estimates to excluding the SafeGraph social distancing controls. Results are
highly robust to excluding these social distancing controls.
Second, although the main estimates presented in Tables 2 and 3 capture differences in population density
across counties, one may be concerned that the evolution of COVID-19 in each county may vary over time by
population density. Hence, in Appendix Table A2 we investigate the robustness of estimates to including an
interaction of county population density and week. Estimates are highly robust to this richer specification,
suggesting that main results are not driven by the evolution of cases with respect to population density
differences between counties.
In Figures 3a and 3b we investigate the sensitivity of the estimates in Tables 2 and 3 to systematically
excluding each of the 72 counties in Wisconsin one at a time. Specifically, estimates in Figure 3a show results
analogous to those presented in Column (2) of Table 2 for the parameter estimate of the interaction between
voter density and Week 3 after the election (e.g. 10.83) on the weekly positive test rate. Similarly, those
presented in Figure 3b are analogous to those presented in Column (2) of Table 3 for the parameter estimate
0.607 × 0.095
= 0.686 and 0.106 × 0.095
= 0.403.

data suffer from issues of testing associated with the recorded case data but also have some concerns owing to
systematic coding of symptom onset date as the date that the positive PCR test was recorded in situations where symptoms
information is missing or the case was asymptomatic and may be less reliable than the test record data (see Section 3).
18 The election occurred on the second day of week 0, so there is enough time for cases associated with the election to have
onset dates during Week 0.

of the interaction between voter density and week 5 after the election (e.g. 0.607) for total COVID-19
cases per hundred people. In each sub-figure, we order regressions to exclude counties in ascending order of
population. Overall the results are consistent to those presented in Tables 2 and 3, although estimated effects
on total cases (Figure 3a) are somewhat smaller when Brown, Milwaukee, or Racine Counties are excluded
from the sample. This is not unexpected given that these counties had some of the highest voter density
locations in the state, and suggests that the effect in larger more urban areas was likely more pronounced
than in the state overall and that effects may not be linear.
To further examine potential non-linearity in the relationship between in-person voter density and the
spread of COVID-19, we split our sample of counties into three subsamples: one for each tercile of in-person
voters per polling location (IVL). If transmission of the virus is focused in the most densely packed voting
locations, then the positive effects of IVL on COVID-19 should be driven by high IVL counties (tercile
three). Implementing the same event study specification used to create Figure 2a, we separately estimate
event studies for each tercile of IVL and plot estimates and standard errors in Figure 4. Estimates suggest
that the positive relationship between IVL and COVID-19 is driven by counties with the highest voting
density. While there is not a relationship between IVL and COVID-19 in terciles one and two (where mean
IVL ranges from 90 to 140), there is a strong relationship in tercile three where mean IVL is 280. These
results suggest that it is the most densely packed voting locations that are contributing to COVID-19 spread.

In-Person Voting as a Mechanism

Increased COVID-19 transmission associated with in-person voting should be driven by increased activity
above and beyond baseline activity observed in a community during the time period surrounding the election.
We observed a positive statistical relationship between county level in-person voting per location and COVID19 spread, but can we also observe localized mobility behaviors consistent with this finding? In attempting to
answer this question and, in doing so, more clearly link the relationship identified in Table 2 and Table 3 to
the April 7th election, it is useful to (1) demonstrate that behavioral differences in people’s mobility (namely,
activity levels) deviated from what was normal at and around the time of the election, (2) that observed
differences in behavior were focused at or near polling locations specifically, and (3) that these differences
were correlated with in-person voting density across counties. This evidence would more clearly establish
a behavioral link supporting the identified empirical relationship between in-person voting and COVID-19
outcomes, and, importantly, allow for the further exclusion of potentially unobserved correlated behaviors
outside of voting.
To attempt to measure deviations in baseline levels of activity, we utilize smartphone location data: Safe-

12

Graph Weekly Patterns data and SafeGraph Core Places data. Similar to the SafeGraph Social Distancing
Metrics discussed above, these datasets also use anonymized GPS pings from smartphones but provide device
counts to specific Points-of-Interest (POIs) for every day of the week. SafeGraph provides a 6-digit NAICS
code and a text string of the business or building name for every POI (e.g., restaurants, churches, shopping
malls, convenience stores, airports, and other commonly visited locations). After we merged this dataset
with SafeGraph POI data, these integrated data provide the coordinates of approximately 79,000 POIs in
Wisconsin. Hence, one can calculate the distance between each POI and the closest of the approximately
2,200 voting locations used in Wisconsin. Matching these three datasets allows for the measurement of
increases in traffic to highly localized voting locations that would not be visible in Social Distancing Metrics,
relative to increases in behavior to non-election sites. Isolating behavioral changes to those directly associated with voting more clearly indicates that other systemic correlated behavioral changes are not potentially
driving some or all of the findings.
Specifically, for approximately 79,000 points-of-interest (POIs), the ratio of visits on a date (e.g., April
7th) to visits that occurred seven days prior is calculated to estimate excess human activity above the
baseline. Figure 5a displays the mean ratio of visits to seven days prior by distance to the nearest poll.19
The data points for April 7th (Election Day) imply that POIs less than 50 meters from a voting poll received
over 3.5 times more foot traffic than the previous Tuesday. While POIs 50 to 100 meters and 100 to 200
meters from a voting location also exhibit excess visitation, the ratio of visits to seven days prior converges
to one as the distance from a POI to the nearest polling location increases. Estimates of excess visitation on
April 7th exhibit a strong distance gradient, firmly indicating that in-person voting caused a highly localized
increase in human activity above and beyond typical activity in the relevant time period of the election.
Figure 5a also plots the estimates of excess visitation for April 6th and 8th, the days surrounding voting
day. Averages of the ratio of visits to seven days prior hover tightly around one for all distances, mitigating
concerns that other events surrounding April 7th might drive results.20
Critically, we also observe a strong relationship between observed increases in localized human activity
near polling locations and rates of in-person votes cast. Figure 5b plots the mean of the ratio of visits to POIs
on April 7th to visits seven days prior relative to in-person votes per location, by county. The estimates of
excess visitation to POIs less than 50 meters from a polling location have a remarkably positive relationship
with voters per location, indicating more mobility in areas particularly close to a polling location. Focusing
on POIs less than 50 meters from a poll, counties with less than 200 voters per location averaged 1.8 times
19 For additional clarity, Appendix Figure A2a displays visits to POIs in Wisconsin for each of the fourteen days surrounding
April 7th.
20 For further support, Appendix Figure A3 reports estimates from event study specifications that compare visits to POIs
near versus far from polling locations.

more foot traffic than the previous Tuesday while counties with over 300 voters per location averaged 5.8
times more than the previous Tuesday.
These figures show that people’s level of activity changed considerably on April 7th, the change only
corresponded with traveling to the area of polls, and the degree to which the behavioral changes occurred
was highly correlated with in-person voters per location. Hence, deviations in COVID-19 transmission related
to deviations in in-person voting behaviors across locations do not appear to be related any other pattern
of behavior. Instead, they appear to be attributable to traveling to and congregating in the area of polling
locations themselves.

Conclusion

Using county level data from the entire state of Wisconsin, we analyze whether the election held in Wisconsin
on April 7, 2020 is associated with the spread of COVID-19.
Our results confirm the Wisconsin Department of Health Services findings on the link between the spread
of COVID-19 and voting using testing and tracing methods. However, the tracing investigation undertaken
was not comprehensive, and our results indicate a notable association between the concentration of inperson voters and positive test rates of COVID-19. Specifically, results show that counties which had more
in-person voting per voting location (all else equal) had a higher rate of positive COVID-19 tests than
counties with relatively fewer in-person voters. Furthermore, we also find a similar relationship between
in-person voter density voting and differences in COVID-19 cases directly. Moreover, we show that our
results are concentrated in the counties in the upper tercile of the voters-per-location distribution. These
findings are unlikely to be a function of differing trajectories by population density, differing county-level
demographics, or measures of social distancing behaviors.
Our overall results suggest that a 10% increase in voters per polling location leads to about an 18%
increase in the test-positive rate. When examining the number of cumulative or new weekly cases, we
find that a one standard deviation increase in voters per polling location is associated with a 0.7 standard
deviation increase in total cases per 100 people and a 0.4 standard deviation increase in new weekly cases
per 100 people.

An important policy consideration among County and Municipal Clerks is that of location consolidation
21 These results are consistent with estimates of the infection rate (R(t)) for the entire state of Wisconsin following the election
generated by the COVID Act Now project. In particular, this project uses a methodology for estimating the infection rate in
the state based on real time Bayesian estimation of epidemic potential of emerging infectious diseases (Bettencourt and Ribeiro,
2008). After adjusting for the lag in case reporting, primary infection resulting should from the election should have appear in
the state level data between April 14th and April 28th (Lauer et al., 2020). The COVID Act Now project estimates that the
infection rate increased in Wisconsin overall from 1.07 on April 14th to 1.17 on April 28th, with a peak of 1.19 on April 25th
(see https://covidactnow.org/us/wisconsin-wi?s=1115250).

for forthcoming elections, and the results reported here may aid in their decision on the matter. As discussed
in Section 2.1, when given the ability to modify the location of polling places at their own discretion, the
overwhelming majority of clerks that made changes chose to consolidate locations, which likely led to increases
in voter density per location. Our results show such an increase in density is associated with increase in the
rate of positive COVID-19 tests beginning two weeks following the election, consistent with the expected
amount of time that would pass between transmission of SARS-Cov-2 on April 7th and increased COVID-19
test results. Furthermore, we show that this finding is statistically significant at the 5% or 1% level across
different specifications. Likewise, the data support the hypothesis that voter density per polling location
will not vary with the positive rate in the week immediately preceding or during the the election, again as
expected, as neither parameter is significant as seen in Tables 2 and 3.
The relationship we find between COVID-19 and voting provides an additional piece of evidence towards
a causal link. Although our results are not definitive, they do suggest it may be prudent, to the extent
possible during the COVID-19 epidemic and weighed against other factors, for policy makers and election
clerks to take steps to either expand the number of polling locations, voting times, early voting opportunities,
or encourage curbside and absentee voting in order to keep the population density of voters as low as possible.
The above recommendations could be particularly beneficial in areas with high voter density and long wait
times, such as those often faced by urban voters and minority voters with substandard voting accessibility.

Notes: Data sources are identical to Table 1. The table shows logit coefficients, standard errors clustered at the county level in
parentheses, and marginal effects in brackets for the first four columns and OLS coefficients and standard errors clustered at the county
level in the last column. In-person voters per polling location are measured in 1000s of voters. Controls include county population,
population density, the percent of the population without a high school degree, the percent of the population with at least a bachelor’s
degree, the 2018 unemployment rate, the median household income, and the percent of the population age 65 or older. The Safegraph
Social Distancing Controls include median home dwelling time, percent of devices completely home, and median distance traveled from
home and are lagged by one week. Stars denote statistical significance levels: * 10% ** 5% and *** 1%.

Notes: Figures plot estimates and 95% confidence intervals from event study specifications, with POI fixed effects and day-of-panel
fixed effects, that compare visits to POIs near versus far from voting polls. The dependent variable is Ln(visitspt + 0.001), the natural
log (+ 0.001, to account for zeroes) of visits to POI p on date t. Each figure presents estimates from a separate regression where
treatment (whether a POI is within x kilometers of a voting poll) is defined by the distance in the caption. POIs that are closer to
polls than the treatment range, x, are removed from the samples of (b)-(f) to prevent contamination of the control group. Standard
errors are clustered at the county level. Data are from SafeGraph Core Places and Weekly Patterns. Results are robust to using a
FE Poisson model. Event study estimates clearly show a marked increase in foot traffic to POIs near voting polls, with effects that
dissipate quickly as “near” is defined more loosely.

Notes: For the number of positive cases on a given date, we count the number of days one must go back until the number of onset
cases is at least as large. Panel (b) then plots the distribution of these values. Data provided by the Wisconsin Department of Health
Services.
