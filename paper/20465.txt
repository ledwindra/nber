Subsidies and the Persistence of Technology Adoption: Field Experimental Evidence from
Mozambique

NBER Working Paper No. 20465
September 2014
JEL No. O13,O16,O33
ABSTRACT
We report the results of a randomized experiment testing impacts of subsidies for modern agricultural
inputs in rural Mozambique. One-time provision of a voucher for fertilizer and improved seeds leads
to substantial increases in fertilizer use, which persist through two subsequent agricultural seasons.
Voucher receipt also leads to large, persistent increases in household agricultural production and market
sales, per capita consumption, assets, durable good ownership, and housing improvements.
Consistent with learning models of the adoption decision, we find positive treatment effects on farmers'
estimated returns to the input package. We also document positive cross-household treatment spillovers:
one's own fertilizer use rises in the number of social network members receiving vouchers. Our findings
are consistent with theoretical models predicting persistence of impacts of temporary technology adoption
subsidies, in particular due to learning effects.

Introduction

Dierences in technology are widely believed to explain cross-country dierences
in per capita GDP (Caselli and Coleman (2001), Comin and Hobijn (2004)).
Given that the majority of the world's poor work in agriculture (IFAD (2011)),
much attention has been focused on adoption of modern agricultural inputs.
The substantial gains in agricultural productivity due to the Green Revolu-

1

tion involved introduction of improved seeds and modern fertilizers.

In this

context, Sub-Saharan Africa has proved to be an outlier: from 1960 to 2000,
it experienced the smallest increase in agricultural yields across regions of the
world (Evenson and Gollin (2003)). In 2009, fertilizer utilization in sub-Saharan
Africa averaged only 13 kilograms per hectare; by contrast, in other developing

2

countries the average was 94 kilograms per hectare.

Motivated by this disparity, many sub-Saharan African countries have embarked on perhaps the most signicant new development in agricultural policy
over the past decade: large scale input subsidy programs aimed at raising the
use of fertilizer and other modern inputs in agriculture. In ten African countries
implementing input subsidy programs, program expenditures in 2011 amounted
to $1.05 billion, or 28.6 percent of public expenditures on agriculture (Jayne

3

and Rashid (2013)).

The rapid spread of fertilizer subsidies has occurred alongside active debate
as to their desirability. Schultz (1964) argued that farmers are rational prot
maximizers who will choose optimal fertilizer use levels, so subsidies introduce
distortions and reduce social welfare. Other arguments against subsidies include
negative environmental externalities (WorldBank (2007)) and regressive distribution schemes resulting from political inuence and elite capture (Chibwana
et al. (2010), Pan and Christiaensen (2011), Lunduka et al. (2013)). Advocates
for subsidies point to market failures that would lead laissez-faire fertilizer use
levels to be less than socially optimal. Motivated in part by concerns about such
market failures, Sachs (2004) and Ellis (1992) have argued for fertilizer subsidies. In recent years, the World Bank has reversed previous decades' opposition
to subsidies and now provides budget support for fertilizer subsidy programs

Borlaug famously called high-yielding seed varieties the catalysts that ignited

the Green Revolution, and chemical fertilizers the fuel that has powered its forward thrust
(Borlaug 1972).

subsidies are not limited to Africa, of course. Indian fertilizer subsidies are also

substantial, amounting to 1.52 percent of GDP in 2008-09 (Sharma and Thaker (2009)).

4

(Morris et al. (2007)).

It is therefore important to shed light on the existence

of any market failures in this context, so that rationales for input subsidies can
be correctly evaluated.
We contribute to this debate on three fronts. First, we provide one of the
rst randomized controlled trials of the impact of an input subsidy program,
and the rst to measure impacts on a range of important household outcomes
beyond fertilizer use itself. The only previous study using randomized methods
is Duo et al. (2011), who estimate impacts of fertilizer subsidies on fertilizer
use alone (in rural Kenya).

We show positive impacts of input subsidies (in

Mozambique) on a range of outcomes beyond input use, including farm output,
household consumption, assets, and housing quality.
Second, we nd positive eects of input subsidies that persist up to two annual agricultural seasons beyond the season in which the subsidies were oered.
This result contrasts with Duo et al. (2011), who nd no persistent impact of
either heavy (50%) subsidies for fertilizer or the well-timed nudge of oering
free delivery at the time of the previous harvest. Both treatments raise fertilizer
use in the season they are provided, but impacts are very close to zero and not
statistically signicantly dierent from zero in the next season.
Third, we provide the rst eld experimental evidence of agricultural tech-

5

nology adoption spillovers within a social network.

Because the subsidy vouch-

ers were randomly assigned, our study also generated random variation in the
number of social network members (dened as those whom the respondent talked
with at least moderately about agriculture in the previous season) who also received the input subsidy voucher. We nd that one's own fertilizer use rises in
the number of social network members receiving the voucher.
Our results provide support for some classes of theoretical models of agricultural households, and evidence against others, thereby sharpening the types
of arguments that can (and cannot) be made in support of input subsidies. Our
ndings are consistent with models in which a one-time subsidy leads to persistent changes in technology adoption, such as models where subsidies create
wealth eects that promote adoption, or that involve learning about the returns

4 Duo

et al. (2011) provide experimental evidence from Kenya that farmers' behavioral

biases leading to under-investment in fertilizer can be overcome more cost-eectively with
well-timed small subsidies than large subsidies akin to those currently being implemented in
sub-Saharan Africa.

5 Previous

randomized studies of social network spillovers have focused on adoption of

health goods, and include Kremer and Miguel (2007), Dupas (2014), and Oster and Thornton
(2012). Observational studies of agricultural technology adoption include Bandiera and Rasul
(2006), Foster and Rosenzweig (1995), Conley and Udry (2010), and Munshi (2006).

to fertilizer. We provide such a model in Section 2 of the paper.
A number of patterns in our results are consistent with the subsidies operating via the learning channel. First, voucher winning leads study participants to
report higher estimated returns from use of the input package. In addition, the
eect of having voucher winners in one's social network is similar in magnitude
to the impact of winning a voucher oneself, and occurs only in years subsequent
to the voucher distribution season (after the results of fertilizer use by voucher
winners can be observed).
Our results are inconsistent with models where a one-time subsidy does not
lead to persistent technology adoption.

For example, a simple Ramsey-style

model without capital market imperfections and an optimal steady-state level
of input utilization would predict that a one-time subsidy would have only
a temporary eect, and that utilization would rapidly return to the steady
state.

Our results also are contrary to the prediction of a behavioral model

a la Duo et al. (2011), in which partially naïve farmers who face stochastic
temptation shocks systematically delay fertilizer purchases, so that some farmers
wait too long and run out of liquidity right before planting time and thus have
lower utilization than optimal. In such a setting, a one-time nudge or subsidy
raises adoption only in the current season, and is not persistent.

Similarly,

arguments that fertilizers are simply not protable at market prices because of
soil characteristics (Marenya and Barrett (2009)) imply that once-o subsidies
may have temporary, but not long-lasting, impacts.
Our work is related to existing research on market failures in technology
adoption. Past work has shown that technology adoption is inuenced by information imperfections, which lead to a need for learning about new technologies
(Munshi (2006), Foster and Rosenzweig (1995), Bandiera and Rasul (2006),
Conley and Udry (2010)); credit constraints (Miyata and Sawada (2007), Gine
and Klonner (2005)); and insurance market failures (Dercon and Christiaensen

6

(2007), Moser and Barrett (2006), Foster and Rosenzweig (2009)).

Experimen-

tal research on the persistence of technology adoption in response to short-term
subsidies for health goods is also related (Kremer and Miguel (2007), Dupas
(2014), Tarozzi et al. (2014)).
In the rest of this paper, we rst outline a simple theory that generates
persistence of adoption in response to a one-time subsidy (Section 2). We then
describe the study setting and experimental design in Section 3.

and Rosenzweig (2010) review the technology adoption literature in economics,

including studies of fertilizer adoption.

we present the empirical results, and then conclude in Section 6.

A Model of the Impact of One-time Input Subsidies on Technology Adoption

This section puts forward an economic model that allows us to explore the interaction between protability, liquidity and information constraints on the use
of fertilizer and improved seeds. The model provides a sharper understanding
of when and how one-time input subsidies might spur sustained adoption of
improved technologies and helps structure our subsequent empirical analysis.
The model assumes that households are risk averse, lack access to capital markets and are unable to borrow to nance the adoption of an improved
agricultural technology. To cut down on verbiage, we will simply refer to this
technology as fertilizer. Specically, the model demonstrates:
1. Absent an input subsidy, a non-adoption equilibrium can emerge if initial
living standards are low, especially if beliefs about the distribution of
returns to fertilizer are downwardly biased or diuse.
2. A one-time subsidy on the price of the new technology can move (some)
otherwise non-adopting households to adopt the new technology.
3. If the subsidy-induced adoption does not have any learning eects, then
technology adoption may persist after expiration of the subsidy through a
pure wealth eect. This wealth eect is stochastic (dependent on realized
returns to fertilizer) and sustained adoption under it may be fragile in
the sense that poor outcomes can lead to subsequent reversion to the no
fertilizer equilibrium.
4. Sustained adoption becomes more likely (and stable) if the wealth eect
is accompanied by positive learning eect of one-time subsidies. Positive
learning can occur through a reduction in pessimism about expected returns to fertilizers as well as through a reduction in the diuseness or
spread of beliefs about the distribution of fertilizer returns.
After laying out our core model assumptions, this section will rst consider the
impact of fertilizers on the short- and long-run adoption of fertilizers in the
absence of learning.

We will then open the model to learning and consider

4

the additional insights and implications of temporary vouchers on sustained
technology adoption. The Appendix explores learning about diuseness.

2.1 Technology and Subjective Beliefs
We model the behavior of agricultural households that are risk averse and lack
access to contracts for both insurance and credit. We assume that traditional
production technology does not require purchased inputs and provides a xed,
non-stochastic output,

x̄.

Households can choose to augment the traditional

technology with a divisible improved technology that utilizes a purchased input

f

x̄+yf , where y is the random return per unit
[y− , y + ],
7
with probability distribution φ and with Eφ [y] = ȳ . Normalizing the price of
the agricultural output to 1 and denoting the market price of fertilizer as pf ,
(fertilizer) and produces output,

fertilizer and we assume that it is distributed over the closed interval

note that absent subsidy, the technology will be is protable in expectation if

ȳ > pf .
We justify this constant marginal impact of fertilizer via an eciency wage
theory of plant growth such that a given an amount of fertilizer is applied to an
optimal area/number of plants, yielding a constant (expected) output increment
per-unit fertilizer.

8

Spreading this amount of fertilizer across a larger area

will decrease returns.

Note that this perspective is consistent with standard

fertilizer practice which is to concentrate a limited amount of fertilizer in a
small area, rather than spreading it out so that each plant gets only some tiny
amount. Importantly, this production specication means that marginal returns

9

to fertilizer are always nite, even at low levels of use.

As we are interested in the behavior of farm households that largely lack
prior experience using the improved technology, we assume that farmers lack
full information on the true distribution of

y.

In the simplest case, we assume

that farmers correctly understand the dispersion in returns to the improved
technology, but are systematically biased in their beliefs about the level of those

7 Strictly

speaking, this assumption applies only up to the point where the total amount of

fertilizer exceeds the optimum amount for total farm size. We will ignore this eventual drop
in returns to fertilizer as even the voucher program under study provides fertilizer well short
of the optimum amount for the total cultivated area of households in our sample.

8 Specically

we assume that plant yields are unresponsive at low levels of fertilizer or

plant nutrition, and then have an increasing returns portion followed by a diminishing returns
portion. As in the nutrition-based eciency wage theory, this relationship will pin down a
unique level of fertilizer that maximizes returns.

9 Note

that the same logic applies to improved seed as a small quantity of improved seeds

will boost yields in the small area where they are planted, but cannot be ground up and spread
out over the entire cultivated area for higher returns.

are driven by a random variable
perceived returns.

we denote the bias as

dene beliefs as pessimistic if

For the case in which priors are not diuse, but are biased, we can write

φ0 (ỹ) = φ(y +B0 ). Denote the corresponding subjective cumulative distribution
Φ0 . The appendix below generalizes this specication and allows

function as

uninformed farmers to have relatively diuse prior beliefs about the distribution
of returns to fertilizer.

2.2 Technology Adoption in the Short and Medium Run
without Learning
In order to isolate the liquidity from the learning eects of voucher coupons,
we rst consider their impact assuming that no learning takes place. The next
section will consider what happens when households update their priors about
returns to fertilizers.
Consider a 3-period model of an agricultural household that produces and

10

consumes the agricultural commodity.

We assume that the household is of-

fered a once-o input subsidy in in period 1 that reduces the cost of fertilizer
from

pf

to

pf − v ,

where

v

is the voucher value. After period 1, the voucher ex-

pires and the price of fertilizer returns to its xed market price of

pf .

To explore

the impact of this temporary fertilizer voucher subsidy, we consider the following model of an agricultural household that chooses how much to invest in rst
and second period savings (s1 , s2 ) and fertilizer (f1 , f2 ) in order to maximize
expected utility given its prior subjective beliefs about the returns to fertilizer:

maxf1 ,s1 ,f2 ,s2 u(c1 ) + βE0 [u(c2 ) + βu(c3 )]
subject to :
c1 ≤ z0 − (pf − v)f1 − s1
c2 ≤ x̄ + y1 f1 − pf f2 + rs1 − s2
c3 ≤ x̄ + y2 f2 + rs2
f1 , s1 , f2 , s2 ≥ 0
10 The

(1)

assumption of only 3 periods, with households consuming all cash on hand in period

3, is of course limiting, but it is sucient to allow us to garner key insights on short and
medium term technology adoption.

where

β = (1 + δ)−1

is the per-period discount factor,

hand for the household,

y1

and

y2

z0

is initial cash on

represent the realized returns to fertilizer in

production periods 1 and 2, respectively, and

r

is the xed interest rate factor

for rst and second period savings. Given that returns to informal savings are
low or even negative, we will assume that the households are impatient in the
sense that

βr < 1.

Under this assumption, households will only use nancial

savings to smooth consumption between periods, but not to build wealth.

2.2.1 Second Period Problem
We begin by examining second period choice conditional on realizations from the
rst year crop yield. Dene second period cash-on-hand as

z2 = x̄ + y1 f1 + rs1 .

Note that second period cash on hand only depends on period 1 decisions and
realizations. We can write the conditional second-period value function as:

V2∗ (z2 ) ≡ maxf2 ,s2 u(c2 ) + βE0 [u(c3 )]
subject to :
c2 ≤ z2 − pf f2 − s2
c3 ≤ x̄ + y2 f2 + s2
f2 , s2 ≥ 0

(2)

The Kuhn-Tucker conditions for this problem are:

dV2
= βE0 [y2 u03 ] − u02 pf ≤ 0;
df2
dV2
= βrE0 [u03 ] − u02 ≤ 0;
ds2

f2

dV2

=0
df2
dV2
s2

(3)

As can be seen from these conditions, the key comparison determining fertilizer

0

use is the comparison of the expected benets (E0 [y2 u3 ]) to the shadow price

0

of liquidity (u2 pf ) and returns to savings,

r.

Analysis of this problem simplies when the rst order conditions are eval-

f2 = 0. At this value, third period cash
u03 independent of the random variable y2 .
(f2 = 0), the household will only set f2 > 0 if

uated at the corner solution value of

the following expression is true:



The rst term on the right hand side says that expected returns under fertilizer
must exceed the shadow price or opportunity cost of liquidity, while the second
says that discounted expected returns to fertilizer must exceed returns to savings
if any funds are to be invested in fertilizer.

If this condition does not hold,

then fertilizer adoption will never be sustained in the second period. That is,
consumption will be smoothed using the available savings technology.
Assuming that expected returns to fertilizer exceed the returns to savings,
E0 [y2 ]
> r, then we can dene a critical level of cash on hand,
pf

z̃2 = {z2 |βu03 E0 [y2 ] = pf u02 (z2 )} ,
such that the individual is just indierent between adopting and not adopting

f2 , s2 = 0 increases

the improved technology in period 2. At the corner solution
in

z2

will only aect the shadow price of liquidity

values of values

z2 > z̃2 ,

the individual will optimally adopt the new technology

f2 > 0), whereas no adoption will occur for lower values of z2 .
Using z̃2 , note that for any prior choices of f1 and s1 we can dene the
minimum period 1 fertilizer returns necessary to give cash on hand of z̃ and to
(i.e., set

sustain fertilizer adoption s:

y(f1 , s1 ) ≡

(z̃2 − x̄ − rs1 )
.
f1

Absent learning, y(f1 , s1 ) is the minimum rst period returns to fertilizer that
must be realized in order or the household to sustain the adoption of the new
technology in period 2. Note that y is decreasing in both of its arguments. A
fertilizer subsidy that induces rst period adoption of fertilizer thus creates a
potential wealth eect that sustains fertilizer adoption in the second period by
simply pushing net wealth or cash on hand above the minimum level
what follows, we will assume that

z̃ > x̄.

z̃2 .

In

2.2.2 First Period Problem
Using the value function dened by 2, we can now examine the rst period
problem as:

maxf1 ,s1 V1 (z0 ) ≡ u(c1 ) + βE0 [V2∗ (z2 )]
subject to :
c1 ≤ z0 − (pf − v)f1 − s1
z2 = x̄ + y1 f1 + rs1
f1 , s1 ≥ 0

(4)

In general form, we can write the rst order conditions with respect to

s1

as:

β

f1

∂E0 [V2∗ ]
− u01 (pf − v) ≤ 0
∂f1
.
∂E0 [V2∗ ]
β
− u01 ≤ 0
∂s1

and

(5)

These conditions broadly mimic the conditions for the second period problem
(3) except for two important dierences. First the subsidy

v

lowers the shadow

price of a unit of fertilizer, making adoption of an interior solution with

f1

more

likely. Second, the expected gains from fertilizer or savings are more complex.
To explore these expected gains, it is useful to break apart the second compo-

Φ0 is the cumulative distribution for prior subjective beliefs, we dene Φy = Φ0 [y(f1 , s1 )] =
P rob(y1 > y(f1 , s1 )) and rewrite the second component of the maximand (4)
nent of the maximand in (4) above into two pieces. Recalling that

as:

E0 [V2∗ (z2 )] = (1−Φy ) {E0 [V2∗ (z2 ) | y1 < y(f1 , s1 )]}+Φy {E0 [V2∗ (z2 ) | y1 > y(f1 , s1 )]} .
Denote the rst term in curly brackets as
as

B.

Note that

A and the second term in curly brackets

B ≥ A.

Using this expression, we can, for example, rewrite the rst order condition
with respect to

f1

as:





∂Φy
∂Φy
β (1 − Φy )A0 −
A + β (Φy )B 0 +
B − u01 (pf − v) ≤ 0.
∂f1
∂f1
with a similar expression for the the derivative of

V1

with respect to

s1 .

Because

it is the corner condition at no fertilizer use that will determine adoption of the
new technology, we again evaluate the rst order conditions at

0
corner solution, note that u2 is non-stochastic and that

9

f1 = 0.

Φy = 0,

At this

allowing us to

rewrite conditions (5) as:

Note that with

B > A, application of fertilizer not only has

direct, short-term eect on second period well-being, but also an option value
eect as it probabilistically opens the door to period 2 fertilizer investment and
improved third period well-being.
As with the second period problem, there will be a critical minimum amount
of cash-on-hand above which adoption occurs (if augmented expected returns
exceed

r).

Note that this minimum level decreases with the magnitude of the

z̃0 (v). Note also that pessimism about the returns to
B0 which decreases E0 [y1 ]) will make it less likely
fertilizer will increase z̃0 (v) and make it less likely that fertilizer will be adopted

subsidy and denote it as

fertilizer (a larger value of

even with subsidy.

2.2.3 Sustained Adoption and Disadoption
We are now in a position to examine the economics of fertilizer adoption. Drawn
for a given set of initial beliefs, Figure 1 partitions the space dened by initial
cash on hand (z0 ) and stochastic rst period fertilizer returns (y1 ) into three
areas. The rst area is for all households with initial cash on hand less than the
minimum necessary to invest in fertilizer (z0

z̃0 (v = 0),

< z̃0 (v)).

If we assume that

x̄ <

then it is reasonable to assume that most households will not adopt

fertilizer absent a subsidy.

As the subsidy increases, the dashed vertical line

in Figure 1 will shift to the left, crowding in more rst period experimentation
with fertilizer.
For those that adopt fertilizer in period 1, two outcomes are possible.

If

returns are high enough to push second period cash on hand above the critical
level z, then adoption of the technology will be sustained. Given that returns
to fertilizer are stochastic, note that those who sustain technology adoption
will be only a subset of those who adopted it in period 1, with the second
period adoption probability being an increasing function of rst period fertilizer
returns. The solid downward sloping curve in Figure 1 displays the values of

z0

and

y1

such that the household is just indierent between disadoption and

sustained second period adoption. Those above the curve will continue to use

For those with less buoyant rst period returns (y1

< y(z0 )), disadoption will
Note that some of these households (with 0 < y1 < y) may boost savings

in order to smooth consumption between periods 2 and 3.

However, without

more optimistic expectations about the returns to fertilizer, these households
will not continue to adopt fertilizer beyond the subsidy period.

2.3 Technology Adoption in the Presence of Learning
The analysis so far has assumed that expected returns to fertilizer are unchanged
by experience with the voucher coupons. However, individuals can learn from
their own experience using fertilizers in period 1, as well as from the experience

y1 denote the returns to fertilizer
1, we dene the information content of this
∗
information as y1 = y1 − E0 (ỹ). Similarly, let y1n be the yields that member
n of the farmer's social network obtained using fertilizer in period 1 and the
∗
information content as y1n = y1n − E0 (ỹ). Assuming that the farmer has N1
of others in their social network.

Letting

network members using fertilizer in period 1, then we can dene the information

11

content of the signal that the farmer receives from the network as:

∗
y1N

=


N 
X
y1n − E0 (ỹ)

n=1

.

From a Bayesian learning perspective, the farmer will update the bias in
prior beliefs about returns to fertilizer (B0 ) based on the strength of prior be-

∗

2

liefs (σB ), the new information received (y1 and
0

∗
, y1n
),

and the variance or

2
precision of that new information (σy ∗ ). Assembling these pieces, we posit a
1n
∗
2
∗
2
learning model in which B1 = B0 + f (y1 , σB , y1n , σy ∗ ). Foreshadowing the
0

1n

later empirical analysis in which we lack many of these specic measures, we
note that the relative precision of the information received from the network
depends on

N,

the number of network members experimenting with fertilizer.

In simplest terms, we can rewrite the update equation as
where

d

B1 = B0 + f (d1 , N1 ),

is a binary indicator of whether or not the farmer experimented with

fertilizer in period 1.
How then does learning aect the use of fertilizer? To keep things (relatively)
simple, we assume that learning is unanticipated, meaning that rst period
decisions are not aected by learning. However, realized fertilizer outcomes in
excess of prior expectations will boost expected returns, lowering

shown by the dashed curve in Figure 1. Conversely, negative information shocks

will shift the curve in the opposite direction, making sustained

adoption less likely. Note that from a longer term perspective, positive learning
about the returns to fertilizer would be expected to inoculate future behavior
against disadoption following a single bad realization that reduces household
liquidity, implying greater stability in adoption.
One thing to notice here is that realized returns (y1 ) for the adopting household generates both a wealth eect and a learning eect.

Without imposing

further structure, an empirical nding that the farmer's own experimentation
enhances future adoption would not cleanly identify whether such a persistent
eect is the result of liquidity or learning eects, or some combination of the
two. In contrast, experimentation by others in the farmer's social network would
be expected to only inuence farmer learning and not his or her liquidity.

Project Description

3.1 Agriculture in Mozambique and Input Subsidies in the Region
Following its independence in 1975, Mozambique experienced 15 years of civil
war. Despite impressive GDP growth since the end of the civil war, it remains
one of the poorest countries in the world.

In 2011, its Human Development

Index was ranked 184th out of 187 countries rated.

More than 75% of the

Mozambican population works in small-scale agriculture, with little to no use
of tractors, ploughs, fertilizer, pesticides, irrigation and other agro-inputs. The
most common crops include maize, cassava, sweet potatoes, cotton, tobacco,
sesame and groundnuts. The use of mineral fertilizer among smallholder farmers is primarily limited to cash crops and is scarce on cereal crops, leading to low
yield, generally below one ton per hectare for maize production (compared to up
to 8 tons per hectare in the most productive developing countries). The nascent
input market is small and its network sparse. Between 1996 and 2003, agricultural production grew by an average of 6% per year, leading to a decrease in the
rural poverty headcount, from 69% to 54% during the same period. However,
Nankani et al. (2006) note that this growth mainly resulted from the expansion
of area cultivated and labor due to the return of migrants, while technological
improvements have been modest and yields almost stagnant.
In the 1970s and early 1980s in a majority of African countries, fertilizer
was subsidized and sold through state-owned enterprises to address perceived
under-provision of fertilizer by the market.

Most public monopolies of agro-

inputs were eliminated during structural adjustment programs in the late 1980s.
In the late 1990s, agro-input subsidies have re-emerged as what are now called
 smart subsidies. Typically, vouchers are distributed to poor farmers, giving
them access to an agro-input package provided by private sector input dealers
at a subsidized price.

Private sector dealers then trade the vouchers against

the amount of the subsidy, at an intermediary bank or agency.

This scheme

has been claimed to oer the advantages of traditional fertilizer subsidy while
stimulating rather than undermining the private sector, and targeting the poor
more eectively. On the other hand, some have criticized failures in targeting
the poor, and the low cost-eectiveness of the intervention (Minot and Benson,

11

2009).

high-level reviews of input subsidy programs, also see Morris et al. (2007), Minot

(2009), Druilhe and Barreiro-Hurle (2012), and Jayne and Rashid (2013).

3.2 Project Overview and Research Design
The study that is the subject of this paper is nested within a larger study of
the impact of input subsidies, formal savings programs, and the interaction of
subsidy and savings programs. Localities in Manica province were selected to
be part of the larger study on the basis of inclusion in the provincial input
voucher program as well as access to a mobile banking program run by Banco
Oportunidade de Mocambique (BOM, our implementation partner for the savings component of the project). To be accessible to the BOM savings program,
which involved scheduled weekly visits of a truck-mounted bank branch, a village had to be within a certain distance of a paved road and within reasonable
driving distance of BOM's regional branch in the city of Chimoio. These restric-

12

tions led to inclusion of 94 localities

in the larger study, across the districts of

Barue, Manica, and Sussundenga.
Each of the selected 94 localities was then randomly assigned to either a no
savings condition or to one of two savings treatment conditions (basic savings
and matched savings), each with 1/3 probability. The 32 localities (with 41
component villages) randomly selected to be in the no savings condition did

13

not experience any savings treatment, and are the subject of this paper.

Unlike many of its neighbors that launched nationwide input subsidy pro-

14

grams,

Mozambique piloted a limited, two-year subsidy program funded by

the European Union, implemented by Mozambique's Ministry of Agriculture,
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Fertilizer
Development Center (IFDC). The limited scope of this program allowed the
research team, in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture and IFDC, to
design and implement a randomized controlled trial of the program. Over the
2009-10 and 2010-11 seasons, the pilot targeted 25,000 farmers nationally, of
which 15,000 received a subsidy for maize production, and the remaining 10,000
received a subsidy for rice production. Among the recipients of the subsidy for
maize production, 5,000 were in Manica province (in central Mozambique along

12 The

localities we use were dened by us for the purpose of this project, and do not

completely coincide with ocial administrative areas. We sought to create natural groupings
of households that had some connection to one another.

In most cases our localities are

equivalent to villages, but in some cases we grouped adjacent villages together into one locality,
or divided large villages into multiple localities.

13 In

a separate companion paper, the remaining 62 localities randomly assigned to one of

the savings treatments will be combined with the 32 no savings localities in analysis of the
interaction between savings and input subsidy programs. Farmers in the 62 savings program
localities were also included in lotteries for input vouchers.

and Chirwa (2011)).

the Zimbabwean border), where the study was implemented.
Mozambique's input subsidy program provided beneciary farmers with a
voucher subsidizing the purchase of a technology package designed for a half
hectare of improved maize production: 12.5 kg of improved seeds (either openpollinated variety or hybrid) and 100 kg of fertilizer (50 kg of urea and 50 kg of
NPK 12-24-12). The market value of this package was MZN 3,163 (about USD
117), of which MZN 2,800 was for the fertilizer component, and MZN 363 was
for the improved seed. Farmers were required to co-pay MZN 863 (USD 32), or

15

27.2% of the total value of the package.

Lists of eligible farmers were created jointly by government agricultural extension ocers, local leaders, and agro-input retailers. Individuals were deemed
eligible for a voucher coupon if they met the following program criteria: 1) farming between 0.5 hectare and 5 hectares of maize; 2) being a  progressive farmer,
dened as a producer interested in modernization of their production methods
and commercial farming; 3) having access to agricultural extension and to input and output markets; and 4) being able and willing to pay for the remaining
27% of the package cost. Only one person per household was allowed to register.
Participants were informed that a lottery would be held and only half of those
on the list would win a voucher. Vouchers were then randomly assigned to 50%

16

of the households on the list in each village.

Randomization was conducted

by the research team on the computer of one of the PIs, and the list of voucher
winners was provided to agricultural extension ocers. Extension ocers were
responsible for actual voucher distribution to beneciaries.
The annual agricultural season in Mozambique runs from November (when
planting starts) through harvest the following June. The timing of the intervention and various surveys was largely determined by this annual cycle. The
schedule of specic project activities was as follows:

•

Sept-Dec 2010: Random assignment and distribution of vouchers

•

April 2011: Survey to establish voucher use and agricultural outcomes in

prior season

•

September 2011: First follow-up survey

•

September 2012: Second follow-up survey

15 At

the time of the study, one US dollar (USD) was worth roughly 27 Mozambican meticals

(MZN).

16 In

other words, villages served as stratication cells.

August 2013: Third follow-up survey

Sample, balance tests, and attrition

Our sample for analysis in this paper consists of 514 study participants and their
households in 41 villages (in 32 localities or groupings of villages). In each one
of these villages, 50% of study participants were randomly selected to receive
an input voucher.
Table 1 provides summary statistics on the study households, and tests for
balance on these variables across study participants in the treatment (voucher
winners) and control (voucher losers) groups. Sample household heads are 85%
male and 78% are literate. By comparison, in rural Manica province, only 66% of

17

household heads are male and 45% are literate.

This is perhaps not a surprise

given the initial intention of targeting progressive farmers. Study households
own an average 10.3 hectares of land (the sample median is 5 hectares). 11% of
households have electricity at home, and 19% used fertilizer on at least one of
their maize elds during the 20092010 season, prior to this study. While better
o than some in the province, the study population is nonetheless dominated
by poor small-scale farmers with limited experience with modern agriculture.
Due to uncertainties in the timing of voucher distribution and delays in the
creation of the list of study participants, it was not feasible to conduct a baseline
survey prior to the voucher lottery.

Instead, we implemented a survey after

the distribution of vouchers, but asked retrospective questions on respondents'
pre-lottery agricultural outcomes and behaviors.

We check balance between

treatment and control groups for variables that are not expected to vary in the
short run (for example education of the household head), or variables related to
the 2009-10 agricultural season (the season prior to our study.) The rightmost
columns of Table 1 present the means of these variables in the control and
treatment groups separately, and the p-values of F-tests of equality of these
means. The sample is balanced on all of these variables.
It is important to consider attrition from the study, and consider whether
such attrition could lead to biased treatment eect estimates.

We attempted

to survey everyone in the initial sample at each subsequent survey round (in
other words, attrition was not cumulative), so all attrition rates reported are

17 The

Manica data used for comparison is from the 2007  Terceiro Recenseamento Geral da

População e Habitação , provided by Mozambique's National Institute of Statistics, accessible

vis-à-vis that initial sample. Attrition is 8.6% in the rst (2011) follow-up survey, 10.0% in the second (2012) round, and 7.6% in the nal (2013) round. In
Online Appendix Table 1, we examine whether attrition is related to treatment
assignment. The regressions of the table regress the dummy for treatment (winning the voucher lottery) on attrition, controlling for village xed eects. In no
case is attrition large or statistically signicantly dierent from zero. Attrition
bias is therefore not likely to be a concern in this context.

Empirical results

Random treatment assignment allows us to estimate the causal impact of eligibility for fertilizer subsidy vouchers. Treatment eect estimates for outcome
for study participant

in village

are obtained via estimation of the following

regression equation:

Yiv = α + βZiv + θv + iv

(6)

Because use of the voucher is potentially endogenous to farmer characteristics, we focus on the impact of exogenously-determined treatment status. Our
estimates will be intent to treat (ITT) eects of voucher receipt on the outcomes
of interest.

Ziv

is an indicator variable taking the value of 1 if the individual is

in the treatment group (won the lottery for the fertilizer subsidy voucher), and
0 otherwise.

The parameter of interest is the coecient

on this treatment

indicator, the estimate of the treatment eect of subsidy voucher receipt. The
regression variables do not have time subscripts: we run this regression separately for outcomes in each of the three annual post-treatment follow-up surveys
that we implemented. This allows examination of changes in the treatment effect over time.

θv

are stratication cell xed eects representing the village of the study

participant (recall that treatment was randomly assigned within village, so each
village contains both treated and control study participants.) We report Huber/White heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors.
Outliers may have undue inuence on the treatment eect estimates for
certain variables (such as fertilizer utilization in kilograms, or production in
kilograms or money units). We take two approaches to reduce the inuence of
outliers.

First, we take the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation (IHST) of

17

18

dependent variables.

Second, when expressing certain variables in levels, we

truncate the variable at the 99th percentile (we replace values above the 99th
percentile with the 99th percentile). The results tables will always show both
IHST and levels (with 99th percentile truncation) specications.
Outcome variables of particular interest in this study include those that
have substantial noise and relatively low autocorrelation, such as farm inputs
and outputs. In this case, one can achieve increases in statistical power by taking multiple post-treatment outcome measures and estimating treatment eects
on the average of post-treatment outcomes across multiple periods (McKenzie
(2012)). We therefore also show impacts on average outcomes across the 2012
and 2013 seasons, which follow the treated 2011 season for which the input
vouchers were distributed.

5.1 Voucher Take-up
19

We rst examine take-up of the subsidy voucher.

An important rst point

to note is that there was non-compliance in both the treatment group and in
the control group: in the treatment group, not all voucher winners used the
voucher, and some farmers in the control group received the voucher.
Our study took place in the context of a government fertilizer voucher program, so distribution of vouchers to study participants was the responsibility
of government agricultural extension agents (not our research sta ). Under the
supervision of the research team, extension agents held a voucher distribution
meeting in each village to which all voucher winners in that village were invited.
By itself, the requirement to co-nance the input package should be expected to
lead nontrivial fractions of winners to choose not to take the voucher. In prac-

20

tice, 48.7% of voucher winners actually showed up and received their voucher.

Contrary to the study design that was agreed upon with the Manica provincial government, some control group respondents (voucher lottery losers) also
ended up receiving vouchers. This resulted from a mismatch in objectives between provincial government leadership and extension agents on the ground who

18 The

inverse hyperbolic sine transformation (IHST) of

is


1 
log x + x2 + 1 2 .

When

dependent variables are expressed in IHST, treatment eects can be interpreted as elasticities
(as with the log transformation), but unlike the log transformation it is dened at zero.
Burbidge et al. (1988) recommend the use of the IHST rather than the log transformation.

19 Voucher

take-up and voucher use variables are reported by study participants in the rst

survey (April 2011).

20 No

voucher winners were denied vouchers if they wanted them, so all voucher non-receipt

resulted from farmers choosing not to take the vouchers.

18

were actually distributing vouchers. Extension agents were each given a certain
number of vouchers to distribute in the months leading up to the December 2010
planting period (including areas separate from the study villages.) The fact that
take-up of the vouchers was less than 100% in the study villages meant that the
unused vouchers were expected (by the national government and donor agencies
funding the program) to be distributed to other farmers.

Our research team

emphasized that these unused vouchers should only be distributed outside the
study villages. We were not entirely successful in ensuring this, however, since it
was much less eort for extension agents to simply redistribute unused vouchers
in the study villages (extension agents did not need to incur time and other
costs of travel to other villages.) In the end, 12.9% of study participants in the
control group received vouchers.
It is clear, therefore, that our intervention should be considered an encouragement design. Random assignment led to higher voucher receipt in the
treatment group than in the control group. Table 2, column 1 displays results
from a regression of an indicator for voucher receipt on the treatment indica-

21

tor (and village xed eects).

The coecient on treatment is positive and

statistically signicant at the 1% level, indicating that the treatment led to an
increase of the rate of voucher receipt from 14% to 51%.
Voucher receipt did not guarantee actual use of the voucher. Some voucher
recipients chose not to bear the nancial cost of the input package co-payment,
and the transport cost to and from the input supplier. The impact of assignment to the treatment group on actual use of the voucher is therefore lower,
in percentage points, than the impact on voucher receipt. Table 2, column 2
presents results from a regression of an indicator of voucher use (actual purchase
of the subsidized input package) on the treatment indicator. The coecient on
treatment is positive and statistically signicantly dierent from zero at the
1% level, indicating a 29 percentage point increase in voucher use (more than
tripling the control group rate of 12%.)
Non-compliance with treatment assignment reduces our statistical power
to detect treatment eects on subsequent outcomes, but otherwise should not
threaten the internal validity of the results.

While we would have hoped to

have seen greater compliance, our setting may be relatively representative of the
actual implementation of voucher programs in many eld settings, particularly

21 The

dependent variable is equal to one if the household received at least one voucher. Out

of the 154 households who received at least one voucher, 146 received exactly one voucher,
and 8 received two vouchers.

when programs are implemented in collaboration with governments.

5.2 Treatment eect estimates
In this section, we trace the causal chain of voucher impacts, beginning with
impacts on input use, followed by agricultural production and sales, and indicators of household well-being.

We then assess the change in learning about

expected returns to better understand underlying mechanisms.

5.2.1 Input utilization
The vouchers provided a subsidy for use of fertilizer and improved seeds, so
we rst examine treatment eects on these outcomes.
mates of treatment eects (β from equation 6).

Table 3 presents esti-

Panel A presents regressions

where dependent variables are expressed in inverse hyperbolic sine transformation (IHST), while in Panel B dependent variables are in levels (truncated at
the 99th percentile.) In each panel, we present treatment eects separately in
three post-treatment seasons: 2011 (the season for which vouchers were provided), as well as 2012 and 2013 (for which no vouchers were provided).

We

also show treatment eects on the average of the 2012 and 2013 dependent variables, which improves power by averaging out noise (McKenzie (2012).) This
table format will be followed in the next two results tables as well.
The treatment had a clear positive impact on fertilizer use in the season
2010-11, for which the vouchers were provided.

In both the IHST and levels

specications, the treatment had a positive and statistically signicant impact
on fertilizer use on maize in kilograms, fertilizer use on maize in kg per hectare,
and total fertilizer used on all crops (in kg and in Mozambican meticals or
MZN). There is no large or statistically signicant impact on fertilizer use on
crops other than maize in that year. There is also a positive impact on use of
improved seeds (in kg, and in kg per hectare), which is statistically signicant
in the IHST specication.
The magnitude of the treatment eect on fertilizer use is consistent with
voucher take-up rates and the size of the input package. The treatment led to
a 29 percentage point increase in voucher use (Table 2, col. 2), and the input
package included 100 kg of fertilizer. If farmers taking up the package used the
entire package and did not substitute for fertilizer they would have used anyway,
the treatment eect on take-up would imply a treatment eect on fertilizer use
amounting to 29 kg. This is very similar to the estimated treatment eect in

20

Table 3, Panel B, column 4: 22.7 kg (signicant at the 5% level). This result
raises no substantial concerns that the subsidy voucher crowded out private
demand for fertilizer on the part of study participants, which has been found in
other contexts (Jayne et al. (2013).)
Impacts on fertilizer use persist in the subsequent 2012 and 2013 seasons.
The impact on average fertilizer use across 2012 and 2013 in total across all
crops (column 4) is statistically signicant at the 1% level in both the IHST
and levels specications, with a coecient magnitude (19.13 kg in the levels
regression) that is not much smaller than the impact in 2011 (22.72 kg). The
same patterns and signicance levels hold when the dependent variable is the
money value of total fertilizer used on all crops (column 5). The treatment eects
indicate fertilizer use on crops other than maize: impacts on fertilizer use on
both maize and non-maize crops (columns 1 and 3) are statistically signicant
in the IHST specications (and positive but only marginally signicant in the
levels regressions).

22

By contrast, impacts on improved seed use do not persist into 2012-13: treatment eects in those periods are small and are not statistically signicantly different from zero. One point of note is that in the season prior to the intervention,
22% of the households were using fertilizer for maize cultivation compared to
53% for improved seeds.

Given relatively high usage of improved seeds prior

to the intervention, it may be that improved seed utilization was already near
optimal levels, while fertilizer use was not.

5.2.2 Farm production and market sales
Given the treatment eects on fertilizer use, it is natural to next examine impacts on crop production and market sales. We do so in Table 4.
The treatment has positive impacts on maize production and yield (columns
1 and 2) in the subsidy year, 2011. Impacts on yield are statistically signicantly
dierent from zero at the 5% level in the IHST and levels specications. There
is no evidence of impacts in that year on production of other crops (column 3),

22 Treatment

eects on fertilizer use in the 2012 and 2013 seasons do not appear to be

simply due to respondents saving some fertilizer from their subsidized input packages (that
were intended to be used in 2011) for use in 2012 or 2013.

Respondents were surveyed in

2011 and, if they had redeemed the subsidy voucher for inputs, were asked What did your
household do with the fertilizer purchased with the voucher? Only 2.8% reported they had
not used the voucher yet. 88.7% said they had already used it for agricultural production.
The remainder said they had sold the voucher (1.4%), gave some other response (1.4%), or
did not respond to the question (5.6%).

21

the total value of crop production (column 4), or on sales of maize or all crops
combined (columns 5 and 6).
Positive treatment eects on maize yield persist into the 2012-13 postsubsidy seasons, and are accompanied by positive impacts on production of
other crops and on total production.

Regressions for the average of 2012-13

outcomes reveal positive treatment eects on other crop production and total
crop production that are signicant at conventional levels in both the IHST
and levels specications. The positive eect on other crop production is likely
related to the increase in fertilizer use on other crops that occurs post-subsidy.
The economic magnitude of the eect on total crop production is substantial. On average across 2012-13, the treatment leads to MZN 3,906 higher crop
production (signicant at the 5% level), a 21.6% increase over the level in the
control group. This is consistent with the 0.16 eect in the IHST specication
and exceeds the market value of the package.
One of the objectives of the Mozambican subsidy program was the transformation of subsistence farmers into commercial farmers who sell their output
in markets. The last two columns of Table 4 therefore examine treatment effects on market sales of maize and of all crops combined.

There is no large

or statistically signicant eect in the subsidy year, but positive eects emerge
subsequently.

On average across the 2012-13 seasons, the treatment leads to

higher market sales of both maize and all crops. These eects are statistically
signicant at the 5% level in the IHST specication for both outcomes.

5.2.3 Consumption, savings, assets, and housing quality
We now turn to treatment eects on consumption, savings, assets, and housing.
Regression results are in Table 5.
There are no impacts on any of these outcomes in the subsidy year, 2011.
Point estimates are typically small in magnitude, and none are statistically
signicantly dierent from zero at conventional levels.
Positive impacts emerge in the following two post-subsidy years. Again, we
focus the discussion on impacts on the average of the 2012 and 2013 outcome
variables. The treatment eect on per capita daily consumption in the household
(column 1) is positive and statistically signicant at the 5% level in both the

23

IHST and levels specications.

23 In

The impact amounts to MZN 10.59 per day,

results not shown, we nd no large or statistically signicant impact of the treatments

on the number of household members, in total as well as in various age subcategories.

22

14.7% increase over the mean in the control group.

One might take this as

perhaps the best overall summary result indicating that the treatment led to an
improvement in household well-being.
The remaining columns of the table examine impacts on various types of
assets. There are positive eects on all types of assets in columns 2-5, which
are substantial in magnitude and statistically signicantly dierent from zero in
IHST specications in the case of total savings, livestock, food stocks, and total
savings and assets (column 6). Results in levels specications are also positive
and large in magnitude, but are less precise, so only the results for total savings
and food stocks are statistically signicant (both of these at the 1% level).
Table 6 presents impacts of the treatment on housing improvements (which
were not included in total assets and savings in Table 5). The rst dependent
variable is a dummy that is equal to one if the respondent reported undertaking
any housing improvement (across the specic types in the table). There is no
impact in the rst year, but on average over the subsequent two years there
is a 4 percentage point increase in the likelihood of making any housing improvement that is statistically signicant at the 5% level, providing additional
evidence of long term improvement in the living conditions of the beneciaries.
The remaining columns of the table reveal that the specic areas of housing
improvement are in walls and oors. The fact that most improvements occur in
the year 2013 is consistent with the need for a period of savings before making
this lump sum investment.

5.3 Learning eects
Our theoretical model makes clear that a temporary subsidy could have persistent eects on technology adoption either via a wealth channel, or via learning
about the returns to the technology. To shed light on whether a learning channel
is operative, we asked farmers in all three survey rounds the following questions
about perceived returns to fertilizer: In the rst eld where your household
planted maize this year, if you use improved seed and fertilizer, what is the total production that is expected in: a) an average year, b) a very good year, and
c) a very bad year?. Respondents were told to assume the use of 100 kg of urea,
100 kg of NPK fertilizer, and 25 kg of improved seeds per hectare. Respondents
also gave estimates assuming that no improved inputs had been used, and were
asked to indicate how many years out of ten they expected to be average, very
good and very bad years.

These probability elicitations allow us to calculate

23

farmers' unconditional expected returns to improved seeds and fertilizers.
Table 7 presents estimated impacts of the treatment on expected returns
without the input package (column 1), with the input package (column 2) and
the dierence between the two (column 3). The latter can be interpreted as the
expected returns to the input package. The coecient on treatment is positive in
each regression, and is statistically signicantly dierent from zero in the IHST
specications for expected yield with fertilizer and for the returns to the input
package, in 2011, 2012, and on average over the 2012-13 seasons. Interestingly,
treatment eects on all outcomes in the 2013 season are consistently smaller in
magnitude and none are statistically signicantly dierent from zero. This may
reect knowledge spillovers over time to the control group, so that dierences
vis-a-vis the treatment group are attenuated.
These ndings that the treatment raised perceived returns to the input package are consistent with the existence of a learning channel, as outlined in the
theoretical section.

5.4 Spillovers in the social network
Our theoretical model allows the subsidy to aect technology adoption via learning about the returns to the new technology, not only from one's own experience
but also from the experience of others in one's social network. Examination of
social network eects is also of interest because experimentation by others in
one's social network would be expected to only inuence farmer learning and
not his or her liquidity.

Eects stemming from experimentation in the social

network are therefore more likely to be due to learning than wealth eects.
Our study design involved randomizing treatment assignment within villages, so fertilizer adoption of study participants could be aected not only by
their own treatment status, but also by the extent of treatment (voucher winning) in their social networks. To analyze eects of treatment within the social
network, we estimate the causal eect of the number of social network members
winning vouchers in the lottery. This analysis relies on two features of our study.
First, we have data on social network links prior to treatment, which we
collected ourselves in a manner analogous to Conley and Udry's (2010) elicitation of information links.

Study participants were presented with the full

list of other study participants in the same village, and asked which of these
they talked to about agriculture in the season prior to the study (2009-2010),
and if so whether they did so a bit, moderately, or a lot. For each study

24

participant, others whom they indicated as having talked to about agriculture

24

moderately or a lot are considered part of the participant's social network.

Note that, because we are interested in understanding spillovers of our randomized treatment within the social network, this elicitation only captures social
network links among study participants in the village, not the full set of social
network links (which would include study non-participants). Each respondent
was asked about their links with 11.5 other study partipants on average. Crucially for this analysis, respondents report quite substantial variation in social
network links with other study participants (in other words, study participants
do not have identical social networks).

The distribution of number of social

network links is given in Table 8A. The median number of social network links
is two. 30.0% of respondents said they had no social network links with other
study participants.

16.1% said they had one link, 12.6% had two, 7.4% had

25

three, 8.6% had four, and 25.3% had ve or more.

Second, we take advantage of the fact that randomization of the input subsidy voucher also generates random variation in the number of voucher winners
within a respondent's social network.

Table 8B presents the distribution of

number of voucher winners in a respondent's social network. The median number of voucher winners in the social network is one. 44.0% of respondents have
zero voucher winners in their social network. 18.3% have one, 15.0% have two,
8.2% have three, 5.8% have four, and 8.8% have ve or more. Among the 360
individuals with at least one study participant in their social network, the ratio
of number of voucher winners in the social network to number of study participants in one's social network has a mean of 0.485, very close to the 0.5 ratio
that would be expected given the one-half probability of voucher winning.
We estimate impacts of voucher winning in the social network on fertilizer
use (Yiv ) for study participant

k
Siv
for

the respondent having one, two, three, four, or ve or more study participants
in his or her social network (for each of these sets of indicator variables, the
omitted category is zero).
The regression analysis conditions on the number of study participants in
one's social network, because this variable is not exogenously determined, and
is (mechanically) positively correlated with the number of voucher winners in
one's social network. When controlling for number of study participants in one's
social network, the regression coecients on the number of voucher winners in
one's social network can be interpreted as causal. Rather than imposing a particular functional form (e.g., a linear relationship), we specify voucher winners
and study participants in the social network via a set of indicator variables to
capture nonlinear eects. The coecients of interest in the regression are the

γk coecients

on the number of voucher winners in one's social network.

Regression results are in Table 9. For space considerations, we show only
the specications where dependent variables are expressed in inverse hyperbolic

26

sine transformation (IHST).

In Panel A the dependent variable is the IHST

of fertilizer use on maize, while in Panel B it is the IHST of fertilizer use on
all crops. Coecients for each of the three seasons (2011, 2012, and 2013) are
presented in columns 1-3, and in column 4 we show results for the average of the
post-voucher-season (2012 and 2013) outcomes. For each regression we report
the
the

γk
γk

coecients as well as the p-value of the F-test of the joint signicance of
coecients in that regression.

In the season for which the voucher was oered, 2011, social network eects
in both panels are typically negative in sign, but tests of joint signicance do

27

not reject the null of zero eect at conventional signicance levels.

In 2012,

there are positive social network eects on fertilizer use on maize (jointly signicant at the 10% level), and in 2013 there are positive social network eects
on fertilizer use on all crops (jointly signicant at the 1% level).

On average

over the 2012-2013 seasons, social network eects are positive and jointly statistically signicant at the 5% level for fertilizer use on all crops, and marginally
statistically signicant (with p-value 0.11) for fertilizer use on maize. That these

26 Regressions

for dependent variables expressed in levels yield very similar conclusions,

although they are often less precise.

27 A

possible explanation for these negative coecients could be that individuals with social

network members who received vouchers adopt a wait and see approach to fertilizer, holding
o on their own investments until they can observe the returns experienced by others.

26

impacts of social network voucher receipt occur only in years subsequent to the
voucher distribution season is consistent with learning about fertilizer impacts
in one's social network. It also seems sensible that statistically signicant social
network eects occur rst (2012) for fertilizer use on maize (which the input
package was designed for) and only later (2013) for fertilizer use on all crops.
The impacts on fertilizer use of voucher winning in one's social network
are large in magnitude. For example, in the regression for fertilizer use on all
crops on average over the 2012-13 seasons (Panel B, column 4), the impact of
having one voucher winner in one's social network is nearly equal in magnitude
to the impact of winning a voucher oneself (both coecients are about 0.5).
The coecient estimates on having two or more voucher winners in one's social
network are even larger, ranging in magnitude from 0.86 to 1.37. The fact that
voucher winning in one's social network has eects equal to or larger than eects
of winning oneself is also consistent with learning being the primary channel of
the voucher impacts, as opposed to the wealth channel.
Another broad pattern of note is that the eects of voucher winning in
the social network appear to be nonlinear. There is typically a positive eect
of having one voucher winner in the social network, and a somewhat larger
eect of having two, but the eect appears to atten thereafter, with not much
additional impact of having three, four, or ve or more winners in the social
network (relative to having two).

Conclusion

We report the results of a randomized experiment testing impacts of a subsidy
for modern agricultural inputs (fertilizer and improved seeds) on input utilization, agricultural output, and other household outcomes. We nd substantial
and persistent impacts (spanning three years following the one-time subsidy) on
all these outcomes.
Our results are consistent with a set of theoretical models that predict persistence of one-time subsidies, and inconsistent with others that do not have
such a persistence feature. In particular, our ndings are consistent with models in which individuals must learn the returns to new technologies, via own
experience or the experience of others in their social network.

Winning the

voucher lottery raises individual reports of expected returns to fertilizer. In addition, individual fertilizer use is strongly inuenced by the number of voucher

27

winners in one's social network.

Both these patterns are consistent with the

learning channel. Given the expense of permanent fertilizer subsidies in many
sub-Saharan African countries that have adopted them, the results here motivate a more careful examination of whether the goals of permanent subsidies
can be met with temporary subsidies that overcome barriers to experimentation
and learning.

Note: Robust standard errors in brackets. Vouchers distributed at start of 2011 agricultural season. No vouchers were distributed for the 2012
and 2013 seasons. Dependent variables for "Average, 2012-2013 seasons" rows are the average of the dependent variables for the 2012 and
2013 seasons (if either one is missing, the value for the non-missing year is used.) Treatment is randomized within each of 41 villages. Each
regression includes village fixed effects. MZN = Mozambican meticals (approx. 27 MZN/USD).

m0 (y)φy (y)dy = 0

ˆ
[Φỹ (y)) − Φy (ỹ)] ≥ 0 ∀ y ≤ y + ,

where Φi denotes the cumulative distribution function corresponding to
random variable i. More generally, φỹ (ỹ|B0 ) = φy (y + B0 ) + m0 (y + B0 ).
For the special case in which priors are not diuse, but are potentially
biased, we can write φỹ (ỹ) = φy (y + B0 ).
•

Distribution of Returns : Second, we assume that learning reduces the
diuseness of prior beliefs. In particular, we assume that based on observation of own and neighbors' period 1 returns to fertilizers, updated
period 1 beliefs are no more diuse than period 1 beliefs. Specically,
holding the bias in expected returns constant, period 0 beliefs can always
be expressed as a mean preserving spread of period 1 beliefs.

While there are various ways to model learning, we here assume that learning
is naive or unanticipated. Under this assumption, rst period choice is exactly
as modeled above. However, unanticipated learning will make second period or
sustained adoption more likely under our assumption that experience operates
as a mean preserving squeeze, making φ1 (y) less diuse than the prior φ0 (y).
As shown above, this shift in subjective beliefs will lower z̃2 , making expanding
the set of individuals who will sustain adoption of the new technology.

Note: Robust standard errors in brackets. Dependent variable is an indicator equal to 1 if
respondent attrited from given follow-up survey (i.e., attrition is always with respect to
initial study participant list). Treatment is randomized within each of 41 villages. Each
regression includes village fixed effects.
