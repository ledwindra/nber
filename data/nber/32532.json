    "abstract": "\n\nIn a collaborative project with ten central banks, we have investigated the causes of the post-pandemic global inflation, building on our earlier work for the United States. Globally, as in the United States, pandemic-era inflation was due primarily to supply disruptions and sharp increases in the prices of food and energy; however, and in sharp contrast to the 1970s, the inflationary effects of these supply shocks have not been persistent, in part due to the credibility of central bank inflation targets. As the effects of supply shocks have subsided, tight labor markets, and the rises in nominal wages, have become relatively more important sources of inflation in many countries. In several countries, including the United States, curbing wage inflation and returning price inflation to target may require a period of modestly higher unemployment.\n\n",
