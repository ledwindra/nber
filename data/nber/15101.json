    "abstract": "\n\nObesity is associated with serious health problems, and it can generate adverse economic outcomes.  We analyze a nationally-representative sample of young American adults to investigate the interplay between obesity, wages and self-esteem.  Wages can be impacted directly by obesity, and they can be influenced by obesity indirectly through the channel of obesity to self-esteem to wages.  We find that female wages are directly influenced by body weight, and self-esteem has an impact on wages in case of whites. Being overweight or obese has a negative impact on the self-esteem of females and of black males.  The results suggest that obesity has the most significant impact on white women's wages.\n\n",
