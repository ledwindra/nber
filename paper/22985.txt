Cross-Sectional Patterns of Mortgage Debt during the Housing Boom: Evidence and Implications

ABSTRACT
The reallocation of mortgage debt to low-income or marginally qualified borrowers plays a
central role in many explanations of the early 2000s housing boom. We show that such a
reallocation never occurred, as the distribution of mortgage debt with respect to income changed
little even as the aggregate stock of debt grew rapidly. Moreover, because mortgage debt varies
positively with income in the cross section, equal percentage increases in debt among high- and
low-income borrowers meant that wealthy borrowers accounted for most new debt in dollar
terms. Previous research stressing the importance of low-income borrowing was based on the
inflow of new mortgage originations alone, so it could not detect offsetting outflows in mortgage
terminations that left the allocation of debt stable over time. And while defaults on subprime
mortgages played an important part in the financial crisis, the data show that subprime lending did
not cause a reallocation of debt toward the poor. Rather, subprime lending prevented a
reallocation of debt toward the wealthy.

Introduction

The early 2000s saw a large expansion of mortgage debt in the United States. The Federal
Reserve’s Flow of Funds accounts show that the aggregate stock of mortgage debt on the
liability side of household balance sheets doubled from $5.3 trillion in 2001 to $10.6 trillion
in 2007. During this period, mortgage debt grew much faster than income did, so there
was a substantial increase in the debt-to-income ratio, as seen in the top panel of Figure
1. In this paper, we study this mortgage boom with particular attention to how this debt
was allocated with respect to income. Our findings contradict conventional theories that the
mortgage boom was driven by disproportionate borrowing at the lower end of the income
distribution.1
The most important finding of the paper is that there was no reallocation of mortgage
debt toward low-income individuals during the mortgage boom. To be sure, low-income borrowing grew rapidly, with much of this new debt packaged into the subprime mortgage-backed
securities that caused so many problems during the 2008 financial crisis. Yet borrowing by
high-income individuals rose at similar rates, so the distribution of debt with respect to
income remained stable over time. This stability emerges clearly in a number of datasets,
including the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), a periodic and comprehensive study of U.S. household balance sheets. The top left panel of Figure 2 depicts
the shares of total outstanding mortgage debt held by households in various quantiles of
wage income in the 2001 and 2007 waves of the SCF. No quantile significantly increases its
share of debt in the early 2000s as aggregate debt rises. The middle left panel of Figure 2
focuses on the debt-income relationship more closely, by presenting a binned scatter plot of
log mortgage debt against log wage income in 2001 and 2007. There is an approximately
log-linear relationship between income and debt that shifts upward nearly equally across
the income distribution, indicating that debt rose by similar percentages for low-income and
high-income households alike. The top right and middle right panels in Figure 2 show similar
results from a separate dataset that combines zip code-level mortgage debt data from the
Equifax credit bureau with similarly aggregated income data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Equifax/IRS dataset is much larger than the SCF; there are around 40,000
zip codes in the country, while the SCF covers only about 3,000–6,000 households every
three years. Despite these diﬀerences, the zip code-level dataset confirms the SCF’s bottom
line: the debt distribution changed little during the mortgage boom because the debt-income
1

Amromin and McGranahan (2015) write that a “voluminous” literature on early 2000s credit markets,
including mortgage markets, has noted that this period “was characterized by the liberalization of credit
access to households that had previously found it diﬃcult to qualify because of poor credit records, insuﬃcient
income, or both. The liberalization of credit access has largely been ascribed to financial innovation through
securitization markets that allowed loan originators to oﬄoad credit risk to a broad set of private investors”
(p. 147).

relationship shifted up nearly equally across the income distribution.2 Mathematically, the
combination of a stable debt distribution and a positive cross-sectional relationship between
debt and income implies that, in dollar terms, most new mortgage debt went to the wealthy.
This fact is illustrated in the bottom two panels of Figure 2. The Equifax/IRS panel at
right shows that borrowers in the highest-income zip codes accounted for about $1.5 trillion
in new debt from 2001 to 2006, while mortgage debt for the lowest-income quintile rose by
only $320 billion.3
The stability of the debt distribution may seem surprising, because many commentators
have assumed that the early 2000s featured a significant credit expansion along the extensive
margin, with large numbers of marginal or low-income individuals able to qualify for mortgages and become homeowners for the first time. A look back at Figure 1, however, shows
why the extensive-margin hypothesis has problems explaining the behavior of mortgage debt
in the early 2000s. The lower panel of this figure depicts the U.S. homeownership rate, and
a comparison of that panel with the debt-to-income ratio above it shows that the mortgage
boom followed an increase in homeownership that originated in the mid-1990s.4 But the
lower panel also shows that the homeownership rate ended the 2001–2007 mortgage boom
about where it began. To study the extensive margin of debt more closely, we use the SCF
and Equifax/IRS datasets as well as individual-level credit records in the Equifax data, which
lack income information but include a type of credit score. Overall, there is no evidence of a
relative expansion of mortgage borrowing among low-income or marginal borrowers during
the boom, particularly after conditioning on age. In fact, income becomes a more-important,
not less-important, correlate of homeownership after the mortgage boom begins, especially
for young households. And, consistent with Bhutta (2015), the individual-level Equifax
credit records show that transitions into first-time mortgage borrowing became less frequent
for persons with low credit scores during the mortgage boom, as part of a general decline in
first-time home buying. Of course, many lenders relaxed their credit standards during the
boom. But the data suggest that the eﬀect of this relaxation on the extensive margin of
2

In the main text, we explain how the zip code-level dataset was constructed and why a peculiarity of
IRS income-data collection in 2007 causes us to date the mortgage boom as ending in 2006 rather than 2007
when using the Equifax/IRS dataset. As discussed in the internet appendix, all of the zip code-level results
remain robust to using 2007 as the last year of the mortgage boom instead. We will also show that the slight
tilt of mortgage debt toward richer borrowers in the scatter plot that uses the Equifax/IRS data arises from
shifts in debt between city-level housing markets, not within these markets.
3
In the internet appendix, we replicate the bar charts in Figure 2 that use SCF data with 20 rather
than five income categories. The same lessons hold at the higher level of disaggregation, as debt shares
are generally stable so that the rich take out the most debt in dollar terms. The appendix also relates our
findings to those of Kumhof, Rancière, and Winant (2015), who study total debt (as opposed to mortgage
debt) for the top 5 percent and bottom 95 percent of SCF households from 1983 onward.

See the internet appendix for an alternative measure of homeownership: the total number of owneroccupied housing units divided by the total number of adults. Movements in this alternative measure are
similar to movements in the standard homeownership measure.

debt was oﬀset by the rapid increase in house prices, which made first-time buying diﬃcult.
Throughout this paper we highlight the distinction between the stocks of debt on household balance sheets and the two gross flows of debt, originations and terminations. This
distinction is sometimes unclear in existing research. For example, Mian and Sufi (2009) use
data generated by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) to argue that the allocation
of mortgage credit changed fundamentally during the mortgage boom, in ways that channelled credit disproportionately to marginal or low-income borrowers. HMDA is a nearly
comprehensive source of data on mortgage applications and originations, and for many topics related to the allocation of credit, such as the possibility of racial discrimination, a sole
focus on originations is appropriate.5 But many times, the origination of a new mortgage
(for example, the mortgage of a home buyer) is oﬀset by the termination of another mortgage
(for example, the mortgage of a seller). Because HMDA does not cover terminations, HMDA
data alone cannot be used to study the distribution of mortgage debt.
The stability of the cross-sectional distribution of debt supports an emerging “new narrative” on the housing cycle, which disputes the common claim that the cycle was driven
primarily by an exogenous relaxation of credit constraints. In theory, relaxed constraints
might raise eﬀective demand and prices among low-priced homes, which could in turn spill
over to higher-price segments of the market (Landvoigt, Piazzesi, and Schneider 2015). But
it is hard to see how anything that raised mortgage debt among low-income borrowers by
$320 billion could have generated spillovers large enough to encourage $1.5 trillion in new
borrowing by the wealthy. By providing precise measures of debt stocks as well as flows,
we build on Adelino, Schoar, and Severino (2016), the first paper to directly challenge the
findings in Mian and Sufi (2009) regarding the allocation of debt. Adelino, Schoar, and Severino (2016) use HMDA data to show that the Mian-Sufi findings were driven by relatively
high growth in the number of purchase mortgages originated in low-income zip codes, not
by higher dollar values of mortgages. To the authors, this finding indicated that the original
Mian-Sufi findings reflected only higher transaction volumes in low-income areas, not a reallocation of mortgage debt toward low-income borrowers. Yet without zip code-level data
on mortgage terminations, stocks of mortgage debt, or numbers of mortgage borrowers, it is
impossible to rule out the hypothesis that the higher transaction volumes in low-income zip
codes resulted in more low-income homeowners—an extensive-margin expansion of credit
that is consistent with the conventional theory. An analysis of both stocks and flows at
diﬀerent levels of geographic detail settles this question by ruling out an expansion of mortgage credit along the extensive margin. A disaggregated analysis of debt stocks also shows
that even though subprime lending was disproportionately concentrated in low-income areas,
5

The Boston Fed’s study of racial discrimination (Munnell et al. 1996) was based on HMDA data supplemented with additional information from lenders.

3

the overall amount of subprime debt remained relatively small, despite a rapid ramp-up of
subprime originations during the last half of the boom.6
In the conclusion, we discuss how these empirical results might inform theoretical models.
As pointed out by Foote, Gerardi, and Willen (2012), Glaeser, Gottlieb, and Gyourko (2013),
and others, several empirical facts point to higher house-price expectations as a key driver of
the housing cycle. The stability of cross-sectional distribution of mortgage debt with respect
to income is consistent with the expectations theory as well. While capturing “bubble
psychology” in a formal model is diﬃcult, many models are now shedding light on the
possible origins of such psychology, as well as the eﬀect that bubbles could have on both the
housing market and the wider economy.

Cross-Sectional Data on Debt Stocks and Income

2.1

Debt and Income Data from Equifax and the IRS

The zip code-level measures of mortgage debt used in this paper come from the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York’s Consumer Credit Panel, a quarterly, longitudinal 5 percent
sample of individual credit histories supplied by the Equifax credit bureau. The dataset
begins in 1999, and because individual-level credit histories are included in the sample based
on the last two digits of the individual’s social security number, the dataset can be updated to
incorporate new entrants over time.7 Among other debt variables, the Equifax data contain
detailed information on mortgage debt. Included are the amounts and dates associated with
the origination of new loans, as well as outstanding balances for first mortgages, subordinate
mortgages, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). We can also measure the number and
value of mortgage terminations. A termination is defined as occurring in the last quarter
that a mortgage appears in the data, and the value of that termination is defined as the
remaining balance when the loan is removed.
A unique characteristic of credit-bureau data is its ability to paint a comprehensive
picture of both stocks and flows of mortgage debt. The net change in the stock of mortgage
debt is simply gross inflows less gross outflows:
6

In addition to Adelino, Schoar, and Severino (2016) and Bhutta (2015), other papers in the new-narrative
literature include Albanesi, DeGiorgi, and Nosal (2016), which examines debt and credit scores, rather than
debt and income, and Ferreira and Gyourko (2015). The latter paper shows that most foreclosures took
place among prime borrowers, not subprime borrowers, with the implication that the foreclosure crisis “was
largely one of sound borrowers falling into negative equity because of very large declines in house prices” (p.
21).
7
As discussed above, we aggregate the Equifax records by zip code in order to match them with available
income data from the IRS. When we do so, we multiply the aggregated debt data by 20, because the data
come from a 5 percent sample of individuals.

Other common data sources are exclusively focused on inflows, and specifically on originations. The HMDA data used in previous research follow a law passed in 1975 that requires
certain financial institutions to report individual-level data relating to mortgage applications
and originations, including the dollar amount of each new mortgage and the census tract
of the house backing the loan. As far as originations go, HMDA is quite comprehensive,
but, as noted earlier, HMDA data cannot be used to measure mortgage terminations or debt
stocks.8 Data from public registries of deeds suﬀer from a similar limitation, in that they
provide good coverage of originations but problematic coverage of terminations.9
In addition to information on mortgage debt, the Equifax dataset contains a small number
of borrower-level characteristics, such as age and an end-of-quarter credit score called the
Equifax Risk Score. This score, created by Equifax, resembles a FICO score, in that a higher
value indicates a lower probability of default over the near term. We have found the mode
of the credit-score distribution moves to the right somewhat over time, but this movement is
8

HMDA’s coverage of originations is very good but still incomplete. Only mortgage companies and
depository institutions with oﬃces in metropolitan areas are required to report, and the reporting of home
equity lines of credit (HELOCs) is optional. There is also limited information about the individuals applying
for mortgages (only race, income, and gender), and, as we note below, some researchers have questioned the
accuracy of the borrower-level income data reported on HMDA forms (Mian and Sufi 2016a).
9
The dataset in Ferreira and Gyourko (2015) is based on public-records data supplied by the DataQuick
company. The lack of precise information on mortgage terminations in that dataset makes it hard for the
authors to know whether a new, non-purchase mortgage represents the refinance of an existing loan or a new
mortgage that adds to the homeowner’s existing stock of debt. The authors assume that a new non-purchase
mortgage is a refinance if its value is more than half of either the imputed current price of the home or of
the total mortgage balance taken out when the home was purchased.

not very worrisome because it does not become severe until 2010, after the mortgage boom
ends. Also, we only use the Equifax score to distinguish the creditworthiness of individuals
within a given year, not to measure changes in individual-level creditworthiness over time.
Loan-level datasets generated by mortgage securitizers or mortgage servicers also provide
information on originations and terminations, but neither type of dataset is comprehensive.
The CoreLogic Private Label Securities ABS Database provides loan-level data only for
mortgages that have been packaged into non-agency securities (that is, securities that are
not backed by any of the government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae, Freddie
Mac, and Ginnie Mae). For this specific group of mortgages, which includes the large
majority of subprime loans, the coverage of the CoreLogic dataset is excellent, as it contains
an expansive set of variables for loans in almost all non-agency securities issued since 1992.
Yet the CoreLogic dataset cannot measure aggregate debt stocks, because (as discussed
below) subprime and other types of non-agency loans made up a small share of the mortgage
market throughout the early 2000s.10 CoreLogic data can be used to measure cross-sectional
patterns in the use of securitized subprime and Alt-A debt, however, and we do so below.11
The loan-level dataset from McDash Analytics has broader coverage, because it is based
on data supplied by mortgage servicers (typically banks) and therefore includes agency and
portfolio loans as well as non-agency loans. Unfortunately, the collection of servicers in
McDash is not considered representative of the entire mortgage market until at least 2005.
A disadvantage of the Equifax dataset is that it contains no information on income. We
therefore follow previous research and construct aggregates of debt at the zip-code level,
and then merge the debt aggregates with zip code-level data on income from the IRS. Zip
code-level information is available on a host of income variables, including adjusted gross
income (AGI) and salary and wage income, for the years 1998, 2001, 2002, and 2004–2012.12
In addition to the income variables, we also use the number of returns and the number
of exemptions in the IRS dataset to measure zip code-level households and population,
respectively.
The IRS income data are comprehensive, because they are based on the universe of
tax returns, but they are still imperfect. For one thing, the IRS uses suppression rules
to ensure that no individual information can be backed out of the published zip code-level
data, and these suppression rules change from year to year. An additional source of potential
measurement error arises from yearly changes in the share of earners who file tax returns.
10

The CoreLogic database was originally called the LoanPerformance database after the company that
developed it.
11
Alt-A loans were loans to prime borrowers that did not qualify for standard prime pools, typically
because of reduced documentation. The name is derived from the fact that lenders referred to prime borrowers
as “A” borrowers, as opposed to the “B” and “C” borrowers who were considered subprime.
12
The IRS income data come from the Statistics of Income Program. See http://www.irs.gov/uac/
SOI-Tax-Stats-Individual-Income-Tax-Statistics-zip-Code-Data-%28SOI%29 for details.

The number of filers rose sharply in 2007, as people were encouraged to file returns in order
to receive economic-stimulus payments, as seen in Figure 3. In the internet appendix, we
show that the additional filers have little eﬀect on income aggregates, implying that these
filers reported low (or zero) incomes. However, by distorting our measure of the number of
households in each zip code, the 2007 spike in returns could potentially distort some results if
the mortgage boom is defined as ending in 2007. Consequently, when using the zip code-level
data, we choose 2006 as the ending year of the boom instead. Fortunately, robustness checks
presented in the internet appendix indicate that the distortion induced by the extra filers in
2007 is not severe, as our zip code-level results hold even with 2007 chosen as the boom’s last
year. Another measurement issue related to the IRS data is what type of income to use. In
the empirical work below, income is defined as salary and wage income, which is likely to be
the most important type of income considered by lenders when underwriting mortgage loans.
A type of income that lenders are not likely to consider is capital gains, which is included in
AGI. Here again, measurement issues are not a great concern. The internet appendix shows
that our main results are robust to defining income either as salary and wages or as AGI.
Table 1 presents summary statistics for the zip code-level Equifax/IRS dataset. The
values are medians within each IRS return-weighted income quintile at the beginning and
end of the mortgage boom: 2001 and 2006. The quintiles are constructed to have similar
numbers of tax returns, so the negative correlation between zip code-level population and
income means that low-income quintiles tend to include more zip codes than high-income
quintiles. As expected, median mortgage-debt levels and house values are positively correlated with income, as are credit scores. Because credit scores are well known to rise with
age, one potential explanation for the latter correlation is that richer zip codes tend to include older residents. Yet the table also shows that median age varies little across income
quintiles. Two other facts relate directly to changes in the cross-sectional distribution of
debt. First, the amount of total mortgage debt grew significantly for all income groups;
from $51,000 to $73,000 per return in the lowest-income quintile of zip codes, and from
$130,000 to $215,000 in the highest-income quintile. Second, the proportion of mortgaged
households grew only modestly across the income distribution; from 27 to 32 percent for
the poorest zip codes and from 51 to 58 percent for the richest. Ideally, the Equifax data
would tell us whether individuals owned homes, but we only know whether individuals hold
mortgage debt. Homeownership information is available in the SCF, to which we turn next.

2.2

Household-Level Data from the Survey of Consumer Finances

The large Equifax/IRS dataset allows a detailed look at cross-sectional debt patterns both
within and across housing markets, but its limited demographic and housing-tenure infor-

7

mation, as well as its zip code-level nature, suggests the need for additional data.13 We
generate a number of results using individual-level data from the SCF, a triennial survey of
households conducted by the Federal Reserve. Sample sizes in the SCF range from just over
3,000 households in 1989 to more than 6,000 by 2010, so the SCF is too small to use when
examining mortgage debt within housing markets. Yet what the SCF lacks in size it makes
up for in quality, as it provides a complete characterization of household-level balance sheets,
including data on various types of mortgage debt. As a result, the SCF is considered to be
the best source of individual-level data on housing-related debt and wealth in the United
States.14 The SCF includes separate information on debt secured by the household’s primary residence as well as data on any other real estate debt. We always combine these two
measures. Like the total debt measure in the Equifax data, the SCF debt measure encompasses first mortgages, subordinate mortgages, and HELOCs. As for income, information is
available on both total income (comparable to AGI) and wage and salary income. The SCF
also includes a host of demographic variables, including the age, marital status, and race
of the household head. We use the summary datasets that pull together key SCF variables
from 1989 through 2013, which are made available to the public by the Federal Reserve’s
Board of Governors.15 The internet appendix shows that both the SCF and Equifax measures of mortgage debt correlate well with the Flow of Funds measure of debt, and that our
aggregates of SCF and Equifax debt match aggregates constructed from the same datasets
by other researchers.
Summary statistics for SCF data in 2001 and 2007 appear in Table 2.16 The table
13

Because the Equifax/IRS dataset is defined at the zip-code level, its results could be influenced by the
migration of households across zip-code boundaries.
14
In their study of wealth concentration, Saez and Zucman (2016) use a sample of anonymized individuallevel tax returns, the Tax Model Files, to back out wealth estimates based on income flows and itemized
deductions. Individual-level housing assets are inferred by capitalizing property tax payments in a way that is
consistent with national aggregates. Mortgage debt is netted out of housing wealth by capitalizing mortgageinterest deductions in a similar way. While the Tax Model Files are a good source of housing wealth and
debt for tax filers at the top of the income distribution—the focus of the Saez-Zucman study—the authors
note that the tax-capitalization method is probably less accurate for less-wealthy filers, in part because these
filers itemize their deductions less often. “The SCF is essential for accurately measuring housing and pension
wealth, the main forms of wealth for the bottom 90 percent, and indeed our own estimates for housing and
pension wealth rely on it,” the authors write. “The value added of our estimates [based on the Tax Model
Files] relative to the SCF is that they cover a longer period, are annual, and are more suited to capture the
very top, if only because they include the 400 richest Americans” (p. 569, insertion added). See the internet
appendix for more discussion of the Tax Model Files as a potential data source.
15
Variables included in the summary datasets are those used in the regular analyses of SCF data published
in the Federal Reserve Bulletin. See Bricker et al. (2014) for the most recent Bulletin article, and http:
//www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/scfindex.htm to download either the raw SCF data or the
summary data files.
16
The SCF contains five copies, or “implicates,” of the data for each household, with missing or confidential
data imputed diﬀerently across each implicate. Users of the SCF are instructed to perform statistical tests
on each implicate separately, using sample weights, and then combine the resulting parameter estimates and
variance-covariance matricies using the Repeated-Imputation Inference (RII) of Rubin (1987). The summary

8

makes it clear that the mortgage debt variable in the SCF is a comprehensive measure,
including debt on properties other than the primary residence as well as HELOCs. The
top panel uses data from all households and defines income as total income. The lower
panel defines income as salary and wages and excludes households with zero values of that
variable. As noted in the introduction, similar growth rates of mortgage debt across the
income distribution generate much larger dollar increases in debt for high-income quintiles.
For example, Panel A indicates that the average household in the lowest-income quintile
of total income saw its mortgage debt increase from $5,294 in 2001 to $10,795 in 2007.
The comparable increase for a household in the highest-income group was from $122,314 to
$219,228. The table also includes information on both the share of mortgaged households
in each quintile and homeownership rates. Both of these statistics are stable or rise only
modestly across all income groups.17 Finally, the last two columns present information on
the asset side of household balance sheets, specifically (self-reported) housing values, which
rose rapidly during the boom.

3.1

Income and the Distribution of Mortgage Debt
Unconditional Distributions of Debt

Before we study the conditional relationship between mortgage debt and income, we first
examine unconditional distributions of debt at both the household and zip-code levels. The
top left panel of Figure 4 depicts household-level kernel distributions of the log of mortgage
debt in 1995, 2001, and 2007 from the SCF. Over time, this distribution moves to the
right as aggregate mortgage debt rises. The shape of the debt distribution also changes,
narrowing from 1995 to 2001. A narrowing of the unconditional debt distribution indicates
that low-debt households on the left side of the 1995 distribution experienced relatively
greater increases in debt through 2001. After that, however, the distribution appears to
flatten out, suggesting that from 2001 to 2007, households with high amounts of debt saw
greater debt growth. An analysis of distributional statistics, such as standard deviation
and interquartile range, confirms that the SCF debt distribution narrowed throughout the
1990s. These statistics remain relatively constant in the 2000s, however, implying that the
boom-era widening near the mode of the distribution was oﬀset by movements in dispersion
statistics in Table 2 are simple averages of the five within-implicate weighted averages.
17
The second column of figures in the table shows the number of unweighted SCF observations for each
quintile. When these observations are weighted, they generate equal numbers of households in each quintile.
The number of unweighted observations is largest for the richest quintile, to allow the SCF to accurately
characterize the long right tail of the wealth distribution (Kennickell 2007). The number of unweighted
observations is not an integer because each SCF household is represented by five implicates, and the income
fields often diﬀer slightly across implicates for a given household.

near the tails.18
The remaining panels of Figure 4 depict returns-weighted zip code-level kernel distributions of log mortgage debt per return from Equifax. These data are not available for 1995, so
the panels include distributions only at the start and end of the mortgage boom (2001 and
2006). Interestingly, in the early 2000s the movement in the aggregate debt distribution was
qualitatively similar to the movement in the SCF distribution over the corresponding period (note the diﬀerence in horizontal scales, however). More importantly, the zip code-level
distribution also appears to have widened, and here the behavior of the standard deviation
confirms this formally, as it rises from 0.41 in 2001 to 0.48 in 2006.
The bottom two panels exploit the rich geographic dimension of the Equifax/IRS dataset
to ask whether this widening stemmed from between-city or within-city movements in debt.
As noted in previous research, looking within individual housing markets holds constant
any factors that aﬀect the market as a whole. In this paper, housing markets are defined as
cities, more specifically as Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs).19 By construction, both of
the within-CBSA distributions depicted in the lower left panel are centered at zero, because
they are distributions of debt relative to CBSA means. The stable shape of the distributions
indicates that increased dispersion in total debt from 2001 to 2006 arose from the increase
in the dispersion between cities, as confirmed in the lower right panel.20
Taken together, the Equifax distributions indicate that mortgage debt levels for zip codes
in the same city moved together. Some cities boomed and experienced high debt growth,
while other cities experienced less growth. But within each local market, debt grew at similar
rates in high- and low-debt areas. This finding is inconsistent with the claim that the housing
boom reallocated debt to areas with previously low levels of debt, as this type of reallocation
would have narrowed the within-CBSA debt distributions over time.
A related claim is that the boom reallocated debt toward low-income communities. Yet
if these low-income communities were also low-debt communities, then the same critique
applies: there should have been a narrowing of the debt distribution in the early 2000s.
However, we must be careful about using the unconditional distributions in Figure 4 for
statements about the allocation of debt conditional on income. The unconditional distri18

See the internet appendix for details. Note that households with zero levels of mortgage debt are not
included in the SCF distribution of Figure 4, but these households are included in both the bar charts and
binned scatter plots of Figure 2 and the debt-income analysis in the next section.
19
The government defines CBSAs as groups of counties or county equivalents that are integrated around
an urban core with at least 10,000 residents. Those based on urban cores with between 10,000 and 50,000
people are called micropolitan statistical areas, and CBSAs based on larger urban cores are called metropolitan statistical areas. In 2003, the CBSA classification system replaced the government’s previous urban
classification system, which was based on metropolitan statistical areas alone.
20
Formally, the between variation in the Equifax debt density rises from 0.18 in 2001 to 0.24 in 2006.
The within-CBSA variation rises from 0.23 to 0.24. Note that within and between variation sum to total
variation in the two years (0.41 and 0.48).

butions will be aﬀected by changes in the debt-income relationship, but these distributions
are formally determined by the way that the debt-income relationship interacts with the
distribution of income across communities.21 The same point applies to the introductory bar
charts in Figure 2. The stability of those debt distributions does not rule out a shift in the
relationship between income and debt, because those distributions are also aﬀected by shifts
in the distribution of income. As a result, in order to learn about the debt-income relationship, we have to estimate this conditional relationship directly. We did so nonparametrically
with the binned scatter plots that also appeared in Figure 2. We do so parametrically by
regressing debt on income in the next subsection.

3.2

Debt and Income: Regression Estimates

We first specify a conditional expectation function for debt and income. A potential parametric form for this function is
E(dcit |ycit ) = αt + βt · ycit ,

(1)

which assigns a debt stock d to unit i in housing market c in year t as a function of income
y. Here, unit i could refer either to a zip code (in the Equifax/IRS data) or to a household
(in the SCF). For households, the relationship between mortgage debt and income is also
dependent on demographic factors including age, in part because older households have had
time to amortize a larger fraction of their mortgages. Therefore, when we analyze debt at the
household level we always condition on age, as well as other demographic factors discussed
below. The parameters of the function, α and β, have time subscripts to allow them to
change over time.
Although it is simple, the conditional expectation function easily formalizes various theories about the mortgage boom. The standard view is that credit flowed disproportionately to borrowers with low incomes. As seen in Figure 2, the cross-sectional relationship
between debt and income is positive (that is, richer borrowers have more debt), so a reallocation of debt toward low-income borrowers would reduce this correlation over time
(0 < β2006 < β2001 ). An alternative theory suggested by the changes in debt across years in
Figure 2 is that debt rose by equal percentage amounts across the income distribution. If
income were specified in natural logs, then we would expect the intercept αt to rise over time,
with no change in the cross-sectional relationship between debt and income (β2006 = β2001 ).
∫∞
To see this, note that f1 (d) = 0 f (d|y)g(y)dy, where f1 is the marginal (or unconditional) distribution
of debt d, f (d|y) is the distribution of debt conditional on income y, and g(y) is the distribution of income.
This equation makes it clear that changes in the distribution of income g(y) also matter for the marginal
distributions f1 (d). The potential impact of g(y) means that the eﬀects of changes in the conditional debtincome relationship f (d|y) may be not be directly evident in the unconditional distributions.
21

11

Estimated βt s are presented in Figure 5 and confirm the alternative theory. Consider
first the Equifax estimates in the top panel.22 These estimates, which can be interpreted as
elasticities, lie in a fairly tight range between about 1.35 and 1.45, indicating that the βt s
change little over time. If anything, the income eﬀect grows slightly, with the 2006 coeﬃcient
about 0.07 higher than the 2001 coeﬃcient, a diﬀerence that is statistically significant but
economically small. Below, we investigate whether this increase resulted from between-city or
within-city movements in debt, but the important point here is that the regressions provide
no evidence that the conditional relationship between debt and income was reduced over
time.23
The bottom panel of Figure 5 presents household-level estimates using the SCF. Here,
the income coeﬃcients are estimated with a Poisson regression of mortgage debt on wage
income and other demographic variables.24 The SCF income coeﬃcients fluctuate modestly
over time, as they are somewhat elevated in 1989 and 2004 and lower than average in 2001
and 2010. As was the case with the zip code-level results, however, there is no evidence of a
sustained decline in the importance of income to debt from 2001 to 2007.

3.3

Debt and Income: Within-City and Between-City Movements

The regression specification above is easily adapted to study debt patterns within and between housing markets, although only the Equifax/IRS dataset is large enough for this
purpose. For the within-CBSA analysis we replace the intercept αt in the parametric model
with year-specific city fixed eﬀects,
E(dcit |ycit ) = αct + βt · ycit ,

(2)

22
The estimates in top panel of Figure 5 are not generated from separate regressions, but rather from
a pooled regression in which the constant and the income terms in equation 1 are interacted with yearly
dummies. The two methods are equivalent statistically, although the pooled regression turns out to be easier
to run. Like the scatter plots, the regressions are weighted by the number of returns in the zip code.
23
The standard error on the diﬀerence between the 2001 and 2006 income coeﬃcients is 0.02, and the
t-statistic on the diﬀerence is 3.8. Because the binned scatter plot of Equifax data in Figure 2 suggests that
the debt-income relation is not exactly log-linear (specifically, that the slope of the scatter plot is steeper
at low incomes), we ran some unreported regressions that also include the square of income-per-return. We
found that even though the implied relationship between debt and income is not perfectly linear in logs, the
relationship shifted upward uniformly across the income distribution, as the binned scatter plot suggests.
24
A Poisson regression of yi on xi is specified as yi = exp(α + βxi + ϵi ). For the SCF regressions, the
left-hand-side variable is the level (not log) of the household’s total mortgage debt and the regressor of
interest is the log of household wage income. The Poisson specification is preferred to a log-log specification
because the latter would exclude households with zero levels of debt. Households with zero levels of wage
income are excluded from the regressions, as are households with heads aged 65 years or older. In addition
to the log of household income, the regressions also include dummies for the age group of the household
head (younger than 35, 35–44, 45–54, and 55–64), the number of children, and dummies for nonwhite and
marital status. Like the Equifax/IRS regressions, the SCF regressions are run as a single pooled regression,
in which the right-hand-side variables are all interacted with yearly dummies.

12

so that a finding of β2006 < β2001 reflects a reallocation of debt toward zip codes with low
incomes relative to other areas in the same cities. The alternative story is that the withincity relationship between income and debt is stable (β2006 = β2001 ), so that changes in debt
among zip codes are driven by changes in the distribution of city-level eﬀects, αct .
The top two panels of Figure 6 investigate these alternatives. The binned scatter plot
in the top left panel is constructed by deviating both the debt and income variables from
CBSA means, separately in 2001 and 2006, and then averaging these deviations into 20 bins
for each year. Because debt and income are both measured as deviations, the overall increase
in debt during the boom is absorbed by the city averages, so both lines of points go through
the origin. There is no significant shift in the slope of these lines, and the top right panel
confirms the stability of the debt-income relationship with regressions.25 The estimated βt s
using CBSA fixed eﬀects rise very slightly from 2001 to 2002 and fall gently thereafter, so
that by 2006 the income coeﬃcient has essentially returned to its 2001 value. The exact
diﬀerence between the 2006 and 2001 coeﬃcients is –0.01, a gap that is neither economically
nor statistically significant.
The debt-income relationship across housing markets is analyzed in the lower two panels
of Figure 6. There are 937 CBSAs in the dataset, as opposed to more than 40,000 zip codes,
so we use 10 rather than 20 bins for the CBSA-level scatter plot in the lower left panel.
Unfortunately, even with a smaller number of bins, the CBSA-level plot is fairly choppy.
The panel does suggest a mild steepening in the between-city debt-income relationship,
however, and this pattern is borne out by the CBSA-level regressions in the lower right
panel.26 Thus, between-city movements help explain the small but statistically significant
increase of 0.07 that we found for the overall income eﬀect in the previous subsection, when
Equifax debt was regressed on IRS income without regard to the CBSA location of the zip
code.
To be clear, the regression estimates should not be interpreted as structural predictions
of how exogenous increases in income should aﬀect mortgage debt. For example, the acrossCBSA results could reflect causality that runs from booming local housing markets to rising
local incomes, not a causal relationship between city-wide income and city-wide debt. Indeed,
the possibility of reverse causality at the CBSA level is one reason why the within-CBSA
results are particularly useful. However, both the scatter plots and the reduced-form regressions are good ways to get a sense of how the cross-sectional relationship between debt
and income might have changed over time. And in neither the SCF nor the Equifax/IRS
datasets do these methods suggest a reallocation of mortgage debt toward low-income bor25

As noted in footnote 22, the regressions are run as a single pooled regression, so the introduction of
CBSA fixed eﬀects merely requires interacting CBSA dummies with the yearly dummies.
26
Specifically, there is an increase of 0.35 in the value of the city-wide income coeﬃcient from 2001 to
2006, which has a t-statistic of 2.3 and a p-value of 0.021.

The Extensive Margin of Mortgage Debt

4.1

Income and the Extensive Margin

The movements in total debt analyzed in the previous section take place along two potential
margins—the intensive margin (that is, the average amount of debt per borrower) and the
extensive margin (the total number of borrowers). In this section, we focus on the extensive margin of debt in light of frequent claims regarding an expansion of credit to marginal
borrowers. The first step in this analysis is to use SCF data to relate income to the presence of any mortgage debt on a household’s balance sheet—what we call “mortgageship.”
This concept is related to homeownership, but mortgageship and homeownership are not
equivalent because some people own their homes without any debt.27 To do this, we run
logit regressions of mortgageship on the household-specific variables that were also used in
the total-debt regressions in the lower panel of Figure 5.28 While they do not generate
structural estimates, the regressions determine whether current-income diﬀerences between
people with and without mortgages narrowed over time, as would be expected if growing
numbers of low-income individuals were able to take out mortgages.
The top panel of Figure 7 shows that the income coeﬃcients in the mortgageship regression trend higher from 2001 to 2007, suggesting that the current-income diﬀerences between
borrowers and non-borrowers grew modestly during the mortgage boom. The lower, fourpanel chart presents income coeﬃcients that are specific to age groups, which are generated
by interacting the age-group dummies with the income regressor. Because the vertical scales
in these panels are identical, they make it clear that income gaps between borrowers and
non-borrowers are widest among the youngest households. More important for our purposes
are the changes in income eﬀects over time. During the early 2000s, the income diﬀerences
distinguishing borrowers from non-borrowers rose the most among the youngest households,
but in no age group does the income diﬀerence decline significantly over time.
The Equifax dataset can be used to investigate the extensive margin of mortgage debt
at the zip-code level, by relating a zip code’s income to the share of its households that have
a mortgage. Figure 8 presents binned scatter plots of mortgaged-household shares against
27

The internet appendix shows that the income patterns we find for mortgageship are quite similar to the
mortgageship results presented in this section.
28
See footnote 24 for the list of regressors. As with the total-debt regression, the estimates are generated
by a single pooled regression in which all of the demographic factors are interacted with yearly dummies.
The estimated income eﬀects in the figure are marginal eﬀects on probabilities (not raw logit coeﬃcients),
so the top panel shows that an increase in wage income of 100 log points raises the expected homeownership
rate by around 20–25 percentage points, holding other demographic factors constant.

income in 2001 and 2006. The upper plot uses unadjusted income and mortgage share data,
while the bottom panel deviates those variables from CBSA means.29 As we might expect,
both panels indicate a positive relationship between a zip code’s income and the share of its
residents that have mortgage debt. A large part of the positive correlation undoubtedly flows
from higher rates of homeownership in high-income communities, but a zip code’s share of
mortgaged households is also determined by how many residents own their homes free and
clear. Indeed, at very high income levels, the plots flatten out, perhaps reflecting the larger
propensity of high-income persons to own their homes without any debt.
Most important are the changes in the relationship between debt and income over time.
The top plot shows that this relationship shifted over the course of the boom—but at the top
end of the income distribution, not the bottom. That is, in high-income zip codes, residents
became more likely to hold mortgage debt during the boom, conditional on income. No such
shift occurs at the other end of the income distribution. The lower panel of Figure 8 repeats
the analysis on a within-CBSA basis. Here, the conditional relationships have virtually
identical shapes, suggesting that the high-income shift in the top panel arises primarily from
between-CBSA shifts in mortgaged-household shares. This finding lines up well with the
importance of between–CBSA shifts for total debt illustrated by the regressions in section 3.

4.2

Credit Scores and the Extensive Margin

So far, the focus of this paper has been on mortgage debt and income, but a high-income
person can also be a bad credit risk and thus a marginal borrower. We therefore examine
the extensive margin using the individual-level Equifax Risk Scores.30 Any study of credit
scores and debt must confront two potential problems, the first being endogeneity. When a
borrower purchases a home and then makes a series of on-time payments, her credit score
typically rises. Reverse causation therefore influences the correlation between the presence
of mortgage debt and an individual’s current credit score. A second problem confounding
the study of credit scores and debt is that people typically borrow to buy homes early in
their adult lives. On average, young people have low credit scores, because they have yet to
build up substantial savings and have only managed debt for a short time. Consequently,
the life-cycle borrowing pattern exerts a negative influence on the cross-sectional relationship
between credit scores and debt, regardless of the current state of lending standards.
29

The share of households in a zip code that have a mortgage is calculated by taking the average of two
estimates. The upper bound is the number of outstanding first liens divided by the number of IRS tax
returns. This does not correct for joint mortgages. The lower bound is the number of “couples” in the
Equifax dataset with a mortgage: the number of people with a mortgage, with any joint mortgage divided
by two.
30
As noted below, the relationship between credit scores and mortgage debt is the key focus of Albanesi,
DeGiorgi, and Nosal (2016) and is also explored in Bhutta (2015).

15

Fortunately, information in the Equifax data allows us to circumvent both problems.
Although the New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel begins in 1999, it contains a variable
indicating the age of the oldest mortgage on record that is not covered in the dataset but
that is covered in Equifax’s master files. So, even though someone taking out a mortgage
in (say) 1985 may not have a “mortgage tradeline” for that loan in the Consumer Credit
Panel, a separate variable indicates that this person does have a mortgage originated in
1985. Unless the mortgage still has a positive balance during or after 1999, we will not know
the size of the 1985 mortgage, only its existence. Yet this knowledge is suﬃcient to identify
individuals taking out first mortgages after 1999, and focusing on the flow of those persons
into first-time borrowing solves the endogeneity problem that arises when borrowers make
on-time payments on existing stocks of debt. Of course, the flow of first-time borrowers
will include many young people, who tend to have low credit scores. But the potential bias
arising from the life-cycle borrowing pattern can be addressed by conditioning on age.
Figure 9 plots a collection of hazard ratios for individuals obtaining a mortgage for
the first time.31 For each year t, the denominator of the hazard ratio is the number of
persons in a given credit-score group who had not taken out a mortgage by year t-1. The
numerator is the flow of persons from this risk set who take out their first-ever mortgage
in year t. This approach builds on work in Bhutta (2015), who also investigates first-time
mortgage borrowing using Equifax data. An important diﬀerence between Figure 9 and
Bhutta (2015) is that the figure defines Equifax Risk Scores relative to CBSA means, in
order to hold constant factors that aﬀect the creditworthiness of individuals throughout
a given housing market.32 The top panel shows a near-monotonic relationship between
the probability of obtaining a first mortgage and creditworthiness throughout the sample
period. In all years, individuals in the two best credit-score categories are always most likely
to obtain a mortgage for the first time, and individuals in the bottom group are always the
least likely.33 Importantly, the probability of transitioning into mortgageship declines during
the mortgage boom for all credit-score groups. In absolute terms, declines for the highest
groups are more substantial because these groups start the housing boom with the highest
transition rates.
31

See the internet appendix for details regarding sample construction and a check of implied first-time
mortgageship rates against other data.
32
The CBSA-level means are generated from all residents of the CBSA appearing in the Equifax dataset,
not just those residents who have yet to obtain their first mortgage and are therefore included in the risk
set. Also, we analyze the hazard ratios using individual years rather than the two-year groupings in Bhutta
(2015) and we use a more-granular classification of credit scores.
33
From 2004 to 2007, the top credit-score group is marginally less likely to transition to mortgageship
than the second-best group. This pattern could indicate that the top group already owns homes free and
clear. As we will see, after subsetting by age, the top group of young persons is substantially more likely to
transition than the second-highest group in all years. This pattern indicates that a previous home purchase
is much less likely to be a confounding factor for individuals near the start of the life cycle.

16

The four panels in the bottom half of Figure 9 split the sample by age. Credit-score
quintiles are calculated within age groups, so the credit score of a young person in the top
quintile for her age group may be lower than that of an older person in a lower quintile.
Looking across panels, a hump-shaped hazard of first-time mortgageship can be inferred,
as transition rates are highest for 25–34 year-olds. Transition rates are monotonic for the
youngest two groups, as persons in the highest credit-score groups are always most likely to
flow into first-time mortgageship, those in the second group are second-most likely, and so on.
For the two older groups, however, individuals in the highest two groups have only moderate
transition rates. These age-specific patterns most likely result from selection: young people
with high credit scores are more likely to have high incomes than high wealth, so they still
must take on mortgage debt to acquire homes. Older people with high credit scores either
already own their homes or are wealthy enough to purchase them without debt. By and
large, however, no panel suggests a substantial extensive-margin shift in favor of poor credit
risks.
Results on the flow of persons into first-time borrowing complement the earlier extensivemargin analysis in two ways. First, the SCF regressions showed that current-income diﬀerences between borrowers and non-borrowers did not decline during the housing boom. Yet
these diﬀerences are influenced by labor market developments, which may have favored people likely to own homes over those likely to rent. For example, if technical change tilts the
distribution of income toward highly skilled workers, and if these workers are more likely to
own homes, then the income diﬀerences between mortgage borrowers and non-borrowers in
the SCF may grow, even if loosened lending standards allow more low-income people to buy
homes. Using the individual-level data in the Equifax data to study the flow into mortgage
borrowing is less susceptible to this potential confounding issue.
A second reason that Figure 9 is valuable is that it suggests that rising housing prices
during the boom had strong negative eﬀects on first-time buying across the credit-score
distribution. Loosened lending standards make it more likely that previously constrained
individuals will buy homes, holding other factors constant. But in the early 2000s, other
factors were not held constant, as house prices rose rapidly. The negative eﬀect of higher
prices appears to have oﬀset or outweighed the positive eﬀect of relaxed credit standards, so
that first-time buying among low-credit score groups declined during the mortgage boom,
along with first-time buying by everyone else. Given the sharp rise in house prices, perhaps
the truly surprising feature of the mortgage boom is not that most of the dollar increase in
mortgage debt went to the wealthy. The real surprise is that the low-income individuals,
who were the least likely to own homes at the start of the mortgage boom, were able to
increase their mortgage debt levels at the same rates as everyone else.
Later in the paper, we investigate how the growth of subprime lending helped low-income

17

individuals raise their debt levels at the same rates as high-income individuals did. Before
we do, we shift the focus from debt stocks and the flows into mortgageship to the two gross
flows of debt, mortgage originations and terminations. A gross-flow analysis provides some
helpful context for the housing boom, just as the study of gross job and worker flows has
generated valuable insights on labor markets (Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh 1996; Shimer
2005). Gross-flow analysis is also useful for showing how the results above relate to previous
studies of the mortgage boom.

5

Rising Mortgage Churn in Low-Income Areas

Figure 10 examines the zip code-level relationship between gross debt flows and income on
a within-CBSA basis.34 Each of the two rows of Figure 10 contains a binned scatter plot
of income and either originations (top row) or terminations (bottom row), along with the
plot of corresponding income coeﬃcients. The panels are therefore analogous to the panels
in the top row of Figure 6, which analyzed total debt stocks on a within-CBSA basis. In
contrast to the results for debt stocks, the relationships between income and the two gross
debt flows change over time. The binned scatter plots at left show a significant decline
in the positive relationship between the two flows and income; in each plot, the slopes for
the 2006 points are shallower than the slopes for the 2001 points. The two panels at right
express these changes as falling estimates of income coeﬃcients, which are generated from
regressions analogous to the earlier debt-stock regressions. Yet the shifts in originations and
terminations are the same. As a result of the oﬀsetting nature of these shifts, the gross flow
data imply that relative “mortgage churn” rose in low-income areas, even as relative debt
stocks remained stable.
What accounts for the rising churn in low-income areas? One factor is undoubtedly the
disproportionate participation of high-income borrowers in the refinancing boom of 2001–
2003.35 The reasons behind this boom are well known.36 Due in part to aggressive monetary
easing by the Federal Reserve during and after the 2001 recession, the 30-year mortgage
rate fell from around 81/2 percent in early 2000 to about 51/2 percent in mid-2003.37 Higher
levels of refinancing generate higher amounts of mortgage churn, and Figure 10 suggests that
high-income borrowers were more likely to participate in the 2001–2003 refinancing boom,
34

See the internet appendix for analogous results without zip code-level fixed eﬀects.
Because we do not have IRS income data for 2003, we cannot investigate the flow-income relationships
for that year. But it is likely that the 2003 income eﬀects for both originations and terminations were even
larger than the 2002 values.
36
For a discussion of the boom with a focus on cash-out refinancing, see Bhutta and Keys (2016).

consistent with previous research on the propensity to refinance.38 As this wave fell oﬀ after
2003, the relative amount of churn in low-income communities increased.
Another reason that relative mortgage churn increased in low-income communities is
that sales volumes rose. In theory, the Equifax data could be used to measure the number of
purchase-and-sale transactions that involved debt, but unfortunately we cannot consistently
distinguish purchases from refinances in that dataset. We can, however, construct a measure of “purchase-mortgage intensity” by dividing a zip code’s number of purchase-mortgage
originations (as measured by HMDA) by its number of first liens (as measured by Equifax).
The top panels of Figure 11 show that purchase-mortgage intensity rose in low-income communities from 2001 to 2006, looking across all zip codes (top left panel) or within CBSAs
(top right panel). The lower two panels correct the measure of purchase-mortgage intensity
for the presence of investors. In HMDA, each purchase mortgage is attached to the location
of the house being purchased, not the zip code of the purchaser, and these locations diﬀer in
the case of non-owner-occupiers. The lower panels of Figure 11 depict a purchase-mortgage
intensity measure that excludes investor purchases, and this correction substantially reduces
the relative increases in purchase-mortgage intensity in low-income areas over time.39 Although the corrected increases in low-income purchases are not particularly large, they do
contribute to rising relative rates of mortgage churn in low-income areas that are apparent
in Figure 10.
It is critical to understand, however, that higher purchase-mortgage intensity in lowincome areas does not indicate that mortgage debt was shifting down the income distribution,
because these purchase mortgages typically replaced the sellers’ mortgages on the homes
being transacted.40 As a result of this oﬀset, higher purchase-and-sale volumes have only
indirect impacts on overall mortgage debt and cannot be used to infer cross-sectional changes
in household balance sheets. Fortunately, the Equifax data allow us to correctly attach
38

In his presidential address to the American Finance Association, Campbell (2006) highlighted three
major financial mistakes often made by U.S. households, one of which is the failure to refinance a fixed-rate
mortgage when declining interest rates make it profitable to do so. Using early 2000s data from the American
Housing Survey, Campbell finds that “younger, smaller, better educated, better oﬀ, white households with
more expensive houses were more likely to refinance their mortgages between 2001 and 2003. These patterns
suggest that prompt refinancing requires financial sophistication” (p. 1581).
39
Investor information in the HMDA data must be used with caution, because an investor might inaccurately report his status as an owner-occupier during the loan-application process if doing so improves his
chance of approval. But this potential misreporting bias means that the number of investor purchases as
measured in the HMDA data is best considered a lower bound.
40
The impact of simultaneous originations and terminations on credit allocation plays an important role
in Gerardi and Willen (2009), which links HMDA data to property-level deed records in order to study
the eﬀect of subprime lending on urban neighborhoods in Massachusetts. The authors find that during the
housing boom, African-Americans accounted for a disproportionately large share of buyers in the state’s
urban neighborhoods. But African-Americans also accounted for an equally high percentage of sellers. The
implication is that subprime lending increased sales turnover without aﬀecting minority homeownership
rates.

mortgages to borrower locations and then keep track of mortgage debt stocks as well as
flows. Although we cannot separate total gross flows in Equifax into purchases, refinances,
and sales, we can measure both total stocks of debt and total gross flows. And as this section
has illustrated, we can tie stocks and flows together by showing how changes in the patterns
of the total gross flows oﬀset each another, leaving the distribution of mortgage debt stocks
stable over time.

Relationship to Other Research
Research on Debt and Income

Understanding that rising purchase-mortgage intensity does not necessarily signal a reallocation of debt is important for evaluating existing work on the housing boom. In an early
contribution, Mian and Sufi (2009) used HMDA data to argue that the boom had reallocated
debt toward low-income borrowers, a development they linked to incentive problems in the
origination and securitization of subprime loans. The key piece of evidence that led the authors to make this claim was that at the zip-code level, changes in HMDA purchase-mortgage
originations became negatively correlated with changes in incomes during the boom. One
can show that, using Mian and Sufi’s specific regression framework, the decline in the positive levels relationship between originations and income that we outlined in the previous
section would generate a negative correlation between debt and income changes, like the one
that Mian and Sufi found. Because Mian and Sufi looked primarily at purchase-mortgage
originations and did not ask whether these originations were oﬀset by terminations, they
misinterpreted the increase in mortgage churn in low-income areas as a credit expansion to
low-income borrowers.
In a recent paper, Adelino, Schoar, and Severino (2016) also argue that Mian and Sufi
misinterpreted an increase in mortgage churn in low-income areas, but data issues prevented
them from fully examining the empirical consequences of that result. Much of the analysis
in Adelino, Schoar, and Severino (2016) uses HMDA data on purchase-mortgage flows, but
the paper exploits the borrower-level nature of HMDA data to separate that gross flow into
two components: the number of new purchase mortgages in a zip code and the average
amount of each individual mortgage. Adelino, Schoar, and Severino (2016) shows that the
key results in Mian and Sufi (2009) result from higher mortgage churn—what they call
the “velocity” of mortgage origination—not from residents of low-income zip codes getting
larger mortgages. In fact, the authors found that in relative terms, average mortgage size rose
more in high-income zip codes than in low-income zip codes. The implication of this positive
correlation between changes in average mortgage size and income was that “[t]he apparent

20

decoupling of zip code-level credit growth and per capita income growth [implied by Mian
and Sufi’s negative correlation] is due solely to the negative relation between the number of
new originations and per capita income growth” (p. 1637, insertion added). While Adelino,
Schoar, and Severino (2016) recognized that higher mortgage churn is critical to Mian and
Sufi’s original finding, they were unable to explore the implication of that result because
they lacked data on debt stocks and mortgaged-household shares at the zip-code level. They
were therefore unable to determine whether the rising numbers of originations they found in
low-income areas simply reflected higher transaction volumes or instead signaled that larger
numbers of low-income borrowers were buying homes, which is the definition of an extensivemargin expansion of credit. The inability of HMDA data to rule out the extensive-margin
possibility highlights the need for data on debt stocks and shares of mortgaged households,
which can rule out that possibility.41
The debate about gross-flow patterns continues in Mian and Sufi (2016a), which argues
that average mortgage size displays a small negative correlation with zip code-level income
after accounting properly for second liens.42 Mian and Sufi therefore claim that it is incorrect
to state, as Adelino and coauthors did, that the negative correlation in their original 2009
paper resulted completely from higher churn in low-income areas, with no contribution from
average mortgage size. While potentially interesting, this new finding has no bearing on our
results. First, whether average mortgage size in low-income zip codes rose or fell slightly
does not invalidate the finding that mortgage churn rose in low-income areas, and that
this increase was originally confused in the literature with a significant credit expansion to
low-income borrowers. Second, the apportionment of purchase-mortgage flows into average
mortgage size and transaction volumes is a second-order issue. As we have illustrated, data
on mortgage stocks can be used to directly measure the distribution of mortgage debt as well
as any shifts in shares of mortgaged households over time, which are the ultimate objects of
interest when calculating household debt burdens.43
41

Adelino, Schoar, and Severino (2016) includes one figure that uses SCF data to measure stocks of debt,
but that figure does not include data from people with zero debt, so it does not address the potential for
a credit expansion along the extensive margin. Also, as noted above, the relatively small size of the SCF
means that the Equifax data are needed to measure debt shifts across and between housing markets—a
crucial distinction in Mian and Sufi (2009).
42
The presence of second liens means that the number of total mortgage applications is larger than the
number of purchase-and-sale transactions. Using the latter concept as the denominator when calculating
average mortgage size generates a modest negative correlation of average size with income growth.
43
Mian and Sufi (2016a) is also critical of the use of borrower-level income data in HMDA by Adelino,
Schoar, and Severino (2016), because, Mian and Sufi claim, these data are more likely to be fraudulent in
low-income zip codes. That critique is not relevant to this paper, because we never use HMDA data to
measure income.

6.2

Research on Credit Scores and Income

Another research project related to ours is Albanesi, DeGiorgi, and Nosal (2016), which
focuses on the relationship between debt and credit scores, not debt and income. As noted
above, the endogenous feedback between debt and credit scores is likely to be larger than that
between debt and income. Although taking out a mortgage to buy a home might raise one’s
income, doing so will almost certainly raise one’s credit score if the subsequent mortgage
payments are made on time.44 Figure 12 illustrates the endogenous relationship between
credit scores and debt in a way that clarifies both the contribution of Albanesi, DeGiorgi,
and Nosal (2016) and some responses to their work. The figure presents a series of debt
statistics for a random sample of individuals in the Equifax sample as of 1999, the dataset’s
initial year. The individuals are divided into separate groups corresponding to age in 1999
and Equifax Risk Scores in 1999. The top panel shows, first, that individuals in middle
age had higher average levels of mortgage debt in 1999, and second, that within each age
group, debt was positively related to credit score.45 Both findings are intuitive. Middle-aged
persons, who have recently entered their prime home-buying years, tend to have significant
mortgage balances that are paid oﬀ as they grow older. And the positive relationship between
debt and income within age groups reflects the two-way street of causality between debt and
credit scores: persons with high scores can amass more debt, and having debt tends to raise
one’s score if payments are made on time.
Now consider a basic question about the mortgage boom: who took out the most debt,
individuals with high credit scores in 1999 or low ones? It would be unsurprising to find that
persons with low scores in 1999 took on the most debt in the mortgage boom, because young
people, who tend to have low credit scores, take on mortgage debt to become homeowners in
the normal state of aﬀairs. We might therefore investigate debt growth within age groups.
The middle panel of Figure 12 graphs the average dollar-value increases in debt for persons
in the various demographic bins. The general within-age pattern of debt growth is positive,
as individuals with high credit scores in 1999 subsequently added more dollars to their debt
balances than similarly aged persons with lower scores.46 The bottom panel of Figure 12
measures debt increases relative to each group’s initial debt level. Now the within age-group
relationship between debt growth and 1999 credit score is negative. That is, abstracting
from individuals with the lowest credit scores (300-499), the bars in the bottom panel of
Figure 12 get smaller within each age group as 1999 credit scores rise.
44

As noted, our analysis of the flow of persons into first-time mortgageship status is not aﬀected by this
problem, as it abstracts from the eﬀect of current debt on credit scores: no one in the risk set for transition
into mortgage borrowing has any debt to begin with.
45
The positive relation between debt and credit score is monotonic for all but the oldest age group.
46
The positive relation is monotonic for the youngest age group and for the lower three credit-score groups
among older age groups.

22

Because the relative changes in the bottom row are defined as the absolute changes in the
middle row divided by the initial levels in the top row, it is easy to see why measuring debt
growth in relative or absolute terms gives diﬀerent answers about the boom. The middle
panel shows that the better credit risks within each age group added more dollars to their
debt levels between 1999 and 2007, but they started in 1999 with relatively more debt, too.
The extra dollars they added were not enough to outweigh the eﬀect of their high initial
debt levels, so relative to their initial debt levels, their debt increases were lower than the
increases for lower-score groups. The key factor driving these results is the endogeneity of
the credit score in 1999, which reflects the ability of good credit risks to borrow more early
on as well as the positive impact that their 1999 debt levels had on their 1999 credit scores.
Albanesi, DeGiorgi, and Nosal (2016) address the endogeneity concerns by essentially
running the following regression:
∆Dit
= α + βScorei,t−2 + ε,
Di0

(3)

where the left-hand side variable is the relative growth in mortgage debt D for individual i
from an initial year zero to year t, and the regressor is the individual’s credit score lagged by
two years.47 This specification can be thought of as intermediate choice between two polar
cases. One polar case would regress relative debt growth on the individual’s year-0 credit
score: Scorei,0 . As we have seen, life-cycle eﬀects would bias downward this within-agegroup estimate of β, because first-time home buyers are often young, and young people tend
to have low credit scores. Even if age terms were added to the regression, causing β to be
identified solely from within age-group comparisons, the mean reversion illustrated by the
bottom panel of Figure 12 would continue to bias downward the coeﬃcient. Additionally,
using 1999 credit scores gives an increasingly out-of-date estimate of creditworthiness as
time passes, and at the same time it prevents anyone entering the dataset after 1999 from
contributing to the analysis. At the other polar extreme, we could regress debt growth on
the time-t credit score: Scorei,t . In this case β would be biased upward if poor credit risks
were exogenously extended credit during the boom and the mere extension of this credit
raised their credit scores. By choosing a specification that lies between these two extremes,
Albanesi, DeGiorgi, and Nosal (2016) hope to arrive at a specification that is as close as
possible to the truth.
Clearly, sorting out the endogenity issues related to credit scores is an important topic
for future work. But so far, no substantial evidence has emerged that debt was reallocated
47
In practice, regressions of this type are not run on individual data, but rather on data that has been
grouped along demographic characteristics, as in Figure 12. The main advantage of using grouped data is
that doing so obviates the need to figure out what to do with individuals who have zero debt in the initial
year.

23

toward bad credit risks during the boom.48 The specification of Albanesi, DeGiorgi, and
Nosal (2016) indicates that debt rose by at least 50 percent for all credit-score quartiles
during the boom, and that the largest growth rates were in the center of the credit-score
distribution. These findings are consistent with our results on the expansive nature of the
mortgage boom across the income distribution. And our own credit-score analysis—which
is based on the flow of persons into first-time borrowing and is thus less aﬀected by reverse
causation than the analysis of debt stocks—provides no evidence that persons with poor
credit risks found it easier to enter mortgageship as the mortgage boom progressed.

7

What About Subprime?

The emerging research on the broadly based nature of the mortgage boom contradicts the
common characterization of the mortgage boom as a subprime event, driven primarily by
the disproportionate use of a complex mortgage instrument that turned toxic during the
bust. Subprime mortgages and other forms of privately securitized debt did play a critical
role in the 2008 financial crisis, because losses on those mortgages were not insured by the
government, as were the prime loans packaged into agency securities by Fannie Mae, Freddie
Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises. But a close look at both outstanding
stocks of debt and foreclosures confirms that the housing cycle was just that—a housing
cycle—and not a subprime cycle alone.

7.1

Subprime Debt and Income

The first step in this analysis is simply to measure the amount of subprime debt, and in
Figure 13 we focus on the subprime loans that were subsequently packaged into privatelabel mortgage backed securities. During the mortgage boom these securities included most
subprime and Alt-A mortgages and some jumbo prime loans as well.49 The heavy black
line in the top panel of Figure 13 depicts the total amount of home mortgage debt on
the liability side of household balance sheets as measured by the Federal Reserve’s Flow of
Funds. The lighter gray line is a counterfactual amount of mortgage debt that would have
occurred if the only growth in mortgage-debt liabilities after 2001:Q1 had been privately
48

Mian and Sufi (2016b) also investigate individual-level growth in debt using the Equifax records, with
a specification that is essentially equation 3 augmented with age eﬀects. As Figure 12 illustrates, however,
mean reversion is likely to bias the resulting estimate of β downward, and thereby overstate the relative debt
growth enjoyed by poor credit risks.
49
According to the Mortgage Market Statistical Annual, securitization rates for subprime and Alt-A loans
as a class ranged from around two-thirds in 2002 to around 80 percent in 2005 and 2006. Securitization rates
for prime jumbo loans ranged from about one-third to one-half over the same period.

24

securitized debt, which is also available in the Flow of Funds.50 The chart shows that some
time after 2003, growth in privately securitized debt accounted for a nontrivial fraction of
the growth in overall mortgage debt. But the large majority of debt accumulated during the
mortgage boom was allocated outside of the private-label securities channel, through avenues
that included portfolio lending, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), state and local
housing authorities, and other sources.
The Flow of Funds does not disaggregate privately securitized debt into subprime, Alt-A,
and prime jumbo loans. However, we can calculate the size of these components by aggregating the loan-level records in the CoreLogic ABS Private Label Securities ABS Database
discussed in the data section. The red dashed line in the bottom panel of Figure 13 shows
how much total mortgage debt would have grown if the only debt growth after 2001:Q1
had been privately securitized subprime loans. According to the aggregated CoreLogic data,
outstanding subprime debt grew from about $100 billion in 2001:Q1 to about $955 billion by
the middle of 2007, for an increase of about $855 billion. The dashed blue line in the panel
adds the even larger increase in Alt-A debt, which rose from about $60 billion in 2001:Q1 to
about $1.04 trillion by mid-2007, an increase of about $980 billion. The last counterfactual,
depicted by the dashed gray line, adds the relatively small amount of growth in prime jumbo
securities. The main message is that even though subprime debt grew nontrivially during
the mortgage boom, the vast majority of new mortgage debt was generated though other
channels.
The relative unimportance of subprime debt may seem odd to those who remember the
wide attention that subprime originations received during the mortgage boom. But the stockflow distinction we note many times above is especially important when studying subprime
mortgages. For the most part, these mortgages were designed to be refinanced quickly, so
the higher originations would have coincided with higher terminations.51 The quantitative
relationship between originations and stocks of subprime debt is illustrated by Figure 14,
where the top panel depicts the share of subprime and Alt-A origination values as shares
of all new originations during the 2000s. The red line shows that subprime accounted for
about 20 percent of new origination values from 2004 to 2006. The bottom panel provides
data on outstanding stocks of subprime and Alt-A loans that were privately securitized as
a share of all mortgage debt. The subprime share hits a point of inflection in 2004, when
subprime originations take oﬀ. But because any rapid increase in a flow generates a less50

The privately securitized debt level is the total amount of debt issued by asset-backed securities (ABS)
issuers on mortgages for 1–4 family structures. In mortgage data, privately securitized debt is labeled ABS
debt to distinguish it from the MBS that are backed by the government-sponsored agencies.
51
One of the most common types of subprime mortgages had a so-called hybrid structure, in which the
interest rate would be fixed for the first two or three years of the loan, and then reset to float at a rate
that was several percentage points above a benchmark short-term rate. The thinking was that the borrower
would refinance at or shortly before the reset.

25

rapid increase in the corresponding stock, and because large amounts of subprime debt were
being terminated as the new subprime mortgages were being originated, the corresponding
increase in the subprime stock of debt was modest. Privately securitized subprime debt
peaked at just over 9 percent of total outstanding mortgage debt in 2006. This share was
comparable to the share of privately securitized Alt-A debt, which generally consisted of
reduced-documentation loans to borrowers with prime credit scores.
To study the cross-sectional allocation of private-label debt with respect to income, we
combine loan-level CoreLogic data with the zip code-level Equifax/IRS dataset. Specifically,
for each zip code in the Equifax/IRS data, we figure the total amount of subprime and ABS
debt in CoreLogic. Then, for each zip code, we subtract these totals from the total amount of
Equifax mortgage debt, which generates the amount of prime debt as a remainder. Figure 15
shows the average contributions of subprime, Alt-A, and prime debt to growth rates of total
debt across the income distribution of zip codes from 2001 to 2006. The top panel ranks zip
codes based on wage and salary income without regard to their CBSA location. As we would
expect, the panel shows that subprime debt growth grew at faster rates in low-income areas,
although some residents of wealthy zip codes also took out subprime loans. The bottom panel
bins the zip codes based on their incomes relative to CBSA means. The story here is generally
the same, although the negative relationship between the importance of subprime debt and
average zip code-level income appears somewhat greater. Combined with the earlier results
on the overall stability of the debt distribution, the relatively small amount of subprime
debt and its disproportionate allocation to low-income communities indicates that subprime
did not cause a reallocation of debt toward low-income borrowers and communities. But by
allowing these communities to keep up with aggregate housing demand, subprime lending
helped prevent a reallocation of mortgage debt toward the wealthy.

7.2

Foreclosures and Income

Of course, the attention paid to the increase in subprime during the boom paled in comparison to the headlines that subprime received during the bust. As noted by Ferreira and
Gyourko (2015), most economics papers written early in the crisis focused on the large
number of subprime foreclosures, and thereby encouraged focusing on potential incentive
problems in the subprime origination and securitization models. This focus undoubtedly
received additional encouragement from the importance of subprime losses to the financial
crisis. But using a large sample of public deeds records data that cover 96 metropolitan areas,
Ferreira and Gyourko (2015) also show that defaults during the course of the housing bust
occurred on prime mortgages. To be sure, subprime mortgages had higher default rates. But
because they made up a relatively small share of mortgages, Ferreira and Gyourko (2015)
estimate more than twice as many prime as subprime borrowers lost their homes over their
26

full sample period (2009:Q1–2012:Q3).
The high proportion of subprime lending in low-income communities leads naturally
to the question of how mortgage defaults were distributed across the income distribution.
The cross-sectional relationship between foreclosures and either income or credit scores has
received much recent attention. For example, Adelino, Schoar, and Severino (2016) use data
from HMDA and the McDash mortgage-servicer dataset to infer that foreclosure rates are
typically higher in low-income communities, as we would expect. However, the paper also
shows that during the housing bust, the share of total McDash delinquency value accounted
for by low-income zip codes went down. This movement occurred because the percentage
increases in the (generally high) delinquency rates of low-income zip codes were smaller than
the percentage increases in the (generally low) rates of high-income areas.
We can replicate and extend these results using the Equifax data.52 Individual mortgages
in Equifax are classified as either current or delinquent, with the latter group further delineated by length of delinquency: 30, 60, 90, or 120+ days. The Equifax dataset is quarterly,
so we can define the default rate in quarter t as the share of all active first liens in quarter
t − 1 that transition to 90-day delinquency in quarter t.53 The two panels in Figure 16
present binned scatter plots of the log of this default rate against log of income per return
in 2001:Q4 and 2009:Q4. As was the case with debt, the use of natural logs means that a
uniform percentage increase in defaults shows up as a uniform shift upward across the income
distribution. The upper panel of Figure 16 shows the default-income relationship across all
zip codes without regard to CBSA location. The lower panel deviates both variables from
CBSA means. Both panels show a strong negative relationship between default rates and
income, as defaults are always higher in low-income zip codes. But the plots also confirm
that the default rate grew somewhat more in percentage terms in high-income zip codes, as
the slopes of the conditional expectation functions flatten from 2001 to 2009.54
For our purposes, what is most striking about these plots is how they mirror the earlier
results on mortgage debt, and thus support the idea that the housing cycle was an aggregate
event. High-income borrowers tend to have a lot of mortgage debt, so an aggregate increase
52

An extension is useful because, as noted in the data section, the McDash dataset does not become fully
representative of the mortgage market until 2005. We also focus on foreclosure rates, rather than shares
of total delinquency value, because the latter measure is influenced by diﬀerences in the average size of
mortgages across zip codes, as well as diﬀerences in homeownership rates.
53
The resulting ratio is, of course, similar to a sample hazard. We define the number of active first liens
in the previous quarter as all liens that are fewer than 90 days delinquent. These liens, therefore, comprise
the risk set for loans that can become 90 days delinquent in the current quarter.
54
In a paper that uses individual-level credit scores rather than zip code-level income, Mian and Sufi
(2016b) also find that the share of housing distress accounted for by the relatively creditworthy borrowers
rose during the bust. But that paper’s use of 1996 credit scores understates the total share of defaults during
the housing bust that was generated by high-score borrowers, because borrower scores tend to rise with age
(and thus with time).

27

in debt across all borrowers leads to large dollar-value increases in debt among the rich. Conversely, low-income borrowers have relatively high foreclosure rates, so the same percentage
increase in defaults among all borrowers generates large absolute numbers of low-income
foreclosures. While many of these low-income foreclosures were on subprime mortgages, the
relatively small share of subprime on the overall market meant that, as Ferreira and Gyourko (2015) found, most defaults would come on prime mortgages. And the slightly larger
percentage increases in foreclosures among richer communities—who were underrepresented
in subprime—provides a further indication that the housing bust was not limited to the
subprime market alone. All told, cross-sectional analysis of both debt accumulation and
foreclosures indicates that research should focus on the aggregate factors behind the housing
cycle, not on potential problems that are specific to any particular corner of the market.

8

Implications for Theory and Policy

If the bottom line of this paper is that aggregate factors drove the housing cycle, then
the obvious follow-up question is what those factors were. One candidate is an exogenous
expansion in the supply of loanable funds that reduced mortgage rates in the U.S. housing
market. The interest-rate hypothesis is examined in detail by Glaeser, Gottlieb, and Gyourko
(2013), as part of a broader examination of whether “cheap credit” can explain the boom.55
The authors find that neither theory nor data support the interest-rate hypothesis. “Interest
rates do influence house prices,” they write, “but they cannot provide anything close to a
complete explanation of the great housing market gyrations between 1996 and 2010” (p. 350).
The authors conclude by noting that overly optimistic house-price expectations could have
fueled the boom, as borrowers would have wanted to buy houses that were rising in price, and
lenders would have been eager to write mortgages against this rapidly appreciating collateral.
Shifting beliefs can also explain widespread foreclosures during the bust. When beliefs
became less optimistic and housing prices fell, homeowners across the income distribution
found themselves with negative equity, a necessary condition of default (Kau, Keenan, and
Kim 1994).
The expectations theory of the housing cycle is supported by a number of facts about
mortgage finance during the past several decades (Foote, Gerardi, and Willen 2012), and
it is easy to find evidence that both borrowers and lenders were optimistic about houseprice appreciation during the mortgage boom (Case and Shiller 2003; Case, Shiller, and
Thompson 2012; Gerardi et al. 2008). But constructing a rational model of shifting beliefs
55

This investigation into cheap credit as a potential driver of the cycle involved the availability of credit
as well as its price. Glaeser, Gottlieb, and Gyourko (2013) correlated house prices with both loan-approval
rates and average down payments, but found that the empirical impact of these two factors on prices was
limited as well.

28

about future house prices is a theoretical challenge. A recent paper by Kaplan, Mitman,
and Violante (2016) captures “bubble psychology” in a rational-expectations framework
by assuming that agents move exogenously between two regimes regarding future housing
preferences. In one regime, the agents believe that preferences for housing will be much
higher in the future, while the other regime is less optimistic. Survey data on house-price
expectations are used to calibrate this shock. Two other shocks occur to regulation in the
mortgage market (summarized by household borrowing limits and borrowing costs) and to
labor income. The recent U.S. housing cycle is then characterized as a particular set of
shocks to beliefs, regulation, and income.
The belief shock emerges as by far the most important driver of housing prices in the
Kaplan, Mitman, and Violante (2016) model. The importance of regulation shocks, by
contrast, is tempered by the presence of an elastic rental market. The authors explain that
in general, changes in borrowing constraints will matter to the aggregate housing market
only if a substantial number of agents are constrained beforehand. In their model, the
housing choices of households are not constrained very much, because households without the
requisite down payment can simply rent. Moreover, whenever down payment restrictions are
relaxed, these households wind up buying houses that are comparable to the ones they would
have been renting, with minimal eﬀects on aggregate housing demand or house prices.56 More
to the point of this paper, the model predicts that household debt levels rise proportionately
across the income distribution, as long as optimistic beliefs about the housing market are
widely shared.
Other theoretical questions follow naturally from the importance of beliefs to the housing
cycle. Kaplan, Mitman, and Violante (2016) takes the shift in beliefs as exogenous, but papers in the so-called distorted beliefs literature go beyond the standard rational-expectations
framework to ask how beliefs can be aﬀected by psychological factors, social interactions, or
both.57
56

Expanded credit availability also has a small eﬀect on housing prices in the model of Kiyotaki,
Michaelides, and Nikolov (2011): “In our economy, tenants or credit-constrained homeowners are relatively
poor and own a small share of aggregate wealth as a group. As a result, the eﬀect of relaxing the collateral
constraint on housing prices is largely absorbed by a modest conversion from rented to owned units” (p. 257).
Interestingly, the authors model can match the empirical skews in the earnings and wealth distributions,
but a general implication of Krusell and Smith (1998) still holds: In heterogeneous-agent economies, the
behaviour of the poorest agents has a limited eﬀect on wealth aggregates, because the share of total wealth
held by these agents is small.
57
Papers that explore the formation of beliefs and the financial consequences of distorting them include
Gennaioli and Shleifer (2010), Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny (2012), Barberis (2013), Brunnermeier, Simsek,
and Xiong (2014), Simsek (2013), Fuster, Laibson, and Mendel (2010), Geanakoplos (2009), and Burnside,
Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2016). In addition to Adelino, Schoar, and Severino (2016), empirical papers
supporting the price-expectations theory include Cheng, Raina, and Xiong (2014) and Bayer, Mangum,
and Roberts (2016). In the internet appendix, we discuss a contrasting theory of the debt boom proposed
by Kumhof, Rancière, and Winant (2015), who link increases in overall debt to consumption rather than
investment motives.

29

The aggregate nature of the housing cycle also raises important questions for policy.
If a surge in unaﬀordable mortgages targeted at low-income borrowers had in fact caused
a destabilizing housing cycle, then restricting non-traditional mortgages would have been
good for both the macroeconomy and the borrowers themselves. But trade-oﬀs emerge if
subprime instead helped low-income borrowers keep up with everyone else. Restricting subprime lending would have reduced low-income borrowing and thus reduced the number of
ensuing foreclosures. Yet the small amount of debt at the bottom of the income distribution suggests that this policy would not have derailed the boom itself, and most defaults
turned out to be on prime mortgages anyway. More importantly, the relationship between
foreclosures and income implies that restricting low-income lending will always reduce the
foreclosure rate, because foreclosure is more common in low-income areas than high-income
areas. Indeed, authors such as Goodman (2016) believe that after the housing crisis, the
“credit box” shrank too much from a social point of view, causing too many people to be shut
oﬀ from the benefits of homeownership.58 If society believes that homeownership has positive
externalities and should thus be widely shared, then regulators should be willing to tolerate
a higher number of average foreclosures as credit flows down the income distribution. On
the other hand, the case for low-income lending is weakened if foreclosure externalities are
large, or if we believe that large declines in nationwide housing prices can no longer be ruled
out. This paper has outlined how the distribution of mortgage debt did evolve during the
mortgage boom. Its findings imply that the policy question of how this distribution should
evolve in the future is more complicated than conventional explanations of the mortgage
boom would suggest.

58
The title of Goodman (2016) states that “squeaky-clean loans [have led] to near-zero borrower defaults—
and that is not a good thing.”

2015:Q4. Note: The mortgage debt ratio in the top panel is defined as total home mortgage liabilities in
the household sector divided by total personal disposable income for the household and nonprofit sector.
The income variable is seasonally adjusted at an annual rate. The homeownership rate in the lower panel
is also seasonally adjusted. The gray vertical lines in each panel denote the quarters 2001:Q1 and 2007:Q4.

Figure 2. The Relationship between Mortgage Debt and Income among U.S. Households
(Left Panels) and Zip Codes (Right Panels). Note: The panels at left use data from the Survey of
Consumer Finances to depict the household-level relationship between wage income and mortgage debt in
2001 and 2007. The panels at right use debt data from the Equifax credit bureau and income data from
the Internal Revenue Service to show the zip code-level relationship in these variables in 2001 and 2006.
Households with no wage income in the SCF and zip codes with no reported wage and salary income from
the IRS are not included. Source: NY Fed Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax, IRS Statistics of Income, and

Table 1. Summary Statistics for Zip Codes in the Equifax/IRS Dataset. Note: Values at the zipcode level are summarized by return-weighted salary and wages per return quintiles from the IRS, so there
are approximately the same number of returns in each quintile. The reported values are return-weighted
medians within each quintile. Average mortgage debt is the total stock of mortgage debt divided by the
number of people in the zip code holding a mortgage, after correcting for joint mortgages. The average
value of each type of mortgage is the total stock of debt for that mortgage type divided by the number
of outstanding mortgages of that type in each zip code. The percentage of mortgaged households is the
number of couples or individuals holding a mortgage divided by the number of returns from the IRS. The
median house price is from Zillow, and house price appreciation at the zip-code level is calculated from the
CoreLogic zip code-level house price index. Source: NY Fed Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax, IRS Statistics

Figure 4. Distributions of Mortgage Debt. Note: All densities are weighted kernel densities of the log of household-level mortgage debt (SCF
distribution in top left panel) or average zip code-level mortgage debt per tax return (Equifax distributions in remaining panels). Household-level
weights are used for the SCF distribution, and the number of income tax returns in the zip code is used to weight the Equifax distributions. The
bottom left panel depicts Equifax densities after the log of zip code-level debt per return is deviated from means corresponding to Core Based
Statistical Areas (CBSAs). The bottom right panel depicts the kernel densities of CBSA averages of debt. In all three distributions using the Equifax
data, zip codes outside of CBSAs are excluded. Source: Survey of Consumer Finances, NY Fed Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax and IRS Statistics

Figure 5. Regression Evidence on the Relationship between Mortgage Debt and Income
among U.S. Zip Codes and Households. Note: The top panel graphs income coeﬃcients (and 95
percent confidence intervals) from a returns-weighted regression of zip code-level mortgage debt on income
for all years between 2001 and 2007, save for 2003 (when IRS income data are not available). Coeﬃcients
are generated from a single pooled regression that includes interactions of the income variable with yearly
dummies, and standard errors are clustered by CBSA (not CBSA-year). The bottom panel depicts income
coeﬃcients from a pooled Poisson regression for household debt in the SCF, in which the log of wage and
salary income, dummies for the age of the household head (younger than 35, 35–44, 45–54, and 55–64), the
number of children, and dummies for nonwhite and marital status are each interacted with yearly dummies.
Households with heads 65 and older and households with no wage income are excluded. The reported
coeﬃcients are averages of estimates using the five implicates of the SCF. Standard errors are calculated as in
Rubin (1987), but with no degrees-of-freedom adjustment. Source: NY Fed Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax
and IRS Statistics of Income, and Survey of Consumer Finances.

Internet Appendix
Comparisons of Mortgage Debt, Income, and Debt Growth

Figure A.1 compares two aggregations of individual-level Equifax mortgage-debt balances
from the New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel. The level of aggregation is either the state
or the county. The horizontal axis of each panel measures our aggregation of debt for the
given geographical unit, while the vertical axis measure aggregates that are calculated and
published by the New York Fed itself. In all panels, the dots lie along 45-degree lines, giving
us confidence that we are aggregating up to the zip-code level correctly when we construct
our main cross-sectional dataset.
In the text, Figure 3 compared the aggregate number of returns from the zip code-level
data with the aggregate number of returns published by IRS; the latter series omits any
return filed for the sole purpose of receiving an economic-stimulus payment. In most years,
the total number of returns in the zip code-level data is smaller than the IRS’s published
total, in part because of the suppression rules. But as Figure 3 shows, in 2007 the zip codelevel data imply many more returns, because these data include returns filed for the sole
purpose of receiving stimulus checks. Figure A.2 compares aggregates of IRS income data
rather than numbers of returns. The blue lines in this figure are national aggregates of either
salary and wage income (top panel) or AGI (bottom panel) published by IRS. The red dots
are aggregated data from the zip code-level IRS dataset that we use in the paper. In both
panels, the published aggregate is larger than the zip code-level aggregate, probably because
of the suppression rules that IRS applies to the zip code-level dataset before they release it.
Even so, the two income aggregates follow similar time-series patterns—even in 2007, when
the number of returns filed spikes up.
Figure A.3 compares estimates of the aggregate stock of mortgage debt from the Flow
of Funds, the Equifax dataset, and the SCF in those years for which the SCF data are
available. The Equifax totals are close to, but somewhat smaller than, the SCF and Flowof-Funds totals. Yet our Equifax debt totals are essentially identical to some unreported
Equifax totals calculated by Brown et al. (2015), who compare Equifax data with the SCF
along a number of dimensions.59 Two SCF aggregates are presented. The first comes from
Henriques and Hsu (2014), who compare various SCF aggregates to their Flow of Funds
counterparts. Even though Flow of Funds data are typically constructed from administrative
records supplied by financial institutions and government agencies, rather than from surveys,
59

Specifically, in billions of 2010 dollars, Brown et al. (2015) estimate total mortgage debt in Equifax in
2004, 2007, and 2010 to be $7,631, $10,034, and $9,282, respectively. Our Equifax totals expressed in the
same units and years are $7,741, $9,728, and $9,074. In addition, unreported work shows that our totals are
close to those reported Bhutta (2015), which also analyzes mortgage debt in the New York Fed Consumer
Credit Panel.

Henriques and Hsu (2014) show that most balance-sheet measures in the SCF are close to the
corresponding Flow of Funds estimates. This comparability is particularly true for mortgage
debt, a pattern the authors attribute to the clarity of the mortgage debt concept and the
stability of mortgage data collection procedures in both the SCF and the Flow of Funds over
time. Figure A.3 replicates the close correspondence between mortgage debt in the Flow of
Funds and Henriques and Hsu’s SCF measure. Gratifyingly, the figure also shows that our
SCF aggregates, based on the public-use summary SCF datasets, are essentially identical to
Henriques and Hsu’s, with the small diﬀerences between them probably resulting from the
fact that we use the public-use version of the data. Note that comparability of the SCF
data to the mortgage measure in the Flow of Funds requires the use of all mortgage data
available, including HELOCs. This is why we include HELOCs and other types of secondary
mortgages when using either the Equifax dataset or the SCF.60

A.2

AGI vs. Wages and Salaries and 2006 vs. 2007

Throughout the paper we use salary and wages to measure income, because this type of
income is most likely to be the focus of lenders when they evaluate mortgage applications.
An alternative choice would be to use AGI (for zip code-level analysis) and total income
(for SCF analysis). Figure A.4 shows that our main results hold even when this alternative
choice is made. The two left panels use zip code-level data from Equifax, with quintiles
calculated using AGI per tax return. The two right panels use data from the SCF, with
the quintiles calculated using the SCF’s measure of total income. The top panels show the
same similarity in debt evident in Figure 2 in the main text in both the zip code-level data
and the SCF. The lower panels replicate the finding that, because mortgage debt rises with
income in the cross section, equal debt-growth rates imply very large dollar amounts of new
debt for the richest borrowers.
The main text also uses 2006 rather than 2007 as the last year of the mortgage boom
when performing zip code-level analysis. (The ending-year issue is not relevant for the SCF.)
This choice is necessitated by the spike in tax filing in 2007 illustrated in the text by Figure
3 and discussed earlier in this appendix. Recall that Figure A.2 implied that the additional
filers had very low incomes, because their tax returns had little eﬀect on 2007 levels of total
AGI or of wages and salaries. Further evidence that the extra filers had low incomes appears
in Figure A.5. This figure shows that zip code-level growth in the number of IRS returns
filed in 2007 is not only much greater than in other years, but that 2007 growth covaries
60

Recent work by Amromin and McGranahan (2015) and Amromin, McGranahan, and Schanzenbach
(2015) also uses the Equifax dataset but splits mortgage debt into non–HELOC mortgage debt and HELOCs.
Although these papers do not emphasize the point, they also find broadly similar growth rates of mortgage
balances across the income distribution, even when HELOC balances are excluded.

negatively and monotonically with zip code-level income. As with the choice of income
definition, however, the choice of ending year has little eﬀect on the main results. Figure A.6
shows that using 2007 as the end of the boom for the zip code-level distributions generates
the same patterns seen in earlier figures.

A.3

Individual-Level IRS Data from the Tax Model Files

The analysis in the main text uses publicly available income data from the IRS that has
been aggregated to the zip-code level. However, as noted in the text, the IRS also produces
a public-use sample of anonymized individual-level tax returns, often referred to as the Tax
Model Files. These files are well suited for studying the U.S. income distribution due to their
large sample sizes (samples for recent years include around 150,000 individual tax records) as
well as their excellent coverage of the highest-income tax filers. Recently, Saez and Zucman
(2016) used the Tax Model Files to study changes in the U.S. wealth distribution over time,
by capitalizing flows of reported income and deductions into stocks of wealth and debt.
As part of that study, the authors constructed individual-level estimates of housing assets
by capitalizing property tax payments in a way that forced implied totals to be consistent
with national aggregates. Similarly, mortgage debt was netted out of housing wealth by
capitalizing mortgage-interest deductions.
The Tax Model Files are much larger than the SCF and are available annually rather than
every three years. Even so, the SCF provides better coverage of housing wealth and debt
throughout the whole of the income distribution, in large part because lower-income filers are
less likely to itemize their property-tax and mortgage-interest deductions. For homeowners
who take the standard deduction rather than itemize, there is no way to capitalize their
property-tax and mortgage-interest payments into stocks of housing wealth or mortgage
debt. When the focus is on the stock of wealth at the top of the income distribution, as
in Saez and Zucman (2016), low itemization rates in the middle and bottom of the income
distribution are not a significant concern. But when the focus is on mortgage debt throughout
the income distribution, as in this paper, the lack of housing-related information for the mass
of tax filers is a serious drawback.
For an estimate of how serious this drawback is likely to be, we turn first to Poterba
and Sinai (2008), a paper that assessed the likely incidence of various housing-related tax
provisions for homeowners of varying ages and incomes. As part of that study, the authors
used the NBER TAXSIM federal and state income-tax calculators to estimate how many
homeowners in the 2004 SCF would be better oﬀ taking the standard deduction as opposed to
itemizing their deductions, and thus becoming eligible for tax benefits such as the mortgageinterest deduction. The Poterba-Sinai results are displayed in the first two columns of Table
A.1. The authors found that only 23.4 percent of homeowners with under $40,000 in annual
3

income should itemize their deductions. The predicted itemization rate for homeowners with
$125,000–$250,000 of income was 98.4 percent, while the comparable figure for homeowners
with incomes above $250,000 was 99.9 percent.61 These results imply that Saez and Zucman
(2016) have a near-complete sample of property-tax and mortgage-interest payments at the
top of the income distribution. But applying the capitalization method to the lower parts
of the income distribution would miss many homeowners.
To further illustrate the inverse relationship between income and itemization rates among
homeowners, we make a similar calculation using the IRS zip-code level data. The 2007 data
include information on the number of tax returns in each zip code that reported mortgage
interest payments. Using the Equifax data to estimate the number of households with a
mortgage in each zip code, we can then calculate the fraction of households with a mortgage
who deducted their mortgage interest paid. We do this for five income quintiles of zip codes,
using either average AGI or average salary and wages to construct quintiles. The results
are reported in the remaining columns of Table A.1. Consistent with the predictions of
Poterba and Sinai (2008), we find that a higher fraction of mortgaged households in highincome zip codes deduct mortgage interest payments. Because our calculation is done at
the zip-code and not the household level, our results are not as extreme as those of Poterba
and Sinai (2008). We find that around 45 percent of mortgaged households in the lowestincome quintile itemize their mortgages, compared to nearly 75 percent in the highest-income
quintile.
The Poterba-Sinai calculation implies that 63.1 percent of all homeowners in the 2004
SCF should have itemized their deductions. That figure is quite close to the overall itemization rate of 63.8 percent that we find using the 2007 zip-code level data. Interestingly,
Poterba and Sinai also report that their prediction is close to the fraction of 2004 SCF
homeowners who reported they did in fact itemize on their most-recent return (63.3 percent). However, at a more disaggregated level, Poterba and Sinai find large diﬀerences in
predicted vs. self-reported itemization rates among low- and middle-income homeowners.
Among homeowners making less than $125,000 per year, the self-reported itemization rate
for those headed by individuals younger than 35 was 20 percentage points lower than predicted. For homeowners over 65, the self-reported itemization rate was about 20 percentage
points higher than predicted. For our purposes, the implication of this finding is that it
would be diﬃcult to impute itemization rates among low- and middle-income filers based on
income levels.
Finally, we note that an additional problem with using the capitalization method to
61

The authors define household income as “adjusted gross income plus the following items: income from
nontaxable investments, an estimate of employer contributions for FICA, payments from unemployment
insurance and workers compensation, gross social security income, and any alternative minimum tax (AMT)
preference items that can be estimated from the SCF” (p. 84).

4

estimate individual-level debt levels for low- and middle-income taxpayers is that this method
assumes identical capitalization factors across income groups. When measuring stocks of
wealth, as in Saez and Zucman (2016), the assumption of equal capitalization factors makes
sense. Two individuals holding an identical bond will receive identical interest payments,
even though one individual may be richer than the other. Because the interest rate on the
bond is essentially the inverse of the capitalization factor, the capitalization factor used to
infer stocks of bond holdings from flows of bond interest should therefore be identical across
income groups. However, mortgage interest rates paid by two individuals are likely to diﬀer
with income.62 As a result, assuming an identical capitalization factor to back out stocks
of mortgage debt from flows of mortgage interest is less tenable when households have very
diﬀerent incomes.

A.4

Relationship to Kumhof, Rancière, and Winant (2015)

In a stimulating paper on the potential relationship between income inequality and financial
crises, Kumhof, Rancière, and Winant (2015, henceforth KRW) use the SCF to motivate a
general equilibrium model of lending across income groups. The model is designed to show
how rising income inequality in the 1920s and the latter part of the 20th century could have
contributed to the Great Depression and the Great Recession, respectively. In the model,
households at the top of the income distribution lend to the rest of the population, so
that these borrowers can maintain their consumption levels amid declining relative incomes.
At some point, the lower-income households make a rational decision to default on their
consumption loans, a choice that gives them financial relief but that also triggers a financial
crisis. To motivate the model, the first part of the paper uses SCF data to plot the total
debt-to-income ratio (DTI) of the top 5 percent of households along with that of the bottom
95 percent.63 The DTI of the bottom 95 percent trends up from 1983 through 2007. The
DTI of the richest 5 percent has no discernible trend from 1983 onward, although it does
increase somewhat from 2001 to 2007. The data are thus consistent with a broad prediction
of the KRW model: before the Great Recession, the debt burden of the bottom 95 percent
of households grew relative to the debt burden of the households at the top.
The DTI plot motivates a model of total debt, not mortgage debt, but KRW’s analysis
of debt for diﬀerent income categories has some similarities to ours, so comparison of the
two approaches is informative. As a first step in this comparison, the two left-hand panels
of Figure A.7 plot mortgage debt levels and shares across 20 bins of the income distribution,
rather than the five bins used in Figure 2. The use of 20 rather than five categories allows an
examination of mortgage debt of the richest 5 percent of households, one of the two income

groups in the KRW graph. The additional bins do not change the main message of Figure
2, as debt shares remain relatively stable and the richest categories take out the most debt
in dollar terms. The share of mortgage debt of the very top bin drops somewhat, but the
top 5 percent of households takes out $618 billion in new mortgage debt during the boom,
more than the $554 billion of the bottom 40 percent combined.
Like the income measure featured in the main results of this paper, income in Figure A.7
is defined as salary and wage income, whereas KRW use total income. Table A.2 therefore
presents a series of mortgage-debt and income statistics for the bottom 95 percent and top
5 percent of the total-income distribution. The first two rows of the table emphasize the
disproportionate representation of high-income households in outstanding mortgage debt. By
definition, the top 5 percent of households always account for one-twentieth of all households,
but their share of aggregate mortgage debt was slightly higher than one-fifth when the
mortgage boom began in 2001. The next row shows that in dollar terms, the average
household in the top 5 percent started the boom with an outstanding mortgage-debt balance
of just over $200,000, which rose to just under $350,000 by 2007. In dollar terms, the richest
group accounts for 20 percent of the aggregate dollar-value increase of additional mortgage
debt from 2001 to 2007 (row 4). Because this percentage is slightly below the top group’s
23 percent share of mortgage debt at the start of the boom (row 2), the top group’s share of
aggregate mortgage debt falls—to 21 percent—in 2007. The use of total income rather than
salary and wage income therefore results in a small drop in the share of mortgage debt held
by the top 5 percent, similar to the decline seen using salary and wage income in Figure A.7.
The KRW model studies how the debt burden of the bottom 95 percent aﬀects its incentives to default and thus the health of the financial system, and it measures leverage
using debt-to-income ratios (DTIs). Rows 5 through 8 of Table A.2 characterize the evolution of total household income for the two income categories. The first of these rows shows
that average income of the high-income group is close to $500,000 in 2001, rising to around
$630,000 six years later. The implied rate of income growth is larger than that experienced
by the lower-income group, so the share of income earned by the top 5 percent rises, from 35
percent in 2001 to 37 percent in 2007. Row 7 shows that the mortgage DTI of the bottom 95
percent rises from 0.77 to 1.22, while that of the higher-income group increases from 0.41 to
0.55. Thus, the mortgage data are consistent with a visual implication of KRW’s graph, as
the absolute change in the DTI of the bottom 95 percent is larger than the absolute change
of the top 5 percent from 2001 to 2007. When debt is defined as mortgage debt alone, as in
Table A.2, the absolute increases in DTIs are 0.45 and 0.14, respectively (row 8). Diﬀerences
in absolute DTI in the KRW figure appear even larger than this. This is almost certainly
because the KRW paper plots total DTIs rather than mortgage DTIs, and KRW find that

6

non-mortgage debt rises more quickly for the lower-income group.64
Absolute diﬀerences in DTIs could well be useful for motivating a general equilibrium
model of indebtedness, but they are less informative about changes in the distribution of
mortgage debt with respect to income.65 If income levels of the two groups had not changed
from 2001 to 2007, equal percentage increases in mortgage debt for the two groups would
have generated equal percentage changes in DTIs. However, because the bottom 95 percent
began the boom with a higher DTI than the top 5 percent (0.77 vs. 0.41), equal percentage
changes in debt would have generated a larger absolute change in the DTI of the lower-income
group. Additionally, the faster income growth experienced by the richest group from 2001 to
2007 would have reduced its relative DTI growth in both absolute and relative terms. When
we consider log changes rather than percentage changes, the eﬀects of changes in either debt
or income on DTIs are exact (notwithstanding rounding). Row 9 of Table A.2 shows that
the log changes in the two DTIs are 0.46 and 0.30, which are more similar than the absolute
changes in the previous row. The diﬀerence of 0.16 in the log change is accounted for nearly
equally by somewhat faster debt growth among the lower-income group (row 10) combined
with somewhat slower income growth (row 11).
While our data are consistent with KRW’s plot, we interpret the main reason behind the
overall increase in debt diﬀerently than they do. Flow of Funds data indicate that mortgage
debt grew much more quickly than non-mortgage debt during the early 2000s, so that the
explanation of the overall debt boom during this period must involve mortgages.66 Some
mortgage debt undoubtedly supported consumption, in the spirit of KRW’s model. But
one-fifth of the aggregate mortgage-debt increase was accounted for by the richest 5 percent
of households, a group that averaged nearly a half-million dollars in annual income at the
start of the boom. This fact suggests that borrowing for investment, not consumption, was
the true driver of debt accumulation. Along these lines, the right-most panels of Figure
A.7 show that the disproportionate share of real estate assets held by the top 5 percent
became even larger during the boom. Although these cross-sectional patterns suggest that
investment motives were paramount during the boom, we recognize that a comprehensive
comparison of consumption and investment motives must await future research.
64

See Panel B of KRW’s Figure 3 (p. 1222).
While indebtedness is often measured with DTIs, using DTIs to study the evolution of debt in the
cross-section is similar to using a less-flexible version of the benchmark log-log regression employed in the
main text. The benchmark model regresses the natural log of mortgage debt for a cross-sectional unit on
the log of its income and either a constant or city fixed eﬀects. Working with DTIs constrains the coeﬃcient
that multiplies log income in this regression to equal one.
66
Figure 1 shows that mortgage debt grew much faster than personal disposable income during the early
2000s, but we found in unreported work that non-mortgage debt grew about as fast as income during the
boom.

Debt Distributions Disaggregated by Lien Types

In the text, we investigate debt patterns using all types of mortgage debt: first mortgages,
second mortgages, and HELOCs. Figure A.8 disaggregates the analysis by lien type. For
reference, we include as the upper left panel of this figure the overall debt distribution with
respect to income that appeared as part of Figure 2 in the text. The top right panel of
Figure A.8 shows the distribution of first-mortgage debt. Because the large majority of
outstanding debt consists of first liens, it is not surprising that the first-lien distribution
remains stable over time. The lower left panel presents distributions of closed-end second
mortgages. Here, there is a pronounced change in the distribution, with high-income ZIP
codes receiving much higher shares of second-mortgage debt in 2006 relative to 2001. The
last panel shows distributions of HELOC debt. There is a slight tilt toward higher debt
shares among richer quintiles, but this tilt is not as severe as in the previous panel. In any
case, none of the panels in Figure A.8 indicates a significant increase in the share of debt
held by low-income quintiles. Figure A.9 performs the same analysis using AGI rather than
salaries and wages, with similar results.

A.6

Distributional Statistics for the SCF

The panels in Figure A.10 provide some formal statistics for the SCF distributions in the top
left panel of Figure 4. The top left panel graphs the mean and median debt levels for each
year of the SCF, the top right panel depicts the standard deviation, and the two bottom
panels plot the inter-quartile range and the 90th–10th percentile diﬀerences, respectively.

A.7

Homeownership in the SCF

Figure A.11 depicts income coeﬃcients from a regression of homeownership on income. This
analysis is structured analogously to the mortgageship logits in Figure 7 in the text, and
shows essentially the same patterns.

A.8

Identifying First-Time Mortgageship in Equifax

As mentioned in the main text, Equifax includes a variable that gives the age of the oldest
mortgage on record for each individual. Using this variable, we identify individuals taking
out their first mortgage. However, the information in this variable needs to be cross-verified
with other variables in Equifax before it is usable. We code someone as taking out their first
mortgage if the individual is born in 1950 or later,67 and if the age of her oldest mortgage
67

We limit our analysis to borrowers born in 1950 or later because for borrowers born earlier, it is much
more likely that the first mortgage recorded in Equifax is not actually their first mortgage, because Equifax

8

is zero within one quarter on either end of originating a first-lien mortgage. In other words,
an individual could have a first-mortgage originated in the quarter just prior or just after
Equifax indicates that the age of a first mortgage has gone from “no account on file” to zero.
For the hazard ratios in the main text, we are interested in the probability of an individual
taking out their first mortgage, so we do not correct for joint mortgages. However, in the
data check described in the next paragraph we divide the number of joint mortgages by two.
Figure A.12 plots our estimate of the share of all purchase mortgages going to people
taking out their first mortgage, along with the estimate of the share of all purchase mortgages
going to first-time homeowners from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) Annual
Survey. It should be noted that first-time mortgageship and first-time homeownership are
not necessarily the same: it is possible that someone inherited a home or bought a home
with cash prior to taking out a first-ever mortgage. However, the two should be highly
correlated. Our estimate is calculated using a 10 percent sample from Equifax and HMDA.
The numerator is the number of first-time-ever mortgages originated in Equifax and the
denominator is the number of owner-occupied purchase mortgages in HMDA. In comparison,
NAR is a survey of over 100,000 home buyers with a less than 10 percent response rate, so
their final survey results have under 10,000 home buyers and suﬀer from selection bias. Given
that each of these two measures is imperfect, their similarity is remarkable.

A.9

Gross Flows Analysis without Area-Level Fixed Eﬀects

The two panels of Figure A.13 present the estimated income eﬀects from regressions that have
either total originations (top panel) or total terminations (bottom panel) on the left-hand
side. They are analogous to the right-hand-side panels of Figure 10, which are generated
from regressions that also include CBSA × year fixed eﬀects.

A.10

Eﬀect of Subprime and Alt-A on Debt Growth: 2001–2007

Figure A.14 replicates the main lessons of Figure 15 for debt growth, using 2007 as the ending
year of the mortgage boom. Like Figure 15, which ends the boom in 2006, the appendix
figure shows that the use of subprime mortgages grew more in low-income areas. Growth in
Alt-A and prime mortgage debt tended to be higher in richer ZIP codes. The end result is
that mortgage debt grew at broadly similar rates throughout the income distribution, both
within and across CBSAs.

Alternative Measures of Homeownership

Figure A.15 provides two estimates of the homeownership rate. The red line shows the
standard homeownership rate, which is calculated by the Census Bureau as the share of
occupied housing units that are occupied by owners. This rate is calculated using owneroccupied rates in the Current Population Survey/Housing Vacancy Survey. The blue line
shows an alternative measure of homeownership suggested by Mian and Sufi (2016b), which
is the total number of owner-occupied units divided by the population of adults aged 15 or
older. The latter measure requires an estimate of the total number of owner-occupied units,
which is periodically updated by Census based on changes in methodology or sample frames.
Our estimate adjusts for the break in the estimate of owner-occupied units that occurs in
2000. This adjustment uses information on the total housing inventory in Table 953 of the
2004 Statistical Abstract of the United States.

Figure A.11. Regression Evidence on the Relationship between Homeownership and Income
in the Survey of Consumer Finances. Note: These panels are derived from logit homeownership
regressions with the same right-hand-side variables and sample restrictions as those used for the Poisson
regressions for total debt depicted in the bottom panel of Figure 5 and the SCF mortgageship regressions
in Figure 7. All panels plot the marginal eﬀect of log wage income on the probability of homeownership
for all individuals (top panel) or for specific age groups (lower panels). The lower panels are generated
from a regression in which the income regressor is interacted with dummy variables for the household head’s
age group. All income eﬀects are marginal impacts on the probability of homeownership (not raw logit
coeﬃcients) and are calculated at the means of regressors from the first SCF implicate. Source: Survey of
Consumer Finances.

Figure A.15. Alternative Measures of Homeownwership. Note: The red line shows the standard
homeownership rate, which is the share of occupied housing units that are occupied by owners. The blue
line shows the total number of owner-occupied housing units divided by the population of adults aged 15
or older. The number of owner-occupied units is adjusted for break in 2000 using information on the total
housing inventory in Table 953 of the 2004 Statistical Abstract of the United States. Source: Bureau of the
Census and Bureau of Labor Statistics.
