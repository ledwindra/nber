We construct a business cycle version of a standard sticky price model in which imperfectly competitive firms set nominal prices in a staggered fashion.  We assume that prices are exogenously sticky for a short period of time.  Persistent output fluctuations require endogenous price stickiness in the sense that firms choose not to change prices very much when they can do so.  We find the amount of endogenous stickiness to be small.  As a result, we find that such a model cannot generate persistent movements in output following monetary shocks.\n\n",
