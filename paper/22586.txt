Love, Money, and Parental Goods: Does Parental Matchmaking Matter?
Fali Huang, Ginger Zhe Jin, and Lixin Colin Xu
NBER Working Paper No. 22586
September 2016
JEL No. D82,D83,J12
ABSTRACT
While parental matchmaking has been widespread throughout history and across countries, we
know little about the relationship between parental matchmaking and marriage outcomes. Does
parental involvement in matchmaking help ensure their needs are better taken care of by married
children?This paper finds supportive evidence using a survey of Chinese couples. In particular,
parental involvement in matchmaking is associated with having a more submissive wife, a greater
number of children, a higher likelihood of having any male children, and a stronger belief of the
husband in providing old age support to his parents. These benefits, however, are achieved at the
cost of less marital harmony within the couple and lower market income of the wife. The results
render support to and extend the findings of Becker, Murphy and Spenkuch (2015) where parents
meddle with children's preferences to ensure their commitment to providing parental goods such
as old age support.

1 Introduction
Since the pioneering work of Becker (1973, 1974), marriage formation is often modeled
as a matching process where males and females meet each other randomly or are assisted
by commercial agents (Weiss, 1997).

This approach ignores a unique feature of marriage

matching: marriage is not simply of two individuals forming a new family; rather, it directly
aects the welfare of their parents.
Many goods produced by the couple  including their labor market income, household
goods and services, children, and old age support  can be sharable and benecial to parents.
Old age support is a prominent example.

Throughout history and in many developing

countries today, old age support depends critically on children (e.g., Cheung, 1972; Davidson
and Ekelund, 1997; Anderson, 2003). How can parents ensure that old age support will be
provided by children after they grow up? In traditional China, such provision was ensured by
parental

ownership of children and the cultivation of lial piety (i.e., children submissiveness

to parents) (Cheung, 1972).

In the modern world, Becker, Murphy and Spenkuch (2015)

(BMS 2015 hereafter) argue that, when old age support is mainly provided by adult children,
parents will put in resources to meddle with children's preferences and make them more
altruistic towards parents.
In this paper we show that, by having a say at the stage of spouse searching, parents may
be able to get a favorable provision of old age support and other parental goods from their
children. This is achieved by nudging the potential spouse choice towards what the parents
prefer in light of parental goods to be provided by the couple.
Parental goods refer to market or household goods and services directly consumed by
parents, either through household public goods or direct expenditure on parents. For example, married children with high labor market incomes may give parents high income transfer
in various forms. Alternatively, children with a low market income may spend more time
providing household-produced goods and services (including companionship).

A pleasant

personality of the spouse often becomes crucial in providing essential emotional and social
support for old parents. The presence of a large number of grandchildren may also be considered as an essential contribution of adult children to parental goods, and in particular,
having at least one male grandchild can oer extra boost to their satisfaction. As put by

2

Mencius, a key Chinese philosopher from 372-289 B.C., of the three deeds disrespectful to
parents, the worst is to bear no children.
Parental goods enter the utility function dierently from the indirect component of the
utility through parental altruism towards children. For example, altruistic parents may derive
utility from having a happily married adult child, but the emotional attraction within the
couple is not a parental good. Indeed, parental matchmaking may involve a trade-o between
children's welfare and parental goods. In particular, parents who help in matchmaking expect
to have a long-term relationship with the couple, and these future interactions may distort
the incentive of matchmaking and, therefore, aect the matching outcomes.
Consider a son who chooses between self and parental match-making. His satisfaction
with his spouse depends on expected marriage outcomes, including the couple's joint income,
household production, and love. In contrast, parents obtain a spillover from the couple's market and household production, and being altruistic, they also obtain an altruistic component
originating from the son's welfare from the marriage.
Conict of interest arises from the parents' keen interest in the couple's market and
household production.

Parents who expect to receive parental goods from their son after

his marriage may care less about how attractive his wife is to him and how harmonious
the couple's married life will be, but more about how able she is in contributing to family
wealth, ospring, old age support and other household production (Cheung, 1972). Parents
may also care more about the compatibility of the daughter-in-law's preference with their
needs, and therefore weigh their harmony with the daughter-in-law more heavily than the
harmony between the future couple.

As a result, the best wife candidate in the eyes of

parents probably diers from what is optimal to the son, even though parents are altruistic
and care about the son's welfare. Thus, parental matchmaking carries an agency cost for
the son, but it is benecial for parental welfare.
Without search costs, the son would prefer self search to avoid the agency cost in parental
matchmaking. However, parents and children dier in search costs. On the one hand, parents
may face higher search costs for love within the potential couple than the son. On the other
hand, parents can have a wide access to potential candidates via their own social networks.
Parental search can be a greater advantage if parents are better at judging the candidate's
character and earning ability.

Thus, despite the agency costs of parental matching, it is

sometimes optimal for the son to choose parental matchmaking because of the saving in
search costs.
We incorporate both agency costs and search costs into a theoretical framework, and
derive several testable implications.

First, love in a marriage should be lower for parent-

involved matches than for self-matches. This is because parents value more than their son

3

the monetary and household production components of his marriage, and they have a higher
marginal cost in assessing love within the couple. Due to the agency cost, the overall marriage
gain to the son, measured by love, income and household production but excluding search
cost, would be lower under parent-involved matches than self matches. However, the sharable
part of the marriage outcome could be lower or higher under parental matchmaking. It could
be higher because parents put more emphasis on sharable market and household production
than on love, and the wife who is picked by parents therefore tends to have a higher ability
to contribute to the sharable productions.

It could be lower when parents overemphasize

goods produced within the household and the preservation of the old social structure at the
expense of market productivity. In this case, the couple's market income may be lower in
parent-involved matches, but key elements for household production such as the number of
children, willingness to provide old age support, and the submissiveness of the wife would
increase.
We take these predictions to a sample of 6,334 couples in 1991 from seven Chinese
provinces.

In the sample, 48% of rural couples and 14.5% of urban couples were mar-

ried by parent-involved matchmaking; the rest by either self search or friend introduction
(both of which are referred to as self match). Comparison across parental and self matching
largely supports our theoretical predictions.

In the full sample, parent-involved matches

yield lower marital harmony and lower couple income, but parent matches are more likely to
have submissive wives, less labor market participation of wives, lower wife income, a greater
number of children, a higher likelihood of having a boy, and a stronger belief of the husband
in providing old age support to his parents. In particular, when we allow parental matchmaking to have dierent eects on couple incomes across urban and rural areas, its eect is
positive for urban couples (as in Huang et al., 2012) but negative for rural couples. Many
household outcomes examined in this paper  fertility, old age support, and wife submissiveness  are more important in rural than urban areas, because rural areas have fewer job
market opportunities, provide less social support for the elderly, oer less market provision
for services, and hold stronger beliefs on traditional family values.

So rural parents may

emphasize women's contribution within the household more than market earnings.
Our work extends BMS (2015) in a few ways. BMS (2015) suggests that parents have
incentives to meddle with children's preferences in order to ensure their commitment to
providing old age support.

Instead of using human capital investment as a tool to make

children more altruistic, we argue that parents can exert their inuence even after the son
has grown up by actively involving in the searching process and the nal selection of the
potential daughter-in-law. In this sense, we take the son's schooling as predetermined while
focus on parents' incentive in matchmaking.

4

Moreover, we extend parental consideration

from old age support to all sorts of parental goods that could be benecial to parents.
Because dierent parental goods may require dierent traits of the daughter-in-law, it is an
interesting empirical question to assess how parental preference and the social environment
that shapes this preference aect parental involvement in matchmaking.
In addition to extending BMS (2015) and Huang et al. (2012), this paper contributes
to the marriage literature by highlighting the economic trade-os in parental matchmaking.
Unlike the classical focus on the eects of sex ratio (Angrist, 2002), divorce law (Chiappori,
2002), or educational composition on marriage outcomes, we show that the institutional

1

details of how the match is accomplished in the rst place also have important implications.

In a related paper, Edlund and Lagerlof (2006) show that the shift from parental to individual
consent in marriage allows the young couple, instead of their parents, to receive the bride
price and thus facilitates economic growth. We dier in that our focus is not on who controls
nancial resources in a marriage, but on who has more inuence on the the choice of spouse.
The trade-o between love and money has also been explored by Fernandez et al. (2005), but
their perspective is of marriage sorting on skills and its relationship with income inequality;

2 Our paper is also related to Cheung (1972),
3
who argues that many traditional Chinese family practices, including marriage patterns,

they do not discuss matchmaking methods.

are shaped by parental considerations to maximize family wealth, and that lial piety is
an endogenous belief that is conducive to the purpose of family wealth maximization. That
paper does not focus on the eect of matchmaking methods; neither does it oer econometric
evidence. Finally, our paper is related to the literature of inter-generational relationship and
old age support. Researchers have explored how inter-generational relationships aect old
age support (see, for instance, Ikkink, Tilburg and Knipscheer, 1999; Ho, 2007). However,
none has explored the role that matchmaking methods play in facilitating old age support.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Section 2 describes the theoretical in-

sights, Section 3 summarizes the data, and Section 4 presents the empirical results. A brief
conclusion is oered in Section 5.

2 Theoretical Framework and Empirical Identication
In this section, we rst present an agency model of parental matchmaking and then interpret it in the context of parental goods. The last subsection discusses empirical implications

Chiappori et al. (2002), Suen, Chan and Zhang (2003), and Huang et al. (2009).

and Zimmer and Kwong (2003), none of which examines how parental matchmaking aects marriage outcomes and how considerations of old age support aect these eects.

and how we plan to test them with data.

2.1

Agency model of parental matching

Consider the marital decision of a young man, who has nished schooling and started working
to earn a living. The search process for a potential wife can either be conducted directly
by his parents or by himself. The process that yields a higher net expected utility to him
will be implemented. This setup is meant to capture the current practice in China, where
marriage in general cannot be forced upon a child by parents, and males are usually the ones

4

who initiate and propose marriage.

2.1.1 Basic Set up
An individual's benet from marriage can be categorized into two dimensions: one is the
economic gain from joint household production and the other is emotional support from the
spouse. The total benet is aected not only by the characteristics of husband and wife, but
also by their matching quality.
Let

hm ≥ 0 denote the young man's human capital level, which aects his earning and his

intra-household productivity. The human capital may capture, for example, his character,
innate ability, years of schooling, communication skills, and so on.

which reects both the couple's household production output and

joint income earned from markets. We assume

f (0, 0) > 0, fi > 0, fij > 0,

and

fii ≤ 0

for

i, j ∈ {1, 2}.
Another key element in marriage is match quality, denoted by

α

which is idiosyncratic

to the couple and not readily observed by others; it can be interpreted as love or attraction
between two persons, which is often unpredictable based on commonly observed characteristics. This implies that

α can be treated as uncorrelated with hf .

Given our assumption that

marriage is always implemented with mutual consent by the young couple, the emotional
output of marriage can be normalized as positive and

4 In modern China where our data are from, the son's consent is necessary for parents to be involved in
wife searching and parents can no longer force the son to accept their choice of daughter in law. The relevant
evidence from the data is discussed in Section 3.2. Having said that, modeling matchmaking means as the
choice of the son or the choice of his parents will yield the same qualitative results. A similar model can also
be used to study the search process of a young woman.

5 This assumption is for simplicity only, as the same results can be derived for the case with

6

α ≤ 0.

The parents' gain from their son being married to a wife with characteristics
contains two parts: one is the public good component

f (hf , hm )

(α, hf )

also

that generates a utility of

γ · f (hf , hm ), which corresponds to all sorts of parental goods; the other is the altruistic
component δ(β + α)f (hf , hm ) because they care about the welfare of their son, where γ > 0
and δ ∈ (0, 1). Since the love α between the husband and wife is by denition consumed
privately by the couple themselves, it does not aect the parents' welfare directly. The wife's
characteristics that may aect the whole family, such as pleasant personality and beauty,
are already indicated by the wife's human capital

hf ,

which as mentioned earlier is broadly

6
dened and not restricted to formal schooling.
Marital search is costly. If searching himself, the son has to bear the search cost, which
is

ηm c(α, hf , hm ) > 0,

costly for a man with a

hf ) to become his wife, and the search cost for a wife of a given quality is lower
if the man's hm is higher. The parameter ηm denotes the eect of some common elements on

on idiosyncratic conditions of searching.
If the marriage is through parental search, parents will bear the search cost, which depends on how intelligent they are in assessing

α and how well they are connected with relevant

social networks that have access to potential candidates. The parents' degree of competence

the parameter

ηp s(α, hf , hp ) > 0, where
ηp denotes some common

factor that aects the cost of searching by all parents. To capture the idea that the match
quality

α

is couple idiosyncratic, we assume that, in order to achieve the same level of

α,

the parents' search cost cannot be too low compared with the direct search by their son, i.e.,

ηp s1 ≥ δηm c1

for any given

hm , hf ,

and

hp .

A few comments on the model assumptions are in order.

We assume the emotional

component of marital output (α) enters multiplicatively with the total output of the couple
(f (hf , hm )), in order to capture the possibility that marital harmony may aect the productivity of highly educated individuals to a greater extent, as creativity and precision in
job performance are relatively more easily reduced by emotional disturbances than manual
labor. In this sense, the emotional component and human capital are complements, which
is similar to a pattern in the business world where matching quality matters more for rms
with high-skilled working environment. The multiplicative assumption is not essential to our
main results; we have double checked the alternative setup where they are additive, and all

6 Parents may have other gains from doing matchmaking than the elements already shown in the model;
as long as these concerns are not identical with those of their children, our main results should hold.

7

predictions go through. If we do not adopt the multiplicative assumption, the assumption

c31 < 0 becomes essential to the sorting result presented below.

In other words,

c31 < 0 holds

if highly educated people have a greater social circle and hence more opportunities to meet
a potential spouse, or if they also have better capabilities to convince the spouse candidate
to marry them eventually. So even though their salary and hence opportunity cost per hour
is high, the fact that they may spend much less time in wooing the potential spouse is likely
to reduce their overall searching cost. For example, the potential cost for a Forrest Gump to
convince an attractive woman to marry him can be much higher than that for a Bill Gates.
In short, for the model to carry through, we need either the multiplicative assumption or
the assumption of

c31

being negative, but not necessarily both.

Another key assumption lies in the non-transferability of search cost. The cost in nding a
potential spouse, though containing a monetary and material component that is transferable,
has a substantial part that is dicult to transfer between parents and children. For example,
one often gets to know a potential spouse through social gatherings and events, and this
means that the son or the parents have to participate themselves by spending time, eort,
and other expenditure that are not easily transferable. And usually such social occasions are
organized around their own social networks such as friends and coworkers, which are simply
not accessible by others in the family. The time, eort, and gifts required in maintaining
ongoing social networks and events are not easily transferable.

If the son conducts the

search himself, he has to spend his own eort and incur expenditures that can't simply be
compensated by his parents. Similarly, if parents conduct the search, they will rely on their
friends and relatives with whom the son may not be familiar. The model captures this nontransferable part while leaving the transferable part as a common component that will drop
out in search cost comparison.

2.1.2 The Son's Optimal Choice of Search Methods
The son decides whether to search for his marriage partner himself or to delegate the search
to his parents. If he searches himself, his objective function is

U ∗ ≡ max(β + α)f (hf , hm ) − ηm c(α, hf , hm ).
α,hf

The corresponding optimal choices of his potential wife's characteristics that result from
searching by himself are denoted by

α∗

and

h∗f , which are characterized by the following rst

order conditions

f (h∗f , hm ) − ηm c1 (α∗ , h∗f , hm ) = 0,
8

(1)

(β + α∗ )f1 (h∗f , hm ) − ηm c2 (α∗ , h∗f , hm ) = 0.

(2)

If his parents manage the search, their objective function is

e ≡ max[γ + δ(β + α)]f (hf , hm ) − ηp s(α, hf , hp ),
U
α,hf

where the corresponding optimal choices are denoted by
tions that characterize

α

and

h∗∗

The necessary condi-

(3)

∗∗
∗∗
[γ + δ(β + α∗∗ )]f1 (h∗∗
f , hm ) − ηp s2 (α , hf , hp ) = 0.

(4)

It is easy to see that in general the optimal wives are dierent between these two search
processes.
Then the son's choice problem is

max{U ∗ ; U ∗∗ },

where

U ∗ ≡ (β + α∗ )f (h∗f , hm ) − ηm c(α∗ , h∗f , hm ); U ∗∗ ≡ (β + α∗∗ )f (h∗∗
f , hm ),

and the second term is the son's net utility when his parents do the search for him. Searching
by himself will prevail if
opposite

U ∗ < U ∗∗

U ∗ ≥ U ∗∗ , while his parents will be delegated to do the search if the

is true.

7 The main implications of the optimal solution to this problem

are summarized by the following propositions (see Appendix A for proof ):

These propositions suggest that the eects of parental involvement in marriage search can
be dierent for the two dimensions of marriage output: it is always negative for the emotional
output, which is driven by the fact that the matching quality  love

α

 is idiosyncratic to

the couple and thus not easily observed or shared by others; the eect on the sharable
output, however, can be either negative or positive. The reason for a positive eect is that
the household output can be shared among family members and thus parents have more
incentives to care about the potential wife's human capital.

On the other hand, parental

involvement could have a negative eect on the economic output and is still an optimal
choice from the son's perspective if parental matchmaking leads to substantial savings in
search cost.
Propositions 1-3 also suggest that parental involvement in marital search is endogenous
to individual attributes. It is more likely to happen when the son's human capital level
is lower or the searching cost
goods (when

γ

ηm

hm

is higher, or when his parents benet more from parental

is higher) and have lower searching costs (when

hp

is higher and

ηp

is lower).

In other words, in a given marriage market, there are two sources of self-selection in the
choice of marital search methods: one is from the son and the other is from the parents;
a young man with a lower human capital, or with parents that are more capable or more
motivated is more likely to rely on parental search.
Figure 1 illustrates the positive relationship between

h#

and

h#
p

and how their combina-

tion aects the endogenous choice of marital searching methods. In the graph, a young man
with human capital

for example, will optimally choose to

rely on his parents to search for a potential wife because his human capital is lower than

This choice can also be

2.2

Parental Goods Concerns In Spouse Selection

The above agency model is based on the child's perspective, that is, it is his decision to
choose self search or parental search. In this subsection, we interpret the model from the
parents' perspective, especially in light of the parental goods they expect to obtain from the
son's marriage.
In the scenario where the son entrusts the parents to do the marital search for him,
what would be the parents' deliberations? Since parental goods may include both nancial

10

support and various non-nancial home services from the married couple, attributes that
can contribute to these production abilities, for example schooling for labor income and
submissiveness for home services, will be favored under parental matchmaking.

Parental

deliberations become complicated if dierent types of parental goods require conicting
traits of the daughter-in-law. For example, bearing more children and doing more household
chores often require the daughter-in-law to devote less time and eort to her career outside
home.

This trade-o is especially pronounced if the market is not developed well enough

to provide household services at an aordable price.

In that situation, which applies to

many rural or economically less developed urban areas in China, parents may prefer a homeoriented, submissive daughter-in-law to someone else who is highly educated and careerdriven.

Conversely, in large cities, the market may oer women more job opportunities

and allow them to use labor market income to purchase food preparation, child care, and
old age support from the market.

The substitutability between labor market income and

household service could induce parents to prefer a daughter-in-law with labor market skills
at the expense of domesticity.
Fertility choice entails a special note. Though China has adopted the one-child policy
since early 1980s, enforcement has been looser in rural areas. One reason is that rural labor
is an important input for agricultural production, and without access to pension and health
insurance, having a greater number of children is an important way to ensure old age support.
Having at least one boy is especially important because a woman usually moves out of her
own home and marries into her husband's family (Cheung, 1972). Even if the couple live on
their own, they often live closer to the husband's parents, which explains why it is often the
husband's parents who nance and build a new home for the newly wed couple. Traditional
family values also require the couple to produce household services for the husband's parents
and raise ospring who carry the husband's last name. For the same reason, traditionally
only sons can inherit parents' property (Cheung, 1972). This tradition has faded away in
large cities, but it still persists in rural and less developed areas. Furthermore, enforcing the
one-child policy is more dicult in rural areas: while urban employers, especially state-owned
enterprises and government units, can credibly threaten to demote, ne, or even re those
who attempt to have more than one child, such threats are not credible in rural areas. Thus,
urban residents have little choice in the number or gender of children, but rural residents, if
they want, can have more children than urban couples.
In short, in rural and less developed areas, the lack of government support for the elderly,
the missing market for household services, and traditional family values will all motivate
parents to demand a daughter-in-law who is more home-oriented and willing to raise at least
one boy. In contrast, with less freedom in fertility, parents in more developed urban areas may

11

resort to other means to ensure parental goods from their children, for example, aiming for
higher education and higher couple income, even if that means less adherence to traditional

8 We thus expect more parental matchmaking in rural and less-developed areas, and

values.

such parental matchmaking should have a positive eect on the number of children, the
likelihood of having at least one boy, and the submissiveness of the daughter-in-law.
Tying back to our theoretical model, a greater reliance on adult children for parental
goods can be interpreted as parents putting more weight on the couple's sharable production relative to the son's welfare (i.e.

higher

γ ).

This implies greater agency cost under

parental matching, as the wife candidates ltered by parents will demonstrate more at-

∗∗
tributes preferable by the parents for their consumption of parental goods (∂hf /∂γ

> 0

mathematically).
If there are multiple parental goods and some parental goods are more crucially dependent
on the couple than on the market, we can extend the model to include two sets of couple
output (e.g.

f1 (hf , hm )

for children and household service and

f2 (hf , hm )

for labor market

income) and allow parents to put more weight on one set than the other (e.g.

γ1 > γ2 ).

In

that case, parents will be more eager to look for a daughter-in-law who has favorable traits
to deliver

f1

even if that implies less

f2 .

So far we assume that the son cares only about his own welfare while parents are altruistic,
following the standard assumption in Becker's Rotten Kids Theorem (Becker, 1981). BMS
(2015) argue that parents have incentives to manipulate the son's preference when he was
young so that he is more altruistic towards the parents' old age support when he grows
up.

This is consistent with the traditional values of Chinese families such as lial piety,

which emphasizes that it is the son's duty to continue the surname by having children
(especially boys), to be submissive to parents in general, and to take care of parents when
they are old (Cheung, 1972). If the son's altruism is incorporated into our model, the son's
preference will be more aligned with the parent's preference (e.g. allow

β

to increase with

γ ).

Not only does this reduce the agency cost of parental matchmaking (thus leading to more
parental matchmaking), but it also encourages the son to choose a wife closer to the parents'
preferences even if he decides to search by himself. BMS (2015) thus recongure the forces

8 There are other factors to consider when discussing the eect of parental matchmaking on the number
of children. Parents may view too many children as competition for the limited resources that the couple
have. In other words, what grandchildren have, the grandparents have not. On the other hand, grandparents
tend to enjoy the companion and even household production from grandchildren (e.g., fetching water where
there is no indoor water), and this would result in a positive relationship between parental matchmaking
and the number of children for the couple. The overall eect of parental matchmaking on the number of
children may therefore be ambiguous. However, since children are less costly to raise in rural areas due to
inter-generational cohabitation, the competition eect should be weaker in rural areas, again pushing for a
more positive and pronounced relationship between parental matchmaking and the number of children in
rural areas.

12

underlying the costs and benets of parental matchmaking so that the benets now loom
larger, and parents' demand for certain traits  say, submissiveness of the daughter-in-law
and her willingness to raise at least one boy  is more likely to win out in the end. It also
renders the son more willing to delegate the search to parents. However, allowing the parents
to instill in their son an altruistic feeling towards them only mitigates the agency cost in
parental matchmaking; as long as there is a wedge between the son and his parents' utility
functions, our main results hold.

2.3

Identication Issues

We have argued that some conict of interest may arise between parents and son because
parents rely on their married son for sharable household production, but love is largely
private consumption within the couple.

9 This conict of interest, combined with search cost

in the marriage market, leads to an interesting relationship among parental matchmaking,
husband's belief about old age support, wife characteristics, and marriage outcomes such
as love, joint couple income, wife's labor participation status, and the number of children.
The main insight is that parents involved in matchmaking prefer a wife good at providing
sharable production, even if such preferences lead to less love within the couple. However,
a challenge to the test of this prediction is the son's endogenous choice of the matchmaking
method.

In particular, the choice of search method may not only be aected by random

elements, but also by the son's and his parents' characteristics as reected by the adverse
and positive selection problems in the above propositions.
If we can perfectly control parents' characteristics

(hp , γ), then the average marital quality

of husbands with parental involvement must be lower than others even when their wives are
of the same quality because the husbands in the parent-matched group have lower human
capital (hm

< h#
m ); this is the adverse selection eect of sons.

In contrast, when the husband's

characteristics are fully controlled, those with parental involvement must have had more
competent parents (hp

> h#
p )

with respect to searching, which implies that their wife's

overall quality, especially their human capital level

h∗∗
f ,

may be higher than others', and

hence their marital quality may also be higher; this is the positive selection eect of parents.
Thus, without properly accounting for these two sources of the endogeneity problem, the
OLS estimated coecient of parental matchmaking can be either higher or lower than the
true eect, depending on which selection issue is dominant.
Our approach to address this challenge is to use instrumental variables that aect the

9 That love is a private good is nicely illustrated by an episode of Seinfeld. Jerry and Elaine, once lovers
and then friends for a long time, became lovers again.

Kramer, Jerry's old friend and neighbor, blurts out, I liked you two so much more when you were friends!

choice of search method but not wife characteristics and marital outcomes directly. The rst
instrument derives from social norms.

Consider two identical marriage markets A and B

that are mutually exclusive. Due to some exogenous shocks, the threshold level of the son's

h#
m , a function of parents' characteristics hp , shifts down in market A but not
in B. This can be achieved in the model, for example, by a lower ηm , which aects the search

human capital

costs of

all individuals in a marriage market.

As shown in Figure 1, this downward shift

in market A will induce a group of young men who are between the new and old threshold
curves to change their search method from parental involvement to self search. As a result,
identical individuals make dierent choices: those in market B have parental involvement,
while those in market A adopt self-search. Comparing their dierence in wife characteristics
and marital outcomes will lter out the endogeneity in the choice of search method driven
by the son or the parents' individual characteristics.
Empirically, for a husband born in year

t,

we construct the instrument for his choice of

parental matchmaking as the percent of other husbands of similar ages in the same market
who chose parental matchmaking. Here we dene a market by the interaction of province
dummy and rural dummy. A similar age cohort is dened as those born in the same year or
one to three years earlier. Admittedly, this market-level instrument may capture local culture
and tradition that aect people's choice of spouse and style of married life. Unfortunately,
such culture and tradition evolve slowly, so that the main variations in our instrumental
variable are cross-sectional.

This implies that we cannot include provincial xed eects

without swamping the power of instrument, but we do control for average income and average
schooling at the district level in urban areas and the township level in rural areas.

10 In this

sense, our instrument is good at ltering out individual-level selections as articulated in the
above propositions, but it may pick up unobserved local culture and tradition independent
of average income or schooling in local city/township.
In particular, we estimate the following specication:

Yim = α0 + β1 · P arentM atchedim + β2 · Zim + β3 · Zm + i
m, Yim denotes marital outcomes, wife characteristics, and
husband i's belief in old age support; Zim denotes husband's observable characteristics such as
age, religion, schooling, party membership, and parents' schooling; Zm denotes whether m is
rural and the average income and schooling at district/township level; and P arentM atchedim
is a dummy variable indicating whether i's parents were involved in the search for his wife.
The instrument that captures the norm of parental matchmaking in market m is denoted as
where for husband

P arentM atchedm .
While P arentM atchedm

lters out individual-level unobservable attributes, it also intro-

duces a general equilibrium problem, that is, the eect of

P arentM atchedm on one individual

may be oset by that on another individual in the same marriage market so that the eect of
the norm may reect spurious correlation due to the omission of other market-level variables.
Take wife schooling as an example. Let us assume that every girl has completed her schooling before entering the marriage market and every girl is eventually married. If we compare
two marriage markets with exactly the same distribution of girl schooling, then the average
wife schooling must be equal regardless of which market uses more parental matchmaking.
A shift in

average.

In reality, the market with a higher

P arentM atchedm

may be associated with

lower average wife schooling for other reasons, for example, such a market may also have an
unobserved culture to discourage girl schooling. In this situation, using

P arentM atchedm

as an instrument may pick up this unobserved culture but does not support the argument
that parents prefer a less educated daughter-in-law.
To address the potential general equilibrium problem, we need individual-level variations
in the instrument. One solution is interacting the market-wide social norm (P arentM atchedm )
with some individual-level variable, say husband schooling (hm ). According to our model,
although social norm does not aect the average wife schooling based on a predetermined
wife schooling distribution, it does aect the assortative matching between husband schooling and wife schooling.

P arentM atchedm alone captures some unobusing P arentM atchedm · him as instruments for

Therefore, even if

served cultural factor beyond our model,

P arentM atchedim ·him will shed light on the eect of parental matchmaking on the matching
pattern of husband and wife schooling.
Again partly to address the general equilibrium problem, our second main instrument is
a pure individual-level instrument based on the characteristics of the husband's rst job.

11

Since the vast majority of husbands should have obtained their rst jobs before dating, the
nature of the rst job may aect the husband's own social circle and therefore his search
cost before marriage, but it should not aect the couple's marriage outcomes directly at
the time of survey after we control for the husband's

current

job status.

12 Empirically, we

dene a dummy for whether an urban husband's rst job was in a state-owned enterprise
and another dummy for whether a rural husband's rst job was in a township and village
enterprise.

Both dummies are referred to as

Job0 .

In the empirical section, we provide a

regressions, the coecients on the rst job variables are not statistically signicant.

number of tests for the validity and power of

and

P arentM atchedm

as instruments.

It is worth noting that the general equilibrium concern is more severe for wife schooling
than for other marriage outcomes, as most girls have completed education before marriage,
and hence the distribution of wife schooling is largely pre-determined.

In contrast, joint

couple income, wife's labor participation, wife submissiveness, fertility outcome, or even the
husband's belief in old age support can be inuenced by parental preference after marriage,
and their average may therefore dier from one market to another even if all markets start
with the same distribution of wife characteristics. In other words, social norm (as proxied by

P arentM atchedm )

could have a causal eect on these other marriage outcomes according

to our theoretical model, even if its identication relies on cross-market comparison.

3 Data and Measurements
3.1

Data Source

We use the Study of the Status of Contemporary Chinese Women (SSCCW), a data-set collected jointly by the Population Institute of Chinese Academy of Social Science and the Population Council of United Nations in 1991 (Institute of Population Studies, 1993). SSCCW
collects information on personal traits, marriage characteristics, fertility, work, intra-family
arrangements, and gender norms.

The survey used stratied random sampling to select

households from one municipality (Shanghai) and 6 provinces (Guangdong, Sichuan, Jilin,
Shandong, Shanxi, and Ningxia) scattered across China in the southeast, south, southwest,
northeast, east, middle and north, respectively. As migration across dierent provinces was
not common in China by 1991, each province can be regarded as a separate marriage market.
Another important dimension that cuts across areas is the urban-rural distinction. The rigid
Hukou system eectively blocked people from migrating between cities and the countryside
at the time of the survey. Furthermore, although our data consist of married couples only,
we do not face much selection in divorce. The divorce rate around our sample period was
only 0.71 per 1000 couples, far below the corresponding numbers in many countries in 1995,
which are 4.44 in the U.S. and 1.59 in Japan (Zeng and Wu, 2000).
SSCCW interviewed husbands and wives separately. Here we focus on the male sample
because a Chinese couple tends to live with the husband's parents by tradition (if they live
with any parent at all), and the paternal parents therefore have stronger incentives to value
a marriage candidate's ability in economic and home production. Our sample thus consists
of husbands. Wife characteristics will be examined as dependent variables, as they are the
result of the choice of the husband (and his parents if they were involved in the search

16

process).

3.2

Key Variables

The question on matchmaking methods asked how an individual met his or her spouse
initially. There are four original categories in the data: introduced by parents or relatives, by
friends, by themselves, and by other means. We dene a dummy of

P arentM atched

equal

to one if the husband has been matched by the introduction of parents or relatives and 0 if
otherwise. We cannot distinguish parents from relatives partly because the distinction is not
available in the data, partly because relatives are an integrated part of the parents' social
networks to facilitate the search process. A perhaps more debatable decision is that we do not
dierentiate couples initially introduced by friends from those who met by themselves. The
reason is that these two groups are similar: in both cases, it is the young people themselves,
not their parents, who conducted the search process and bore the search cost. And indeed,
our empirical explorations suggest that these two groups are very similar.
The survey also asked whether the marriage decision was made by self or parents. Subjects were asked to choose from self decision, parental consent, self decision, parental
disapproval, self decision, parental consent on both sides, self decision, parental disapproval on both sides, parental decision, self indierent, parental decision, self consent and
parental decision, self consent by force. Answer to this question diers greatly by whether

P arentM atched

is equal to one. For the sample of husbands, 33.8% of them had parental

matchmaking. Among those parent-matched marriages, 26.6% were parental decision rather
than self decision. In comparison, only 6.9% of self matched marriages were parental decision. But most parent-decided marriages have the answers of either I consented (78%) or
I was indierent to self decision or parent decision (18.6%). Only 3.4% of them fall in the
category of it was parental decision, and I was forced to agree. This is consistent with our
model assumption that parents cannot force a marriage on an adult son in modern China.
Rural parents play a more important role in their children's marriage life than urban parents,
as reected in our data: 48% of our rural couples were married via parental matchmaking,
while this percentage is only 14.5% for urban couples. Moreover, 30.5% of parent-matched
husbands had their marriage decided by their parents in rural areas, as compared to 13.8%
in urban areas.
From a husband's perspective, marriage outcomes are represented by love, joint income,
non-marketable household production, wife traits, the number and gender composition of
children.

Given the diculty to quantify love, we follow Huang, Jin and Xu (2012) to

proxy the emotional dimension of marriage by an indicator of harmony within a couple.

17

The survey question most closely related to the emotional aspect of marriage asked: "How
do you usually reconcile with your spouse when you have conicts?" We dene a harmony
index as follows: it is equal to 2 if the couple reported no conicts, 1 if conicts are usually
solved by mutual compromise, and 0 if conicts are solved by either unilateral compromise
or third-party mediation by family members, relatives or friends. Third-party involvement
in conict solution is a rare event in the data (only 3% reported so) so we do not distinguish
it from unilateral compromise. The implication is that "no conicts" is the best outcome,
while "mutual compromise" comes next in the ranking, which is arguably less costly or
more eective than unilateral compromise and third-party mediation. Mutual compromise
is better than unilateral compromise also because constant reliance on unilateral compromise
eventually leads to resentment and the loss of love. In our view, this harmony index captures
the essential meaning of a couple's matching quality: couples with better matching quality
are less likely to have conicts and more capable of solving conicts in an eective way.
Though imperfect, the above-mentioned harmony index is a more appropriate measure of
the emotional output of marriage in our context than others used in the literature. In modern
western societies, for example, whether a marriage ends up in divorce is a natural measure
of marital quality.

The extremely low divorce rate in China by 1991, along with the fact

that our data cover married couples only, however, renders this measure less useful.
Joint couple income is measured by the summation of the annual incomes of the husband
and of the wife. This is a measure for the market component of marriage gains. Keep in
mind that maximized couple income could be achieved either by both working for market
incomes or by specialization, that is, one works for the market while the other specializes in
household production.
Wife's labor participation status (at the time of survey) is dened separately for urban
and rural areas. In urban areas, there is an explicit question on whether the wife has any
job outside home. In rural areas, one question asked about a rural wife's main labor type:
household chores, agriculture, household husbandry, household processing, household craft,
individual peddler, township and village enterprises, and other. However, household chores
can entail a large account of income, as high as 3,000 yuan per year at the 95% percentile
and 11,700 yuan at the maximum. Thus we suspect some respondents have included some
market-oriented activities in household chores. To be safe, we classify whether a rural wife
was working in the labor market based on whether her annual income is above 1,500 yuan.
This denition is very much correlated with the reported labor type: for those who reported
household chores as the main labor type, 35% is labeled work by our 1500-yuan denition;
in contrast, of those who reported anything other than household chores as the main labor
type, 67% is labeled work by our denition. Later on we have also used above-1000 yuan

18

as an alternative denition for rural wife's labor participation status and nd robust results.
A signicant share of residents, especially the rural ones, rely on adult children for old
age support.
grow old?

On the question of what do you expect to get from your son when you
4.6% of urban husbands answered nancial support, 43.5% answered home

services, 38.2% answered emotional support, and 13.2% answered that they expected nothing.
In comparison, 19.8% of rural husbands expected nancial support from their sons, 67%
expected home services, 9.1% expected emotional support, and only 3.8% reported that
they expected nothing. Similar patterns occur on a parallel question of what do you expect
to get from your daughter when you are old? but both urban and rural husbands expected
more emotional support from their daughters (41.5% in urban and 29.8% in rural), and
less nancial support (2.4% urban, 11.5% rural) than from sons. On home services, urban
husbands expected about same home services from daughters (44%) as from sons (43.5%),
while rural husbands expected less home services from daughters (51.4%) than from sons
(67%).
Consistent with our discussion that wives are key for providing various home services
including services related to old age support, we nd that wives are likely to contribute
more to old age support than husbands inside the household. The SSCC survey asked urban
husbands and wives separately on who is the main provider of certain types of house work,
including home service to the elderly. Conditional on existing need of home service to the
elderly, 40% of husbands and 57% of wives said they were the main service provider in the
house.

Husbands seem to exaggerate their role as the main contributor: while only 39%

of husbands admitted that their wives being the main provider of old age support, 57% of
wives claiming themselves being the main provider. Similarly, 23% of wives credited their
husbands as the main contributor of old age support in the house, while 40% of husbands
credited as such themselves. Unfortunately, this question was not asked in the rural sample,
but rural couples were more likely to live with the husband's parents at the time of marriage
(59% rural, 31% urban, according to husband's answer), and it is quite rare to live with the
wife's parents in both rural and urban areas (5% rural, 6% urban, according to husband's
answer). At the time of the survey, fewer rural couples were still living with the husband's
parents (29% rural and 39.9% urban), but this is partly because more rural parents have
passed away, and rural parents have more children to live with so that the probability of
living with a particular child would be lower.
To recap, the survey data conrm that parents, especially rural parents, rely on their
adult children for old age support, and old age support is typically provided by son and
daughter-in-law. Within the couple, the wife is more likely to provide home services to the
elderly if such need arises. All these suggest that parents have strong incentives to participate

19

in the choice of their daughter-in-law, especially in rural areas.
Because old age support in the household is usually provided by the wife, its eective
delivery requires values and beliefs conforming to a traditional society. Indeed, for thousands
of years in Chinese history, a top value for children is lial piety (Cheung, 1972), which
emphasizes being obedient and submissive to parents.
character in the term lial piety,
orders of parents.

Interestingly, the second Chinese

xiao shun, literally means being submissive and following

This is especially important for picking a wife for the son:

the son

was already trained to be obedient to parents within the household for all the growing-up
years, but the wife will join the family as an adult and it may be dicult to train her to
be submissive after marriage. Thus, matchmaking parents would prefer to select a young
woman who has already submitted to those submissive values and is more malleable to the
happiness of the husband's parents.
To measure the submissiveness of the wife, we rely on three specic measures and one
aggregate measure.

First,

Wife Career Unimportant

answer in agreement to the following statement:

is a dummy variable indicating an

a wife's career achievement should not

exceed that of her husband. This indicates conformity to the traditional value of superiority
of man over woman (Cheung, 1972), and makes husbands' wishes easier to carry through in
the family. Second,

No Good Male Friend is a dummy variable indicating the belief that a

married woman should not have a good male friend. Again, this is a preventive belief that
helps to maintain the value of parental investment in picking a submissive and cooperative
wife for their son. With such a belief, there is a much lower chance of marriage disruption,
and parental investment in picking the right wife would have a longer horizon to bear fruit.
This is very similar to what Cheung (1972) interpreted about the Chinese marriage practice
of blind marriage (i.e., groom and bride were supposed to meet each other for the rst
time upon the completion of the procedure on the wedding day): it disallows a young man's
love for beauty to stand in the way of maximizing family wealth via arranged marriages.
Third,

Cannot Reject Sex is a dummy variable that is based on the following question:

do

you think a wife can reject her husband's request for sex? 1. yes, 2. no, 3. yes but hard
to get it accomplished.
takes the value of one.

Wife Submissiveness.

If the answers are 2 and 3, then the dummy

Cannot Reject Sex

Finally, the three measures are summed into an aggregate index,

Clearly, a higher value of

Wife Submissiveness implies a wife who is

more submissive, easier to govern, and more conducive to parents' old age support. As a
comparison, we also measure wife traits by wife schooling. Since highly educated women often
have their own ideas and face more job and social opportunities outside home, parents may
face a tradeo between having a highly educated daughter-in-law and having a submissive
one.

20

We also measure the husband's belief in providing old age support. Having such a belief
is a key part of BMS (2015): to ensure old age support, parents invest resources in manipulating children's preferences so that they are more altruistic toward the parents. Because
we argue that parental matchmaking leads to a better fulllment of parents' agenda which
includes old age support, we follow BMS (2015) to examine whether parental matchmaking
is systematically associated with the son having stronger preferences for providing old age
support. One survey question asked: in your view, what is the best way to allocate household assets? 1. to distribute evenly among sons and daughters, 2. mainly to sons, 3. mainly
to daughters, 4. to the sons or daughters that provide old age support. When the answer

Providing Old Age Support, is set equal to 1.
Providing Old Age Support can be interpreted as a measure

of

We however interpret it

mainly as a belief: the wording is not about whether the husband in our survey had received
an ex-ante oer of inheritance conditional on providing old age support. Such contracts are
uncommon and unenforceable in China. Rather, the question is among a long list of belief
questions, and it is worded as whether the surveyed husband would reward the care-giving
children for providing old age support to him. When the husband believes that providers of
old age support deserve more household assets, two scenarios are likely: either the responding
husband inherently believes in the moral value of adult children providing old age support,
or his parents (or the local community) have instilled this value in him. Either way, those
believing in

Providing Old Age Support tend to have a stronger belief in the duty of adult

children in providing old age support to their parents.
We measure the couple's fertility outcome by their number of children at time of survey,
whether the number of children is above three, and whether the couple have at least one son.
We choose three as the cuto because rural areas do not enforce the one-child policy strictly
if the rst child is a girl, hence it is common to have two children in a rural household.
Having three or more requires more determination and more nancial resources to pay a ne
for violating the one-child policy.
As stated in Section 2, social norm

P arentM atchedm

is measured by the proportion

of parent-matched couples in a marriage market dened by province, urban/rural, and age
cohort. Age cohorts are dened as those at the same age or up to three years older. The
other instrument,

Job0 , includes two dummies:

one for whether an urban husband's rst job

was in a state-owned enterprise and the other for whether a rural husband's rst job was in a
township and village enterprise. We control for husband's schooling, age, mother schooling,
father schooling, membership of Communist Party and current job status. The current job
status includes ten dummies: for an urban husband, we code whether his current job is a

21

state-owned enterprise, a collective rm, a privately owned rm, a foreign rm or a rm of
other ownership types; for a rural husband, we code whether his current job is in household
production, farming, household non-agricultural activities, a township and village enterprise,
or other activities. At the district/township level, we control for log income per capita and
average schooling. Whether the area is urban or rural is absorbed by the husband's current
job status.

3.3

Sample and Summary Statistics

As detailed in Section 2, parental matchmaking is subject to individual-level selection,
and our instruments include the local norm of parental matchmaking. As a result, we need
a sample suciently large to compute the norm in each province-urban-age cell where age
refers to the same age as or up to three years older than the survey respondent. We thus
delete any province-urban-age cells that contain fewer than 35 observations. The number of
35 is somewhat arbitrary, but it ensures a reasonable number of observations to compute the
mean (excluding oneself ), while at the same time not losing too many observations of the
sample. This restriction leads to a sample with males no older than early 50s at the time
of survey (1990). Dropping old males has an added benet: the individuals who remain in
our sample do need to consider old age support for their parents, which suits the purpose of
this paper. In total, we have 6,334 husbands in the analysis sample, 57.6% of whom lived in
rural areas at the time of survey.
Table 1 presents the summary statistics for the pooled sample rst, and then parentmatched and self-matched samples separately. Column 4 presents the dierence between the
parent-matched and self-matched couples, along with the standard deviation and t-statistics
of the mean comparison. Overall, 33.8% of couples were formed via parental matchmaking,
but rural couples relied on parents for matching much more frequently (48% vs.

14.5%).

Relative to self-matched couples, the parent-matched are less harmonious, more likely to
have conicts, and have lower combined income.

Husbands in parent-matched marriages

have signicantly lower schooling (by 1.6 years), signicantly less educated parents (by 1-2
years), and are less likely to be a Communist Party member, which is associated with higher
earning power (Li et al., 2007).

While these attributes are consistent with the selection

story  less desirable men are more likely to get help from parents in spouse searching
 parent-matched husbands actually get married 1.6 years younger than the self-matched.
One possible explanation is that they are subject to more traditional family values and face
more pressure to marry early. This is conrmed by dierent strengths of parental matching
norm (0.45 for parent-matched couples and 0.3 for self-matched couples). Consistent with
our prediction, parent-matched husbands also tend to have more children (1.895 vs. 1.518)

22

and a higher likelihood to have at least one son (0.753 vs. 0.637). Urban husbands were less
likely to start the rst job in a state-owned enterprise if they were matched by their parents,
but there is no signicant dierence in whether a rural husband started his rst job in a
township or village enterprise. Neither is there signicant dierence in the husband's belief
on providing old age support between parent- and self-matches.
Wives in parent-matched marriages have 2.4 fewer years of education, are less likely to
work outside home, and earn less annual income. Parent-matched wives are more likely to be
submissive than self-matched wives by 1/3 standard deviation. These signicant dierences
between self- and parent-matched couples suggest serious selection of parental matchmaking
by individual characteristics.

That being said, parental matchmaking is associated with

lower values in indicators of local development as well. Parent-matched marriages are more
likely to appear in places where the norm of parental matchmaking is stronger, the average
income is lower, and the average schooling is lower. Given the rigid hukou system in China
and the lack of migration in 1990, these geographic dierences are likely beyond the control
of any individual in our sample.
Table 2 examines the assortative matching property between husband schooling and wife
schooling. If parental matchmaking is mainly used as the last resort when an unattractive
man could not nd a wife by himself, parental matchmaking should be negatively correlated
with husband schooling at the individual level (as we have seen in Table 1), but the marketwide proportion of parental matchmaking should not correlate with the assortative matching
between husband and wife schooling. On the other hand, if parents engage in matchmaking
with an eye on the traits of the daughter-in-law that may help them obtain more parental
goods, they may intentionally reinforce or weaken the assortative matching in schooling.
Dening each marriage market by province-urban-age, Table 2 shows that a husband and
a wife are much less assortatively matched if the market has a stronger norm for parental
matchmaking. In other words, parents of a highly educated man may prefer a daughter-inlaw of lower education than what will arise in a self-matched market. This result is signicant
and robust even after we control for the average schooling of the province-urban-age cell,
which is likely to indicate the educational and economic development of that market.
Using the husband sample, Table 3 shows a linear-probability estimation on the de-

job seems to matter too, where a rural man who started his rst job in a town and village
enterprise is less likely to use parental matchmaking. The schooling variables, however, do
not exhibit any signicant impact on whether a son uses parental help in matching, which
is still true when alternative schooling categories are used. An explanation for this lack of
eect is that the human capital variable in our model is much more general than formal
schooling; it also includes a person's character and charisma, which are often unobservable
but inuential in matchmaking. This is why we need to use instruments to control for the
selection eect.

4 Empirical Results
4.1

Love and Joint Income

We rst show how parental matchmaking relates to marital harmony and joint couple income.
To isolate the eects of parental matchmaking, we include a long list of control variables:

14 (2) parents' schooling; (3) political

the husband's (1) own age (in log) and schooling;

aliation with the Communist Party; (4) religion dummies (Muslim, Christian, Buddhist)
and ethnicity dummies (Hui, Korean, Manchu, or other minorities); (5) current job type (10
dummies); and (6) local development as measured by the average income and schooling in
the district or township where the couple live.

15 Rural and urban regions dier greatly in

marriage markets, but the husband's current job type already accounts for the rural-urban
dierence hence we do not report a separate coecient on the rural dummy.
The key-right-hand side variable is parental matchmaking. As discussed in Section 2, a
less competent son with more competent parents is more likely to rely on parental search.
This is why we control for both child and parent characteristics in the regression. Nevertheless, selection based on unobservable individual characteristics is still likely. To deal with
such individual-level selections, Table 4A rst reports the OLS result and then progressively
use

P arentM atchedm , Job0 , and both as instruments for the matchmaking choice.

The rst

four columns focus on harmony, while the last four columns focus on log joint couple income.
All standard errors are White-corrected and clustered at the district/township level since we
have local income and schooling controls at this level. The rst-stage Kleibergen-Paap Wald
Rank (KPWR) F statistics and the AR weak-instrument robust test (Finlay and Magnusson, 2009) are reported at the bottom of each IV column. Whenever we use more than one

computing the local average to avoid articial correlation of these variables and the outcomes of an individual.

Their inclusion did not aect any of our key results.

Further study shows that this dierence is driven by

In Table 4B, we repeat the OLS and IV estimation (using

P arentM atchedm and Job0 as instruments) but include an interaction of the rural

in

P arentM atched

by one standard deviation for urban areas would lead to an increase in

couple income by 0.2 standard deviations, consistent with Huang, Jin and Xu (2012). For
rural areas, the corresponding eect is a drop in couple income by 0.3 standard deviations.
The rural-urban distinction reects dierent patterns of parental goods and dierent
institutional constraints.

First, in urban areas, market opportunities are more abundant

for both labor and services such as meals, laundry and care-giving, yet the enforcement of
one-child policy is more stringent.

Both factors contribute to urban couples relying more

on monetary income (relative to household production) to deliver parental goods.

As a

consequence, parents in their self-interest would want to ensure that the marriage yields
relatively high income.

In contrast, in rural areas, there are fewer opportunities to make

money and buy services (at least during our sample period of early 1990s); but there are
more opportunities to evade the one-child policy.

As a result, rural parents rely more on

married children to provide parental goods directly. We thus witness a substitution of market
production by household production in rural areas, which explains the negative eect of
parental matchmaking on (market) couple income in rural areas.

16

16 The rural-urban separation also helps to explain why the Hansen's J statistics do not pass the over-

25

4.2

Wife Schooling, Labor Market Participation, Income and Submissiveness

To ensure the provision of parental goods, parents may prefer certain traits in the daughterin-law.

Such traits may be proxied directly by wife schooling, or reected indirectly by

wife-related marriage outcomes such as wife's labor market participation, income and submissiveness.

Since some wife traits may conict with each otherfor example, a highly-

educated wife may bring more labor market income to the household but do fewer household
chores and tend to be less submissive in the household; what traits are more preferable by
parents via parental matchmaking remains an open empirical question.
Table 5 reports the OLS and IV results on wife schooling.

Because wife schooling is

pre-determined before marriage, as discussed earlier, there is a potential general equilibrium
problem if we only use market-wide social norm (P arentM atchedm ) as the instrument. We

address it by also using

husband schooling and wife schooling, which is consistent with the market-wide evidence
presented in Table 2. The optimal individual selection model cannot explain why a man facing the same distribution of wife schooling tends to prefer a less-educated wife when parental
matchmaking is more prevalent in the marriage market, but the inuence of parental preference can do so.
Table 6 looks at a wife's annual income and labor participation directly. As described in
Section 3, a rural wife's labor participation is dened by whether her reported annual income
is above 1,500 yuan; this threshold is lowered to 1,000 yuan in the alternative measure. An
urban wife's labor participation is dened by whether she has a job outside home. Overall,
parent-matched wives earn signicantly less and are less likely to participate in the labor
market. This nding is signicant in both OLS and IV specications. One explanation is
that wives in parent-matched marriages are less able to earn income from the labor market,
as suggested by their lower schooling (Table 5). Another possibility is that they tend to specialize more in household production, which is consistent with parents' interest in household
services.
To check whether parental matchmaking favors a submissive wife, a key condition for
delivering parental goods in traditional societies, Table 7 reports regression results rst on
identication test in the full sample for joint couple income (Table 4A). Once we account for the rural-urban
dierence, the Hansen's J statistics are no longer signicant at the 90% condence level for joint couple
income (Table 4B).

Woman Career Not Important, No Good

Results suggest that parent-matched wives tend to

emphasize less on women's careers. Further analysis suggests that this is mostly driven by
rural wives, while urban wives in parent-matched marriages do not dier from other marriages
in terms of downgrading the importance of women's careers.

17

Again, this is consistent

with endogenous preference (Becker, 1996): in urban areas where market opportunities are
greater for women and many household services can be outsourced to the market, less career
discouragement is imposed on women; in rural areas where market opportunities are less for
women and parental goods rely on within-household services, parents discourage women's
market value more. Turning to

No Good Male Friend, parent-matched wives are more likely

to believe that a married woman should not have good male friends. This attitude/preference
is consistent with more marriage stability and more attention to household production.
After all, outside friendship with the opposite sex could lead to more time spent outside
the household or emotional distraction, both of which may destabilize marriage and reduce
the returns of investments that parents have already made in nding the suitable mate for
their son. In both OLS and IV regressions, we do not nd a signicant correlation between

P arentM atched

and whether the wife believes that she should not reject sex requests by

her husband. Nevertheless, we do observe a signicant dierence in fertility between parentand self-matched marriages, which we will describe below.

4.3

Fertility and Belief in Old Age Support

Parents may benet directly from a greater number of grandchildren by enjoying the pleasure
of companionship, help, and simply the altruistic impulse of seeing them growing (my genes
are alive and well in them). In modern society where adult children are often busy working,
grandchildren become regular companions for grandparents at home, and make them feel
more valuable to family. Admittedly, high fertility may dilute resources available to everyone
else in the family, but the cost of bearing and raising more kids may fall disproportionally
on parents than on grandparents:

for example, having more children means more eort

at childcare and less market participation at least by mothers, while the benets of more
children are enjoyed more directly by grandparents. Indirectly, altruistic parents may view

more grandchildren as a warranty for their son's old age support, and thus prefer the couple
to have more children.
Table 8 reports three panels of results on the eects of parental matchmaking on fertility.
Given the imperfect enforcement of the one-child policy in rural areas, it is common to

have two children, so the margin for parents to push is on the third child.

family value also suggests that parents may prefer grandsons to granddaughters (i.e., son
preference), especially if they can instill this preference through selecting a more obedient
daughter-in-law before marriage and push for having a boy after marriage. Consistent with
our expectation, both the OLS and IV results suggest that parent-matched couples have
more children and are more likely to have at least one boy.
BMS (2015) suggests that parents in need of old age support have incentives to induce
more altruistic preference from their sons, in order to ensure smooth and committed delivery
of old age support.

To check this argument, we examine how husband belief in old age

support diers across parent- and self-matched marriages. In the OLS results of Table 9,

P arentM atched

is positively and signicantly correlated with

Providing Old Age Support .

When we use the instrument, the coecient remains signicant and of a large magnitude.
According to the IV results, a one-standard-deviation increase in

P arentM atched

associated with a higher probability of parent-matched husbands to believe in

(0.47) is

Providing Old

Age Support by 0.8 standard deviation. This evidence is consistent with BMS (2015).

5 Conclusion
While many economic studies have examined various aspects of marriages, little attention
has been paid to the role that parents play in their children's marriage formation, to how
various matchmaking means aect the selection of spouse and marriage outcomes, and to
how institutional dierences such as the provision of old age support shape the eect of
matchmaking means. In this paper, we use unique data on Chinese households in the early
1990s to examine what types of people use parental matchmaking (versus relying on self
matches), and how parental matchmaking aects marriage harmony, income, fertility, the
belief in providing old age support, and wife traits that are conducive to the delivery of
parental goods.
In a simple theoretical framework, we show that parental matchmaking may distort
the son's optimal spouse selection because parents emphasize a potential wife's ability and
temperament for providing sharable household goods, and downplay the love or emotional
chemistry within the couple. Put dierently, relative to the son, parents are more willing to

18 Three or more children is much less likely in urban (6.3%) than in rural areas (23.5%).

28

substitute love within the couple for sharable parental goods (including old age support).
We nd supporting evidence for the model: parental matchmaking is associated with less
marital harmony within the couple, more submissive wives, less labor market participation
of wives, lower wife income, a greater number of children, a higher likelihood of having any
boy, and the husband's stronger belief in providing old age support. These results render
support to the view of BMS (2015) that parents would meddle with children's preferences
to ensure their commitment to providing parental goods such as old age support.
We also nd suggestive evidence that urban and rural areas use dierent supporting
mechanisms for parental goods. In urban areas, with more labor market opportunities and
more stringent enforcement of the one-child policy, parents rely more on the monetary income
channel to ensure old age support, and as a result, parental matchmaking is associated with
higher joint couple income (Huang et al., 2012). In contrast, in rural areas, labor market
opportunities are fewer and it is easier to evade the one-child policy. As a result, parents
rely more on household production, and joint income tends to be lower for parent matched
couples than for self-matched couples in rural areas. The rural-urban dierence is consistent
with an insight from Cheung (1972): institutions often evolve to serve the prevalent needs
of economic players. Here, parental matchmaking is conducive to the delivery of parental
goods: when market is less eective, parental matchmaking is more likely to be adopted to
ensure that parental goods are adequately provided by married children.
Overall, our analysis suggests that parental matchmaking introduces an interesting tradeo.

On the one hand, it entails agency costs in terms of less love within the couple.

On

the other hand, it helps to ensure parental goods for the matchmaking parents, and a more
harmonious inter-generational relationship.

Since our sample period, China has evolved

towards more state-provided pension and health insurance for rural households and the
urban poor. As more and more old age support is provided outside household, and more labor
market opportunities arise even for rural people through means such as migration, traditional
values such as lial piety and submissiveness of children may become less important for
parents and increasingly unproductive for the society as a whole (e.g, it may discourage
risk-taking and innovation among the young), not to mention that it is also more dicult
to enforce such values when inter-generational cohabitation becomes rarer. If our theory is
right, we expect parental matchmaking to play dierent roles in this transition. After all,
with more old age support from the society and more market oering for household services,
parents have less need to manipulate children's preferences or to select submissive but less
capable (in market production) daughters-in-law. This topic warrants future research.

f , hm )
33

(6)

α∗ > α∗∗ and α∗ f (h∗f , hm ) > α∗∗ f (h∗∗
f , hm ); the reason is as
∗
∗∗
∗ ∗
∗∗ ∗
∗∗ ∗∗

∗∗
follows. (i) If hf > hf , then α (hf ) > α (hf ) > α (hf ) holds, and it implies α > α ,

where the rst inequality follows α (hf ) > α (hf ) and the second follows ∂α (hf )/∂hf > 0.
∗
∗∗

And α f (hf , hm ) > α f (hf , hm ) follows directly from hf > hf and α > α . (ii) If
h∗f ≤ h∗∗
f , then we have
must hold, which then implies

∗∗
∗∗
∗
∗
(β + α∗ )f (h∗∗
f , hm ) ≥ (β + α )f (hf , hm ) > (β + α )f (hf , hm ),

where the rst and third terms imply

α∗ > α∗∗

; the rst inequality holds because

h∗f ≤ h∗∗
f ,

while the second inequality is based on (6). And following similar arguments we can derive

α∗ f (h∗f , hm ) > α∗∗ f (h∗∗
f , hm )

by comparing the rst and third terms in

∗∗
∗∗
βf (h∗∗
f , hm ) + α f (hf , hm ) ≥ (β + α )f (hf , hm ) > (β + α )f (hf , hm ).

Based on (5), the utility dierence between self and parents' searching is

π ≡ U ∗ − U ∗∗ = (β + α∗ )f (h∗f , hm ) − ηm c(α∗ , h∗f , hm ) − (β + α∗∗ )f (h∗∗
f , hm ),
which is strictly decreasing in

because

∗∗
∗∗
∂π/∂hp = −f (h∗∗
f , hm )∂α /∂hp − (β + α )f1 (hf , hm )∂hf /∂hp < 0.

We get

∂π/∂hm > 0

for the following reason. Note that

∂π/∂hm =

∂U ∗
− ∂(β + α∗∗ )f (h∗∗
f , hm )/∂hm ,

|(α∗∗ ,h∗f ) > ∂(β + α∗∗ )f (h∗f , hm )/∂hm ,
∂hm
∂hm

(9)

α∗ > α∗∗ , and the second inequality is because the

positive. (i) If hf > hf , then ∂ (β + α)f (hf , hm )/∂hm ∂hf =

where the rst inequality is because

∂U ∗

second term of

∂hm

in (8) is

f12 (hf , hm ) > 0

implies

∂(β + α∗∗ )f (h∗f , hm )/∂hm > ∂(β + α∗∗ )f (h∗∗
f , hm )/∂hm ,
which combined with the inequality in (9) implies

∂U ∗
|(α∗ ,h∗f ) > ∂(β + α∗∗ )f (h∗∗

∂hm
and this leads to

When

∂hm

is the case, the result can be derived in a similar way due to
