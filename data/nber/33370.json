    "abstract": "\n\nThis chapter examines the multifaceted interactions between top digital platforms and technology ventures across capital, labor, innovation, and product markets. Exploring how venture investments, talent flows, strategic alliances, and competitive behaviors can shape the innovation ecosystem, the chapter highlights both the complementary and competitive dynamics between large incumbents and smaller entrants, and the benefits and potential inefficiencies that may arise from them, as demonstrated by the empirical and theoretical literatures. Throughout, the chapter identifies key areas for research that can support a rigorous evaluation of policy proposals concerning evolving market structures in the digital economy.\n\n",
