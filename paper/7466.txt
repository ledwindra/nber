1 Introduction: International Sources of Labor Market Churning
The gains from international trade are obtained through the reallocation of resources to their most productive uses. This reallocation is not costless, however,
and a full understanding of the overall impact of trade must consider both efficiency benefits and adjustment costs. Indeed, much of the debate over the net
benefits of openness concerns the size of these adjustment costs, especially those
arising from changes in employment. As noted in the 1998 Economic Report of
the President, “The public debate over trade liberalization
[has] focused on
the distributional impact of increased trade. This issue arises from the tendency
of increased trade to favor some domestic industries while putting others at a disadvantage” (pp. 238-39).
As suggested by this quote, an important source of internationally generated
adjustment costs is changing patterns of employment that, in turn, reflect responses to movements in the real exchange rate. This role of the real exchange
rate arises for two reasons. First, the volatility of the multilateral U.S. real exchange rate makes it a likely source of changing employment patterns between
sectors selling internationally traded goods (such as manufacturing) and other sectors selling goods and services that do not directly face international competition.
Furthermore, a given movement in the real exchange rate can generate a wide
range of responses within traded-goods sectors, since exposure to international
competition varies widely, even among firms within narrowly defined industries
(Bernard and Jensen 1995).
This paper contributes to an understanding of internationally generated adjustment costs by demonstrating a statistically significant and economically important
effect of the real exchange rate on gross job flows in manufacturing industries in
the United States. Gross job flows consist of the total number of employment positions gained (job creation) and the total number of employment positions lost (job
destruction) by all firms within a sector. An associated measure of labor market
churning, job reallocation, is the sum of job creation and job destruction.1 These
gross job flow measures are more closely associated with labor market adjustment
than the more conventional measure of net employment change, which represents
the difference between the job creation rate and the job destruction rate, since net
change does not fully account for intrasectoral job flows. Previous research has

focused almost exclusively on the effects of international factors on net employment flows.2
Gross job flows are an important aspect of the manufacturing sector of the
United States. For example, the average annual reallocation rate in manufacturing over the period 1973 to 1993 was 19 percent, while during the same period
the average net decrease in overall manufacturing employment was 1.4 percent.
Through reallocation, workers move to more productive and more remunerative
positions as new opportunities become available and as new jobs are created. But
labor market reallocation across sectors and regions has a costly side as well. In
the wake of job destruction, workers could experience a protracted period of unemployment during their search for a new job. Successful reemployment may
require retraining, which itself demands time and resources, or moving to another
part of the country. Furthermore, firm-specific skills, and possibly sector-specific
skills, are rendered useless with job destruction and, as a consequence, wages in
new jobs may not match previous wages.
Since the basis of simultaneous job creation and job destruction is heterogeneity across firms, we present evidence in the next section on the extent of
heterogeneity with respect to international competition in U.S. manufacturing.
Openness among manufacturing industries increases over time but the increasing divergence in the degree of openness across industries is even more striking.
This divergence occurs even within seemingly narrow categories of manufacturing industries. Taking this pervasive heterogeneity in openness as a starting point,
we present a model in Section 3 in which simultaneous job creation and job destruction arise within a sector in response to movements in the real exchange rate.
This model motivates our estimating equation.
Section 4 presents the results from our econometric analysis of the effects of
the real exchange rate on job creation and destruction. Job destruction in 4-digit
SIC industries responds significantly to real exchange rate appreciations. For
example, we estimate that the real exchange rate appreciation of the early 1980s
caused a cumulative increase in the job destruction rate of 14.4 percentage points
over five years, controlling for many other aggregate and industry-level factors.
This overall effect for manufacturing is accompanied by divergent movements
across more narrowly defined manufacturing sectors. We find statistically significant and economically relevant evidence of heterogeneous responsiveness of job

(1998b) studies data on gross worker flows.

destruction to appreciations in the exchange rate resulting from differences in the
degree of openness among industries. This suggests an international source of job
churning among manufacturing industries. Interestingly, however, job creation
does not respond significantly to changes in the real exchange rate.

2 Job Flows and Openness Across Industries and
Across Time
The focus of this paper is the study of how job flows in detailed industries respond
differently to changes in the real exchange rate and thus give rise to job reallocation. An initial issue, then, is the extent of heterogeneity among manufacturing
industries, both with respect to job flows and with respect to international exposure. In this section we present evidence on these issues.
In Section 2.1 we investigate the heterogeneity in job creation and job destruction among manufacturing industries. We show that much of the cross-sectional
variation in job flows occurs within narrowly defined industries rather than between broader industry groups. But the main source of the time series crosssectional variation in the job flow rates of 4-digit industries is temporal variation,
rather than any persistent cross-sectional differences in the degree of job churning.
We show that the real exchange rate significantly affects the temporal behavior of
the job destruction rate for the overall manufacturing sector.
The focus of our interest, however, is the differential responses to movements
in the real exchange rate among manufacturing industries. A particular industry’s
response to the real exchange rate is likely linked to how open it is to international
trade. Therefore, the cross-sectional variation in job creation and job destruction induced by the real exchange rate reflects, in part, cross-sectional variation
in openness. In Section 2.2 we present some information on openness across
manufacturing industries in the United States. We show that openness among
manufacturing has grown markedly over the past three decades. More to the
point for the focus of this paper, the dispersion of openness among manufacturing
sectors has also grown. We find that openness among manufacturing industries
is not well explained by standard industrial groupings, a result with important
implications for the manner in which we conduct our empirical investigation.

2.1

Gross Job Flows in Manufacturing

It has been noted elsewhere that gross job flow data reveal significant churning in
the labor market for manufacturing jobs in the United States. 3 In this section
we define job creation and job destruction, the components of gross job flows.
We present the empirical evidence on job destruction and job creation across all
manufacturing sectors, along with the time path of the real exchange rate. We
also examine the degree of heterogeneity in gross job flows across sectors.
Our data on industry-level job creation and destruction come from Davis,
Haltiwanger, and Schuh (1996), in file RZI4.DAT, constructed from the panel
of manufacturing plants in the Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Research Database
(LRD). Our data on industry-level international trade come from the NBER export and import data base described in Abowd (1990) and Feenstra (1996, 1997).4
These job flows and trade data are supplemented with data on other manufacturing
activity from the NBER Productivity Database described in Bartelsman and Gray
(1996). 5 This combined data set provides a panel of annual data for 442 4-digit
manufacturing industries over the period 1973 to 1993.6
Job creation rates and job destruction rates are calculated from plant-level net
be the level of a manufacturing plant’s employemployment changes. Let
ment, where the subscripts denote plant ( ), industry ( ), and time ( ), and let
denote the first-difference operator,
. Following Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh (1996), we define job creation in a manufacturing plant as:

Our data are annual because the trade and productivity data are only available at that frequency. In principle, it would be preferable to have higher frequency data when studying exchange
rates. However, the annual data actually are advantageous because they omit high frequency transitory fluctuations in the exchange rate that probably do not induce job creation and destruction
responses because job flows are costly and time-consuming.

The gross job creation rate in industry in year , , represents the sum of all
positive employment changes across all establishments in that industry in that year
divided by total industry employment that year.7 Likewise, the corresponding
gross job destruction rate,
, represents the sum of the absolute value of all
negative employment changes across all establishments in that industry divided
by total industry employment. The average value of the annual job creation rate in
jobs created per
positions
manufacturing over the period 1973 to 1993 was
each year, while the comparable average rate of job destruction was
jobs
destroyed per
positions each year (Schuh and Triest 1998). Reallocation
within industry in year ,
, is defined as the sum of its creation and destruction
rates (
), while its rate of net change in employment,
, can be
calculated by subtracting the job destruction rate from the job creation rate (
). Thus, the average annual rate of job reallocation in manufacturing was
percent between 1973 and 1993 while, during this period, the manufacturing
jobs per 100 positions (numbers do not
sector saw an average net decline of
add due to rounding).
Statistics on the average annual values of gross job flows fail to reveal the
wide swings that have sometimes occurred over our sample period. Figure 1
shows that the rates gross job flows vary widely over time, as shown in Figure 1,
for the manufacturing sector over the period 1973 to 1992.8 The reallocation rate
exceeded percent in half the years of the sample, reaching a high of percent
in 1983. The figure demonstrates that the job destruction rate is more volatile
than the job creation rate, with the job destruction rate exceeding
percent in
three years, 1975, 1982, and 1983.
Figure 1 also provides some preliminary evidence on the correlation between
manufacturing gross job flows and the business cycle. Shaded bars in the figure
represent periods of recession. The data in the figure suggest that the job destruction rate is strongly countercyclical, while the job creation rate is procyclical.
The figure also depicts the multilateral real exchange rate over the sample period,
with an increase in this measure indicating an appreciation of the dollar. The job
destruction rate appears to be linked to the real exchange rate, exhibiting higher
values when the real exchange rate is strong and lower values when the real ex-

For reasons described in Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh (1996), the gross job flows are defined
as March-to-March changes rather than calendar-year changes like our other data. We match data
sampling periods as best as possible using lags. About a one-quarter mismatch remains, but it does
not appear to seriously affect the timing of relationships between variables at annual frequencies.

In this figure, the annual job flows data have been interpolated to a quarterly frequency to
permit accurate plotting of business cycle dates.

exchange rate as closely.
The relationships suggested by inspection of the figures are supported by simple regressions using the annual job creation rate in manufacturing, , the annual
job destruction rate in manufacturing, , the lagged percentage change in the real
exchange rate,
, and the lagged percentage change in manufacturing
industrial production,
. Estimating these equations over the period
1974 to 1993, we find

where standard errors are in parentheses. The coefficients in these regressions
are all of the expected sign, and the coefficients in the destruction equation are
significant at the 5 percent level.
These results suggest an important role for the real exchange rate in job destruction; for example, over the period from 1982 to 1986, the job destruction rate
in manufacturing averaged
percent, 2 full percentage points above its unconditional sample average of
percent. The average value of the lagged change
in the exchange rate during that time was
percent. Thus, more than percent
of the average increase in the job destruction rate (
percentage
points of the percentage point rise) may be attributable to the real exchange rate
appreciation.
These results contrast with the evidence presented by Davis, Haltiwanger and
Schuh (1996) who find “Strikingly,
no systematic relationship between the
magnitude of gross job flows and exposure to international trade” (p. 48). This
conclusion is based upon an analysis in which 4-digit industries are sorted by two
measures of foreign trade exposure, the import penetration ratio and the export
share. Industries are divided into 5 categories based on these exposure measures.
There is no evidence, using this method, that the average rates of job destruction,
job creation or job reallocation over the period 1973 to 1988 are associated with
differences in international exposure (see their Table 3.5). But one would not expect to find that the factors that determine long-run import penetration or long-run
export share across industries, such as resource endowments and geography, are

correlated with the those that determine long-run gross labor flows across industries, such as the costs of hiring and firing. The evidence presented here, however,
suggests that international factors may be an important source of the time series
behavior of job destruction, job creation, and job reallocation.
In Section 4 of the paper we investigate whether the real exchange rate is an
important source of the cross-sectional time series behavior of job creation and destruction. While the regressions reported above suggest a role for the reallocative
effects of the real exchange rate between the manufacturing and the nonmanufacturing sectors of the economy, an analysis of job reallocation within manufacturing requires consideration of the differential effects of the real exchange rate
on job creation rates and job destruction rates at a much more disaggregated level.
Differential cross-sectional responses to a common shock, such as to the exchange
rate, requires cross-sectional variation in gross job flows. In this section we introduce this topic by addressing the degree of heterogeneity of job flows across
disaggregated manufacturing industries.
The presence of simultaneous creation and destruction for the manufacturing
sector as a whole is to be expected since there is evidence of a great deal of heterogeneity, even within narrowly defined industries. For example, we find either
creation and no destruction or destruction and no creation for any 4-digit SIC industry in any year in only about two-tenths of 1 percent of all observations. In only
about percent of all observations is the rate of job destruction or the rate of job
creation less than percent. There are very few cases of low rates of job creation
even if we consider only observations when job destruction was large. Job creation was less than percent in only
percent of the cases when job destruction
was above its national average value of
percent. Likewise, job destruction
was less than percent in only
percent of the cases when job creation was
above its national average of
percent.
Table 1 provides a more systematic examination of heterogeneity in gross job
flows among industries. This table displays the adjusted
values from regressions of the annual rates of job creation and job destruction of 4-digit industries
on different sets of dummy variables, using ANOVA. Column 1 reports the

destruction explained by industry categories. If, for example, all 4-digit indus-

tries within any 2-digit category had very similar measures of job creation, then
we would find a large adjusted
in a regression of job creation on a set of 2-digit
dummy variables and little difference between this adjusted
and the ones we
would obtain for regressions of job creation on a set of 3-digit dummy variables
or on a set of 4-digit dummy variables.
The top panel of Table 1 reports results for regressions using a pooled sample
representing all 21 years for which we have job flows data. In this pooled data set,
job creation rates and job destruction rates vary both over 4-digit industries and
over time. The results in the table indicate that the adjusted
values are only
for job creation and
for job destruction when these rates are regressed on
a complete set of 4-digit industry dummy variables. This suggests that temporal
variation in the job flow rates of 4-digit industries is a much more important contributor to their overall variance than are any persistent differences across 4-digit
industries in the degree of job churning.
The bottom panel of Table 1 reports results that isolate the cross-sectional
variation in openness by performing a comparable ANOVA using data from a
single year, 1990.9 The results presented in the bottom panel show that very little
of the cross-sectional variation in job flow rates among 4-digit industries in that
year is due to systematic differences in job churn rates between more aggregated
industry groups. For example, only percent of the cross-sectional variation in

job destruction rates is explained by a 4-digit industry’s membership in a 2-digit
category, and only percent is explained by its membership in a 3-digit industry
category.
Heterogeneity in job creation and job destruction across industries due to
movements in the real exchange rate should reflect, in part, heterogeneity in the
exposure of these industries to international competition. In the next section we
discuss the growth and heterogeneity of narrowly defined manufacturing industries as they relate to one measure of exposure to international competition.

2.2

Growth and Heterogeneity in Openness

It has been widely noted that the U.S. economy has become more open over time.
But, as with many popular notions, the details behind this fact are both less well
known and provide a more nuanced picture. In this section we confirm the presence of an overall growth in openness in manufacturing. But we also demonstrate that the change in openness over time varies widely across industries, with
openness increasing among some industries while other industries remain largely
closed.
The general increase in openness over time among U.S. manufacturing industries as well the increasingly divergent relationship among industries with respect
to international trade is captured in Figure 2. In this figure, and throughout the
rest of this section, we define openness as the sum of the value of an industry’s
exports plus imports as a proportion of the sum of that industry’s domestic sales,
exports, and imports. Figure 2 shows the range (10th to 90th percentiles), median value, lower quartile value, and upper quartile value of openness for 4-digit
industries over the period 1958 to 1994.
This figure confirms the upward trend in openness over time, with the median
value of the ratio of exports plus imports to shipments increasing from percent
in 1958 to
percent in 1994. This growth in the median value of this measure
of openness proceeded somewhat unevenly over the sample, with relatively little
change from the late 1950s until the end of the 1960s, when the average annual
change in the median value of openness was
percent. The pace of the growth
of openness quickened after 1972. Between 1972 and 1987 the median value
of openness grew at an average annual rate of
percent. This growth has
accelerated slightly in recent years, with an annual average growth rate of
percent between 1987 and 1994.
Perhaps the most striking aspect of Figure 2, however, is not the growth in
the median value of openness from the late 1950s to mid 1990s, but the increas-

ingly divergent international exposure of 4-digit industries. While some industries throughout the period essentially had no direct international exposure, the
value of openness at the 75th percentile of industries quadrupled, from
to
percent, and the th percentile rose from to percent. This increase in openness at the top end of the distribution was not matched by a parallel increase in
openness in absolute terms among the industries at the lower end. Thus the range
of openness between 75th and 25th percentiles increased from to percentage
points, and the range between the th and 10th percentiles increased from
percentage points to percentage points.
The data presented in Figure 2 reveal the range of openness but not the composition of industries constituting high, medium, or low values of openness. One
may expect similar levels of openness among industries producing common products. In fact, this is not the case. We regress the values of openness for 4-digit industries on three different sets of dummy variables representing more aggregated
industry categories; the broad classification of durable / nondurable industries, the
larger set of 20 2-digit industry indicators and the set of 143 3-digit categories. In
reflects the extent of openness explained by industry
each case, the adjusted
categories. The increase in
from one regression to another shows the marginal
difference explained by a more disaggregated set of industry indicators.
The results from each of these three regressions, using the measure of openness in 1990 for 4-digit industries, are presented in Table 2. This table shows
that there is virtually no difference on average between the openness of durable
and nondurable manufacturing industries, with an adjusted
of only
in a
regression using only one dummy variable to distinguish between nondurable and
durable industries. The amount of variation in openness explained by membership in a particular 2-digit industry is also relatively small since the adjusted

. Regressing openness on 3-digit industry dummy variables raises the adjusted
to
, well above its value when using 2-digit industry dummies but
still below one-half.
These results indicate a great deal of heterogeneity in the degree of openness,
largely unrelated to differences among 2-digit or even 3-digit industry groupings.
This suggests that substantial differences are likely in the extent to which real
exchange rate movements affect job creation and destruction across the industries
that constitute a particular 2-digit or even 3-digit industry.
Increasing heterogeneity over time, as depicted in Figure 2, may reflect the
fact that the most open industries in 1958 became even more open over time while
the most closed industries at the beginning of the period remained closed. Alternatively, the data shown in Figure 2 could also be consistent with significant
churning, whereby industries that were relatively closed early in the sample period may have become more open over time, while other industries experienced
little change in openness or even a decline. We present a transition matrix to
address the question of the stability of the ranking of industries by openness over
time.
The transition matrix in Table 3 presents the percentage distribution for quintiles with respect to openness in 1973 of the 4-digit industries against the respective percentage distributions for 1993 (the range of years for which we have job
flows data for our regression analysis). This table demonstrates that relatively
little reshuffling has occurred in the ranking of industries’ degrees of openness.
Fifty-two percent of the 4-digit industries stayed in the same openness quintile between 1973 and 1993 and 88 percent stayed in either the same quintile or moved

to an adjoining quintile. Note, however, that the cutoff values of openness for each
quintile more than doubled during this period, confirming the overall increase in
openness we first noted in Figure 2.
These statistics offer an interesting depiction of the growth and heterogeneity
of openness in United States manufacturing industries. The average degree of
openness has increased enormously in recent decades. The tendency has been for
all industries to become more open over time, but the biggest increase in openness has been in the industries that were initially most open. This has resulted in
an increasingly large degree of heterogeneity in openness to trade across 4-digit
manufacturing industries. Some industries have become strongly integrated into
the global economy, but others have remained largely isolated from international
competition. Very little of this heterogeneity is associated with differences between broad industry groups. Even within 3-digit industries, the variance in the
importance of international trade is large.
These characteristics of openness and gross job flows are important to keep in
mind as we formulate a model of the relationship between the real exchange rate
and job creation and destruction. In the next section we develop a model, which
we implement in Section 4, drawing on the insights provided here.

3 Heterogeneity, Gross Job Flows, and the Real Exchange Rate
Simultaneous job creation and job destruction within a narrowly defined industry
suggest an important role for heterogeneity among firms in that industry. There
are two conceptually distinct ways of moving beyond a “representative firm” to
model heterogeneity among firms in an industry. Firms may have structural differences such that a common shock has distinct effects across firms, or firms may
have a common structure but face idiosyncratic shocks.10 We focus on the heterogeneity arising out of structural differences across firms, since the focus of this
paper is an empirical investigation of the effect of an aggregate variable, the real
exchange rate, on job creation and destruction.
10

The independent effects of aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks on gross job flows have been
studied by Mortensen and Pissarides (1994), among others. We abstract from idiosyncratic shocks
here. While acknowledging that idiosyncratic shocks may be responsible for significant gross job
flows, we assume that such shocks are independent of, and uncorrelated with, movements in the
real exchange rate.

14

It is important to note that structural differences alone will not generate simultaneous job creation and job destruction in our framework. Spillover effects,
whereby the actions of one set of firms affects the outcomes of another set of firms,
are also required. To illustrate this point, consider a situation where firms within
an industry sell a similar, but not necessarily identical, product. The demand
for each of these different products increases with a depreciation in the exchange
rate and decreases with an appreciation, although the size of the response varies
widely across the set of products. When firms face a perfectly elastic supply of all
inputs, a depreciation causes job creation among all firms while an appreciation
causes job destruction among all firms.
However, in the polar case where labor supply to the industry as a whole is
perfectly inelastic, the expansion of workers employed by one firm must come
at the expense of the number of workers hired by another firm. In this case, a
depreciation leads to both job creation, among firms that experience the greatest
relative increase in demand for their goods, and job destruction, among firms with
the smallest relative increase in demand for their goods. There is no job creation
or job destruction when all firms respond in exactly the same way to a given
change in the exchange rate. Therefore, in this case, the amount of reallocation is
tied to the extent of heterogeneity among firms within the industry.
This pattern of simultaneous creation and destruction need not hold in the
more general case where a shift in the industrywide demand for labor elicits a
supply response. For example, with a sufficient labor supply response, a depreciation can lead to industrywide job creation and no job destruction, while an
appreciation can lead to industrywide job destruction and no job creation.
The main themes of this illustration, the role of heterogeneity and spillover
effects, can be made more explicit and a bit more general through a simple model.

for labor although the actual amount of labor hired by a firm will also depend upon labor supply
considerations.

4 Regression Implementation and Results
The model discussed above offers a general framework for our empirical specification. In this section we address several issues that are necessary for using that
general framework to develop and implement a specification that we can use in
our empirical analysis. We draw on the insights of both the model presented in
Section 3 and the statistics presented in Section 2.

4.1

Empirical Implementation

The central issue in implementing the model concerns the manner in which we
control for heterogeneity across industries in their responsiveness to movements
in the real exchange rate. A standard way to control for differences in structure
in a time series cross-section data set like ours is to run separate regressions for
each set of 2-digit SIC industries; in this case we might choose to run 20 separate
time-series cross-section regressions, one for each of the 2-digit manufacturing
industries, with a cross-sectional component ranging from four 4-digit industries
for the 2-digit industry Tobacco Products (SIC 21) to forty-seven 4-digit industries
for the 2-digit industry Food and Kindred Products (SIC 20).
But our model suggests that the main source of heterogeneity across industries
in the response to real exchange rate movements is differences in the degree of
openness across industries. The response of job flows to the real exchange rate
is likely to increase with the degree of openness of an industry.15 The traditional
approach of estimating separate regressions for each 2-digit industry assumes a
rough comparability among all 4-digit industries within a 2-digit category with
respect to their degree of openness. Statistics presented in Section 2 indicate,
however, pervasive heterogeneity with respect to openness across the sets of 4digit industries that constitute the respective 2-digit groupings. This suggests that
an effort to control for heterogeneity with respect to openness by running separate
regressions for each 2-digit industry is not likely to be successful.
An alternative approach is to use the entire sample in a regression but to control
for openness through the use of an interactive variable. In the model presented

where
indexes 4-digit industries and indexes years. The dependent variables,
é
ê , are annual rates of job creation and job destruction. Because of
and
heterogeneity of firms and plants within 4-digit industries, during any given year
there is likely to be simultaneous job creation and destruction. Previous research
has demonstrated that job destruction is much more sensitive than job creation
to changes in business cycle conditions, and it is of interest to investigate if this
relationship also holds for changes in the real exchange rate.16
In constructing the real exchange rate change variables, we have split the sample
the dollar apÛÜ Ýperiod

16

Gourinchas (1998) also studied the effect of the exchange rate on job creation and job destruction in U.S. manufacturing industries. He regressed job creation and job destruction on, among
other aggregate variables, the deviation of industry-specific log real exchange rates from their trend
values. Separate regressions were run on sectors identified as “traded goods sectors,” (which is
composed of the two groups “export sectors” and “import-competing sectors”) and “non-traded
goods sectors.” Gourinchas discards from his sample all 4-digit industries that do not consistently, over the entire sample, fit his definition of export, import-competing or non-traded. This
leaves him with 35 non-traded 4-digit industries and 68 traded 4-digit industries out of the initial 450 4-digit industries, a subsample with about 27 percent of the employment of the original
sample.

21

motivation for splitting the exchange rate movements into periods of appreciation and depreciation is data-based; in preliminary tests of our model we found
important asymmetries between the effects of exchange rate appreciation and depreciation. Possible reasons for these asymmetries are discussed in conjunction
with the regression results in the next section.
Our openness variable requires some explanation. Our intent in including this
variable is to capture heterogeneity across industries in the degree of response
to the real exchange rate. However, as we documented earlier, openness has increased sharply over time. To avoid confusing heterogeneity over industries with
the effects of increasing openness (or other trending variables), it is desirable to
use a detrended transformation of openness in the regressions. In constructing the
openness variable that we include in the regressions (  ), we start by calculating
the value of exports plus imports as proportion of total shipments (domestic sales
and exports) plus imports for each 4-digit manufacturing industry in each year. We
then transform that measure by dividing it by the mean value of openness over all
industries in the same year. This converts openness into a relative measure, which
has a mean (over all industries) equal to one in each year. We then calculate a
five- (previous) year moving average of the relative openness measure in order to
avoid short-term fluctuations in openness from having an undue influence on our
results. Although there is some variation over time in industries’ relative degree of
openness, the transition matrix results in Table 3 suggest that this is small relative
to the cross-sectional variance over industries.
Other measured variables that influence job creation and destruction are included in the  and   vectors. Vector  contains two aggregate variables: the
percentage rates of change in U.S. GDP and OECD GDP. Vector   contains the
percentage rates of change of variables that vary both over industries and over
time. These include the real price of shipments, the real price of energy inputs,
the real price of materials, and the real wages of production workers, all from the
NBER Productivity Database. Descriptive statistics for the variables included in
the regressions are displayed in Table 4.
The last three terms in equation 14, (  "! #%$   ), represent the effects of unmeasured influences on job creation and destruction at the industry, aggregate, and
time-varying industry levels. We specify & to be a fixed (non-stochastic) effect,
and treat !  and $   as stochastic. The presence of !  implies non-independence of
the regression error term across observations for any given year. Our estimated
standard errors correct for this.17

Regression Results

Results from estimation of the regressions implied by equation 14 are shown in
Table 5. The regressions were estimated using ordinary least squares, with nonindependence of the regression errors within years allowed for in computing the
standard errors.18 A full set of 4-digit industry fixed effects, '&( , were controlled
for in the estimation. This allows each industry to have different base, or normal,
rates of job creation and destruction. The point estimates are the sums of all lagged
coefficients (including contemporaneous values where used).
Two important asymmetries in the response of employment to movements in
the real exchange rate are apparent in the results. First, although job destruction
gate effects in panel regressions with aggregate regressors can result in substantial understatement

is sensitive to exchange rate movements, job creation is not. Second, the rate
of job destruction increases with an increase in the value of the dollar, but job
destruction does not decrease below normal levels when the dollar drops in value.
As expected based on our model, the degree of sensitivity of job destruction to
exchange rate movements increases with the degree of the industry’s exposure to
trade.19
We calculate the sensitivity of job destruction to an appreciation of the dollar
by adding to the coefficients on “appreciation” the product of the openness measure and the coefficient on “openness times appreciation.” The openness measure
is constructed such that its mean value equals 1 in each year. These results reflect
sensitivity of job destruction to the real exchange rate; an industry with an average
degree of openness will, on average and all else equal, experience a ,.- /#0 percentage point increase in job destruction for each percentage point of appreciation.
Recall that it is not unusual to have a 1 , percent appreciation rate in a given year
and, in those years, we estimate that a typical industry experiences an almost 2
percentage point increase in job destruction due to the appreciation.
These results also reflect an important role for dollar appreciation in generating
heterogeneous job destruction rates across industries. For example, the value of
the relative openness measure for the lower quartile of industries is ,.- 3 / for the
period 1974 to 1993, while the value of openness for the upper quartile over the
same period is 14- / 5 . These differences translate to estimated partial derivatives
of job destruction with respect to an appreciation of 1 percentage point in the
real exchange rate of ,#- /#142 and ,#- 2 , 6 , respectively, values even larger and more
significant than the partial derivatives with respect to U.S. GDP. Thus, a firm at the
upper quartile of openness will have a 5 5 percent larger increase in job destruction
than a firm at the lower quartile of openness, all else equal.
The asymmetry between the responsiveness of job creation and job destruction
has been found in other contexts as well. In particular, job destruction is much
more sensitive to business cycle conditions than is job creation. Thus, one possiof the standard errors associated with those regressors; see Kloeck (1981) or Moulton(1990).
18
Estimation of the same equations using an error components model allowing for random year
effects in computing the regression coefficients produces very similar results.
19
Gourinchas (1998), using a different framework and a smaller set of industries (see footnote
16), finds a significant response of both job destruction and job creation to the real exchange rate.
Surprisingly, he finds job creation and job destruction move significantly in the same direction in
response to a given exchange rate change. The standard errors he reports, however, do not control
for the possibly high covariance of industry exchange rates when calculating standard errors (see
Moulton 1990).

25

ble explanation for the results in Table 5 is that exchange rate movements represent aggregate shocks that trigger asymmetric creation and destruction responses
because of underlying microeconomic nonlinearities in employment adjustment
behavior.20
An alternative explanation of the asymmetry between the responsiveness of
job creation and destruction is that, at the plant level, job creation may respond to
shocks with a longer and more variable time lag than does job destruction.21 Employees can be discharged nearly immediately after a firm has determined that it is
optimal to do so, but expanding employment often requires considerable planning,
screening of new employees, installation of new equipment, and sometimes erection of new structures. Furthermore, there may be fixed costs, periods of learning,
and other barriers to entering foreign markets or expanding one’s presence abroad.
Because of these potential delays, it may be difficult to detect the response of job
creation to a change in the real exchange rate even if the response does exist.
The coefficients on most of the other variables are not statistically significant.
An exception is the growth rate of the price of the industry’s shipments, which is
significant in both the job creation and job destruction regressions. An increase in
the real price of shipments, which one would expect to increase industry profits,
increases job creation and reduces job destruction.
The last column of the table shows the result of regressing net employment
change on the independent variables or, equivalently, the result of subtracting the
job destruction coefficients from the job creation coefficients. The exchange rate
coefficients in this column are largely driven by the coefficients from the job destruction regression. This illustrates the importance of analyzing job creation and
destruction, rather than just net changes in employment. The “net employment
change” column shows that an appreciation of the dollar results in a large and
statistically significant reduction in employment. But it misses the important fact
that the main way in which this is achieved is through an increase in job destruction, with relatively little contemporaneous change in job creation. The reason
this fact is important is that changes in job destruction are likely to have more
serious effects on wages and unemployment rates.
In estimating the regressions reported in Table 5, all industries were given
equal weight, regardless of their size. If the true population regression coefficients vary over industries in a way not completely captured by the interaction

We control for lags by including both contemporaneous and lagged values of the annual percentage changes in the real exchange rate in job creation and job destruction regressions.

between the exchange rate change variables and openness, then using the coefficients in Table 5 to forecast the aggregate changes in job creation and destruction
due to a change in the real exchange rate will produce biased estimates. To gauge
the potential importance of this problem, and to probe the robustness of our results, we reestimated the regressions weighting each industry observation by its
employment size. The results from this exercise are reported in Table 6. The differences between Tables 5 and 6 are relatively minor. In particular, the responses
of job creation and destruction to changes in the real exchange rate are similar in
the two sets of regressions.
The results in Table 6 can be used to estimate the overall effect in the manufacturing sector of a change in the value of the dollar. For example, as stated
earlier, the dollar appreciated from 1982 to 1986 at an annual rate of 7.8 9 percent
per year. The estimates in Table 6 suggest that, over this period, the appreciation of the dollar was responsible for an increase in the job destruction rate of

of openness
One possible reason we do not find that job destruction is sensitive to the
exchange rate in years when there was a depreciation may be that the dollar was
quite high relative to historical values during its steep depreciation after the mid
1980s. Although some firms likely responded to the depreciation by decreasing
their rate of job destruction at that time, others may have continued to destroy
jobs at a faster than normal rate because of the high value of the dollar. The
asymmetry between the effects of exchange rate appreciations and depreciations
in the regression results shown in Tables 5 and 6 may reflect a role for the level of
the exchange rate relative to its long-run equilibrium value in determining rates of
job creation and destruction.
To investigate this hypothesis, we estimated regressions in which the exchange
rate change variables were replaced by the log-level of the exchange rate (F GIH+J ).
The log-level of the exchange rate coefficient can be interpreted as showing the
effect of deviations of the exchange rate from its equilibrium value, with the equilibrium value being incorporated into the constant term and random year effects.
The results of estimating the new specification, which are shown in Table 7,
are broadly consistent with the earlier specification. As before, the real exchange
rate affects job destruction but not job creation. Rates of job destruction will be

greater than normal in years in which the exchange rate is above its equilibrium
value. However, in the new specification the effect of the real exchange rate on job
destruction does not vary significantly with the degree of the industry’s openness
to trade.
The robustness of the results were further checked by including the log-level
of the exchange rate as an additional regressor in our earlier specification.22 In
this case, in the job destruction regression the log-level of the exchange rate is
positive and sizable, but statistically insignificant; the change in the real exchange
rate is positive and significant for years in which the dollar appreciated and small
and insignificant for years in which the dollar depreciated. Thus, while we can
say with some confidence that an appreciation of the exchange rate results in an
increased rate of job destruction, the role of the exchange rate level is not entirely
clear. In addition, we are not able to resolve why a depreciation of the exchange
rate does not result in a decreased rate of job destruction.

5 Conclusion
Movements in the real exchange rate have a substantial impact on the rate at which
manufacturing jobs are destroyed. Specifically, we have shown that an appreciation of the dollar results in an increased rate of job destruction, with the largest increase coming in the most open industries. We do not find statistically significant
evidence that dollar depreciation is associated with lower rates of job destruction,
all else equal. Also, job creation seems to be little affected by exchange rate
movements.
The welfare implications of this result are unclear. Many of the jobs destroyed
when the dollar appreciates are likely to have been only marginally profitable, and
may have been slated for eventual elimination even if the exchange rate remained
stable. However, the timing of job destruction does have an impact on the welfare
of displaced workers. Workers are likely to have an easier time finding suitable
reemployment when job destruction is gradual and diffuse than when an external
shock causes job destruction to spike and, consequently, a glut of displaced workers are searching for new jobs simultaneously. For this reason, acceleration of
job destruction caused by a temporary appreciation of the exchange rate can have
adverse consequences on economic welfare. Further research will be needed to
quantify this effect.

We have documented that the importance of trade in U.S. manufacturing has
increased tremendously, along relatively idiosyncratic lines. Most of the variation
in openness to trade is within, rather than between, major industry groups. Over
time, the greatest increase in openness to trade has been in the industries that
initially were most open. An interesting extension of this research would be to
model the factors that underlie why particular 4-digit industries are much more
open than are other industries in the same 2- or 3-digit industry group.
