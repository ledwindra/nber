The Consumption Terms of Trade and Commodity Prices
Martin Berka and Mario J. Crucini
NBER Working Paper No. 15580
December 2009
JEL No. F0
ABSTRACT
The national terms of trade, defined as the ratio of an export price index to an import price index has
been extensively studied empirically. In this paper we construct an alternative measure, which we
call the consumption terms of trade. This measure recognizes the fact that consumers and firms face
different prices for the same items and consume different items. Using micro-data from the Economist
Intelligence Unit at the retail level, we conduct a forensic analysis of the variation of the terms of trade
of 38 countries. Using a novel variance decomposition method, we find that the bulk of terms of trade
variation is accounted for by oil, automobiles and medicine. The other goods in our construct tend
to exhibit balanced trade, providing a natural hedge against world price fluctuations. We find the consumption
terms of trade at local prices is more volatile than at world prices, but the two are strongly positively
correlated. The same commodities dominate the variance decomposition in both constructs, but variance
shifts from oil to medicine, when local prices are used, presumably due to larger LOP deviations in
the latter than the former. The significant differences in time paths of producer (conventional) and
consumer terms of trade suggests the need to adapt the elasticities approach to trade balance adjustment
to recognize different prices and baskets at the consumer and producer level.

emphasize the role of productivity movements across the United States and
Europe, with each assumed to specialize in a manufactured product. In
their model an increase in domestic productivity expands output at home
relative to output abroad and the terms of trade deteriorates. Simply put: a
large country expanding the supply of the traded good it produces must (in
equilibrium) drive down the relative price of its products on world markets.
The importing country’s terms of trade improves, a positive spillover. Backus
and Crucini (2000) add a third region to this model; a region that specializes
in oil production. When the oil region cuts back production, the relative
price of oil rises, improving the terms of trade of oil producers. Output falls
in the United States and Europe because oil is an intermediate input in the
production of manufactured goods. The business cycle implications of this
model are consistent with empirical work by Hamilton (1983) showing oil
price increases are leading indicators of U.S. recessions.

Mendoza (1995)

studies the terms of trade and business cycles in an extensive cross-country
panel using a partial equilibrium business cycle model where terms of trade
movements are exogenous. In his theoretical setting, terms of trade shocks are
analogous to lotteries with the sign and magnitude of the payout dependent
upon a country’s pattern of specialization across an array of internationally
traded goods.
Three features handicap the practical value of most theoretical models of
the terms of trade, including those mentioned above. First, the models have
too few countries. In the two country model, it must be true that at least
2

one of the two trading partners is large enough to alter its terms of trade.
In practice, countries with this amount of market power are in the minority.
Even more problematic is the fact that the terms of trade of the two countries
are perfectly negatively correlated with one another since one is the inverse
of the other. In contrast, the terms of trade of net oil importers tend to correlate positively with each other and negatively with those of oil exporters,
particularly during periods of volatile oil prices. Second, the models have
too few goods. Adding countries that specialize in production means adding
goods as well. This makes the aggregate terms of trade a blunt instrument
for identifying the underlying sources of terms of trade movements. This is
why the empirical literature tends to focus on less-aggregated measures of the
terms of trade, at a minimum: energy and non-energy components. Third,
most international trade is …rm-to-…rm or intra-…rm (e.g. a multinational
purchasing parts from a foreign subsidiary) involving intermediate inputs.
In contrast, consumers purchase most of the items they consume from retailers in local markets. It may be more appropriate to think of producers
and consumers interacting in segmented markets that are part of a larger
equilibrium process.
This paper conducts a forensic analysis of the sources of terms of trade
variation of 38 countries, over the period 1990 to 2005. What makes our
analysis forensic is the use of micro-price data from the Economist Intelligence Unit to parse the variance of the aggregate terms of trade into the
contributions of individual goods. The micro-price data in conjunction with
3

trade shares helps us isolate the source of a nation’s terms of trade variation in the space of goods. Knowledge of trade shares and economic clout
of countries or regions in export markets provides indirect evidence on the
national origins of terms of trade shocks (OPEC’s role in the oil market, for
example).
The use of retail prices in our terms of trade construct is non-standard. It
is intended to distinguish between relative prices of traded goods faced by a
nation’s consumers from the more conventional de…nition using trade prices
at the border. We refer to these constructs as the consumption terms of trade
and the production terms of trade, respectively. Conceptually, the consumption terms of trade is the relative price that motivates shifts in consumption
demand between the home export and imports while the production terms
of trade is the relative price that in‡uences resource allocation across the
export and import-competing sectors.
If producers and consumers face the same prices for imported and exported goods, the consumption and production terms of trade are equal and
a common terms of trade prevails. Improvements in the terms of trade motivate domestic producers to shift resources toward the production of exports
and away from imports, with consumption shifting in the opposite direction.
When the terms of trade in consumption di¤ers from the terms of trade in
production, the consumption, production and trade balance implications are
altered in fundamental ways. Yet before these implications can be understood, we need to know how much the consumption and production terms of
4

trade di¤er and understand the underlying sources of those di¤erences.
The analysis begins with the study of commodity-level retail price in‡ation and price level in‡ation for the world as a whole. This is accomplished
by averaging U.S. dollar prices of individual goods and services across as
many cities as available in the Economist Intelligence Unit retail price survey, the source of our consumer price data. The standard deviations of these
commodity-level in‡ation rates range from a low of 3.7% to a high of 11%;
the median is about 5%. Averaging these global price in‡ation rates across
goods and services provides our world in‡ation estimate, which turns out to
have a correlation of 0.88 with the o¢ cial OECD, U.S. dollar world in‡ation rate. This high correlation is surprising given the EIU sample typically
comprises only one city per country and uses a di¤erent consumption basket
than o¢ cial estimates. It is also reassuring in the sense that the estimate
appears not to be systematically biased by these di¤erences. Next, a variance decomposition of world in‡ation is performed where the contribution of
each good’s in‡ation to aggregate world in‡ation is estimated. Prices with
relatively high variation and positive comovement with other prices in the
basket will contribute more to aggregate in‡ation variability for the same
reasons that high beta stocks contribute more than their portfolio weight to
the variance of a stock price index. Individual items are found to contribute
vastly di¤erent amounts to price level variability. Some of the usual suspects
show up at the upper end of the distribution, such as fuels, but individual
food items often display annual changes not unlike that of fuel.
5

Qualita-

tively, what we see is analogous to what is already known at the national
level: food and energy prices are more volatile than the typical item found
in the consumption basket.
The world price series at the microeconomic level form the basis of our
benchmark computations of the consumption terms of trade at world prices.
Using micro-data on trade ‡ows we construct import and export price indices
by weighting world prices (constructed from the EIU micro-data) by national
import and export trade shares. The ratio of the export price index to the
import price index is the terms of trade estimate. The consumption terms of
trade is somewhat less volatile than the production terms of trade in levels.
However, this di¤erence is nil in growth rates, when averages across the panel
of 38 countries are taken. As is true of the production terms of trade, the
variability of the consumption terms of trade di¤ers vastly across countries,
from a low of about 1% in Australia to a high of about 10% in Korea (in
levels).

Countries with high production terms of trade variability tend to

have high consumption terms of trade variability in log-levels, but this is not
true of growth rates. The correlation of the two measures within a country
averages 0.3 for log-levels and 0.4 for growth rates. The two measures, then,
are conceptually and empirically distinct.
Decompositions of the aggregate consumption terms of trade into microeconomic sources of variation at the good level is telling. The bulk of the
variability for most countries in the sample is accounted for by oil, automobiles and medicine. The role of oil in the production terms of trade has been
6

extensively studied in the existing literature, the evidence here suggests that
this feature extends to the consumption level. The fact that one need not
go beyond a few key items to account for virtually all of the terms of trade
variance is a more novel …nding. Focusing on oil, automobiles and medicine
accounts for much of the secular swing in the consumption terms of trade
over the 1990 to 2005 period in our panel. Interesting, oil moves in an idiosyncratic fashion relative to other world prices, helping to further distinguish
its role beyond its very skewed trade shares internationally.
Movements in key world prices allow a classi…cation of 30 of the 38 countries into two groups, 10 countries with U-shaped terms of trade pro…les (7 of
these are oil exporters) and 20 countries with inverted U-shaped patterns (all
are oil importers). With few exceptions, patterns outside these two groups
and subtle di¤erences within the groups are elucidated by looking at di¤erences in the relative importance of oil, automobiles and medicine. Ireland,
for example, experiences virtual continuous improvements in the consumption terms of trade due to the pull of medicine prices on the export side
serving as an e¤ective counterweight to the drag of oil prices on the import
side.
The analysis highlights the fact that what determines the marginal contribution of a good to terms of trade variability is a country’s net trade
share in that good or sector. Due to the extensive volume of intra-industry
trade among most industrialized countries, the bulk of terms of trade risk
associated with world price movements is mostly hedged via balanced trade.
7

Isolating the sources of variation then, requires the variance decomposition
method developed here which hinges on the use of micro-price data.
The …nal section of the paper constructs the consumption terms of trade
at local prices using local retail prices to measure the import and export
prices rather than world prices. The trade weights remain the same as in
the benchmark case. This allows LOP deviations to in‡uence the terms of
trade. As one would expect, the terms of trade using local prices is typically more volatile than when world prices are used. However, the di¤erence
is surprisingly modest because the LOP deviations which distinguish world
prices from local prices tend to average out across goods. The redistribution
of the attribution of terms of trade variance across goods while notable, is
also modest. Mostly the contribution of oil falls while that of medicine rises.
This shift makes intuitive sense since international LOP deviations are plausibly larger for medicine than oil. This is not to say that LOP deviations
are unimportant in a more general sense. Our focus on the terms of trade
means we ignore most of the service sector entirely. The prices of services
are known to exhibit larger and more persistent deviations from LOP than
are the prices of traded goods. It may also be true that LOP deviations for
services fail to average out across items to the extent found among traded
goods, contributing to greater volatility in the aggregate real exchange rate
than the consumption terms of trade.

The Terms of Trade

Consider the production terms of trade constructed as a constant-shareweighted average of the logarithms of export and import prices.

where pxij;t is the free-on-board price of good i exported from country j, at
date t and pm
ij;t is the price inclusive of insurance and freight imported into
country j.

These prices are denominated in U.S. dollars throughout the

paper. The export and import shares are, ij and ! ij , respectively and are
PM
PM

assumed to satisfy:
ij
i=1 ! ij = 1 . The i index is used on both
i=1
the import and export side to account for the fact that countries may import

and export the same good, or at least goods that are di¢ cult to distinguish
given the published data. The summation should be thought of as being
taken over the union of all goods appearing on the export and import side
of the nation’s income and product accounts with many goods entering with
a zero trade weight on one side of the trade balance or the other.
Our primary interest is a more novel concept, the consumption terms
of trade. The trade weights remain the same, but prices at the border are
replaced with retail prices. The benchmark is the case in which the LOP
holds across retail markets in all countries, for each good, in which case the
consumption terms of trade is given by:
c
qj;t
=

XM

i=1

(

ij

9

! ij )pi;t .

(2)

where pi;t will be computed as the average U.S. dollar price of good i, across
all locations. For obvious reasons, this is de…ned as the consumption terms
of trade at world prices. Note the strong implication of the assumption of
common prices in all locations. The consumption terms of trade of each
country is simply a di¤erent geometric weighted average of a common vector
of world prices. Put di¤erently: the world price vector forms a common basis
for determining all price indices and relative prices of interest. The key insight
of this level of detail is that goods in which a country has balanced trade will
not contribute to the variance of the terms of trade. For example, if a country
imports oil and exports coal, commodities that produce energy demanded by
consumers, energy is not going to be a large part of what determines variation
in that nation’s terms of trade if the country has balanced trade in energy.
In the penultimate section of the paper this measure is compared to the
consumption terms of trade at local prices.

Note: the trade shares are the same as before, but the prices are now retail
prices paid by …nal consumers in country j, not world average prices. Note
that while the exports and imports of good i have the same price in the
home retail market, the retail prices of these same goods may di¤er across
countries for various reasons.
The two measures of the terms of trade may be easily contrasted, as

where qij;t = (pij;t pi;t ). In words: the consumption terms of trade of country
j at local prices equals the consumption terms of trade of country j at world
prices plus the net-trade-share-weighted average of the LOP deviations of
country j where those deviations are computed relative to the world average
price of each good, i.

The data

The source of the retail price data is the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Survey of Retail Prices. The sample period runs from 1990 until 2005
and spans 123 cities and 301 goods and services. As these data have now
been quite extensively used elsewhere, our description is brief.1 The value of
these data in this application is that the basket contains the same items in all
cities, which contrasts signi…cantly with the practice of National Statistical
Agencies where the focus is on the goods typically consumed in a particular
city.

While one implication of this is that we may not match the o¢ cial

CPI in‡ation of a city, an advantage is that we are not averaging prices
of di¤erent goods across locations, which would not provide a meaningful
estimate of world-wide commodity level in‡ation at the microeconomic level.
The supplemental data we use includes very disaggregated import and export
1

See for example, Crucini and Shintani (2008), Frankel, Parsley and Wei (2008) and
Rogers (2008).

11

shares and o¢ cial terms of trade data.
To ensure reasonably broad coverage of the consumption basket only locations with at least 200 retail prices is included in the analysis. This restriction limits our sample to 82 of the 123 available cities, including 55 cities
in 28 OECD countries and 27 non-OECD locations. These include 13 cities
in the USA, 5 in Australia and Germany, 4 in Canada, 2 in each Japan,
Spain, France, Italy, Switzerland and New Zealand. The non-OECD locations include 5 cities in 3 oil-exporting countries, 9 Asian and Latin-American
countries each, and 3 African countries.
Products whose prices are used in the construction of our terms of trade
measure account for 21.1% of the expenditure found in the US CPI basket.
Given that the consumption share of tradables in the U.S. CPI is only about
31.8%, these products account for 66% of the tradables in the U.S. consumption basket. In terms of CPI sub-indices, coverage rates are: 93% for clothing,
72% for alcoholic beverages, 70% for food at home, 61% for transportation
goods, 40% for personal care products, 24% for household furnishings and
19% for recreation goods.
Our trade shares are drawn from the UN Comtrade database. Speci…cally,
the 6-digit 2002 Harmonized System of import and export volumes in U.S.
dollars for the year 2007. Each good in the EIU retail price survey is matched
to one of these 6-digit trade volumes. The sample includes members of the
OECD, China, Brazil, Russia, India, several major oil exporting countries
and Asian exporters. Among these countries, our retail price data cover
12

and average of 19% of imports and 18% of exports (we do not include reexports or re-imports). The primary reason these numbers are not higher
is that much of international trade is in intermediate goods, whereas retail
purchases are mostly …nal goods. The import coverage ratios reach up to
30% for Greece, but are as low as 6% for Singapore, which seems due to the
paucity of electronic goods in the EIU survey in the latter case. The export
coverage ratios range between 77% for Saudi Arabia and 3.5% for Singapore.

World in‡ation

Recall, our estimate of the consumption terms of trade at world prices requires estimates of world price series by good. The commodity-level in‡ation
estimates are in‡ation rates, in U.S. dollars, of a particular good, i,

pi;t ,

averaged across all available cities in the EIU sample, indexed by j,
pi;t = N

N
X

pij;t .

(5)

j=1

The number of locations varies somewhat across goods. We restrict the
sample of locations to those with at least 200 price observations.
Aggregate world in‡ation (again, in the units of the numeraire currency,
the U.S. dollar) is the average across commodities of these in‡ation rates,
1 X
pi;t .
pt =
84 i=1
84

(6)

The use of equal weights may be justi…ed theoretically by the zero degree
homogeneity of demand functions in which case the interpretation is that our
aggregate price level is a numeraire, not a price index.
13

Figure 1 presents the in‡ation series for each of the 84 goods used to
estimate world in‡ation while Figure 2 presents the aggregate in‡ation rate,
the left-hand-side of the expression. The common in‡ation factor across
goods is obvious from visual inspection of Figure 1, further con…rmed by the
fact that the median correlation of in‡ation at the good and aggregate level
is a remarkable 0.92.
World in‡ation averaged 1.7% over the sample period (1991 to 2005).
Two years exhibited signi…cant de‡ation, 1997 (-6.0%) and 2000 (-7.6%),
while in‡ation was very high in 1994 (6.9%), 2003 (8.6%) and 2005 (6.8%).
The correlation of this in‡ation measure with the o¢ cial estimate of OECD
in‡ation in U.S. dollars is 0.88.
To more fully understand the role of individual prices in the evolution of
the aggregate in‡ation rate we use the portfolio-inspired variance decomposition used by Crucini and Landry (2009) to study the microeconomic sources
of aggregate real exchange rate variation. The variance of aggregate in‡ation may be expressed in terms of the covariance of aggregate in‡ation and
good-level in‡ation:
1 X
cov( pi;t ; pt ) .
var( pt ) =
84 i=1
84

(7)

Dividing through by the variance of aggregate in‡ation gives the variance
decomposition:
1 X
84 i=1
84

1=

i

.

(8)

The decomposition centers the distribution of the contributions of good-level
14

in‡ation to aggregate in‡ation variability, the average beta, at unity. Thus,
the average good contributes its weight to the total variance, 1=84. Goods
with betas exceeding unity contribute more than the average good while
goods with betas less than unity contribute less. Since beta can be negative,
a commodity may reduce aggregate in‡ation variability. The interpretation
is that adding such a price to the commodity basket will reduce the variance
of the aggregate in‡ation rate. As it turns out, no commodity-level in‡ation
in the micro-sample has a negative covariance with the world in‡ation level,
the lowest beta is 0.56.
The betas may alternatively be expressed in terms of the standard deviation of commodity-level in‡ation relative to aggregate in‡ation multiplied
by the sample correlation of the two:

i

=

i

corr( pi;t ; pt )

(9)

Figure 3, plots kernel density estimates relating to this decomposition. The
upper-left chart is the kernel estimate of the standard deviation of in‡ation
across goods, it ranges from about 3.75% to about 8.68% (see also Table 1).
There is considerable central tendency of commodity-level in‡ation near the
level of aggregate in‡ation variability, 4.75%. The upper-right panel is the
relative standard deviation, one component that in‡uences how individual
goods contribute to aggregate in‡ation variability. The values range from a
low of 0.79 to a high of 1.83.
The lower-left panel is the estimated distribution of the betas, the dis15

tribution of the contributions of commodity level in‡ation to the variance of
aggregate in‡ation. These average to 1 by construction, but vary considerably across goods, from a low of 0.56 for oil to a high of 1.45 for lettuce. It
may seem surprising that oil contributes the least to world in‡ation variability, given the attention oil prices draw in discussions of monetary policy. The
conventional wisdom that oil is among the most variable prices is valid, even
at the retail level: it ranks fourth among the 84 commodities in our in‡ation
construct. What sets oil apart is that it has the lowest correlation with the
aggregate in‡ation level of any commodity in our sample, at 0.35. The median correlation of good-level in‡ation with aggregate in‡ation is 0.92. The
…nal chart is a kernel estimate of the correlation of commodity-level in‡ation
with the aggregate in‡ation rate.

The consumption terms of trade

Recall, the consumption terms of trade at world prices is de…ned as:
qj;t =

X84

i=1

(

ij

! ij )pi;t .

(10)

Figures 4 and 5 present a comparison of our estimate of the U.S. consumption
terms of trade and the conventional production terms of trade as well as the
import and export price indices used in the construction of each. Because
the o¢ cial data is available quarterly but our retail price data is annual, we
present a …gure with the original o¢ cial data as well as a version where we
take quarterly averages to make them more comparable to our estimates.
16

Each …gure contains four charts, the left-most charts are the terms of trade,
the di¤erences between the two lines in the right-hand-charts, which contain
the import and export price indices.
The U.S. consumption terms of trade displays a distinctive secular swing
over from 1990 to 2005. This is true of 10 of the 12 cases for which we have
both measures of the terms of trade (not shown). The most frequent pattern,
found in 6 of 12 cases, Finland, France, Italy, Korea, Netherlands and the
U.S. is an inverted U-shape, with terms of trade improvements followed by
deterioration.

Four are reversed, U-shaped patterns (Australia, Canada,

Denmark and New Zealand), with the terms of trade deteriorating during
the …rst half of the sample and then improving in the second half. Two terms
of trade measures exhibit virtual continuous improvement (Switzerland and
United Kingdom).

We will explore these striking similarities in the next

section.
Turning to the production terms of trade, the relative price of exports
to imports using prices at the border, the patterns share similarities and
di¤erences to the consumption terms of trade. The distinctive U-shapes
and inverted U-shapes are largely gone. Denmark, the Netherlands, New
Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom show general terms of trade
improvements.

Canada and Australia maintain some of their original U-

shaped paths. Finland, Korea and Italy have deteriorating terms of trade
over much of the sample. The picture for France is ambiguous, due to low
variability. The United States has a somewhat inverted U-shape (see Figure
17

4 or 5), but the timing is di¤erent from what the consumption terms of trade
shows.
Table 2 reports standard deviations of log-level and growth rates for both
terms of trade measures, as well as their contemporaneous correlation. The
production terms of trade tend to be more volatile than the consumption
terms of trade, though this di¤erence largely disappears in the move to
growth rates, where the average standard deviation in the production terms
of trade is 2.3, compared to 2.4 for the consumption terms of trade. Thus,
the di¤erences between the two is not merely less volatile prices at the retail
level than at the border. The two measures move weakly together in loglevels, where the correlation is about 0.3, on average, and somewhat more
strongly in growth rates, where the correlation is 0.4, on average.
Since the production and consumption terms of trade are di¤erent conceptually, it is not clear that a high correlation between them is to be expected.
Moreover, the construction of the consumption terms of trade uses average
international retail prices, while the terms of trade uses prices at the customs
point of entry or exit of each country. Given that deviations from the LOP
have been widely documented in the literature, this is another source of difference between the two measures. The role of LOP deviations is evaluated
in the penultimate section of the paper. The question we turn to next is:
what is generating the trends and ‡uctuations in the consumption terms of
trade? As was noted earlier, there appear to be a few common secular trends
shared by certain groups of countries. It will be interesting to see if those
18

common features are driven by trade patterns and particular properties of a
few key international prices, such as the price of oil.

5.1

Variance decomposition

The variance of a nation’s terms of trade satis…es the following equation:
1 X
var(qj;t ) =
(
84 i=1
84

ij

! ij )cov(qj;t ; pi;t ) .

(11)

Dividing both sides by the variance of the terms of trade, gives the variance
decomposition:
1 X
(
1=
84 i=1
84

ij

! ij )

i;j

,

(12)

The betas are e¤ectively the coe¢ cients from a regression of the commoditylevel price on the consumption terms of trade

i;j

= cov(qj;t ; pi;t )=var(qj;t ).

The analysis starts by pulling back to the broadest picture, pooling all
good and locations. Figure 6 plots two kernel density estimates, one for the
net trade share and the other for the betas. These two distributions contain
all of the elements needed to decompose the variance of the terms of trade.
The net trade shares lie almost exclusively between plus and minus 5%.
Recall, these are normalized so that for each country the import shares (and
export shares) sum to unity. The net trade shares for oil are extreme outliers, averaging 40% across countries, while various categories of cars have an
absolute net trade share that averages about 30%. Not surprisingly, these
items will exert a disproportionately large in‡uence on the terms of trade.
The beta distribution lies mostly between plus and minus 3, with a strong
central tendency toward the mean of about 0.25. Since the contribution to
19

variance is the product of the net trade share and beta, values in the tail of
the distribution are what dominate the variance decomposition of the terms
of trade. To see this more clearly, it is productive to look to the details of
the distribution of products of the net import share and beta: (

ij

! ij )

i;j .

Figure 7 plots the contributions to variance, the product of the net trade
share and beta, for each commodity and country in our sample. Since there
are 84 commodities and 38 countries, there are 3,192 values plotted in this
…gure. The upper panel orders the contributions by commodity and the lower
panel orders the contributions by country. In the upper panel, the vertical
red lines mark the variance contributions by good with points between the
lines denoting a country-speci…c variance contribution for that good. In the
lower panel, the vertical red lines mark variance contribution by country
with points between the lines denoting good-speci…c variance contributions
for that country. The variance contributions organized by country will sum
to unity within each interval by construction.
The clusters of extreme values in the upper chart identify commodities
that contribute considerably more to terms of trade variation than the typical
item. To see this more clearly, Figure 8 focuses on the seven most important
contributors to consumption terms of trade variability. In order of ascending
importance, they are: pullovers; boneless beef; luxury, compact and large
cars; medicine and oil. The contribution from oil averages 0.6. In other
words, oil alone accounts for about 60% of the variation in the terms of trade
when we average across our 38 nations. Medicine accounts for about 12%
20

of terms of trade variation, the three automobile categories combined are
comparable at 11%, while pullovers and boneless beef each account for about
2%. To place these numbers in perspective, the next 20 items in the ranking
combine to account for the same percentage as medicine. The reader should
keep in mind that the composition of in‡uences di¤ers across countries, which
is masked by the cross-country averaging discussed here. The cross-country
di¤erences in the contribution of each commodity is visible in the variation
within the commodity partitions of Figure 8.

5.2

Goods prices and the terms of trade

Based on the variance analysis (displayed in Figure 8), it seems su¢ cient
to focus on the time paths of the U.S. dollar prices of the items found to
be most in‡uential in the evolution of the aggregate consumption terms of
trade: oil, automobiles and medicine. Figure 9 plots the U.S. dollar prices of
these …ve goods.
Two features of these price histories are worth emphasizing. The …rst is
that oil prices have a large idiosyncratic component: the other four series
track each other very closely. This is consistent with the earlier decomposition of the variance of world in‡ation: the median correlation of good-level
and aggregate in‡ation is 0.92, while the correlation of oil in‡ation with world
in‡ation is a mere 0.35.
The second striking feature of Figure 9 is that oil prices are not much
more variable than the typical commodity price in these data. This is a

21

re‡ection of two facets of our analysis. First, the fact that we use prices paid
by …nal consumers rather than prices determined in commodity exchanges
such as the Chicago Board of Trade. Thus our ‘oil’price is a retail fuel price,
not the price of a barrel of crude petroleum. The former is much less volatile
than the latter at annual frequencies, in most time periods. Second, we use
micro-data which highlights the fact the retail prices do move around a great
deal and the aggregate CPI index tends to obscure this by averaging away
much of the idiosyncratic variation. Thus retail prices are much more volatile
than the price level, which is more familiar to macroeconomists.
The distinctive paths of these prices along with their dominate contribution to the terms of trade variance for the median country, already documented, suggests a convenient link between the aggregate consumption terms
of trade and a few key prices. In a nutshell, countries with net positive exposure to oil (net exporters) should have an inverted U-shaped terms of trade
path, following the path of oil’s price while those with a net negative exposure in oil and positive exposure in medicine or automobiles should have a
U-shaped pattern, following the evolution of these other prices.
To document this as clearly as possible the terms of trade is built up in
stages, beginning with the oil terms of trade, then adding medicine, then
automobiles and …nally, everything else, to arrive at the aggregate consumption terms of trade. Figures 10 through 13 do precisely this for each of the
38 countries in our sample. Figure 10 focuses on the eight oil exporters in
our panel: Canada, Denmark, Mexico, Norway, Russia, Saudi Arabia, United
22

Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. Figures 11 to 13 focus on the thirty
oil net-importers.
The terms of trade for oil is, by de…nition, just the path of oil prices
at the retail level (with 1990 = 0, the base year), scaled by the net trade
share in fuel.2 Thus, the dashed red lines in all …gures are either perfectly
positively correlated with the world price of oil (for net exporters) or perfectly
negatively correlated with the world price of oil (for net importers). If this
was the complete picture, net exporters would experience a secular decline in
their terms of trade followed by a secular rise, due to oil’s price movements –
a U-shaped pattern. For net importers, we would see an inverted U-shaped
terms of trade pro…le. Moreover, the red dashed lines (oil terms of trade)
and the solid black lines (overall terms of trade), would be the same.
While, this is, of course an over-simpli…cation, it is the case that oil dominates the secular movements in almost every case, with net exporters of oil
having U-shaped terms of trade (Figure 10) and net importers of oil tending
toward an inverted U-shaped terms of trade (Figures 11 to 13). The pattern
among net importers of oil is more complex than this stylized description,
partly because their trade patterns are more complex on both the export and
import side. Oil exporters, in contrast tend to be concentrated on the export
side and less concentrated on the import side. For them, complexity lies on
the import side of the ledger, for the most part.
2

The net fuel share is zero for Hong Kong, Iceland and Luxembourg. Thus, for these
three the oil terms of trade is constant, re‡ecting a perfect hedge.

23

In most of the oil importing countries, the terms of trade in oil is the
lower envelope of the other terms of trade constructs. What prevents the
overall terms of trade from behaving similarly is that other items are fueling
improvements at the same time oil is sapping the fuel. Perhaps the clearest
examples of this is Ireland (Figure 12) where oil prices contribute to terms of
trade deterioration over the last third of the sample, but this is completely
swamped by the improvements in the terms of trade in medicine. Moreover,
during the …rst third of the sample medicine and oil prices are moving in
the same direction, reinforcing the improving trend in Ireland’s terms of
trade.

Automobiles, a net import, are a drag on Ireland’s terms of trade

more signi…cant even than oil (comparing the green and blue dashed lines of
Figure 12). However, medicine is su¢ cient to keep the Irish terms of trade
rising on trend for almost the entire sample period.
Korea is an even clearer case in point as a major oil importer and automobile exporter, only two lines are visible, medicine and other goods play
no role (this is not to say other goods are individually unimportant, as they
may average out across goods). Automobile price increases buoyed Korea’s
terms of trade until the last third of the sample when oil prices rose relative
to automobile prices. Israel is a case were oil is a signi…cant terms of trade
drag, but automobiles and medicine are not helpful in accounting for the
terms of trade, here exploration of the sources of variation would need to go
beyond these three items.

5.3

The consumption terms of trade at local prices

Up to this point we have maintained that the LOP price holds for retail
prices. However, a large literature emphasizes that LOP deviations are large
and persistent, particularly so when consumer prices are the focus. The
consumption terms of trade at local prices allows for these deviations:

Figure 14 presents a scatterplot of qej;t
against qj;t
pooling all cities and time

periods. The blue dots are levels while the red dots are changes. The corre-

lation of the two is 0.59 in levels and 0.45 in changes, when all locations and
time periods are pooled together. As expected, the variability of the terms
of trade is generally higher when local prices are used as is evident in the
increase in time series variance from 3.28 to 5.62 for the median country in
levels and from 2.69 to 4.68 for growth rates.
Allowing for LOP deviations matters for some countries more than others.
To see the heterogeneity across countries, Table 3 reports the correlation of
the two terms of trade measures for each country. The median correlation
is 0.60, which turns out to be Finland; the range of correlations is very
wide, from -0.62 for Hong Kong to 0.91 for the USA. When we examine the
decomposition of the variance across goods, the reasons for the di¤erences at
the aggregate level will become clear.
Toward this end, consider how the variance of the terms of trade gets
distributed across goods based on our methodology. Taking the variance
25

decomposition for the consumption terms of trade at local prices less the
variance decomposition for the consumption terms of trade at world prices,
gives:
0=M

’s from the vari-

ance decompositions of the two measures of the terms of trade. Since both
measures use the same weights, the shift in the allocation of variance across
goods boils down to a comparison of ’s across goods. Goods with ei;j >

i;j

will have their role in the variance decomposition elevated in the move to
local prices, while those with the opposite sign will be demoted in relative
importance.
The fact that relatively few goods account for the bulk of the variation
of the consumption terms of trade at world prices is also true for the consumption terms of trade at local prices. Table 4 reports the contribution
to variance of the 12 most important goods for both measures of the terms
of trade. The two lists have 11 common goods. Moving from world prices
to local prices causes the variance contribution of oil to fall by about 10%
from 0.61 to 0.51 while the contribution of medicine rises by 11%, from 0.13
to 0.24. This is consistent with LOP deviations tending to be larger for
medicine than oil.
The last part of the analysis revisits the question of the correlation between the production terms of trade and the consumption terms of trade, now
allowing for LOP deviations. Table 5 shows that the consumption terms of
26

trade is now consistently more variable than the production terms of trade
(8 of 13 countries). The two are less correlated than what was found using
world prices, possibly due to larger deviations from the LOP at the retail
stage than at the border.

Discussion

Our …ndings regarding the importance of oil are reminiscent of the analysis
of Backus and Crucini (2000), who documented the extraordinary extent to
which oil dominated the variation in the terms of trade of major industrialized countries from the 1970’s to the middle of the 1980’s. The thrust of
their analysis was to show how business cycle comovement evolved as the
importance of oil shocks relative to total factor productivity shocks changed
across historical periods and a¤ected importers di¤erently than exporters.
Figure 15 displays the quarterly data used in their paper along with the
relative price of oil in U.S. terms. By the latter, we mean the U.S. dollar
spot price of crude petroleum divided by the U.S. consumer price index. In
the …gure, the oil price is normalized so that it’s standard deviation matches
the standard deviation of the average of the terms of trade across all the
countries in the sample (the lower-right chart displays this average terms of
trade variable).
The standard deviation of the average terms of trade for the group is
about 5.5%, while the standard deviation of the relative price of oil is an
astounding 74%. Japan has the highest terms of trade variation at 21%,
27

while Switzerland’s is the most stable at 3.6%. Di¤erencing both the terms
of trade and the relative price of oil leave the basic implication unchanged,
oil plays a large role, mostly because it has enormous variation relative to
the terms of trade. The ratio of standard deviation of oil to that of the terms
of trade, in levels or growth rates, is about 10.
We view our preliminary …ndings as pointing to a broader role for a
small set of goods to dominate a nation’s terms of trade variation than was
previously thought. Uncovering this feature of the data would have been
daunting without the novel variance decomposition employed here. The fact
that oil dominates in a broad cross-section is consistent with prior work on oil
and the terms of trade. The notion that individual items other than oil may
dominate within the cross-section of countries is novel. Moreover, it also
suggests the value of organizing countries on the basis of their net export
shares and a larger set of commodities than focused upon here. In focusing
on the average country or group of countries, we have likely missed some
important micro-drivers of national terms of trade histories. It would also
be interesting to consider how the in‡uential set has evolved over time and
across countries, analogous to how oil’s role as been historically punctuated.
Unlike oil and other commodities where comparative advantage is largely
endowed, manufacturers and increasingly services play a large role in trade
and are likely to be more geographically footloose.
The empirical di¤erences between the consumption and production terms
of trade are compelling, though it is too early in the research program to say
28

how they relate to the broader literature on markups and distribution costs.
If the consumption terms of trade is fundamentally di¤erent than the production terms of trade, the trade balance adjustment process on the demand
and supply side needs to be elaborated. The common use of one elasticity
to relate prices to the trade balance condition is likely muddling consumption and production elasticities and two relative prices (the consumption and
production terms of trade) rather than one.
Our results are subject to a number of important caveats. First, the
Economist Intelligence Unit sample, while comprehensive, certainly does not
cover the universe of consumption items and misses intermediate goods that
are used by …rms and not used by consumers. This combined with the need
to reconcile …nal goods with trade shares, leads inevitably to some errors
and omissions in prices and trade weights. Second, the short sample also
prevents us from back-casting our analysis before 1990, when the EIU survey
was …rst developed. We hope to deal with some of these issues in future
work, such as using the Penn World Table data to push the sample back
in time. Finally, the comparisons with the o¢ cial, or production terms of
trade as we call it, is a crude starting point. We lack micro-prices at the
border to conduct an analogous variance decomposition of the o¢ cial terms
of trade into its microeconomic determinants. Such an exercise will likely
assign an important role for price variation of di¤erent brands in the terms
of trade. That is, the hedging argument implicit in our use of the net trade
share interacted with a single price (either the world price or the local price)
29

becomes an imperfect hedge in the realistic cases in which the U.S. dollar
in‡ation rates of say, imported Mercedes and exported In…nity sedans are
less than perfectly correlated. Much remains to be done.
