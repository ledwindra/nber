    "abstract": "\n\nIn this chapter, we discuss field experiments in surveys that are conducted with the purpose of learning about expectation formation and the link between expectations and behavior. We begin by reviewing the rationale for conducting experiments within surveys, rather than just relying on observational survey data. We then outline the most commonly used experimental paradigm, randomized information provision, along with some examples. Next, we outline a few methodological issues that are important to consider in the design of such experiments. We also provide a discussion of existing extensions of this paradigm, as well as of alternative approaches.\n\n",
