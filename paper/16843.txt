A Unified Model of Entrepreneurship Dynamics

JEL No. E2,G11,G31
ABSTRACT
We develop an incomplete-markets q-theoretic model to study entrepreneurship dynamics.
Precautionary motive, borrowing constraints, and capital illiquidity lead to underinvestment,
conservative debt use, under-consumption, and less risky portfolio allocation. The endogenous
liquid wealth-illiquid capital ratio w measures time-varying financial constraint. The option to
accumulate wealth before entry is critical for entrepreneurship. Flexible exit option is important
for risk management purposes. Investment increases and the private marginal value of liquidity
decreases as w decreases and exit becomes more likely, contrary to predictions of standard
financial constraint models. We show that the idiosyncratic risk premium is quantitatively
significant, especially for low w.

Introduction
Entrepreneurs face significant nondiversifiable business risks and liquidity constraints,

both of which we refer to as frictions.1 These frictions are important determinants for
the economics of entrepreneurship. They result in incomplete markets and cause business
decisions (e.g., capital accumulation and entry/exit) and household decisions (e.g., consumption/saving and asset allocation) to be highly linked, invalidating the standard completemarkets profit-maximizing analysis for entrepreneurial firms.
We develop an intertemporal model of entrepreneurship to study interdependent household and business decision making from the pre-entry stage to the post-exit stage. We model
entrepreneurship as a career choice followed by a capital accumulation/business growth problem in an incomplete-markets consumption/portfolio choice framework.
Becoming an entrepreneur often requires substantial start-up costs in terms of effort,
time, attention, commitment, and resources. Additionally, doing so often means giving up
the outside option of being a worker elsewhere and earning wages. Thus, becoming an
entrepreneur is effectively exercising a real option, which incurs both the business start-up
cost and the opportunity costs of giving up the alternative career/job. Unlike standard real
options, the entrepreneur’s option is non-tradable, illiquid, intertwined with other decisions,
and subject to important incomplete-markets frictions. Additionally, we show that the
flexibility of entry timing, (i.e., the “American” feature of the option) is critically important.
By backward induction, we first study the post-entry decision making. Then, using the
post-entry value function as the payoff of being an entrepreneur, we characterize the optimal
entry into entrepreneurship. After setting up the firm and optimally choosing the initial
size, the entrepreneur makes optimal firm investment as well as consumption-saving and
portfolio choice decisions. By making entrepreneurial business illiquid, capital adjustment
costs constrain the rate of investment and thus prevent the entrepreneur from targeting the
ideal level of capital stock. Therefore, liquid financial wealth becomes more valuable than
its pure face value because it mitigates the impact of frictions/financial constraints.
The modern q theory of investment studies optimal capital accumulation and the value
of capital with costly capital adjustments. However, much of the q theory was developed for

For example, see Evans and Jovanovic (1989), Gentry and Hubbard (2004), and Cagetti and De Nardi
(2006). In a recent survey of research on entrepreneurship in macroeconomics, Quadrini (2009) discusses
entrepreneurial career choice, entrepreneurial saving/investment, and economic development/growth.

firms owned by and run in the interest of well-diversified investors, where financial frictions
do not matter and the Modigliani-Miller (MM) theorem holds.2 However, around the world,
firms are often run by entrepreneurs, founders, families, and controlling shareholders, even in
publicly traded firms. La Porta, López-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (1999) document ownership
concentration by controlling shareholders for large publicly traded firms around the world.3
One important contribution of this paper is to develop the counterpart of the modern q
theory of investment for private firms run by nondiversified entrepreneurs/controlling shareholders. We do so by incorporating incomplete-markets frictions into a stochastic version of
Hayashi (1982), a classic investment model with adjustment costs. We show that the interaction between incomplete markets and capital adjustment costs makes liquidity a critical
determinant of corporate investment and liquidation policies.
A natural measure of liquidity is the ratio w between liquid financial wealth and illiquid
physical capital. Intuitively, a larger business requires more liquid wealth for the entrepreneur
to achieve the same level of financial strength, ceteris paribus. The higher the liquidity w,
the less constrained the entrepreneurial firm. Liquid wealth is thus more valuable than its
nominal/face value and the marginal value of liquid wealth is larger than unity.
We define enterprise value, average q, and marginal q for firms owned and run by nondiversified entrepreneurs. The entrepreneur’s certainty equivalent valuation of illiquid business
is the “private” enterprise value. Average q is the private enterprise value per unit of physical
capital. Marginal q measures the sensitivity (marginal changes) of private enterprise value
with respect to marginal changes in capital stock.
Without frictions, and with the additional assumption of convex and homogeneous capital adjustment costs as in Hayashi (1982), marginal q equals average q and investment is
determined by q. When productivity shocks are independently and identically distributed
(iid), the investment-capital ratio and Tobin’s q are constant at all times. Moreover, prof2

Brainard and Tobin (1968) and Tobin (1969) define the ratio between the firms market value to the
replacement cost of its capital stock, as q and propose to use this ratio to measure the firms incentive to
invest in capital. This ratio has become known as Tobin’s average q. Hayashi (1982) provides conditions
under which average q is equal to marginal q. Abel and Eberly (1994) develop a unified q theory of investment
in neoclassic settings. Lucas and Prescott (1971) and Abel (1983) are important early contributors.
3
See Burkart, Panunzi, and Shleifer (2003) for a model of a family firm. The law and finance/investor
protection literature documents compelling evidence on concentrated ownership around the world. Lan,
Wang, and Yang (2012) develop a dynamic model of investment and Tobin’s q for firms run by entrenched
nondiversified controlling shareholders under weak investor protection.

itability is uncorrelated with investment and the firm never gets liquidated regardless of the
size of realized losses. These predictions are obviously simplistic.4 However, we intentionally
choose this stylized frictionless benchmark in order to focus on the effects of idiosyncratic
risk and borrowing constraints on investment, average q, and marginal q.
With incomplete-markets frictions, investment, marginal q, and average q are all stochastic and vary with liquidity w. Investment depends on both marginal q and the marginal value
of liquid wealth. Moreover, the wedge between marginal q and average q is stochastic and
nonmonotonic. The option to liquidate the firm is critical for the entrepreneur to manage
business downside risk.5 The entrepreneur may prefer liquidation over continuation even before exhausting the debt capacity for risk management considerations. Liquidation becomes
increasingly attractive as the entrepreneur’s liquidity dries up. The optionality of liquidation
makes firm value convex in liquidity w and causes corporate investment to be nonmonotonic
in liquidity w, as the firm gets close to liquidation.
From the perspective of dynamic asset allocation, the entrepreneur not only chooses the
risk/return profile of the portfolio (the optimal mix between the risky market portfolio and
the risk-free asset), as in Merton (1971), but also determines the portfolio’s optimal liquidity
composition (the combination of liquid assets and the illiquid entrepreneurial business).
Incomplete-markets frictions make both systematic and idiosyncratic risks matter for asset
allocation.
Entrepreneurial finance, as an academic field, so far offers no apparent theoretical guidance on the cost of capital for entrepreneurial firms. We deliver an operational and analytically tractable framework to calculate the cost of capital for entrepreneurial firms. Idiosyncratic business risks as well as systematic ones have important effects on firm investment,
financing, and the private equity premium. Our model provides a guideline for empirical
research on private equity premium. There is much debate on the size of the idiosyncratic
4
The Arrow-Debreu theorem holds under complete markets. Thus, consumption smoothing (utility maximization) is independent of total wealth maximization. The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) holds for
the firm. Our q theory of investment under complete markets extends Hayashi (1982) to account for the
(systematic) risk premium.
5
For simplicity, we focus on the liquidation option as the exit option for downside risk protection. Without
changing the analysis in any fundamental way, we can extend our model to allow the entrepreneur to have
an exit option when doing well. For example, selling to diversified investors or via an initial public offering
(IPO) are two ways for the entrepreneur to exit when doing well. See Pástor, Taylor, and Veronesi (2009)
and Chen, Miao, and Wang (2010) for models with IPO as an exit option in good times.

risk premium. For example, Moskowitz and Vissing-Jørgensen (2002) find a low value, while
Mueller (2011) finds the opposite.
We also show that the option value of waiting to become an entrepreneur (entry timing)
is valuable. Before becoming an entrepreneur, the key state variable is the liquid financial
wealth. We solve for the optimal cutoff level for liquid wealth and initial project size for
the to-be entrepreneur. Intuitively, this cutoff wealth level depends on the outside option,
fixed start-up cost, risk aversion, and other important preference and technology parameters.
The initial project size trades off liquidity needs and business profitability. Cross-sectional
heterogeneity among entrepreneurs along preferences, business ideas/production technology,
and outside options gives rise to different entrepreneurial entry, consumption-saving, portfolio
choice, capital accumulation, and business exit decisions.
While almost all existing work on the dynamics of entrepreneurship uses numerical programming, our model is analytically tractable. We provide an operational and quantitative
framework to value these illiquid non-tradable options, which interact with other important
decisions such as consumption-saving, firm investment, and portfolio allocation.
Quantitatively, we show that there are significant welfare costs for the entrepreneur to
bear nondiversifiable idiosyncratic risk. For an expected-utility entrepreneur who has no
liquid wealth and whose coefficient of relative risk aversion is two, as in our baseline calculation, the certainty equivalent valuation of the entrepreneurial business is about 11% lower
than the complete-markets benchmark.
Some predictions of our model have been empirically confirmed. For example, our model
predicts that the entrepreneur significantly underinvests in business, consumes less, and
invests less in the market portfolio than a similarly wealthy household. Indeed, Heaton and
Lucas (2000) find that entrepreneurs with variable business income hold less wealth in stocks
than other similarly wealthy households.

Heaton and Lucas (2004) show that risky non-recourse debt helps the entrepreneur diversify
business risk in a static framework with capital budgeting, capital structure, and portfolio
choice decisions. Chen, Miao, and Wang (2010) study the effects of nondiversifiable risk
on entrepreneurial finance by building on Leland (1994).6 They show that more risk-averse
entrepreneurs borrow more in order to lower their business risk exposure.7 Herranz, Krasa,
and Villamil (2009) assess the impact of legal institutions on entrepreneurial firm dynamics.
Evans and Jovanovic (1989) show the importance of wealth and liquidity constraints for
entrepreneurship.8 Cagetti and De Nardi (2006) quantify the importance of liquidity constraints on aggregate capital accumulation and wealth distribution by constructing a model
with entry, exit, and investment decisions. Hurst and Lusardi (2004) challenge the importance of liquidity constraints and provide evidence that the start-up sizes of entrepreneurial
firms tend to be small. We develop a unified model of entrepreneurship and show the
importance of wealth effects by incorporating endogenous entry/exit in a model with nondiversifiable risk and liquidity constraints.
Most models on portfolio choice with non-tradable income assume exogenous income.9
Our model endogenizes the non-marketable income from business via optimal entrepreneurial
decisions. The endogenous business entry/exit and consumption/portfolio decisions are important margins for the entrepreneur to manage risk. The entry/exit options significantly
alter the entrepreneur’s decision making. Some of our results are also related to the real
options analysis under incomplete markets. Miao and Wang (2007) and Hugonnier and
Morellec (2007) study the impact of nondiversifiable risk on real options exercising. These
papers show that the nondiversifiable risk significantly alters option exercising strategies.
Our model also relates to recent work on dynamic corporate finance.10 Rampini and

enforcements are limited. Lorenzoni and Walentin (2007) study the relation between investment and Tobin’s q in a limited-enforcement framework which generates an endogenous
borrowing constraint. These papers assume risk-neutral entrepreneurs so as to focus on
contractual (limited enforcements) frictions, and thus do not study the effect of the entrepreneur’s precautionary demand on corporate investment.
Bolton, Chen, and Wang (2011), henceforth BCW, analyze optimal investment, financing, and risk management decisions and valuation for a financially constrained risk-neutral
firm. BCW focus on various transaction costs that a firm incurs when raising external funds.
DeMarzo, Fishman, He, and Wang (2010), henceforth DFHW, integrate the risk-neutral dynamic agency framework of DeMarzo and Fishman (2007b) and DeMarzo and Sannikov
(2006) with the neoclassic q theory of investment. DFHW derive an optimal dynamic contract and provide financial implementation.11
Unlike BCW and DFHW, our paper studies entrepreneurial finance. The empirical predictions of our model also fundamentally differ from theirs. For example, our model predicts
that the liquidation option makes the entrepreneurial firm value convex in liquidity near the
liquidation boundary, while the liquidation options in both BCW and DFHW often make
firm value concave in liquidity. We separate risk aversion from the elasticity of intertemporal
substitution (EIS) by using non-expected recursive utility (Epstein and Zin, 1989). Also, we
quantify the entrepreneurial firm’s idiosyncratic private equity risk premium. Neither BCW
nor DFHW address these issues given their risk-neutrality assumptions. The entrepreneur’s
risk management considerations fundamentally change the economics of business investment
and entry/exit decisions. While all three papers use the seminal model of Hayashi (1982)
as the MM benchmark, most importantly, the financing frictions and thus the economic
issues/mechanisms in these papers are fundamentally distinct.

The model
We first introduce the agent’s preferences and then set up the optimization problem.

Preferences. The agent has a preference featuring both constant relative risk aversion and
constant EIS (Epstein and Zin, 1989; Weil, 1990). We use the continuous-time formulation

a recursive preference defined as follows

where f (C, J) is known as the normalized aggregator for consumption C and the agent’s utility J. Duffie and Epstein (1992) show that f (C, J) for Epstein-Zin non-expected homothetic

χ=

The parameter ψ > 0 measures the EIS, and the parameter γ > 0 is the coefficient of relative
risk aversion. The parameter ζ > 0 is the agent’s subjective discount rate.
The widely used time-additive separable constant-relative-risk-averse (CRRA) utility is a
special case of the Duffie-Epstein-Zin-Weil recursive utility specification where the coefficient
of relative risk aversion is equal to the inverse of the EIS ψ, i.e., γ = ψ −1 implying χ = 1.12
In general, with γ 6= 1/ψ, we can separately study the effects of risk aversion and the EIS.
Career choice and initial firm size. The agent is endowed with an entrepreneurial idea and
initial wealth W0 . The entrepreneurial idea is defined by a productive capital accumulation/production function to be introduced soon. To implement the entrepreneurial idea, the
agent chooses a start-up time T 0 , pays a one-time fixed start-up cost Φ, and also chooses
the initial capital stock KT 0 . One example is becoming a taxi/limo driver. The agent can
first start with a used car. After building up savings, the agent tolerates risk better and
potentially upgrades the vehicle. With even more savings, the agent may further increase
firm size by hiring drivers and running a limo service.
Before becoming an entrepreneur, the agent can take an alternative job (e.g., to be a
worker) to build up financial wealth. Being an entrepreneur is a discrete career decision.13
12

For this special case, we have f (C, J) = U (C) − ζJ, where U (C) is the expected CRRA utility with
−1
γ = ψ −1 and hence, U (C) = ζC 1−ψ /(1−ψ −1 ). Note that for CRRA utility, f (C, J)
additively separable.

By integrating Eq. (1) forward for this CRRA special case, we obtain Jt = maxC Et t e−ζ(s−t) U (C(s))ds .
13
We do not allow the agent to be a part-time entrepreneur and a part-time worker at the same time.
This is a standard and reasonable assumption. For example, see Vereshchagina and Hopenhayn (2009) for a
dynamic career choice model featuring the same assumption.

7

We naturally assume that being an entrepreneur offers potentially a higher reward at a
greater risk than being a worker. Hamilton (2000) finds that earnings of the self-employed
are smaller, on average, and have higher variance than earnings of workers using data from the
US Census Bureau Survey of Income and Program Participation. To contrast the earnings
profile differences between an entrepreneur and a worker, we assume that the outside option
(by being a worker) gives the agent a constant flow of income at the rate of rΠ.
At the optimally chosen (stochastic) entry time T 0 , the agent uses a combination of
personal savings and collateralized borrowing to finance (KT 0 + Φ). Lenders make zero profit
in competitive capital markets. If the entrepreneur reneges on debt, creditors can always
liquidate the firm’s capital and recover fraction l > 0 per unit of capital. The borrower thus
has no incentive to default on debt and can borrow up to lK at the risk-free rate by using
capital as the collateral.
We will show that initial wealth W0 plays a role in how long it takes the agent to
become an entrepreneur and the choice of the firm’s initial size. Borrowing constraints and
nondiversifiable risk are conceptually and quantitatively important. Moreover, these two
frictions interact and generate economically significant feedback effects on entrepreneurship.
Entrepreneurial idea: capital investment and production technology. The entrepreneurial
idea is defined by a capital accumulation/production function.
Let I denote the gross investment. As is standard in capital accumulation models, the
change of capital stock K is given by the difference between gross investment and depreciation, in that
dKt = (It − δKt ) dt,

t ≥ 0,

(4)

where δ ≥ 0 is the rate of depreciation. The firm’s productivity shock dAt over the period
(t, t + dt) is independently and identically distributed (iid), and is given by
dAt = µA dt + σA dZt ,

(5)

where Z is a standard Brownian motion, µA > 0 is the mean of the productivity shock, and
σA > 0 is the volatility of the productivity shock. The firm’s operating revenue over time
period (t, t + dt) is proportional to its time-t capital stock Kt , and is given by Kt dAt . The
firm’s operating profit dYt over the same period is given by
dYt = Kt dAt − It dt − G(It , Kt )dt,
8

(6)

where the price of the investment good is set to unity and G(I, K) is the adjustment cost.
The cumulative productivity shock A follows an arithmetic Brownian motion process,
which implies that the productivity shock for the period (t, t + dt), dAt , is iid. We thus save
a state variable in the optimization problem and focus on the effects of incomplete-markets
frictions on investment and the value of capital. Our specification of the productivity process
differs from the conventional practice, which directly postulates a stochastic process for
productivity and, thus, productivity naturally appears as a state variable in conventional
q-theory models.14
Following Hayashi (1982), we assume that the firm’s adjustment cost G(I, K) is homogeneous of degree one in I and K, and write G(I, K) in the following homogeneous form
G (I, K) = g(i)K,

(7)

where i = I/K is the firm’s investment-capital ratio and g(i) is an increasing and convex
function. With homogeneity, Tobin’s average q is equal to marginal q under perfect capital
markets. However, as we will show, the nondiversifiable risk drives a wedge between Tobin’s
average q and marginal q for the entrepreneur. For simplicity, we assume that
g (i) =

θi2
,
2

(8)

where the parameter θ measures the degree of the adjustment cost. A higher value θ implies
a more costly adjustment process.
The liquidation/exit option. The entrepreneur has an option to liquidate capital at any
moment. Liquidation is irreversible and gives a terminal value lK, where l > 0 is a constant.
Let T l denote the entrepreneur’s optimally chosen stochastic liquidation time. To focus on
the interesting case, we assume capital is sufficiently productive. Thus, liquidating capital
when capital markets are perfect is not optimal because doing so destroys going-concern
value. However, when the entrepreneur is not well-diversified, liquidation provides an important channel for the entrepreneur to manage the downside business risk exposure. As we
show later, this liquidation option is critical for the entrepreneur’s optimization problem to
be well-defined.15
14

Specifically, a common specification of the operating profit is Yt = πt Kt − It − G(It , Kt ) − OCt , where
OC refers to operating costs including wages, and the productivity π follows a stochastic process.
15
Incomplete-markets frictions and the convex adjustment costs limit the rate at which the entrepreneur
can adjust the firm investment in response to productivity shock. Therefore, without the liquidation/exit

9

Our production specification features the widely used “AK” technology augmented with
capital adjustment costs. Our specification is a reasonable starting point and is also analytically tractable. Next, we turn to the agent’s financial investment opportunities.
Financial investment opportunities. The agent can invest in a risk-free asset which pays a
constant rate of interest r and the risky market portfolio (Merton, 1971). Assume that the
incremental return dRt of the market portfolio over time period dt is iid,
dRt = µR dt + σR dBt ,

(9)

where µR and σR are constant mean and volatility parameters of the market portfolio return
process, and B is a standard Brownian motion. Let
η=

µR − r
σR

(10)

denote the Sharpe ratio of the market portfolio. Let ρ denote the correlation coefficient
between the shock to the entrepreneur’s business and the shock to the market portfolio.
With incomplete markets (|ρ| < 1), the entrepreneur cannot completely hedge business risk.
Nondiversifiable risk will thus play a role in decision making and private valuation.
Let W and X denote the agent’s financial wealth and the amount invested in the risky
asset, respectively. Then, (W − X) is the remaining amount invested in the risk-free asset.
Before becoming an entrepreneur (t ≤ T 0 ), the wealth accumulation is given by
dWt = r (Wt − Xt ) dt + µR Xt dt + σR Xt dBt − Ct dt + rΠdt ,

t < T0 .

(11)

While being an entrepreneur, the liquid financial wealth W evolves as follows:
dWt = r (Wt − Xt ) dt + µR Xt dt + σR Xt dBt − Ct dt + dYt ,

T 0 < t < T l.

(12)

Finally, after exiting from the business, the retired entrepreneur’s wealth evolves as follows:
dWt = r (Wt − Xt ) dt + µR Xt dt + σR Xt dBt − Ct dt ,

t > Tl .

(13)

The entrepreneur can borrow against capital K at all times, and hence, wealth W can
be negative. To ensure that entrepreneurial borrowing is risk-free, we require that the
option, sufficiently large negative productivity shocks may cause the entrepreneur’s total net worth to be
negative and make the problem undefined for certain preferences.

10

liquidation value of capital lK is greater than outstanding liability, in that
T 0 ≤ t ≤ T l.

Wt ≥ −lKt ,

(14)

Despite being able to borrow up to lKt at the risk-free rate r, the entrepreneur may rationally
choose not to exhaust the debt capacity for precautionary reasons.16 Without capital as
collateral, the agent cannot borrow: Wt ≥ 0 for t ≤ T 0 and t ≥ T l .
The optimization problem. The agent maximizes the utility defined in Eqs. (1)–(2). The
timeline can be described in five steps. First, before becoming an entrepreneur (t ≤ T 0 ),
the agent collects income as a worker and chooses consumption and portfolio allocations.
Second, the agent chooses the optimal entry time T 0 to start up the firm and the initial
firm size KT 0 by incurring the fixed start-up cost Φ, and financing the total costs (KT 0 + Φ)
with savings and potentially some collateralized borrowing. Third, the agent chooses consumption and portfolio choice while running the firm subject to the collateralized borrowing
limit (14). Fourth, the agent optimally chooses the stochastic liquidation time T l . Finally,
after liquidating capital, the agent collects the liquidation proceeds, retires, allocates wealth
between the risk-free and the risky market portfolio, and consumes.

Benchmark: Complete markets
With complete markets, the entrepreneur’s optimization problem can be decomposed

into two separate ones: total wealth maximization and utility maximization. We will show
that our model has the homogeneity property. The lower case denotes the corresponding
variable in the upper case scaled by K. For example, w denotes the liquid wealth-illiquid
capital ratio, w = W/K. The following proposition summarizes main results under complete
markets.

The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) holds for the firm with its expected return given by

Eqs. (18) and (19) give Tobin’s q and the investment-capital ratio, respectively. The
adjustment cost makes installed capital earn rents and, hence, Tobin’s q differs from unity.
Note that the average q is equal to the marginal q as in Hayashi (1982). The entrepreneur’s
total wealth is given by pF B (w) = w + q F B , the sum of q F B and liquidity measure w.

Eq. (20) gives consumption, effectively the permanent-income rule under complete markets.
The entrepreneur’s MPC out of wealth mF B generally depends on the risk-free rate r, the
EIS ψ, the coefficient of risk aversion γ, and the Sharpe ratio η = (µR − r)/σR . Eq. (22)
gives x(w), the portfolio allocation to the market portfolio. The first term in Eq. (22) is
the well-known mean-variance allocation, and the second term is the intertemporal hedging
demand.
We explicitly account for the effects of risk on investment and Tobin’s q. We decompose
the total volatility of the productivity shock into systematic and idiosyncratic components.
The systematic volatility is equal to ρσA and the idiosyncratic component is given by
 = σA

(25)

The standard CAPM holds in our benchmark. The expected return is given in Eq. (23) and
β is given by Eq. (24). As in standard asset pricing theory, the idiosyncratic volatility 
carries no risk premium and plays no role under complete markets. However, importantly,
the idiosyncratic volatility  will play a significant role in our incomplete-markets setting.

Incomplete-markets model solution: Post-entry
Having characterized the complete-markets solution, we now turn to the incomplete-

markets setting. We first consider the agent’s decision problem after liquidation, and then
derive the entrepreneur’s interdependent decision making before exit.
The agent’s decision problem after exiting entrepreneurship. After exiting from entrepreneurship, the entrepreneur is no longer exposed to the business risk and faces a classic Merton
consumption/portfolio allocation problem with non-expected recursive utility. The solution
is effectively the same as the complete-markets results in Proposition 1 (without physical
capital). We summarize the results as a corollary to Proposition 1.
Corollary 1. The entrepreneur’s value function takes the following homothetic form,

The entrepreneur’s first-order condition (FOC) for consumption C is given by
fC (C, J) = JW (K, W ) .

(30)

The above condition states that the marginal utility of consumption fC is equal to the
marginal utility of wealth JW . The FOC with respect to investment I gives
(1 + GI (I, K)) JW (K, W ) = JK (K, W ) .

(31)

To increase capital stock by one unit, the entrepreneur needs to forgo (1 + GI (I, K)) units
of wealth. Therefore, the entrepreneur’s marginal cost of investing is given by the product
of (1 + GI (I, K)) and the marginal utility of wealth JW . The marginal benefit of adding a
unit of capital is JK . At optimality, the entrepreneur equates the two sides of Eq. (31).

where b is given in Eq. (17). Comparing Eq. (33) with the value function without the

equivalent (CE) wealth, the minimal amount of wealth for which the agent is willing to
permanently give up the business and liquid wealth W . Let W denote the entrepreneur’s
endogenous liquidation boundary and w = W /K. The following theorem summarizes the
entrepreneur’s decision making and scaled CE wealth p(w) = P (K, W )/K.

where the drift µw (w) gives the expected change of w and is given by
µw (w) = (r + δ − i(w))w + (µR − r)x(w) + µA − i(w) − g(i(w)) − c(w) .

(43)

However, if Eqs. (37)–(38) do not admit an interior solution satisfying w > −l, the
optimal liquidation boundary is then given by the maximal borrowing capacity, w = −l.
We note that the scenario where the constraint binds can only occur when the coefficient of
relative risk aversion γ < 1.17
To highlight the critical role played by the adjustment costs, we first analyze the case
with no adjustment costs, which serves as a natural comparison benchmark.
A special case: Incomplete markets with no adjustment costs. We show that incomplete
markets alone have no effects on portfolio allocation. With liquid physical capital (no adjustment costs), the entrepreneur optimally allocates a constant fraction of wealth invested
in the firm: the fraction K/(K + W ) is constant and is given by
K
K +W

=

µA − ρησA − (r + δ)
.
γ(1 − ρ2 )σA2

(44)

Intuitively, the firm needs to be sufficiently productive to ensure that the entrepreneur takes
a long position in the firm. Specifically, we need the risk-adjusted productivity, µA − ρησA ,
to be larger than the user cost of capital, r + δ, in that
µA − ρησA > r + δ .

(45)

The entrepreneur has a time-invariant portfolio allocation rule Eq. (46) as in Merton (1971)
with no adjustment costs under incomplete markets. By dynamically adjusting the size of
capital stock (either upward or downward frictionlessly), markets are effectively complete for
the entrepreneur. The optimal liquidity ratio w is constant and is given by
w =

γ(1 − ρ2 )σA2
− 1.
µA − ρησA − (r + δ)

(46)

Both marginal q and average q equal unity. Since liquidation recovers l < 1 per unit of capital,
the entrepreneur never liquidates capital without adjustment costs even under incomplete
markets.18
17

When γ ≥ 1 and without the exit option, the entrepreneur’s utility approaches minus infinity at w =
−l with positive probability. Therefore, when γ ≥ 1, the exit option is necessary for the entrepreneur’s
optimization problem to be well-defined. The entrepreneur rationally stays away from the constraint, w > −l.
18
We are grateful to the referee for suggesting that we explicitly analyze this special case and correctly
conjecturing the intuitive solution. Details are available upon request.

In our model, the adjustment cost makes it difficult for the entrepreneur to hold an
optimal portfolio mix of the market portfolio, the risk-free asset, and a position in the entrepreneurial firm. Using this special no-adjustment-cost case, we show that the incompletemarkets friction alone does not distort the entrepreneur’s optimal portfolio allocation. It
is the interactive effect between the adjustment cost and incomplete markets that generate
novel dynamic properties of investment, consumption, portfolio allocation, and business exit.

Results: Post-entry

Parameter choices. When applicable, all parameter values are annualized. The risk-free
interest rate is r = 4.6% and the aggregate equity risk premium is (µR − r) = 6%. The
annual volatility of the market portfolio return is σR = 20% implying the Sharpe ratio for
the aggregate stock market η = (µR − r)/σR = 30%. The subjective discount rate is set to
equal to the risk-free rate, ζ = r = 4.6%.
On the real investment side, our model is a version of the q theory of investment (Hayashi,
1982). Using the sample of large firms in Compustat from 1981 to 2003, Eberly, Rebelo, and
Vincent (2009) provide empirical evidence in support of Hayashi (1982). Using their work
as a guideline, we set the expected productivity µA = 20% and the volatility of productivity
shocks σA = 10%. Fitting the complete-markets q F B and iF B to the sample averages, we
obtain the adjustment cost parameter θ = 2 and the rate of depreciation for capital stock
δ = 12.5%.19 We choose the liquidation parameter l = 0.9 (Hennessy and Whited, 2007).
We set the correlation between the market portfolio return and the business risk ρ = 0,
which implies that the idiosyncratic volatility of the productivity shock  = σA = 10%. We
consider two widely used values for the coefficient of relative risk aversion, γ = 2 and γ = 4.
We set the EIS to be ψ = 0.5, so that the first case corresponds to the expected utility with
γ = 1/ψ = 2, and the second case maps to a non-expected utility with γ = 4 > 1/ψ = 2.
Table 1 summarizes the notations and if applicable, value choices for various parameters.
19

The averages are 1.3 for Tobin’s q and 0.15 for the investment-capital ratio, respectively, for the sample
used by Eberly, Rebelo, and Vincent (2009). The imputed θ = 2 is in the range of estimates used in the
literature. See Whited (1992), Hall (2004), Riddick and Whited (2009), and Eberly, Rebelo, and Vincent
(2009).

5.1.

The entrepreneur’s welfare

The entrepreneur’s welfare is measured by the value function given in Eq. (33), which is
homogeneous of degree (1 − γ) in the certainty equivalent wealth P (K, W ).
Private enterprise value and average q. In corporate finance, enterprise value is defined as
firm value excluding liquid assets (e.g., cash and other short-term marketable securities).
Similarly, we may define private enterprise value Q(K, W ) for an entrepreneurial firm as
follows,
Q(K, W ) = P (K, W ) − W.

(47)

Private average q is given by the ratio between private enterprise value Q(K, W ) and capital
q(w) =

Q(K, W )
= p(w) − w .
K

(48)

Importantly, private average q defined in Eq. (48) reflects the impact of nondiversifiable risk
on the subjective valuation of capital. In the limit as w → ∞, q(w) approaches q F B .
Insert Fig. 1 here.
For Figs. 1–4, we graph for two levels of risk aversion, γ = 2, 4. Panels A and B of
Fig. 1 plot p(w) and q(w), respectively. Note that p(w) and q(w) = p(w) − w convey the
same information. Graphically, it is easier to read Panel B for q(w) than Panel A for p(w),
thus, we discuss q(w). The less risk-averse the entrepreneur, the higher private average
q(w). Intuitively, q(w) increases with w. As w → ∞, the entrepreneur effectively attaches
no premium for the nondiversifiable risk and thus, limw→∞ q(w) → q F B = 1.31. However,
quantitatively, the convergence requires a high value of w. At w = 3, q(3) = 1.23 for γ = 2,
and q(3) = 1.21 for γ = 4, both of which are significantly lower than q F B = 1.31.
Importantly, q(w) is not globally concave. Risk aversion does not imply that q(w) is
concave, even though the risk-averse entrepreneur’s value function J(K, W ) is concave in
W . Panel B of Fig. 1 shows that q(w) is concave in w for w ≥ w
e where w
e is the inflection
point at which q 00 (w)
e = p00 (w)
e = 0. The inflection point is w
e = −0.658 for γ = 2, and
w
e = −0.495 for γ = 4. For an entrepreneur with sufficient financial slack (w ≥ w),
e q(w)
is concave in w. For an entrepreneur with low financial slack (w ≤ w),
e q(w) is convex in
w. The exit option allows the entrepreneur to eliminate the nondiversifiable business risk
exposure and thus causes q(w) to be convex in w for sufficiently low w.
18

The marginal value of wealth PW (K, W ). For public firms, the marginal impact of cash on
firm value is referred to as the marginal value of cash (Bolton, Chen, and Wang, 2011). For
entrepreneurial firms, PW (K, W ) measures the entrepreneur’s marginal (certainty equivalent)
value of liquid wealth, which is the natural counterpart to the marginal value of cash for
public firms.
Panel C of Fig. 1 plots PW (K, W ) = p0 (w). With complete markets, PW (K, W ) = 1.
With incomplete markets, PW (K, W ) ≥ 1 because wealth has the additional benefit of
mitigating financial constraints due to nondiversifiable risk on investment and consumption.
Note that p0 (w) = 1 at the liquidation boundary w, because the agent is no longer exposed
to nondiversifiable risk after exiting entrepreneurship. Then, p0 (w) increases with w up to
the endogenous inflection point w
e (at which p00 (w)
e = 0), decreases with w for w ≥ w,
e and
finally approaches unity as w → ∞ and reaches the complete-markets solution.
Loose arguments may have led us to conclude that less constrained entrepreneurs (i.e.,
higher w) value their wealth less and PW (K, W ) decreases with wealth (p00 (w) < 0). This is
incorrect because of the liquidation option, as we see in Panel C.
Marginal value of capital PK (K, W ), also referred to as (private) marginal q. For public
firms owned by diversified investors, the marginal change of firm value with respect to an
increase in capital is known as marginal q. For a firm owned and managed by a nondiversified
entrepreneur, we naturally refer to the marginal increase of P (K, W ) with respect to an
increase of capital, PK (K, W ), as the private (subjective) marginal q. Using the homogeneity
property, we may write the private marginal q as follows,
PK (K, W ) = p(w) − wp0 (w) .

(49)

Panel D of Fig. 1 plots the private marginal q, PK (K, W ). Note that the private marginal
q is not monotonic in w. One seemingly natural but loose intuition is that the (private)
marginal q increases with w. Presumably, less financially constrained entrepreneurs face
lower costs of investment and hence have higher marginal q. However, this intuition in
general does not hold. Using the formula (49) for private marginal q, we obtain
dPK (K, W )
= −wp00 (w) .
dw

19

(50)

Therefore, the sign of dPK (K, W )/dw depends on both the sign of w and the concavity of
p(w). When w > 0 and p(w) is concave, PK (K, W ) increases with w. When the entrepreneur
is in debt (w < 0) and additionally p(w) is convex, PK (K, W ) also increases with w. In the
intermediate region of w, P (K, W ) may decrease with w (e. g., when w < 0 and p00 (w) < 0).
Additionally, marginal q may exceed the first-best q F B in the debt region, w < 0.
Marginal q versus average q. Under complete markets, marginal q equals average q as in
Hayashi (1982). Given iid shocks, q is constant. However, with nondiversifiable risk, marginal
q differs from average q. The wedge between marginal q and average q is given by
PK (K, W ) − q(w) = −w (p0 (w) − 1) .

(51)

The sign of this wedge is given by the sign of w (note p0 (w) ≥ 1). If w > 0, increasing K
makes the entrepreneur more constrained by mechanically lowering w = W/K, and thus gives
rise to a negative wedge PK (K, W ) − q(w). Generally, increasing K makes the entrepreneur
richer. However, for an entrepreneur in debt (W < 0), increasing K moves w from the
left towards the origin, which relaxes financial constraints and thus implies a positive wedge
PK (K, W ) − q(w). Therefore, the wedge between the qs is nonmonotonic in w.

5.2.

Optimal investment and exercising of the liquidation option

The FOC (31) for investment may be simplified as follows,
1 + θi(w) =

PK (K, W )
.
PW (K, W )

(52)

The left side is the marginal cost of investing. The right side is the ratio between the marginal
q, PK (K, W ), and the marginal value of cash p0 (w). The entrepreneur equates the two sides
of Eq. (52) by optimally choosing investment. Investment thus depends on not only the
marginal q but also the marginal value of cash.20 Both the private marginal q and PW are
endogenously determined. Moreover, they are highly correlated.
20

Bolton, Chen, and Wang (2011) derive a similar FOC for investment in a dynamic corporate finance
framework when cash/credit is the marginal source of financing for a (risk-neutral) financially constrained
firm. In an optimal dynamic contracting framework, DeMarzo, Fishman, He, and Wang (2010) also derive a
similar investment FOC under endogenous financial constraints. However, the economic settings, economic
interpretations and financial frictions are different across these papers. In Bolton, Chen, and Wang (2011),
the friction is costly external financing. In DeMarzo, Fishman, He, and Wang (2010), the friction is dynamic
managerial agency (e.g. hidden cash flow diversion or effort choices). In our paper, it is the nondiversifiable
(i.e. non-spanned) idiosyncratic business risk and liquidity constraints under incomplete markets.

20

We point out that marginal q plays a different role in our model as compared to the
existing work on the q theory of investment. In standard q models with convex adjustment
costs, the firm optimally equates the marginal cost of investing with the marginal q, and
the latter encapsulates time-variation in the firm’s investment opportunities. Unlike these
q models, it is the incomplete-markets friction-induced demand for liquidity that drives
changes in marginal q in our model. Importantly, the incomplete-markets friction alone
(without adjustment costs) does not generate any interesting dynamics for investment and
marginal q as we show at the end of Section 4. In our model, the liquidity ratio w determines
the marginal value of liquid wealth PW , the marginal q, and hence firm investment via
the FOC (52). Our work thus complements the existing work in the q-theory literature by
focusing on the incomplete-markets frictions on dynamics of marginal q and investment.
Insert Fig. 2 here.
Fig. 2 plots i(w) and i0 (w), the sensitivity of i(w) with respect to w. Nondiversifiable
business risk induces underinvestment, i(w) < iF B = 0.156. The underinvestment result
(relative to the first-best MM benchmark) is common in incomplete-markets models.
However, investment-capital ratio is not monotonic in w, which implies that investment
may decrease with wealth! This seemingly counterintuitive result directly follows from the
convexity of p(w) in w. We may characterize i0 (w) as follows,
i0 (w) = −

p(w)p00 (w)
.
θ(p0 (w))2

(53)

Using the above result, we see that whenever p(w) is concave, investment increases with
wealth. However, whenever p(w) is convex, investment decreases with w. Put differently,
underinvestment is less of a concern when the entrepreneur is closer to liquidating the business because liquidation also has the benefit of leading the entrepreneur to exit incomplete
markets. The entrepreneur has weaker incentives to cut investment if the distance to exiting
incomplete markets is shorter. This explains why investment may decrease in w when the
exit option is sufficiently close to being in the money (i.e., when w is sufficiently low).
Now we turn to the entrepreneur’s liquidation decision. Costly liquidation of capital
provides a downside risk protection for the entrepreneur. Quantitatively, this exit option
is quite valuable for low w. The exit option generates convexity near the endogenous left
21

boundary w. Recall that debt is fully collateralized and is risk-free. Thus, liquidation only
provides an exit option which becomes in the money for the entrepreneur bearing significant
nondiversifiable risks (i.e., being sufficiently low in w). In Zame (1993), Heaton and Lucas
(2004), and Chen, Miao, and Wang (2010), the benefits of debt rely on the riskiness of
debt, which creates state-contingent insurance. A liquidation option in our model provides
downside protection, as a default option in risky debt models does.
Diversification is more valuable for more risk-averse entrepreneurs, therefore, a more riskaverse entrepreneur liquidates capital earlier in order to avoid idiosyncratic risk exposure and
achieve full diversification. The optimal liquidation boundaries are w = −0.8 for γ = 2 and
w = −0.65 for γ = 4, respectively. Note that the borrowing constraint does not bind even for
a less risk-averse entrepreneur (e.g., γ = 2). The entrepreneur rationally liquidates capital
before exhausting the debt capacity w ≥ −l = −0.9 to ensure that wealth does not fall too
low. While borrowing more to invest is desirable in terms of generating positive value for
(diversified) investors, doing so may be too risky for nondiversified entrepreneurs. Moreover,
anticipating that the liquidation option will soon be exercised, the entrepreneur has less
incentive to distort investment when w is close to the liquidation boundary. This option
anticipation effect explains the nonmonotonicity result for i(w) in w. Next, we turn to the
entrepreneur’s portfolio choice decisions.

5.3.

Optimal portfolio allocation and consumption

The entrepreneur’s market portfolio allocation x(w) has both a hedging demand term
given by −ρσA /σR and a mean-variance demand term given by ησR−1 p(w)/h(w). The hedging
term −ρσA /σR is constant because of time-invariant real and financial investment opportunities (Merton, 1971). We thus focus on the more interesting mean-variance demand term.
Unlike the standard portfolio allocation, the entrepreneur incorporates the impact of
nondiversifiable risk by (1) replacing w + q F B with p(w) in calculating “total” wealth and
(2) adjusting risk aversion from γ to the effective risk aversion h(w) given in Eq. (35).
Insert Fig. 3 here.
Panel A of Fig. 3 plots h(w) for γ = 2, 4. For the first-best (complete-markets) case,
effective risk aversion h(w) equals γ. In the region where w ≥ −0.584 for γ = 2 and
22

w ≥ −0.437 for γ = 4, h(w) decreases with w as self insurance becomes more effective. In
the limit as w → ∞, h(w) → γ. Importantly, in the region where w ≤ −0.584 for γ = 2
and w ≤ −0.437 for γ = 4, h(w) decreases as w decreases towards the exit option. Near
the optimal liquidation boundary w, the effective risk aversion h(w) is lower than γ, which
follows from h(w) = γ − (w + l)p00 (w) < γ. Intuitively, when the liquidation option is in the
money, the entrepreneur behaves in a less risk-averse manner than under complete markets
because of the positive effect of volatility on the option value. Panel A also shows that h(w)
peaks at interior values of w and is nonmonotonic in w.
Panel B of Fig. 3 plots the demand for the market portfolio x(w). The first-best optimal
portfolio allocation xF B (w) is linearly increasing in w. With incomplete markets, portfolio
allocation becomes more conservative, x(w) < xF B (w). This prediction is consistent with
empirical findings. For example, Heaton and Lucas (2000) find that entrepreneurs with
high and variable business income hold less wealth in stocks than other similarly wealthy
households. The intuition is as follows. Incomplete-markets frictions lower the certainty
equivalent wealth p(w) and also make the marginal value of wealth p0 (w) > 1, both of
which lead to lower portfolio allocation. Additionally, portfolio allocation x(w) becomes
more aggressive as the exit option becomes deeper in the money, i.e. as w approaches the
liquidation boundary w. For example, x(w) is decreasing in w when w ≤ −0.684 for γ = 2
and when w ≤ −0.509 for γ = 4.
Insert Fig. 4 here.
Consumption is also lower than the complete-markets benchmark, c(w) < cF B (w) because
frictions imply p(w) < pF B (w) and p0 (w) > 1. Panel A of Fig. 4 plots c(w) for γ = 2, 4.
The MPC mF B = 0.057 for γ = 2, which is higher than mF B = 0.052 for γ = 4. The less
risk-averse entrepreneur consumes more (when ψ < 1). Panel B of Fig. 4 plots the MPC out
of wealth, CW (K, W ) = c0 (w). Note that the MPC CW = c0 (w) is not monotonic in w; it first
increases with w and then decreases with w. With sufficiently large slack w (w ≥ −0.556 for
γ = 2 and w ≥ −0.397 for γ = 4), the MPC c0 (w) decreases with w, which implies a standard
concave consumption function induced by incomplete markets frictions. However, with low
slack w (w ≤ −0.556 for γ = 2 and w ≤ −0.397 for γ = 4), the flexible exit/liquidation
is sufficiently in the money and causes the entrepreneur’s consumption rule to be convex in
that region. This finding shows that the standard concave consumption function (Carroll
23

and Kimball, 1996) is not robust to a more general incomplete-markets environment where
the entrepreneur has the exit option and is sufficiently constrained.

Entrepreneurial entry: Career choice and firm size
We have studied the agent’s decision making and valuation after becoming an entrepreneur.

However, what causes the agent to become an entrepreneur and when? These are clearly
important questions. We analyze two cases: first, a time-0 binary career decision and then
a richer model allowing for the choice of entry timing.

6.1.

When career choice is “now or never,” a binary decision

First, we consider the case where the agent has a time-0 binary choice to be an entrepreneur or take the outside option. By taking the outside option, the agent collects a
constant perpetuity with payment rΠ, which has present value Π. The agent’s optimal consumption and portfolio choice problem gives the value function V (W0 + Π) where V ( · ) is
given in Eq. (26).
By being an entrepreneur, the agent incurs a fixed start-up cost Φ and then chooses the
initial project size K0 . Wealth immediately drops from W0 to W0 −(Φ + K0 ) at time 0. Note
that the entrepreneur can borrow up to lK, the liquidation value of capital, which implies
W0 ≥ Φ + (1 − l)K0 .

(54)

To rule out the uninteresting case where the entrepreneur makes instant profits by starting
up the business and then immediately liquidating capital for profit, we require l < 1.
The agent chooses K0 to maximize value function J(K0 , W0 − (Φ + K0 )), which is equivalent to maximizing CE wealth P (K0 , W0 − (Φ + K0 )) by solving
max
K0

P (K0 , W0 − (Φ + K0 )) ,

(55)

subject to the borrowing constraint (54). Let K0∗ denote the optimal initial capital stock.
Finally, the agent compares P (K0∗ , W0 − (Φ + K0∗ )) from being an entrepreneur with W0 + Π,
and makes the career decision. The following theorem summarizes the main results.

24

Theorem 2. At time 0, the agent chooses to be an entrepreneur if and only if the initial
wealth W0 is greater than the threshold wealth level W 0 , which is given by
W0 =

Φp0 (w∗ ) + Π
,
p0 (w∗ ) − 1

(56)

and w∗ is the solution of the following equation,
p0 (w∗ ) =

p(w∗ )
.
1 + w∗

(57)

The entrepreneurial firm’s initial size K0∗ is given by
K0∗ =

W0 − Φ
.
1 + w∗

(58)

The entrepreneur’s CE wealth is then given by
P (K0∗ , W0 − Φ − K0∗ ) = p(w∗ )K0∗ = p0 (w∗ ) (W0 − Φ) ,

(59)

where w∗ is given by Eq. ( 57). After starting up the firm, the agent chooses consumption,
portfolio allocation, and firm investment/liquidation decisions as described by Theorem 1.
The optimal initial wealth-capital ratio, given by w0 ≡ (W0 − Φ)/K0∗ − 1 = w∗ , is
independent of the fixed start-up cost Φ and outside option value Π, as we see from Eq. (57).
The agent’s certainty equivalent wealth at time 0 is then given by
E(W0 ) = max{W0 + Π, p0 (w∗ ) (W0 − Φ)} .

(60)

Being an entrepreneur is optimal if and only if W0 ≥ W 0 , where W 0 is given by Eq. (56).
Insert Fig. 5 here.
Fig. 5 plots the firm’s initial size K0∗ and the CE wealth E(W0 ) as functions of initial
wealth W0 for two levels of risk aversion, γ = 2, 4. We set the outside option value Π = 0.5
and the fixed start-up cost Φ = 0.05. First, risk aversion plays a significant role in determining
entrepreneurship (see Panel A of Fig. 5). The threshold for the initial wealth W 0 to become
an entrepreneur increases significantly from 2.86 to 4.60 when risk aversion γ increases from
two to four. Second, entrepreneurs are wealth constrained and the initial wealth W0 has
a significant effect on initial firm size K0∗ . The initial firm size K0∗ (W0 ) increases linearly
25

by 1.57 for each unit of increase in W0 , provided that W0 ≥ W 0 = 2.86 when γ = 2,
while K0∗ (W0 ) increases linearly only by 1.07 for each unit of increase in W0 , provided that
W0 ≥ W 0 = 4.60 when γ = 4. Finally, the marginal effect of initial wealth W0 is also higher
for less risk-averse entrepreneurs. The CE wealth increases by 1.2 with W0 for γ = 2, and
increases by 1.12 with W0 for γ = 4 (see Panel B of Fig. 5).

When career choice is flexible: Optimal entry timing

With flexible entry timing, we show that the option to build up financial wealth is highly
valuable for the agent. For simplicity, we assume that becoming an entrepreneur is irreversible. Let F (W ) denote the agent’s value function before becoming an entrepreneur.
Using an argument similar to our earlier analysis, we conjecture that F (W ) is given by
(bE(W ))1−γ
F (W ) =
,
1−γ

(61)

where b is the constant given by Eq. (17) and E(W ) is the agent’s CE wealth.
We will show that the entrepreneurship decision is characterized by an endogenous cutoff
c . When Wt ≥ W
c , the agent immediately enters entrepreneurship. Otherwise,
threshold W
the agent takes the outside option, builds up financial wealth, and becomes an entrepreneur
c . We summarize the main results below.

The value-matching condition (63) states that E(W ) is continuous at the endogenously
c . The smooth-pasting condition (64) gives the agent’s optimal
determined cutoff level W
c . Finally, being
indifference condition between being an entrepreneur or not with wealth W
indebted with amount Π implies that the agent will never get out of the debt region and
cannot pay back the fixed start-up cost Φ. Thus, the CE wealth is zero as given by Eq. (65).
Insert Fig. 6 here.
Fig. 6 graphs E(W ) − (W + Π), the difference between the certainty equivalent wealth
by being an entrepreneur and that by taking the outside option. The two convex curves
correspond to the case where the agent has the timing flexibility (the “American” option),
while the straight lines correspond to the case where entry is a “now-or-never” binary choice
(the “European” option). First, the flexibility to optimally time entry is quite valuable.
The timing flexibility significantly increases the cutoff wealth threshold of becoming an

Explicit solution for the expected utility case. Consider the widely used expected isoelastic
utility, which is a special case of Epstein-Zin recursive utility with γ = 1/ψ. It turns
out that our entrepreneurship entry part of the optimization problem is analogous to the
optimization problem in Farhi and Panageas (2007), where an agent optimally chooses when
to stop receiving a constant income stream in exchange for a terminal (retirement) value
function.21 Following Farhi and Panageas (2007) and their online appendix, we use the
convex duality approach to derive closed-form solutions for the optimal entry threshold and
consumption/portfolio rules. We next report these results.

Idiosyncratic risk premium
A fundamental issue in entrepreneurial finance is to determine the cost of capital for

private firms owned by nondiversified entrepreneurs. Intuitively, the entrepreneur demands
both the systematic risk premium and an additional idiosyncratic risk premium for nondiversifiable risk. Compared to an otherwise identical public firm held by diversified investors,
the cost of capital should be higher for the entrepreneurial firm. Using our model, we provide
a procedure to calculate the cost of capital for the entrepreneurial firm.
Let ξ(w0 ) denote the constant yield (internal rate of return) for the entrepreneurial firm
until liquidation. We have made explicit the functional dependence of ξ on the initial wealthcapital ratio w0 = W0 /K0 . By definition, ξ(w0 ) solves the following valuation equation:
Z τ

−ξ(w0 )t
−ξ(w0 )τ
Q(K0 , W0 ) = E
e
dYt + e
lKτ ,
(74)
0

where τ is the stochastic liquidation time. The right side of Eq. (74) is the present discounted
value (PDV) of the firm’s operating cash flow plus the PDV of the liquidation value using
the same discount rate ξ(w0 ). The left side is the “private” enterprise value Q(K0 , W0 ) that
we have obtained earlier using the entrepreneur’s optimality.
28

Recall that the firm’s discount rate under complete markets, ξ F B , is given in Eq. (23).
We measure the idiosyncratic risk premium as the wedge between ξ(w0 ) and ξ F B
α(w0 ) = ξ(w0 ) − ξ F B = ξ(w0 ) − r − β F B (µR − r) .

(75)

There is much debate in the empirical literature about the significance of this private equity
risk premium. For example, Moskowitz and Vissing-Jørgensen (2002) show that the riskadjusted returns to investing in a U.S. non-publicly traded equity are not higher than the
returns to private equity. Our model provides an analytical formula to calculate this private
equity idiosyncratic risk premium.
Insert Fig. 7 here.
Fig. 7 plots the idiosyncratic risk premium for two levels of risk aversion, γ = 2, 4. For
sufficiently high levels of wealth-capital ratio w0 , the idiosyncratic risk premium α(w0 ) eventually disappears. Intuitively, this premium α(w0 ) is higher for more risk-averse agents.
Quantitatively, for entrepreneurs with positive wealth, we do not find a significant idiosyncratic risk premium. For both γ = 2 and γ = 4, the annual idiosyncratic risk premiums are
less than 1%. Importantly, for entrepreneurs in debt, the idiosyncratic risk premium α(w0 )
is much larger because the entrepreneurial business carries significantly more weight in the
portfolio, and nondiversifiable risk becomes much more important. Near the endogenous
liquidation boundary w, the entrepreneur attaches a much lower valuation for the business,
which implies a much larger idiosyncratic risk premium α(w0 ). For example, the annual
private equity idiosyncratic risk premium α(w0 ) approaches to 0.0465 and 0.0475 for γ = 2
and γ = 4, respectively. Despite the significant difference in the coefficient of risk aversion γ,
the two premiums are quite close as the risk-adjusted liquidation likelihoods for both cases
are very high.
Our theory suggests that to better measure the size of private equity idiosyncratic risk
premium (an important empirical debate in the entrepreneurship literature), it is critical to
account for heterogeneity across entrepreneurs. Our model shows that even for the same
entrepreneur, the idiosyncratic risk premium varies significantly with leverage, financial constraints and historical performance due to incomplete markets frictions.

29

Comparative analysis
There is significant heterogeneity in terms of preferences and production technology. In

this section, we study the effects of various structural parameters, including the EIS ψ,
idiosyncratic volatility , the adjustment cost parameter θ, and the liquidation parameter
l, on the entrepreneur’s decision making and business valuation. For all the figures, we use
parameter values given in Table 1 except for the parameter under study. In the preceding
analysis, we have shown that risk aversion has substantial effects. We now turn to the effects
of other key parameters. Throughout this section, we set risk aversion γ = 2.
The EIS ψ. In asset pricing, a high EIS is often used in the long-run risk literature (Bansal
and Yaron, 2004).However, there is much disagreement about the empirical estimates of the
EIS. For example, Hall (1988), using aggregate consumption data, obtains a much smaller
estimate. Our previous calculations are based on ψ = 0.5. We now consider two commonly
used but significantly different values for the EIS: ψ = 0.25, 2. Fig. 8 shows that the effect of
the EIS ψ on consumption c(w) is quantitatively significant, while its effects on Tobin’s q(w),
investment i(w), portfolio choice x(w), and the idiosyncratic risk premium α(w) are much
less significant. The large effect on consumption is similar to the intuition under complete
markets. For example, the MPC mF B is only 0.014 when ψ = 2, which is substantially lower
than the MPC mF B = 0.072 when EIS is ψ = 0.25. Intuitively, an entrepreneur with a high
EIS (ψ = 2) is willing to decrease consumption to build up wealth.
Insert Fig. 8 here.
Idiosyncratic volatility . In Fig. 9, we plot for two values of the idiosyncratic volatility,
 = 0.1, 0.2. We find that the idiosyncratic volatility  has significant effects on investment
i(w) and Tobin’s q(w). The entrepreneur invests significantly less in the firm (lower i(w))
and liquidates capital earlier when  = 0.2 than when  = 0.1. Panousi and Papanikolaou
(2011) find that the firm’s investment falls as its idiosyncratic risk rises, consistent with our
model’s prediction. Firm value q(w) increases significantly when the idiosyncratic volatility 
decreases from 0.2 to 0.1. The marginal value of financial wealth q 0 (w) also strongly depends
on the idiosyncratic volatility, especially for low and intermediate values of w. Finally, the
effect of  on the idiosyncratic risk premium α(w) is large. For example, when doubling
30

the idiosyncratic volatility from 10% to 20%, the annual idiosyncratic risk premium for an
entrepreneur with no liquid wealth (w = 0) increases from 0.5% to 2.3%!
Insert Fig. 9 here.
Adjustment cost parameter θ. In Fig. 10, we plot for two values of the adjustment cost
parameter: θ = 2 and θ = 8. Whited (1992) estimates this parameter to be around θ = 2.
Hall (2004) argues that the parameter θ is small using U.S. aggregate data. Eberly, Rebelo,
and Vincent (2009) use an extended Hayashi (1982) model and provide a larger empirical
estimate of this parameter value (close to seven) for large Compustat firms. Clearly, the
adjustment cost has a first-order effect on investment i(w) and Tobin’s q(w) under incomplete
markets, as in the first-best benchmark. Consumption c(w) and portfolio allocation x(w)
depend little on θ. The effect of θ on the idiosyncratic risk premium α(w) is weak.
Insert Fig. 10 here.
Liquidation parameter l. In Fig. 11, we plot for two values of the liquidation parameter,
l = 0.6 and l = 0.9. We show that liquidation value has a quantitatively significant impact on
investment i(w), Tobin’s q(w), consumption c(w), and the idiosyncratic volatility α(w) when
the entrepreneur is in debt (i.e., the left sides of each panel). A higher value of l provides a
better downside protection for the entrepreneur and also allows the entrepreneur to borrow
more (higher debt capacity). The entrepreneur thus operates the business longer with a
higher l. Additionally, while running the business, the entrepreneur invests more, consumes
more, and allocates more to the market portfolio with a higher value of l. A higher value
of l also lowers the idiosyncratic risk premium α(w) by providing a better downside risk
protection and mitigating entrepreneurial underinvestment. When the liquidation option is
sufficiently out of the money (i.e., when w is sufficiently high), liquidation has almost no
effect on entrepreneurial decision making and valuation, consistent with our intuition as in
the first-best benchmark.

Conclusion
We build a unified incomplete-markets entrepreneurship model with nondiversifiable

risk and liquidity constraints to analyze interdependent business entry, capital accumulation/growth, portfolio choice, consumption, and business exit decisions. The core of our
model is the entrepreneur’s dynamic liquidity and risk management. The entrepreneur rationally reduces business investment, prudently uses debt, lowers consumption, and scales
back portfolio investment in the stock market in order to preserve liquid wealth to buffer
productivity shocks. The key variable is the ratio between liquid wealth and illiquid physical
capital, which we refer to as liquidity w.
We develop the counterpart of the modern q theory of investment for firms run and
owned by nondiversified entrepreneurs. We show that investment depends on not just the
entrepreneur’s marginal q but also the marginal value of liquid wealth. Time-series variation
of investment and marginal q may arise not just from time-varying investment opportunities
but also the time-varying liquidity w. Additionally, we show how capital adjustment costs
and incomplete markets interactively influence the entrepreneur’s portfolio allocation among
the market portfolio, the risk-free asset, and the illiquid business exposure. We also provide
an operational procedure to compute the private equity idiosyncratic risk premium, which
helps us understand the empirical findings on the private equity premium.22
While being exposed to significant risk, the entrepreneur nonetheless has various options
to manage risk. The liquidation option substantially enhances the entrepreneur’s ability to
manage downside risk. Importantly, the exit option makes investment, marginal value of
liquid wealth, and the (private) marginal q all nonmonotonic in liquidity w.
The value of building up financial wealth before entering entrepreneurship is high. Wealth
effects are significant for entrepreneurship. The entrepreneurs’ various entry and exit options are illiquid/non-tradable, and fundamentally different from standard options in finance.
Additionally, option exercising decisions intertwine with consumption-saving, portfolio allocation, and investment decisions in the presence of these incomplete-market frictions.
To study the impact of entrepreneurship on wealth distribution and economic growth,
we need to construct a general equilibrium incomplete-markets model.23 Our model treats

informational or contracting frictions as exogenously given. Extending our model to allow
for endogenous under-diversification and incomplete markets is an important direction for
future research.24 Our decision model may provide one natural starting point for general
equilibrium analysis with and without informational frictions.

24

Rampini (2004) introduces informational frictions into an equilibrium model of entrepreneurship and
shows that entrepreneurial activity is pro-cyclical due to risk considerations.

Using the homogeneity property of J(K, W ), we obtain Eqs. (39) and (41) for c(w) and x(w),
respectively. Using the FOCs for investment-capital ratio i, we obtain Eq. (40). Substituting
these results into Eq. (29), we obtain the ODE (34).

Now consider the lower liquidation boundary W . When W ≤ W , the entrepreneur

J(K, W ) = V (W + lK) ,

(A.4)

where V (W ) given by Eq. (26) is the agent’s value function after retirement and with
no business. The entrepreneur’s optimal liquidation strategy implies the following smoothpasting condition at the endogenously determined liquidation boundary W :
JW (K, W ) = VW (W + lK) .

(A.5)

Using W = wK, Eqs. (A.4)–(A.5), and simplifying, we obtain the scaled value-matching
and smooth pasting conditions given in Eqs. (37) and (38), respectively.
Complete-markets benchmark solution. As w approaches infinity, firm value approaches the
complete-markets value and limw→∞ J(K, W ) = V (W + q F B K), which implies Eq. (36).
The CE wealth P (K, W ) = p(w)K, where p(w) is given by
pF B (w) = w + q F B .

(A.6)

Substituting the above into Eq. (34), taking the limit w → ∞, and simplifying, we obtain
formulae for b and mF B given in Eqs. (17) and (21), respectively. Other results follow.

Appendix B.

Details for Theorem 2 and Theorem 3

Theorem 2. The entrepreneur chooses initial size K0∗ to maximize utility, which implies
PK (K0∗ , W0 − Φ − K0∗ ) = PW (K0∗ , W0 − Φ − K0∗ ) .

(B.1)

Simplifying Eq. (B.1) gives Eq. (57). Apply the Euler’s theorem for P (K, W ), we have
∗
× (W0 − Φ − K0∗ ) = p0 (w∗ ) (W0 − Φ) ,
P (K0∗ , W0 − Φ − K0∗ ) = PK∗ × K0∗ + PW

(B.2)

where the second equality follows from Eq. (B.1). Therefore, the threshold level W satisfies
J(K0∗ , W − (Φ + K0∗ )) = V (W + Π), which gives Eq. (56).
Theorem 3. Using the standard principle of optimality for recursive utility (Duffie and
Epstein, 1992), the following HJB equation holds for the agent’s value function F (W ),
0 = max f (C, F ) + (rW + (µR − r)X + rΠ − C)F 0 (W ) +

Using value function (61) for F (W ), we obtain formulae (66) and (67) for C(W ) and X(W ),

Fig. 1: The entrepreneur’s scaled certainty equivalent wealth p(w), private average q(w) =
p(w) − w, private marginal value of liquid wealth PW (K, W ) = p0 (w), and private marginal
q, PK (K, W ) = p(w) − wp0 (w). For the first-best (complete-markets) case, marginal q and
Tobin’s average q are equal and constant, q F B = 1.31, and the marginal value of liquidity
p0 (w) = 1 for all w. With incomplete markets, the private average q is concave in w in
the region w ≥ w
e and convex in w when w ≤ w,
e where w
e is the inflection point at which
00

q (w)
e = p (w)
e = 0. As the entrepreneur’s risk aversion γ increases from 2 to 4, the shapes
of the private average q(w) and of the private marginal value of liquidity p0 (w) remain
unchanged, but the inflection point w
e changes from -0.658 to -0.495, and the endogenous
liquidation/exit boundary w changes from -0.8 to -0.65 (more risk-averse entrepreneurs use
1
lower debt and exit risky business earlier). The private marginal q, PK , is highly nonlinear
and can exceed the first-best q F B in the debt region (w < 0). Unless otherwise noted in the

Fig. 2. Investment-capital ratio i(w) and investment-liquidity sensitivity i0 (w). For the firstbest (complete-markets) case, the investment-capital ratio is constant at all times, iF B =
0.156. With incomplete markets, the investment-capital ratio i(w) is lower than the first-best
value iF B . Notably, investment-capital ratio i(w) is nonmonotonic in w; it is increasing in
w in the region w ≥ w
e and decreasing in w in the region w ≤ w,
e where w

the inflection point w

Fig. 3. The entrepreneur’s “effective” risk aversion h(w) and market portfolio allocationcapital ratio x(w). For the first-best (complete-markets) case, effective risk aversion h(w)
equals the coefficient of relative risk aversion, h(w) = γ; and the optimal portfolio allocation,
x(w), is linearly increasing in w. With incomplete markets, effective risk aversion h(w) is
highly nonlinear and nonmonotonic in liquidity w. In the region where w ≥ −0.584 for
γ = 2 and w ≥ −0.437 for γ = 4, h(w) decreases with w as self insurance becomes more
effective. In the region where w ≤ −0.584 for γ = 2 and w ≤ −0.437 for γ = 4, h(w)
decreases as w decreases towards the exit option. Near the exit boundary w, h(w) can be
lower than the coefficient of relative risk aversion γ due to the flexibility/optionality of exit,
p00 (w) > 0. The portfolio allocation to the risky market portfolio x(w) is lower than the firstbest level xF B (w). As the exit option becomes deeper in the money, i.e. as w approaches the
liquidation boundary w, portfolio allocation becomes more aggressive. For example, x(w)
is decreasing in w when w ≤ −0.684 for γ = 2 and when w ≤ −0.509 for γ = 4. Unless
otherwise noted in the legend, all parameter values are given in Table 1.

Fig. 4. Consumption-capital ratio c(w) and the MPC out of wealth c0 (w). For the firstbest (complete-markets) case, consumption-capital ratio cF B (w) is linearly increasing in w,
which implies a constant marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of liquid wealth. With
incomplete markets, the consumption-capital ratio c(w) is lower than the first-best level
cF B (w) for a given value of γ. For w ≥ −0.556 for γ = 2 and w ≥ −0.397 for γ = 4, the
MPC out of liquid wealth decreases in w, which implies that the consumption function is
concave in this region. Surprisingly, the MPC c0 (w) increases for w ≤ −0.556 for γ = 2 and
w ≤ −0.397 for γ = 4. The convexity of the consumption rule c(w) in the region w ≤ −0.556
for γ = 2 and w ≤ −0.397 for γ = 4 is due to the flexible liquidation/exit option. Unless
otherwise noted in the legend, all parameter values are given in Table 1.

Fig. 6. The value of flexible entry: Comparing the value function differences under “optimal
timing” and “time-0 binary” settings. This graph plots E(W ) − (W + Π), the difference
between the certainty equivalent wealth by being an entrepreneur and the outside option
value W + Π. The two convex curves correspond to the case where the agent has the
timing flexibility (the American option). The two straight lines correspond to the case
where entry is a now-or-never binary choice (the European option). The flexibility to time
entry is valuable. The cutoff wealth threshold of becoming an entrepreneur increases from
c = 4.3 for γ = 2, and from W0 = 4.6 to W
c = 5.7 for γ = 4 as we change
W0 = 2.86 to W
the entry option from time-0 only (European) to flexible optimal timing (American). A less
risk-averse agent is more entrepreneurial; with the timing option, the optimal cutoff wealth
c = 5.7 for γ = 4, which is significantly higher
threshold of becoming an entrepreneur is W
c
than W = 4.3 for γ = 2. Unless otherwise noted in the legend, all parameter values are

Fig. 7. Private equity idiosyncratic risk premium, α(w), for the coefficient of relative

liquidity w. As w approaches ∞, self insurance is effective and hence α(w) disappears. As
w gets into the debt region and especially when it approaches the endogenous liquidation
boundary w, the idiosyncratic risk premium α(w) becomes much larger and also much more
sensitive to the change of w. Risk aversion increases α(w). Unless otherwise noted in the
