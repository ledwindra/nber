ABSTRACT
This paper constructs a multi-sector model to take explicit account of the very sharp change in the
relative price between non-IT and IT goods. The model is calibrated to the Japanese economy, and
its solution path from 1990 on is compared to Japan's macroeconomic performance in the 1990s.
Compared to the one-sector analysis of Japan in the 1990s in Hayashi and Prescott (2002), our model
does slightly better or just as well in accounting for Japan's output slump and does worse in
accounting for the capital-output ratio. We also show that, to revive a 2% long-term growth in
percapita GDP, Japan needs to direct 10% of private total hours to the IT sector.

Introduction

We live in a world where IT goods, such as computers and communications equipments, are
continuously getting cheaper than the rest of the goods, at a relentless rate. As shown in Figure
1 for Japan, the relative price of IT goods to non-IT goods in 2000 is one-eightieth of what it was
in 1960.1

Figure 1: Relative Price of IT Goods in Terms of non-IT Goods (year 2000 = 1)

The rapid change in the relative price creates potentially serious problems for the one-good
world of macroeconomics. The Hicks aggregation theorem, which allows a bundle of many
goods to be treated as if it is a single good, is no longer valid. If the relative price of two goods
is not constant, the utility function and the production function must have those two goods
as separate arguments. One could invoke the theory of aggregation of heterogenous capital
goods to have a single variable representing capital in the production function, but that single
index, called the capital services index, is different from the simple sum of the capital stocks, as
Jorgenson and Griliches (1967) first pointed out.
For both the (aggregated) capital stock and the capital services index, the growth rate is a

weighted averages of the growth rates of individual capital stocks. The weights are the value
shares for the capital stock and the user-cost shares for capital services. The difference can be
substantial when non-IT capital and IT capital are to be aggregated. IT capital’s user cost is
much higher than non-IT capital’s because IT capital depreciates fast physically and in value. If
the stock of IT capital is growing fast, the growth rate of capital services is higher than that of
the capital stock by a substantial margin, even if IT capital’s value share is small. In the growth
accounting typically practiced in macroeconomics, the contribution of capital is measured by the
growth rate of the aggregated capital stock. The TFP (total factor productivity) growth calculated
by the macro growth accounting, therefore, confuses genuine TFP growth with the contribution
of IT capital to the growth of capital services.
Hayashi and Prescott (2002) showed that Japan’s great stagnation in the 1990s is wellaccounted for by the standard neoclassical growth model with a TFP slowdown in the 1990s.
Their one-good model, however, does not explicitly take into account the relentless decline in the
relative price of IT goods. It is possible that the decline in TFP growth, which is the cornerstone
of their analysis, is contaminated by the confusion with capital services and the capital stock.
The purpose of this paper is to do a multi-sector version of the Hayashi-Prescott one-sector
exercise. Besides government, there are two market sectors — non-IT and IT sectors — and the
household sector producing service flows from owner-occupied housing and consumer durables.
By definition, the TFP growth for household and government is zero. In Section 2, we present
our multi-sector accounting system matching this multi-sector model. Our data shows, not
surprisingly, that the TFP growth in the IT sector is much higher than that in the non-IT sector.
We confirm in Section 3 that the TFP growth rate by the macro growth accounting is indeed
higher than the genuine TFP growth, which a weighted average of the sectoral TFP growth rates.
However, the two TFP growths show similar movements, with a marked decline in the 1990s.
Section 4 presents the multi-sector growth model. It distinguishes between non-IT capital and
IT capital in the production function. In Section 5, following Hayashi and Prescott (2002), we
calibrate the model to the Japanese economy in the 1984-89 period and report results from the
simulation of the model from year 1990 on. The multi-sector model does well in accounting for
the output slump of the 90s but less well than the one-sector model for the rise in the capital-

3

output ratio in the 1990s. The model’s prediction about the long-run output growth depends
on how much resources are directed to the IT sector. If the allocation of hours between non-IT
and IT sectors remains at the (97.2%, 2.8%) breakdown of year 2000, the long-run percapita GDP
growth rate is 1.1%. To raise it to 2.0%, the private labor allocation must move in favor of IT,
from (97.2%, 2.8%) to (90%, 10%). Section 6 is a brief conclusion.

2.

The Multi-Sector Accounting Framework

The theoretical model to be presented later in the paper is a multi-sector model with two market
sectors (non-IT and IT goods-producing sectors) and two non-market sectors (the household
and government sectors). This section describes how the model’s empirical counterpart, a
multi-sector accounting system, is constructed. Its production account is derived from the 47sector system developed in Jorgenson and Nomura (2005) (hereafter, JN).2 Its final demand
components, too, are from the KEO Database.

builds on the 43-sector KEO Database, which is a comprehensive productivity database for the Japanese economy

maintained at the Keio Economic Observatory (KEO), Keio University, Japan. It consists of a time-series of inputoutput tables and detailed inputs of capital and labor. See Kuroda, Shimpo, Nomura, and Kobayashi (1997) for a
detailed documentation. From the 43 industries in the KEO database, JN separates out three IT producing industries —
computers, communications equipment, and electronic components — to form 47 industries.

4

By way of establishing the notation, Table 1 shows value added (also called net output in
the productivity literature) at producer prices and their breakdown into factor costs for the
four sectors. We define the IT sector ( j=2) as consisting not only of the three IT industries in
JN’s 47 industries (which are computers and peripherals, communications equipment, and electronic components), but also of computer software. The software sector is defined narrowly as
computer programming and other software services: custom software, pre-packaged software,
own-account software, games, and other software, excluding data processing and other related
information services.3
Real value added of the IT sector, Y2t , is the translog index of value added of these four
industries.4 Similarly, we define real value added of non-IT sector Y1t as the translog index
of value added of all the industries except the IT sector, household, and government sectors.
The price indexes of value added at producer prices, P jt (j = 1, 2), are derived by dividing the
aggregated nominal value added by real value added in each sector.
As in JN (Jorgenson and Nomura (2005)), the household sector produces rental service of
owner-occupied housing and consumer durables with no labor input. Those rental services are
consumed by the household sector itself, by definition. Nominal production, PHt YHt , equals
factor costs, which consist entirely of the user costs of owner-occupied housing and consumer
durables. The government sector produces government service that is consumed by the government itself, by definition. The imputed nominal value of government services, PGt YGt , is defined
3 We

estimate the output and inputs of computer software sector as follows. In the Japanese 2000 benchmark input-

output table produced by Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, production activity of
software sector is not divided from information services (851201), although the commodity of software (8512011) is
separated. We estimate production of the software sector using the activity in 851201. The own-account software is not
included in the production of software (8512011) of the Japanese 2000 benchmark IO table and still is not capitalized
in the Japanese National Accounts by Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), Cabinet Office. For output and
inputs of own-account software, we use the estimates in Nomura (2004b).

general, let Y jt and P jt be real value added and the associated price index of sector j in period t. The translog

quantity index Yt is defined as

X
∆ ln Yt =

v̄ jt ∆ ln Y jt ,
j

where ∆ ln Yt ≡ ln Yt − ln Yt−1 and v̄ jt is the two-period average share of sector j’s nominal value added in total nominal
value added.

as capital costs and the value of labor input, where capital costs include not only consumption
of public capital but also total capital service cost of publicly owned capital. Table 2 report
sectoral shares of nominal value added. The imputed prices of value added P jt for those two
nom-market sectors ( j=H,G) are defined by dividing nominal value added by the quantities Y jt
(j=H,G), which are defined in Equation (2.5) below.5

Note: Shares in percents. Values in parentheses represent shares of IT producing
sector excluding software.

Various capital assets can be divided into two groups, depending on their sectoral origin.
The non-IT capital or asset 1 is those assets produced in the non-IT sector, while the IT capital or
asset 2 are produced in the IT sector.6 Since value added is at factor costs, it can be divided into
payments to asset 1 (non-IT capital), asset 2 (IT capital), and labor. We use vKijt for the factor share
5 In

JN, the government and household sectors have intermediate inputs to produce their non-market services. In

this paper, to simplify the production functions, we treat these intermediate inputs as government consumption and
household consumption of non-IT good (i=1) at the final demand, respectively, so that there is no intermediate inputs
for these sectors.
6 In

JN, the most detailed asset classification has 102 assets. Of those 102 assets, to reflect the definition of the

IT sector mentioned above, the IT capital in this paper is composed of electronic computer and peripherals, wired
communication equipment, wireless communication equipment, other communication equipment, custom software,
pre-packaged software, and own-account software.

Capital and Labor
Each sector utilizes many different capital assets. At the most detailed level of asset classification,
the real capital stock and capital services are identical. However, when assets are aggregated
into broader classes, the two are not the same, as first pointed out by Jorgenson and Griliches
(1967). The real capital stock is the simple sum (valued at some base year prices) of those assets
that belong to the broader asset class in question, while capital services aggregated over those
assets is an index (e.g., the translog index) constructed from the user costs and the real capital
stocks of those assets. The user costs of capital fully reflect the heterogeneity in productivity
within the broader asset class.
For the 47 sectors, JN calculated the real capital stock and the translog index of capital
services for non-IT and IT assets.7 Those quantities are aggregated into our four broader sectors
(j = 1, 2, H, G) to obtain the real capital stock and the translog capital services index for the
7 The

user costs in JN incorporate the Japanese tax structure. The detailed formula is given in Nomura (2004a, ch.3),

where he considers capital consumption allowance, income allowance and reserves, special depreciation, corporate
income tax, business tax, property tax, acquisition taxes, debt/equity financing, and personal taxes on capital gain and
dividend. Nomura (2004a, ch.3) measures effective tax rates and tax wedges, based on estimated before-tax and after-tax
rates of return. This estimate gives the effective tax rate for capital income τkt in our model.

non-IT and IT assets. For asset i (i=1 for non-IT or 2 for IT) in sector j in period t, we use Kijt
∗
for the real capital stock and Ki∗jt for the capital services index.8 The ratio QKij ≡ Kijt
/Kijt , which

converts real capital stock into capital services, is called the capital quality in the productivity
literature. It captures the heterogeneity within the asset class mentioned above. Going back to
Table 1, the rental rate ri jt is defined to satisfy the relationship
P jt ri jt Kijt = nominal value of capital services for asset i in sector j.

(2.1)

By definition, for any sector j ( j = 1, 2, H, G), the IT capital stock K2jt and IT capital services
K2∗ jt do not include land. Land would be in non-IT capital, but we do not include land in K1jt
and K1∗ jt ; see below for how we account for land as non-IT capital. Despite the exclusion of land
from K1jt , the rental rate r1jt of non-IT capital includes land rent.
The labor equivalent of real capital stock is total hours worked. Labor input differs from
hours worked because it is an index of labor inputs of various kinds, distinguished by worker
characteristics such as education. JN calculated total hours worked and the translog index of
labor input for the 47 industries.9 We can aggregate those quantities into our four broader sectors
(j = 1, 2, H, G). We use L jt for total hours worked in sector j and L∗jt for the translog index of
labor services. The labor quality QLjt (j=1,2,G) is L∗jt /L jt . Nominal hourly wage rate in sector j, W jt ,
is defined to satisfy
W jt L jt = nominal labor costs in sector j.

Productivity
To account for the role of land in the measurement of TFP (total factor productivity), we introduce
∗
, into one
a variable, ϕ jt , which converts the translog capital services index without land, K1jt

with land for sector j. For each sector, we can define two measures of TFP growth, one (the
“pseudo” TFP growth) that takes neither the capital and labor quality nor land into account (vTjt )
and the one (the “genuine” TFP growth) that does (vT∗
). They are defined as

vTjt = ∆ ln Y jt −

where v̄Kijt and v̄Ljt are the two-period average cost shares of capital and labor in value added. So

Both versions of TFP growth recognize the heterogeneity in productivity between the non-IT and
IT capital. The genuine TFP growth further takes into account the heterogeneity within each
broad asset class. It also incorporates the labor heterogeneity and the contribution of land.
Quantities of services produced by the household and government sectors are defined as the

sectors are zero. The pseudo TFP growths, vTjt ( j=H,G) differ from 0, thanks to the exclusion of
quality change and land. For the two market sectors (non-IT and IT sectors), Figure 2 displays

the genuine TFP growth vt

( j = 1, 2). The rapid IT productivity growth is in stark contrast to

the stagnation of the non-IT sector. As noted in Jorgenson and Nomura (2005), the IT growth
has accelerated in the second half of the 1990s. The dotted line in the Figure is the TFP growth
of the IT sector when software is not included. The inclusion of software, while raising the
value-added share of the IT sector in the 1980s and after as shown in Table 2, pulls down the
TFP growth.

The components of domestic final demand are in Table 6. Household consumes non-IT goods
(C1Ht ) and own-produced rental services of consumer durables and owner-occupied housing
(YHt ). C1Ht includes intermediate inputs to household production YHt . Similarly, C1Gt includes
intermediate inputs to government production of services YGt . The output of the IT sector is not
consumed.

Our estimate of consumption is based on the time-series of input-output tables in the KEO

consumption tax rate τct is calculated as the ratio of the total value of net indirect tax to P1t C1Ht .
Investments are calculated from the fixed capital formation matrix in Nomura (2004a).
Physical depreciation rates δi jt for asset i in sector j are aggregated from the depreciation
rates for 95 produced assets and 16 consumer durables used in JN. For each asset i (i = 1, 2), the
depreciation rate can differ across sectors and over time because the asset composition within
each sector varies. Nevertheless, the aggregated depreciation rates reported in Table 7 are fairly
uniform across sectors, except for the non-IT asset of government, which includes infrastructure.

Aggregation over Sectors and Assets

We have calculated, in Table 5, the TFP growth for each sector and the private sector as a whole
that takes into account the heterogeneity between the two assets (non-IT and IT capital). In
contrast, the growth accounting in the macro literature (see, e.g., Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare
(2001) and Hayashi and Prescott (2002) (hereafter HP)) is so wedded to the one-sector paradigm
that the aggregate capital input is defined simply as the value of nominal capital stock deflated by
the output deflator. In this section, we apply this ”macro” growth accounting to the multi-sector
dataset described in the previous section.
For real private GDP (real aggregate value added) at factor costs, we use the translog index.
That is, let (P jt , Y jt ) be the value-added deflator and real value added in sector j (j = 1, 2, H) from
our multi-sector dataset. We calculate aggregate real value added Yt as the translog index over
industry value added.10 The growth rate of private real GDP has already been reported in Table
5. The implicit GDP deflator is defined as the ratio of nominal aggregate value-added to Yt .
The solid line in Figure 3 is real GDP per working-age population (the number of persons
aged 20-69) thus calculated from our multi-sector system, detrended at 2% (which has been the

also calculated the Fisher chain index and found it to be virtually identical to the translog index.

long-run growth rate for the leader country (the U.S.) over the past century) and normalized to
100 for 1990. It shows that real private GDP Yt grew much faster than 2% until 1991 but slower
than 2% thereafter. Just to show that the basic picture remains the same, the Figure also shows, in
the dotted line, the similarly detrended official real GDP per worker from the Japanese national
accounts (on the SNA93 basis).11 There are a number of definitional differences between our
GDP and the official Japanese SNA93 GDP: the official SNA93 GDP includes the government
sector while our GDP doesn’t; our GDP is a (translog) chain index while the official GDP is a
fixed-weight Paasche index;12 service flows from consumer durables are included in our GDP,
and so forth. Compared to the official GDP, our measure shows slightly less growth in the 1980s
and a slightly severer slump in the 1990s.
Another macro variable of interest is the capital-output ratio. The macro growth accounting
typically uses the GDP deflator to convert nominal into real. That is, the aggregate capital stock
Kt is defined as the ratio of the total nominal value of the capital stocks in sectors 1, 2, and H
to the GDP deflator defined above. So the capital-output ratio Kt /Yt equals the ratio of private
11 The SNA refers to the System of National Accounts.

The SNA93 is a set of rules and standard for national accounting

recommended by the United Nations in 1993.
12 Currently,

the official SNA93 chain index is available only since 1994.

from our multi-sector dataset. It shows a 25% rise from 2.62 in 1990 to 3.28 in 2000. The official
capital-output ratio, with the capital stock as well as nominal GDP from the Japanese SNA93, is
the dotted line. It is much lower and shows a much slower rise in the 1990s. The most important
reason for the difference is that the depreciation rates in our multi-sector accounting system are
lower.13

Other reasons include

the following. Our measure of nominal capital stock does not equal the nominal capital stock valued at investment
goods prices. Own-account software and pre-packaged software are included in our measure of the capital stock.

(3.3)

Our measure of aggregate labor Lt is aggregate hours worked in the three private sectors. Table
8 shows the HP growth accounting applied to our multi-sector dataset with θ = 0.362 (the
capital share parameter used in HP). Despite the substantial differences in the definition, the
overall picture is the same as in HP: both per capita output growth and the TFP growth slowed
down to less than 1%, the capital-output ratio increased, and labor input declined in the 1990s.
Comparing the “macro” TFP growth (the growth rate of At ) in this table to the aggregate TFP
growth reported in Table 5 (see the column labeled “private” for either the pseudo TFP or the
genuine TFP), we see that the “macro” estimate is biased upward, although the movement over
time is similar.

The Two-Sector Growth Model with Consumer Durables

This section presents our theoretical model to be confronted with the data from the multi-sector
accounting system. Main features of the model are the following.
• Consistent with the multi-sector accounting system, there are two market-provided goods
(non-IT goods and IT goods) and two non-market goods (government services and household
services). The IT goods are not consumed. Government services do not enter the household’s
utility function.
• The two market goods (non-IT and IT goods) are internationally tradable. We assume that
the country is small enough not to influence the relative price of IT goods in terms of non-IT
goods. This means that the relative price is exogenous to the model.
• Unlike in HP (Hayashi and Prescott (2002)), where the capital stock includes claims on the
rest of the world, we separate external assets from domestic capital. The time path of external
assets is treated as exogenous. This means that both net income from abroad and net exports
are exogenous to the model.14
• Unlike in HP, labor supply is exogenous. The sectoral allocation of total labor, too, is exogenous. We are forced to make this assumption because the market equilibrium is one of
near-complete specialization under the observed relative price if labor is allowed to move
freely between sectors.
We now turn to a more detailed description of the model.

Households
The stand-in household’s utility function is
∞
X

βt Nt u(c1t , dt ), β ∈ (0, 1),

(4.1)

t=0

where Nt is working-age population, c1t is per-worker consumption of good 1 (the non-IT good),
and dt is the service flow (from owner-occupied housing and consumer durables) produced by

from national income accounting that the net increase in external assets equals the current account and that

the current account is the sum of next exports (the trade balance) and net income from abroad.

17

the household. If Kit is the quantity of private capital stock i obtained from investment in good
i (i = 1, 2), the household sets aside µit Nt dt of it as capital input for producing Nt dt units of
household services. These capital input requirement coefficients (µ1t , µ2t ) depend on the rental
rates of capital (see below). We allow two distorting taxes, the consumption tax (the tax rate: τct )
and the tax on capital income (τkt ). Labor supply is exogenous to the model, so the tax on labor
is not distortionary and is lumped into the lump-sum tax τht . The household’s budget constraint
is
(1 + τct )Nt c1t + [K1,t+1 − (1 − δ1 )K1t ] + Pt [K2,t+1 − (1 − δ2 )K2t ] + (FAt+1 − FAt )
≤ w1t L1t + w2t L2t + wGt LGt + [r1t (K1t − µ1t Nt dt ) + Pt r2t (K2t − µ2t Nt dt )]

(4.2)

− τkt [(r1t − δ1 )(K1t − µ1t Nt dt ) + Pt (r2t − δ2 )(K2t − µ2t Nt dt )] − τht + NIt ,
where Pt is the relative price (the price of good 2 in terms of good 1), δi is the depreciation rate of
asset i, FAt is foreign assets in terms of non-IT goods (good 1), w jt is the wage rate measured in
good 1 paid by sector j, L jt is labor supply to sector j, rit is the rental rate for asset i (so the rental
price in terms of good 1 of asset 2 equals Pt r2t ), and NIt is net income from abroad measured in
good 1.15
In terms of the notation of Tables 1 and 6, Pt = P2t /P1t , c1t = C1Ht /Nt , dt = YHt /Nt , w jt = W jt /P1t ,
Ki,t+1 − (1 − δi )Kit = Ii1t + Ii2t + IiHt (i = 1, 2), and µit Nt dt = KiHt (i = 1, 2). In the data, the rental
rate ri jt depends on sector j because of the asset heterogeneity within the broader asset classes of
non-IT and IT capital, but in the model, which does not recognize this heterogeneity, the rental
rate does not depend on j.
Let βt Λ−1
t be the Lagrange multiplier. Being the reciprocal of the shadow price of the budget
constraint, Λt measures the wealth of the household. The FOCs (first-order conditions) for
15 This

budget constraint implies that the household does not pay the consumption tax on purchases of non-IT and IT

goods to be used for household production. If this counterfactual assumption is to be avoided, we would have to treat
those flow of durables purchases separately from investments in the capital stock to be rented out to firms, but that adds
another co-state variable to the system. Our numerical procedure for computing the perfect foresight equilibrium path
cannot handle more than one co-state variable.

The first of these two equations will be referred to as the Euler equation because it describes how
the household wealth Λt evolves over time. The second equation will be called the arbitrage
condition governing the portfolio of the two assets K1t and K2t .
We can solve (4.3) and (4.4) for (c1t , dt ) as a function of the consumption tax rate τct , the
imputed price (Pdt ), and the shadow price Λt :
(Frisch demands)

c1t = c1 (τct , Pdt , Λt ), dt = d(τct , Pdt , Λt ).

(4.10)

This demand system, with the shadow price Λ replacing income, is called “Frisch demands”.
Use of Frisch demands enforces the household FOCs (4.3) and (4.4) in the equilibrium conditions.
The input requirement coefficients (µ1t , µ2t ) for producing household services can be made
endogenous, as the solution to the cost minimizing problem:17

where Fd is a linear homogeneous production function for household services, QKiHt (i = 1, 2) is
the capital quality defined in Section 2 to capture the asset heterogeneity, and ϕHt is the factor
accounting for land in asset 1. By definition, there is no TFP growth in household production,
so the production function is stationary. We write the solution as

where Kijt is the amount of privately-held asset i rented by sector j in date t and A∗jt is the level of

the quality of labor in sector j, and the factor ϕ jt accounts for land. The FOCs are

The Government
The government collects taxes to finance government expenditure in goods and services (the
sum of government consumption and investment) in two goods, G1t and G2t , and payments to
hire labor LGt used for producing government services. The lump-sum tax τht is adjusted to
meet the government budget constraint. In terms of the notation of Table 6, G1t = C1Gt + I1Gt
and G2t = I2Gt . Neither the government production function nor breakdown of government
expenditure between consumption and investment needs to be specified, because it does not
affect the equilibrium of the private sector.

20

Market Equilibrium
The market equilibrium conditions are:

(RC)

(asset 1)

K11t + K12t + µ1t Nt dt = K1t ,

(4.16)

(asset 2)

K21t + K22t + µ2t Nt dt = K2t ,

(4.17)

Nt c1t + [K1,t+1 − (1 − δ1 )K1t ] + Pt [K2,t+1 − (1 − δ2 )K2t ]

(4.18)

= (Y1t − G1t ) + Pt (Y2t − G2t ) − NXt .
Here, the label “RC” stands for resource constraint and NXt is net exports in terms of good 1.

Equilibrium
We can now define competitive equilibrium. Take as given:
• a government policy {K1Gt , K2Gt , LGt , G1t , G2t , τct , τkt }∞
,
t=0
• labor supply to each sector {L1t , L2t }∞
,
t=0
• external assets {FAt }∞
and net exports {NXt }∞
,
t=0

,
• the relative price {Pt }∞

• the capital and labor quality and the land conversion factor {QKijt , QLjt , ϕ jt }∞
(i = 1, 2; j =

1, 2, H, G),
• the technology level {A∗1t , A∗2t }∞
.
t=0
A competitive equilibrium given an initial condition (K10 , K20 ) is a sequence of factor prices,
{r1t , r2t , w1t , w2t }∞
, the household wealth {Λt }∞
, and associated quantities, {K1,t+1 , K2,t+1 , K11t , K12t ,
t=0
t=0
K21t , K22t }∞
, such that the Euler equation (4.8), the arbitrage condition (4.9), the firm’s FOCs
t=0
(4.15), the market equilibrium conditions ((4.16)-(4.18)) are satisfied, where (Y1t , Y2t ) in those
conditions are given by (4.13) and (4.14), c1t in the RC (resource constraint) and dt in the asset
market equilibrium condition are given by (4.10), and (µ1t , µ2t ) in the asset market equilibrium
condition are given by (4.12).
In this definition, the government budget constraint is not an equilibrium condition, because
the lump-sum tax τht is assumed to meet the constraint. The household budget constraint is
21

not included, because it is implied by the government budget constraint, the factor exhaustion
condition that value added equals factor payments (an implication of the linear homogeneity
of the production function and the marginal productivity conditions), the market equilibrium
conditions, and the identity that the increase in external assets, FAt+1 − FAt , equals net exports
NXt plus net income from abroad NIt .

Implications of The Cobb-Douglas Technology
In what follows, we assume the Cobb-Douglas form for the production functions. So (4.13) and
(4.14) can be written as

(4.21)

This shows that, for the Cobb-Douglas technology, the production function can be defined for
the capital stocks, with an appropriate re-definition of the TFP term. The growth rate of A∗jt is the
”genuine” TFP growth rate, vT∗
, of Section 2. The above expression of the production function
jt
makes it clear that what matters for equilibrium is the “pseudo” TFP growth rate, vTjt , which
equals the growth rate of A jt defined here.
We will also assume the Cobb-Douglas form for the household production function Fd in
(4.11):


1−γ

Fd (ϕHt QK1Ht K1Ht , QK2Ht K2Ht ) = A∗H ϕHt QK1Ht , K1Ht QK2Ht K2Ht

(4.23)

The utility function u(c1t , dt ) is linear logarithmic:
u(c1t , dt ) = µ log(c1t ) + (1 − µ) log(dt ).

(4.24)

With these functional-form assumptions for household, the Frisch demands (4.10) and the de-

22

mand for capital inputs for household production (4.12) become
(Frisch demands)

c1t =

(4.26)

K1Ht ≡ µ1t Nt dt =

(4.27)

Thanks to the unit elasticity in both the demand for and the supply of household services, a
change in AHt does not affect the demand for assets µit Nt dt in household production. Combining
(4.22), (4.26), and (4.27), we obtain
1−γ

γ

Pdt YHt = Pdt AHt K1Ht K2Ht = (1 − µ)Nt Λt ,

(4.28)

which states that the value (in terms of good 1) of household production does not depend on the
pseudo TFP AHt .

Detrending
With the Cobb-Douglas technology and the linear-logarithmic preferences, it is possible to transform the system so that it involves only the growth rates, but not the levels, of the TFPs. To this
end, define two trends:
1−θ22

X1t ≡ A1t v

θ21

θ12

1−θ11

A2tv Nt , X2t ≡ A1tv A2t v

Nt with v ≡ 1 − θ11 − θ22 + θ11 θ22 − θ12 θ21 .

Define also lower-case letters as ratios to these trends:

The Transition Path and the Steady State
From this set of equations, we can define a first-order dynamical system (k1 , k2 , λ), namely a
mapping from (k1t , k2t , λt ) to (k1,t+1 , k2,t+1 , λt+1 ), as follows.
i) Given (k1t , k2t , λt ), use eight equations, (4.33)-(4.35) to solve for eight unknowns (r1t , r2t , k11t , k21t ,
k12t , k22t , y1t , y2t ). Intuitively, this enforces that the country’s marginal rate of transformation
between the two goods be equated to the world relative price. This step also gives (r1t , r2t )
as functions of (k1t , k2t , λt ). Write them as: rit = ri (k1t , k2t , λt ) (i = 1, 2).
ii) Given (k1t , k2t , λt , y1t , y2t ), use (4.37) to calculate zt+1 .
iii) Substitute ri,t+1 = ri (k1,t+1 , k2,t+1 , λt+1 ) into (4.31) and (4.32). Given the value of zt+1 ob24

tained in the previous step, three equations — (4.31), (4.32), and (4.36) — can be solved for
(k1,t+1 , k2,t+1 , λt+1 ).
The initial condition for the system is that the initial values for the two state variables (k1t , k2t )
are given. Given an appropriate initial value for the co-state variable λt , we can generate the
solution path using this mapping from (k1t , k2t , λt ) to (k1,t+1 , k2,t+1 , λt+1 ).
This dynamical system is autonomous (i.e., the mapping from (k1t , k2t , λt ) to (k1,t+1 , k2,t+1 , λt+1 )
is stationary or time-invariant) if the forcing or exogenous variables — `1t , `2t , X1,t+1 /X1t ,
X2,t+1 /X2t , Nt+1 /Nt , τkt , τct , ψ1t , ψ2t , pt , and νt — are constant over time. The steady state or
the equilibrium of this autonomous system can be determined uniquely from the above equations by dropping the time subscript, as follows. Dropping the time subscript in (4.31) pins
down r1 , the steady-state value of r1t . Given r1 , use the steady-state version of (4.32) to obtain
r2 . Given r1 and r2 , use (4.33) to calculate (k11 , k21 , k12 , k22 , y1 , y2 ). Use the rest of the equations,
(4.34)-(4.37) to pin down (k1 , k2 , z, λ).
When we simulate the model in the next section, we will assume that the exogenous variables
become constant either asymptotically (for `1t , `2t , νt ) or after some fixed date (which is year
2000 in the simulation below), so the detrended system is asymptotically autonomous. The
appropriate initial value of the co-state λt is the one that guides the detrended system to approach
the steady state in the long run (as time goes to infinity). This particular solution path satisfies
relevant transversality conditions.
Given the solution path for the detrended system, we can back out the equilibrium of the
model before detrending using (4.30). This determines:
Y1t , Y2t , K1t , K2t , K11t , K12t , K21t , K22t , r1t , r2t , Λt .
The value of household production, Pdt YHt , can be determined from this by (4.28). All these
endogenous variables are determined independent of the psudo TFP for the household sector,
AHt . The breakdown of Pdt YHt between price and quantity does depend on AHt and can be
obtained from (4.26).
The steady-state or the balanced growth path associated with the steady-state or the equilibrium of the detrended system has the following features.
25

• The sectoral allocation of capital for each asset i (i = 1, 2) is constant, because the trend in Kijt
does not depend on j.
• Obviously,
Y1t ∝ X1t , Y2t ∝ X2t , Pt (≡

X1t
P2t
)∝
, Nt Λt ∝ X1t .
P1t
X2t

(4.39)

Thus if, as is the case in the calibrated model below, X2t grows much faster than X1t thanks
to the rapid IT productivity growth, the relative price of IT goods declines rapidly and the
growth of relative output level Y2t /Y1t is as rapid as the decline in the relative price.

P2t = P1t Pt and PHt = Pdt Pt for some arbitrary path of P1t (which doesn’t affect the index),
and let vYj be the steady-state value of the value-added shares discussed above. Then the
steady-state growth rate of real private GDP is given by
vY1 × gX1 + vY2 × gX2 + (1 − vY1 − vY2 ) × (γgX1 + (1 − γ)gX2 + gH ),

(4.42)

where gX j is the long-run growth rate of X jt and gH is the long-run growth rate of AHt .
• From the firm’s marginal productivity conditions, the wage ratio w1t /w2t under the CobbDouglas technology equals

1−θ11 −θ21 Y1t /L1t
1−θ21 −θ22 Pt Y2t /L2t

for all t. In the steady state, it equals

w2t

(4.43)

where (p, `1 , `2 ) are the constant long-run values of (pt , `1t , `2t ). It can be easily seen from
tracing out the procedure for calculating the steady state explained above that y1 /`1 and y2 /`2
26

do not depend on (`1 , `2 ) (an implication of the constant-returns-to-scale technology and the
small country assumption). Thus the steady-state wage ratio between non-IT and IT sectors
does not depend on the allocation of labor between the two sectors.
We close this section by commenting on our assumption that the relative price (Pt ≡ P2t /P1t ),
which is internationally given, is projected to grow at precisely the rate given by X1t /X2t , which
is determined by the domestic TFP growth rates in non-IT and IT sectors (see (4.29)). This is
not as far-fetched as it might seem. As Jorgenson (2003) finds, the rapid decline in IT prices is
common to G7 countries. If, as Jorgenson and Nomura (2005) argue, this relentless decline is
rooted in developments in technology (primarily in semiconductors) that are widely understood
by technologists and economists, it would not be too unrealistic to assume that the TFP growth
rate in the IT sector in Japan is as high as it is elsewhere in the world.

5.

Calibration and Results

The detrended dynamical system described in the previous section has a set of parameters and
exogenous variables. In this section, we calibrate the detrended system and specify the paths
of exogenous variables. We will then discuss the steady-state properties of the system. The
equilibrium of the model in levels can be obtained by solving the detrended system and then
multiplying the solution by appropriate time trends. The last part of this section examines
the transition dynamics thus calculated. As in Hayashi and Prescott (2002), the calibration is
based on data for 1984-1989 in principle, and the transition dynamics is set off from 1990. The
presumption of this simulation exercise is that the representative agent learns, all of a sudden
in 1990, about the paths of the exogenous variable from 1990 on. The prior expectations about
the exogenous variable from 1990 on are whatever is consistent with the 1984-89 values of the
endogenous variables of the model.

27

Calibration
The detrended dynamical system has nine parameters (β, µ, γ, δ1 , δ2 , θ11 , θ21 , θ12 , θ22 ). These
parameters are calibrated as follows.
θij (i, j = 1, 2): These are capital shares, whose values for selected years are reported in Table 3
for the non-IT and IT sectors. Given that β is estimated from the 1984-1989 data (see below),
we should use the 1984-1989 averages. However, as seen from the Table, the factor shares of
IT assets tend to increase in the 1990s. For this reason, we use the 1990-2000 averages.
γ: It is non-IT capital’s (asset 1’s) share in household production. Its values for selected years
are reported in Table 3 for the household sector. We use the 1990-2000 average.
µ: From the parameterized Frisch demands (4.25), µ equals (1 + τct )P1t YHt /((1 + τct )P1t C1Ht +
PHt YHt ). We use the 1990-2000 average; the 1984-89 average is similar.
δi (i = 1, 2): The depreciation rate for each asset differs slightly across sectors in data, as shown
in Table 7. For each asset and for each year, we take the weighted average of the depreciation
rates over three sectors, j = 1, 2, H, with the capital stocks of that asset in three sectors as
weights. We then use their 1990-2000 averages for δi (i = 1, 2). The calibrated values thus
calculated are: δ1 = 6.8% and δ2 = 30.5%. The IT capital depreciates much faster. Again, their
1984-89 averages are similar.
β: From the Euler equation (4.8), the parameterized Frisch demands (4.25), and the marginal
productivity condition for asset 1 in sector 1 under the Cobb-Douglas production function,
we can derive
(1 + τct )P1t C1Ht + PHt YHt

Y1t
= β[1 + (1 − τk,t+1 )(θ11
− δ1 )] with Λt =
.

K11t
P1t Nt

(5.1)

Following Hayashi and Prescott (2002), we take the sample average over 1984-1989 of both
sides of this Euler equation and then solve for β. In taking the sample averages, θ11 and δ1
are year-dependent values in data, not the calibrated values of them.
There are eleven exogenous variables in the detrended system: the growth rates of (X1t ,
X2t , Nt ), the relative price (pt ), the two tax rates (τkt , τct ), exogenous labor ratios (`1t , `2t ) (where
28

` jt = L jt /Nt ), the government-expenditure-to-GDP ratios (ψ1t , ψ2t ), and the net export-to-GDP
ratio (νt ). Their values from year 1990 to 2000 are set to their actual values. Their paths beyond
year 2000 are projected into the future as follows.
` jt (allocation of hours): We consider two scenarios for the labor ratios `1t ≡ L1t /Nt and `2t ≡
L2t /Nt . In either scenario, the total hours devoted to the private sector, `1t + `2t =

L1t +L2t
Nt ,

are as

in the data for t = 1990, 1991, ..., 2000, and remains at its year 2000 value for t > 2000. The two
scenarios differ in the allocation of private total hours between non-IT and IT,

` jt
`1t +`2t

=

L jt
L1t +L2t

( j = 1, 2), for t = 2001, 2002, ....
Scenario A The allocation is the same as in 2000.

That is,

L1t
L1t +L2t

=

L1,2000
L1,2000 +L2,2000

for t =

2001, 2002, .... As shown in Table 4, the ratio in 2000 is 97.2% for non-IT and 2.8% for
IT.
Scenario B The allocation gradually converge from (97.2%, 2.8%) to (90%, 10%). More specifically, for t = 2001, 2002, ...,
`2t − `2,t−1

!
L1,2000 + L2,2000
L1,2000 + L2,2000
= 0.1 × 0.9 ×
− `1,t−1 , `1t =
− `2t .
N2000
N2000

The steady-state distribution of 90% of private total hours for non-IT and 10% for IT is
chosen because it implies a steady-state real private GDP growth of about 2.0%.
Nt (working-age population): We assume zero growth, so Nt = N(2000) for t = 2001, 2002, ....
X1t and X2t : They are the time trends defined in (4.29) and depend on the “pseudo” TFP levels,
A1t and A2t defined in (4.21). For the non-IT sector (j = 1), we assume no productivity growth,
so A1t = A1,2000 for t = 2001, 2002, .... For the IT sector, we set the growth rate of A2t after 2000
to the average growth rate in 1995-2000. As Dale Jorgenson forcefully argues in his recent
writings (see, e.g., Jorgenson (2003) for G7 countries, Jorgenson and Nomura (2005) for Japan
in particular) and as verified in Table 5 and Figure 2, the TFP growth in the IT sector has
accelerated after 1995. We are thus assuming that this acceleration after 1995 was anticipated
in 1990 and that the enhanced IT growth is expected to continue into the future.
τkt (tax rate on capital): Its conceptually appropriate definition is the so-called effective tax rate
on income from capital, which includes taxes on capital at both the corporate and personal levels
29

and incorporates various other features of the tax code such as accelerated depreciation, taxfree reserves. As mentioned in footnote 7, this tax rate was calculated in Nomura (2004a). The
value beyond 2000 is set equal to its 2000 value of 50.0%, which is close to the crude estimate
of 48% used in Hayashi and Prescott (2002).
τct (consumption tax rate): Its measurement was already discussed in Section 2. The value
beyond 2000 is its 2000 value (9.8%). The tax rate is higher than the statutory rate of 5%
because the tax base is assumed to be P1t C1Ht , which is narrower than the actual tax base.
ψit (government share of good i): The values beyond 2000 are the 2000 values.
pt (the relative price): The detrended relative price in data does not show a trend since 1970.
The value beyond 2000 is set at its average over 1990-2000. As discussed at the end of the
previous section, this amounts to assuming that the differential in TFP growth between non-IT
and IT is common to all countries in the world.
νt (net exports/GDP ratio): The country’s foreign asset measured in non-IT goods, FAt , evolves
according to
FAt+1 = (1 + rt )(FAt − NXt ),
where rt is the interest rate on foreign assets. Letting fat ≡ FAt /(Y1t + Pt Y2t ), this equation can
be written as
1
fa = fat − νt , 1 + r̃t ≡
1 + r̃t t+1

1 + rt
Y1,t+1 +Pt+1 Y2,t+1
Y1t +Pt Y2t

.

We assume that this 1 + r̃t is constant and is equal to the ratio of 1.05 to 1.007 (one plus the
long-run growth rate of X1t ). The value of νt beyond 2000 is set as:
νt = −0.01 + xt−2000 × (ν2000 + 0.01) for t = 2001, 2002, ....
This x is set so that the present discounted value of νt (t = 2000, 2001, ...) with the discounting
factor of 1/(1 + r̃t ) equals fa2000 . We take FA2000 to be the nation’s external assets at the end of
1999 (84.735 trillion yen in nominal terms). x thus calculated equals 0.9422. Thus, the trade
balance is assumed to gradually declines to −1% of GDP (excluding household production).
As explained in the previous section, the path of AHt (the pseudo TFP for household production) does not affect the detrended system, but it does affect the breakdown of Pdt YHt (value of
30

household production in terms of good 1) between price and quantity. We assume no change in
AHt beyond year 2000. The calibrated parameter values and projected growth rates are shown
in Table 9.

Results
Under the calibrated parameter values and projected path of exogenous variables, we can numerically solve (i.e., simulate) the model as explained in detail in the previous section. We first
examine the steady-state properties of the model solution. Table 10 reports our steady-state
results under the two scenarios about the allocation of private total hours between non-IT and
IT sectors. As explained in the previous section, the steady-state value of the wage ratio w1t /w2t
does not depend on the allocation of private hours. Under our calibration of the model, it equals
0.9670. So there is no strong incentive for workers to emigrate between non-IT and IT sectors in
the steady state. As shown in the table, the steady-state percapita GDP growth rate depends on
the given allocation of labor. This is because the sectoral allocation of labor affects the sectoral
31

allocation of value added. The “macro” capital-output ratio, on the other hand, is not sensitive
to the labor allocation.

different steady-state growth rates under the two scenarios, the detrended path of real GDP
diverges eventually, as shown in the Figure, but the difference is not apparent until around
2003. For either scenario, the model’s ability to track GDP is rather impressive. The model
does far worse for the capital-output ratio (K/Y), as seen in Figure 6. The simulated K/Y under
either scenario echoes the rapid rise in data, but the rise is not steep enough. Compared to the
one-sector model of Hayashi and Prescott (2002), our multi-sector model is less able to account
for K/Y. One possible reason is our assumption that labor allocation is exogenous. Shutting
down the labor margin reduces returns from investment.

Conclusion

We have constructed a multi-sector growth model that takes explicit account of the differential
TFP growth rates between non-IT and IT goods. Our model is capable of accounting for Japan’s
output slump in the 1990s, and is less successful than the one-sector model of Hayashi and
Prescott (2002) in accounting for the sharp rise in the capital-output ratio in the 1990s.
Can IT be Japan’s savior? What this paper has done is merely provide an accounting frame33

work for answering the question. We have provided a mapping from the labor allocation and the
relative price between non-IT and IT sectors to the long-run GDP growth rate. To endogenize the
labor allocation and the relative price and to thereby determine the country’s industry structure,
one would need a dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin model composed open economies.
