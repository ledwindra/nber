    "abstract": "\n\nThe stem-and-leaf display is a natural semi-graphic technique to include in statistical computing systems. This paper discusses the choices involved in implementing both automated and flexible versions of the display, develops an algorithm for the automated version, examines various implementation considerations, and presents a set of semi-portable FORTRAN subroutines for producing stem-and-leaf displays.\n\n",
    "acknowledgement": "\nThe present implementation of stem-and-leaf displays have evolved from the earlier one-line per-stem versions programmed by Michael D. Godfrey for the instructional computing package SNAP/IEDA on the IBM7094 and refined by Hale F. Trotter when SNAP/IEDA was converted to the IBM 360. We are also indebted to Paul W. Holland, Paul F. Velleman, and Roy E. Welsch for articu1ating the needs of a variety of users, to Neil E. Kaden and Virginia Klema for va1uble discussions of semi-portability, and to Stephen C. Peters for assistance in testing and debugging.\n\n\n"
