Inflation, Portfolio Choice, and the Prices of Land
and Corporate Stock

ABSTRACT

This paper presents an explicit model of portfolio demand and uses
it to show how the rate of inflation and its variances affect the real prices

of land and of common stock. The analysis is thus an extension of two of the
author's earlier papers which studied how the interaction of inflation and

tax rules alter the real prices of land and stock. The analysis shows the
importance of going beyond the traditional assumption that net—of—tax yields
are equated for all assets.

Inflation, Portfolio Choice, and

the Prices

of Land and Corporate Stock

Martin Feldstein*

During the rapid inflation of the past decade, the price of land has not
only kept its real value but has increased far more rapidly than the general

price level.' While elementary economic theory would predict that land and all
other real assets would hold their real value when the price level rose, the
increase in the relative price of land caught economists as well as others by
surprise.

The reasons for the rise in the relative price of land are multiple and

complex. They range from the rise in the world price of food to the political
instability in the Middle East and the fears of political change in Western

Europe. No single paper, let alone a short theoretical one, could hope to
provide a full explanation.

There is, however, a fundamental link between general price inflation

and the relative price of land that deserves particular attention. This relation
is the opposite side of the same coin that causes inflation to depress the price

of common stock. In essence, inflation and the tax laws interact to raise the
return on land and lower the return on reproducible capital.2 The prices of

iarvard t5niyersity and the Nationa Bureau of Economic Research.

price of farm land rose at an annual rate of 13 percent, nearly double the 7.4
percent annual rise in the general consumer price index.

this paper, I

use the

capit-al and ignore owner—occupied

term reproducible capital to refer to business
housing. In many ways, owner occupied housing

behaves like land in its response to inflation.

—2—

these

assets must then adjust to the new inflation expectation to make investors

willing to hold both types of assets in the initially existing quantities. This
requires the price of land to rise (relative to the general price level) and the
price of reproducible capital to fall.
If uncertainty could be ignored, the price changes would be such that the
real after—tax rates of return were equal both before and after any change in the

rate of inflation. A model of asset demand that makes this simple arbitrage
assumption and ignores uncertainty can however be very misleading. The present
paper presents an explicit model of portfolio demand and uses it to show how the
rate of inflation and its variance affect the real prices of land and capital.
The present paper is thus an extension of two earlier studies in which I
presented models of how the interaction of inflation and the tax rules alter
the real prices of land (Feldstein, 1979) and common stock (Feldstein, 1980a).
Although these papers considered the role of uncertainty in a rather ad hoc way,
a formal model of portfolio choice derived from utility maximization was lacking.
The purpose of the present paper is to remedy that deficiency.
A basic result of the earlier papers (as well as of the present analysis)
is that changes in tIe rate of inflation alter the relative price of assets while
at any constant inflation rate the equilibrium real asset prices remain unchanged.
Thus an unanticipated jump in the expected rate of inflation causes an immediate

jump in the level of the land price. After this initial jump, the price of
land increases at the same rate as the general rate of inflation.
This
land

during

interpretation implies that the

continuous increase

in

the price of

the 1970's can best be thought of as a combination of (1) many

small changes in the equilibrium real price of land (as the expected rate of
general price inflation changed) and (2) a continuing increase in the nominal

price of land at the prevailing rate of inflation. Similarly, the fall in the

—3—

real value of share prices combines a series of falls in the equilibrium real
price of shares with continuous increases in their nominal price.
The first section of this paper presents the model of portfolio equilibrium while the second section derives the means and variances of the asset

yields. The price equations for land and reproducible capital are then developed
in section 3. The fourth section derives the comparative static results for

changes in inflation and in the uncertainty of inflation. A brief concluding section discusses some of the implications of this work and possible
directions for further research.

1. A Model of Portfolio Equilibrium

The economy that I shall describe consists of identical individuals1
who hold a short term nominal asset, (1tbillst), land, and (reproducible) capital.

The current price level and current inflation rate are known but the rate of

inflation in the future is unknown. For simplicity, it is easiest to think of
the economy switching from one expected inflation rate to another.2

The aggregate stocks of both land and capital are assumed fixed. While
this may be a realistic approximation for land,3 it is clearly not an appropriate
4

model for capital. If the market price of existing capital assets falls below
replacement cost, the size of the capital stock will fall while a market price of

ecisting assets above their replacement cost will cause an increase in net
investment. The anticipation of the future change in the size of the capital
stock will change the expected future yields per unit of capital and labor.
That in turn will influence the initial changes in the prices of these assets.
While it would clearly be desirable to incorporate this effect into the analysis,
the combination of dynamic price adjustments and explicit portfolio choice under

uncertainty is a more complex problem than I can currently solve.5 I have chosen
'The assumption of identical individuals ignores another important feature
that belongs in a more complete model of portfolio choice: differences in tax
rates among investors. The distinction between taxable individual investors and
tax exempt institutions can be particularly important in understanding the effect
of inflation on portfolio investment (Feldstein, l980a,b).
2The idea of an expected time pattern of future inflation rates might be
more realistic hut would be more complex to analyze without adding any fundamen-tally new insights.
3The effective stock of land can change through the loss of topsoil,
forestation, etc.

5Poterba (1980) and Sumniers (1980) have extended the type of analysis
presented in Feldstcin (1979, 1980a,b) to include an explicit capital stock
adjustment process with feedback onto the path of asset prices. They assume
certainty and therefore that the yields of all assets are always equated, at
least up to a constant.

to focus on the portfolio choice aspect but I recognize the importance of
extending the specification to incorporate the dynamic general equilibrium
response.

Consider an individual i whose initial holdings of land, capital and

money are L.
1 units of land, K.1 units of capital and B. dollars of treas—
1

ury bills. These holdings reflect some previous set of expectations about asset
yields and the associated covariance matrix. When the Hicksian "week" begins,
there is a new set of expectations (possibly but not necessarily identical with

the old ones). These expectations imply a set of equilibrium asset prices
and

relative to the numeraire; the purpose of this section is to derive

equations for these equilibrium prices.

The individual's initial endowment is thus B. + p L. + p K. and must

be redivided among new holdings (B., L. and K.) according to the wealth
constraint:

is the return per week per unit of land, RK — 1

and RB — 1

,

Thus

each unit of

is the return on capital,

is the rate of interest. All of these are to be regarded as

real after—tax rates of return. The returns to land and capital are uncertain
while

the bill

return is riskless.1 The individual's wealth at the end of

the week is thus:

Wi = RLL. + RKK. + RB.

If each individual has the same quadratic utility function, expected

utility can be written as a linear combination of the mean and variance of W.:

The Means and Variances of Asset Yields

I turn now to the derivation of the mean real net—of—tax returns on the
three assets and the corresponding covariance matrix.

Consider first the real net rate of return on bills. If the nominal

short term rate is r , the personal tax rate is 0 , and the active current
inflation rate is ii

, the

RB = (1 —

(13)

real net—of—tax rate of return is

0)r

—

it

Because the tax is levied on the nominal return, the real net of tax returns
will vary with the rate of inflation. Ever since Irving Fisher (1930),
empirical studies have confirmed that the nominal interest rate changes approximately point—for—point with sustained changes in the rate of inflation1; in the
current notation, dr/dir
I

dRB/dlr

=—

(1 — 0)

<

0;

1 is a reasonable approximation. This implies that
an increase in the inflation rate reduces the real net

return on bills. For a high enough inflation rate, the real return can be negative. This is a particularly important feature of our tax system because it
suggests that the usual assumption of equal yields on all assets may be wrong and
a poor approximation when there is substantial inflation.
The return on a unit of a land consists of an income return and a capital

gain or loss. If the marginal physical product per unit of land (per week) is
FL ,

the net—of—tax marginal revenue product is (1 — O)pFL

.

Increases in the

price of land are taxable capital gains. The capital gains tax rate is less

1See, e.g., Yohe and Karnovsky (1968) and Feldstein and Suners (1978).

—10—
than the tax rate on ordinary income and the effective tax rate is further
reduced because capital gains are taxed only when the property is sold; I

shall use the letter c to denote the accrual—equivalent effective tax
rate, i.e., the rate which levied on accruals would collect the same present

value of taxes as the actual rate levied on realizations. If the increase in
the after tax capital gain is

the price of land during the week is 1L
(1 -

The total nominal return per unit of land is thus (1 — 6)pFL + (1 —

c)L.

Since a unit of land costs L the nominal return per dollar invested in
land is (1 —

O)pFL/PL

+ (1

—

c)L/pL

.

The real rate of return is the differ-

ence between this nominal rate of return and the rate of inflation:
(1 —

O)pFL/pL

+ (1 —

c)L/pL

—

.

Finally,

the real return per unit of land

(RL) is just the product of the real rate of return and the price per unit of
land:

=

(14)

(1-

e)pFL + (1- c)L -

There are two types of uncertainty about this return, corresponding to
the income and capital gain components of the price change. Since the current
price level is known, the income uncertainty is caused by the uncertain marginal

physical product of land., If cL is the mean marginal physical product of

land and '

The return on reproducible capital also consists of an income return

and a change in the price of the asset. Because the tax rules are based on
nominal accounting definitions, a rise in the rate of inflation increases

the effective tax rate on the real income from reproducible capital.1 This
is due primarily to the required use of historic cost depreciation but also

reflects the method of inventory accounting.2 If the marginal physical

the

the absence of inflation can be written (1 —

3. The Price Equations

The means and covariance matrix of the returns on land and capital can
be used with equation 12a and 12b to obtain explicit price equations for land

and capital. It is useful to begin by substituting the mean values RB and
RL into equations 12 to obtain the price of land:

In

These results show the importance of explicitly recognizing the role

of uncertainty and risk—aversion in determining L' Equation 27 shows
that risk—aversion can eliminate the anomalous results. With

in the denominator, relative asset prices are not nearly

so sensitive to differences in the mean real net rates of return.

A more complete characterization of the real price of land is obtained

°LL and °LK are rewritten in terms of the underlying variances and
covariances. The essential features of the analysis are preserved but the

analysis is simplified by assuming that the income disturbances (3 and )

independent of each other and of the price disturbances ( and

.

Such an

assumption would be reasonable if investors knew that the disturbances

and 0 are serially independent so that a disturbance in one period has no

implications about future values of FL and FK .

assumption, the relevant variances and covariances of section 2 become:

In this form, the real price of land is defined as a quadratic function of
tax rates, rates of return, the expected inflation rate, and the total wealth

4. Some Comparative Static Analyses

Equations 33 and 34 can be used to examine how the real prices of land
and capital respond to changes in inflation, the uncertainty of future infla-

tion, etc. Since the stock of capital is assumed to remain constant,' the
results can of course only indicate the direction and not the magnitude of the
change.

Since c <

,

this

will clearly be satisfied

During the increasing inflation of the 1960's and 1970's,

the nominal interest rate rose by approximately the rise in the rate

of inflation, causing the real net interest rate to fall by (1 — 0)dir

.

In

contrast, the real return on land falls only because of the smaller rate of capi-

tal gains tax on the nominal appreciation in the value of the land. Since the
extra tax on bills per dollar of capital would exceed the extra tax on land, the
price of land rises in the absence of uncertainty in order to equalize the yields.

1See above, page 4

—19—

Introducing uncertainty leaves this conclusion unchanged but suggests

that the magnitude of the effect may be reduced. If d(pL/p)/thr < 0
dVL/dlr < 0

since VL =

PLL

and L is constant. This positive term offsets

some of the magnitude of the pure tax and interest rate effect, the economic
reason for this is that as

rises the investor has relatively more wealth

in this form which in turn raises the risk premium that the investor requires
to hold even more land or, equivalently, which reduces the demand for more land
and therefore the real price of land.
If the primary reason for the covariance between the unanticipated

changes in the prices of land and capital (c) are the unanticipated changes
in inflation, the term GdVK/dir is also likely to be positive, further
reducing d(pL/p)/dIr but nevertheless leaving it positive. For example,
dpL/dT > 0

and dpK/thr < 0

GdVK/dlT > 0
dV /di > 0

and

The economic reason (in the

is that inflation reduces the value of the

investors' reproducible capital and, since the return on capital is negatively
correlated with the return on land, reduces the demand for land and therefore
its price.

The effect of uncertainty is nevertheless to dampen the effect of infla-

tion and not to reverse it. To see this, note that the opposite implies a

contradiction. If dpL/dlr < 0

,

c

(dVL/dlr)

< 0

which implies an even larger

positive value of dpL/drr
A similar analysis shows that a higher rate of inflation reduces the

real value of capital1 and that the uncertainty and risk aversion again dampen
the magnitude of the effect.

'This depends on the relative magnitudes of the historic cost depreciation effect and the real interest rate effect.
For an analysis with realistic
parameters, see Feldstein (l980b).

The

about inflation is the source of the uncertainty about asset prices. Two
extremes will illustrate the possible results. If most of the variation in

of the variation in the price of capital reflects the inflation uncertainty,

an increase in the inflation uncertainty will raise a

5. Conclusion

This paper has focused on the specific question of how changes in
expected inflation and in its uncertainty affect the real prices of land and

of reproducible capital. The analysis shows how an explicit portfolio choice
framework can be applied to derive asset price equations and how, in the
framework, the interaction of taxes and increased inflation causes a rise in
the real value of land and a fall in the real value of corporate equities.

Two more general points are worth noting. First, the analysis shows the
inappropriateness of the common assumption that inflation is neutral, i.e., that

it does not alter real magnitudes. When there are taxes on capital income, this
is false and inflation can have substantial real effects.
Second, the traditional assumption that prices adjust until net—of—tax

yields are equal may be very misleading. In the examples shown here, the
existence of a finite price for land depends on the uncertainty of the asset
yields.

This paper has shown that an explicit utility maximization model of
portfolio choice can be applied to analyzing the effects of changes in the rate

of inflation. A natural next step is to embed this analysis in a more general
dynamic framework in which changes in the price of capital change the supply of
new capital goods and therefore the future path of the real marginal products
of capital and land.
