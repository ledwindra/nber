The trade-and-wages debate has settled comfortably into what Sherlock Holmes might
have called ‘the 20% solution.’ Using a variety of methodologies, many researchers have
demonstrated that international trade accounts for no more than a fifth of the rising inequality experienced by the United States in the last two decades e.g., Feenstra and Hanson
(1996a), Borjas et al. (1997), and Baldwin and Cain (2000). As American academic interest
in the debate wanes, it is easy to forget that the trade-and-wages debate does not stop at the
U.S. border. As some of the demonstrators in Geneva, Seattle, and Québec City remind us,
rising inequality is an issue of profound importance to the low- and middle-income countries
that constitute the ‘South.’ This Southern incarnation of the trade-and-wages debate poses
difficult challenges for international trade economists wedded to general equilibrium reasoning. Their workhorse general equilibrium model dishes up bland fare for a Southern palate,
namely, the Stolper-Samuelson theorem. The theorem states that globalization raises the
demand for unskilled Southern labor, thereby reducing inequality in Southern countries.
Unfortunately, this prediction is not borne out by the data.
For example, consider the Deininger and Squire (1996) inequality database. It has 29
developing and newly industrialized countries with non-missing data on the change in Gini
coefficients over the 1980s.

Of these 29 countries, 16 experienced rising inequality, 12

experienced falling inequality, and 1 experienced no change in inequality.

This roughly

even split between rising and falling inequality illustrates just how complex is the evolution
of Southern inequality
While this complexity calls for an alternative to Stolper-Samuelson reasoning, it offers no
guidance as to what that alternative might be. For example, there is effectively a zero corre-

lation between changes in inequality and per capita GDP. This leaves us with a frustrating
problem. If the hallmark of international trade theory is general equilibrium reasoning and
if the Stolper-Samuelson theorem is out of the picture, then what can international trade
theory contribute to our understanding of Southern inequality? Figure 1 hints at a possible
answer. For our 29 developing and newly industrialized countries, it plots the growth in
inequality against contemporaneous growth in exports. Given the uniqueness of the East
Asian experience, we break out countries into two groups, East Asia and ‘Other.’ The correlations for both groups are positive and very strong. The R2 is 0.50 for East Asia and 0.59
for the other countries. These positive correlations are neither trivial nor obvious. Indeed,
the Stolper-Samuelson logic predicts a negative relationship.
Of course, one does not want to put too much stock in figure 1. Both the inequality
and trade data are permeated with measurement errors. One also does not want to impute
causality to the displayed relationship: the results could be driven by any number of omitted
factors such as levels of openness, coincidental timing of trade reforms, and differences in
domestic re-distributive systems. Notwithstanding these concerns, the figure suggests that
general equilibrium trade linkages across countries play at least some role in the complex
evolution of Southern inequality.
To explore this role we develop a model in which the correlation between trade and
inequality is driven by Southern productivity catch-up. To this end we marry the Dornbusch
et al. (1980) model of Heckscher-Ohlin trade with the Dornbusch et al. (1977) model of
Ricardian trade. The former allows us to discuss rising wage inequality between skilled and
unskilled labor.

The latter allows us to discuss international technology differences and

2

Southern productivity catch-up.
The intellectual inspiration for our modelling is an elegant observation by Feenstra and
Hanson (1996a) that appeared in a Bhagwati festschrift. Feenstra and Hanson point out
that U.S. capital investments into Mexico pave the way for the United States to outsource its
least skill-intensive goods to Mexico. Since these goods are highly skill intensive by Mexican
standards, outsourcing raises the relative demand for skills in both Mexico and the United
States.

This in turn increases the level of inequality in both regions.

The model thus

overturns the Stolper-Samuelson prediction and replaces it with a result in which foreign
direct investment raises inequality in both Mexico and the United States.
In the model we will be presenting, there is no foreign direct investment. Instead, we
consider a general form of Southern catch-up that goes beyond physical capital accumulation.
The historical record on growth makes it clear that catching up involves far more than
just physical capital accumulation.1 In this general setting we replicate and extend the
Feenstra and Hanson result. We then show that the faster is a Southern country’s rate of
catch-up, the greater will be its rates of both inequality growth and export growth. Crosscountry differences in catch-up among Southern countries will therefore generate a positive
correlation between changes in inequality and growth in exports. That is, it will generate
the pattern illustrated in figure 1.
Note that in replicating and extending the Feenstra and Hanson result, we use a model
that incorporates important features absent from their framework. These include (1) Ri1

Without any pretensions to comprehensiveness, see for example Schultz (1960) on human capital accumulation, Gerschenkron (1962) on the advantages of being a late-comer, and Acemoglu et al. (2000) on
institutions.

cardian sources of comparative advantage, (2) richer general equilibrium feedbacks through
the trade balance, (3) substitution in production between skilled and unskilled labor, and
(4) skill biased technical change. The latter has recently been advanced as an important
fact about the South (Berman and Machin 2000). Together these modelling innovations
serve to enrich the general equilibrium feedbacks between trade and inequality.
While our paper is almost exclusively theoretical, in the penultimate section we provide a rudimentary empirical analysis based on our model. We examine the determinants
of skill upgrading for all 28 ISIC manufacturing industries operating in 18 developing and
newly industrialized countries. For each industry in each country, we measure ‘catch-up’ as
domestic labor productivity growth relative to the trade-weighted average of foreign labor
productivity growth. We include this catch-up variable in the type of skill-upgrading equation that has become standard in U.S. applications (e.g., Berman et al. 1994, Feenstra and
Hanson 1996a, 1996b, 1999, Autor et. al. 1998, Goldin and Katz 1998), but not in Southern
applications. We find that our measure of catch-up is indeed an important determinant of
skill upgrading. This provides at least some support for our claim that Southern catch-up,
via skill upgrading, has generated a positive correlation between increases in inequality and
exports, just as in figure 1.
The paper is organized as follows. Sections 1-3 set up the model. Sections 4-5 derive the
core results on catch-up, trade and inequality. The remaining sections deal with refinements
of our notion of catch-up (section 6), the relation of our work to Feenstra and Hanson (1996a)
(section 7), implications for real income and welfare in the North and South (section 8), and
a rudimentary empirical investigation (section 9). Section 10 concludes.

1. The Setup
We follow the Dornbusch et al. (1980) setup as closely as possible. There are 2 regions, North
(N ) and South (S). There are 2 factors, unskilled labor (L) and skilled labor (H). There
is a continuum of goods indexed by z with 0 ≤ z ≤ 1. Production functions are regularly
neoclassical, displaying strict quasi-concavity, constant returns to scale, and continuous
derivatives. In addition, there are no factor intensity reversals. This last assumption implies
that we can identify larger z with greater skill intensity. Goods markets are perfectly
competitive and profits are zero in equilibrium. There are no international barriers to trade
in goods. Factor markets are perfectly competitive and clear domestically. Consumers have
identical Cobb-Douglas preferences. Finally, international trade is balanced. This setup is
identical to Dornbusch et al. (1980), except for the presence of international technology
differences.
There are 2 sources of comparative advantage in our model. The first is endowments.
Let wf i be the wage of factor f (= L, H) in region i (= N, S). Let wi ≡ wHi /wLi be the
wage of skilled labor relative to that of unskilled labor. As in Dornbusch et al. (1980),
we assume that the North is sufficiently skill abundant so that wN < wS . This implies
that the North has a comparative advantage in skill-intensive goods. The second source
of comparative advantage − which does not appear in Dornbusch et al. (1980), but is the
focus of Dornbusch et al. (1977) − is Ricardian international technology differences. We
assume that these differences confer a comparative advantage to the North in skill-intensive
goods. That is, the North has relatively lower marginal costs for producing relatively more
skill-intensive goods. To express this mathematically, let Ci (wHi , wLi , z) be the unit cost
5

function for producing good z in region i. We assume that

∂CN (·, ·, z)/CS (·, ·, z)
≤ 0 for all z.
∂z

(1)

With two goods (z1 > z2 ) inequality (1) can be written as CN (·, ·, z1 )/CN (·, ·, z2 ) ≤
CS (·, ·, z1 )/CS (·, ·, z2 ). That is, it is an inequality involving 2 ratios of marginal costs, just
as in Ricardian textbook explanations of trade. The only difference is that with 2 types of
labor something must be said about factor prices. Inequality (1) compares CN and CS at
any common set of factor prices.
Lemma 1 establishes that our 2 sources of comparative advantage work in the same
direction and can be neatly integrated into a single model. All proofs appear in the appendix.
Lemma 1. Endowments-based comparative advantage (wN < wS ) and Ricardian-based
comparative advantage ( inequality 1) together imply

∂ CN (wHN , wLN , z)
<0
∂z CS (wHS , wLS , z)

(2)

for all (wHS , wLS , wHN , wLN ) such that wN < wS and for all z. That is, the North has a
comparative advantage in skill-intensive goods.
Given lemma 1 it is easy to show that for each factor price quadruplet satisfying wN <
wS , there is a unique z on the interior of the unit interval such that CN (wHN , wLN , z) =
CS (wHS , wLS , z). (See the proof of lemma 1.) It follows that CN (wHN , wLN , z) is below
CS (wHS , wLS , z) if and only if z > z. This is illustrated in figure 2. (Note that we do
6

not know anything about the individual Ci , not even monotonicity. This is because the
individual Ci deal with absolute advantage.)
It follows that even though we have an additional (Ricardian) source of comparative
advantage that does not appear in Dornbusch et al. (1980), we can still expect a similar
characterization of equilibrium. Specifically, there is a ‘competitive margin’ z such that the
North produces all goods z > z and the South produces all goods z < z. That is, the North
specializes in the most skill-intensive goods.

2. Equilibrium Conditions
To keep the notation simple, for the remainder of the paper we suppress the wHi and
wLi as arguments of functions whenever possible. We emphasize that this is a notational
convenience: we are making no assumptions about substitution possibilities in production.
Let Pi (z) be the competitive price for good z produced in region i. z is defined by

PN (z) = PS (z).

By the zero-profit condition, equation (3) is just the figure 2 crossing condition. Let Yi

where i = N for z > z and i = S for z < z.
Let Li and Hi be region i’s endowments of unskilled and skilled labor, respectively.
Let Li (z) and Hi (z) be the amount of unskilled and skilled labor, respectively, needed to
produce one unit of good z in region i. To keep the reader clear, we repeat that these
are unit demands (not total demands) and that they depend on wHi and wLi (which are
suppressed). Define hi ≡ Hi /Li and hi (z) ≡ Hi (z)/Li (z). Market clearing for Southern
skilled labor is given by

Following Dornbusch et al. (1980), we can combine the zero profit condition Pi (z) =
wLi Li (z) + wHi Hi (z) with equations such as (5) to obtain 2 equations that summarize factor
market clearing. To this end, define S(z) ≡

[x(z)LS (z)/LS ] dz.

S(z) is the excess demand for skilled labor relative to unskilled labor. With some manipulation, S(z) = 0 may be written as3

Preliminary analysis suggests that our results go through with CES preferences. Unfortunately, CES
preferences introduce additional general equilibrium feedbacks that obscure the main point. We have thus
not pursued this line of inquiry in any depth.

Following Dornbusch et al. (1980) and as detailed in appendix A.2, the search for a
competitive equilibrium can be reduced to the search for a triplet (wN , wS , z) that solves
equations (6)-(8). Lemmas 3-4 of appendix A.2 establish that there exists a unique equilibrium. Further, if hN /hS is sufficiently large then wN < wS will be a feature of the unique
equilibrium. This completes the set-up of the model and the characterization of the unique

3. Technical Change and the Definition of Southern Catch-Up
Given the complexity of the model, including its 2 sources of comparative advantage, we
make several simplifying assumptions about the nature of technical change. For one, we
assume that it involves cost-cutting process innovation rather than product innovation.
This is in the spirit of a model geared to Southern technology catch-up. Product innovation
is taken up in Zhu (2001). Also, we assume that technical change is exogenous and uses
no real resources. Endogenizing technical change offers important insights (Acemoglu 1998,
2000), but is not our focus here.
We are interested in comparative static exercises involving technical change. Let t denote
the state of technology. Note that our model is static so that t is not an index of time. For
each t, there is a unique equilibrium and unique equilibrium outcomes wN (t), wS (t), and
z(t). Re-write factor demands and unit costs in a way that highlights their dependence on
t. Thus the Hi (z, t) and Li (z, t) are factor demands per unit of z and the Ci (wHi , wLi , z, t)
are costs per unit of z. We assume that these functions are differentiable in t and use
the convention that the Ci (wHi , wLi , z, t) are non-increasing in t i.e., technical change never
increases unit costs.
The natural measure of productivity growth in the production of good z in region i is
−∂ ln Ci (wHi , wLi , z, t)/∂t. This is just the dual of the Solow residual. We will write that

10

the South is ‘catching up’ if

γ(t) ≡

∂ ln CN (wHN , wLN , z, t) ∂ ln CS (wHS , wLS , z, t)
−
> 0.
∂t
∂t

(9)

Equation (9) states that the South is catching up if, for good z̄ = z(t), Southern productivity
rises relative to Northern productivity. We will write that the South is ‘falling behind’ if
γ(t) < 0.5
There are two problems with our definition of Southern catch-up that are more apparent
than real. First, we have defined Southern catch-up only in terms of productivity growth
for good z(t). It would be more desirable to define it in terms applicable to all Southern
goods.

However, doing so offers no additional insights. Further, it adds considerably to

the notational burden because of Hulten’s (1973) ‘path dependence’ problem. This point
is developed in section 6. Expositional simplicity thus calls for initially defining Southern
catch-up in terms of good z(t). Second, it would be nice to express technical change in terms
of a more primitive parameterization. This is done in section 6. There it is shown that
there is a 1 : 1 relationship between primitive parameterizations of Southern catch-up and
the more interpretable parameterization of equation (9). Expositional clarity thus calls for
using γ(t).
Finally, in what follows we suppress the technology argument t in wN (t), wS (t), z(t),
and γ(t). This completes the definition of Southern catch-up.
5

It might be helpful to some readers if we were more careful with the notation in equation (9). Throughout this paper, ∂Ci (wHi , wLi , z, t)/∂t denotes the derivative of Ci (wHi , wLi , z, t) with respect to its fourth
argument (t) and evaluated at (wHi , wLi , z) = (wHi (t), wLi (t), z(t)). Re-stated, the derivative holds factor
prices and z(t) constant at their initial equilibrium values.

11

4. Neutral Technical Change
In order to make the main results as clear as possible we begin by assuming that Southern
catch-up involves Hicks-neutral technical change. Skill biased technical change is dealt with
in the next section. Recall that wi is the wage of skilled labor relative to unskilled labor
in region i (= N, S). wN and wS will be our measures of inequality.6 Theorem 1 relates
Southern catch-up to changing patterns of trade and inequality.
Theorem 1. Assume that technical change is Hicks neutral.
(1) If the South is catching up (γ > 0) then dwN /dt > 0, dwS /dt > 0, and dz/dt > 0. That
is, wage inequality widens in both regions and production of the least skill-intensive
Northern goods migrates South.
(2) If the South is falling behind (γ < 0) then dwN /dt < 0, dwS /dt < 0, and dz/dt < 0.
That is, wage inequality falls in both regions and production of the most skill-intensive
Southern goods migrates North.
The way to start thinking about theorem 1 is in terms of the Feenstra and Hanson
(1996a) sorting mechanism. Referring to figure 2, Southern catch-up leads to a fall in the
CS (wHS , wLS , z, t) schedule relative to the CN (wHN , wLN , z, t) schedule. This leads to a
rise in z. In the North, the rise in z eliminates the most unskilled-intensive jobs, thereby
lowering the demand for unskilled labor. Northern inequality rises. In the South, the rise in
z creates jobs that are more skill intensive than any existing Southern jobs, thereby raising
6
With Cobb-Douglas preferences, a one precent rise in wages leads to a one percent rise in the consumption of each good. Therefore, wi is also a consumption-based measure of inequality. See Attanasio and
Davis (1996) for a discussion of such measures.

12

the demand for skilled labor. Southern inequality rises. Of course, this Feenstra-Hanson
mechanism is only part of the story. Neutral technical change has general equilibrium
effects on factor prices that lead to further shifts in the figure 2 cost curves. These general
equilibrium effects are remarkably rich. To describe them simply, in the next few paragraphs
we assume that there is no technical change in the North.
At fixed (wN , wS ), Southern catch-up makes the South absolutely more productive. This
leads to positive profits in the South. Competition for labor among Southern firms raises
the relative wage of Southern workers (wLS /wLN and wHS /wHN rise). Rising income leads
the South to import more. The result is a negative Southern trade balance. To eliminate
the trade imbalance the South increases its supply of goods and reduces its demand for
Northern goods. Both changes are facilitated by a rise in z.
Now allow (wN , wS ) to change. The rise in z eliminates the trade imbalance, but creates
Southern excess demand for skilled labor relative to unskilled labor. Rising wS eliminates
this excess demand in 2 ways. First, it leads to a within-good substitution away from
skilled labor. Second, it increases the relative price of skill-intensive goods which leads to
a between-good reallocation toward the South’s unskilled-intensive goods. Together, these 2
mechanisms clear Southern labor markets. Adjustment in the North proceeds along similar
lines.7
7

It is easy to prove that the rise in wS increases the relative price of skill-intensive goods. Let θHS (z) ≡
wHS HS (z)/ [wHS HS (z) + wLS LS (z)] be the cost share of skilled workers in the production of good z in
the South. Consider two Southern goods z1 and z2 . Differentiating the relative price of the two goods with
respect to the relative wage yields d [PS (z2 )/PS (z1 )] /dwS = θHS (z2 ) − θHS (z1 ) which is positive if and only
if z2 > z1 .

The equilibrating mechanisms set off by Southern catch-up are rich in general equilibrium feedbacks.

There is a between-country reallocation of goods from the North to

the South, a within-country reallocation of goods toward unskilled-intensive goods, and a
within-good substitution of unskilled labor for skilled labor. The mechanisms are facilitated
by equilibrating movements in the trade balance and relative prices.
We next turn to the cross-country correlation between dwS /dt and dz/dt illustrated in
figure 1. Theorem 2 provides an explanation of the correlation.
Theorem 2. dwN /dt, dwS /dt, and dz/dt are increasing in the rate of Southern catch-up
(γ). In particular, the faster is Southern catch-up, the greater is the growth in Southern
inequality and Southern exports.
Generalizing to the multi-country world of figure 1, theorem 2 suggests the following.
Southern countries with high rates of catch-up will have high rates of inequality growth
(large dwS /dt) and high rates of export growth (large dz̄/dt). Thus, differences in the
rate of catch-up among Southern countries will generate a positive cross-country correlation
between rising inequality and export growth. This is exactly as depicted in figure 1. Note
that the theorem does not require Hicks-neutral technical change.
On a technical note, dz̄/t is not quite the same as the growth in the real value of exports.
While we can also show that growth in the real value of Southern exports is increasing in
the rate of Southern catch-up (see theorem 5 below), this requires a bit more work. The
problem is that one needs to introduce price deflators in order to discuss real exports. We
therefore postpone presentation of this result until we define deflators in section 8 below.

14

To summarize, theorems 1-2 establish that figure 1 as well as rising inequality in both
the North and the South are consistent with an almost-standard trade model featuring a
combination of Ricardian and Heckscher-Ohlin elements. Theorem 1 also shows that skill
biased technical change is not necessary for rising inequality. Even with neutral technical
change, Southern catch-up can raise wage inequality in both regions.

5. Skill-Biased Technical Change
Of course, skill biased technical change is likely the single most important contributor to
rising inequality in the North (e.g., Katz and Murphy 1992, Autor et al. 1998, and Berman
et al. 1998). We therefore need to ensure that our trade-based explanation of North-South
inequality spillovers is consistent with Northern skill biased technical change.
We begin with the simplifying assumption that the rate of skill biased technical change
is the same across all goods within a region.8
Assumption 1. There exist ρN (t) and ρS (t) such that

∂
∂t



Hi (z, t)

= ρi (t) for all z and for i = N, S.

We know from Berman and Machin (2000) that the South has experienced skill upgrading
so that skill biased technical change in the South is likely also relevant. Indeed, it is their
research that has motivated much of the analysis of this section. Note that assumption 1
8

Recalling that the factor price arguments of Hi (z, t) are suppressed, by ∂ ln Hi (z, t)/∂t we will mean
the derivative of ln Hi (wHi , wLi , z, t) with respect to its fourth argument (t) and evaluated at (wHi , wLi ) =
(wHi (t), wLi (t)). Re-stated, the derivative holds factor prices constant at their initial equilibrium values.
Likewise for d ln Li (z, t)/dt.

15

is made for expositional ease in characterizing skill biased technical change and is otherwise
entirely unnecessary.9 In what follows, the dependence of the ρi on t is dropped.
Under assumption 1, dwN /dt, dwS /dt, and dz/dt are linear functions of γ, ρN , and ρS .
Specifically, letting x index wN , wS , and z,

dx
= (γ − ax ρN − bx ρS ) cx ,
dt

x = wN , wS , z

(10)

where ax , bx , and cx are functions of preferences and the level of technology, but are not
functions of the technology change parameters (γ, ρN , ρS ).
complicated.

The proof of linearity is not

(See appendix A.4.) The difficult part is the signing of the ax , bx , and cx .

Remarkably, all nine parameters can be signed.
Lemma 2. Let assumption 1 hold. Then (1) awS = az > 0, awN < 0, (2) bwN = bz > 0,
bwS < 0, and (3) cwN > 0, cwS > 0, cz > 0.
Part (3) states that the dx/dt are increasing in γ. That is, theorem 2 holds with or without
skill biased technical change. The generalization of theorem 1 to the case of skill biased
technical change is straightforward and appears in theorem 3 below. However, it is much
easier to first explain theorem 3 graphically.
Figure 3 plots the dx/dt = 0 lines in (γ, ρN )-space for the case where ρS = 0.

From

equation (10), the dx/dt = 0 lines are rays through the origin with slope ax . If follows from
lemma 2 (awS = az > 0) that the dwS /dt = 0 and dz/dt = 0 lines coincide and are upward
9
Without assumption 1, ρN (t) is replaced throughout by b2 of appendix equation (26) and ρS (t) is
replaced throughout by b3 of appendix equation (27). b2 and b3 are weighted averages across z of the rates
of skill biased technical change. The generality obtained by eliminating assumption 1 is more than offset
by the notational burden of equations (26) and (27).

16

sloping. Above these lines, Southern catch-up γ is strong enough that dwS /dt and dz̄/dt
are both positive. Why do these lines slope upward? Northern skill biased technical change
is factor augmenting and so increases the effective supply of Northern unskilled labor. This
excess supply is absorbed in part by a fall in z. This means that for ρN > 0, Southern
catch-up (γ > 0) is no longer sufficient to ensure dz/dt > 0.

Southern catch-up must

not only be present, it must be strong enough to offset the effects of Northern skill biased
technical change.
Turning to Northern inequality, lemma 2 (awN < 0) and equation (10) imply that the
dwN /dt = 0 line is downward sloping. Above this line, Southern catch-up γ is strong enough
that dwN /dt is positive. This line slopes downward because Northern skilled biased technical
change is an independent source of rising Northern inequality. Thus, even if there were no
Southern catch-up (γ = 0), the North would experience rising inequality whenever ρN > 0.
Figure 3 can be completely generalized. To allow for ρS 6= 0, simply appeal to equation
(10) and part (2) of lemma 2 to establish that if ρS is positive then the dwN /dt = 0 and
dz/dt = 0 curves shift up by the same amount and the dwS /dt = 0 curve shifts down.
To draw a figure in (γ, ρS )-space, note that the symmetry of parts (1) and (2) of lemma 2
establish that such a figure can be derived from figure 3 by interchanging all the references
to North and South.
This discussion is formalized in the next theorem which is the generalization of theorem
1 to the case of skill biased technical change.
Theorem 3. Under assumption 1 there exist linear functions fz (ρN , ρS ) and fw (ρN , ρS )
such that
17

(1) γ > fz (ρN , ρS ) ⇔ dz/dt > 0. fz is the rate of Southern catch-up that is necessary
and sufficient for the least skill-intensive Northern goods to migrate South. Further,
fz = az ρN + bz ρS so that this rate fz depends positively on the rates of skill biased
technical change ρN and ρS .
(2) γ > fw (ρN , ρS ) ⇔ {dwN /dt > 0 and dwS /dt > 0}. fw is the rate of Southern catchup that is necessary and sufficient for inequality to rise in both regions. Further,
fw = max(awN ρN + bwN ρS , awS ρN + bwS ρS ).
Theorems 2-3, lemma 2, and the expressions for the ax , bx , and cx in the proof of lemma
2, completely characterize the relationship between Southern catch-up, international trade,
and inequality.

6. Some Notes on the Interpretation of γ
This section develops some details about the Southern catch-up parameter γ. The section
can be skipped without loss of continuity. Define γH ≡ ∂ ln HN (z, t)/∂t − ∂ ln HS (z, t)/∂t.10
Also, let θLi be unskilled labor’s cost share for good z̄, i = N, S. Then11

γ = γH − θLN ρN + θLS ρS .
10

(11)

By ∂ ln Hi (z̄, t)/∂t we mean the derivative of ln Hi (wHi , wLi , z, t) with respect to its fourth argument
(t) and evaluated at (wHi , wLi , z) = (wHi (t), wLi (t), z(t)).
∂
11
From the definition of cost shares, θLi ≡ wLi Li (z, t)/Ci (wHi , wLi , z, t). Since ∂t
ln Ci (wHi , wLi , z, t) =
∂
∂
∂
∂
θLi ∂t ln Li (z, t) + (1 − θLi ) ∂t ln Hi (z, t), assumption 1 implies that ∂t ln Ci (wHi , wLi , z, t) = ∂t
ln Hi (z, t) −
θLi ρi . Equation (11) follows from this expression together with equation (9) and the definition of γH .

18

Equation (11) reveals three things about γ. First, in the absence of skill biased technical
change (ρN = ρS = 0), γ = γH so that our definition of Southern catch-up reduces to γH > 0.
This is useful in that γH is a more primitive parameterization of technical change than is γ.
Unfortunately, γH is not a particularly informative parameter in the presence of skill biased
technical change. Second, since γ depends on the ρi whereas γH does not, a mathematically
expedient parameterization of our problem is in terms of the triplet (γH , ρN , ρS ). However,
there is a trivial and invertible linear mapping between (γH , ρN , ρS ) and (γ, ρN , ρS ) so that
we are free to forego the mathematically expedient parameterization (γH , ρN , ρS ) in favor
of the economically meaningful parameterization (γ, ρN , ρS ).
Third, γ depends on cost shares θLi . This reflects the usual problem that with nonneutral technical change, productivity indexes depend on the choice of inputs used in the
base period e.g., Hulten (1973).

To see this visually, consider figure 4 which portrays

the special case where skill biased technical change rotates this isoquant inwards around the
point (L0 , H 0 ). The distance between the two isoquants along a ray from the origin is related
to several commonly used productivity measures. This distance shrinks as L grows. By
implication, the measure of productivity depends on unskilled labor’s cost share. Extending
this logic to comparisons between goods with different unskilled labor shares explains the
dependence of Southern catch-up on factor cost shares.
This factor share complication creates a question of how to define Southern catch-up for
all goods z and not just for z. This is conceptually easy to do, but involves considerable
additional notation without offering any deep additional insights.12 The interested reader
∂
Conceptually, Southern catch-up is simple to define for all z. Assume that ∂t
ln HN (z, t)/HS (z, t) is
independent of z. Then Southern catch-up may be defined as the set of triplets (γH , ρN , ρS ) for which
12

19

is invited to work out these insights by referring to equations (26)-(27) in appendix A.4. We
therefore forego generality in favor of expositional simplicity.

7. Relation to Feenstra and Hanson
Since we are building on work by Feenstra and Hanson (1996a), it is worthwhile understanding the differences between our work and theirs. In terms of the questions asked, we
are both interested in theorem 1. However, we are also interested in our figure 1 empirical
observation and its theorem 2 explanation. In terms of the model used, there are a number
of important differences. First, our model combines endowments-based comparative advantage with Ricardian-based comparative advantage. The latter is central to our discussion
of technological catch-up.

In contrast, Feenstra and Hanson (1996a) do not consider a

general form of technological catch-up and in particular do not consider a form that allows
for Ricardian-based comparative advantage. (See equation 12 below.) Second, Feenstra and
Hanson consider a partial equilibrium model rather than a general equilibrium model. This
is natural given their partial equilibrium question, namely, what is the impact of foreign
direct investment on skill-upgrading within a single industry? In contrast, we are interested
in a general equilibrium question and hence a general equilibrium model of international
trade. Such models are closed with a trade-balance condition. As was shown, much of the
adjustment in our model takes place via this trade-balance condition.
Third, Feenstra and Hanson assume that skilled and unskilled labor are Leontief or
γH − θLN (z, t)ρN + θLS (z, t)ρS > 0 for all z where θLi (z, t) is unskilled labor’s share of costs for good
z. However, this set is a little messy to write down neatly. Since it involves expressions of the form
maxz θLi (z, t) and minz θLi (z, t), this messiness also makes it difficult to neatly communicate the information
in lemma 2.

20

perfect complements. This makes sense given their question. They are interested in foreign
direct investment and so must model capital. To keep things simple in their 3-factor model,
they assume that the 2 types of labor are perfect complements. Using obvious notation,
their production functions are given by

Fi (H, L, K; z) = Ai min



H
L
,
aH (z) aL (z)

1−θ

K θ,

i = N, S.

(12)

Clearly, for the purposes of fully explaining rising inequality, flexibly modelling the elasticity
of substitution between skilled and unskilled labor is crucial (e.g., Katz and Murphy 1992).
Finally, there are many other differences between their model and ours that are of a more
technical nature. (i) Uniqueness of equilibrium plays an important role for any comparative
static exercise. As Feenstra and Hanson are careful to note, they obtain uniqueness by
assuming that capital’s cost share θ is the same for all z. This is a strong assumption.
In contrast, our uniqueness falls directly out of the strict quasi-concavity of production
and utility functions. Further, they use uniqueness to establish a stability condition that
is then used to establish results about relative wages. This puts even more weight on
their assumption about capital’s cost share. In contrast, we need none of this. (ii) Their
international differences in the level of technology (the Ai ) are Hicks-neutral. We make no
assumptions about the level of international technology differences. (iii) In their production
function the Ai are independent of z. This is the point made at the start of this section
that Feenstra and Hanson’s international technology differences are a source of Ricardian
absolute advantage, but not a source of Ricardian comparative advantage.

21

8. Outstanding Questions
Southern catch-up has welfare implications that have been hotly contested. For one, the
South’s terms of trade are expected to deteriorate as faster productivity growth in the export
sector reduces export prices relative to import prices. The usual Bhagwati (1958) analysis
of immiserizing growth suggests that this may reduce Southern welfare.

Another hotly

debated question in Northern countries is whether the North has been made worse off as
a result of production migrating South. We revisit these issues within the context of our
model.
Since we are interested in the case where Southern catch-up and skill biased technical
change lead to rising z and rising inequality in both regions, we assume that γ, ρN and ρS
are non-negative. This implies that in theorem 3, fz̄ ≥ fw . Thus, γ > fz̄ (ρN , ρS ) is necessary
and sufficient for rising trade and inequality.
Assumption 2. (1) γ, ρN , and ρS are non-negative. (2) γ > fz̄ (ρN , ρS ).

Equivalently,

dwN /dt > 0, dwS /dt > 0, and dz/dt > 0. (3) ∂ ln Hi (z, t)/dt is non-positive and independent of z, i = N, S.
To discuss real income we will need a price index P . Part (3) of assumption 2 places
restrictions on the variability of individual components of P . With Cobb-Douglas preferences, the natural choice of P is the Cobb-Douglas price index.13 Then Yi /P (i = N, S) is
both real income and a measure of welfare for a representative consumer with income Yi .
The next theorem answers the questions raised at the start of this section.
13

This is implicitly defined by ln P ≡

Rz
0

α(z) ln PS (z)dz +

22

R1
z

α(z) ln PN (z)dz.

Theorem 4. Let assumptions 1-2 hold. Then
(1) d(YN /P )/dt > 0 and d(YS /P )/dt > 0. That is, real income rises in both the North
and the South.
(2) d[PN (z 0 )/PS (z)]/dt > 0 for all pairs z and z 0 with z < z < z 0 . That is, the South’s
terms of trade deteriorate and the North’s terms of trade improve.
(3) d(YS /YN )/dt > 0. That is, Southern catch-up reduces the North-South income gap.
Theorem 4 states that even though catch-up leads to a deterioration of the South’s terms of
trade, the South’s real income rises. In Baghwati’s terminology, growth is not immiserizing
even though it leads to a deterioration of the terms of trade. Theorem 4 also states that the
North’s real income rises. That is, the income lost by having production migrate South is
offset by an improvement in the terms of trade. Thus, theorem 4 at least partly buttresses
claims that Southern catch-up is no threat to the North.
Next, we establish a result about the real value of exports. The value of Southern exports
is XS ≡ YN

R z̄
0

α(z)dz and the real value of Southern exports is XS /P.

Theorem 5. Let assumptions 1-2 hold. Then
(1) d(XS /P )/dt > 0. That is, Southern catch-up raises the real value of Southern exports.
(2) d(XS /P )/dt is increasing in γ. That is, the faster is Southern catch-up, the greater is
the growth in real Southern exports.

23

Theorem 5 establishes that in theorem 2, dz̄/dt can be replaced by d(XS /P )/dt. That is,
differences in catch-up across Southern countries can explain the figure 1 correlation between
rising inequality and real export growth.
Next, we establish a result about the real value of exports. The value of Southern exports
is XS ≡ YN

R z̄
0

α(z)dz and the real value of Southern exports is XS /P.

Theorem 6. Let assumptions 1-2 hold. Then
(1) d(XS /P )/dt > 0. That is, Southern catch-up raises the real value of Southern exports.
(2) d(XS /P )/dt is increasing in γ. That is, the faster is Southern catch-up, the greater is
the growth in real Southern exports.
Theorem 5 establishes that in theorem 2, dz̄/dt can be replaced by d(XS /P )/dt. That is,
differences in catch-up across Southern countries can explain the figure 1 correlation between
rising inequality and real export growth.
Finally, we collect a number of additional results about earnings. Recall that hi (z, t) ≡
Hi (z, t)/Li (z, t) and that its dependence on relative wages wi is suppressed. Let εi (z, t) ≡
−∂ ln hi (z, t)/∂wi ≥ 0 be the elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled Southern
labor.
Theorem 7. Let assumptions 1-2 hold.
(1) d(wHi /P )/dt > 0, i = N, S. That is, real earnings for skilled workers rise in both the
North and the South.

24

(2) Assume ρN = ρS = 0. There exist κS (t) ∈ (0, 1) and κN (t) > 0 for which the following
holds: εi (·; t) > κi (t) ⇒ d(wLi /P )/dt > 0, i = N, S. That is, if elasticities of substitution are sufficiently large then real earnings for unskilled labor rise in both the North
and the South.
Part (1) is an immediate consequence of Southern productivity catch-up. Part (2) is a
consequence of rising real income Yi /P, rising inequality wHi /wLi , and the fact that Yi is
a weighted average of wHi and wLi .

Part (3) is non-trivial.

a weighted average of wHi /P and wLi /P is rising.

Rising Yi /P means that

With sufficiently large substitution

possibilities, the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers cannot widen too much.
So even wLi /P must rise. This completes our discussion of welfare results.

9. Empirics
Our interest lies in explaining the complex evolution of Southern inequality in terms of
Southern catch-up, skill-upgrading, and trade. There is one immediate problem in taking
our theory to the data. The theoretical analysis takes goods z as the unit of analysis.
Unfortunately, internationally comparable data are only reported at the industry level. In
order to bridge this gap between theory and data, in this section we augment our theoretical
model by adding an industry dimension.
We know that each industry is a collection of heterogenous goods. For example, the
automobile industry includes both unskilled-intensive (low-z) car seats and skill-intensive
(high-z) engine blocks. It is therefore natural to think of each industry as assembling a
wide range of intermediate inputs z into a final good. To introduce industries, let µj be a
25

measure on the unit interval that picks off the intermediate inputs used by industry j. Let
p(z) be the price of z faced by producers i.e., p(z) = PS (z) for z < z and p(z) = PN (z) for
z > z. Let xj (p, z) be the amount of z demanded by industry j. To define preferences over
the Xj rather than the intermediates z, re-write our Cobb-Douglas utility function as U ≡
P

j

βj ln Xj . Assuming that industry output is produced using Cobb-Douglas technologies,

ln Xj =

R1
0

αj (z) ln xj (p, z)µj (dz), U becomes U =

this can be rewritten as U =

R1
0

P R1
j

0

βj αj (z) ln xj (p, z)µj (dz). Since

α(z) ln x(z)dz, the new industry layer is consistent with the

utility function used in this paper.
The only problem with introducing an industry layer, then, is that assembly potentially
has implications for resource allocation. To sidestep this we assume that assembly is costless. Costless assembly introduces an indeterminacy in the location of assembly and hence
in trade patterns. We break this indeterminacy by assuming that there is an arbitrarily
small trade cost for the Xj so that they are assembled and consumed in the same location.
Thus, assembly will have no implications for resource allocation or trade. In short, we can
seamlessly add an industry layer to the analysis.

9.1. Skill Upgrading
Since many of the results of this paper apply at the economy-wide level, this leaves us
with only a handful of observations e.g., the 29 observations corresponding to the Southern
countries of figure 1. However, our core theoretical result is a form of skill upgrading at the
industry level. Specifically, let z̄j be the competitive margin for industry j i.e., all industry
j intermediates z < z̄j are produced in the South. Then Southern catch-up in industry j

26

will raise z̄j . We can thus examine skill upgrading with the much greater sample variation
obtained by pooling across countries and industries.
We measure skill upgrading as the payroll share of skilled workers. Let hSj (wS , p, z̄j )
be the ratio of skilled to unskilled workers in industry j.14 Then the payroll share of skilled
workers may be written as
P Sj ≡

wS hSj (wS , p, z̄j )
.
1 + wS hSj (wS , p, z̄j )

(13)

Holding wS constant, the direct effect of Southern catch-up is to raise z j . This raises hSj
which in turn leads to skill upgrading.15 The indirect effects of Southern catch-up operate
via the rise in wS . From equation (13), there are three such effects, but these are either of
a second-order of magnitude or subsumable into a regression fixed effect.16 We thus expect
that the net effect of Southern catch-up in industry j will be skill upgrading in industry j.

9.2. The Estimating Equation
Let i denote countries and in equation (13) replace S subscripts with i subscripts. Also,
with many countries, z̄j requires an i subscript. Let t index years. Our starting point is
the translog-motivated skill-upgrading regression that is the starting point of Berman et al.
14

Mathematically, hSj is defined as
R z̄j

hSj (wS , p, z j ) ≡ R0z̄j
0

HS (wS , z) xj (p, z) µj (dz)
LS (wS , z) xj (p, z) µj (dz)

where we have re-introduced wS as an argument in unit demand functions HS and LS .
15
That hSj is increasing in z j can be seen by calculating ∂hSj /∂z j and noting that
HS (wS , z j )/LS (wS , z j ) > hSj (wS , p, z j ).
16
(1) The rise in wS , holding hSj constant, raises P Sj . (2) The rise in wS leads to a substitution of skilled
for unskilled labor within goods. It is easy to show that this lowers hSj and hence lowers P Sj . (3) The
rise in wS raises the relative price of skill-intensive intermediate inputs, thus leading to a within-industry
substitutution towards less skill-intensive intermediate inputs. This lowers hSj and hence lowers P Sj . For
a complete description of these effects, see the discussions following theorem 1.

(1994), Autor et al. (1998), Feenstra and Hanson (1996a, 1997, 1999), and others:

∆P Sijt = β∆ ln(Kijt /Vijt ) + δi + εijt

where Kijt /Vijt is the ratio of capital to value added in industry j in country i and where the
∆ operator converts variables into average annual changes over the period. In most studies
i is taken to be the United States so that no country fixed effect is needed. In our case, we
will pool across countries and introduce the country fixed effect δi .
Our main focus is on the effect of ∆z̄ijt on ∆P Sijt . To this end, we proxy ∆z̄ijt by a
measure of Southern catch-up Cijt that is a multi-country generalization of our equation (9)
definition of Southern catch-up:

Cijt ≡ ∆πijt − ΣnN ωinj ∆πnjt .

(14)

Here, πijt is the log of labor productivity, n indexes the Northern trading partners of Southern country i. The Northern trading partners are taken to be the United States along with
Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, and Sweden.
In equation (14), ωinj is n’s share of country i’s trade. By trade we mean the sum of bilateral
imports and exports. To isolate productivity effects from share shifts, ωinj is taken to be
the average trade share over the period. We will show below that results are not sensitive
to the definition of ωinj .
In our baseline analysis we divide the sample into 2 periods, 1978-82 and 1984-90 and
add a dummy for the 1984-90 period. This helps us avoid the debt crisis. We also consider
28

growth in the endowment ratio HS /LS . This captures the fact that human capital formation
is a key component of the process of catch-up. Although we have excluded human capital
formation from this paper, we have fully worked out the model with it included. We review
the specifics below.
To summarize, we run the regression

∆P Sijt = β1 Cijt + β2 ∆ ln(Kijt /Vijt ) + β3 ∆ ln(Hit /Lit ) + δi + δj + δt + νijt

(15)

where Hit /Lit is the endowment ratio for country i in year t. We run weighted regressions
using payroll shares as weights. More precisely, the weights are payij /
is the payroll of industry j in country i.

9.3. Data
Data for ∆P Sijt are available from the United Nations General Industrial Statistics (GIS).
The GIS reports payroll data for operative and non-operative workers.17 This distinction
basically follows the U.S. distinction between production and non-production workers so
that we treat operatives as unskilled workers and non-operatives as skilled workers. We
calculate P Sijt as the payroll of non-operatives divided by total payroll. We have data on
P Sijt for all 28 International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC Revision 2) industries
for 18 developing and newly industrialized countries over the years 1978-90. We include only
those countries with GDP per capita less than 60% of U.S. GDP per capita in 1978. Our
results are not sensitive to the choice of cut-off. Ranked by GDP per capita in 1978, the 18

countries are Venezuela, Spain, Ireland, Greece, Mexico, Portugal, Uruguay, Malta, Chile,
South Korea, Turkey, Peru, Columbia, Guatemala, Philippines, Egypt, India, and Ethiopia.
All data used in the definition of Cijt are from Antweiler and Trefler (2000). Industryspecific capital stocks Kijt were constructed using a 15-year double declining balance method
(e.g., Leamer 1984, pages 230-34) and the UNIDO gross fixed capital formation series. The
initial year used was 1963. The data were deflated using purchasing power parity-adjusted
investment deflators (Summers and Heston 1992). National endowments of skilled and
unskilled labor for Hit /Lit are from the Barro and Lee (1993) database as updated by
Antweiler and Trefler (2000). Hit is the working age population with at least 12 years of
education and Lit is the remaining working age population.

9.4. Results
Estimates of equation (15) for our benchmark case are reported in column 1 of table 1. The
coefficient on Southern catch-up Cijt is 0.081 with a t-statistic of 3.75. This supports our
contention that Southern catch-up leads to skill upgrading. By implication, Southern catchup at least partly explains the complex evolution of Southern inequality. Since Southern
catch-up clearly explains export growth, Southern catch-up also potentially explains the
trade-inequality correlation of figure 1.
From table 1, the impact of a rising supply of skills on skill-upgrading is positive. Obviously, this is inconsistent with a movement down a demand schedule. It is consistent with
the aggregate time series co-movements of factor prices and supplies in some countries (e.g.,
the United States), but not in others, e.g., Canada (Murphy et al. 1998) and South Korea

30

(Kim and Topel 1995).
What does our model predict about this coefficient? Letting gS be the growth rate of
the endowment ratio HS /LS , we can prove that

d2 z

> 0 and
> 0.
d(HS /LS )

(16)

From equation (16), a rise in HS /LS leads via z to skill upgrading i.e., the coefficient on the
national skill level variable is predicted to be positive. This is what we find empirically.
More conventionally, we find that capital deepening contributes to skill upgrading.
Lastly, the 1984-90 time dummy is positive and large. Its value of 0.013 is comparable
to the 0.010 sample mean of the dependent variable (skill upgrading ∆P Sijt ). This is suggestive of accelerated technical change in the 1980s and is thus consistent with U.S. research
e.g., Katz and Murphy (1992).
We have examined the sensitivity of our results to a number of alternative specifications.
Column 2 of table 1 reports a specification that omits the industry fixed effects. Column
3 reports a specification that omits the growth in the supply of skilled workers. These
alternative specifications do not change the key result that Southern catch-up is positively
correlated with skill ugprading. There is also no change when we shrink the sample by
omitting from it the OECD members (i.e., Spain, Ireland, Portugal, and Greece). Likewise,
there is no change when we omit all observations with standardized residuals in excess of
2.5.
The most important source of coefficient fragility turns out to be the choice of sample

31

period. This appears in table 1 where we report results for different choices of the first
period.

In the table we consider the period 1978-82 (to avoid the debt crisis), 1978-83,

and 1978-84. It is clear that there is some fragility, especially for the period 1978-84.
Notice that the Cijt and ∆ ln(Hit /Lit ) coefficients for 1978-84 move in opposite directions
so that we very precisely estimate their sum. This is interesting because, from equation
(16), d2 z̄/dtdgS > 0 so that the faster is the growth of HS /LS , the greater is the impact of
catch-up on skill ugprading. Thus the theory suggests that there may be some problem in
separately estimating the two effects.
We divided up the sample into two periods in order to meaningfully increase the sample
size. It is of some interest then that when we consider only a single period (1978-90), the
coefficient does not significantly change in size, but its statistical significance falls with the
fall in sample size. This is what one expects if dividing the sample into two periods and
pooling is legitimate.
A key feature of the theoretical model is the interplay between Southern catch-up and
trade. Since trade is central to our thinking, it is of interest to experiment with the trade
weights ωinj of equation (14). To this end, let Minjt (Xinjt ) be the value of country i’s
imports from (exports to) country n for industry j in year t. Let Tinjt ≡ Minjt + Xinjt
be the volume of trade between i and n. The trade weights used in table 1 are ωinj =
Σ1990
t=1978 (Tinjt /

P

n0

Tin0 jt ) /12. In table 2, we consider alternative weights. In columns 1-2,

Tinjt is replaced by Minjt and Xinjt , respectively. Thus, the estimates are not sensitive to
whether imports or exports are used. In column 3, we move away from industry-specific
weights to national weights by replacing Tinjt with its sum across industries, Σj Tinjt . Again,

32

the coefficient on Southern catch-up is little changed from that reported in the first column
of table 1.
In short, this rudimentary empirical exercise has presented evidence that Southern catchup (as measured by relative labor productivity growth) has a significantly positive impact
on skill upgrading in 18 low- and middle–income countries. By implication, differences
in catch-up among Southern countries at least partly explains the complex evolution of
Southern inequality. Since catch-up obviously explains export growth, catch-up presents
a possible explanation for the striking figure 1 relationship between rising inequality and
export growth.

10. Conclusion
Among developing and newly industrialized countries, the Deininger and Squire (1996)
database shows that rising inequality during the 1980s was a common occurrence. This is
sharply at odds with the Stolper-Samuelson theorem which predicts that Southern inequality
should have fallen. In trying to explain this complex evolution of Southern inequality, we
pointed out that there is a positive correlation across Southern countries between export
growth and inequality growth. This suggested to us that Southern inequality trends are
linked via general equilibrium trade movements triggered by technological catch-up.
To model this, we married the Ricardian international technology differences model
(Dornbusch et al. 1977) with the Heckscher-Ohlin model (Dornbusch et al. 1980). In our
model, technological catch-up causes production of the least skill-intensive Northern goods
to migrate South. By Southern standards, these new goods are skill intensive. Thus the
33

demand for skills rises in both regions. That is, inequality rises in both the North and the
South (as in Feenstra and Hanson 1996a). As importantly, Southern catch-up induces the
correlation between export growth and inequality growth that we demonstrated empirically
in figure 1. Further, a rudimentary empirical exercise revealed that, as predicted, Southern
skill upgrading is correlated with the trade-weighted average of Southern catch-up. In short,
this paper provides some initial insights into the complex evolution of Southern inequality
and its relationship to changing trade patterns.

A. Appendix
A.1. Proof of Lemma 1
Let LN (z) and HN (z) be the amount of unskilled and skilled labor, respectively, needed
to produce one unit of good z in the North. Define hN (z) ≡ HN (z)/LN (z). To keep
the notation clear, the relative wage wN has been suppressed. Since CN (wHN , wLN , z)
is homogenous of degree one in wHN and wLN , CN (wHN , wLN , z) = wLN · CN (wN , 1, z).
Differentiating this with respect to wLN yields ∂CN (wHN , wLN , z)/∂wLN = CN (wN , 1, z) −
wN ∂CN (wN , 1, z)/∂wN . By Shepard’s Lemma, we have LN (z) = ∂CN (wHi , wLi , z)/∂wLN .
Combining the above two equations yields ∂CN (wN , 1, z)/∂wN = HN (z). Thus we have

Hence, if wN < wS , then ∂ ln CN (wHN , wLN , z)/∂z < ∂ ln CN (wHS , wLS , z)/∂z. From inequality (1) we have ∂ ln CN (wHS , wLS , z)/∂z ≤ ∂ ln CS (wHS , wLS , z)/∂z. Combining these
two inequality yields ∂ ln CN (wHN , wLN , z)/∂z < ∂ ln CS (wHS , wLS , z)/∂z. This implies that
inequality (2) holds.
This completes the proof of lemma 1. Note that given factor prices, z̄ must be unique
because CN (wHN , wLN , z) and CS (wHS , wLS , z) intersect only once.
A.2. Existence and Uniqueness of an Equilibrium
Lemma 3. For hN /hS sufficiently large, wN must be larger than wS in any equilibrium.
Proof. Plugging equation (4) into the labor market clearing condition for Southern skilled
labor in equation (5) and using the zero profit condition yield
HS = (YN + YS )

Let θHi (z) ≡ wHS HS (z)/ [wHS HS (z) + wLS LS (z)] be the cost share of skilled workers in reRz
gion i (= S, N ). Multiplying equation (17) by wHS , we have wHS HS = (YN +YS ) 0 α(z)θHS (z)dz.
Similarly, from
R z the Southern unskilled labor market clearing condition we have wLS LS =
(YN + YS ) 0 α(z) [1 − θHS (z)] dz. Taking a ratio of the two yields

α(z)θHS (z)dz

wS =
Rz 0
hS

Using the fact that θHS (z) is increasing in z, equation (18) implies wS > κS /hS , where κS ≡
θHS (0)/ [1 − θHS (0)] . Likewise, from the Northern labor market clearing conditions we have
38

wN < κN /hN , where κN ≡ [1 − θHN (1)] /θHN (1). Therefore, wS /wN > (κS /κN ) (hN /hS ).
By the regularity of production functions and the fact that endowments are strictly
positive and finite so that factor prices are strictly positive and finite, θHS (0) and θHN (1)
are bounded strictly away from 0 and 1. Thus, κS /κN is positive and bounded. It follows
that for large enough hN /hS , wS /wN > 1.
Lemma 4. For hN /hS sufficiently large, there exists a unique equilibrium. Further, in the
unique equilibrium wN < wS .
Proof. Equilibrium is defined as a set of prices {Pi (·), wLi , wHi }i=N,S that clear product and
factor markets. The following proof of the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium modifies
the Dornbusch et al. (1980) proof to allow for international technology differences. In our
proof we suppress t as an argument of all functions.
Let Fi (Hi0 (z), L0i (z))be the production function for good z in region i (= N, S), where
Hi0 (z) and L0i (z) are the total amounts of skilled and unskilled labor, respectively, required
to produce good z (as opposed to per unit demands Hi (z) and Li (z)). The social planner’s
problem is to choose {HN0 (z), L0N (z), HS0 (z), L0S (z)} for each z to maximize

Since the objective function is strictly quasi-concave and the constraint functions are convex,
by theorem M.K.4 in Mas-Collel et al. (1995, pp.962), a solution to the above Kuhn-Tucker
conditions exists and is unique. We next show that the competitive equilibrium solution
satisfies the above Kuhn-Tucker conditions.
By lemma 1, when wN < wS , the South specializes in goods z ∈ [0, z] and the North
specializes in goods z ∈ [z, 1] where z satisfies PN (z̄) = PS (z̄). Equations (21)−(22) are
39

trivially satisfied. For z > z̄, HS0 (z) = LS0 (z) = 0 and equations (19)−(20) hold. So
consider equations (19)−(20) for z < z̄. Start with equation (20). In our competitive
equilibrium, ∂FS (z)/∂L0S (z) = wLS /PS (z), FN (z) + FS (z) = FS (z) and (by equation 4)
FS (z) = α(z)(YN + YS )/PS (z) so that the left hand side of equation (20) is

We are allowed one normalization. We choose wLS /(YN + YS ) = µLS . Then equation (23)
implies equation (20).
To show that our competitive equilibrium solution satisfies equation (19), derive the

Hence equation (19) is satisfied if wHS /(YN +YS ) = µHS . (We cannot use another normaliza∂FS (z) ∂FS (z)

For the Northern version of equations (19)−(22), the only additional step comes from
not being able to normalize (i.e., wLS /(YN + YS ) = µLS .) To get around this, establish
equation (23) with z = z̄ and S = N to obtain wLN /(YN + YS ) = µLN .

A.3. Downward Sloping Aggregate Relative Demands
Lemma 5. Given z, ∂N (z)/∂wN < 0 and ∂S(z)/∂wS < 0. That is, the aggregate demand
for skilled labor relative to unskilled labor is downward sloping.
Proof. We only consider the Southern labor market. Let εS (z) ≡ −∂ ln hS (z, t)/∂wS > 0
be the elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled workers for Southern good
z. Let θHS (z) and θLS (z) be the cost shares of skilled and unskilled workers, respectively.
Define YHS ≡ wHS HS /YS , and YLS ≡ wLS LS /YS . Then given z̄,

By inspection, if ∂S(z̄)/∂wS < 0 for εS (·) = 0, then ∂S(z̄)/∂wS < 0 for all εS (·) ≥ 0.
We therefore only consider the case where εS (·) = 0. Then

c11 is positive because the North has a comparative advantage in more skill-intensive
goods (lemma 1.) By lemma 5, c22 ≡ ∂S(z̄)/∂wS and c33 ≡ ∂N (z̄)/∂wN are negative. The
signs of other elements in [cjk ] follow from the convention that a higher z good uses relatively
more skilled labor. Finally, the signs of the cjk imply that the determinant |cjk | is strictly
positive.
Using the fact that |cjk | > 0, one can invert equation (25) to yield equation (10) with

Proof of theorem 1
With neutral technical change, b2 = b3 = 0. Equations (28)−(30) thus imply that dz/dt,

Proof of theorem 2

The first term in d ln Pi (z, t)/dt reflects the impact of technical change on product prices
for given wages. The second term reflects the impact of change in wages on product prices
for given technology levels. Denote πi (z, t) ≡ −∂ ln Pi (z, t)/∂t = −∂ ln Ci (wHi , wLi , z, t)/∂t
(i = N, S). Recall that in section 3, we assumed that the Ci (wHi , wLi , z, t) are non-increasing
in t, i.e., πi (z, t) ≥ 0. In the following, t will be dropped as an argument. Thus, the change
in the price index can be written as

The following will show that 0 α(z)πS (z)dz > d ln(YS /YN )/dt · 0 α(z)dz. Combining this
with the assumption that πN (·) is non-negative implies d ln(YN /P )/dt > 0.
Under part (3) of assumption 2, γH ≡ ∂ ln [HN (z, t)/HS (z, t)] /∂t is independent of z.
We can therefore re-write the πi (·) as πN (z) = ρN θLN (z) − ∂ ln HN (z, t)/∂t and πS (z) =
ρS θLS (z) + γH − ∂ ln HN (z, t)/∂t. These πi (·), the expression for d ln(YS /YN )/dt above, and

A.7. Gini Data and Export Data
The Gini data are from Deninger and Squire (1996) as updated in http://www.worldbank.org
/research/growth/ dddeisqu.htm [deisqu2.exe or deisqu2.zip]. The countries selected for figure 1 are those satisfying 3 criteria. (a) The country had at least 2 years of consistent
Gini data between 1978 and 1992 (except the Philippines which only has data between 1975
and 1985.) Where more than 2 years were available, preference was given to the start year
closest to 1980 and the end year closest to 1990. (b) The start and end years of Gini data
were separated by at least 3 years and preferably 10 years. (Only Cote d’Ivoire, Israel, and
Turkey were separated by less than 5 years.) (c) Preference was given to Gini data that
were based on household surveys of personal gross income in urban areas.
Export data are from Statistics Canada’s World Trade Database as cleaned up and
deflated by Antweiler and Trefler (2000). (Hereafter ‘WTDB.’) The period used for changes
in exports were chosen to match the period used for changes in Gini coefficients. There are
three data imputations. (a) Taiwan is not in the WTDB. Instead we used IMF export data
(denominated in U.S. dollars) deflated by the U.S. GDP deflator. Since this deflator is not
quite comparable to that used in the WTDB, we then multiplied the Taiwan data by the
ratio of WTDB to IMF growth rates for the East Asian countries in our sample. (b) Due
to Chinese exports via Hong Kong, the export data for China and Hong Kong reported in
the WTDB are misleading. Thus, we adjusted the Chinese and Hong Kong data using the
information provided in table 2 of Feenstra et al. (1997) (c) Robert Lipsey has pointed out
to us problems with the WTDB for Mexico. For Mexico we therefore used the OECD series
‘exports of goods and services (volume index, 1990=100).

Growth in Real Exports (Log Changes)

Notes : (a ) The figures plot the change in Gini coefficients against the change in the log of real exports
over the 1980s. (b ) Data are from Deninger and Squire (1996). Where possible, we report Ginis calculated
from surveys of urban wage earners. This corresponds to the the notion of inequality used in our model.
See the appendix for futher data details. (c ) The axes are identical for both panels so that the reader can
visually overlay the two and obtain a similar positive relationship for all 29 countries.
