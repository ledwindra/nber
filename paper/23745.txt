Leaning Against the Wind: The Role of Different Assumptions About the Costs

August 2017
JEL No. E52,E58,G01
ABSTRACT
“Leaning against the wind” (LAW), that is, tighter monetary policy for financial-stability
purposes, has costs in terms of a weaker economy with higher unemployment and lower inflation
and possible benefits from a lower probability or magnitude of a (financial) crisis. A first obvious
cost is a weaker economy if no crisis occurs. A second cost—less obvious, but higher—is a
weaker economy if a crisis occurs. Taking the second cost into account, Svensson (2017) shows
that for representative empirical benchmark estimates and reasonable assumptions the costs of
LAW exceed the benefits by a substantial margin. Previous literature has disregarded the second
cost, by assuming that the crisis loss level is independent of LAW. Some recent literature has
effectively disregarded the second cost, making it to be of second order by assuming that the cost
of a crisis (the crisis loss level less the non-crisis loss level) is independent of LAW. In these
cases where the second cost is disregarded, for representative estimates a small but economically
insignificant amount of LAW is optimal.

Introduction

“Leaning against the wind” (of asset prices and credit booms) (LAW for short) refers to a monetary
policy that is somewhat tighter (that is, with a somewhat higher policy interest rate) than what
is consistent with flexible inflation targeting without taking any effects on financial stability into
account. LAW has obvious costs in terms of a weaker economy with higher unemployment and
lower inflation. It has been justified by possible benefits in the form of a lower probability or smaller
magnitude of future (financial) crisis (BIS (2014, 2016), Olsen (2015), Sveriges Riksbank (2013)),
although, strikingly, without the support of a credible numerical cost-benefit analysis (Allen, Bean,
and Gregorio (2016)). Svensson (2017) (first version distributed as Svensson (2016a)) provides
a framework for such an analysis and benchmark numerical estimates of the costs and benefits of
LAW. The result is that the costs exceed the benefits by a substantial margin. Extensive robustness
tests indicate that this result is quite robust. For example, to overturn the result, the effects of
LAW on the probability or magnitude of a crisis need to be more than 5–40 standard errors larger
than typical empirical estimates in the literature.
The framework takes two costs of LAW into account, in addition to the possible benefits from
a lower probability and smaller magnitude of a crisis. The first cost is the obvious cost of a weaker
economy if no crisis occurs. But there is a second cost of LAW, less obvious but higher, which has
been overlooked by the previous literature. If a crisis occurs when the economy is weaker because
of LAW, for a given magnitude of a crisis the economy will be weaker also in the crisis. For a given
magnitude of a crisis, the crisis loss level and the cost of a crisis will be higher with LAW than
without.
The two costs can be understood with the help of a simple example in terms of unemployment
gaps: First, suppose that without LAW the non-crisis unemployment gap is zero. Suppose that a
crisis increases the unemployment gap by 5 percentage points (pp). Then the crisis unemployment
gap is 0 + 5 = 5 pp. With a quadratic loss function, the non-crisis loss is 02 = 0, and the crisis
loss is 52 = 25. The cost of a crisis, defined as the crisis loss less the non-crisis loss, is 25 − 0 = 25.
Next, suppose that with LAW the non-crisis unemployment gap is 0.5 pp instead of 0. Then
the crisis unemployment gap will be 0.5 + 5 = 5.5 pp instead of 5. Then the non-crisis loss will
be 0.52 = 0.25 instead of 0, and the crisis loss will be 5.52 = 30.25 instead of 25. The first cost
of LAW is the non-crisis loss increase due to LAW, 0.25 − 0 = 0.25. The second is the crisis loss
increase due to LAW, 30.25 − 25 = 5.25. The second cost is the main cost of LAW. Furthermore,

1

the cost of a crisis (the crisis loss less the non-crisis loss) is 30.25 − 0.25 = 30 instead of 25. The
cost of a crisis is higher with LAW than without. In this example, the first cost of LAW is of the
second order, whereas the second cost is of the first order. It follows that, for a zero non-crisis
unemployment gap, the marginal cost is zero for the first cost of LAW but positive for the second
cost. Overlooking the second cost misses that the marginal cost of LAW is positive, not zero.
The previous literature trying to quantify the costs and benefits of LAW (including Ajello,
Laubach, Lopez-Salido, and Nakata (2016), Diaz Kalan, Laséen, Vestin, and Zdzienicka (2015),
Svensson (2014, 2015), and IMF (2015)) has used an alternative assumption about the loss function.
It has assumed that the crisis loss level is constant and independent of LAW, thereby disregarding
the second cost of LAW, the main cost of LAW. In terms of the example above: Suppose again
that with LAW the non-crisis unemployment gap is 0.5 pp. In the framework above, the crisis
unemployment gap, the crisis loss, and the crisis loss increase are, respectively, 5.5 pp, 5.52 = 30.25,
and 30.25 − 25 = 5.25. In the previous literature, they are instead, respectively, 5 pp, 52 = 25, and
25 − 25 = 0, regardless of the non-crisis unemployment gap. The second cost of LAW, the crisis
loss increase, is thus zero instead of positive. Then, with the first cost being of second order, it
follows that, for a zero non-crisis unemployment gap, the marginal cost of LAW will be zero instead
of positive. With a positive marginal benefit of LAW, some LAW will then be optimal. However,
as we shall see, the optimal LAW is quite small, corresponding to a policy-rate increase of only a
few basis points (bp), and thus of no practical relevance, as shown by Ajello et al. (2016).
The alternative assumption of a constant crisis loss has the counter-intuitive implication that
the cost of a crisis (the crisis loss less the non-crisis loss) is decreasing in the non-crisis loss. In
particular, if the non-crisis unemployment gap for some reason would be above 5 pp, the economy
would be better off in a crisis, because then the unemployment gap would drop to 5 pp. It trivially
follows that the cost of a crisis is lower with LAW than without, because LAW would increase the
non-crisis loss without affecting the crisis loss.
More recently, Filardo and Rungcharoenkitkul (2016) and Gourio, Kashyap, and Sim (2017)
(FR and GKS for short) have responded to Svensson (2016a), arguing that LAW would be optimal
and maintaining that this contradicts my result. However, as suggested in the Svensson (2016b)
discussion of FR, their results may be explained by them using a second alternative assumption,
namely that the cost of a crisis is constant and independent of LAW. In terms of the simple example
above: FR and GKS can be interpreted as assuming that the unemployment gap is not affected
by a crisis and that there is a separate constant cost of a crisis (the crisis loss less the non-crisis
2

loss) that is always 25, regardless of the non-crisis unemployment gap. Then, without LAW, the
non-crisis loss is zero and the crisis loss is 25. With LAW, the non-crisis loss is 0.25, and the crisis
loss is 0.25 + 25 = 25.25. The first cost of LAW, the non-crisis loss increase, is 0.25 − 0 = 0.25. The
second cost, the crisis loss increase, is 25.25 − 25 = 0.25, equal to the first. Thus, the second cost
is not zero, as when a constant crisis loss is assumed, but it is as small as the first cost and thus of
second order.
Their assumption then has the same implications as the assumption of a constant crisis loss.
For a zero non-crisis unemployment gap, the marginal cost of LAW is zero, whereas the marginal
benefit is positive. Some LAW is then optimal. But again, as we shall see and as shown for a
constant crisis loss in Ajello et al. (2016), the optimal LAW is quit small and hardly economically
significant.
Outline

Section 2 summarizes the theoretical framework and section 3 summarizes the bench-

mark numbers used and the main result of Svensson (2017). Section 4 examines the two alternative
assumptions and their consequences. Section 5 concludes.

Theoretical framework

This section summarizes the theoretical framework used in Svensson (2017) (CB for short) to assess
the costs and benefits of LAW. Let ut denote the unemployment rate in quarter t ≥ 1, and let u∗t
denote the optimal unemployment rate under flexible inflation targeting when the possibility of a
financial crisis is disregarded. It is here called the benchmark unemployment rate. As explained in
CB (appendix A), it depends on exogenous cost-push shocks to the underlying Phillips curve.
Let the unemployment deviation, ũt , be defined as the deviation of the unemployment rate from
the benchmark unemployment rate, ũt ≡ ut − u∗t . Thus the unemployment deviation is not the
deviation from the steady state (or the unemployment gap as in the simple example in section 1)
but the deviation from the optimal policy under flexible inflation targeting when the probability
of a crisis is set to zero. As explained in CB (appendix A), the loss from the unemployment rate
deviating from the benchmark unemployment rate can be represented by the simple quadratic
(indirect) loss function,
Lt = (ũt )2 ,

3

t=1

where E1 denotes expectations conditional on information available in quarter 1, δ ∈ (0, 1) denotes
a discount factor, and E1 Lt denotes the expected quarter-t loss for t ≥ 1.

2.1

The benchmark case

In the benchmark case, the expected quarter-t loss is given by
E1 Lt = E1 (ũt )2 = (1 − pt )E1 (ũnt )2 + pt E1 (ũct )2 ≡ (1 − pt )E1 (ũnt )2 + pt E1 (ũnt + ∆ut )2

(2.3)

for t ≥ 1. Here it is assumed that, in quarter t ≥ 2, there can be either of two states of the world,
namely either a non-crisis or a (financial) crisis, denoted n and c, respectively. By assumption,
there is no crisis in quarter 1. Furthermore, pt denotes the probability of (having) a crisis in
quarter t, conditional on information available in quarter 1. The variable ũnt denotes the quarter-t
non-crisis unemployment deviation, that is, the unemployment deviation if there is no crisis in the
quarter. Then the first term of the right side of (2.3) is the probability of no crisis, 1 − pt , times the
expected non-crisis loss, E1 Lnt = E1 (ũnt )2 , that is, the expected loss if there is no crisis in quarter t.
The second term on the right side of (2.3) is the probability of a crisis times the expected crisis
loss, E1 Lct = E1 (ũct ), that is, the expected loss if there is a crisis in quarter t. A crisis is assumed to
be associated with a (possibly random) crisis increase in the unemployment rate, ∆ut > 0. Then
the crisis unemployment deviation, ũct , satisfies
ũct ≡ ũnt + ∆ut ,

(2.4)

Lct = (ũct )2 ≡ (ũnt + ∆ut )2 .

(2.5)

and the crisis loss is

This crisis increase in the unemployment rate is net of any policy response during a crisis. Thus,
∆ut can be interpreted as the unemployment-rate increase that is equivalent to the combination
of a demand shock and any shock to the transmission mechanism of monetary policy associated
with a crisis, net of the conventional and unconventional policy response at a crisis, including any

restriction on the policy response such as the lower bound of the policy rate. It represents the
magnitude of a crisis.2
Equation (2.3) can be written as 3
E1 Lt = E1 (ũnt )2 + pt [E1 (ũnt + ∆ut )2 − E1 (ũnt )2 ] = E1 (ũnt )2 + pt [E1 (∆ut )2 + 2E1 ũnt E1 ∆ut ]. (2.6)
Here, the expression in square brackets in (2.6) is the (expected) cost of a crisis, that is, the
(expected) crisis loss less the (expected) noncrisis loss, E1 (Lct − Lnt ). We see in the square brackets
on the right side of (2.6) that the (expected) cost of a crisis is increasing in the (expected) non-crisis
unemployment deviation, E1 ũnt . (When no confusion need arise, for brevity “expected” will often
be left out but be understood in the rest of the paper.)
Thus, a zero non-crisis unemployment deviation corresponds to the optimal policy under flexible
inflation targeting when the probability of a crisis is set to zero. This can be seen as a policy of no
leaning (NL for short). A positive non-crisis unemployment deviation corresponds to tighter policy
than NL and can thus be seen as representing LAW. A negative non-crisis unemployment deviation
corresponds to easier policy than NL and can be seen as representing leaning with the wind (LWW
for short).
Consider the effect on the intertemporal loss (2.2) of a policy tightening in the form of an
increase in the policy rate during quarters 1–4, denoted dī1 > 0. The cumulative net marginal cost
of LAW, NMC, is defined as the derivative of the intertemporal loss with respect to the policy rate

Furthermore, define the quarter-t net marginal cost, NMCt , as dE1 Lt /dī1 , the policy-rate effect
on the quarter-t expected loss. Taking the derivative of the right side of (2.6) with respect to ī1
The benchmark assumption is for simplicity that the benchmark unemployment rate, u∗t , is independent of
whether there is a crisis or not, in which case ∆ut is the crisis increase in the unemployment rate. As explained
in CB (appendix B), if the benchmark unemployment rate is correlated with a crisis, the crisis increase in the
unemployment rate and in the unemployment deviation are not the same. Then ∆ut is the crisis increase in the
unemployment deviation and equals the crisis increase in the unemployment rate less the crisis increase in the
benchmark unemployment rate. Because the benchmark unemployment rate is increasing in cost-push shocks to the
Phillips curve and such cost-push shocks are likely to be negative in a crisis, any crisis increase in the benchmark
unemployment rate is likely to be negative.

Here MCt denotes the (quarter-t) marginal cost of LAW. It consists of the marginal increase in
the expected quarter-t loss from an increase in the unemployment deviation at constant probability
and magnitude of a crisis.4 Furthermore, MBpt denotes the marginal benefit of LAW from a lower
probability of a crisis. It consists of the marginal reduction of the expected quarter-t loss from a
lower probability of a crisis at a constant non-crisis unemployment deviation and a constant magnidenotes the marginal benefit of LAW from a smaller magnitude of
tude of a crisis. Similarly, MB∆u

It is assumed that E1 (ũt dunt /dī1 ) = E1 ũt dE1 unt /dī1 , that is, that ũt and dunt /dī1 are independent conditional
on information available in quarter 1. Furthermore, because u∗t depends on cost-push shocks and is exogenous,
dE1 ũnt /dī1 = dE1 (unt − u∗t )/dī1 = dE1 unt /dī1 .
5
In practice, CB looks at the undiscounted cumulative net marginal cost (δ = 1). Because the marginal benefits
occur further into the future than the marginal cost, this tilts the case somewhat in favor of LAW.

Benchmark numbers and the main result

In order to asses whether or not the costs of LAW exceed the benefits, one needs numerical estimates
of or assumptions about the components of the marginal cost and benefits in (2.11)-(2.13).
The marginal cost of LAW

For a numerical estimate of the marginal cost of LAW, by (2.11)

one needs representative estimates of or realistic assumptions about the probability of a crisis, the
(expected) magnitude of a crisis, and the policy-rate effect on the (expected) non-crisis unemployment rate.
As a representative benchmark policy-rate effect on the (expected) non-crisis unemployment rate,
dE1 unt /dī1 , CB uses the impulse response of the Riksbank’s empirical DSGE model Ramses to a
1 pp higher policy rate during quarters 1–4, shown as the dashed red line in the lower right part of
figure 3.1.6 The unemployment rate increases above the baseline to about 0.5 pp in quarters 6–8 and
then slowly falls back towards the baseline. For an initial zero non-crisis unemployment deviation,
the dashed red line then also shows the effect of the policy rate on the non-crisis unemployment
deviation.

For the benchmark (expected) crisis increase in the unemployment rate, E1 ∆ut , representing the
magnitude of a crisis, CB for simplicity uses the same assumption as in a crisis scenarios discussed
in IMF (2015, para. 41) and in Sveriges Riksbank (2013), that the benchmark crisis increase in the
unemployment rate is deterministic and constant and equal to 5 pp.

the upper right part of figure 3.1. Furthermore, with LAW and a positive non-crisis unemployment
deviation, if a crisis occurs, the unemployment deviation will increase above 5 pp, as shown by
the thick solid red line in the figure. Importantly, LAW leads to a higher crisis unemployment
deviation, not only to a higher non-crisis unemployment deviation.

assumed to be n = 8 quarters. In figure 3.2, the thin blue and thick green lines show the benchmark
probability of a crisis start and benchmark probability of a crisis in future quarters, conditional on
no crisis in quarter 1. The probability of a crisis is equal to the probability of a crisis starting in
the last n quarters. As explained in CB (appendix C), the exact probability of a crisis is given by
a Markov process. It is close to a simple linear approximation equal to the sum of the probabilities
P
of a crisis start over the last n quarters, pt ≈ n−1
τ =0 qt−τ .
All the components of the benchmark marginal cost, (2.11), have now been specified. It is
shown as the thin the red line marked MC in figure 3.3.
The marginal benefit

For the benchmark marginal benefit from a lower probability of a crisis,

(2.12), one needs an estimate of the policy-rate effect on the probability of a crisis, dpt /dī1 , which
in turn depends on the policy-rate effect on the probability of a crisis start, dqt /dī1 , as shown in CB
(appendix C). For a benchmark estimate of the latter, CB combines a benchmark estimate of the
effect of debt on the probability of a crisis start of Schularick and Taylor (2012) with a benchmark
estimate of the policy-rate effect on debt of Sveriges Riksbank (2014a).7
7

IMF (2015, para. 24 and footnote 19) summarizes the estimates of this effect in several papers. It notes that “real
debt levels generally decrease following a temporary monetary policy tightening of 100 bp, by up to 0.3% and 2%,
after 4 to 16 quarters, depending on the model” and that “Sveriges Riksbank (2014a) comes to a middle-of-the-road
result.”

8

Schularick and Taylor (2012) find that the probability of a crisis start depends on lagged real
debt growth. Under the realistic assumption of monetary neutrality, monetary policy has no longrun effect on real debt and thereby no long-run effect on real debt growth. Then the cumulative
policy-rate effect on real debt growth is small or zero. Monetary policy can only shift the probability between periods; reduce it in some quarters and increase it in others. It cannot reduce the
cumulative probability. It follows that the marginal benefit from a lower probability of crisis will be
positive in some periods and negative in other periods. The cumulative marginal benefit of LAW
from a lower probability of a crisis will be small or zero.
In order to stack the cards in favor of LAW, I here instead make the less realistic assumption
that monetary policy has a permanent rather than temporary effect on real debt and modify the
Sveriges Riksbank (2014a) estimate accordingly, as in one of the robustness tests in CB (section
4 and figure 7). Then the marginal benefit from a lower probability is never negative, and the
cumulative marginal benefit from a lower probability is positive.
In order to find a numerical estimate of the marginal benefit from a smaller magnitude of a
crisis, (2.13), one needs to find an estimate of the policy-rate effect on the magnitude of a crisis.
A possible channel is the effect of debt on the magnitude of a crisis combined with the policy-rate
effect on debt. For the former, CB uses the estimate of Flodén (2014). He finds for the OECD
countries that a lower household debt-to-income ratio in 2007 is associated with a lower increase
in the unemployment rate during 2007-2012. As shown in CB, Flodén’s estimate of the effect of
debt to income on the magnitude of a crisis is similar to the estimates of Jordà et al. (2013) and
Krishnamurthy and Muir (2016). For the policy-rate effect on debt to income CB uses the Sveriges
Riksbank (2014a) estimate. As discussed in CB, this estimate appears to be too large, but in order
to stack the cards in favor of LAW, it is nevertheless used.
The net marginal cost The sum of the marginal benefits from a lower probability and smaller
magnitude of a crisis for these assumptions and estimates is shown as the the green line marked
MB in figure 3.3. The net marginal cost, the difference between the marginal cost and the marginal
benefit, is shown as the thick blue line marked NMC.
The main result

Figure 3.4 shows the corresponding (undiscounted) cumulative marginal cost,

marginal benefit, and net marginal cost. (Because the main marginal benefit occurs later than the
main marginal cost, not discounting stacks the cards in favor of LAW.)8 Clearly, the cumulative

marginal cost exceeds the cumulative marginal benefit by a substantial margin.
The result is thus robust to monetary non-neutrality and a permanent policy-rate effect on real
debt. As shown in CB, it is also robust to a smaller policy-rate effect on unemployment; a credit
boom with a higher probability of a crisis; a larger crisis magnitude; a longer crisis duration; larger
policy-rate effects on the probability and duration of a crisis; less effective macroprudential policy;
and using debt to GDP as in Schularick and Taylor (2012, table 4, specification 9), including 5-year
moving averages in Jordà et al. (2016), instead of real debt as a predictor of crises. In particular,
to overturn the result, the policy-rate effects on the probability and magnitude of a crisis need to
be more than 5–40 standard errors larger than the representative benchmark point estimates, in
spite of some of the estimates having large standard errors relative to the point estimates. This all
indicates that the result is quite robust.

Alternative assumptions about the crisis loss level and the cost
of a crisis

The framework laid out in section 2 has the realistic property that the cost of a crisis (the crisis
loss less the non-crisis loss) is larger if the economy is initially weak in the sense having a positive
non-crisis unemployment deviation, that is, a higher non-crisis unemployment rate than the optimal

10

benchmark unemployment rate. This results from the assumption that the crisis unemployment
deviation satisfies (2.4), where the crisis increase in the unemployment rate, ∆ut , is independent
of the non-crisis unemployment deviation, ũnt . This means that the cost of a crisis is given by
∆Lt ≡ Lct − Lnt = (ũnt + ∆ut )2 − (ũnt )2 = (∆ut )2 + 2 ũnt ∆ut ,

(4.1)

the expectation of which equals expression in square brackets on the right side of (2.6). It follows
that the cost of a crisis is increasing in the non-crisis unemployment deviation.
Here we shall look at two alternative and arguably less realistic assumptions used in the literature. The first is that the crisis loss level is independent of the non-crisis unemployment deviation;
the second is that cost of a crisis (the crisis loss less the non-crisis loss) is independent of the
non-crisis unemployment deviation.

4.1

The crisis loss level independent of the non-crisis unemployment deviation

The first alternative assumption can be represented by the assumption that a crisis does not mean
that the unemployment deviation increases by ∆ut ; instead the crisis unemployment deviation
reaches ∆ut , independent of the non-crisis unemployment deviation. That is,
ũct = ∆ut

(4.2)

instead of (2.4), and the crisis loss is given by
Lct = (ũct )2 = (∆ut )2

(4.3)

instead of (2.5). Here ∆ut should now be interpreted as the unemployment-gap equivalent of the
crisis loss level rather than the crisis increase in the unemployment rate. Then the cost of a crisis
satisfies
∆Lt ≡ Lct − Lnt = (∆ut )2 − (ũnt )2

(4.4)

insted of (4.1). It follows that the assumption has the strange implication that the cost of a
crisis is decreasing in the non-crisis loss. In particular, if the economy initially has a non-crisis
unemployment deviation above ∆ut , it would be better off in a crisis, because the unemployment
deviation would then drop to ∆ut .
In terms of figure 3.1, the assumption means that the crisis unemployment deviation is 5 pp,
given by the horizontal black line in the upper right part of the figure, and the crisis loss level is
Lct = 52 = 25, regardless of the non-crisis unemployment deviation.
11

The assumption has been used by Ajello et al. (2016), Diaz Kalan et al. (2015), IMF (2015),
and Svensson (2014, 2015). It has normally been combined with the assumption that any crisis
would occur in the future when the expected non-crisis unemployment deviation would be zero
(for example, that the economy has reached a situation where the unemployment gap is zero and
inflation is on target), in which case the crisis increase and the crisis level of the unemployment
deviation would both be ∆ut . But, as we have seen in the lower right part of figure 3.1, with LAW
the non-crisis unemployment deviation could be higher for several years during which a crisis may
occur.
The expected quarter-t loss then satisfies
E1 Lt = (1 − pt )E1 Lnt + pt E1 Lct = (1 − pt )E1 (ũnt )2 + pt E1 (∆ut )2

(4.5)

instead of (2.6). The corresponding marginal cost of LAW and marginal benefits from lower probability and magnitude of a crisis satisfy

(4.6)
(4.7)
(4.8)

instead of (2.7)-(2.9).
We see that the marginal cost depends on the probability of a non-crisis times the expected
non-crisis unemployment deviation, (1 − pt )E1 ũnt , in (4.6) rather than the expected unemployment
deviation, E1 ũt = (1 − pn )E1 ũnt + pt E1 ũct , in (2.7). It follows that for a zero expected non-crisis
unemployment deviation, the marginal cost will be zero, not positive as in (2.7). Then, if the
marginal benefit is positive, some positive LAW will be optimal. But we will see that the optimal
LAW will be quite small.
We continue to stack the cards in favor of LAW by assuming monetary non-neutrality and a
permanent policy-rate effect on real debt, so that the cumulative marginal benefit from a lower
probability of a crisis is not approximately zero but positive. Let me also retain the benchmark
assumption that ∆ut = 5 pp, although with the different interpretation that ∆ut now represents
the crisis unemployment deviation. The corresponding marginal cost, marginal benefit, and net
marginal cost (NMC) for a zero non-crisis unemployment deviation, corresponding to NL, are shown
in figure 4.1. The marginal cost is flat at zero. The marginal benefit is the same as in figure 3.3.
The net marginal cost equals the negative of the positive marginal benefit.

Because the marginal cost (4.6) is rising relatively fast in the non-crisis unemployment deviation
and the marginal benefit is small, a quite small increase in the policy-rate is sufficient to raise the
(expected) non-crisis unemployment deviation so that the marginal cost becomes positive and the
cumulative marginal cost equals the cumulative marginal benefit, corresponding to (approximately)
optimal LAW. Indeed, a policy-rate increase ∆ī1 of only 18 bp during quarters 1–4 is sufficient,
which will raise the expected non-crisis unemployment deviation to about 9 bp in quarters 6–8
(18% of the benchmark policy-rate effect on the non-crisis unemployment deviation in figure 3.1).
The resulting marginal cost, marginal benefit and net marginal cost are shown in figure 4.2. Here
the cumulative marginal cost and benefit are approximately equal and the cumulative net marginal
cost is approximately zero after about 40 quarters.
Under monetary neutrality, the cumulative marginal benefit is smaller, because the cumulative
marginal benefit of a fall in the probability of a crisis is approximately zero. It can be shown that
then a policy-rate increase of only 4 bp is sufficient to make the cumulative marginal cost equal the
cumulative marginal benefit.
These results are consistent with the main result in Ajello et al. (2016) that the optimal LAW
is quite small. In their case it corresponds to a policy-rate increase of no more than 6 bp. Thus,
even though, for this alternative assumption and loss function, the marginal cost of LAW initially
is zero and some LAW thus is optimal, the approximately optimal LAW is so small that it is clearly
of no practical significance.

4.2

The cost of a crisis independent of the non-crisis unemployment deviation

A second alternative assumption is that the the cost of a crisis (the crisis loss less the non-crisis loss),
is independent of whether the economy is initially weak or not. It has been used by Filardo and
Rungcharoenkitkul (2016, section 4) and Gourio et al. (2017). This assumption can be represented
by the cost of a crisis satisfying
∆Lt ≡ Lct − Lnt = (∆ut )2 ,

(4.9)

where ∆ut now represents the unemployment-gap equivalent of the crisis loss increase rather than
the crisis increase in the unemployment rate.9
Then the expected quarter-t loss and marginal cost satisfy
E1 Lt = (1 − pt )E1 Lnt + pt E1 Lct = E1 Lnt + pt E1 ∆Lt = E1 (ũnt )2 + pt E1 (∆ut )2 ,
MCt ≡ 2 E1 ũnt

(4.10)
(4.11)

whereas the marginal benefits from a fall in the probability and magnitude of a crisis are still given
by (4.7) and (4.8). The only difference between (4.6) and (4.11) is that the latter is slightly larger
because it is multiplied by unity instead of 1 − pt , the probability of a non-crisis in quarter t, which
for the benchmark assumptions equals 0.94 in steady state (see figure 3.2).
Thus, the marginal cost is still zero for a zero expected non-crisis unemployment deviation, so
some LAW is optimal. But because the marginal cost is slightly larger than for the first alternative, the (approximately) optimal policy-rate increase and LAW is slightly smaller. Under the
assumption of non-neutrality and a permanent policy-rate effect on real debt, the optimal policy
rate increase is ∆ī1 = 17 bp, slightly smaller than for the first alternative. The difference would
hardly be noticeable in figures 4.1 and 4.2.
The small optimal LAW is consistent with the results of Gourio et al. (2017, table 2). They find
that the optimal LAW in their case is to reduce the annual probability of a crisis by 7 bp from 2.06%
to 1.99%, implying on average one crisis in 50.3 years instead of one in 48.5 years. In the present
paper, under monetary non-neutrality, the average reduction in the annual probability of a crisis
over 40 quarters is 22 bp for a 1 pp higher policy rate during quarters 1–4. Then a 17 bp higher
policy rate implies an average reduction in the annual probability of a crisis of 0.17 · 22 = 4 bp,
rather similar to the GKS result.
9
Thus, the interpretation of dE1 ∆ut /dī1 is now different from the one in Flodén (2014). I nevertheless use
his estimate so as to make the marginal benefit from a smaller magnitude of a crisis positive (in Filardo and
Rungcharoenkitkul (2016) and Gourio et al. (2017) that marginal benefit is zero because the magnitude of a crisis is assumed exogenous).

14

In summary, the two alternative but arguably less realistic assumptions make the marginal cost
of LAW be zero for a zero expected non-crisis unemployment deviation, making some LAW optimal.
However, as already shown by Ajello et al. (2016) and indicated by the main result of Gourio et al.
(2017), the optimal LAW is too small to be of any practical relevance.

Conclusions

LAW has costs in terms of a weaker economy with higher unemployment and possible benefits in
and possible benefits in the form of a lower probability and smaller magnitude of a crisis. We
have seen that the assumptions about the costs of LAW matter for a cost-benefit analysis of LAW,
in particular for the marginal cost of LAW in a situation of no leaning (NL), where NL refers to
optimal monetary policy under flexible inflation targeting when the probability of a crisis is set
to zero. Under the arguably realistic assumption that the loss in a crisis and the cost of a crisis
(the crisis loss less the non-crisis loss) are higher for a given magnitude of a crisis if the economy
initially is weaker due to LAW, the marginal cost of LAW is positive. For representative empirical
benchmark estimates the marginal cost then exceeds the marginal benefit by a substantial margin.
Under the arguably less realistic assumptions that, for a given magnitude of a crisis, either the
loss in a crisis or the cost of a crisis is independent of whether the economy is initially weaker due
to LAW, the marginal cost of LAW is zero at an initial situation of NL. Then some positive LAW is
optimal. However, for representative empirical benchmark estimates, the marginal benefit is small
and the marginal cost is increasing relatively fast. Then the optimal amount of LAW is quite small.
In particular, it is too small to be economically significant.
