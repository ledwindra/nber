Are Interest Rates Really Low?

ABSTRACT
Contrary to common perception, many fixed-income investors have not suffered unusually low
real interest rates in and after the Great Recession of 2008. This is because taxable investors must
first pay taxes on nominal interest returns, before inflation further reduces their earned real
interest rates. To obtain the same real after-tax yield, investors need more than one-to-one
compensation for inflation. As a result, long-term Treasury bonds have been no less attractive for
taxable investors in 2016 (with a 1.0% post-tax real yield) than they were in 2006 (0.5%), 1976 (–
1.7%), 1966 (0.9%), and 1956 (0.8%), although they have been less attractive than they were in
1996 (2.4%) and 1986 (2.9%). Short-term Treasury bond yields have been on the low side but
have also not been particularly unusual.

[Insert Figure 1 here: Nominal Interest Rates on Short-Term and Long-Term Treasury Notes]

Figure 1 plots the post-war history of nominal interest rates on short-term Treasury
bills and long-run Treasury bonds. The low interest rates towards the end of the sample—
seemingly the lowest since the Korean War—have raised widespread concern. High-ranking
fed officials, like Eric Rosengren (Boston), John Williams (San Francisco), Chris Neely (St.
Louis), Narayana Kocherlakota (Minneapolis), or Jerome Powell (the incoming Federal
Reserve Chair), are on record discussing how low interest rates have caused investors to
“reach for yield,” and thus how low interest rates have at least been partly responsible for
the high stock market. They are not alone. The perception that interest rates have been
unusually low, perhaps because short-term yields have hit their nominal bound of zero, is
also pervasive among journalists, foreign financial and non-financial policy makers, retail
and professional investors—and academics. For example, the secular stagnation theory in
Summers (2014) uses a decline in the real interest rate to make the case for unconventional
monetary policy. Taylor (2014) posits that the Fed held interest rates too low for too long
before the crisis. And so on.
Yet, there is an important aspect often overlooked. Most financial economists use
canonical benchmark models, which are themselves based on “perfect market” assumptions—
the equivalent of a friction-free environment in physics. Such a market ignores not only
market power and information differences, but also all trading costs, liquidity, and taxation.
Thus, many academic papers begin with the qualification that they assume away these
“complications,” and then they proceed to their analysis. In other words, many academic
papers about interest rates and the economy reflexively ignore taxation. For many purposes,
this does not greatly distort the insights of the model. However, in the case of assessing
whether interest rates are low or high, it does. Taxation of nominal yields is a first-order
concern.
For example, consider that the 20-year Treasury bond promised 5.0% in 2006 but “only”
2.2% in 2016. The prevailing inflation rates of 3.2% and 1.3%, respectively, eroded much
of the difference, leaving real interest rates of 1.8% and 1.5%. Yet, even this difference
is irrelevant for the average taxable retail investors in the U.S. The prevailing average

2

marginal tax rate on interest in the economy was about 25% in both years. Assessed
on 5.0% and 2.2%, investors had to pay taxes of 1.25% and 0.55% in 2006 and 2016,
respectively, leaving them with 3.75% and 1.65% in nominal pre-tax terms. In real terms,
investors in 2016 thus earned about 1%, which is not less but rather twice as much as the
0.5% that they earned in 2006. We will point out that similar calculations for the post
World-War-2 sample show that short-term post-tax post-inflation interest have been on the
low side since the financial crisis, but not unusually so by historical standards.
Of course, not all bondholders pay taxes on interest receipts. About 40% of government
bonds are held by other U.S. government institutions themselves. Of the remaining 60%,
about half is held by foreigners. Most foreigners are exempt from U.S. taxes on interest.
Therefore, such foreigners may effectively earn higher rates of return on U.S. Treasuries
than their U.S. retail investors counterparts. The remaining 30% of government debt could
be held either in tax-exempt vehicles (such as in charitable endowments or in 401-K plans)
or in taxable investment accounts.1 Moreover, not all taxable investors are equally taxed.
High-income investors generally pay higher taxes, as do investors in blue states. A single
unique tax rate does not exist, much less a data source that makes it possible to extract the
complete distribution of relevant tax rates. However, there are two reasonable methods to
assess the financial-market relevant taxation on interest payments.
The first method relies on a large sample of anonymized and disclosure-proofed tax
returns over-weighted with high income returns. While the samples are heavily redacted,
the masking does not affect our ability to calculate average marginal tax rates by income
type.

2

Simplifying, our model assesses an investor-averaged rate at which their last

“marginal” dollar in interest receipts was taxed. The model is not only imperfect, but, as
already noted, also applies only to the U.S.-taxed subset of investors, assuming that they
did not have unusual but representative holdings in the Treasury bond market. Moreover,
our main analysis considers only Federal taxation—the web appendix shows that state taxes
1

In all cases, the U.S. effectively pays more in effective interest to foreign and untaxed investors than it
pays to domestic taxable investors. From the perspective of the U.S. government, the real interest rate it pays
is a weighted average of its non-tax-paying and tax-paying bond holders.

would add a further four to five percent on average. Including them would only strengthen
our claim.
[Insert Figure 2 here: Long-Term AAA Municipal and Corporate Yields]

The second method relies on the interest rate differential between taxable Treasury
bonds and tax-exempt highly-rated municipal bonds. If a Treasury bond offers 5% and
an otherwise equivalent perfectly safe “Muni” bond offers 4%, it follows that an investor
with a 20% tax rate on interest income is indifferent between holding either of the two.
Unfortunately, municipal bonds are never exactly the same as Treasury bonds. The issuing
municipal entity may default on repayment. Moreover, Munis have much lower liquidity
(resellability before expiration), a problem that suddenly (and perhaps unexpectedly)
became more acute in the financial crisis of 2009. Fortunately, it is possible to remove an
estimate of the credit and liquidity spread components by comparing highly-rated muni
bonds to highly-rated corporate bonds. Putting together Treasury, municipal AAA-rated,
and corporate AAA-rated bonds allows extracting an “effective” implied tax rate on interest
payments:
Effective Tax Rate = 1 −

Muni AAA Yield
.
Treasury Yield + Corp AAA Yield Spread

Of course, this implied effective tax rate itself depends on the supply and demand
of tax-exempt and taxable investors and investment alternatives, both domestically and
beyond. For example, if only the highest-taxed 1% of investors were holding Treasuries,
the financial market series would indicate implied tax rates close to the maximum personal
interest tax rate.3 If only tax-exempts were holding Treasuries, the effective tax rate series
would indicate values close to zero.

3

The average economy-wide tax rate was significantly below the marginal economy-wide tax rate for
interest income, suggesting that it was higher-earning and higher-taxed individuals who earned and paid
taxes on interest receipts.

4

[Insert Figure 3 here: Tax Rates]

Figure 3 shows that the two tax-rate calculations are not perfectly congruent but
generally economically quite similar when both are available.4 The tax-rate of 20-25% on
interest was also remarkably typical and stable over the sample. However, this tax rate
was also very different from the top statutory rate on interest and/or ordinary income,
which could reach as high as 90% in the 1950s! Even the 1986 Reagan Tax Reform Act
(with lower tax rates, but fewer loopholes, exceptions, and exemptions) did not drastically
reduce the effective tax rate.
The final series necessary to compute investor-relevant real interest rates is inflation.
The relevant inflation rate should be the prevailing contemporary expected inflation rate
over the life of the bond. Our proxy is the CPI-based geometric inflation rate in the year
before, the same year, and the year after the interest rates are measured (reflecting at least
some expectation of the future). Again, our key inference remains largely the same if we
use just the contemporaneous interest rate or a multi-year ex-ante or ex-post inflation rate.
[Insert Figure 4 here: Post-Tax Real Yields on Short-Term 1-Year Treasuries]
[Insert Figure 5 here: Post-Tax Real Yields on Long-Term 20-year Treasuries]

Figures 4 and 5 make our paper’s key point. They plot the time-series of after-tax
inflation-adjusted real interest rates on Treasury yields. The graphs show that real interest
rates have not been unusually low after the crisis when put into the perspective of post-war
history. The post-2008 interest rates have been well within the “ordinary” range. The
2016 yield on short-term Treasuries is only –0.10 standard deviations below its historical
mean. The 2016 yield on long-term Treasuries is even +0.06 standard deviations above its
historical mean.
We can conclude that the prevailing popular notion—that low interest rates have (and
should have been) driving investors towards stocks and other risky investments—seems
exaggerated. Of course, this is not to say that naïve investors after the financial crisis of
4

Year-to-year changes in the tax rates correlate far less. This would be a concern for many other economic
studies, but it is not of great concern in our own study.

5

2008 may not have suffered from money illusion and fled the bond market to “reach for
yield” in the stock market, after all. It is to say that sophisticated taxable investors should
not have reached for yield any more than usual. For them, the “real” short- and long-term
real interest rates in the wake of the Great Recession should have looked by-and-large
mundane.

The graph shows that short-term Treasuries, represented by the 1-Year Treasury Note, have
offered considerably lower yields than long-term Treasuries (20-Year) only in the second
half of the sample. Interest rates peaked in 1981. All series originated from Global Financial
Data (GFD), specifically series IGUSA1D and IGUSA20D, respectively, corresponding to
1-Year and 20-Year Treasuries. The data series are also listed in our web appendix.

The graph shows that (1) a mixture of long-term (20+ year) AAA-rated corporate bonds
offered increasingly higher promised (not expected!) yield spreads from 1965 to 1978
and after 1985; and (2) long-term 20-year AAA-rated municipal bonds have offered lower
promised (not expected!) yield spreads until about 2008. All series originated from Global
Financial Data (GFD). The corporate yield series is MOCAAAD, the “Moody’s Corporate
AAA Yield” index. The municipal bond yield series is MOWAAAW, the “Moody’s 20Y AAA
Muncipal Bond Yield.” The series are also listed in our web appendix.

The black line shows the interest income weighted average marginal Federal (without any state) income tax rates on interest income, as calculated from the Taxsim
model. This interest tax series is now available at http://users.nber.org/~taxsim/
marginal-tax-rates/af84.html.
The blue lines are tax rates computed from the yield differential of non-taxable 20-year
maturity-matched municipal bonds (series MOWAAAW) from GFD, and 20-year Treasury
bonds (series code IGUSA20D), adjusted for the credit and liquidity spread (the difference
between taxable Treasuries and 20+ year AAA corporate bonds (series MOCAAAD).
Despite originating from completely different methods, the NBER and financial tax series
suggest similar marginal average level tax rates on interest—relatively stable and about
20% to 25%.
PS: The red dotted line suggests that the top statutory tax-rate (IRS Historical Table 23 Series 5, available at https://www.irs.gov/statistics/
soi-tax-stats-historical-table-23) should not be used as a proxy for the
effective tax rate in the economy. It was neither greatly reflective of observed paid tax
rates nor of the pricing of financial instruments. The blue dotted line suggests that an
unadjusted Muni minus Treasury spread that is not credit- and liquidity- adjusted would
yield highly misleading estimates, e.g., non-sensible negative estimates after the financial
crisis. Our web appendix investigates this further using tracking regressions.

This graph plots short-term treasury yields after smoothed inflation and Federal taxes have
been removed. Calculating the smoothed inflation rate involves averaging the previous,
current, and subsequent year’s CPI rate. The tax rate used in this graph is from the tax rate
implied by the spread between the 20-year Treasury and municipal bonds, after adjusting
for credit and liquidity, as measured by the spread between 20+ year AAA corporate bonds
and 20-year Treasuries.
After-tax short-term (1-year) real Treasury yields are about zero as of 2016—but this is
still higher than the rates from 1968-1980 and from 2001-2008. At 0%, the rate is more
ordinary than extraordinary. The short-term real-after-tax rate in 2016 is –0.10 standard
deviations relative to its historical series since 1950, corresponding to the 43rd percentile.

The figure is analogous to Figure 4, except that the focus is on longer-term Treasuries.
After-tax long-term (20-year) real Treasury yields are well in line with common yield
patterns—except for the 1982 to 1987 period which showed remarkably high yields. The
long-term real-after-tax rate in 2016 is +0.06 standard deviations relative to its historical
series since 1950, corresponding to the 43rd percentile.

Not For Publication

In the interest of making our paper a “short note” quick read, it has omitted many finer
details. The appendix here provides some of them.

The Tax Code

A.1

The NBER Taxsim Model

Each year since 1960 (except 1961, 1963, and 1965), the Statistics of Income Division of
the IRS has released a public use file derived from the individual income tax filings for
that year. Although the files are redacted to maintain confidentiality, they fairly represent
the distribution of income and tax by component. We then use the NBER tax calculator to
determine the tax liabilities from these files. This calculator takes into account the numerous
details of the tax law, including the maximum tax on earned income, the minimum tax,
special treatment of capital gains, the net investment income tax, income averaging, phaseins and phase-outs of itemized deductions and income-based clawbacks of various credits
deductions, and many other complexities, all of which can potentially influence the required
tax.
The average marginal rate on interest income differs from the average marginal rate
on ordinary income, not only because interest income is distributed differently, but also
because some some features of the tax law treat interest income differently. (Even the
maximum tax on earned income can effect the tax rate on interest income through the
stacking rule.) Nevertheless, interest income was mostly treated the same as ordinary
income. In 1971, a maximum tax rate on earned income resulted in a statutory difference
between 8% to 20% for top income tax brackets. Specifically, the rule capped the tax
on earned income at 60% in 1971 and 50% from 1972-1981 IRS (2016). Despite the
seemingly significant statutory difference, the difference between the average marginal
rates of interest and earned income reached a maximum of 3.1%.
Several other differences could lead to variations between taxes on earned and unearned
income. The earned income tax credit can also lead to some differences in interest income
treatment, primarily effecting lower tax brackets. Payroll (FICA) taxes exclusively effect
earned income. A 3.8% surcharge on investment income was instituted in 2013. Finally,
owners of Treasuries issued prior to 1941 typically received a credit of 3% of interest paid
or, prior to 1955, would not pay the 3% “normal” tax on such income.

A.2

Average Average Taxes versus Average Marginal Taxes

Most of the preceding discussions about statutory tax rates focused on the average marginal
tax rate (on interest rates) of investors. The average total effective tax rate is an alternative
taxation metric. Of course, each individual taxable investor should factor only the marginal
tax rate into the decision making process. The usefulness of the average average tax rate
would be only in assessing the tax burden in the economy. The graph below shows both
the total average marginal statutory tax rate (not just for interest) and the total average
average tax rate. Because of progressivity, the average marginal rate has always been about
10 percentage points higher than the average average rate. The difference was consistent
over time.
5

Naming Convention: The first average pertains across individuals. The second average or marginal
pertains to one single investor’s average or marginal tax over her own total income.

A.3

Inclusion of State Taxes

The tax data series inclusive of state taxes begins in 1978 and terminates in 2008. Because
the point of this paper is about assessing the magnitude of current interest rates against
interest rates from a historical perspective, the combined Federal plus state income tax data
was simply too incomplete to be suitable for the results in the main text. In the appendix
here, we can give some idea of the effect in the subsample in which both Federal and state
tax data were available.
Our graph shows that state taxes increase the average marginal tax rate by about four
to five percentage points. Although meaningful to investors, the impact on our main results
is small: An after-tax marginal yield of about 1.5% would only be reduced by about 0.1%.
Moreover, because the effect stays relatively even over time, the effect of state taxes on the
relative ranking of current interest rates relative to historical interest rates is likely to be
modest.

A.4

Tax Rates and Aggregate Substitution Between Taxable and Tax-Exempt Bonds

Remarkably, the evidence does not suggest large substitution effects by investors from
taxable Treasuries towards non-taxable municipals in high-effective-tax environments.
In more detail, if municipal bond prices fail to adjust for changes in investor marginal
tax rates, investors would likely substitute between municipal bonds and Treasuries until
prices equilibrated. In other words, absent price adjustments, higher marginal tax rates
should incentivize (some) taxable investors to substitute from taxable towards non-taxable
municipal bonds. This should further increase the spread between the two. It should
also induce the ratio of holdings of Treasury bonds by taxable investors over non-taxable
investors to decrease.
However, we see little evidence of such substitution. In detail, as a crude measure,
the plot below divides holders of privately held Treasuries into taxable, tax-exempt, and
unclassified (not shown) investors as a total percentage of all Treasuries outstanding. The
plot also includes the municipal implied tax rate. Unfortunately, this does not isolate
the causal relationship between the municipal bond implied tax rate and Treasury flows,
16

other than accounting for AAA corporate credit/liquidity spreads and inflation. Hence the
absence of substitution flows when municipal bond implied tax rates changed provides little
evidence that investors cared to substitute. Furthermore, Treasury ownership data is both
coarse and of limited availability prior to 1990. Observation of the actual municipal and
Treasury holdings of the counter-parties, and their respective marginal tax rates, would be
a more direct means of observing the influence of marginal tax rates on security selection.
We neither have the data nor is this our primary focus, so we leave this to others for future
study.

This graph plots the relative holdings of Treasury securities by tax-exempt investors and taxable investors. The series
are derived from the “Estimated Ownership of Treasury Securities” tables available at https://www.fiscal.
treasury.gov/fsreports/rpt/treasBulletin/treasBulletin_home.htm. Taxable securities are
defined as the sum of holdings of depository institutions and insurance companies. The sum of pension fund
holdings and state and local government holdings together proxy tax-exempt holdings. Divide these values by
total private Treasury holdings to calculate the values shown. The municipal bond implied tax rate is based on
the spread of 20-year maturity municipal bonds and 20-year Treasuries after a credit and liquidity adjustment
based on 20 to 30 year AAA corporate spreads over 20-year Treasuries.

B

The Credit- and Liquidity-Adjustment For Munis

B.1

Tracking Regressions

Our control approach to credit and liquidity spreads has been to presume that, for equal
maturity bonds,
T-Bond Yield – Muni Yield ≈ Credit and Liquidity Spread + Tax Spread + etc
We used the 20+ year AAA Moody’s corporate spread over 20-year Treasuries as our proxy
for the credit and liquidity spread of AAA Moody’s 20-year municipal bonds over 20-year
Treasuries.
We can check whether the credit and liquidity characteristics between municipal bonds
and corporate bonds were not one-to-one and/or greatly influenced by other time-varying
effects, i.e., different from the implied tax, liquidity, and credit effects. We can use tracking
regressions to test the efficacy of our corporate spread in representing the credit and
liquidity components of municipal bonds, after adjusting for taxes. Similar behavior of AAA
corporate spreads and AAA municipal bond spreads over time, with a coefficient of around
1, would support the hypothesis of an effective proxy of credit and liquidity effects by the
corporate credit and liquidity spread (See our calculation of municipal implied tax rates in
the main text). In brief, our results suggest good evidence in favor of an approximate 1-to-1
covariation of corporate spreads with municipal spreads. This mitigates concern about
omitted (time-varying) distorting effects that would have been picked up by corporate
bond spreads.
Our specification is a tracking regression of
[20y T-Bond – 20y Muni Yield] ≈ γ0 + γ1 × [20y T-Bond – 20y Corporate AAA Yield]
+γ2 × [20y T-Bond · τ] + γ · Covariates
Covariates includes term structure effects and inflation, but could include other series
(e.g. the S&P 500). Only the specification which is not differenced shows the CPI effect as
significant.

(Standard errors in parentheses)
Regressing the 20-year T-Bond – municipal bond spread against the corporate spread suggests a one-to-one
relationship between corporate and municipal spreads. The independent variables, listed on the left hand side,
include the focal 20-year T-Bond – 20+ year AAA corporate spread, as well as some additional covariates. The
tax rate multiplied by the 20-year Treasury bond accounts for the tax-exempt status of muncipal bonds. The
regression includes two different tax rates for robustness. Several other covariates were also included. If the
relationship holds perfectly, the coefficient on the corporate AAA spread would be 100 percentage points. The
regression results show that the spread is close to 100 in standard error terms.

Each regression decomposes the municipal treasury spread into a risk-less tax component and a corporate credit/liquidity component. Regressing the municipal bond spread
against these components suggests how the corporate spread explains the residual difference between Treasuries after-tax and municipal bond rates. Some specifications include
additional covariates to verify robustness. Finally, the relevance of the corporate spread is
tested for resilience against several alternative statutory rates.

This is the same as the previous table except that the dependent and independent variables are differenced. Ideally,
covariates other than the corporate spread and the tax effect should be near zero. In the level version presented in
the previous table, the CPI is significant. Here, even the CPI term is always insignificant. The coefficient on the

The Crossing of the Muni and Treasury Yields after the Crisis

During the financial crisis, the price of Treasuries rose above the price of AAA municipal
bonds. A simple figure can show that this “anomaly” likely originated from changes in the
market-wide prices for credit and liquidity, and not from a negative implied tax rate:

This graph shows that the raw municipal bond yield rose above the equivalent 20-year Treasury yield around
the time of the financial crisis. The dotted line shows that this effect disappears after accounting for the
credit and liquidity components of the municipal bond yield. The adjusted municipal bond yield is calculated
by 20 Yr AAA Muni Yield − (1 − τ) · (20+ Yr AAA Corp Rate − 20 Yr Treasury Yield), where τ is the 20-year
Yr Muni AAA Yield
municipal bond implied tax rate from the standard formula 1 − 20 Yr Treasury20Yield
+ 20+ Yr Corp AAA Spread . Using the
statutory tax rate instead of the municipal implied yield leads to a very similar result.

Rates of Return and Inflation
Breakeven Inflation

Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) seem superficially attractive as a measurement
of inflation. Their yield can be inverted to imply a break-even level of inflation which
would make an investor indifferent between TIPS and the corresponding nominal treasury
security. Unfortunately, there are two problems with using TIPS in the main results. First,

21

the inflation rate implied by TIPS can sometimes differ greatly from other empirical market
metrics, as discussed in great detail in Fleckenstein, Longstaff, and Lustig (2014). Second,
a continuous series for TIPS is only available beginning in 2003.
The following graph compares the 3-year CPI inflation used in our primary analysis
with the TIPS-implied inflation rate from 2003 onward. Recall that our 3-year CPI inflation
rate in the main text averaged CPI inflation across prior, current, and subsequent years.
The graph suggest that the CPI smoothed rate is reasonably close to the TIPS implied rate
in most years for our purposes.

This graph plots both the 10-year TIPS implied break-even inflation rate and the 3-year smoothed CPI inflation
rate (averaged over t–1, t, and t+1). The breakeven rate is substantially similar to the CPI measure except in
2009. This suggests that the main results would be minimally affected by using breakeven as opposed to smoothed
CPI inflation.

Using breakeven rates in our calculations would likely not change our conclusion that
real after-tax rates are not extraordinarily low. In fact, breakeven inflation rates in 2016
were slightly lower than they have been at any other point in the 14-year sample. Naively
plugging in the 2016 breakeven inflation rate instead of smoothed CPI rate to calculate
the 2016 real after-tax interest yield gives an indication as to the impact on the results.
Using the higher breakeven rate leads to a value for the real after-tax 20-year bond of
approximately 0, corresponding to the 27th percentile of after-tax rates dating back to
22

1950. Although lower than the 43rd percentile calculated in the main results, the value is
hardly without precedent.

Data

D.1

Summary Statistics

This section provides additional detail on sources and derivations behind the key data series.
The bulk of the statutory tax rates originated from the NBER TAXSIM database at [http:

//users.nber.org/~taxsim/]. The average marginal tax rate is available at [http://
users.nber.org/~taxsim/allyup/], where the procedure for calculating the average
marginal rate from the raw tax filings is extensively documented. Feenberg and Coutts
(1993) contains additional information on the TAXSIM model. The topord series originates
from the IRS’s website [https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-historical-table-23].
Treasury holding data came from the Department of Treasury (DOT) Treasury Bulletin
Publication, specifically from the 2017, 2012, 2007, 2002, 2000, and 1996 publications.
Global Financial Data (GFD) provided most of our financial series. The nominal oneyear Treasury yields came from series IGUSA1D. The 20-year Treasury yields came from
series IGUSA20D. The principle AAA municipal bond yields are found under GFD ticker
MOMAAAW. This series is also a Moody’s index. Finally, CPI data and information on
breakeven inflation rates originated from FRED.
Many of the remaining series are derived. To calculate the real Treasury yields, the
CPI index for each year was averaged over the past and subsequent years, thus forming
a three-year moving average. The equation

1+ Treasury Yield
1+ CPI rate

− 1 provides the real Treasury

yield from the nominal rate, while the after-tax real Treasury rate similarly stems from
1+ Treasury Yield·(1−τ)
1+ CPI rate

− 1.

The implied municipal bond tax rate may be calculated from the below equation. The
corporate spread consists of the GFD series MOCAAAD net of the 20-year T-Bond nominal
rate. The 0credit series re-calculates the municipal bond implied tax rate with the corporate
credit and liquidity spread set to zero:
Effective Tax Rate = 1 −

This tables presents the key data series used in our main analysis. The series “munitax”
corresponds to the tax rate implied by the spread of 20-year AAA municipal bonds over
20-year Treasuries after adjusting for credit and liquidity using AAA 20+ year corporate
bonds. “0Credit” is the same series absent the credit and liquidity adjustment. “Interesttax”
contains the average tax on interest income. “Topord” is the top statutory tax rate. Real
Treasury yields refer to the nominal yield less the average of the previous, current, and
subsequent years’ CPI inflation rates. “Txd-real” refers to the real yield after the application
of the tax listed in the first column.

Literature

E.1

Other Academic Papers Relating to Taxes and Municipal Bonds

• Elton, Gruber, Agrawal, et al. (2001) discusses the components of the corporate
bond less Treasury yield spread. They use a transition matrix approach to estimate a
default premium, Fama-French factors to estimate a risk premium, and a range of
state tax rates to determine the tax effects. The authors quantify a significant risk
premium, in addition to notable tax and default effects.
• Severn and Stewart (1992) analyze the tax effects on the Treasury corporate spread.
They find that in most states circa 1992, investors benefit from holding state-tax
deductible treasuries. However, the implied tax rate determined from the spread
varies widely over their sample range.
• Elton and Green (1998) study tax and liquidity effects in the pricing of treasuries
using inter-dealer data. They identify a small on-the-run premium due to their value
in the repo market. Their analysis also uncovers limited evidence of a small tax effect
on prices.
• Green and Odegaard (1997) test a null hypothesis of no tax effect in the relative
pricing of treasuries by estimating a structural model. They find evidence of a tax
effect prior to 1986 but no tax effect in subsequent years. Their tests exploited the
difference in the tax treatments of discount and premium bonds, with the difference
mostly eliminated from 1986 tax legislation.
• Elton, Gruber, and Blake (2005) compare the price effects of distributions made by
tax-exempt closed end funds versus those of taxable closed end funds. They find
ceteris paribus that the price drops by a greater amount for tax-exempt funds relative
to taxable funds, with the price of tax-exempt funds falling by more than the dividend.
The authors also determine that tax estimates from the implied dividend rate vary
with the capital gains rate.
• Chalmers (1998) takes an innovative approach in isolating the default risk from
municipal bond yields. Comparing the yields of pre-refunded default free municipal
bonds with ordinary municipal bonds, he finds that default risk does not explain the
difference in after-tax yields between Treasuries and municipal bonds. Municipal
bond yields are generally higher than would be predicted by default risk and tax
effects.
30

• Starks, Yong, and Zheng (2006) examine the behavior of investors in municipal
bond closed-end funds near year end. Their regressions associate January effect
abnormal returns with tax-loss harvesting. Municipal bond CEFs are chosen to isolate
tax-sensitive investors. The results support the tax sensitivity of municipal bond fund
investors.
• Elton and Gruber (1970) create a parsimonious model for the effect of taxes on price
variation at the time of a dividend distribution. They find that the drop increases with
the capital gains rate and decreases with the ordinary tax rate. The authors interpret
the result as a clientele effect, where investors pick firms with dividend policies that
correspond with the respective investor’s tax situation.
• Harris and Piwowar (2006) quantifies liquidity effects in municipal bond markets.
They uncover evidence that municipal bond transactions are expensive, particularly
for taxable investors. The identified costs decline with credit quality.
• Ang, Bhansali, and Xing (2010) back out implicit tax rates on municipal bonds by
studying transactions of discount securities. They calculate that discount municipal
bonds trade at a higher yield after accounting for default risk and liquidity effects.
The results imply tax rates higher than 70% for inter-dealer transactions.

E.2

Some Academic Papers Emphasizing Unusually Low Interest Rates

• Maggio and Kacperczyk (2017) discuss the effect of very low interest rates on the
product offerings of financial institutions. Their analysis principally concerns money
market funds and the degree to which such funds “reach for yield.” Generally funds
affiliated with large institutions are more likely to exit the market, while funds manged
by independent investment firms demonstrate increased tendency to invest in riskier
assets.
• Fischer (2016) examines the persistence of the zero lower bond and the implications
of the persistence on policy. He discusses the effects of negative interest rates and
other central bank monetary tools. The paper also includes his views on stability
regulation.
• Gust et al. (2017) quantify the impact of the zero lower bound by estimating a DSGE
model. They incorporate five types of shocks into the model, including TFP , fiscal,

31

monetary and two types of financial shocks. Their model shows that the lower bound
led to an extra 2% in output contraction given a total estimated contraction of 6%.
• Negro et al. (2017) likewise calibrate a DSGE model, focusing their analysis on
financial frictions and the effects of government policy. They demonstrate that
government intervention mitigated reduced a potential –5.8% drop in output to
–4.4%. The authors further discuss the amplifying effects of the zero lower bound on
several components of the crisis, including deflation expectations and a decline in
demand.
• Gourinchas and Rey (2016) take a global perspective, analyzing the implications of
low real and natural rates across advanced economies. They identify two periods of
low consumption wealth ratios, including the 1920s and the 2000s. Using predictive
regressions, they uncover evidence of the ratio as a leading indicator of low real rates,
and further estimate that real interest rates will remain low until 2021.
• Filipović, Larsson, and Trolle (2017) present a term structure model engineered to
account for the current environment of low interest rates and the issues created by
the zero lower bound. The results are achieved via a Linear-Rational Square Root
Model. Their approach contributes effective simulation of persistent low interest
rates.
• Korinek and Simsek (2016) focuses on the effectiveness of macroprudential policies.
They propose a model where tighter borrowing constraints drive the economy into a
liquidity trap and further force households with accumulated borrowing to de-lever.
The inefficiencies brought by the liquidity trap imply more aggressive policy measures
to insure borrows and a higher inflation target.
• Dell’Ariccia, Laeven, and Suarez (2017) analyze the effect of low short term rates
by measuring the riskiness of new loans from 1997-2011. They find evidence that
reduced short term interest rates leads to more aggressive risk taking. Moreover, the
empirical results indicate that the negative effect increases with bank capital.
• Summers (2014) famous secular stagnation theory uses the decline in the real interest
rate to make the case for unconventional monetary policy. He begins by arguing that
economic growth over the past several decades failed to meet expectations. He then
connects the underwhelming post-crisis recovery with a reduction in the real interest
rates. The analysis drives a recommendation to boost demand via private and public
investment.

• Eggertsson, Mehrotra, and Robbins (2017) quantifies Summers’s hypothesis of a
low negative real interest rate with an overlapping generations model. They find a
natural rate between –1.5% and –2.2% and further simulate a permanently negative
neutral rate using standard macro parameters. Major contributors to the decline in
the natural rate include reductions in productivity growth and the fertility rate.
• Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017) apply a Kalman filter to economic data in
order to estimate, among other measures, the natural rate of interest. They identify
a decline in the neutral interest rate in the US and three other developed economies.
Their approach estimates that the neutral rate fell in the US between 1.5% and 2%
between 2007 and 2016. Their work implies a greater frequency of periods where
monetary policy is constrained by the lower bound.
• Mehrotra (2017) studies how low growth and real interest rates influence the cost
of debt servicing. He finds that the real rate of interest is less than GDP growth,
suggesting a negative debt service cost. The results are tempered by his calculation
that debt servicing costs could turn positive with approximately a 30% probability.
• Taylor (2014) uses the Taylor rule as a benchmark to posit that the Fed held rates too
low for too long before the crisis. Moreover, the low short-term rates fueled origination
of adjustable rate mortgages with low teaser rates. Taylor further claims that increased
regulation, quantitative easing, and zero-rate forward guidance impaired the postcrisis recovery.
• Cochrane (2013) examines the results of New Keynesian DSGE models, and finds
that the policy recommendations following a period of negative interest rates can
change depending on the selected equilibrium. His critique centers on the premise
that the choice of equilibria and hence the predictions of the models are suspect.
• Eggertsson and Krugman (2012) discusses the consequences of rapid deleveraging
event in an economy where agents have substantial debt. Their results suggest
that in a period of low interest rates, government spending should inordinately
increase output. The authors advocate a higher inflation target as a policy measure
for overcoming the liquidity trap.

Various Officials and Others Emphasizing Unusually Low Interest Rates

• Smialek and Mayeda (2017) “Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren told Bloomberg
Television on Friday in Boston that he frets low rates spur a reach for yield, leaving
investors more exposed to a shock.“
• McGeever (2017) notes that Hyun Song Shin, head of research at the Bank for
International Settlements, are pushing investors farther out on the term structure as
they chase for yield.
• In Miller (2017) John Williams of the San Francisco Fed discusses how persistently
low rates could incentivize investors to take greater risk in their search for yield.
• Weissmann (2016) reports on how then candidate Donald Trump stated that Yellen
is using low interest rates to keep the stock market high.
• In Federal-News-Service (2014), Representative Dennis Ross (R-FL) discusses how
the Fed is forcing people to buy stocks by keeping rates low. Yellen also discusses how
low the interest rates acts as an incentive for individuals to invest in higher yielding
securities.
• Appelbaum (2017) summarizes Yellen’s discussions on how the Fed’s yield lowering
mechanisms aided the economy and increased growth.
• Neely (2014) from the St. Louis Fed writes on how QE reduced yields and increased
the price of equities.
• In Crutsinger (2015), Yellen cites low rates of return on bonds as a cause of high
equity prices.
• Hilsenrath (2016) writes in the Wall Street Journal that Fed officials believe low rates
may cause investors to under price risk and thus create a financial bubble.
• Belz (2014) reports how Narayana Kocherlakota of the Minneapolis Fed views low
interest rates as one of many contributors to high asset prices.
• Powell (2017) Powell’s speech to the 77th Annual Meeting of the American Finance
Association includes the view that low rates have supported asset prices, albeit not to
the point of creating a bubble. He also discusses how long-term nominal and real
rates have declined for the past 30 years.
