Do Financial Frictions Explain Chinese Firms’ Saving and Misallocation?
Yan Bai, Dan Lu, and Xu Tian
NBER Working Paper No. 24436
March 2018
JEL No. E2,G3
ABSTRACT
We use firm-level data to identify financial frictions in China and explore the extent to which
they can explain firms' saving and capital misallocation. We first document the features of the
data in terms of firm dynamics and debt financing. State-owned firms have higher leverage and
pay much lower interest rates than non-SOEs. Among privately owned firms, smaller firms have
lower leverage, face higher interest rates, and operate with a higher marginal product of capital.
We then develop a heterogeneous-firm model with two types of financial frictions, default risk,
and a fixed cost of issuing loans. Our model generates endogenous borrowing constraints as
banks consider the firm's productivity, asset, and debt when providing a loan. Using evidence on
the firm size distribution and financing patterns, we estimate the model and find it can explain
aggregate firms' saving and investment and around 50 percent of the dispersion in the marginal
product of capital within private firms, which translates into a TFP loss as high as 12%.

Introduction

A large body of literature has emphasized that financial frictions can generate high saving
and capital misallocation in less-developed countries like China. China has been growing
fast for decades and yet, despite this, it runs a current account surplus, accumulating a large
stock of foreign reserves. This is puzzling, since standard economic theories predict that
capital should flow to countries with fast-growing productivity and thus high returns. One
explanation for this puzzle, advanced in the literature, is that Chinese financial markets are
underdeveloped, leading to distorted financial allocations.1 Privately owned firms, which are
more productive than their state-owned counterparts, rely heavily on internal financing.2
Indeed, saving among firms accounts for around 50 percent of the total saving in China in the
last two decades. Financial frictions can also lead to capital misallocation and low total factor
productivity (TFP). Hsieh and Klenow (2009) quantify the potential extent of misallocation
in China, relative to the US: if capital and labor were hypothetically reallocated in a way that
reduced dispersion of marginal products to US values, China would see a 30-50% increase in
manufacturing TFP.
The existing literature tend to use aggregate data or micro-level firm dynamics to quantify
the role of financial frictions on TFP. Most works, however, ignore firms’ financing patterns.
Our paper fills this gap. We ask to what extent financial frictions, quantified using firm
dynamics and financing patterns, can explain saving and capital misallocation in China.
We start by documenting the salient features of rich, Chinese firm-level data. In particular,
we are interested in how debt financing and firm growth vary across firms. We find that
state-owned firms (SOE) have higher leverage and pay lower interest rates than non-SOEs.
Among privately owned firms, small firms have lower leverage, pay higher interest rates,
grow faster, and face a higher marginal product of capital (MPK) than large firms. Even
though China has been undergoing significant reforms, like the state-owned-enterprise reforms
and financial liberalization, these patterns of debt financing and firm dynamics are observed
consistently over time.
To explain these salient features and quantify the magnitude of financial frictions in China,
we build a heterogeneous-firm model with endogenous default risk and a fixed cost of issuing
loans. All firms produce with a decreasing return to scale technology using capital. They
face stochastic productivity shocks. Adjusting capital (size) is costly due to both adjustment
cost and financing costs. Firms finance investment and dividend payouts from profits and
bank loans. They may default on their loans and secretly operate in financial autarky, with
1

Many papers have addressed this puzzle, for example, Buera and Shin (2009), Song, Storesletten, and
Zilibotti (2011), Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2008), Quadrini, Mendoza, and Rios-Rull (2009).

penalized productivity. Firms with lower productivity, smaller size, and larger amount of
debt default more easily. Banks incorporate these default risk into the loan prices as well
as the fixed cost of issuance. Hence, our model generates endogenous borrowing limits and
differential leverage and interest rates across firms.
In the model, the firm’s size, leverage, and growth are all affected by financial frictions.
When considering external finance via bank loans, firms face a trade-off. On the one hand,
borrowing more is associated with higher default risk and thus higher effective interest
rate. On the other hand, borrowing involves a fixed cost, so that small loans have a high
effective interest rate. In equilibrium, small firms with low assets tend to be more financially
constrained, stay inefficiently small, pay high interest rate, and ultimately face low leverage.
When they experience a good productivity shock, these small firms grow faster, due to their
inefficient size. Our model thus has the potential to match the firm financing pattern in the
data, namely low leverage and high interest rates faced by small firms.
The financial frictions in our model can not only explain the observed firm financing
patterns, but also reflect the realistic frictions in China. According to a survey by Wagle (2000),
around 70 percent of Chinese firms reported that paperwork and relationship with banks as
major obstacles to their application for a formal bank loan. These overhead costs within the
application process make it especially hard for small firms to access to external financing.
Although China has made significant progress in reducing government intervention in the
banking sector, there is still ample evidence that local governments continue to encourage
banks to lend to state-owned banks by extending explicit or implicit government guarantees.
With these guarantees, a bad loan to a state-owned enterprise is not considered as a bad
loan for the banks, since the government will almost surely bail out the firm. By contrast,
absent these government guarantees, privately owned enterprises are in general charged a
much higher interest rate when they borrow from the banks.
We estimate the model using the firm size distribution, dynamics of sales, and financing
patterns. These moments help us identify the productivity process, capital adjustment cost,
and the parameters jointly governing financial frictions. In particular, the productivity process
parameters are mostly related to the distribution of value added and its growth. We therefore
target the shares of value added in the top 5, 10, and 20 percentiles, the mean autocorrelation
of value added, and the standard deviation of growth. The capital adjustment cost affects
how responsive a firm’s investment to shocks. We discipline it with the regression coefficient
of capital growth rate on value added. The fixed issuing cost and productivity loss after
default determine the mean leverage and how leverage and interest rate vary with firm size.
We thus include these moments in our estimation. Overall, the moments in our model closely
match those in the data.
3

With the estimated parameters, we can explore the model implication on capital misallocation. Our model accounts for about 50% of MPK variation, which implies about a 12%
of TFP loss. Hence we explain about one third of China’s TFP loss measured in Hsieh and
Klenow (2009). In the data, firms with low asset, low leverage, and high value added face
higher MPK. The model produces a similar pattern, except regarding the MPK and asset
relationship. Specifically, the correlation between MPK and value added is 0.38 in the model
and 0.11 in the data. The MPK-leverage correlation is -0.05 in the model, which is close to
that in the data, -0.01. The MPK-asset correlation is close to zero in the model, but -0.31 in
the data. This implies that the relatively large MPK of small firms cannot be fully explained
by financial frictions.
Additional statistics that can shed light on financial friction include the correlation of
saving rate and investment rate. Financial frictions increase a firm’s internal return and
lead to a positive correlated saving and investment. The data correlation is 0.58 and the
model correlation is 0.68, indicating a significant level of financial frictions. Our model closely
matches the observed aggregate investment rate, and the ratio of aggregate investment to
aggregate value added is 0.22 in the model versus 0.18 in the data. Our model also matches well
how a firm’s saving and investment co-move with its asset, value added, and leverage across
time. In both the data and the model, larger firms reduce their debt and investment due to
decreasing return to scale; high leverage firms reduce their debt; higher-productivity firms tend
to have higher leverage and also invest more, leading to a positive relation between leverage
and investment; and controlling for capital and debt, firms with larger output increase their
debt and investment. In summary, our model successfully produces the observed cross-section
and within-firm patterns on saving and investment.
Our benchmark model has two types of frictions distorting a firm’s investment decision:
financial frictions and capital adjustment cost. We conduct two analyses to decompose them.
In the first one, we rerun our benchmark model with zero capital adjustment cost while
keeping other parameters constant. In the second one, we shut down the financial frictions
and compute a model with only capital adjustment cost. We find that financial frictions
generate higher marginal returns and tend to distort the investment of less productive firms,
while capital adjustment cost distorts the investment decision more among more productive
firms. Either friction alone produces a large TFP loss, 9.5% under only financial frictions and
13% under only capital adjustment cost. Together, they interact and lead to larger but less
dispersed MPKs across firms, hence a lower misallocation across firms. The model with only
adjustment cost is apparently silent on firms’ financing patterns.
Our paper is related to a large strand of literature in corporate finance which studies
the impact of financial frictions on firm investment and financing patterns. From the early
4

descriptive work of Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen (1988) to the natural experiments and
quantitative exercises,3 we have learned that financial frictions could affect investment and
saving, and that these effects can be large. Our quantitative results show that the effects of
financial frictions on saving and investment are indeed large for Chinese firms. Also, despite
previous literature’s success in matching the mean, standard deviation, or correlation of
certain financial or real variables, they largely fail in matching the firm distribution. This
could potentially lead to biased estimates in their counterfactual experiments due to firms’
heterogeneous responses to the change of primitive parameters. Our analysis is differentiated
by its consideration of a more realistic set of shock processes and financing features, which
both generate a richer set of investment and financing predictions, and enable our model to
do a markedly better job than previous models in matching the empirical firm distribution in
sales, leverage, and interest rate. Furthermore, what is less well understood is the impact
of financing frictions on the allocation of factors of productions across firms. We enter the
picture by studying the impact of financial frictions through the lens of capital misallocation.
We show that financial frictions could explain a large proportion of capital misallocation
across heterogeneous firms, which has important implications for total factor productivity
losses.
Our paper is closely related to the work of Whited and Zhao (2017) and David and
Venkateswaran (2017). Whited and Zhao (2017) focus on the potential welfare gain from
reallocating debt and equity among Chinese firms and estimate the distortion using a static
model and observed data directly. Our paper uses a dynamic model to quantify the impact of
financial frictions, including limited enforcement and credit intermediation cost, on firm saving
and misallocation. David and Venkateswaran (2017) also quantify the contributions of capital
adjustment cost, technology dispersion, and information friction to capital misallocation. We
focus on identifying financial frictions with firm dynamics and financing patterns. The MPK
dispersion is endogenous in our model, while it is exogenous in their work.
Our work also contributes to the growing literature on the effect of misallocation induced
by financial frictions on aggregate TFP. Hsieh and Klenow (2009) use firm-level data to
quantify the potential extent of misallocation in China and India relative to that of the
US. They document sizable gaps in the marginal products of factors across plants in these
emerging markets. Our paper emphasizes the misallocation in Chinese data, due to domestic
financial frictions, by examining firms’ debt financing choices and growth. Midrigan and Xu
(2013) parameterize a financial frictions model to match the salient features of plant-level data
and show that the model does not predict large aggregate TFP losses from misallocation and

that misallocation from financial constraints cannot explain the TFP gap between countries
with little use of external finance and the US. We examine firms’ financing pattern combined
with other salient features, and our exercise suggests that endogenous borrowing constraints
are essential to explain firms’ financing with Chinese data. Cooley and Quadrini (2001)
show that the combination of persistent shocks with financial frictions can account for the
dependence of firm dynamics on size and age.
Our paper is closely related to that of Arellano, Bai, and Zhang (2012), who use crosscountry variations in financial market development to evaluate empirically and quantitatively
the impact of financial frictions on firms’ financing choices and growth rates, with a firm-level
datasets for Europe. Our findings of positive size-leverage relation in China is consistent with
their findings in the less-developed countries. We, however, focus on the effect of financial
frictions on firms’ saving and investment decisions and Chinese capital misallocation measured
by the MPK dispersion and covariance between MPK and firm size.
Our paper is also related to the literature on the implications of financial frictions in
China. Using a growth model, Song, Storesletten, and Zilibotti (2011) show that during
an economic transition high-productivity, non-state-owned firms outgrow low-productivity,
state-owned firms if entrepreneurs have high enough saving. At the same time, the more
financially integrated SOE sector shrinks, forcing domestic saving to be invested abroad,
leading to a foreign surplus. Wang, Wen, and Xu (2012) use two types of capital, financial
and fixed capital, to explain two-way flows. In their model, underdeveloped financial market
in China offer a high rate of returns to fixed capital but low rates of return to financial capital,
relative to the US. As a result, households save abroad and FDI flows in. Most work uses
either aggregate data or ignores firms’ financing patterns. By comparison, our paper uses the
debt financing features observed in the Chinese firm-level data to identify financial frictions
and focuses on their consequences for firms. We quantify the saving and the co-movement
across firms of saving and investment, which can be explained by these frictions.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents key empirical findings
from our sample of Chinese firms, in terms of debt financing, interest rates, growth, and
MPK. Section 3 introduces the model. Section 4 contains the quantitative analysis. Section 5
concludes.

Data

The empirical findings in this paper are based on rich firm-level data, an annual census of
enterprises collected by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics between 1998 and 2007.
The dataset includes all state-owned firms and non state-owned firms with sales over 5 million
6

RMB (about 600,000 US dollars) in the manufacturing sector. It contains all information in
the balance sheet, profit and loss statement, and cash flow statement. We restrict our sample
to firms with positive assets, non-negative total debt, and positive sales, yielding 125,861
firms in 1998 and 306,299 firms in 2007.
In the following analysis, we focus on state-owned enterprises (henceforth SOEs) and
privately owned manufacturing firms (henceforth POEs), since they are more likely to be
impacted by the underdeveloped financial markets and distorted financial allocations in China,
while foreign-owned firms, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan owned firms are less likely to
be affected by local financial conditions. We use information on registration type to classify
SOEs and POEs. SOEs include solely state funded, state joint ownership, and state and
collective joint ownership. In the appendix, we also show results with the least restrictive
definition of SOE, which includes all the firms with positive state assets as well as collective
enterprises. POEs include sole private enterprises, private partnership enterprises, private
limited liability companies, and private shareholding corporations. In our sample, 29 percent
of the firms in 1998 and 2.2 percent in 2007 are strictly defined SOEs, and 8 percent in 1998
and 54 percent in 2007 are POEs.
We first describe overall patterns for firms’ assets, leverage, interest rates, growth, and
the marginal product of capital. Nominal values are deflated using the GDP deflator and
assets are measured by the book value of total assets. To measure the extent of a firm’s
debt financing, we use both leverage and the interest rate. Leverage is defined as the ratio of
total debt to total assets, with total debt including short-term and long-term debt as well as
short-term credit from suppliers. The firm-level interest rate is the ratio of interest payments
to total debt. Firm growth is measured by the growth rate of value added. We use value
added and firms’ fixed assets to compute the marginal product of capital, which is affected
by the capital intensity in each industry. We focus on firms’ relative MPK and normalize
each firm’s value added to the capital ratio by the
within each industry. Specifically,
 mean



Yij

the relative MPK is calculated as log Kij − log Kj for a firm i in industry j.
Table 1 reports descriptive statistics, the mean and standard deviation of assets, value
added, leverage, interest rates and growth rate for SOE and POE over time. Assets and value
added are measured in terms of million RMB. SOE have much more assets than POEs on
average. Both asset distributions are highly skewed, as the mean asset levels are much larger
than the median. In terms of debt financing, SOEs have higher leverage, and they pay much
lower interest rates than POEs. SOEs hold much more assets and have similar median value
added, and its distribution is more dispersed than that for POEs’. POEs also grow faster,
more than twice the rate of SOEs.
Do firms of different sizes finance their projects differently? Figure 1 shows the relation

average, SOEs have lower interest rates. Among POEs, firms’ interest rate decreases with

To study these patterns systematically, we regress the variables of interest on firms’ asset
levels and an interaction of ownership and assets, controlling for industry and year fixed
effects. Table 2 reports the regression results, with leverage, interest rate, growth and MPK
in turn as the dependent variable. The table shows that leverage ratios are significantly lower
for POEs, that interest rates are significantly higher for POEs compared to SOEs, and that
among POEs, smaller firms have a lower leverage, pay higher interest rates, experience faster
growth, and operate with a higher MPK. Although there are sizable changes take place over
time, for example the dramatic contraction of SOEs from 1998 to 2007 due to the SOE reform,
the patterns we described above are consistently observed over time (see the data appendix).

Notes: This table reports the regression results. The estimation sample includes all state-owned firms
and privately owned firms in the manufacturing sector from 1998 to 2007 with sales over 5 million RMB,
non-negative total debt, and positive assets. The dependent variables from columns 1 to 4 are leverage,
interest rate, growth rate, and MPK, respectively. The explanatory variables include firm asset, a dummy
variable which indicates firm ownership, and the interaction of ownership and assets. T-statistics reported in
parentheses are calculated using robust asymptotic standard errors clustered at the four-digit industry level.
All specifications control for both industry and year fixed effects. ∗ ∗ ∗p < 0.01, ∗ ∗ p < 0.05, ∗p < 0.1.

Note that the observed firm financing patterns are not easily reconciled with models with
exogenous borrowing constraints, for example collateral constraints, which generate negative
correlation between firm size and leverage and fail to generate firm-specific interest rates.
This calls for a model with endogenous borrowing constraints.
What type of financial frictions can generate these patterns and are realistic in China?
In our setting, firms can default, and banks provide debt schedules, taking into account
10

firms’ default risk and fixed credit cost. The endogenous borrowing constraints model can
explain the financing patterns across Chinese firms, and it also reflects the realistic financial
frictions in China. Privately owned firms are more productive, but the state-owned banks
have concerns that these firms can run away with their debt. The fixed credit cost captures
banks’ overhead cost and also the cost of obtaining necessary information for each deal. The
model generates endogenous borrowing limits depending on firms’ productivity, assets, and
debt, as in reality banks consider these when providing loans.
How do financial frictions affect the capital allocation, hence the TFP? In addition to
calculating the TFP loss from our estimated model with financial frictions, we show the
distribution of MPK and the correlation between firms’ MPK and productivity in our model.
In general, both the dispersion of M P K and the covariance of z and M P K matter. Consider a
continuum of heterogeneous firms, with production function yi = zi1−α kiα . From the definition
of M P K,

ki = (α) 1−α zi M P Kiα−1 . We can therefore define TFP as

In efficient allocations, the marginal product of capital is equalized across firms, M P Ki =
R
M P Kj . The TFP would then be given by T F P e = ( i zi di )1−α . We can define the TFP loss
by log(T F P e ) − log(T F P ).
If zi and M P Ki are jointly log-normally distributed, Hsieh and Klenow (2009) show that
α
the TFP loss = 12 1−α
var(logM P Ki ), which implies that the loss only depends on dispersion
of M P K. But in general, the covariance of z and M P K also matters, which can be seen
from Equation (1). For example, suppose MPK is Pareto distributed with parameter µ, and
z = M P K ρ , so the correlation between z and M P K depends on ρ. In this case, the TFP loss
α
µ−ρ− α−1
is (µ−ρ)1−α µ−ρ−
α . Figure 3 depicts the TFP loss for different µ and ρ values. The TFP
1
(
α−1 )
loss increases with the variance in MPK. Furthermore, given the same dispersion in MPK,
the TFP loss varies with the MPK-z correlation: a high correlation, i.e. more productive
firms have higher MPK and lead to large losses, since larger z matters more for total output.
Meanwhile, the observed capital misallocation could also be due to other distortions. We
therefore ask to what extent financial frictions disciplined by firm financing patterns can
explain the saving and capital misallocation in China. In the next section, we construct
a model that replicates firms’ debt financing patterns, and then we estimate the model to
match the financing patterns, dynamics, and distribution of sales within the firm-level data,
and use those parameters to quantify firm saving, investment, capital misallocation, and the
TFP loss generated by the frictions.

The Model

We consider a small open economy with a continuum of firms. Financial markets are imperfect
in that firms can only borrow state-uncontingent bonds. Firms can default on their debt,
albeit subject to certain drawbacks. Banks offer firm-specific debt contracts that compensate
for default risk and a fixed cost of lending, as in Arellano, Bai, and Zhang (2012).
Firms produce with a decreasing return to scale technology using capital k as input. The
output of firm i is given by yit = zit1−α kitα , where α captures both the capital share and the
return to scale, and zit is a shock on the measured total factor productivity (TFP).
Firms use internal funds and external borrowings to finance the dividend payout, investment, and existing debt liabilities. The goal of firms is to maximize the life-time present
value of dividends,

where β is the discount factor and η the exogenous exit rate. Firms have the option to default
over their debt. If in default, firms’ debt is being written off. Defaulting firms continue
operating with some productivity loss but are denied access to international financial markets.
New firms enter with probability γ. A firm entering at period t starts with a productivity
e
zte and borrows bet+1 to finance initial size kt+1
. In the second period after entry, the new
e
entrant becomes an incumbent. It will use the capital kt+1
to produce and repay bet+1 . New
entrants’ productivity in the second period follows the same process as that of incumbents.
At period t, after the realization of the TFP shock zt , a non-defaulting incumbent produces
and uses its internal funds and external borrowings bt+1 to finance its new capital purchase
kt+1 , capital adjustment cost Φ(kt , kt+1 ), and dividend payout xt . Given that the firm may
12

default in the future, the borrowing price qt reflects the firm’s future default rate and depends
on current productivity zt , new capital stock for the next period kt+1 , and the borrowing bt+1 .
Intuitively, high, persistent TFP shock zt implies that the future repayment set is large, and
large borrowings imply higher default probability. We assume the adjustment cost takes the
quadratic specification
φ
Φ(kt , kt+1 ) =
2

kt+1 − (1 − δ)kt

kt .

(2)

The firm’s dividend payout is given by
xt = zt1−α ktα + (1 − δ)kt − bt + qt (zt , kt+1 , bt+1 )bt+1 − kt+1 − Φ(kt , kt+1 ).

(3)

There is limited liability and thus
xt ≥ 0.

(4)

Defaulting firms can only use their internal funds to pay out dividends and finance new
investments. They are subject to a productivity loss λ and to the capital adjustment cost.
Dividends are given by
xt = (1 − λ)zt1−α ktα + (1 − δ)kt − kt+1 − Φ(kt , kt+1 ).

(5)

Recursive problem A non-defaulting firm’s state variables include its productivity z,
current capital k, and current bond holding b. Upon observing its productivity shock, a
firm in state (z, k, b) decides whether to default by comparing the default value V d with the
repayment value V c ,
V (z, k, b) = max{V c (z, k, b), V d (z, k)}.
(6)
When V c (z, k, b) ≥ V d (z, k), the firm repays its debt, d(z, k, b) = 0. Otherwise, the firm
defaults with d(z, k, b) = 1.
If it repays, the firm chooses its investment and new borrowings. In particular, it makes a
decision on the next period’s capital k 0 , dividend payout x, and a loan b0 to maximize the
sum of the current dividend and discounted future values
V c (z, k, b) = max

subject to the budget constraint (3) and the non-negative dividend condition (4). Note the

If it defaults and continue to produce, the firm gets its debt written off but remains in
13

financial autarky forever. In this case, the firm chooses dividends and new investments to

subject to the budget constraint after default (5) and the non-negative dividend condition
(4). Note that the non-negative dividend condition for sure can be satisfied in this case, since
firms can always choose kt+1 = (1 − δ)kt and pays zero adjustment cost under the adjustment
cost specification (2).
According to a survey by Wagle (2000), around 70 percent of firms reported that paperwork
and relationships with banks were major obstacles to their application for a formal bank loan.
These overhead costs of the application process make it especially hard for smaller firms to
obtain the access to external financing. Although China has made significant progress in
reducing government intervention in the banking sector, there is still ample evidence that local
governments continue to encourage banks to lend to state-owned banks by extending explicit
or implicit government guarantees. With these guarantees, a bad loan to a state-owned
enterprise is not really considered a bad loan for the banks, since the government will almost
surely bail out the firm. By contrast, absent these government guarantees, privately owned
enterprises are in general charged a much higher interest rate when they borrow from the
banks. These are consistent with our empirical findings in Section 2. To shed light on the
key mechanisms that underlie these stylized facts, we model the Chinese bank lending in the
following way.
We assume that banks are competitive and risk neutral. They have to pay a fixed credit
cost ξ for every loan they issue. The fixed cost captures banks’ overhead cost and also the
cost of obtaining necessary information, building connection, or preparing the paperwork, for
each deal. It is easy to see that, with a fixed cost and everything else constant, the effective
interest rate is lower for larger loans. When b0 > 0, the bond price schedule incorporates both
the fixed cost and the future default probabilities,
q(z, k 0 , b0 )b0 + ξ =

1
E[1 − d (z 0 , k 0 , b0 )]b0
1+r

(9)

When firms save b0 ≤ 0, by making deposits b0 ≤ 0, banks pay the risk-free rate, q = 1/(1 + r).
We intentionally keep the model as parsimonious as possible for tractability and clarity of the
quantitative results. The key mechanism of the model, however, is likely to carry over to an
alternative model with additional realistic features.
Definition 1. A recursive equilibrium consists of decision rules, the value functions of firms,
14

and the bond price schedule such that
1. Given the bond price schedule, the decision rules and value functions solve the firm’s
problem.
2. Given the decision rules and a risk-free rate, the bond price schedule satisfies (9) and
banks break even in expected value.
To understand how firms finance their investment when facing an endogenous borrowing
limit, we plot the bond price schedule and the leverage choices in Figure 4 using the parameters
estimated in the next section. Nonetheless, the features of the bond price schedule and leverage
choices are quite generic. The left panel displays the price schedule as a function of debt
choice, under the median productivity shock and the capital and debt with the largest mass
in the invariant distribution. We scale the debt choice by the firm’s average capital. When
the chosen debt level is less than zero, the firm saves at the risk-free rate. For small loans,
the fixed credit cost reduces the bond price and increases the effective interest rate. For high
enough debt levels, the bond price decreases with the loan size, due to the increase in default
risk. When debt is above 95 percent of the asset, the firm always defaults and the bond price
is flat at zero. In summary, small and large loans are more expensive due to either the fixed
credit cost or the high risk of default.

Figure 4: Bond Price Schedule and Leverage Choice
The right panel of Figure 4 depicts the choice of leverage, as a function of current capital
k for two firms: one with a median level of productivity and one with a low productivity.
Current debt levels have the largest mass in the invariant distribution of each productivity
type. All variables are normalized by each firm’s output. There are two prominent features.
First, for the median-productivity firm, when capital increases, its leverage (b0 /k 0 ) decreases.
This is due to the decreasing return to scale; firms with higher capital stock have lower returns
15

and thus have less incentive to borrow to finance investment. Second, for the firm of a low
productivity, leverage first increases and then decreases with capital. The reason is because
the fixed credit cost is relatively large for such firms, increasing the effective interest rate and
dampening the incentive to borrow and invest. When the current capital level is high, the
fixed cost effect becomes negligible, and the capital return effect dominates. Firms with high
productivity tend to have higher leverage, since their capital returns are higher. Hence, the
differential relationship between size (capital) and leverage in the decision rules for different
firms helps us identify the magnitude of the fixed credit cost.

Quantitative Analysis

In this section, we present the quantitative analysis of the model. In Section 4.1, we estimate
the shock process and key financial parameters using both cross-sectional and time-series data
of sales distribution and financing patterns. Section 4.2 compares out-of-sample statistics in
the model, with data moments to quantify the impact of financial frictions for firm saving,
investment, and capital misallocation. In Section 4.3, we decompose the forces that distort
capital allocations across firms: financial frictions versus capital adjusting friction. Lastly,
Section 4.4 introduces state-owned firms into the model and compute the overall TFP losses.

4.1

Estimation

We assume that the TFP shock of firms has three components: a constant common growth
rate g, a permanent component A, and an idiosyncratic component ν. Specifically, firm i’s
TFP shock at period t is given by zit = (1 + g)t Ai νit . The permanent component follows a
Pareto distribution4 with a shape parameter µ, i.e.
Pr(Ai ≤ a) = 1 − a−µ .

(10)

The idiosyncratic component ν follows an AR(1) process:
log(νit ) = ρ log(νit−1 ) + σεit ,

(11)

where εit follows the standard normal distribution N (0, 1).
To compute the model, we discretize the permanent component A into seven points (A1 ,
A2 , ..., A6 , A7 ). We normalize A1 as 1 and put equal spaces between A1 to A6 . We then
4

Comparing estimates with different processes, we find that a permanent Pareto distribution and an
AR(1) idiosyncratic shocks combined with financial shocks best fit the data.

16

generate the respective probabilities of {π1 , π2 , ..., π6 , π7 } consistent with (10). Hence there
are three parameters to be determined for the permanent component: {A6 , A7 , µ}.5 We follow
Tauchen and Hussey (1991) to discretize the idiosyncratic shock ν.
We assume a quadratic capital adjustment cost as in Equation (2). In the model, if a
firm holds debt b ≥ 0, we define the asset of the firm as its capital k and the leverage as b/k.
Otherwise if b < 0, the asset is k − b and the leverage is zero. The interest rate of the firm
is 1/q(z, k 0 (z, k, b), b0 (z, k, b)) where k 0 (z, k, b) and b0 (z, k, b) are the equilibrium capital and
debt choices, respectively. The value added is given by z 1−α k α . We solve the model using
value function iteration and compute the invariant distribution of firms.
Table 3 presents two sets of parameters. The first set presents the chosen parameters
independent of our model. The second set includes the parameters estimated jointly with the
simulated method of moments (SMM), which chooses model parameters by matching the
moments from a simulated panel of firms to their data counterparts. All data moments are
the average of those between 1998 and 2007.
The first set of parameters is determined with external information and includes {r, δ,
g, α}. Specifically, we pick the annual risk-free rate r = 5% to match the real interest rate
of the U.S during 1998 and 2007, as published by IMF. The capital depreciation rate δ is
chosen to be ten percent annually. The annual growth rate g is 7%, consistent with China’s
average annual GDP growth rate. We choose a value of 0.4 for the production parameter α
to capture both capital share and return to scale.
The second set consists of 13 parameters, discount factor β, fixed financing cost ξ,
productivity loss after default λ, capital adjustment cost φ, persistence of idiosyncratic shock
ρ, volatility of idiosyncratic shock σ, the Pareto parameters µ, A6 , A7 , the parameters related
to entrants ze , ke , be , and the growth rate of number of firms γ. All of these parameters
are estimated jointly to match firm financing pattern, sale distribution, and relative size of
entrants, totaling 13 moments in total.
Panel B of Table 3 reports the simulated and actual moments. The model tightly matches
the data moments. The success of SMM estimation depends on model identification, which
requires that the chosen moments be sensitive to variations in the structural parameters. We
now rationalize these moments.
We consider three moments related to firms’ financing patterns: average leverage, the
leverage-asset slope, and the interest-asset slope. To obtain these two slopes, we first classify
firms into 100 bins according to their assets. We then calculate the average leverage and
interest rates for each asset bin. We run the regressions of leverage or interest rate on asset
5

We conduct sensitivity analysis to make sure our quantitative results are robust to the number of
discretized points for the Pareto distribution.

17

bins. We call the coefficient in the leverage regression as the leverage-asset slope and the one
in the interest rate regression as the interest-asset slope. In our dataset, the average leverage
is 0.58, the leverage-asset slope is 0.17, and the interest-asset slope is -0.08. This implies that
small firms use less debt financing but face a higher interest rate than large firms.
The discount factor β, credit fixed cost ξ, and default cost λ are mostly relevant for a
firm’s leverage decision. The more impatient the firm, the higher the leverage it will employ.
The fixed credit cost ξ affects both mean leverage and the leverage-asset slope. A lower ξ
implies a lower borrowing cost and thus a higher repayment capacity, which in turn raises
leverage. Moreover, ξ affects firms differently. The fixed credit cost to sales is higher for small
firms than for large firms. Facing the high borrowing cost, small firms choose to use less debt
financing, which leads to a positive leverage-asset slope. The fixed credit cost also governs
the interest-asset slope. A high credit cost leads to a high effective interest rate, particularly
for small firms, and a negative interest-asset slope.
The productivity process parameters are mostly related to a firm’s distribution in terms
of value added. We therefore target the distribution, autocorrelation of value added, and the
standard deviation of growth rate of value added. For the value-added distribution, we target
the fractions of value added in the top 5, 10, and 20 percentiles. The distribution is skewed
in that the top five percentile of firms accounts for about 34% of the total value added. The
value-added distribution directly disciplines the permanent Pareto parameters µ, A6 , and
A7 . These parameters would also indirectly change all other moments through their impacts
on the firms’ size distribution. The smaller the shape parameter and the higher the A7 , the
fatter the right tail of firm size and the higher the concentration of market share. Although
the leverage-asset slope within each type of permanent productivity might only be slightly
positive or even negative, with enough heterogeneity in permanent components, the aggregate
leverage-asset schedule can be upward-sloping as the fixed credit cost matters more for low A
firms.
The cross-sectional autocorrelation of value-added is about 0.79, and the standard deviation
of value-added growth is 0.4. The capital adjustment cost affects how responsive a firm’s
investment to shocks are. We thus consider the following regression of capital growth rate:
log kt+1,i − log kt,i = γi + ψ log yt,i + α0 Xt,i + t,i .

(12)

where yt,i and kt,i denotes firm i’s value added and asset at period t, respectively. Control
variable X includes log of assets and net worth. The estimated regression coefficient ψ is 0.11.
The productivity process parameters ρ and σ are most closely related to the persistence
of value added and standard deviation of value-added growth. Capital adjustment cost also

18

affects the volatility of the firms’ value-added growth. The higher the adjustment cost, the
smaller incentive to adjust capital, and the lower the volatility of value-added growth. Both
financial frictions and capital adjustment cost affect ψ, the regression coefficient of capital
growth on value added.
We also match the relative size of entrants to incumbents in terms of assets, value added,
and leverage. In the data, entrants are smaller than incumbents, about 9% smaller in terms
of value added, and 31% smaller in terms of asset. Their leverage is about 10% lower than
than of the incumbent. We also match the fraction of entrants in our dataset, 20 percent on
average.
Overall, the model closely matches the distribution of firms in terms of leverage, interest
rates, and sales distribution: see Figures 5 and 6. In both the model and the data, small firms
have lower leverage and face higher interest rates than larger firms. Value-added distribution
is skewed and concentrated in large firms.
The estimated fixed credit cost is 0.01, about 1.3 percentage of aggregate output. After
default, the productivity loss λ is 3%. The persistence parameter ρ is 0.72, which is within
the range of values estimated in the literature. Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008)
estimate the persistence of traditional TFP about 0.8 using the U.S. Census of Manufactures
data. The value is 0.59 in Gopinath, Kalemli-Özcan, Karabarbounis, and Villegas-Sanchez
(2017) for European firms, and 0.25 in Midrigan and Xu (2013) for Korean firms.
Note that we estimate the productivity parameters jointly with other parameters. A
common practice in the literature, for example Wooldridge (2009), is to estimate firms’
measured total factor productivity directly from data using firms’ value added and inputs.
We do not follow that approach here for two reasons. First, according to our model, firms’
revenues, capital, and debt are jointly affected by the productivity process, costly capital
adjustment, and most importantly financial frictions. Hence, it’s not straightforward to
apply the standard practice. Second, our panel data is very short. The estimated persistence
parameter would be biased.
As is discussed in the literature (see Moll (2014) and Midrigan and Xu (2013) among
others), the productivity process is important on the aggregate implications of financial
frictions. Our estimation strategy therefore targets the cross-section sales distribution,
autocorrelation of value added, and the volatility of value-added growth to greatly pin down
the parameters in the productivity processes. Furthermore, Table 4 shows the out-of-sample
moments of the transition matrix of value added in the model and the data. The estimated
model also captures the transition well. A firm whose valued added is in the top five percentile
has about 70% of probability remaining in this percentile, both in the model and in the data.
In the data, firms in the lower 50th percentiles are also quite persistent, about 80% in the

Model Implications over Capital Misallocation and Saving

We now answer the following question: to what extent is the model with financial frictions
able to account for capital misallocation, as measured by the variation in MPK across firms
and firm-saving and investment behavior?
The upper panel of Table 5 shows the out-of-sample moments of cross-sectional volatilities
of asset, leverage, and MPK in the data and model. In the data, the standard deviation of
asset is 1.14, of leverage is 0.28, and of MPK is 1.21. The model accounts for about 60% of
the observed variations of asset and leverage and 50% of MPK variation. The model implied
TFP loss is around 11.57% in which the efficient TFP is calculated with the productivity
distribution of the incumbent firms in the benchmark, assuming no risk of capital accumulation
and a constant capital return of r + δ. TFP loss in China from misallocation is about 30-50%
in Hsieh and Klenow (2009), hence, our model with endogenous financial frictions explains
about one third of the total misallocation of their estimates. Note that the benchmark model
only includes privately owned firms; the TFP losses are greater when we incorporate SOEs in
Section 4.4.
We also examined which types of firms are more distorted and have higher MPK by
studying the cross-sectional correlations of MPK with lagged observed variables of asset,

22

leverage, and value added. In the data, firms with low assets, low leverage, and high value
added face higher MPK. The model produces a similar pattern except the MPK and asset
relationship. Specifically, the MPK-asset correlation is close to zero in the model, but -0.31 in
the data. The correlation between MPK and value added is 0.38 in the model and 0.11 in the
data. The MPK-leverage correlation is -0.05 in the model, close to that in the data, -0.01.
Further statistics that shed light on financial friction include the correlation of saving rate
and investment rate. Without financial frictions, the Modigliani-Miller theorem holds. Thus,
capital structure is irrelevant for firm value, and saving rate is not well defined. Financial
frictions increase a firm’s internal return and lead to a positive correlation between saving and
investment. We therefore explore this correlation in both our model and data. In the model,
firms either save with financial intermediaries or save in their own capital. Hence firms’ gross
saving is the difference between the value added and the sum of dividend payout and interest
payment, i.e. saving = z 1−α k α − x + (qb0 − b0 ), which also equals the sum of equity growth
and capital depreciation. Our saving in the data is constructed using the second method: i.e.
the sum of change in equity and capital depreciation. The data correlation of saving rate
and investment rate is 0.58 and the model correlation is 0.68, indicating a significant level of
financial frictions. Our model also closely matches the observed aggregate investment rate:
the ratio of aggregate investment to aggregate value added is 0.22 in the model versus 0.18 in
the data.
We also study how a firm’s saving and investment co-move with its asset, value added,
and leverage across time. We run the regression of debt growth and capital growth on the
logged asset, leverage, and logged value added, controlling for industry and year effect in
both the model and the data. Table 6 presents the model and data regression coefficients.
All coefficients are significant, with p-values less than 0.01. Our model effectively matches
the sign and size of the observed regression coefficients. In both the data and model, large
firms reduce their debt and investment due to the decreasing return to scale; high leverage
firms reduce their debt. Across firms, firms with higher permanent productivity tend to have
higher leverage and also invest more, leading to a positive relation between leverage and
investment; controlling for capital and debt, firms with larger output increase their debt and
investment. In summary, our model successfully produces the observed cross-section and
within-firm patterns of saving and investment.

Decomposing Mechanism: Financial Frictions or Capital Adjusting Friction

Our benchmark model has two types of frictions that distort a firm’s investment decision:
financial frictions and capital adjustment cost. Financial frictions include a fixed credit cost of
issuing debt and default risk from limited enforcement. The capital adjustment cost captures
both financial and technology constraints in augmenting or reducing capital. On the one hand,
capital adjustment cost is part of financial frictions, as it captures cost to sell used capital
as in (Cui (2014)). This cost is in particularly large in China, since it has less-developed
secondary markets for capital and less-developed stock market for merger and acquisition. On
the other hand, we can also view the capital adjustment cost as some technology restrictions:
it takes time and materials to install machines and build plants. Not taking a stand on the
intrinsic property of adjustment cost, we decompose two mechanisms, financial frictions and
capital adjustment cost, in preventing firms from choosing efficient capital: financial frictions
and capital adjusting frictions.
We conduct two analyses. First, we rerun our benchmark model with zero capital
adjustment cost while keeping other parameters the same. We call this analysis the OnlyFinancial model. Then, we shut down the financial frictions and compute a model with only
capital adjustment cost by solving recursively the following first-order condition for a firm
with (z, k):
h
i
1
1 + Φ2 (k, k 0 ) =
E αz 01−α k 0α−1 + 1 − δ − Φ1 (k 0 , k 00 )
(13)
1+r
where Φ1 and Φ2 denote the derivatives of the capital adjustment cost Φ over k and k 0 ,
respectively. The adjustment cost function is given by (2). We call this analysis the OnlyAdjustment model. In the latter analysis, none of the financial parameters matter, and we use
the same productivity parameters and capital adjustment cost φ as the benchmark model.
Table 7 shows comparison between our benchmark model and the two comparative statics.
The capital adjustment cost does not significantly affect the average leverage in that the
only-financial-friction model has a leverage of 0.57 close to benchmark number. The capital
adjustment cost, however, affects firms differently in terms of leverage and interest. It
amplifies the effect of the fixed credit cost in the benchmark model. Without it, we need an
even higher fixed credit cost to generate a positive leverage-asset slope or a more negative
interest-asset slope. Capital adjustment cost also greatly matters for the firms’ investment
response to shocks. Without it, firms’ capital growth is quite responsive to the value added
with a coefficient of 1.21, about 7 times larger than the benchmark and the data. This also
demonstrates how we identify the capital adjustment cost. The firms’ value-added distribution
remains almost the same when the adjustment cost is set to zero. With only financial friction,

Notes: This table shows the comparison between the benchmark model, and two alternative models: one has
only financial frictions, the other has only adjustment cost. To calculate the moments for the only-financial
model, we rerun our benchmark model with zero capital adjustment cost while keeping other parameters
the same. To calculate the moments for only-adjustment model, we shut down the financial frictions and
compute a model with only capital adjustment cost.

the firm investment rate is higher, 0.33 versus 0.21 in the benchmark. Firms are thus less
distorted. Nonetheless, financial friction alone generates sizable misallocation and TFP losses
in that the standard deviation of log MPK is 0.53 and TFP loss is 9.46%, compared to 0.58
and 11.57% in the benchmark.
The model with only capital adjustment cost shows larger capital distortion than the
benchmark, see the last column of Table 7. Firms reluctantly increase their size in response
to positive productivity shock, and the regression coefficient ψ is only 0.16. Although the
average investment rate is higher and average capital return is close to r + δ, there are larger
variations in MPK across firms, 0.61, and thus higher TFP loss (13.03%) than the benchmark
case.
To better understand the distortions across models, we also graph the heat maps for the
joint distribution of the expected MPK and productivity. In each subfigure of Figure 7, the
x-axis is the log productivity of firms and the y-axis is the log of expected MPK, demeaned
with the undistorted return of log(r + δ). The graphs depict the density of each combination
of MPK and productivity in the invariant distributions. The brighter the color, the larger
the density. In both the benchmark and the only-adjustment friction, larger productivity
firms face higher distortion due to higher MPK. With only financial frictions, small firms face
higher MPK due to the fixed credit cost.
Overall, both financial friction and capital adjustment cost distort firms’ investment
decisions. Financial frictions generate higher marginal returns and tend to distort the
investment of less productive firms, while capital adjustment cost distorts more the investment
decision of more productive firms. Either friction alone produces a large TFP loss. Together,
they interact and lead to larger but less dispersed MPKs across firms, hence a smaller
misallocation among firms. The total TFP loss in the benchmark is in between those
generated by the two frictions alone.

Introducing SOE

So far we have focused on the privately owned firms and shown that financial frictions can
explain 50% of the dispersion of MPK and generate about 12% of TFP loss within privately
owned firms. Next we quantify the misallocation between POEs and SOEs. SOEs in China can
access financial resources easily; we therefore assume they do not face any financial frictions
and solve the model with only adjustment cost as in (13). We estimate SOE productivity
processes and capital adjustment cost to match the SOE distributions. The upper panel of
Table 8 shows the data and model moments for SOEs. The value added of SOEs is more
skewed than that of POEs, and the top 5 percentile of firms accounts for about 72% of the

other distortions within SOEs and between SOEs and POEs.
To calculate the total TFP loss for all firms, we pool the firms from the benchmark model
and the calibrated SOEs. The share of SOEs is taken from the data, 20% average between
1999 and 2007. The overall TFP loss increases to 15%. Note that there are distortions within
SOEs, so adding a fraction of undistorted firms tends to reduce dispersion, but the dispersion
between POEs and SOEs increases the overall TFP loss. Table 8 also shows that the aggregate
TFP is 35% lower with the existence of SOEs, as SOEs are much less productive.

Conclusion

To what extent do financial frictions matter for Chinese firm saving and capital misallocation?
Most previous papers use either aggregate data or ignore firm-level financing patterns. Our
paper uses the debt financing features observed in the Chinese firm-level data to identify
financial frictions and focuses on their consequences for firms. Using a Chinese firm-level
dataset , we first present evidences on firm dynamics, financing decisions, and capital
misallocation. We find that SOEs have higher leverage, lower interest rates, and lower MPK.
Within POEs, small firms have lower leverage, face higher interest rates, and operate with
a higher marginal product of capital relative to large firms. These patterns are not easily
reconciled with exogenous borrowing constraints. We develop and estimate a heterogeneousfirm model with financial frictions captured by endogenous default risk and a fixed cost of
issuing loans. Using the model, we examine firms’ financing pattern combined with other
29

salient features and find that endogenous borrowing constraints are essential to explain
firms’ financing in Chinese data. Despite previous literature’s success in matching the mean,
standard deviation, or correlation of certain financial or real variables, they largely fail in
matching the firm distribution. This could potentially lead to biased estimates in their
counterfactual experiments due to firms’ heterogeneous responses to the change of primitive
parameters. Our analysis is differentiated from previous literature by its consideration of
a more realistic set of shock processes and financing features, which both generate a richer
set of investment and financing predictions and enable our model to do a markedly better
job than previous models in matching the empirical firm distribution in sales, leverage, and
interest rate.
Our estimated model can explain aggregate firm saving, the co-movement between saving
and investment, the co-movement between firms saving, investment and size, and around 50
percent of the dispersion in the marginal product of capital. Overall, our model generates a
12% TFP loss. Our work also implies that the observed high MPK of small firms cannot be
fully explained by financial frictions. Other sources of distortions, such as taxes, subsidies,
and labor market frictions seem to be important.6 It would be worthwhile to further explore
the contributions of other frictions to firm saving, misallocation, and TFP losses. Future
research along these lines should be fruitful.

6

Yang (2012) argues that these frictions could be important for high Chinese saving.

Notes: The table reports the descriptive statistics of leverage, interest rates, and growth rate for nonstateowned enterprises and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) for some sample years. Interest rate is constructed
using interest payment over debt.

Figure A1 and Figure A2 depict the relations between leverage, interest rate, growth rate,
and MPK with firms asset level for state-owned firms and privately owned firms in year 1999.
These patterns at the beginning of the sample are very similar to the pattern at the end of
the sample, shown in Section 2.
Table A2 and Table A3 show regressions of the interested variables on firms’ asset level,
and the interaction of ownership and firms’ assets, controlling for industry fixed effects, for
year 1999 and 2006, respectively. Similar to the panel regression we show in Section 2, POEs
have lower leverage, higher interest rates, higher growth rate and higher MPK than SOEs.
Among POEs, small firms have a lower leverage, pay high interest rate, and have a larger
growth rates and higher MPK.
