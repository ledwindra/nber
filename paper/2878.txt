PRICE AND OUTPUT ADJUSTMENT IN JAPANESE MANUFACTURING

ABSTRACT

This paper investigates the importance of markup behavior
in Japanese manufacturing. According to the evidence presented,
Japanese firms have varied the markups of prices over marginal
costs in order to limit the effects of exchange rate changes on
output. This behavior is quite different from that found in U.S.

manufacturing where output and employment have borne the main
impact of recent exchange rate changes.

The paper examines markups in nine sectors of manufacturing

than high price elasticities account for this price behavior,
since output is relatively insensitive to prices or exchange
rates.

PRICE AND OUTPUT ADJUSTMENT IN JAPANESE MANUFACTURING

by William H. Branson and Richard C. Marston

In the last fifteen years, manufacturing firms in the United
States and Japan have had to cope with large fluctuations in real

exchange rates. Firms in the two countries are said to have
responded quite differently to these fluctuations.

As shown in

Branson and Love (1988), output and employment in U.S.

manufacturing have varied quite sharply in response to changes in

the real value of the dollar. But Japanese manufacturers are
said to have varied prices, particularly the yen prices of
exports, to limit the effects of changes in the real exchange

rate of the yen on Japanese output and employment. This paper
will study price adjustment in Japanese manufacturing to
determine to what extent price behavior has shielded Japanese
output from fluctuations in the yen.
When there are variations in real exchange rates,

manufacturers can respond in two different ways. They can vary
production in the home country, perhaps shifting between home and

offshore plants. Or they can vary the markups of prices over
marginal costs in order to stabilize the foreign currency prices

of exports. In that case, profit margins rather than output and
employment absorb the impact of the variations in real exchange
rates.

If the yen appreciates, for example, Japanese firms can hold
down the foreign currency prices of their exports by squeezing

2

profit margins at home. The markups of the yen prices of their
products over marginal costs are reduced in order to remain

competitive in foreign markets. As a result, only a fraction of
the yen appreciation is "passed through" into Japanese export
prices expressed in dollars and other foreign currencies.

Manufacturing firms may even follow a differential pricing policy
where they reduce the yen prices of their exports more than they

reduce domestic prices. Such differential pricing, which
involves varying markups for the export market more than domestic
markups, has been called "pricing to market" by Krugman (1987)

and others.1
This paper will examine price and output behavior in nine
sectors of •Tapanese manufacturing which rely substantially on
export markets.

For each industry, separate equations will be

estimated for Japanese wholesale prices and export prices in
order to measure the sensitivity of markups to changes in foreign

prices. And for each of these industries, demand equations will
also be estimated to determine the sensitivity of output to
changes in real exchange rates.

The first section of the paper derives reduced form

equations for prices in an individual industry. The key
departure from earlier studies is the introduction of markup
behavior which alters the relative response of prices and output

to changes in real exchange rates. The second section presents
equations for domestic and export prices by industry, and the
third section presents demand equations.

The final section of

the paper discusses the overall pattern of price and output
adjustment found in Japanese manufacturing.

I. A Model of Markup Behavior
When markups are variable, firms may respond to a rise in
foreign prices by raising their markups rather than by increasing

output and employment. In general, the more responsive are
markups to foreign prices, the less effect do foreign prices have

on output. Because markups are of such central importance, we
develop a model of demand and cost behavior which focuses
specifically on markup behavior.

A. The Markup Function
Consider the behavior of a firm producing a good i for both

the domestic and export markets. This firm has a short run
marginal cost function of the form:
C1 (Zit, Wt, Rt, t),

where C11, C12, C13 >

Z =

output

of good j,

Wt = nominal
Rt = raw

t =

0, C14 < 0,2 and

wage,

materials price,

time.

Marginal cost is assumed to increase as output or factor prices
increase, but to decline over time in response to productivity

growth. Marginal cost in also assumed to be homogeneous of
degree one in wages and raw materials prices, so that Euler's law

4

holds:

C12 Wt +

C13

Rt = C1.3

The firm faces a demand curve

of the form:

Zj

(2)

0, h, h3 > 0, and

where h1 ,

price

of good i,

Qt price of a competing good in foreign currency,

St = exchange

rate (domestic currency price of foreign

currency),

Zt =

total
total

domestic output,
foreign output.

Demand is negatively related to its own relative price, and
positively related to output in either country.
The firm is assumed to set Pit to maximize profits according
to the first order condition:
(3)

h(.)

+

h1 St Qit

—

h1 StC1
Qit

The markup of price over marginal cost can be obtained by
rearranging this first order condition as follows:

(3')

/f1

Pit

=

M

(

+

1t

h(.)

Zt, t)

Notice that the- markup is a function of the same variables as the

demand function on which it is based. The markup can also be
written in terms of the price elasticity of demand,

5

— (h t) / (Zit

=

St Qt) > 0 as follows:
(€ —1).

/

M(.)

If the demand elasticity is constant (case 1 below), then the

markup is also constant. For many demand curves, however, the
elasticity increases and the markup falls as prices rise (case 2
below).

In order to determine how demand and cost functions interact
to determine prices, we totally differentiate the first order

conditions and solve for the domestic price. In the next
section, the elasticities of the price with respect to each of
the independent variables are described in detail.
B. Price Behavior
The price of good i can be expressed in terms of the factors

influencing both demand and cost behavior. The reduced

form

equation for Pit is expressed in terms of percentage changes,

so

the coefficients represent elasticities of price with respect to

the demand and cost variables. In the equation below,

all prices

are deflated by the wage in order to reduce colinearity between
the independent variables in the estimation to follow:

dPit — dWt =
a12

where

dRt — dWt

a5 = [St Qt 14) /
H =

[Stit —

(H C1), and

M(.) C11 h] > a.4

Among the independent variables is one which measures the

relative competitiveness of industry i: StQit / Wt.

The

coefficient of this relative price, which we call the sectoral
real exchange rate, measures the influence of foreign prices on

domestic prices in the same industry. The size of this real
exchange rate coefficient depends on two different factors, the
price elasticity of demand (c) and the elasticity of the markup

with respQct to prices (which we label 6). In order to
investigate the influence of these two elasticities, we consider
two special cases:

Case 1: Constant markups with increasing marginal cost.

If the elasticity of demand is constant, which would be the
case if the demand curve is loglinear, then the markup is also
constant (N1 = N2 = N3 =

0).

So the coefficient of the real

exchange rate reduces to

a11 =

1

—

1
_______________________

[1

+ 6 (C11 Zit/Ci)]

As long as marginal cost increases with output (C11 >

0),

then

this coefficient lies between zero and one. An appreciation of
the yen, by raising export prices in foreign currency, reduces

output demanded. So marginal costs fall, and so do prices in

But

since there is no change in the markup of prices over

marginal costs, the fall in prices is accomplished only through

variations in output leading to reductions in marginal cost. So
this case cannot explain the lack of output adjustment in Japan;
with constant demand elasticities, there is no tradeoff between
price adjustment and output adjustment.
A higher demand elasticity increases the real exchange rate

coefficient. And as this elasticity approaches infinity,
approaches one, while all other coefficients in (4) approach

zero. So in this polar case where domestic and foreign goods are
perfect substitutes, the price equation collapses to the law of

one price (in percentage changes): d(Pit)/Pit =

d(St

Qjt)/(St

Short of this polar case, higher demand elasticities

result in reater output variation, since any movement in
relative prices leads to changes in output proportional to this
elasticity.

Case 2: Variable markups with constant marginal cost.

A second special case focuses specifically on markup

behavior. We assume that markups decline with increases in
prices (i.e., M1 <

0).

Such markup behavior is characteristic of

any demand curve less convex (more linear) than the loglinear

curve, including the linear case itself.5 To isolate the role of
markups, assume that marginal cost is constant (C11 = 0) so that
the last term in the denominator of ail involving the elasticity
of demand is zero. -Then the coefficient of the real exchange

8

rate

is given by:

au =

1

____

—

where 6 is the elasticity of the markup with respect to price:

6 =

(M

Pit)/(M(.) St Qut)

<

0.

As & increases in absolute

value, ail also increases. So as the demand curve becomes more
linear, the effect of higher foreign prices is enhanced.

Consider the effects of an appreciation of the yen once

again. This appreciation raises the foreign currency price of

exports. But the exporting firm

reduces

the markup to limit th

rise in that price. So the firm's price in domestic currency

falls. If the firm

"prices

to market", then it may reduce the

lomestic currency price of its exports more than the price of its

domestic goods. A greater sensitivity of the markup to prices
(i.e., a higher S in absolute value) increases the response of

the firm's prices to the appreciation. And it reduces the impact
of the appreciation on output. So in this case of a variable
markup, there

a tradeoff between price variations and output

variations.

In the case of a linear demand curve, we can also relate the
size of & to the elasticity of demand through the equation:
S = — (1 +

e)/(

— 1) < 0.

Since an increase in the elasticity

of demand reduces the absolute value of 6, it also reduces ail.

So in contrast to case 1, the lower the demand elasticity, the
higher is a11, the coefficient of the real exchange rate.

Consider the implications for the behavior of output. If markup
behavior is responsible for a high coefficient for the real

Q

exchange rate, then output nay be relatively unresponsive to the
real exchange rate because of low demand elasticities even though
domestic prices are highly responsive to the real exchange rate.
General Case: Variable markups and increasing marginal cost.

We now consider the more general case where markups are
allowed to fall as prices rise and where marginal costs may
increase with output: M1

0, C11

o.6 The coefficient of the

real exchange rate can be written as follows:

ail

1 —

1
______________________

+

(C11 Zit/Cl)]

The denominator of the fraction above must be positive.7 So aj
must lie between 'ero and one. As in case 1, moreover, an
increase in e, given 6, increases ai, while as in case 2 an
increase in the absolute value of 6, given c, also increases °il•

So if we find that a1 is large in the equations estimated below,
we can attribute the response of domestic prices to the real
exchange rate to one of two influences: high demand elasticities

or variable markup elasticities. Only by examining output
behavior will we be able to distinquish between these two
influences.

To round out the analysis of the price equation, we note
that ai2 can be written as

i2 = RtC13
So

0

i2 < 1.

(1 —

An increase in e or in the absolute value of 6,

moreover, reduces the size of this coefficient. The coefficients

10

of domestic and foreign output, 0j3 and

are positive as long

as the markup derivatives, N2 and M3, are positive or zero.8

Finally, the coefficient of time, ,

is

negative, since

increasing productivity reduces marginal costs.
II. Empirical Price Equations
In this section, we report equations explaining price

changes in Japanese manufacturing as a function of changes in

foreign prices as well as other variables. We focus on those
sectors of manufacturing with significant reliance on exports for
which there are series for export prices as well as domestic

prices available. Nine sectors in all are studied: textiles,
chemicals, three metal sectors, and four machinery sectors. The
machinery sectors alone (general machinery, electrical machinery,

transport equipment, and precision instruments) account for over
half of Japanese exports.

A. Description of the Data
The data appendix describes the series used in the

estimation and reports the source of each series. This section
briefly describes these series and outlines the specification of
the price equations.

For the nine sectors studied, the Bank of Japan reports
prices for the export market separate from prices for the

domestic market. The domestic prices are those reported at the
primary wholesale level for sale in Japan, while the export

prices are FOB export prices expressed in yen. The product

11

categories are listed in Table 1. The price equations to be
estimated have as a dependent variable the domesUc or export
price for that sector relative to the wage in Japanese
manufacturing.

(The relative domestic price is denoted PWj,

while the relative export price is denoted 'it)• To reduce
spurious correlation between the price series, all variables are
expressed as first-differences (of their log values).

The independent variables include a sectoral real exchange
rate (RWit) defined as the U.S. producer price for that sector,
converted into yen, deflated by the Japanese manufacturing wage.

It would have been preferable to use a weighted average of many
countries' prices in forming this sectoral real exchange rate,

hut it is difficult to obtain disaggregatd prices defined on a
consistent basis across countries. The coefficient of this
sectoral real exchange rate measures the elasticity of the
domestic or export price with respect to a one percent change in

the foreign price or exchange rate. This coefficient should be
larger in the export price equation than in the domestic price
equation if Japanese firms "price to market", varying export
price markups more than domestic markups as foreign prices
change.9

The second independent variable is the relative price of

imported raw materials (it) defined as the import price of
petroleum, coal and natural gas expressed in yen relative to the

wage.1° Japanese output (1t) also enters as an independent
variable. To reduce colinearity between output and the time

12

trend, this variable is expressed as the cyclical deviation from
a tine trend, formed by fitting a time trend to the log of

Japanese industrial production.11 A variable representing
cyclical movements in U.S. industrial production was also
included in the equation, but proved to be statistically
insignificant throughout the estimation.

Cyclical output should

have a positive coefficient, since this variable reflects the
influence of higher demand on prices and higher markups due to

that increased demand. With cyclical output replacing actual
output, the time trend (t) now reflects two influences,

productivity growth and the trend growth in demand. Since the
price equation is expressed in first differences, the constant in

Lhis ecuatior mPurps any trend influence on prices.
The equation estimated for sector i has the following form:

(5) PWj =

E

ailj RWi,t_j +

Zj ai3j CIPt_j +

Zj ai2j i,t-j
a10

+

+

Uj,

where the dependent variable is either

PWt = the change in the log of the Japanese domestic
wholesale price for sector i less the wage in manufacturing,
or

PXWIt = the change in the log of the Japanese wholesale
price for exports (in yen) for sector i less the wage in
manufacturing,
and where

RWit = the change in the log of the U.S. wholesale price
for sector i converted into yen at the current spot rate
less the wage in manufacturing,

it the change in the log of the price of imported
petroleum, coal, and natural gas less the wage in
manufacturing, and
CIPt = the change in the log of Japanese cyclical
production (measured as the deviation from the log trend of
industrial production).

The period of estimation begins in January 1974, following the
start of generalized floating, and ends in December 1986, so

there are 156 monthly observations. Since the data are not
seasonally adjusted,12 we include seasonal dummy variables in
each equation.13
B. Estimation Results

Table 1 reports the price equations for the nine sectors of

Japanese manufacturing with significant export activity. The
table reports the coefficients for the relative price terms,
output terms, and constant as well as four summary statistics:
the adjusted R1 ,

the

standard error of the equation, the serial

correlation coefficient (Rho) when it is statistically
significant, and the Durbin-Watson statistic.

Since the estimation employs monthly data, we fit

polynominal distributed lags to each independent variable. The
lags proved to be quite short, however, particularly those for
the relative price terms.

A linear lag of only two months was

found for the sectoral real exchange rates and the relative price

of imported materials. This suggests that price changes in Japan
occur quite rapidly following changes in exchange rates or

foreign prices. In the case of cyclical output, the lag was four

months long. In the table, we report the sum of the coefficients
for each lag distribution and the t—statistic for their sum.

The sectoral real exchange rate enters significantly in all

eighteen regressions. Recall that the coefficient of this term
measures the elasticity of the domestic or export price with

respect to changes in the foreign price or exchange rate. In
only one equation, the export price equation for chemicals, is
the foreign price coefficient insignificantly different from one
(at the five percent level), but in many sectors it is much

16

larger than zero. The elasticity varies between 0.169 for
domestic iron and sceel prices to 0.890 for export prices in the
chemical sector.

In all sectors, the foreign price coefficient in the export

equation exceeds that in the domestic equation. In nany sectors,
such as chemicals, iron and steel and electrical machinery, the
price sensitivity of export prices is much larger than that of
domestic prices, which suggests that there is substantial pricing
to market in these sectors.14
In seventeen of the eighteen equations, the coefficient of
the imported materials price has the expected positive sign,

although in only twelve of these equations is the coefficient

statistically significant at the five percent level. The
coefficients are generally much smaller than those of the foreign
price term, which suggests a relatively low dependence on
imported materials in these sectors.

Cyclical movements in Japanese output are statistically
significant in six of the eighteen equations, and have the

correct positive sign in all equations.15 The coefficients
represent elasticities of domestic or export prices with respect

to changes in output. In the textile sector, for example, a one
percent increase in output above trend leads to a rise in the
price by .784 percent.

The constant term in each regression measures the influence
of trends on the price level, since the regressions relate

changes in prices to other variables. The theoretical model

17

suggests an ambiguous sign for the trend term, since higher
output raises demand and therefore raises prices, while higher

productivity lowers prices. The influence of productivity growth
apppears to be dominant, since the constant is negative in all
eighteen equations, although in only eight equations is the
coefficient statistically significant at the five percent level.

Most of the statistically significant trends occur in the four
machinery sectors where productivity growth has been especially
rapid. 16

The fit of these equations is excellent considering that

they are estimated in first-difference form. Overall, the
results indicate that changes in foreign prices are the most
important determinant of price changes in Japan. at least in the
export-oriented sectors of manufacturing that are studied here.

Other influences are also important, including cyclical movements
in output, but domestic and export prices appear to be more
systematically related to foreign prices than any other variable.

III. Demand Behavior
The results reported in Table 1 suggest that, for many
sectors of Japanese manufacturing, foreign prices and exchange
rates have a strong influence on Japanese prices.

But as

explained in section 1, there are two competing explanations for
these results corresponding to the two ways in which foreign

prices affect domestic prices. The first involves price
elasticities. If demand has a high price elasticity, then
Japanese prices will be relatively sensitive to foreign prices.

18

In this case, output should also be relatively sensitive to

foreign prices. The second way involves markup behavioi. If
markups are relatively responsive to price changes, then Japanese
prices will once again be relatively sensitive to foreign prices.

But in this case, output should be relatively jsensitive to
price changes.

To help distinguish between these two cases, we now
investigate the price elasticity of demand (E)

by

estimating

demand equations for each sector. The demand equation (2) is
written in terms of percentage changes as follows:
d

The empirical counterpart of (6) relates (the percentage

where IPj = the change in the log of industrial production in
industry i,
=

CIPt =

the

change in the log of the Japanese export
price for sector i relative to the corresponding
U.S. wholesale price expressed in yen,

the

change in the log of Japanese cyclical
industrial production (measured as the deviation of
the log of industrial production from its trend).

The series for industrial production represent monthly data
disaggregated according to the same nine industry classification

as are the wholesale price series. The export price rather than
domestic price is employed as an independent variable since it is
the export component of demand that is likely to be the most

price-sensitive. Because the current export price is likely to
be correlated with the error term in this equation, QnJ,1 lagged

values of Qt are included in the equation. The period of
estimation extends from January 1974 to December 1986. Since the
industrial production series are not seasonally adjusted, we

include seasonal dummy variables in each equation. As in the
price equation, the constant term reflects the combined influence
of productivity growth and the trend growth of demand.
Table 2 reports demand equations for the nine sectors of

Japanese manufacturing with significant export activity. The
table reports the coefficients for the relative price and output

terms, constant, as well as summary statistics. We fit a ten
month, second degree, polynominal lag to the price and output
terms; the coefficients reported are for the sum of these lags.
Unlike the corresponding price equations in Table 1, these
demand equations exhibit little sensitivity to foreign prices.
In all nine equations, the relative price terms are statistically
insignificant, and are positive rather than negative in seven of
these equations.3-7 The cyclical income terms, in contrast, are
all of the correct sign and are statistically significant in

seven of the nine equations. The constant terms, moreover, are

positive in all but one equation, although they are statistically

significant in only two equations. So income, particularly
cyclical income, seems to play a major role in the demand
equations, but relative prices do not.

Because demand does not appear to be significantly affected
by relative prices, one of the two explanations for the results

reported in Table 1 must be rejected. High demand elasticities
can hardly account for the price responsiveness reported in that

table. Instead, the explanation seems to be that markups are
sufficiently variable to account for the high correlation between

foreign and domestic prices. As explained earlier, if markups
are sufficiently variable, then domestic prices will respond to

foreign prices even though demand elasticities are low. And with
demand elasticities low, Japanese output will not be very
sensitive to relative price changes.

IV. Concluding Comments: An Agenda for Future Research
This paper has suggested that markup behavior may be the key
to understanding the patterns of price and output adjustment

found in Japanese manufacturing. We have provided evidence that
Japanese firms have varied markups systematically in order to

limit the effects of exchange rate changes on output. This
behavior is quite different from that found in U.S. manufacturing
where output and employment has borne the main impact of exchange
rate changes.

In future we hope to extend this analysis by examining

Japanese demand behavior in more detail. In the model outlined
above, we have not distinguished between domestic and foreign

demand for Japanese goods. It is possible that the output
behavior we observe is due to different markup behavior in the
two markets, a possibility consistent with higher coefficients

for foreign prices in the export price equations. Consider a
model of "pricing to market" in which the markups of export
prices in domestic currency over marginal costs are varied
systematically so as to limit changes in export prices in foreign

22

currenqy. The markups of export prices will vary widely, while
those in-the domestic market may not vary much at all. To
investiç-ate this possibility, we hope to estimate separate demand

equations for export and domestic markets if we can obtain
quantity data disaggregated by market.

FOOTNOTES

1. Other recent studies of pricing to market and the related
phenomena of currency pass—through include Feenstra (1987), Froot
and Klemperer (1988), Giovannini (1988), Ohno (1988), and
Scheinbri (1988).

2. The subscripts refer to the arguments of the function; C1, for
example, is marginal cost, or the derivative of total cost with
respect to output, while C12 is the derivative of marginal cost
with respect to the second argument, wages.
3. In the case of a Cobb—Douglas production function, for
example, the short run marginal cost function is homogeneous of
degree one in the prices of the variable factors, Wt and Rt.
4. The second order conditions require that H >

0.

5. Krugman (1987) and Feenstra (1987) also focus on the role of
demand curve convexity in determining the influence of exchange
rates on domestic prices, although they focus on the pass-through
of foreign costs into export prices. Krugman points out that in
the liter?ture on trade policy under imperfect competition, the
effe'ts of riffs is shown to depend on the convexity of the
demand curve.

6. we cannot rule out other cases a priori. For example, markups
would be positively related to prices if the demand curve were
more convex than the loglinear case. And marginal costs may
decline rather than increase with output. We focus on the more
normal case described here because it is consistent with the
empirical results below.

7. Note that as long as M1

0, then 6

0.

8. These coefficients may be positive even if M2 and M3 are
negative since the second terms in the expressions for ai3 and
ai4 are positive.
9. If export prices expressed in yen vary more than domestic
prices, this in itself is evidence of pricing to market and
variable markups. If demand elasticities are constant, on the
other hand, markups are constant and export prices in yen vary
just as much as domestic prices of the same product (i.e., as
much as marginal costs vary).
10. This component of raw materials, representing forty-eight
percent of the total import price index, performed better than
the price series for imported raw materials and fuels
(representing sixty—one percent of the import index).

11. The trend equation is estimated over the period January 1973
to December 1986. Because Japanese growth appears to have slowed
after the first oil shock, we estimated a separate trend for the
period prior to July 1974 and a separate intercept term for the
period through the end of 1974 when the economy reached its
lowest point.
12. The Japanese wage in manufacturing is seasonally adjusted,
since the unadjusted wage has a strong seasonal component
corresponding to year—end bonuses.

13. The seasonal dummy variables are defined as Vi = Si - Si for
Sl, where Si is a normal seasonal variable (with
1, and Vl
I
1 in the ith month and 0 elsewhere). The coefficient of the Vl
term provides an estimate of the constant independent of any
seasonal effect.
14. As explained above, if export prices expressed in yen vary
more than domestic prices, this in itself is evidence of pricing
to market and of variable markups.
15. cyclical movements in U.S. industrial production proved to be
statistically insignificant in the equations.
16. Since a reduced form equation is being estimated, it is
difficult to interpret the magnitude of the coefficients in terms
of productivity growth rates. Even the relative magnitude of the
trend terms across equations will depend on structural
coefficients rather than just on the productivity growth rates.

17. The price terms are statistically insignificant regardless of
the length of the lag or the degree of the polynomial being
fitted.
