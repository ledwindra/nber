Why Money Announcements Move Interest Rates:
An Answer From The Foreign Exchange Market

ABSTRACT

On a Friday that the Fed announces a money supply greater than had
been anticipated, interest rates move up in response. Why? One
explanation is that the market perceives the fluctuation in the money
stock as an unintended deviation from the Fed's target growth rate that
will be reversed in subsequent periods. The anticipation of this future
tightening drives up interest rates today. A second explanation is that
the market perceives the increase in the money supply as signalling a
higher target growth rate. The expected future inflation rate rises,
which is reflected in a higher nominal Interest rate.
This paper offers grounds for choosing between the two possible
explanations: evidence from the exchange market. Under the first
explanation, anticipated future tightening, one would expect the dollar
to appreciate against foreign currencies. Under the second explanation,
expected inflation, one would expect it to depreciate. We render these
claims more concrete by a formal model, a generalization of the
Dornbusch overshooting model. Then we use the mark/dollar rate to
answer the question. We find a statistically significant tendency for
the dollar to appreciate following positive money supply surprises.
This supports the first explanation.

1. Why does the interest rate rise after announcements of money growth?
One striking empirical regularity in recent years has been the tendency
for interest rates to rise whenever the Federal Reserve Board announces an
increase in the money supply greater than had previously been expected.
This relationship appears almost every week in credit market developments
as reported in the financial press, and is borne out by Table 4 below.1 At
first glance, the phenomenon might seem puzzling to a student of textbook
IS—LM models, which predict that liquidity effects should make interest

rates fall when the authorities expand the money supply. At second glance,
however, the student should realize that there is not necessarily an in-

consistency. Interest rates may indeed fall during a week in which the

Fed increases the money supply. But when the announcement occurs ten days
later, interest rates will change purely because the announcement alters
the market's expectations of future monetary policy.

There is, in fact, an explanation of this weekly occurrence that is
consistent with the Keynesian (IS—LM) view that tighter money causes the

real interest rate to rise. Money growth that is faster than expected by
the market is trpical1y faster than what was expected by the Fed as well.
Weekly blips in the money supply are unintended errors——due to fluctuations
in private money demand or in the banking system——beyond the monetary

authorities' control. The Fed subsequently corrects the errors to bring

the money supply back in line with its target growth rates. Thus the
announcement of a large money supply increase generates the expectation
of future contraction in credit, and higher interest rates. In anticipation, interest rates jump on bonds with terms that include the period

in which money markets will be tighter. The fact that rates on even very

2

short—term bonds increase indicates a belief that the Fed wastes no time in
beginning to correct errors.2

This explanation of the announcement effect on interest rates is
commonly given by staff writers of the Wall Street Journal, especially in
the Monday column on credit markets.

The Federal Reserve System may be forced to boost the discount rate from 12% in its battle to halt the soaring growth of
the nation's money supply...Fears of Fed credit tightening sent
the markets reeling Friday after release of the latest money
supply statistics. Prices of long—term U.S. government bonds
tumbled by more than a point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount
of securities. Interest rate increases of
percentage point
were common on short—term securities. (January 25, 1982)

However, there is a second, very different, explanation of the
phenomenon that, ironically, is propounded in the same newspaper, but in

the editorial column. The announcement of rapid money growth causes the
market to raise its estimate of the Fed's target money growth rate, the
expected inflation rate rises, and it is reflected in a higher nominal
interest rate.

A reduction in money growth will constrict the supply of
credit, but it will also lower inflationary expectations.
If the markets are convinced the Fed is really serious about
slowing money growth, the drop in the inflationary premium
will swamp the impact on the real rate of interest, and
nominal rates will tall. This is precisely what seems to
be happening this week in the wake of the latest money
supply figures. (January 7, 1981)

One might think of other ways of describing the positive correlation

between money announcements and interest rate changes. But they can be

seen to fall into the category of one or the other of these two competing

3

explanations, if one groups them by reference to the decomposition of the
nominal interest rate into the real interest rate and the expected infla-

tion rate. According to the first explanation, a large money announcement
raises the nominal interest rate because it raises the real interest rate.

We will refer to this as the liquidity effect. According to the second
explanation, the announcement raises the nominal interest rate because it

raises expected inflation. We will refer to this as the inflation premium
effect.

It would be useful to be able to distinguish between the two hypotheses, since they might give an indication of how the market views the

Fed's policies. The liquidity effect requires that the market expect the
Fed to stick to its pre—announced money growth target and to correct any

aberration. The inflation premium explanation implies that the Fed is
not trusted to keep a steady course; the market, like the Wall Street
Journal editors, is ready to interpret any deviation in money growth as
a signal that the Fed is changing its targets.
Fortunately, there is a quite simple way to choose between the two

hypotheses. If expected inflation increases, then the value of the dollar
should fall (the exchange rate should rise) as demand for the currency

declines. On the other hand, if tight monetary policy causes the real
interest rate to rise, then a capital inflow should cause an appreciation

of the dollar. Thus, if the inflation premium view is correct, the exchange
rate should have the same positive correlation with money announcements

that the interest rate has. If the liquidity view is correct, the exchange
rate should have the opposite correlation with the other variables.3
Section 2 of this paper formalizes the intuitive argument that the

4

exchange rate depends on the expected future path of the money supply. The
model is a generalization of Frankel's (1979) synthesis of Jacob Frenkel's (1976)

monetarist version and Rudiger Dornbusch's (1976) Keynesian version, of the

monetary approach to exchange rate determination. The reader familiar with
this literature, or willing to accept the intuitive argument, is strongly
encouraged to skip directly to the empirical results in Section 3.

There,

it is discovered that the evidence strongly favors the liquidity effect.

2. A model of the exchange rate's dependence on monetary
tightness

In this section we illustrate in a particular model how the exchange
rate jumps in response to changes in the general perceived future path of

monetary policy. Thus in the case where announcements of unexpectedly large
money supplies are interpreted as increases in the Fed's target money growth

rate, the exchange rate increases. In the case where such announcements are
interpreted as transitory deviations bringing future contraction, the exchange rate falls.

We begin with a conventional money demand equation

(1)

—

Pt

=

— Ai +

a

Here m and p are the logs of the money supply and price level, i is
the very short—term interest rate and. a represents the influence of real
income and other exogenous shifts in money demand.

In a flexible—price monetarist world, the combination of purchasing
power parity in rate—of—change form and interest rate parity (equation (6)
below) would tie the domestic interest rate to the foreign interest rate,

with an allowance for expected inflation. Then the domestic price level Pt

5

would be determined by the money demand equation (1) and a money supply
process.

We are going to allow prices to be sticky, to be prevented from jumping

at a moment in time. Thus purchasing power parity does not hold in the
short run. But prices adjust to excess demand over time, so purchasing
power parity does hold in long—run equilibrium:

(2)

s=p,

where s is the log of the equilibrium spot exchange rate,

is the log

of the domestic equilibrium price level, and the log of the foreign equilib-

rium price level is taken as exogenous and is here normalized at zero. The
domestic equilibrium price level is in turn defined by the stable ("no
bubble") rational expectations solution to
—

where Et+i —

_X[E+i
is

—

+ i*] + a

the aquilibrium inflation rate expected at time t

and i is the foreign interest rate, also taken to be exogenous. This is
a logical way to determine p , because it is the way we would determine p
in a flexible—price world.

We find the rational expectations solution as follows. Solve equation

(3) for Pt in terms of Et+j .
in terms of Etpt+2 .

(4)

=

T=O

Then substitute the solution for

Continuing to substitute recursively, we obtain

()T E(m+ — a+T)

+ Xi*

We see that p is an indicator of how expansionary the entire future path
of money supply is expected to be relative to money demand. As an example,
if money supply and demand are expected to be constant at

m and a

6

respectively, then p is simply m —

possibilities under (4).

,

the spot rate s is of course

expected to increase at the rate of the equilibrium spot rate s ,

which will

be the same as the rates of increase of the equilibrium price level (by pur-

chasing power parity) and money supply (by money demand homogeneity). But
in the short run, if the spot rate exceeds what the market considers its

equilibrium path (s — s < 0) , then the currency is thought to be "undervalued," and is expected in the future to appreciate (Es+i —

s

< 0)

relative to the equilibrium path at a rate that is proportional to the gap.
(5) is of the general form that expectations are assumed to take in Frankel

(1979) and Mussa (1977). In our appendix it is shown to be precisely the
rational form for expectations to take when the system contains an equation
specifying the price level to adjust gradually according to an excess demand
function plus a term for the equilibrium inflation path.

Our final assumption is uncovered interest partly:

the announcement of an unexpectedly

high money supply induces the public to raise its expectation of future money

supplies relative to money demand, a sudden increase in s will tell us so.
On the other hand, if the announcement induces expectation of monetary con-

traction in the near future, a sudden fall in s will tell us so.
To make these two cases more concrete we now consider two particular

alternative money supply processes. Both involve a target path for the money
supply with growth rate
(9)

m_rn1+1J

In both cases we also assume here that real money demand a follows a
random walk; to get our results (qualitatively) it is sufficient that a

be autocorrelated. (Recall that a includes real income.)
Under money supply process "A," the Fed succeeds in hitting its money
supply target even on a weekly basis, but the Fed keeps changing the target
growth rate according to a random walk:

Equation (8) is the promised result that revisions in p

equilibrium increase in the exchange rate of the same percentage, and in addi-

tion causes the current exchange rate to overshoot its equilibrium by iiXB

We could stop here. Equation (4) establishes p as an indicator of
the entire expected future path of monetary policy and equation (8)

In this case, the dollar appreciates with the announcement of an unexpectedly high money supply —— the opposite from case A.
With either money supply process A or B, the nominal rate of interest
would increase with a higher—than—anticipated money supply announcement.
However, with process A it would be the inflation premium that would rise,

while in case B the real rate would jump. (This is demonstrated formally in
the Appendix.) The two processes are distinguishable by their differing implications for exchange rate movements.

3. Empirical tests of announcement effects

The market's anticipation of the next money growth announcement is

determined not only by the most recent money supply figures, but by many

other factors as well. Any attempt to measure expected money growth by,
for example, an ARIMA model of the money supply time series, is unlikely

to be accurate. It turns out that there is a very convenient measure of
the market's opinion of what the Fed is going to announce. Money Market
Services, Inc., each week surveys sixty individuals who make predictions

of what the announcement will be. It is these survey numbers that we use as
our measure of expected money growth.

It would add to the credibility of the survey numbers if we could
show that they are unbiased predictors of the actual money supply announce-

ments. Grossman has recently shown that the Money Market Services forecasts
are unbiased for the period September 1977—September 1979. Table 1 shows
some simple tests performed on an updated time sample. The first regression is a test of whether the mean forecast error from September 1977—

The announcement of an unexpectedly high money supply in this case causes an
immediate depreciation of the dollar.

Under the alternative of money supply process "3", the Fed sticks to its
pre—set target growth rate, but the actual money supply deviates from the

target due to unintended weekly fluctuations

If we use this money supply process in equation (4), we find that the announce-

ment of a money supply 1% greater than expected reduces Pt by X/(l+X)

Intuitively, under money supply process B, the announcement is interpreted

as requiring a one—for—one contraction in the following period. It is true
that the public has discovered the money supply in the most recent period to

be higher than it had estimated. But it necessarily discovers at the same

time that money demand at is higher than it had thought. Under our assumption that at is autocorrelated, the upward shift in money demand is expected
to remain next period. But under our assumption of money supply process B,
the money supply is anticipated to shift back next period. In expression (4),
representing the expected present discounted sum of present and future credit
market conditions, expected money supply has fallen relative to expected money

demand. This tightening in expectations of monetary policy is reflected in

a sudden fall in p .

announcement effect. However, we will certainly not get a perfect fit;

other factors will contribute to the changes. The question is whether the
errors that do intervene in the relationship are independent of the monetary

forecast errors. There is an excellent reason to believe that they are:
both the announced money supply figures and their forecasts as measured by
Money Market Services are predetermined, by several days, at the time that the

announcement is made. A claim of econometric exogeneity on the part of the
monetary forecast error can be supported by a Granger causality test. A
necessary condition for monetary forecast errors to be exogenous with respect
to a particular variable is that, after taking account of the information in the

lagged forecast errors, the variable in question does not help predict the

forecast error. Table 3 shows that neither the interest rate nor the exchange rate Granger—causes the monetary forecast error.
Having confirmed the desirable properties of the monetary forecasts,

we now proceed to the main results of the paper. Table 4 attempts to
confirm the empirical regularity on which the paper is predicated: the
positive dependence of interest rate changes on monetary announcements.
The interest rate is the one—month Eurodollar rate, and we look at the
change from 10 a.rn. on the day of the announcement (which is made at 4 p.m.)

to 10 a.m. the following day. The sample period is restricted to October

1979 to August 1981. The coefficient in the regressions is positive, and,
when estimated by Cochrane—Orcutt, is significant at the 90% level. Somewhat stronger results were obtained by Grossman using Treasury bill rates
that were recorded at 3:30 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. on announcement days.
Table 5 presents the regression of the change in (the log of) the

dollar/mark exchange rate between 12:00 noon the day of the announcement
and 12:00 noon the following day, against the monetary announcement fore—

11

August 1981 was different from zero. The next two equations test for
information in lagged forecast errors.7 In no case is any coefficient significantly different from zero, supporting the unbiasedness of the forecasts.
The money forecasts are actually made on Tuesdays, while money supply
figures were released usually on Thursdays until February 1980, and usually

on Fridays after then. Ideally, we would like to know the market's guess
at the money supply immediately before the announcement. Money Market
Services, Inc., believes that little new information comes in between

Tuesday and Friday to change market opinions. The previous week's money
supply figures have already been released and digested, and most other rele-

vant information, such as observed interest rate changes, should have come

in the week that the change in the money supply actually occurred. To
test this claim, it is possible to check whether the exchange rate or the
interest rate on the morning of the announcement contairs any information

that would improve the prediction. Table 2 reports regressions of the
forecast error on various combinations of the exchange rate and the interest rates, and lagged values of those two variables and the forecast

error. F—statistics indicate an inability to reject the null hypothesis
that all coefficients including the constant are zero. Thus, these guesses
at the soon—to—be—revealed money stock numbers are efficient with respect
to some obvious potential sources of information.8
Before we examine the effect of monetary.announcements (in excess of
their forecasted values) on interest rate and exchange rate changes, we
should pause to consider why we are treating the monetary forecast errors

as the independent variable. If our observations of the financial variables are taken close enough in time, before and after, to the announcement, then we can hope that the changes are explained largely by the

14

supplies, real income levels, interest rates and inflation rates. A significant negative coefficient on the interest rate indicates a rejection

of perfectly flexible prices (e.g., Frankel (1979)). One difficulty with
this approach is that there are serious simultaneity problems with considering the interest rate and expected inflation rate as independent

variables. And instrumental variable techniques are only partial solutions
because it is hard to find exogenous variables.

(A second difficulty is

that the results have proven to be sensitive to the particular currency
and sample period chosen.)

The results in Tables 4 and 5, when taken together, provide evidence
against the flexible—price view in a context free from simultaneity prob—

lems. Given just the positive correlation of monetary announcements and
interest rate changes, one could rationalize the flexible—price model by
arguing that unanticipated money growth raises expected future money

growth and thus raises expected inflation. Given just the negative correlation of monetary announcements and exchange rate changes, one could
rationalize the flexible—price model by arguing instead that unanticipated money growth generates the expectation of future contraction, thus

reducing the expected inflation. But the two results taken together can
only be explained by granting a role to sticky prices and to fluctuations

in the real interest rate. Once again: the money growth announcement
causes the real interest rate to rise, which xplains both the rise in
the nominal interest rate and the fall in the exchange rate.

13

cast error. The coefficient turns out to be negative, and highly significant.
So, on days when the money supply figures turn out to be greater than ex-

pected, the currency appreciates. This indicates that the real interest
rate rises: the nominal interest rate rises because of liquidity effects,
not because of the expected inflation premium.

4. Conclusion

The announcement phenomenon is a valuable tool for cutting through
the web of simultaneous causality that plagues much of empirical macro-

economics. The negative effect that the announcements have on the exchange
rate indicates that the market believes that the Fed has been following a

steady money growth policy, at least since October 1979. When the money
supply grows more rapidly than had been expected, the market assumes that
the Fed will reverse the error in the future, not that it has raised its

money growth target. The expectation of future tightening causes the
interest rate to rise and the exchange rate to fall.

The results of this paper also shed light on a second issue. It is
sometimes claimed that goods prices are flexible, and that fluctuations
in the interest rate mostly consist of fluctuations in the expected inflation rate, rather than the fluctuations in the real interest rate that
characterize a Keynesian model.1° In terms

Section

of the model developed in

2, the speed of adjustment O is th6ught to be close to infinite.

Changes in the nominal money supply or expected inflation rate are reflected immediately in the price level and real money supply, and thus have

no effect on the real interest rate. One way people have tested this view
of the world is to run a regression of the exchange rate against money

A possible alternative solution to the problem is to abandon the requirement that the money demand equation hold exactly in the short run and
to model explicitly the money multiplier process as a simultaneous equation

in in

, the

current i

,

and the i's expected to prevail later in the

week or month. Banks react to a monetary announcement by expecting, e.g.,
contraction and a higher Fed funds rate later in the week, and thus by
raising their demand for reserves today, raising the Fed funds rate (and

lowering in

)

today.

The fact that banks are allowed to average their

reserve holdings out over the week to meet reserve requirements explains why
they would drive today's Fed funds rate up to the level expected to prevail

later in the week. We are indebted to Dale Henderson for the banking story.

prices are sticky, interest rates are observable, and the money demand equation (1) holds.

Presumably the market has already used changes in the interest rate observed during the week to estimate money supply less money demand, with the

breakdown (as to how much each is stimated to have changed) depending ra—

1. The positive effect of unanticipated money announcements on interest
rate changes has also been documented recently by William Conrad (1981),
who uses an ARIMA process to measure expected money growth, and J. Grossman

(1981), who uses the same survey numbers that we do. More recently, it has
also been documented by Vance Roley (1982), Thomas Urich and Paul Wachtel
(1981), Urich (1982), Bradford Cornell (1982a), and Gikas Hardouvelis (1982).

2. This explanation is developed theoretically by Donald Nichols and David
Small (1982), as well as by many of the empirical papers listed in footnote 1.
3.

The first version of this paper appeared January 4, 1982. Since then,

Bradford Cornell (1982b) has written a very similar paper.

4. One might legitimately ask how we hope to explain announcement effects
on the interest rate if it is tied down by the money demand equation. The

rationalization we are using here is that the interest rate i that gives
us instantaneous money market equilibrium is a very short—term interest
rate ——

shorter—term than the one—month short—term interest rate represented

by our data. An announcement that raised or lowered expected future money

growth could raise or lower the value that I is expected to have later in
the month (when p has had time to adjust fractionally), and thus raise or
lower today's one—month rate, without changing today's i .

The disadvan-

tage with this rationalization is that announcement effects are in fact
observed for interest rates with a term as short as one day, e.g. the Fed
funds rate.

tion to do so. Thus it seems appropriate to consider the post—October
period alone.

10. For example, Fama (1975) and Frenkel (1981). Of course there already
exists other evidence against the Fama view. See, for example, Nelson and
Schwert (1977).

11. In other words, our expectation equation (5) is of the form that is
rational in a system that includes a price—adjustment equation of the Mussa

form. An alternative way of showing this would be to begin with a price—
adjustment equation of the Mussa type and derive the rational expectations

solution. This is how Engel (1981) proceeds.

tionally on the relative variance of the two. Still, the market gains a lot

of information when the true money supply is announced. When it does, the
revisions in its estimates of money supply and money demand must be equal.

7. The forecast error is the log of the actual announced money supply minus
the log of the predicted money supply. Actually, Money Market Services, Inc.,

supplied predicted changes in the money supply. These figures were added to
the current revised figures for the previous week, reported in the Federal
Reserve Bulletin, to get the predicted money supply.

8. In light of our finding that the survey data appear to be unbiased predictors of the actual money supply figures, one might be tempted to assume
rationality of expectations, and to examine the actual money supply process

directly. For example Pierce (1981) has found that the purely transitory
component is responsible for a standard deviation of

$3.3 billion in the

weekly money supply figures. However, the existence of transitory deviations
in the money supply is not sufficient to imply the announcement effect on

interest races. We would also need positive autocorrelation in money demand
innovations, as in the model of section 2 (or in the banking system innova-

tions, as in footnote 2). Simultaneous estimation of money supply and demand
equations might answer the question, but the technique used here is cleaner
and easier.

9. The Federal Reserve Board changed its operating procedure on October 6,
1979, abandoning the use of interest rates as- a guide to intervention in

money markets. The aim of this policy change, of course, was to enable it
to hit its money growth targets in the future, an aim that it had often
failed to achieve in the past, and to convince the market of its determina—
