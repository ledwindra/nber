Time Preference and International Lending and Borrowing
in an Overlapping Generations Model
ABSTRACT
Two economies, each represented by a Diamond-type overlapping generations
model, are joined together.
autarky and openness.

Capital formation and welfare are compared under

Most of the analysis concentrates on the case where

the two countries only differ in their pure rates of time preference.

The

following propositions are established:
1.

If the rate of population growth is positive, the country with the higher
value of consumption while young has a current account deficit in the
steady state.

2.

The country with the higher pure rate of time preference has a steadystate current account deficit.

3.

If the model is stable, the common open economy steady-state capital-labor
ratio lies between the two autarky capital-labor ratios'.

4.

Outside the steady state, the country with the higher pure rate of time
preference will not necessarily be the one to run a current account deficit.

5.

The welfare of the old generation alive when the two autarkic countries join
in open economy is unaffected by this international economic integration.
The welfare of the young generation in the country with the high pure rate
of time preference is lower under openness than under autarky, while in the
country with the low pure rate of time preference it is higher.

6.

The stationary utility level of the country with the high pure rate of time
preference is always higher under openness than under autarky.

The effect

of openness on the stationary utility level of the low pure rate of time
preference country is ambiguous.

If it is higher, openness can be said to

constitute a potentially pareto-superior regime for the low pure rate of
time preference country.

Because of the short-run welfare l~~s it incurs

after international economic integration, the open economy is not paretosuperior to the closed economy for the high pure rate of time preference
country.

Time Preference and International Lending and Borrowing
in an Overlapping Generations Model

1.

Introduction
In its most abstract form the pure theory of international trade

demonstrates that the reason for exchange across national boundaries is
the same as for any kind of exchange:

gains can be realized by the con-

tracting parties that would otherwise have been unobtainable.

To isolate

the underlying determinants of these potential gains, the trading economies
are evaluated in a hypothetical autarky

or pre-trade situation.

If the

relative prices of tradeable goods differ across countries in the hypothetical autarky

situation, there is prima facie evidence of potential

gains from international comrnodityarbitrage and, to the extent that
technology and internal factor mobility permit, from reallocation of resources and specialization in production.
Differences in relative prices between countries in the absence of
trade can be attributed to six

factors:

differences in technology,

differences in factor endowments, differences in tastes, differences in
scale, differences in market structuring (monopoly, unionization of labor
markets, etc.) and differences in taxes, subsidies and other man-made
wedges between buyers' and sellers' prices.
This paper ignores all determinants of trade other than taste differences.

The particular taste parameter whose effect on the pattern

of trade will be analyzed is the pure rate of time preference.

To isolate

the contribution of this parameter, the formal model will have but one
homogeneous physical output, produced in both countries with an identical
technology.

The model is non-trivial because two commodities with identical

physical characteristics available at different points in time are distinct

-2-

economic goods.

In such a one-commodity world, international trade is

always mirrored by international lending or borrowing:

~here

can be inter-

national trade in commodities if and only if there is international lending and borrowing.

Thus the model incorporates costless international

mobility of output (consumption and real capital) and of financial capital.
Labor is assumed to be immobile between countries.

some results on the one-country overlapping generations model first developed
by Diamond [1965].

This model describes the autarky

situation of the two

Section 3 analyzes the open, integrated world eeonomy.

In a recent paper Findlay [1978] has approached the problem of international trade, time preference and interest equalization from an
"Austrian" viewpoint.

This paper can be taken as a neoclassical comple-

ment to Findlay's analysis.

Tois is certainly the case for the Cobb-Douglas production

It is e.g., quite possible for OF,

while remaining strictly concave towards the origin, to be upward-sloping
at F.

The potential inefficiency due to overaccumulation reflects

the dual role of capital in the model.

Capital serves as an input in the

production function and as the unique store of value through which private
agents can transfer resources from their productive early years into retirement.

It would indeed be surprising i f this double task could be discharged

efficiently by a single medium.
The potential inefficiency can be interpreted as an externality.

The

perceived private market rate of transformation between consumption while
young and consumption while old differs from the actual social rate of
transformation which is a function of the aggregate private saving decision.
The slope of the short run and long run perceived private transformation
locus is, from the private budget constraint (2).

The Two-Country Equilibrium
The two countries that will be linked together in an international

commodity market and an international capital market are identical in all
respects, except for the pure rate of time preference.

The home country

is assumed to have a higher rate of pure time preference than the foreign
country.

For the home country we adopt the notation developed for the

autarchic economy.

All variables associated with the foreign country are

distinguished by a bar above the relevant variable.

-17(39b)

As there is no official settlements balance, the current account surplus
(deficit) of a country is identically equal to its capital account deficit
(surplus) .
The balance of trade surplus is the excess of domestic product over
domestic absorption.

Domestic absorption is the sum of consumption and

domestic capital formation.

or
(40)

The current account surplus is the excess of national product over domestic
absorption.

National product equals domestic product plus net foreign in-

vestment income.

National wealth can, and with different pure rates of time preference will
differ from the value of the domestic capit.al stock because of -the scope
for international borrowing and lending.

There is n presumption that a

nation consisting of people with high rates of time preference will tend

-18to be a net foreign borrower.

The truth of this presumption will be in-

vestigated in what follows.

Neither the steady-state trade balance nor the steady-state current
account balance need be in equilibrium.

As regards the current account

balance this is the result of a non-zero rate of population growth and
different tastes.

If e.g., the home country is a net lender to the

rest of the world (a > k), steady-state equilibrium

r~quires

a current

account surplus sufficient to maintain the real per capita value of net
claims on the rest of the world, i.e., a surplus of n(a-k) (equation (49'».
A steady-state current account surplus will be associated with a steadystate trade balance surplus if the interest rate is less than the rate of
population growth,

wit~

a steady-state trade balance deficit otherwise

(48') .

Because the real wage and the interest rate are equalized throughout
the world economy, the present discounted value of lifetime resources and
lifetime consumption is equal for residents of both countries «45) and (46».
If and only if the two countries have identical lifetime consumption paths

Each economic agent "lives \olithin his means" i.n the sense that the present
discounted value of lifetime resources (period 1 labor income) equals the
present discounted value of lifetime consumption.

Still except when tastes

are identical or population is stationary, one country will be steadily
accumulating claims on the other.
We next establish the following three propositions about the steadystate equilibrium of the world economy.
Proposition 6:

The country whose residents have a higher value of con-

sumption when young, will run a steady-state current account deficit.

The current account surplus is n(a - k) < O.

This propo-

sition unlike the following two, does not depend on the additive1y separable
specification of the utility function.
Proposition 7:

The country with the higher pure rate of time preference

has a steady-state current account deficit.
Proof:

From Proposition 6 we know that it suffices to show that p > p

This is equiva-

each generation in the home country saves

less than the corresponding generation in the foreign country, national
saving in the home country need not be less in any given period than
national saving in the foreign country.

National saving is the sum of

saving by the young and dissaving by the old.

In the home country the

young save less hut as a consequence the old dissave less.

The home country will then

dissaving of the old will, at constant savings rates out of labor income,
not be matched by the saving of the young.

The country with the higher

savings rate out of labor income will therefore, summing over the young
and the old, be dissaving faster than the country with the lower savings
rate.

Identifying the higher savings rate with a lower pure rate of

time preference, the country with the lower pure rate of time preference
will be running a current account deficit.

In the steady state the (in general

endogenous) constant savings rate in the home country is lower than in
the foreign country and labor income grows at the natural rate of growth
n.

Outside the steady state labor income may well decline during the ad-

justment process, especially if the initial capital-labor ratio is above
the steady-state capital-labor ratio.

The adjustment process then involves

a monotonic decline in k which would hurt labor's share, especially if
the elasticity of substitution is low.

Note that it is not necessary for

the approach to the steady-state current account deficit to be monotonic.
The home country could alternate between periods of deficits and surpluses
although ultimately it will run a deficit.
Scale differences
The model can be generalized in a straightforward manner to include
scale differences.

growth in the two countries must be the same, but the scale of the two

A tangency of an

indifference curve to the new budget line necessarily corresponds to a
lower level of welfare.

Proposition 9 below states that the young genera-

tion of the home country (with the high pure ·rate of time preference) will
suffer a welfare loss as a result of integration into the world economy
while the young generation of the foreign country enjoys a welfare gain.
The argument assumes that at the time of integration, t, the capitallabor ratio of the home country is not above the capital-labor ratio of
the foreign country.

This will always be the case if either the two

countries started off from the same initial condition (Proposition 4)
or, from arbitrary initial conditions, the system had been evolving
under autarky for a sufficiently long period of time (Propositions 2, 3

The economic intui-

Under autarky the low time preference country will have

a higher real wage and a lower interest rate.

During the period that the two

countries are integrated into a world economy, the young citizens of the
low time preference country inherit a high real wage from the autarky
phase,

The interest rate at which they can transfer resources into re-

tirement is higher than under autarky, however,

There has been an out-

flow of capital from the low time preference, low interest country to the
high time preference, high interest country, and the common world rate of
interest lies between the two interest rates that would have prevailed

Long-run effects
It is not possible, except in special cases, to make unambiguous welfare comparisons by comparing steady-state utility levels--the ranking of
the stationary utility levels may not be the same as the ranking of the
utility levels achieved during the transition from one steady state to
another.

Nevertheless, the stationary utility levels achieved under

autarky and openness are of interest.

They are analyzed next.

There are

In Figure 7a the

autarky capital-labor ratios of both countries are in the inefficient
region, above the golden rule capital-labor ratio.

The autarky equi-

librium of the home country is at E~T, that of the foreign country at

The golden rule capital-labor ratio is at E*.
T

The open economy equilibrium of the home country is at E , that of the

foreign country at E .
F

T

World equilibrium is at E •
W

The open economy

capital-labor ratio is between the two closed economy capital-labor
ratios (Proposition 8).

Overaccumulation (relative to the golden rule)

is reduced in the foreign country, increased in the home country.

Be-

cause the slope of the autarky budget constraint of the hon:e country is
steeper than the slope of the open economy budget constraint, and because of the strict convexity of the indifference curves, the stationary

-31level of utility for the home country (the high pure rate of time preference country) is always strictly greater under openness than under
autarky.

This has to be balanced against the short-run losses incurred

'when the transition occurs.

In Figure 7a» these short-term losses are

reflected in the need of

home country to raise the steady-state

th~

capital-labor ratio from E~T to~.

In Figure 7a the stationary utility

level of the foreign country is less under openness than under autarky.
Since the foreign country experiences a short-run welfare gain when
the two countries are integrated into the world economy, one cannot
argue that openness makes the foreign country unambiguously worse off.
Figure 7b shows that it is possible for the stationary utility level of
the foreign country to be higher under openness than under autarky.

It decumulates from

E~T to ~ and enjoys a short-run welfare gain during the transition.

[It does not matter on which

side of the golden rule the open economy world equilibrium falls.]

In

all cases, the stationary utility level of the home country is greater
under openness.

This then has to be weighted against the short-run

losses incurred during the transition.

The foreign countr.y gains in the

short run and may have a lower (Figure 7e) or a higher (Figures 7f and 7g)
stationary level of utility.

Figure 7g illustrates the very special case

in which the world equilibrium is at the golden rule.

An important clue to these welfare comparisons is provided by the
fact that international trade and financial mobility do not expand the
consumption possibility set of the "average" world consumer under openness
beyond that available to the individual countries under autarky.

Figures 4 and 7 is the stationary, decentralized consumption possibility
locus for each of the countries under autarky and for the integrated
world economy.

The same applies in the short run:

The only difference that

openness makes is that a world-wide capital market is substituted for
two national capital markets.

The equilibrium in this world-wide capital

market will be an average of the two autarky equilibria in the national
capital markets.

Conclusion
Diamond I S overlapping generat:!.ons model is extended to a two-country

world.

A number of results are obtained.

consu~e

more in the first period of their. lives (at a given wage rate

lbe country whose residents

and interest rate) has a steady-state current account deficit if the rate

of population growth is positive.

The country with the higher pure rate

-33of time preference has a steady-state current account deficit.

The

common stationary open economy capitcl-Iabor ratio lies between the two
autarky capital-labor ratios, with t.he lower

autarky capitnl-1abor ratio

associated with the country whose residents have the higher pure rate of
time preference.

Outside the steady

state~

the country with the higher

pure rate of time preference will not necessarily be the oae to run a
current account deficit.

The welfare of the old generation alive when the

two autarkic countries join in open economy is unaffected by this international econOmic integration.

The welfare of the young generation in the

country with the high pure rate of time preference is lower under openness
than· under autarky, while in the country with the low pure rate of time
preference it is higher.

The stationary utility level of the country with

the high pure rate of time preference is always higher under openness than
under autarky.

The effect of openness on the stati.onary utility level of

the low pure rate of time preference country is ambiguous.

If it is higher,

openness can be said to constitute a potentially pareto-superior regime for
the low pure rate of time preference country.

Because of the short-run

welfare loss it incurs after international economic integration, the open
economy is not pareto-superior to the closed economy for the high pure
rate of time preference country.
The open economy version of the overlapping generations model can be
extended in a number of directions.

Within the context of the one-commodity

model, budgetary and financial policy can be studied; this includes public
sector lending and
security, etc.

The two-commodity structure permits the analysis of

tariffs, quotas and other trade policies, familiar from the static
Heckscher-Ohlin model, in addition to the financial and budgetary policies
that can be studied in the one-commodity overlapping generations model.
Finally, uncertainty can be introduced into the model--most easily into
the two-commodity version.

Without futures markets for commodities, house-'

holds have to make labor supply and saving decisions while young, wi.thout
knowing the future spot prices of commodities with certainty.
