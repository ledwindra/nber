The Effect of Vietnam-Era Conscription and Genetic Potential for Educational Attainment
on Schooling Outcomes

JEL No. I20,I24,I26,J01
ABSTRACT
This study examines whether draft-lottery estimates of the causal effect of Vietnam-era military
service on schooling vary by genetic propensity toward educational attainment. To capture the
complex genetic architecture that underlies the bio-developmental pathways behavioral traits and
evoked environments associated with educational attainment, we construct a polygenic score
(PGS) for the Vietnam-era cohort in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) that aggregates
thousands of individual loci across the human genome, weighted by effect sizes derived from a
recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) for years of education. Our findings suggest
veterans with below average PGSs for educational attainment completed fewer years of schooling
than comparable non-veterans with the same PGS, primarily due to fewer years of college
education. On the other hand, we do not find any difference in the educational attainment of
veterans and non-veterans with above average PGSs. Results show that public policies and
exogenous environments may induce heterogeneous treatment effects by genetic disposition.

Introduction

The Vietnam-era draft was a pivotal moment in the lives of thousands of young men who
were called to service. Whether they were deployed to Vietnam or served outside the theater of
war, past work has suggested the existence of the draft had a profound impact on the subsequent
lives of a generation of men. As Vietnam-era veterans enter their sixties, attention has turned to
identifying the lingering effects of military service on the well-being of those who were directly
affected. While several studies have used the draft lotteries to evaluate the causal impact of
military service on a variety of physical and socioeconomic outcomes, this study is the first to
examine whether the educational attainment of conscripts was moderated by genetic influences.
To capture the complex genetic architecture that underlies the bio-developmental
pathways, behavioral traits and evoked environments associated with educational attainment, we
incorporate the latest approaches from population genetics into a quasi-natural experimental
framework to properly identify the independent and joint effects of compulsory military service
and genotype on educational outcomes. Specifically, we interact a polygenic score (PGS) for
educational attainment with instrumented veteran status in an instrumental variables (IV)
framework using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Our genotype measure
exploits findings from a recent large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of
educational attainment to construct a PGS scalar that predicts over 14 percent of the variation in
years of schooling in our analytic sample (Okbay et al., 2016). Until recently, research on
whether genotype-by-environment (G × E) interactions shape an individual’s educational path
has been hindered by the availability of a measure that could capture the multi-faceted and
complex genetic architecture of educational attainment. The addition of a comprehensive
genetic measure for educational attainment into the analysis provides a window into
2

understanding how environmental risks can have lasting effects on the realization of underlying
genetic potential.
Importantly, in this study we use an exogenous source of environmental variation in
military service—the Vietnam-era draft lotteries—to test for G × E interactions between our
PGS for educational attainment and military service. The vast majority of G × E studies in the
social, behavioral, and epidemiological sciences are often unable to support causal inference
because researchers use endogenous measures of environmental risk or fail to adequately address
population stratification—i.e. the nonrandom distribution of genes across environments due to
ancestral linkages—confounding estimates (Conley, 2009; Fletcher & Conley, 2013; Schmitz &
Conley, 2015). In particular, since selection into the military is far from random, and likely to be
correlated with factors like socioeconomic background or prior health status, it would be
impossible to sort out the effects of military service from other underlying environmental or
genetic effects in a model that uses self-reports of veteran status. By exploiting natural variation
in exposure to military service together with a comprehensive measure of genotype and controls
for population stratification, this study is better equipped to inform policy recommendations that
seek to address the emergence and development of social inequality over the life course.
Our findings suggest conscription reduced the educational attainment of veterans with
below average PGSs. Veterans with a PGS one to two standard deviations below the mean
completed approximately three fewer years of schooling and were 70.7 to 90.6 percent less likely
to obtain a postsecondary degree than non-veterans with similar PGSs. On the other hand, we do
not find any difference in the educational attainment of veterans and non-veterans with above
average PGSs, perhaps because these veterans were more likely to take advantage of generous
GI Bill benefits that were available to returning servicemen in the 1970s. Of note, similar to

3

prior draft lottery studies that were unable to uncover any lasting evidence of earnings penalties
or reductions in employment from conscription (e.g. Angrist, 1990; Angrist & Chen, 2011;
Angrist, Chen, & Frandsen, 2010; Angrist, Chen, & Song, 2011), we do not detect any
heterogeneous treatment effects by genotype on the labor market outcomes (i.e. earnings, wages,
and employment status) of Vietnam-era veterans in their fifties. Therefore, in this study we focus
exclusively on disparities in schooling outcomes.3
The remainder of the study is outlined as follows. After reviewing the relevant literature
on the genetics of educational achievement and the socioeconomic consequences of military
service in Section II, we present an in-depth explanation of the data, construction of the PGS,
and the empirical model in Section III. Finally, Section IV gives a detailed explanation of our
results, and Section V concludes.

Background

II.A.

The Genetics of Educational Attainment
Twin and family studies have linked a range of behavioral, social, and economic

outcomes to genetic differences (Beauchamp et al., 2011; Benjamin et al., 2012; Cesarini et al.,
2009). Recent studies suggest the heritability of educational attainment—or the proportion of
observed differences in education that can be attributed to genetic differences in a particular
population—ranges from around 25 to 40 percent (Branigan, McCallum, & Freese, 2013;
Lucchini, Della Bella, & Pisati, 2013; Nielsen & Roos, 2011). The variation in realized
phenotypic or observed outcomes between populations that can be ascribed to genetic differences

G × E results of conscription and education genotype on earnings, wages, and employment are available
from the authors upon request.

4

is in large part regulated by environmental influences or G × E interactions. However, without a
direct measure of genotype, extant research cannot assess the degree to which social and genetic
inheritances mediate or moderate each other’s influence (Conley et al., 2015).
Finding adequate measures for endowment at conception or birth has long been of
interest to social scientists that recognized innate, unmeasured biological variation could be
biasing models that seek to isolate the causal effect of schooling on human capital development
(for a review see Card, 1999; Card, 1995). However, pinpointing an exact measure has proven
difficult because educational attainment is a complex behavioral trait that is moderately
correlated with a host of heritable characteristics, including cognitive function (Deary et al.
2007), and personality traits such as persistence and self-discipline (Heckman & Rubinstein,
2001). Discussions of “ability bias” in the estimated return to education literature have focused
primarily on cognitive ability and have used measures of IQ or scores on other cognitive tests
like the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT) to proxy missing ability (Blackburn & Neumark,
1993; Griliches & Mason, 1972). Similarly, finding a single measure for non-cognitive skills has
proven difficult if not impossible given the diversity of traits like personality or self-esteem that
predict educational attainment. In addition, both cognitive and non-cognitive measures are
affected by the social environment, which calls into question the pretreatment character of these
assessments at any point in time.
To circumvent endogeneity issues, studies have used twin or family models, or measures
of family background as controls or instruments (for an overview see Griliches, 1979).
However, without a direct measure of genotype, it is often unclear what these measures are
capturing. For example, twin and adoptee family studies on socioeconomic success cannot rule
out the possibility that presumed genetic differences between biological and adopted children are

5

actually proxying unmeasured environmental influences like the birth mother’s uterine
environment, which has been shown to exert a strong influence on life chances (Almond, Chay,
& Lee, 2005; Almond & Mazumder, 2011; Black, Devereux, & Salvanes, 2007; Conley &
Bennett, 2000).
Recently, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of educational
attainment have identified 74 genome-wide significant loci (𝑝 < 5 × 10−8 ), or single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), associated with number of years of schooling completed (Okbay et al.,
2016; Rietveld et al., 2013). The GWAS findings implicated SNPs in regions that regulate brainspecific gene expression in neural tissue or genotype-tissue expression in the central nervous
system (Okbay et al. 2016, p. 540). In addition, results implicate candidate genes and biological
pathways that are active during distinct stages of prenatal development. Taken together, the
linear polygenic score or joint predictive power of all SNPs from the most recent GWAS
explains approximately 3.2 percent of the variation in years of schooling across all participating
cohorts in the GWAS meta-analysis (p. 541). These studies have opened up new opportunities
for researchers who seek to measure latent biological traits that may be biasing traditional
models of socioeconomic attainment.
It is important that a PGS for educational attainment not be misinterpreted as “the gene
for ability.” If anything, the small amount of variation in educational attainment predicted by the
PGS emphasizes the importance of environmental intervention. For example, a meta-analysis of
twin studies found that genetic influences on educational attainment diverge considerably across
countries and birth cohorts (Branigan et al., 2013). With this in mind, using a PGS for
educational attainment has several attractive features for the detection and estimation of G × E
relationships. First, complex behavioral outcomes or behaviors of interest to social scientists like

6

educational attainment are usually highly polygenic, or reflect the influence or aggregate effect
of many different genes (Visscher, Hill, & Wray, 2008). Second, individual genetic loci
influencing the etiology of complex phenotypes have low penetrance; no single gene produces a
symptom or trait at a detectable level, making it difficult to distinguish between environmental
and genetic factors (Ibid.). Thus, interacting a PGS for educational attainment with a plausibly
exogenous environmental shock allows us to detect possible G × E interactions where the
biological mechanisms are not yet fully understood (Belsky & Israel, 2014). This is particularly
important for the aim of the present study, which seeks to identify whether genetic influences
moderated the educational attainment of conscripts nearly 40 years after the Vietnam War.

II.B.

Conscription and Post-Service Socioeconomic Attainment
The effects of compulsory military service on post-service schooling, earnings, and

employment have been largely attributed to two central yet countervailing factors in the
literature. On the one hand, conscription may act as an implicit tax on the lifetime education and
earnings of soldiers who were coerced into service, paid poorly, and lost valuable labor market
experience as a result of their time spent in service (Mason, 1970; Oi, 1967). The two or more
years spent on active duty in military service may interrupt or impede career progress, and the
training and skills acquired in the military may be of little value to civilian employers or may not
be easily transferrable to the civilian sector (Wool, 1968). On the other hand, military service
may enhance human capital development through its constellation of job training and support
services that are available during and after service.
In particular, there has been a large body of literature that has focused on the long-term
effects of the World War II, Korean, and Vietnam-era GI Bills, which among other benefits,

7

provided cash payments for university or vocational tuition expenses.4 Along these lines, studies
have found the GI Bill increased the postsecondary educational attainment of World War II
(Bound & Turner, 2002; Lemieux & Card, 2001), Korean War (Stanley, 2003), and Vietnam
War veterans (Angrist, 1993; Angrist & Chen, 2011) above that of their non-veteran peers.
Estimates are surprisingly comparable across studies and indicate benefits from the GI Bill
increased college completion by five to six percentage points and years of college by 0.20-0.33
years. However, these studies are only able to estimate the local average treatment effect
(LATE) of the draft on educational attainment, and are therefore unable to observe whether
conscription had heterogeneous treatment effects across the genetic distribution.5
Conversely, earnings and employment estimates seem to vary considerably across
cohorts and over time. Earlier research finds Vietnam-era veterans tended to be worse off than
comparable non-veterans and veterans from the WWII and Korean Wars in terms of income,
employment, and job prestige (Card, 1983; Rothbart, Sloan, & Joyce, 1981; Schwartz, 1986).
For example, Schwartz (1986) compares the earnings of Vietnam and Korean veterans twelve to
sixteen years after their discharge and finds the rate of return per year of education was
significantly lower for Vietnam veterans than Korean veterans, who were economically
indistinguishable from their non-veteran contemporaries. Similarly, cross-sectional comparisons
show WWII veterans had higher earnings than comparable non-veterans (Berger & Hirsch, 1983;

4

The WWII GI Bill included a $500 tuition supplement and a monthly stipend and was similar to
Vietnam-era benefits in the 1970s (adjusting for inflation); benefits were almost double the average cost
of tuition, room, and board at a four-year public university during this time period (Angrist & Chen,
2011; Bound & Turner, 2002).
5

We also estimate the main (instrumented) effect of veteran status in our Vietnam sample and find no
LATE of veteran status on schooling. Our estimates most likely diverge from past work because of the
considerably smaller sample size of draft eligible men in the HRS compared to studies that have used the
2000 Census (i.e. Angrist and Chen 2011), making it difficult to detect a LATE that is small in
magnitude. Table is available from the authors upon request.

8

Rosen & Taubman, 1982), though this premium disappears and WWII veterans actually appear
to have earned less than comparable non-veterans when nonrandom selection into the military is
accounted for using instrumental variable methods (Angrist & Krueger, 1994).
Results from more recent studies that use the Vietnam-era draft lottery as an instrument
for veteran status find the large earnings losses in in the 1970s and 1980s disappear and rapidly
converge to zero in the 1990s, or when veterans were approximately 50 years of age (Angrist,
1990; Angrist et al., 2011). Using data from the 2000 Census, Angrist and Chen (2011)
reconcile these earnings results by combining earnings estimates with estimated GI Bill effects in
a Mincer-style wage equation, and confirm that the near-zero wage penalty at older ages is due to
both the flattening of the age-earnings profile in middle-age and economic returns to schooling
funded by the GI Bill, which appears to have roughly offset any modest earnings losses due to
service. However, the authors point out that lifetime earnings losses to Vietnam veterans have
still been negative overall; after accounting for GI Bill benefits, they calculate the present value
of lost earnings at around 10 percent of total earnings through the year 2000 (Ibid., p. 116).
Finally, studies that use the Vietnam-era draft lotteries have not been able to uncover any
evidence of lasting changes in employment rates or labor force participation at older ages
(Angrist & Chen, 2011; Angrist et al., 2010). Similar to these studies, we find little evidence that
genetic differences moderated the impact of conscription on the labor market outcomes of
Vietnam-era veterans.

Data and Methodology

III.A. The Health and Retirement Study
The HRS is a nationally representative, longitudinal panel study of individuals over the
age of 50 and their spouses. Launched in 1992, the study was designed to paint a detailed
portrait of the labor force participation and health transitions individuals undergo towards the
end of their work lives and into retirement; comprehensive information about participants’
socioeconomic background, income, assets, employment, and veteran status is collected
alongside genetic data. The HRS introduces a new cohort of participants every six years and
interviews around 20,000 participants every two years. For the purposes of this study, we link
the Genotype Data Version 1 (2006 and 2008 samples) of the HRS genetic data to both the
RAND HRS Data files for socio-demographic information and the restricted Respondent Date of
Birth Files (1992-2010) to code for draft eligibility.6
The majority of men who were draft eligible during the Vietnam Era entered the HRS in
2004 as part of the “Early Baby Boomer” cohort—a nationally representative sample of men and
women born between 1948 and 1953. However, to maximize sample size, we also include
spouses of female respondents from former cohorts that were born between 1948 and 1952.
Since we use findings from a GWAS conducted on individuals of European ancestry to construct
our PGS, our sample excludes respondents who report being of Hispanic, African, American
Indian, Alaskan Native, Asian, or Pacific Islander ethnic origin (Carlson et al., 2013). Our final
analytic sample includes 504 white, non-Hispanic men born between 1948 and 1952 who
provided DNA samples in 2006 or 2008.
6

The RAND HRS Data (Version O, 2015) is an easy to use longitudinal data set based on the HRS data.
It was developed at RAND with funding from the National Institute on Aging and the Social Security
Administration, Santa Monica.

10

III.B. Draft Eligibility
Between 1969 and 1972 the U.S. Selective Service held four Vietnam-era draft lotteries.
The first lottery, held in December 1969, affected men born between 1944-1950 who were at risk
of conscription in 1970, while subsequent draft lotteries held in 1970 and 1971 affected men who
were 19 years old only, or who were born in 1951 or 1952, and at risk of conscription in 1971 or
1972, respectively. A final lottery was held in 1972 for men born in 1953, but no draft calls were
issued in 1973. For each lottery, individual birthdates (including February 29th) were placed in a
blue capsule, and then independently drawn until each day of the year was paired with a random
sequencing number (RSN) between 1 and 366. After needs for manpower were determined, a
draft-eligibility ceiling or cutoff was assigned to each lottery. Men with RSNs below the cutoff
were considered draft eligible, while men with RSNs above the cutoff were exempt from the
draft. Draft eligibility ceilings were pegged at 195, 125, and 95 for the 1969, 1970, and 1971
lotteries, respectively (see Table 1). Based on these eligibility cutoffs, we follow prior studies
and code draft eligibility as equal to “1” if the respondent’s RSN was called in the corresponding
draft year and “0” otherwise.7

Due to the high number of men who volunteered for the military or received educational
deferments before the first draft lottery, studies that use the draft lottery as a natural experiment
typically exclude men born between 1944 and 1949 since the link between draft eligibility and
veteran status is far from deterministic in these earlier birth cohorts (Angrist, 1990). To
determine the probability of service by birth cohort, we follow Dobkin and Shabani (2009) and
regress veteran status on draft eligibility and a constant with controls for month of birth for the
1948-1949 and 1950-1952 HRS genotyped cohorts. We find that draft eligible men born
between 1948 and 1949 were 18.4 percentage points more likely to serve whereas draft eligible
veterans born between 1950 and 1952 were 16.4 percentage points more likely to serve. Thus,
due to the similarity of the estimates, the analysis includes men of European ancestry born
between 1948 and 1952 to maximize the power of the study.

III.C. Schooling Outcomes
The HRS asks respondents their highest grade of school or year of college completed. If
the respondent reports 12 or fewer years of school, they are asked whether they obtained a high
school diploma or passed a high school equivalency test (GED). If the respondent reports 13 or
more years of school, they are asked whether or not they obtained a college degree, and if so the
highest degree obtained. These responses are categorized as “less than bachelors”, “bachelors”,
“masters/MBA”, or “other” which includes the MD, JD, and PhD degrees. If the respondent
reports 13 or more years of education but does not report receiving a college degree, completion
of a high school degree is assumed, but the data do not distinguish a high school diploma from a
GED.

12

Based on these data, we analyze five schooling outcomes, including highest grade of
schooling attended (“years of education”), total years of college education (“years of college”)
and a series of dichotomous variables denoting whether a respondent completed each degree
level (“GED/HS degree +”, “associate degree +”, and “bachelor’s degree +”).8 “Years of
education” is a continuous variable that can range from “0” for no formal education to “17” for
post college education. If the respondent reports receiving at least 12 years of education, we
subtract 12 from total years of education reported to obtain “years of college”.
Degree variables with a “+” sign are cumulative, so that “GED/HS degree +” indicates
those with at least a GED/HS degree. We code these as overlapping subpopulations that
diminish from lower to higher levels of schooling so that “associate degree +” compares
respondents who received at least an associate degree with those who received a GED/HS degree
only while the “bachelor’s degree +” variable compares those who received at least a bachelor’s
degree with respondents who received an associate degree only. This allows us to assess the
impact of conscription and genotype on degree transitions, as opposed to their impact on college
attendance for all persons, which by definition would compare the cumulative impact of these
factors over all previous transitions instead of their respective impact on each degree transition
(Mare, 1980). In this way, we can observe changes in the marginal effect of genotype and
conscription on degree completion at each level of educational attainment.

III.D. Polygenic Score (PGS)
The linear PGS is calculated for the HRS sample based on results from a GWAS metaanalysis of educational attainment conducted by the Social Science Genetics Association
We follow RAND and categorize individuals who report receiving a college degree but “less than
bachelors” as receiving an “associate degree.”
8

13

Consortium (SSGAC) among people of European ancestry (Okbay et al., 2016). The PGS
aggregates thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome and weights
them by the strength of their association using beta weights derived from the GWAS to yield a
single scalar of genetic propensity for educational attainment. Or, the PGS is a weighted sum
across the number of SNPs (𝑛) of the number of reference alleles 𝑥 (zero, one, or two) at that
SNP multiplied by the effect size for that SNP (𝛽):
𝑛

(1)

𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 = ∑ 𝛽𝑗 𝑥𝑖𝑗
𝑗=1

We incorporate beta weights from the largest GWAS meta-analysis discovery sample to
date, which includes genotype data on individuals from both the UK Biobank and 23andMe in
addition to individuals from other participating studies in the SSGAC (N=395,109). Since the
HRS is part of the GWAS discovery sample, we use weights estimated by the SSGAC that
exclude the HRS sample. 9 HRS Genotype Data Version 1 (2006 and 2008 samples) were used
to construct the PGS—i.e. imputed data was not analyzed.10 A total of 1,411,964 SNPs in the
HRS genetic database overlapped or matched SNPs from the GWAS meta-analysis. All
available SNPs were used to construct the PGS using the software LDpred (Vilhjálmsson et al.,
2015).11 The PGS is standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one for the
population of white, non-Hispanic males born between 1948 and 1952.

9

The HRS contributed 9,963 individuals to the meta-analysis—i.e. the total meta-analysis discovery
sample size with the HRS included is 405,072.
10

Genotyping was performed on the HRS sample using the Illumina Human Omni-2.5 Quad beadchip
(HumanOmni2.5-4v1 array). The median call-rate for the 2006 and 2008 samples is 99.7%.
11

LDpred uses a Bayesian method to calculate PGSs that estimates posterior mean causal effect sizes
from GWAS summary statistics by assuming a prior for the genetic architecture and linkage

14

To control for confounding from population stratification, or to account for any ethnic or
racial differences in genetic structures within populations that could bias estimates, we use
principal components. The principal components measure the uncorrelated variation or
dimensions of the data, accounting for the non-random distribution of genes across populations
that could bias estimates. We calculate the principal components using second-generation
PLINK software (Purcell et al., 2007) on the entire sample of genotyped respondents, and
include the first four in our regression analysis—a dimensionality that has generally proven
adequate in the literature (Price et al., 2006).12

disequilibrium (LD) information from a reference panel. This method has been shown to increase the
predictive accuracy of PGSs because it does not discard informative markers that may increase
heritability estimates and also accounts for the effects of linked markers that can lead to biased estimates,
unlike other methods that use pruning or clumping to deal with LD (Vilhjálmsson et al. 2015). The PGS
is constructed in LDpred using an LD window of 180 and fraction of causal SNPs assumed to be 1.

We also ran the analysis with the first 10 principal components and did not find any significant

The score is predictive of all education phenotypes in base, non-interactive main effect
models for both the entire sample of white, non-Hispanic genotyped males and in our sample of
white, non-Hispanic men born between 1948 and 1952 (see Table 2). The score explains 5.5
percent of the variation in years of education for all white, non-Hispanic males and 14.2 percent
of the variation in the Vietnam sample. The higher explanatory power of the score in the
Vietnam cohort could in part be due to higher college completion rates among men with above
average PGSs who took advantage of GI Bill services. To explore this further, Table 3 reports
results from regressions that test the correlation between the PGS and schooling outcomes in the
sample of draft eligible and ineligible men.

The score has more prediction power in the draft eligible sample for years of education
and years of college completion; however, it is not correlated with completion of a GED or high
school degree in draft eligible men. This makes sense given that the majority of men graduated

16

high school before they were exposed to the draft, or when they were at least 19 years of age. In
addition, veterans who were scheduled to graduate and left high school prematurely to serve in
the war were eligible to receive a GED during service, and since the 1990s, many states have
also developed programs to grant high school diplomas to qualifying Vietnam-era veterans
(Angrist & Chen, 2011). In other words, we do not find preliminary evidence of a G × E effect
from conscription on high school completion.

Years of Education PGS Decile

Conversely, the correlation and predictive power of the PGS is higher in the draft eligible
sample of men who obtained at least an associate degree, indicating that draft eligible men with
higher PGSs were more likely to obtain an associate degree than draft ineligible men. The
steeper increase in educational attainment in the top half of the PGS distribution for draft eligible
men can be seen in Figure 1, which plots the average years of educational attainment by PGS

17

decile and draft eligibility. The figure shows a preliminary (negative) G × E effect in the bottom
50 percent of the PGS distribution, where draft eligible men appear to have obtained fewer years
of schooling on average than draft ineligible men. These differences more or less converge in
the top half of the distribution, with the exception that draft eligible men in the top 30 percent
appear to have obtained slightly fewer years of schooling on average. This could in part explain
why the score is not correlated with receiving at least a bachelor’s degree in the sample of draft
eligible men—i.e. draft eligible men in the top 30 percent of the PGS distribution were less likely
to obtain a bachelor’s or advanced degree than draft ineligible men.

III.E. Descriptive Statistics
Veterans are likely to have different educational backgrounds than non-veterans for two
primary reasons. First, individuals from higher socioeconomic backgrounds are less likely to
enlist in the military because they have more employment and educational opportunities.
Second, socioeconomic background aside, individuals with greater potential for educational
attainment may be more likely to pursue a postsecondary degree after high school. The first few
columns in Table 4 verify these differences. On average, non-veterans completed more years of
education (14.5) than veterans (13.7) and more years of college (2.7) than veterans (1.8).
Veterans were 18.8 percentage points more likely to have only a high school degree or GED
compared to non-veterans, and veterans who attended college were more likely to only obtain an
associate degree (0.12) compared to non-veterans (0.05). Completion of a bachelor’s degree or
advanced degree among non-veterans is nearly double that of veterans; approximately 47.6
percent of non-veterans obtained a bachelor’s or advanced degree compared to only 23.6 percent
of veterans. Our PGS for educational attainment is also 0.32 standard deviations lower in the

18

veteran sample, indicating that veterans with lower PGSs were more likely to select into military
service. These observable differences between veterans and non-veterans may lead to biased
cross-sectional estimates of the consequences of military service on schooling outcomes if there
are other systematic (unobservable) differences between the two groups that we cannot account
for.

In addition, since the HRS is a study of older adults, potential problems could arise if
conscripts who survived to be genotyped in 2006 or 2008 were more likely to be educated and
therefore have lower mortality rates than comparable populations (Domingue et al., 2016). If
increased education is an alternative pathway affecting the military conscription-mortality
relationship, draft eligibility is no longer exogenous, and the exclusion restriction on which our
2SLS estimates rest will be violated. Prior studies on selective mortality effects in the draftlottery sample have been mixed. A pioneering study by Hearst, Newman, and Hulley (1986)
found excess deaths from suicide and motor vehicle accidents among draft-eligible men from
19

California and Pennsylvania. However, more recently, Conley and Heerwig (2012) find no
effect of draft exposure on mortality, including for cause-specific death rates, in a larger sample
of national death records, and Angrist et al. (2010) find little evidence of elevated mortality
among draft-eligible men in the 2000 census. Importantly, Conley and Heerwig (2012) do find
some evidence of elevated mortality among draft-eligible, college-educated men. However, they
argue this effect works in the opposite direction of putative education-enhancing effects that
could potentially violate the exclusion restriction in IV regression models—i.e. high SES men
were not more likely to survive.
Crucially, results in the last four columns of Table 4 reveal no significant difference in
draft eligible and ineligible means by PGS, schooling outcome, or marital status, suggesting bias
from unobserved differences, mortality selection, sample attrition, or genetic screening consent is
modest if nonexistent in the draft eligible birth cohorts. In the overall, genotyped, HRS male
sample (N=3,530), year of birth is highly correlated with the PGS (see also Conley et al.,
2016)—perhaps not surprising given the well-documented association between education and
longevity (Conti, Heckman, & Urzua, 2010; Cutler & Lleras-Muney, 2010; Lleras-Muney,
2005). However, we find that the PGS is not correlated with year of birth in our Vietnam-era
analytic sample, indicating that men with above average PGSs were not more likely to survive
than men at the bottom half of the PGS distribution. The difference between the overall sample
and our analytic sample is probably due to two factors: 1) The Vietnam-draft birth cohorts are
still on the younger side of HRS respondents and thus may not have fully evinced educationalPGS associated mortality and 2) The birth year window is quite narrow within our analytic
sample. That said, adjusting for mortality bias generally does not affect cohort-PGS results in
the HRS even across the entire range of the sample (Domingue et al., 2016).

20

Finally, Table 5 compares descriptive statistics for men in our sample who were
genotyped (N=504) with same-age white, non-Hispanic men who were not genotyped (N=485).
Two sample t-tests reveal no significant differences between the means of the two groups with
the exception that men who were not genotyped are 3.07 percentage points more likely to not
have an academic degree. We also find evidence that genotyped men were more likely to be
married while they were in the HRS sample (0.87) than men who were not genotyped (0.83),
though this difference is only statistically significant at the p<.10 level.

III.F. Empirical Model
Following prior studies, we use the Vietnam-era draft lottery as an instrument for veteran
status to identify the causal effect of military service and genotype on veterans’ schooling. Since
past research has shown draft eligibility is 1) highly correlated with actual veteran status, and 2)

21

only affects educational outcomes through the first stage channel, or through its correlation with
veteran status, it is considered a valid instrument for military service.13 Consider the following
G × E interaction model:

(2)

𝑌𝑖 = 𝛼1 𝑉𝐸𝑇𝑖 + 𝛼2 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 × 𝑉𝐸𝑇𝑖 + 𝑋𝑖′ 𝛼3 + 𝜀𝑖

Where, 𝑉𝐸𝑇𝑖 is coded as “1” if individual 𝑖 reports serving in the military and “0”
otherwise, 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 is the polygenic score for educational attainment, 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 × 𝑉𝐸𝑇𝑖 is their
interaction, 𝑌𝑖 is the schooling outcome of interest, 𝑋𝑖 is a vector of exogenous controls, and 𝜀𝑖 is
the disturbance term. The 𝑉𝐸𝑇𝑖 and 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 × 𝑉𝐸𝑇𝑖 terms are treated as endogenous and the
𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 and 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 × 𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 terms are used as excluded instruments in a two-stage least squares
(2SLS) IV framework, where 𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 is coded as “1” for draft eligible men and “0” for draft
ineligible men in accordance with the draft eligibility ceilings reported in Table 1 (Schmitz &
Conley, 2016). The first-stage regressions for the G × E interaction model are as follows:

(3)

𝑉𝐸𝑇𝑖 = 𝜋1 𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 + 𝜋2 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 × 𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 + 𝑋𝑖′ 𝜋3 + 𝜂𝑖

(4)

𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 × 𝑉𝐸𝑇𝑖 = 𝛾1 𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 + 𝛾2 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 × 𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 + 𝑋𝑖′ 𝛾3 + 𝜌𝑖

13

The first condition is easy to verify, and standard first stage statistics (partial R2 and F-statistic) for the
significance of the instruments in the HRS sample show draft eligibility is a robust predictor of veteran
status (see Table 6). The exclusion restriction, or second condition, cannot directly be tested. Heckman
(1997) shows the IV estimator is not consistent if heterogeneous behavioral responses to the treatment—
or military service in this case—are correlated with the instrument (i.e. draft eligibility). However, past
research has provided convincing counterfactuals that suggest the exclusion restriction holds. For
example, Angrist (1990) found no significant relationship between earnings and draft eligibility status for
men born in 1953 (where draft eligibility was defined using the 1952 lottery cutoff of 95). Since the 1953
cohort was assigned RSNs but never called to service, if the draft affected outcomes directly, we would
expect outcomes to vary by draft eligibility for this cohort.

22

Where the model is exactly identified—i.e. the number of excluded instruments (𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 and
𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 × 𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 ) are equal to the number of endogenous regressors (𝑉𝐸𝑇𝑖 and 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 × 𝑉𝐸𝑇𝑖 ).
The vector of exogenous controls (𝑋𝑖 ) includes the main effect of the PGS, which we model as
𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 × 𝑁𝑂𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 , where 𝑁𝑂𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 is equal to “1” if individuals were not drafted and never
served in the military, and “0” otherwise. We also control for the first four principal components
to account for population stratification in the genotype data and dummies for year and month of
birth.14
Note that in a typical linear regression model with an interaction term, the interaction
term and each of the corresponding main effects are modeled as separate terms (i.e. 𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 ,
𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 × 𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 and 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 ). Here, we model the main effect of 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 as 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 × 𝑁𝑂𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 for
two reasons. First, as shown in our descriptive statistics in Table 4, 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 is an invalid instrument
because it is negatively and significantly correlated with veteran status, meaning that men with
lower PGSs were more likely to select into the military. This can also be seen in Table 6 below,
which contains first stage statistics for models where the main effect is modeled both as 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖
(Column 1) and as 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 × 𝑁𝑂𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 (Column 2). First stage estimates reveal that when the
main effect of 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 is modeled as 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 × 𝑁𝑂𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 the correlation between the main effect
and veteran status is eliminated—i.e. 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 is exogenous and no longer correlated with veteran
status in the (randomized) draft eligible and ineligible groups. Second, because we are using a
2SLS approach, and 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 is highly correlated with 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 × 𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 , modeling the main effect of
𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 as 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 × 𝑁𝑂𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 strengthens the correlation between the 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 × 𝑉𝐸𝑇𝑖 and 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 ×
14

A mechanical failure in the implementation of the first round of the lottery (balls with the days of the
year were not mixed sufficiently after having been dumped in a month at a time) resulted in a
disproportionately high probability of being drafted for those born in the last few months of the year
(Fienberg, 1971). This could bias estimates if those born later in the year differ in important ways from
those born at other times during the year. For example, studies have shown health varies with season of
birth.

23

𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 terms, which increases the precision of the first stage estimates and improves the finitesample performance of the 2SLS estimator.

Finally, we substitute the first stage equations in Table 6, Column 2 into the structural
equation to derive the reduced form in the second stage:

(5)

𝑌𝑖 = 𝛿1 𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 + 𝛿2 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 × 𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 + 𝑋𝑖′ 𝛿3 + 𝜉𝑖

For all limited and continuous dependent variables in this study, the second stage equation is
estimated with a simple linear probability model because it is the ideal specification when faced

24

with a set of simultaneous equations where the instrument, the endogenous regressor, and the
dependent variable take on a limited set of values (Angrist & Pischke, 2008).
As long as 𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 is exogenous and only affects the outcome through the first stage
channel, or through its correlation with 𝑉𝐸𝑇𝑖 , we avoid any potential confounders, and the
coefficient on 𝛿1 can be interpreted as the local average treatment effect (LATE) of military
status, or the difference in schooling outcomes between veterans and non-veterans with an
average PGS.15 Modeling the main effect of 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 as 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 × 𝑁𝑂𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 does not change the
meaning of this term, which can still be interpreted as the marginal effect of 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 on schooling
for men who were not drafted and who did not serve. However, it does change the interpretation
of δ2 , which now represents the marginal effect of 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 on schooling for draft eligible veterans
instead of the expected difference in the marginal effects between draft eligible veterans and
draft ineligible non-veterans. Therefore, when we estimate the average treatment effect of
veteran status by genotype in the “Results” section, we subtract the treatment effect for nonveterans (𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 × 𝑁𝑂𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 ) from the treatment effect for veterans (𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 + 𝑃𝐺𝑆𝑖 ×
𝐷𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑇𝑖 ) to calculate the expected difference in schooling outcomes between the two groups.

IV.

Results

Our main results are presented in Table 7, which reports the OLS and 2SLS estimates
from the G × E interaction model. The OLS estimates are remarkably comparable to the 2SLS
estimates in both magnitude and sign, although the OLS estimates tend to be slightly lower

15

The IV estimates of effects of military service using the draft lottery capture the effect of military
service on “compliers”, or men who served because they were draft eligible but who would not otherwise
have served. It is not, therefore, an estimate of the effect of military service on men who volunteered.
See Angrist and Pischke (2008) for a more detailed discussion of the interpretation of the LATE for the
Vietnam-era draft.

25

across the board. This stands in stark contrast to the schooling outcomes reported by Angrist and
Chen (2011) in the 2000 Census where OLS estimates diverged considerably from 2SLS
estimates and often displayed opposite signs. Therefore, it appears including the PGS in the
OLS model may reduce some of the confounding between educational outcomes and nonrandom
selection into the military. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that the OLS
estimates are biased downward due to other unobserved characteristics.
Pivoting to the IV estimates, we report coefficients from the causal 2SLS model in the
second column for each schooling outcome in Table 7. 2SLS estimates of “Veteran” capture the
effect of conscription on schooling at the mean value of the PGS, and the “PGS × Veteran”
coefficient captures the effect of compulsory military service at all other values of the PGS. The
“PGS × Non-Veteran” coefficient is the effect of the PGS on men who were not treated, or those
who were not drafted and who did not serve in the military. In addition, we report the average
treatment effect of veteran status, or the total difference in schooling outcomes between veterans
and non-veterans, by PGS in Table 8.16
Coefficients on the “Veteran × PGS” and “Non-Veteran × PGS” interaction terms in
Table 7 are significant and indicate higher levels of educational attainment for each standard
deviation increase in the PGS. Notably, results for highest degree obtained indicate the absence
of a veteran G × E effect for GED/HS completion. Again, this is not surprising given the vast
majority of veterans—regardless of genotype—were exposed to the draft after they completed
high school.

16

The marginal effect of veteran status by genotype is estimated by adding the individual
treatment effects for veterans (“Veteran” + “Veteran × PGS”) and subtracting them from the
treatment effect for non-veterans who were not drafted (“Non-Veteran” × “PGS”) at a given
PGS value. This is done using a post-linear combination to ensure the accuracy of the standard
errors.

The G × E effect is, however, significantly stronger for veterans who completed at least
an associate degree, indicating veterans with above average PGSs were more likely to take
advantage of GI Bill benefits and complete additional schooling after the war. However, the
effect of the PGS completely disappears for non-veterans and is substantially diminished for
veterans in the population of individuals who completed a bachelor’s degree. Thus, genetic
propensity played a larger role in the completion of an associate degree after the war than in the
completion of a bachelor’s or advanced degree.

Overall, we do not find any evidence that compulsory military service and subsequent
access to GI Bill benefits increased the educational attainment of veterans above that of non-

28

veterans. Results reported in Table 8 show no difference in schooling outcomes between
veterans and non-veterans with above average PGSs, or those with a PGS one to two standard
deviations above the mean. In other words, veterans with above average PGSs reached similar
levels of schooling as their same-PGS non-veteran counterparts. Conversely, we find military
service reduced the educational attainment of veterans with below average PGSs. Model
estimates show conscripts with a PGS one standard deviation below the mean obtained 3.1 fewer
years of education and attended 2.7 fewer years of college than non-veterans with similar PGSs.
These veterans were also 70.7 to 90.6 percent less likely to obtain an associate, bachelor’s, or
advanced degree (PhD, JD, or MD).

The sizable variation in schooling by PGS can also be seen in Figure 2 above, which
plots the difference in years of schooling between veterans and non-veterans at all values of the
PGS with 95% confidence intervals. A treatment effect persists for veterans with a PGS at or
below -0.6, whereas the treatment effect at higher values of the PGS is not significant.17

V.

Discussion

Surviving Vietnam-era veterans are currently the single largest veteran population in the
United States. Over 7.2 million Vietnam veterans constitute 32.9 percent of the total veteran
population and receive the largest overall share and per veteran share of service-related disability
benefits (NCVAS, 2015)—a figure that is growing as the population ages. The annual
compensation to veterans from the Vietnam Era more than doubled between 2003 and 2012,
reaching $19.7 billion of the total paid to veterans that year of $44.4 billion (Ibid.). Given the
well-established relationship between investments in human capital and improved health,
employment opportunities, and income across the life span, a deeper understanding of whether
biological and social forces shape the educational outcomes of veterans is needed.
Contrary to the small gains in schooling found by Angrist and Chen (2011), in this study
we do not find any evidence that conscription increased the schooling of Vietnam-era veterans in
our HRS sample. Conflicting estimates are likely the byproduct of differences in power and
sample population between the 2000 Census and the HRS. However, despite a significantly
lower sample size, we find evidence that draft exposure reduced the educational attainment of
conscripts with below average PGSs for educational attainment. Draft eligible men with below
average PGSs completed approximately three fewer years of schooling and were approximately
17

We note that due to low sample sizes at higher and lower values of the PGS, IV estimates more than
two standard deviations away from the mean may not accurately predict the treatment effect.

30

70.7 to 90.6 percent less likely to obtain a postsecondary degree. On the other hand, we find no
difference in schooling outcomes between veterans and non-veterans with above average PGSs.
Taken together, this suggests that high-PGS veterans were more likely to take advantage of
generous GI Bill benefits, which paid more than double the average cost of tuition, room, and
board at a four-year public university in the 1970s.
A significant drawback of our IV estimation strategy is we cannot fully describe the
underlying theoretical relationships between military service and educational attainment that may
be driving our results. For example, we cannot disentangle the particular aspects of military
service in Vietnam—such as combat positions, year of service, or number of tours—that may be
linked to post-traumatic stress or other debilitating conditions that limited the long-term
socioeconomic attainment of veterans. In particular, assignment to the theater of war was by no
means random and studies have shown that men with lower Armed Forces Qualification Test
(AFQT) scores and fewer support role skills were more likely to be exposed to combat (e.g.
Gimbel & Booth, 1996). The data reported here are entirely consistent with higher IQ conscripts
holding safer non-combat or administrative support positions and taking disproportionate
advantage of the GI Bill after service. In other words, our IV model does not explain why
Vietnam-era service negatively affected the educational attainment of veterans with below
average PGSs.
However, despite weaker claims to external validity, the model’s high degree of internal
validity may direct practitioners to effective treatments that could increase the educational
attainment, enhancement of skills, and overall assimilation into civilian life of returning veterans.
Although we caution that the estimates from our study apply specifically to Vietnam-era
veterans, and thus cannot be generalized to the population as a whole or even to current military

31

personnel, to the extent that the Vietnam-era draft lottery serves as a proxy for stressful events in
young adulthood, or exposure to combat, policymakers may want to design interventions that
minimize the negative impact of similar traumatic events on scholastic achievement. Similarly,
in terms of future research, while we do discover some heterogeneity in treatment effects from
military service on schooling by genotype, more research is needed to identify how genetic
attributes modify the effect of military service on earnings and employment in mid-life. In
particular, studies that can track veterans across the entire life course would lend insight into
whether intervention during sensitive time periods can reduce long-term disparities in
socioeconomic attainment.
More generally, this study suggests a model for deploying molecular genetics to assess
heterogeneous treatment effects: We use exogenous variation in the environment and combine it
with a well-validated genetic score that displays large and significant effects on the outcome of
interest in independent samples. Since heterogeneous treatment effects not only have important
implications for social and behavioral research and social policy but also appear to be the norm
in response to interventions or to naturally occurring environments (e.g. Angrist & Krueger,
1999; Heckman, 2001; Manski, 2009; Winship & Morgan, 1999), our intuition is that genotype
may provide the prism to separate out the “white light” of average treatment effects into its
constituent “rainbow” of heterogeneous responses by genotype. The present study, we hope, has
provided proof of concept for the utility of genotype as a moderator of social inputs that itself
may, in turn, generate hidden forms of inequality.
