Taxpayer Search for Information: Implications for Rational Attention

NBER Working Paper No. 19482
September 2013
JEL No. D80,D83,H24,H31
ABSTRACT
We examine novel data on searches for capital-gains-tax-related information to determine when and
how taxpayers acquire information. We find strong seasonal increases in information search around
tax filing deadlines, suggesting that taxpayers seek information to comply with tax laws. Positive
correlations between stock market activity and information search and year-end spikes in information
search on capital losses suggest that taxpayers seek information for tax planning purposes. Policy
changes and news events cause noteworthy information search. Overall, these data suggest that taxpayers
are not always fully informed, but that rational attention and exogenous shocks to tax salience drive
taxpayer information search.

Introduction
Taxes, especially income taxes, can be complex and confusing. Despite a

general awareness of this fact, the consequences of complexity and
misunderstanding are not well-understood. Survey evidence suggests that many
taxpayers do not understand basic tax concepts (Blendon et al, 2003), and the
compliance cost of taxes, including learning enough about them to comply, is large
(Slemrod, 1995; 2004). Given confusion surrounding tax incentives and tax law,
many taxpayers might simply ignore or misperceive the incentives built into the tax
code when they make decisions with tax consequences. Alternatively, taxpayers
might collect information on the taxes that matter to them, and use this information
to make tax-efficient decisions. Finally, taxpayers might learn just enough about
tax policies to fill out their tax return and perhaps avoid an audit.
In this paper, we investigate these alternative views of taxpayer information
search. We reject that taxpayers are fully informed about the tax system, that they
act in complete ignorance of the tax system, and that they gather information only
for tax compliance purposes. The evidence we present suggests instead that
taxpayers employ rational attention to tax policies, in line with theories proposed
by Sims (2003) and Reis (2006). In addition, we observe that exogenous shocks to
tax salience from news events can substantially increase information search.
Modern technology has greatly expanded the accessibility of information. Any
person with access to the Internet may, in a few minutes, learn at least something
about the most obscure details of the tax code. Taxpayers undoubtedly do use these
resources to seek information: people Google “tax” more often than they Google
the names of public figures,1 the IRS website has received on average 4.6 million
visits per day since 2004, and the IRS call line has received on average 125
thousand calls per day since 1999. How tax knowledge matters hinges on 1) how
For example, Google searches for “tax” were more common than searches for “Barack Obama,” and were more common
than “Obama” in all but the 2008 and 2012 election season.

and when people seek out tax-related information, and 2) whether they change their
behavior once they acquire it. In this paper, we address primarily the first of these
questions, and provide some preliminary analysis of the second.
Our data consist of aggregate high-frequency time series on calls to the IRS
toll-free phone number, aggregate visits to the IRS website, measures of Google
searches on tax-related terms, and views of tax-related web pages on Wikipedia.
We also use supplementary data on searches conducted on the IRS website and
referring pages to the IRS website. From these sources we collect data on
information seeking regarding one specific tax-related topic: capital gains taxes.
We select this topic because it is a perennially controversial policy issue, because
data on the relevant taxed behavior, sales of capital assets, are available on a highfrequency basis, and because the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013 (ATRA)
enacted a change in capital gains tax rates during our sample period.
We use data on information search to shed light on competing theories of
information and attention, and in particular different assumptions on the role of
information in decision-making. We study information-seeking around five
different types of events: 1) time notches, 2) macroeconomic changes, 3) policy
changes or the mention of potential policy changes, 4) filing deadlines or
approaching filing deadlines, and 5) tax-related news events.
Information search around the first three dimensions should be tied to the
taxpayer’s ability to make fully informed decisions affected by tax incentives. First,
a particular date is often relevant for the incursion of tax liability or the tax
efficiency of behavior. We call these time notches to indicate that tax liability can
change abruptly, and non-discretely, at certain dates, usually at year-ends. For
example, the last date to affect one’s capital gains tax liability in a given year is
December 31st. As the deadline approaches individuals may research the benefits
from realizing a capital gain or loss in the current year as opposed to a future year.
Second, macroeconomic changes may be associated with information search due to

2

perceived changes in the importance of understanding the tax consequences of a
particular behavior. For example, asset owners may seek information about capital
gains taxation as the stock market falls to understand the tax implications of their
losses. Third, actual or potential changes in tax policy or tax enforcement may cause
individuals to learn about the tax system, either to plan for the future or to make an
informed voting choice. Taxpayers might also seek information on the tax system
when completing their tax return. As such, the fourth dimension we study is filing
deadlines and the onset of these deadlines, when individuals may learn about taxes
due to approaching deadlines for filing tax returns. For the taxes we consider, the
deadline affecting most taxpayers is in mid-April.
News events sometimes spark public interest in tax policy, and in this case
individuals may search for tax information in order to develop an informed opinion
on current events or out of curiosity. The fifth dimension we study consists of news
stories such as the release of a public person’s tax information. We can view these
events as exogenous shocks to the salience of a particular aspect of tax policy. They
have no direct bearing on an individual’s tax burden, nor do they directly affect tax
incentives. The search may, however, provide information that incidentally informs
the searcher about her own decisions.
We observe strong seasonality in the search for information on capital gains
taxes through all channels. Taxpayer information search increases substantially
during the period commonly called “tax season,” which runs from mid-January to
mid-April of each year. An even more pronounced spike in information search
occurs very close to the filing deadline in mid-April. We also document the impact
of several discrete events on taxpayer information search regarding capital gains
taxes, through Google and Wikipedia. Presidential debates in which candidates
discuss their proposals for capital gains taxes, the passage on January 2, 2013 of
ATRA, the release of then presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s 2010 tax return in
January of 2012, presidential elections, and policy changes all generate large and

3

significant increases in taxpayer information search. In every case, these events
cause a spike in taxpayer information search that fades within three to four days.
Next, we find that macroeconomic changes affect information search on capital
gains taxes through Google and Wikipedia. We observe significantly elevated
information search on days with large trading volume in the stock market. We also
explore a measure of information search for personal investment advice generally,
using Google searches. Daily searches for stock advice predict searches for capital
gains tax on the same day, the previous day, and, in some specifications, one day in
the future. This is the first evidence we find, and in the literature, that some
taxpayers investigate the tax consequences of an action while contemplating the
action itself.
These patterns indicate that information search is consistent with a model in
which individuals search when different events make understanding tax policy
more important, i.e. when they increase the return to information search. However,
these results are also consistent with individuals making choices and then
researching the tax implications of those choices for their wealth. In an effort to
provide evidence that more strongly suggests a causal relationship, whereby events
cause individuals to search for information in order to make more informed
decisions, we examine information search on capital losses. We document
substantial elevation in information search related to capital losses at year-ends,
especially in 2008 (when capital losses from the stock market crash would have
made taxpayers’ more likely to be rebalancing their portfolios in order to take taxefficient advantage of capital losses). Observing increases in information search
just prior to the time notch is consistent with taxpayers seeking information on the
tax system and using it to improve decision-making.
This paper provides the first-ever attempt at understanding how, and why,
taxpayers search for information about government policy, specifically tax policy.
We establish that taxpayers seek information in order to both comply with their tax

4

obligation and to respond behaviorally to tax incentives. Taking taxpayer learning
seriously has important implications for understanding the impact of tax policy and
tax policy changes as well as for a full understanding of the nascent idea of tax
salience.

Literature Review

2.1

Public Understanding of Taxes
Political science research is fairly persuasive that voters know very little about

the details of government. Delli Carpini and Keeter (1996), in a comprehensive
survey of the political knowledge of voters covering several decades and hundreds
of surveys, show that the majority of voters are ignorant of many key aspects of the
U.S. political system. Surveys suggest that people are also largely ignorant of the
tax system (Blendon et al (2003) summarize the results).
One specific setting where researchers have investigated understanding of the
tax system is taxpayers’ perceptions of their average and marginal tax rate. Brown
(1968) and Fujii and Hawley (1988) find that individuals’ self-reported marginal
tax rate often differs from the true rate that can be estimated from their demographic
characteristics. Research by de Bartoleme (1995) shows that, in a lab experiment,
MBA students often confuse the average tax rate with the marginal tax rate when
making investments in a taxable versus non-taxable project. Sheffrin (1994) and
Liebman and Zeckhauser (2004) also find evidence that taxpayers systematically
misunderstand income tax schedules.
Recently, the public economics literature has settled on the term “salience” to
capture the extent to which tax aspects of the environment are noticed, and acted
upon, by those affected. A key paper in the modern literature is Chetty, Looney, and
Kroft (2009), who in a field experiment find that posting at the store shelf retailsales-tax-inclusive prices, rather than adding the tax liability at the point of sale,
reduces purchases. Their findings comes from an experiment at a large grocery
retailer in California, at which prices inclusive of the 7.375 percent state sales tax

5

were posted alongside the original pre-tax price over a three-week period for three
product categories (cosmetics, hair care accessories, and deodorants). They
estimate that the “tax treatment” reduced demand by 8 percent; given demand
elasticities of 1 to 1.5 for the affected products, they conclude that most consumers
do not take into account the sales tax revealed at the cash register.
2.2

Macroeconomics and finance
Many macroeconomists have considered how best to account for the inertia in

observed economic behavior and to what extent imperfect information can account
for it. For example, the models in Sims (2003) are motivated by the idea that
information that is freely available to an individual may not be used, because of the
individual’s limited information processing capacity. Alternatively, in Reis (2006)
consumers rationally choose to only sporadically update their information and recompute their optimal plans, while in between updating dates they remain
inattentive. Both models imply that news disperses slowly throughout the
population, so events have a gradual and delayed effect on behavior.
A recent literature in financial economics has taken advantage of newly
available data and focused on the demand by investors for information. Da,
Engelberg, and Gao (2011) propose the Google Search Volume Index (GSVI) as a
direct measure of investor attention. Drake, Roulstone and Thornock (2012) use the
GSVI for public company ticker symbols to examine the timing and magnitude of
Internet search around earnings announcements and the factors that influence
Internet search. Among their results of interest is that investors extend more effort
when the potential returns to search are higher.
2.3

Testable implications of theories
Although our analysis focuses on taxpayers’ search for information about

income taxes, it has more general implications regarding the information economic
agents possess when making decisions (in our case, often very economically large
decisions). Do individuals possess full information for important economic

6

decisions? If not, is attention to important information rational? If attention is
rational, how should we model information acquisition? We will shed some light
on the answers to these questions using patterns in the timing of information search.
To the best of our knowledge, all previous economic studies on attention have
assumed that attention itself is unobservable, but we take the approach of directly
observing attention and testing whether it conforms to the assumptions embedded
in the theory. Table 1 summarizes the predictions of the theories our analysis
illuminates, as described in this section.
The null hypothesis in our analysis is that taxpayer information search is
unresponsive to political or economic events. This hypothesis would be implied by
the assumption of full information, wherein an individual always has all data
necessary to make an optimal choice. Although frequently criticized and relaxed in
the economics literature, this assumption is still common in public finance for
modeling the response to tax incentives and the welfare cost of taxation. It stands
to reason that fully informed individuals should not search for information. Why
spend time researching something that is already completely understood?
In rational expectations models like the one proposed by Muth (1961), the
individual faces uncertainty about the future, but knows everything about the
present and costlessly and instantaneously absorbs all new information. Rational
expectations might allow searches for tax information to respond instantaneously
to unanticipated policy changes or shocks to the probability of a policy change, as
these require that the individual absorb new information about policy. However,
information search should not respond under rational expectations to economic or
political events that change the importance of understanding tax policy, but not tax
policy itself. Information search should also not respond to the implementation of
policy changes that were not surprises. Individuals should already possess all
publicly available information on tax policy.
An attractive alternative framework is rational attention, under which

7

individuals have limited capacity for processing new information and they allocate
that resource optimally. Alternative assumptions for how limited attention may be
rationally allocated are proposed by Sims (2003) and Reis (2006). In either model,
information search responds positively to events that increase the utility gain to
understanding the incentives at play in making a decision (such as a market
downturn or approaching time notch) and to events which introduce new
information about incentives (such as policy changes).
One difference between these two models concerns the precise timing of
information acquisition. In Sims’ (2003) approach, agents constantly update their
beliefs based on their attention to different sources of information, so we should
expect information search to instantly react to events that change the importance of
attending to a given bit of information. In Reis’ (2006) approach, updating beliefs
is costly and upon updating the individual simultaneously plans future consumption
and decides when to update again. In between updating dates, the individual is
inattentive to new information. Events like policy changes should affect
information search in the Reis (2006) model, but the searching should be spread
out over a longer time period, as not all individuals constantly update beliefs. We
can therefore use the timing of information search around unanticipated economic
and political events to test the difference between the mechanisms for rational
attention employed by the two models. A near instantaneous response indicates that
the data favor the Sims (2003) mechanism over the Reis (2006) one.
Attention is also the subject of a large literature in psychology. One useful
distinction in this literature is between “exogenous,” or “stimulus-driven,” attention
and “endogenous,” or “goal-directed,” attention (Theeuwes, 1994; Connor, Egeth,
and Yantis, 2004). Endogenous attention is the same as rational attention: the
individual voluntarily directs attention to meet a goal. Exogenous attention is
driven, rather, by an external stimulus, such as increased salience. In this case, the
individual might search for information regarding anything she sees in the news

8

which she does not understand, regardless of her gain from the search. If attention
to economic information is exogenously driven at times, information search should
respond to news events that mention policy—because these are usually
accompanied by news coverage that makes the policy more salient.

Capital Gains Taxation and Behavior
Capital gains generated from the sale of capital assets have received preferential

treatment relative to labor income since 1921 in the U.S. Income from the sale of
capital assets is recognized in the year of sale, and the taxable income is equal to
the sale price of the asset less its tax basis (the historical price plus any acquisition
costs and improvements to the asset, less any accumulated depreciation). Capital
gains and losses are divided into two categories, short-term and long-term. Longterm (short-term) capital gains and losses arise from the sale of a capital asset that
has been held for more than (less than) one year. Long-term capital gains receive a
favorable tax treatment and are currently taxed at a maximum of 20%. Short-term
gains are taxed as ordinary income. Gains and losses from short and long term
assets are netted together in well-defined ways to determine a taxpayer’s ultimate
tax liability.
A rational investor should maximize after-tax utility, which would entail taking
capital gains taxes into account in deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a capital
asset. First consider the purchase decision in isolation from the rest of an investor’s
portfolio. The taxation of the capital gains tax structure reduces the expected aftertax rate of return to a capital investment, where the reduction depends on the
expected appreciation, the expected holding period, and the likelihood that an asset
with appreciation can be held until death. Because higher capital gains taxes reduce
the attractiveness of assets expected to appreciate in value, one may expect that the
level of asset prices would react negatively to unexpected news about tax increases

9

(described as the capitalization effect).2
The decision of if and when to sell a capital asset should also be affected by the
tax system. Certain provisions in the tax code (for example, a lower tax rate for
long term capital gains), may encourage taxpayers to postpone an asset sale in order
to obtain the favorable tax treatment. Likewise, the annual nature of tax compliance
may also create annual rebalancing of portfolios to achieve a favorable mix of
capital losses and gains (such that the losses almost exactly cancel the gains), and
may encourage asset sales.
Because capital gains taxes are triggered by asset sales that happen in year t,
there is a planning deadline for capital asset sales at the end of the year. Therefore,
information gathering in order to achieve the best after-tax outcome with regards to
capital asset sales will have to happen by December 31 of year t. When capital gains
tax rates increase between year t and year t+1, December 31 is also the last date to
realize capital gains at the year-t tax rate. As such, information gathering in order
to shift capital income through time in response to a rate change will also need to
happen by December 31st of the end of the year.
Previous empirical evidence is largely consistent with taxpayers altering both
the nature and the timing of transactions in order to achieve the greatest possible
after-tax return on their capital investment. For example, as capital losses must
generally be offset with capital gains, large downward movements in the stock
market often leave investors with large unrealized capital losses that must be carried
forward until years when these investors realize capital gains. This policy leads to
the well-known strategy for minimizing capital gains tax liability of “loss
harvesting,” selling capital assets with built-in losses to offset the gains of assets
you have sold in the year. For example, Ivković, Poterba and Weisbenner (2005)

2 Of course, the effect of acquiring information about capital gains taxes depends on how it changes prior beliefs. One can
imagine a potential investor being pleasantly surprised to learn about the preferential lower tax rate and step-up basis at
death, or being discouraged upon learning that any tax at all applies upon the sale of appreciated assets.

10

find evidence of tax-loss selling at the end of the year. Poterba and Weisbenner
(2001) find that this is especially prevalent in years when changes in tax policy
provided additional incentive to harvest losses at year-end. While tax-loss selling
occurs in the corporate equity market, there is also evidence of such activity in
municipal bond closed-end funds (Starks, Yong, and Zheng, 2006) and the market
for long-term government and corporate bonds (Chang and Pinegar, 1986).

Data
Tax information is made available by the IRS, by accounting firms and other

organizations in the business of providing information generally, such as
Wikipedia. The IRS-provided information can be accessed through the Internet, via
printed information booklets, and through toll-free numbers. Person-specific
information can also be obtained by perusing one’s paycheck, one’s Form W-2, or
one’s prior tax returns. Both information from the IRS website and information
from non-government organizations may be found quickly using Google searches.
In all cases, the marginal cost of public information is only the time spent acquiring
it, provided one has an Internet or phone connection. The cost of tax information
decreased with the advent of the Internet, and search engines in particular. Longrun trends in information search may therefore vary due to both supply and demand
for information. By focusing on high-frequency variation in information search, we
isolate variation in the demand for information, since the supply changes little from
day to day.
We examine measures of information search through as many channels as is
feasible. We first study data on tax-related information search from Google,
accessed via Google Trends. One can use Google searches to find information from
a variety of sources, including Wikipedia and the IRS. Using query data on Google
searches, Google Trends provides a measure of the “propensity to search” for a
given search query or set of queries. More specifically, an observation in the Google
Trends data will be, for a given day and geographical region, the number of Google

11

searches for the specified search terms divided by the total number of Google
searches on any topic in the time and place.3 For our purposes, the search terms will
be a broad set of capital-gains-tax-related search terms, and the geographic region
is the United States. After calculating the propensity to search, Google scales it
from 0 to 100, where the number 100 represents the day with the highest search
volume for this set of search terms in the entire sample period. Our sample period
consists of January 1, 2004 (when data are available) through March 30, 2013.
Entering a given term into Google will frequently yield a Wikipedia page
related to that term as one of the first suggested sites to visit. Our second source
information search data is page view data from Wikipedia, a free online
encyclopedia edited by Internet users. We obtain hourly page views to the English
language Wikipedia site, “Capital Gains Taxation in the United States.” We add
these over the 24 hours in a day to obtain daily data for January 1, 2008 through
March 30, 2013. One disadvantage to the Wikipedia data is that it is available for a
substantially shorter time period than is the Google data. On the upside, we are able
to obtain the raw number of views of the webpage, which simplifies the
interpretation of the size of changes in information search. 4
Our third source of data regards aggregate calls made to the IRS’s toll free
phone number, where taxpayers can call and speak to a representative from the IRS
or listen to automated messages. In the course of a phone call with the IRS, some
taxpayers will listen to prerecorded messages about various “tax topics.” We
analyze daily phone calls that access the IRS tax topic 409, “Capital Gains and
Losses.”5 Taxpayers may reach the tax topics function in a number of ways,
including calling the tax-topics-specific phone number, or being referred to the
For more detail about Google Trends, see our web appendix and http://support.google.com/trends/?hl=en.
We have replicated the results in Section 6 and Section 7 using a measure of Wikipedia usage scaled in the same way as the
Google data, using page views of the Wikipedia home page as a metric of overall Wikipedia usage. This replication suggests
strongly that scaling is not confounding our results.
5 Other example of tax topics are tax topic 304, “Extensions of Time to File Your Tax Return” or tax topic 151, "Your Appeal
Rights.”

topic after a conversation with a representative or an interaction with the automated
system. We use data from February 1, 2002 to March 31, 2012.6 We also obtain the
total number of calls to the call line for individuals, which is not specific to capital
gains.
The last data set we analyze also comes from the IRS, and consists of the
aggregate daily number of visits7 to the IRS’s webpage. The IRS maintains a
website, IRS.gov, which hosts a vast amount of tax information. We obtain, directly
from the IRS, the total number of page views and visits, by day, to any site hosted
by IRS.gov. We are able to obtain this data for the entire time series for which the
IRS has maintained the data, February 1, 2002 to March 31, 2012. Analysis of
IRS.gov traffic carries the benefit of analyzing taxpayer information search about a
very broad set of tax information. This measure of information search is not limited
to information search about capital gains taxes specifically.

Estimation Procedure
Let Iit denote information search on date t from a source of information i, such

as Google, Wikipedia, or the IRS call line. We wish to estimate the effect of several
different events on information search through source i. The events we study may
be either non-recurring, as in the case of a Presidential debate that mentions capital
gains taxes, or may occur annually, as in the case of tax filing season. Non-recurring
events are indexed by the subscript k, and annual events are denoted according to
the day of the year on which they occur, denoted DoY.
As we discuss in more detail later, the data on inquiries display marked
seasonality at the yearly and weekly levels. In order to evaluate whether a particular
(non-seasonal) event increased information search on date t, we must properly

For a limited number of hours, Wikipedia data are unavailable. We scale the observation up by 24 divided by the number
of hours present in a day when only some hours are missing (15 days), and we use the previous day’s value when the entire
day is missing (128 days).
7 In contrast to page views, visits are a web analytic that count the number of page views from unique Internet Protocol (IP)
addresses in a given time frame.
6

13

specify the counterfactual level of search, conditional on the day of the week and
day of the year of date t. For example, suppose we want to know the impact of an
event occurring on March 1st, 2010. Suppose further, as we show later, that searches
are elevated in early March, compared to other times of year (because March occurs
during tax filing season). If we simply regressed information search on a dummy
variable for March 1st, 2010, we would then tend to over-estimate the impact of this
event if we did not control for yearly seasonality. We control for the day of the week
for the same reason: all of our measures of inquiries are higher on weekdays than
on weekends, so a consistent estimate of the impact of an event should control for
whether that event occurred, for example, on a Monday or a Saturday.
Unlike for much analysis of time-series data, yearly seasonality is of intrinsic
interest for our research questions. In particular, increases in information-seeking
during tax season will affect the form of the yearly seasonality. Information
searches occurring at the end of the year can be thought of as response to a time
notch. To address this concern, we employ a method that both estimates the
seasonal patterns and allows us to perform classical statistical tests for whether
information search is significantly higher on a particular day of the year than the
average level of information search. Specifically, for each information search series
i we estimate the function:
𝐼𝑖𝑡 = ∑𝑘 [𝛽𝑘0 𝐹𝑘𝑡 + 𝛽𝑘1 𝐹𝑘(𝑡−1) + ⋯ + 𝛽𝑘4 𝐹𝑘(𝑡−4) ] + 𝑥𝑡′ 𝛾 + 𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌𝑡 ) + 𝛿𝐷𝑜𝑊,𝑖 + 𝑢𝑖𝑡 (1)

The term inside square brackets is a set of dummy variables: 𝐹𝑘(𝑡−𝑗) equals 1 if
event k occurred on date (t-j) and zero otherwise. The four-day event window was
selected because when large spikes in information occur in the data, search levels
return to baseline within four days. We also include a vector of continuous, timevarying linear covariates 𝑥𝑡′ —such as trading volume on the stock market—along
with a general non-linear function in day-of-the-year 𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌𝑡 ), and a day-of-theweek fixed effect, 𝛿𝐷𝑜𝑊,𝑖 . We use data on 𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌𝑡−1 ) and 𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌𝑡+1 ) (the day

14

before and the day after day t) to estimate 𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌𝑡 ), under the assumption that
𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌𝑡 ) should not change too sharply from day to day.8
We proceed by employing a kernel-weighted local linear regression. The
strength of this estimator is that 1) it estimates a smooth trend in day-of-the-year,
which allows us to control for day-of-the-year when estimating the effect of events,
and 2) it increases the precision of the estimates of 𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌𝑡 ) relative to fixed effects.
A potential downside to the estimator is that the assumption that 𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌𝑡 ) does not
on average change too sharply from day to day may be wrong (especially around
April 15th). The strength of this assumption is governed by the bandwidth of the
estimator, and also by our choice of kernel density function. We discuss these
choices below. Our preferred choices for kernel density function (Gaussian) and
bandwidth (four days) produce estimates of seasonal trends that match the pattern
implied by fixed-effects estimates. To avoid conflagration of seasonal effects with
large outliers due to the events we document, we estimate all the components of
equation (1) in a single regression. The online appendix to this paper outlines the
estimation procedure in more detail. For a recurring annual event such as a filing
deadline, we can examine the function 𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌𝑡 ) on days-of-year corresponding to
the annual event to understand the effect of the event on information search. The
comparison that seems most natural is to test the hypothesis that, on a particular
day of the year, DoY’, inquiries are higher than their unconditional average, i.e. that
𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌 ′ ) > 𝐸(𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌)).9
Our estimate of the function 𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌) will inform us about the importance of
tax season for information search, but it may not capture all variation due to
compliance deadlines. 10 For example, the mid-April filing deadline does not occur
Alternatively, we could estimate 𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌𝑡 ) using day-of-the-year fixed effects. However, with only 5 to 9 years of data for
each type of inquiry, these fixed effects would be imprecisely estimated.
9This is the same hypothesis test we conduct by including day-of-the-week fixed effects, and inquiries on the “left-out” 𝐷𝑜𝑌
was a date on which searches were on average equal to the average over all days.
10 For Google data, the interpretation of the estimates is somewhat complicated by the fact that the dependent variable is a
measure of propensities to search. If there were yearly seasonality in overall Google searches, this would affect our estimat e

on April 15 of a given year if that date falls on a weekend or Emancipation Day.
Instead, it can occur as late as April 18 in some years. We account for variation in
compliance dates by year by including dummy variables for compliance events in
addition to the locally linear function. Our estimate of the function 𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌) will
estimate the average effect on April 15, but we add an additional dummy variable
for the precise date of the filing deadline to capture variation that occurs specifically
on the deadline each year. Doing so does not significantly change our picture of the
importance of tax season for inquiries, but it does highlight the sharp spike that
occurs exactly on the mid-April deadline each year. The inclusion of this dummy
variable also helps mitigate the smoothness assumption in estimating 𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌),
effectively imposing a bandwidth of zero on the date of the filing deadline. To
further reflect that the smoothness assumptions should not apply when there are
sharp changes on particular days of the year, we also include dummy variables for
the following holidays: New Year’s Day, President’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr.
Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.

Exploring the Raw Data
Figure 1 plots the evolution of three measures of information search on capital

gains taxes over time. Calls to the IRS hotline inquiring about capital gains taxes
occur almost exclusively during tax season, from mid-January to mid-April. The
absolute volume of calls occurring during a tax season diminishes considerably
throughout the time period, from 2002 to 2012. Wikipedia page views, in contrast,
increase over time. These patterns are consistent with online information largely
having supplanted telephone information as Internet access increased markedly
over the sample period. The Google measure displays a slight downward trend.11

of 𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌) by decreasing it on days of the year when Google usage was highest. The fact that the pattern estimated by Google
data and other measures of information search are similar largely alleviates this concern. The inclusion of day-of-the-week
fixed effects also makes our results robust to weekly seasonality in Google searches.
11 Recall that this does not mean that Google searches of capital gains taxes decreased over time, only that the share of Google
searches that concerned capital gains taxes decreased over time.

16

Visually apparent in each time series is a strong pattern of yearly seasonality.
This is most pronounced in the IRS call log series, where the yearly seasonality
drives virtually all of the variation in the series over time, but the pattern is also
present in Google searches and Wikipedia page views. Zooming in on a narrower
time frame also reveals strong weekly seasonality in each time series.
To focus on high-frequency variation, we detrend the data using a HodrickPrescott filter.12 To allow for visual comparison of the three measures of
information search, we normalize each variable by dividing by its standard
deviation. 13 Figure 2 plots the estimated yearly seasonality in the standardized
data.14 For each measure of information search, we observe a sizable and significant
increase in search behavior during tax filing season, and an even stronger spike in
the immediate run-up to the April 15 filing deadline. Right after April 15,
information search drops off sharply. The estimated seasonality in Figure 2 also
matches patterns in the timing of filing documented by Slemrod et al (1997).
Clearly, the desire to comply with the tax law as one fills out a tax return leads
taxpayers to search for information.
In the next set of figures, we focus more narrowly on variation in the
standardized, detrended, and seasonally-adjusted15 series around three dates where
we observe the largest spikes in information search. Figure 3 focuses on the spike
in October and early November 2008. There are two obvious candidates for
elevated information search in this time period: the presidential election of 2008,
and the stock market crash. Because capital gains taxes were an issue on which
candidates John McCain and Barack Obama differed substantially, the election

Whenever we use a Hodrick-Prescott filter in this paper, we use a smoothing parameter of 10 7. This value was selected by
trial and error, with the goal that the long-run trend capture long-run movements in the series but not variation due to yearly
seasonality.
13 Because the volatility of the IRS call log series varies significantly over time, we standardize it by dividing by its standard
deviation by year.
14 This estimate of seasonal effects comes from the regression in Section 7, and controls for event-driven outliers.
15 Seasonal adjustment consists of subtracting out estimated day-of-the-week effects, holiday effects, and the day-of-the-year
effect.

could influence search behavior due to either the desire to make an informed choice
about asset purchases or sales based on expected future tax policy, or due to the
desire to understand the consequences for future tax policy of a President McCain
or Obama. The market crash of 2008 resulted in large capital losses for many
investors and, due to the extreme volatility of the market, potentially also large
short-run gains. Our conclusion is that both the election and the crash played a role,
although it is difficult to disentangle the effect of the two events. Our conclusion is
based on the fact that the largest swings in the stock market in this period (marked
by red and black vertical lines in figure 3) are associated with spikes in search
behavior, and that information search surged around the date of the presidential
election. We present more evidence on how the crash might have affected
information search by focusing more narrowly on capital losses in section 8, and
Figure 6 provides further evidence on presidential elections.
Panel A of figure 4 plots the same series in January and February of 2012. We
attribute the observed surge in information search to the release of presidential
candidate Mitt Romney’s 2011 tax return on January 24. The release generated
substantial news coverage, in part due to his low effective tax rate. As most news
articles on the subject noted, much of Romney’s income came from the realization
of long-run capital gains taxes, taxed at 15 percent. Another possible explanation
for the spike in search behavior on this date is the State of the Union Address, which
also occurred on January 24, 2012. In his speech, President Obama advocated
taxing the wealthy at higher tax rates (supporting the “Buffett Rule”), but he
mentioned neither capital gains taxes specifically nor investment taxes more
generally. 16 It is, however, possible that Obama’s rhetoric on taxing the rich led the
public to pay greater attention to the news about Mitt Romney’s tax return, and

16 The “Buffett Rule” is a tax plan proposed by President Obama, wherein individuals making over $1.0 million in taxable
income would be subject to a minimum average tax rate of 30%.

18

thereby amplified its effect on capital-gains-tax-related information search.17
Panel B of figure 4 plots the data from detrended and seasonally adjusted data
at the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013. A presidential debate between Barack
Obama and Mitt Romney appears to have sparked considerable information search.
As in 2008, we also see elevated search immediately following the presidential
election, perhaps as voters and investors researched what might happen to capital
gains taxes in the aftermath of President Obama’s re-election. Finally, the largest
outlier in information search in the 10-year period covered by our data—an increase
of just over 4 standard deviations in Wikipedia page views and over 6 standard
deviations of Google searches—occurred on January 2, 2013. We attribute this to
the passage of the American Taxpayer Relief Act on that date. This bill temporarily
resolved what was commonly called the “fiscal cliff” debate, and increased the top
marginal tax rate on long-term capital gains from 15 percent to 20 percent. Our
evidence strongly suggests, therefore, that individuals search for information both
in response to policy changes and in response to potential policy changes signaled
by political events.

Regression Analysis of the Impact of Events
We start with the detrended and seasonally unadjusted time series. The

regression procedure we use, outlined in Section 5 and in the appendix, explicitly
controls for variation due to weekly and yearly seasonality. The notes to Table 2
describe the events we study, which are also discussed in the previous section.18
Table 2 describes the estimated impact of events on information search through

Further insight into this issue can be gained by examining Wikipedia intra-day search activity. Search activity started rising
dramatically mid-day on January 24th, 2012, consistent with Romney’s tax return being at least partially responsible for this
increase (as Obama’s speech was not delivered until that night).
18 There is modestly elevated information search via Google, Wikipedia or both, on a few dates that we do not include in the
analysis. These dates include January 18, 2004 (a State of the Union address delivered by George W. Bush advocating the
extension of capital gains tax cuts), November 2, 2004 (re-election of George W. Bush), May 16, 2006 (the extension of the
2003 capital gains tax cuts), January 27, 2010 (a State of the Union address by Barack Obama advocating a cut in capital
gains taxes for some taxpayers), and March 23, 2010 (passage of the Affordable Care Act, which included a “net investment
income tax”). In each case, the response of searches is qualitatively similar—a spike in searches that fades in three to four
days—but notably smaller than the events we do include in the formal analysis.
17

19

Google, Wikipedia, and the IRS web page. To examine statistical significance, we
perform F-tests on the β’s from equation 1, which generates a p-value that
corresponds to the probability that changes in information search of the magnitude
we observe would have occurred at random during the event window we specify.
The results suggest that the events we study each have a large and significant impact
on information search through Google and Wikipedia, but not through the IRS call
line.19 When we estimate the overall impact of the event rather than examining a
single-day impact, the release of Mitt Romney’s tax return surpasses the passage of
ATRA as the one-time event that generated the most taxpayer information search,
through both Google and Wikipedia. This occurs because the effect of ATRA
passage declined more rapidly, fading in two days instead of four. Notably, ATRA
passage was anticipated in the days leading up to January 2. The bill passed
Congress on January 1st, and the anticipated increase in the top capital gains rate,
likely generated income shifting from 2013 to 2012, which may have also caused
information search. From Figure 4, panel B, we can see that elevated information
search occurred on the two days prior to ATRA passage, December 31 and January
1st. Adding these dates to the event window increases the estimated impact of ATRA
by approximately 5 standard deviations for Google and Wikipedia, but changes
little else.

Relating Tax Information Search to Stock Market Activity
An advantage of focusing on capital gains taxation is the availability of high-

frequency data on sales of stock. Relating these data to data on information searches
holds the promise of better understanding the causal connections between
information search and capital-asset-related behavior. After all, we are not only
interested in what causes people to search for information, but also in to what extent

19 Two events are estimated to have an effect on calls to the IRS. However, seasonal variation in the volatility of the calls
measure means that the statistical significance procedure is biased for dates occurring during tax season. As such, we are
cautious about interpreting this episode.

20

the acquisition of information affects behavior, in this case behavior related to the
sale, purchase, and holding of capital assets.
8.1

The Lead-Lag Relationship to Volume, Volatility, and Market Return
Our first strategy is to examine the lead-lag relationship between measures of

behavior and information searches. If searches lead behavior, then we have reason
to pursue the idea that the information obtained affected subsequent decisions. We
investigate two data series, both of which represent general stock market activity.
The market-related measure we use is trading volume. We obtain the dollar
value of shares traded from all publicly listed firms from the Center for Research
in Security Prices (CRSP variable VOL), which we use as a measure of broad
market activity. 20 We then detrend the measure using a Hodrick-Prescott filter, and
include the log of daily trading volume in the regression described in equation (1).
For our baseline regression, we include five days of leads and lags of log trading
volume. These regressions control for the events we study and for weekly and
yearly seasonality. Columns (1) through (3) of Table 3 report the coefficients on
standardized data. See Appendix Figure A.1 for a graphical depiction of the leadlag estimates.
When trading volume is high, individuals seek more information about capital
gains taxes. The standard deviation of log trading volume is 0.2233, so the
estimates in table 3 suggest that a one-standard-deviation increase in trading
volume predicts a 0.064-standard-deviation increase in Google searches, and a
0.068 standard deviation increase in Wikipedia Page views. These effects are
significantly different from zero at the 10 percent level (p = 0.068 for Google, p =
0.055 for Wikipedia). We find that searches on date t are not significantly related to
trading volume on date t+1 or beyond. All of the association of market movement
Note that these transactions include many where the buyer and/or seller is not subject to capital gains taxes, may not be a
human trader capable of information search, or where the asset does not have an accrued gain that will be subject to taxation.
These possibilities do not threaten our identification so long as the percentage of transactions that is not subject to capital
gains taxes does not change substantially from day to day.

20

21

with information search occurs on the same date as the market movement, or one
day before. As a result, we are not able to determine from these data whether
individuals seek information on capital gains taxes primarily before or after they
make a decision regarding the sale of a capital asset. If they seek information before
making a decision, they do so less than a day in advance, as far as these data are
able to tell us.
We are sensitive to the possibility that much of the variation in these results may
be driven by behavior during the 2008 stock market crash, a period of extremely
high stock price volatility and trading volume. Columns (4) and (5) of Table 3
provide the estimates of the same regression specification, but limiting the inclusion
of market variables to the period from September 2008 to February 2009. Columns
(6) and (7) provide the estimates of the same regression specification, instead
excluding this extraordinary period. For both Google and Wikipedia data, the
estimated effect during the extraordinary period is much larger, although
imprecisely estimated. However, the estimated effects we have described survive
when the extraordinary period is excluded from the sample.
8.2 Do taxpayers search for capital gains tax information before they trade?
In this section we pursue an alternative indicator of the taxpayer demand for
capital gains tax information that is itself based on observed search volume. In
particular, we use Google Trends to obtain a measure of the volume of searches for
phrases related to personal investment advice such as “stock advice”, “should
buy stock,” “should sell stock,” and “investment advice.” In so doing, we hope to
learn more about the timing of the relationship between search for tax-related
information and decisions about whether to buy, sell, or hold assets. Note that,
although Google searches for investment advice can lead one to websites that
purport to provide such advice, searches for “capital gains tax” generally do not.
Table 4 shows the results of including the investment advice measure as an
explanatory variable in a regression on searches for capital gains tax information,

22

both in addition to stock trading volume and as a replacement for it.21 Several
results of interest emerge.
First, consider the results for Google searches. When investment advice search
volume is included as an alternative to stock trading volume, the same positive
contemporaneous association appears, and the effect of a one standard deviation
change on capital gains tax related searches is 40 percent lower. In a “horse race”
when both stock trading volume and investment-advice search volume are included
as explanatory variables, unsurprisingly the statistical significance of the former
declines because of the high correlation between the two variables. In the horse
race, investment advice search volume wins, retaining its significance while stock
trading volume losses its own significance. Strikingly, the one-day lag and lead
values of stock investment advice search volume are significantly positively
associated with capital gains tax search volume. This estimated association is
consistent with a story that taxpayers first recognize the need for information
regarding buying or selling stock and, in the process, learn that relevant to this
decision are the tax consequences.22
8.3

Google Correlate
While the above mentioned stock-related terms that we selected (e.g.,

“stock advice”) were correlated with searches for capital gains taxes in predictable
ways, Google, through its application Google Correlate, also has the ability to
provide a list of search terms most highly correlated over time with any given user
provided search term. Consistent with our other evidence that taxpayers
simultaneously search for information about capital gains taxes and investing,
among the top 20 search terms related to “capital gains tax” are “stock purchase,”
Appendix Figure A.2 graphically depicts the lead-lag structure estimated when stock advice search volume is included in
the absence of stock market trading volume.
22 The key advantage of the stock investment advice search volume variable is that it likely captures the extent of taxpayer
demand for information for which capital gains tax knowledge is crucial. One potential disadvantage is that in regression
analysis one may pick up any shocks that affect all Google Searches. To that point note in Table 5 that the same pattern of
results also applies when the volume of Wikipedia searches is the dependent variable, with one exception: the lead
relationship, although positive, does not reach statistical significance.
21

“investing,” “td waterhouse,” “fidelity mutual funds,” and “mutual funds.” 23
8.4

Capital Losses
Because the capital gains tax rules related to the sales of assets with capital

losses are especially important for many tax minimization strategies, such as loss
harvesting, we also construct two measures of information search related
specifically to capital losses. The first is weekly Google searches for the phrase
“capital loss,” and the second is monthly searches related to capital losses using the
search functionality on the IRS website, IRS.gov. We obtain the latter measure
directly from the IRS.24 These time series are plotted in Figure 5.
As with searches for capital gains, much of the variation is seasonal: people
tend to search for information on capital losses during tax season. There is also
typically an increase in searches in December of each year, when some taxpayers
“harvest” capital losses to reduce their tax liability. Of particular interest is the fact
that searches for information on capital losses increased dramatically during
October 2008, and surged even further in December of 2008. When the crash began
in October, investors began to research the tax implications of the unrealized or
realized losses they had sustained, perhaps evaluating the merits of pulling their
wealth out of (or investing in) the declining stock market. Furthermore, for an
investor who had lost money in the crash, harvesting capital losses before the end
of 2008 could reduce the taxpayer’s tax liability substantially. 25 The heightened
importance of loss harvesting from the stock market crash apparently caused even
more information search at year-end.
For both Google and IRS searches, we can also see that searches for information
on capital losses during tax season are higher after the 2008 crash than before, for

24 The IRS provided to us, at a monthly level, the most frequent search terms, and the number of searches for all terms with
the word “capital”, and “loss”, in the search.
25 This would naturally require that the investor had capital gains to offset with these losses.

24

three years after the crash. For several years after the crash investors realized capital
losses with greater frequency than before the crash. At the same time, information
search for tax compliance purposes also increased after 2008. This constitutes
additional evidence of spillovers between macroeconomic changes and information
search for the purpose of tax compliance, discussed further in Section 8.4.
8.5 Delayed effects
Not all information searches will happen immediately before or following some
event. In particular, behavior and market movement during the year can be
associated with information search at year end, as individuals decide whether to
realize capital gains or losses prior to a time notch. To examine this possibility, we
include an interaction of a year-end dummy—equal to one in the last five days of
the year and zero otherwise—with aggregated yearly trading volume (in Table 5,
End of Year X Log Vol. This Yr.) and the buy-and-hold market return for the year
that is ending (End of Year X Mkt. Ret. This Yr.). We obtain the buy-and-hold market
return using the CRSP daily return (variable VWRETD), cumulated over the entire
year. The yearly buy-and-hold return is a proxy for the overall market performance
that year, although it does not measure exactly accrued net capital gains from the
sale of stock.
Individuals may also increase search activity during tax season of the
subsequent year, as they research the compliance consequences of their previous
actions. We explore this possibility by including an interaction of a tax season
dummy—equal to 1 between January 30 and April 15—with aggregated yearly
trading volume (Tax Season x Log Vol. Prvs. Yr.) and stock market returns from the
previous year (Tax Season x Mkt. Ret. Prvs. Yr.). This allows us to examine if high
trading volume and/or returns in a year are associated with greater information
search for compliance purposes in the following year. The estimation controls for
weekly and yearly seasonality, and the impact of events (as in Table 3). We also
include the yearly aggregates with which we interact end-of-year and tax-season

25

dummies.
The results of this estimation are provided in Table 5. High trading volume in
year y is associated with elevated information search through Google and
Wikipedia at the end of year y, and with elevated information search through
Google, Wikipedia, and the IRS telephone hotline during tax season of year y+1.
High stock market returns in year y are associated with elevated information search
through Google and Wikipedia at the end of year y, but not with information search
during filing season. This pattern is consistent with market returns affecting the
gain to making tax-efficient decisions at year end—because timing matters more
for realizing large capital gains than small ones—while high trading volume affects
both the gain to making tax efficient decisions at year end and the number of
taxpayers who will need to understand capital gains to complete their tax return
come tax season.

Lessons from Aggregate Data on IRS Website and Call Line Usage
Figure 6 plots time series data on the use of the IRS website and call-line

usage that are not specific to capital gains taxes. In order for their effects to be
visible in broader measures of information search, events must significantly change
the importance of understanding taxes at a given time, for a large number of
taxpayers. Unsurprisingly, the IRS.gov domain and call line experience elevated
traffic during tax season. Note that the amount of traffic experienced during tax
season increases over time for the web page, probably due to increased use of the
Internet by taxpayers. The call line, in contrast, decreased in usage from 1999 to
2008, and then experienced a resurgence. Together these results suggest that the
Internet has not completely crowded out the use of the call line.
Most interestingly, we observe an abnormal surge in visits to IRS web pages
and calls line traffic in May of 2008. Search volume usually drops sharply after the
mid-April tax deadline, but in 2008 it remained high throughout the month of May.
Among the top five searches on the IRS web page during this month were

26

“stimulus,” “rebate,” and “stimulus check,” and many of the top pages viewed also
dealt with the stimulus rebates. The tax rebates enacted by the Economic Stimulus
Act of 2008 led millions of taxpayers to visit the IRS web page to investigate how
the federal stimulus program affected them. From more detailed data on the use of
the call line, we know that the IRS received over 50 million phone calls on stimulus
checks, corresponding to at least 11 million unique taxpayers. This corroborates the
evidence provided by Sahm, Shapiro, and Slemrod (2012) that these rebate checks
were a salient form of economic stimulus with a relatively high (compared to a
reduction in employer withholding rates) marginal propensity to consume. Using
the intuition of rational attention, it makes more sense for individuals to seek
information in May about their stimulus check if they intend to spend it compared
to if they intend to save it.
10

Conclusions
It is well-established that in general taxpayers know little about the US income

tax, and have systematic misperceptions. Given that acquiring information is costly,
it may be optimal for individuals to learn only if the expected return is high enough
and only when the information is most useful, known as rational attention. Because
people are learning—and forgetting—things all the time, the process of net
information acquisition is critical to a dynamic understanding of tax salience. Using
newly available IRS administrative data and publicly available information on
Google and Wikipedia searches, this paper establishes that people seek information
about the US income tax in systematic ways that are consistent with the idea of
rational attention. When policies change or seem likely to change, when filing
deadlines or time notches loom, people turn to online resources like Google,
Wikipedia and the IRS website, as well as traditional information resources like the
IRS telephone hotline, to learn how the tax code affects them. In addition, people
search for tax-related information when newsworthy events make taxes more
salient, and in so doing they may incidentally obtain information relevant to their

27

own decisions. When policy or news events generate exogenous shocks to the
demand for information, the responsiveness of information search to the event
occurs remarkably quickly: search behavior usually spikes on the same day as the
event, and falls back to baseline within three or four days. This timing pattern
suggests that Sims’ (2003) mechanism for modeling rational attention more closely
matches the data than the one proposed by Reis (2006).
We also present somewhat weaker evidence regarding to what extent acquiring
information about taxes leads individuals to alter behavior. We show that
individuals sought information about capital losses at year ends, especially after the
stock market crash of 2008, since harvesting losses provides an opportunity to
reduce one’s tax liability. This finding is consistent with many investors not
knowing the rules governing capital losses well enough to confidently apply them
to make their behavior tax efficient in the wake of the crash. Information acquisition
is a necessary component of the response to tax incentives, especially where more
obscure details of the tax code are concerned.
Our attempt to learn about taxpayer information search is limited because we
cannot account for all sources of information. For example, we cannot observe
taxpayers obtaining information from paid professionals. About 60 percent of
taxpayers do use a paid preparer when they file a tax return. Some of our measures
may, however, capture financial advisors’ information search. Further, we cannot
rule out “learning by doing,” whereby individuals learn about tax incentives while
filling out a return and then improve their future decisions. Nor can we observe
learning through social networks (as documented in Alstadsæter, Kopczuk, and
Telle, 2010). As in all similar studies, we also cannot quantify the amount of
learning that occurs via acquiring any one piece of information. Finally, taxpayers
for whom capital gains taxes matter are generally wealthier than the typical
taxpayer. These individuals may be more sophisticated in their use of information
than the typical taxpayer, and many can afford to pay for high-quality information

28

from financial advisors. Future work should examine patterns in information search
about other policies for this reason.

Notes: *News events may inspire attention “rationally" due to a preference for being informed in public discussion of current events, but it will
not inspire rational attention for the purpose of economic behavior, either capital gains realizations or tax compliance. ** By "with delay," we
mean that the surge in information search as a result of the event should be spread out over a longer time period in the Reis (2006) model
compared to the Sims (2003) model, as different taxpayers reach the date at which they (previously) decided to update at different times.

same estimate in the original units of the search volume measure, i.e. the Google Trends
index or, Wikipedia page views, or number of calls to the IRS. The bottom number, in
parenthesis, reports the p-value from an F-test in which the null hypothesis is that the
event had no impact on information search, i.e. that the variation in information
searches over the event window is purely random. The estimation controls for variation
due to yearly and weekly seasonality.

Notes: The dependent variable and log trading volume are de-trended prior to estimation, and the dependent variable is standardized by dividing
by the standard deviation of the detrended data. We control for weekly and yearly seasonality and the events in Table 2 (except those events that
occur outside the sample period, since market data are not available past December 29, 2012). Weekends and holidays are omitted, since stock
market data are not generated on weekends. The regression included five market-dated leads and lags of each measure. We only report one lead
and one lag for brevity and clarity (See Appendix Figure A.1). The coefficients are similar if we use 14 leads and lags instead of 5, and none of
the results change substantially with the inclusion of lags of the dependent variable. Standard errors are provided in parentheses below point

Obtaining and Analyzing Google Trends Data
When querying Google Trends, the user provides 1) search terms, 2) a geographical
window, and 3) a time range. As we are studying a tax issue within the United States, for all
data used in this paper, the geographical range is specified to be the United States.
When the number of overall searches for a given term is too low, Google Trends will
report an SVI of zero, or will report daily at a weekly or monthly level (as opposed to daily
SVI data). We encounter this issue if we query searches for “capital gains tax” alone. As such,
we use a set of search terms to maximize our sample period for which we are able to obtain
daily data. The search terms we include are, according to Google Trends itself, highly
correlated with searches for “capital gains tax.” The set of search terms is the following:
 Capital gains tax
 Capital gains tax rate
 Capital gains taxes
 Capital gains tax rate
 Capital gains calculator
 Capital gains
 Capital gains rate
We have verified that 1) the daily time series of SVI for simply “capital gains tax” is
virtually identical to the one from the broader set of search terms, but with fewer missing data,
and 2) we obtain nearly identical results for event studies and market movement effects if we
use simply searches for “capital gains tax” as our left-hand-side variable instead of the broader
set of search terms, but with slightly larger standard errors (reflecting the decreased number of
observations).
For the same reasons as above, we use multiple search terms related to stock advice.
These are:
 Stock advice
 Stock market advice
 Stock tips
 Stocks to buy
 Stock to buy
 Stocks to sell
 Should buy stock
 Should sell stock
 Investment advice
 Investment tips
By default Google Trends provides weekly data when a user downloads a time series
longer than three months. In order to access daily search volume data, one must query Google
Trends in three month intervals. Fortunately, one can query several (up to five) three-month

periods at once.
In order to obtain daily data while maintaining proper scaling of the variable across the
entire time series, however, one must query Google Trends very carefully. The data are scaled
so that SVI takes the value of 100 on the day with the highest propensity to search out of any
date range and search terms. For example, if January 2, 2013 were the day with the highest
propensity to search for capital gains tax terms (as it is), SVI would equal 100 on that day if
January 2, 2013 were in the period provided by the user. In order to obtain daily data that is
properly scaled for the full sample period, one must first find the single day with the highest
search volume, and then include a time period containing that day along with sets of other
three-month periods.
To get a properly scaled daily time series, we therefore include the time period January 1,
2013-March 31, 2013 in every single one of our queries for capital gains tax SVI, along with
other three-month periods, until we obtain data for our entire sample period. The figure below
shows an example of what such a query would look like to pull daily data for the year 2009.

Estimation Procedure

Recall that the equation to be estimated is
𝐼𝑖𝑡 = ∑𝑘 [𝛽𝑘0 𝐹𝑘𝑡 + 𝛽𝑘1 𝐹𝑘(𝑡−1) + ⋯ + 𝛽𝑘4 𝐹𝑘(𝑡−4) ] + 𝑥𝑡′ 𝛾 + 𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌𝑡 ) + 𝛿𝐷𝑜𝑊,𝑖 + 𝑢𝑖𝑡 (1)

In order to consistently estimate equation (1), which contains a non-linear function and a
set of linear covariates, we use the double residual regression method suggested by Robinson
(1988), also discussed in Hardle and Linton (1994). This first step of this three-step estimator
consists of several non-parametric regressions of the following form:
𝐸 [𝑋𝑡 ] = 𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌𝑡 ),
where 𝑋𝑡 is the dependent variable or one of the linear covariates, i.e. Iit, Fkt, xt or δDoW,t. We
then obtain the residuals from this regression, which we denote with star superscripts. The
residuals represent the component of Iit, Fkt, xt or δDoW,t not correlated with the general withinyear pattern represented by 𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌𝑡 ). The second step estimates the linear components of the
model consistently using ordinary-least-squares regression on these residuals:
∗

∗
∗
∗
∗
] + 𝑥𝑡′ 𝛾 + 𝛿𝐷𝑜𝑊,𝑖
𝐸[𝐼 ∗ 𝑖𝑡 ] = ∑𝑘 [𝛽𝑘0 𝐹𝑘𝑡
+ 𝛽𝑘1 𝐹𝑘(𝑡−1)
+ ⋯ + 𝛽𝑘4 𝐹𝑘(𝑡−4)

(2)

The third step regresses the residuals from the estimation of equation 2—denoted by 𝐼 ∗∗ 𝑖𝑡
— non-parametrically on DoYt to obtain a consistent estimate of the function 𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌𝑡 ).
𝐸[𝐼 ∗∗ 𝑖𝑡 ] = 𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌𝑡 )

(3)

The first and third steps involve non-parametric regression, which Robinson (1988)
suggests implementing via kernel-weighted local polynomial regression. In this paper, we use
local linear regressions with a Gaussian kernel density function and a bandwidth of four days.26
This procedure estimates a weighted OLS regression of the dependent variable on DoY at each
value of DoY in the data, where the weights are determined by the kernel density function and
the bandwidth. The bandwidth was selected to visually match the fixed-effects estimator of the
function 𝑓𝑖 (𝐷𝑜𝑌𝑡 ), but a data-driven choice of bandwidth—specifically selecting the
bandwidth that minimizes the conditional weighted mean integrated squared error—yields
nearly identical results. The estimates we present are also virtually unchanged by varying the
This bandwidth and kernel density function applies to non-parametric estimations from the third stage of the procedure, and nonparametric
estimations involving continuous variables in the first stage. For discrete variables in the first stage, such as event dummy variables, we use
a bandwidth of zero, to reflect that there should be no smoothing at this stage. Another complication is that traditional statistical packages and
programs will implement the smoothing on a linear variable, while day-of-the-year is a cyclical variable. That is, January 1 and December 31
should be adjacent for smoothing purposes. Ignoring this problem results in a discontinuity in the seasonal pattern between these two days.
We eliminate the discontinuity by estimating the seasonal pattern twice: once where the discontinuity is imposed at January 1, and a second
time where the discontinuity is imposed at the 200 th day of the year (July 19th). Then, we replace the 10 days around January 1 from the first
estimation with these days from the second estimation.

exception that a wider bandwidth results in a smoother function that no longer resembles the
fixed-effects estimates and a narrower bandwidth results in a more jagged function.
