Automobile Prices and Quality:
Did the Gasoline Price Increase Change Consumer Tastes in the U.S.?

ABSTRACT

Did the 1973 and 1979 gasoline price rises change consumer views

about the relative quality of different cars? This question is investigated
by testing the null hypothesis that imputed characteristic prices have remained constant over time. A hedonic model that takes gasoline costs into
account is developed and some of its theoretical implications are outlined.
The statistical methods required for its estimation and for the testing of
the particular null hypothesis are discussed and then used to analyze the

prices of U.S. passenger cars in the used market during 1970—1981. If one
does not take &asoline costs into account in such computations one must conclude that consumers changed their relative evaluations of car qualities
significantly in both periods: October 1973 to April 1974 and April to October

1979. However, when gasoline efficiency terms are included in the model, the
estimated relative qualities are much more stable over time, with no period
showing significant changes, and it is possible to maintain the "constancy of

tastes" assumption. Since the main model adjusts not only for the effect of
gasoline price increases but also for the effects of changes in other prices
and income, we develop two alternative approaches which adjust solely for the

increase in gasoline prices. Applying these to the 1979 period we find that
a significant fraction of the coefficient change that did occur during this
period can be attributed to the gasoline price increase alone, indicating
that this is indeed a major component of what happened.

Introduction
The energy crises of 1973 and 1979 and the associated increases

in gasoline prices (see table 1) caused consumers to change their demand
for automobiles and automotile manufacturers to adjust their products and

prices to these changes. These events affected all the major dimensions
of this market: (1) in the quantity dimension the market share of small
cars increased relative to that of the large ones; (2) the price of small
cars increased relative to that of large cars and the imputed characteristic prices (of weight, engine displacement, and gasoline miles per gallon)
changed; and, (3) so did also the various automobile qualities: there
occurred a downsizing in terms of length, weight, and horsepower, and an
increase in gasoline efficiency.
While most analyses of these events start

from the quantity

dimension, looking usually at changes in quantities demanded or market
shares [e.g. Carison (1978), Greenlees (1979), Boyd and Meliman (1980)],
a growing body of literature has recently taken the dual point of view
and looked primarily at prices [Kahn (1981), Daly and Mayor (1983), Gordon

(1983), Berndt (1983)]. We join this line of research but ask a somewhat
different question, using a different model and different statistical
methods.

1

We use the hedonic hypothesis that automobile prices are a function
of their characteristics, estimate the imputed prices of such characteristics
and examine the effect of the gasoline price increases on them. Since the
estimated quality of a car is the sum of the products of such imputed prices

with their respective characteristic levels, we shall be analyzing how changes
in gasoline prices affected the perceived qualities of different automobiles.

—2—

The used car market is our source of information. In the used
car market quantities are fixed (more or less) and prices are determined
primarily by consumer demand and can therefore be assumed to reflect

current consumer tastes and price expectations. In contrast, new car
prices are set by the manufacturers and need not be consistent, ex post,
with the way consumers actually value the different models.

While one may think that consumers changed their notions of
"quality," shifting their tastes towards smaller cars as the result of
the two energy crises because small cars are more fuel efficient (as
measured by miles per gallon which we abbreviate as MPG), this is not

necessarily so. Because the amount of gasoline used does not enter the
utility function directly but only through the budget constraint, it is
possible that relative quality valuations did not change during the

the energy crises once gasoline costs are accounted for appropriately.
The main purpose of this paper is to examine this possibfity empirically.
If we define the full price of an automobile as the sum of its market price and the (gasoline) cost of operating it, we can restate the previous
paragraph as follows: the energy crises may have increased the price of small

cars relative to the price of large cars without changing much their relative
full prices.3
Since imputed characteristics prices depend on consumer tastes (as
well as on other factors), if we could show that correctly defined and

measured these prices did not change, we could maintain the hypothesis that

—3—

the underlying consumer preference structure did not change after all.

The hypothesis of no change in consumer taste is important for
economic- analysis, especially for comparative statics of consumer behavior.

Hirshielfer (1976, p. 11) illustrates it by noting that when economists try
to explain the effect of a tax on the demand for liquor, they "will almost
automatically assume that the desire to drink is just as great (that is,
preferences do not change by the imposition of-tax) ——

only

that the tax

makes it more expensive to indulge that desire (that is, tax (or higher

price of liquor) affects budget constraint)." Economists cannot use their
theoretical models and empirical estimates to explain the effects of such
changes as the imposition of atax or a gasoline price increase if consumer

preferences change in an unknown manner.
If the cost of gasoline is not taken into account, we expect to
observe large changes in the imputed prices, of automobile characteristics

and ip the estimated relative quality of different cars. We would like to
know if these changes stopped soon after the oil price shocks were over. If
this were the case, we could say that U.S. consumers adjusted their
evaluation of quality differences rather quickly to the gasoline price

increass.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: First (section II)
we outline Qur 'theoretical framework, restate the hedonic approach, and

outline our estimation procedure.

Next we describe our data (section

III) and present our main empirical results (section IV).

II. Model, Implications and Statistical Method
The hedonic approach [augh (1928), Court (1939), Griliches (1961)]
assumes that complex commodity prices are a function of their quality
characteristics and estimates the imputed prices of such characteristics
by regressing the prices of different commodity models on their charactcr-r

istic levels. Muellbauer (1974), Lucas (1975) and Ohta (1980) show that
the hedonic hypothesis can be based on Lancaster's (1971) consumer choice
theory.

To make clear the distinction between characteristics that enter
the utility function and those that enter only the budget constraint we

start with a simple one—period model of consumer behavior. Suppose that
there are only two kinds of goods, automobiles and other goods. Let

yi, y2, ...,

y)

be a vector of automobile performance characteristics

such as speed, roominess, comfort, handling, etc. Let x

(x1, x2, ...,

x)

be a vector of physical characteristics such as weight, length, horsepower,

etc. In general we expect y rather than x to enter the consumer's
utility function. But since y can be thought of as a function of x
(which is the two—stage hypothesis of Ohta—Criliches, 1976), and if this
function is stable over the period of observation we can write the utility

function as u =

u(x,

K, z), where K is the number of miles driven and

z is the quantity of other goods.
We assume that the consumer buys only one car and that he has to

choose among a number of different car models. Then he is faced with the
following maximization problem:

To implement this model empirically we shall have to assume that

all the square and cross—product terms vanish. We have tested this
and it is supported by the data for

assumption partially

the square terms but not for the cross—product ones. Nevertheless, since
we shall be analyzing the data as a system of equations, treating each
half—yearly observation as a separate equation, we had to pare down our

model further to make it operational. Hence we replace (2) by

The imputed price of characteristic i(ci.) is its marginal utility

Note that since the cost of

gasoline enters only the budget constraint and not the utility function
does not depend directly on the utility function but only indirectly through
K.

to satisfy equation (5) which indicates that

and on

consumer tastes.

If tastes change then the relative values of a's should change.

One of the purposes of this paper is to test the null hypothesis of the

constancy of the relative values of the a's. But even if this hypothesis is
rejected, this does not necessarily imply that consumers tastes did in

fact change, since the a's depend not only on the form of the utility
function but also on the level of x.

Looking at (5) we see that the market price of a car is equal
to its benefit minus cost, where benefit is the money value of the services

it produces (

atx.)

and cost is the cost of operation (in this case just

the cost of gasoline
Pg•K/MPG)•

Equation (5) can be rewritten as

P(x, MPG)

The

left

+ Pg•K/MPC = a x1

(6)

hand side is the sum of the market price of a car and the gasoline

cost of operating it. Following the terminology of household production
theory (Becker, 1965), this sum is interpreted as the full price of the

car. The above equation shows that the full price of a car can be estimated
by a weighted sum of its characteristics (excluding MPG), and is equal to
its estimated "quality."
When quality—adjusted consumer price indexes for a commodity are
constructed using the "price—link" method, it is common to assume that the

market price ratio of goods is equal to their quality ratio. Equation (6)
shows that this is wrong. The quality ratio (the ratio of the

x.'s)

—9—

is not equal to the ratio of market prices (ratio of P(x, MPG)for different

models) but rather to the full price ratio (ratio of P(x,MPG) +

PgK/MPG)

To definethe true quality adjusted price index note that the imputed

absolute characteristic prices of a! can be rewritten as a! = u

P

a is now the relative marginal utility of characteristic i,

and P is the quality adjusted price level (in terms of the numeraire com-

modity z) to which all these marginal utilities have to be equated. Denoting

the gasoline cost component by g, equation (5) can be reparameterized
P(x, MPG) = P

where P

a. x. — g

(7)

can be interpreted as the quality adjusted full price index.

When we come to actual estimation we shall have to parameterize g further
as will be explained below.
To see the implication of our null hypothesis about the constancy
of tbe characteristics prices

(a.) we digress further: suppose the

price of gasoline (Pg) changes. Let us denote the change in values of the
various variables after the gasoline price change by L .

Then, the null

hypothesis implies that

AP Ea1x_Ag

(8)

where AP = AP(x, MPG). Comparing the resulting relative price change for
two different models, h and k, we get

—10—

hh

=

l'k

AP cxx(h) -Ag(h)

(9)

L ax(k) -Ag(k)

indicating that since Ag is likely to differ for different cars the relative price structure of different car models will change as the result of
the gasoline price change even without any changes in consumer tastes (that

is, no change in the a.'s).
When oil prices increase, it will generally be the case that
Ag > 0

and Al' > 0, where the latter happens because of the inter—industry

input—output relationships and the increase in energy cost. Then the first
term in the right hand side of equation (8) is positive whil.e the second
term is negative and it is possible that the energy crisis can increase the
prices of some cars (typically compact cars) in absolute value while decreasing the prices of other cars (typically full sized cars).

If there is no change in the true "full" price index (AP =

0),

equation (8) reduces to

AP =

—Ag

and the prices of all

(10)

cars decline, including the price of compact cars.

Furthermore, if there is no change in miles driven (K), in spite of
the increase in the price of gasoline, then (10) becomes

small gasoline cost—price ratios.

Returning to the formulation of the regression model and remembering that
automobiles are durable goods, we have to extend it to the multi—period context.

Let P(x, MPG) be the price of a car of vintage v at

time t with

characteristics x and fuel efficiency MPG when new.

The age of

this dependency. We denote the length of life of a car by T. As Manski
(1980) has shown, T is a consumer decision variable (scrappage rate in his

case) and will depend on t.
Following Hall (1971) and Kahn (1980), we write automobile prices
as the discounted sum of their net rental values over time. Denoting

the interest rate by r, we rewrite ( 5

Consumers calculate this expected

Since we are interested only in comparing

discussing possible changes in the relative prices of charac-

teristics, this redefinition does not matter. For typographical simplicity,
we shall drop the distinction between a' = a/Q

and a, but it should be noted

that the meaning of these coefficients is now somewhat different. (We shall

ignore the Q(t) term, as it will be subsumed in the year dummies that we
shall add to each cross—section). Using dummy variables to estimate the
hedonic price index

and depreciation term s), equation (12) can be

respectively.

As noted before, one of the main purposes of this paper is to test
7

the constancy of the ct.'s over time in equation (17). We allow ,

y

and E to change over time in such tests, because they ef]ect also the
overall levels of gasoline, automobile, and other prices
and income.

The age coefficients

are also allowed to change

over time because deterioration patterns may have changed for different
vintages.

There are several econometric issues which arise in trying to estimate

(17) and its various variants. First, P appears also on the right hand
side of the equation, as a divisor of the gasoline cost component. We solve
this problem by using a three—stage procedure: First the log P equation is

estimated based on the x's (characteristics) alone, yieJding a P to be
used in stage 2 to estimate equation (17). This yields a new P, which is
used in the final third stage to reestimate (17).8

Since the ,

y,

and

parameters in (17) depend on many other

things besides gasoline prices, we would like to ask whether the changes that
occurred in the coefficients are due primarily to changes in gasoline prices

(or more correctly, to changes in the evaluation of fuel efficiency). One

way of doing this is to use equation (5) to predict car prices in time t + 1
from the estimated coefficients in time t (denoting them as

and

and the rate of gasoline price increase between t and t + 1 (denoting it
as o).

If the gasoline•prjce changes are the main cause of the changes in the

coefficients

then &.x. + (1 + o/MPG should predict car

prices at t + 1 well up to a constant.
method."

We call this the "prediction

—17—

The other way of doing this is to consider the misspecified version

of (17), in which the gasoline terms are excluded, say log P =

while

the true equation is a.x. — g/M, where we have dropped the various

year and age dummy variable terms to simplify the exposition, g

and N = MPG.

Consider the linear projection (auxiliary equation) of l/M on x:

P.x.;

then, by the well known omitted variables argument9 we can write

1/N =

P. =

— gii.

Suppose gasoline prices increase by a percent, holding other things

constant. Then g is also increased by a percent. Letting . be the value
of P. after this increase yields
=

We

-g=

can examine, therefore, the effects of gasoline price increases

isolated from other changes by estimating unconstrained and constrained
versions of (17), without the gasoline consumption terms, and ask whether the

estimated P parameters satisfy the constraints implied by the

formula.

In both versions P(x, MPG) is the price after the gasoline price increase.
If the SER of the constrained regression is not much larger than that of the
unconstrained, then changes in the imputed prices of automobile characteris-

tics can be explained mostly by the gasoline price increases. Other factors,
such as general price level and income, do not affect the imputed prices much.

We use the SUR (seemingly unrelated regressions) procedure in estimating

the various versions of (17). Since it is likely that our list of characteristics is incomplete and since we have omitted the cross terms of 1/MPG and x
we expect a non—negligible correlation between different year but same model

residuals. The observed correlation is close to 0.9.

Another way to

—18—

reduce the effect of omitted characteristics would be to use

dummy variables for the different car makes. But even if we use such
make dummies, the correlation coefficient is still high (around 0.7).

We use, therefore, the SUR procedure which does take into account this kind
of correlation in evaluating the precision of our estimates.

The usual F—statistic for testing hypotheses in such frameworks [the
SUR version is given in Theil (1971), equation (3.6) on pp. 314] has the
following shortcoming, as Learner (1978) points out: When the number of observations is large,

the computed F—value tends to be large, the

critical F—level is small'0,

and the null hypothesis is almost always

rejected. (Our sample sizes are around 500.) This makes little sense and
hence several alternative testing approaches have been suggested in the
literature.

Learner derives a Bayesian critical level LB under the assumption
of diffuseness of prior information. We will use this critical level in
our F—tests:

LB

).(fl/n —

1)/q

Here k is the number of parameters in the unconstrained regression and q
is the number of parameters to be constrained by the null hypothesis.
In addidition, when testing the null hypothesis we shall look not only

at the F—value but also look at the estimated standard error of regression

(abbreviated as SER). Following Arrow (1960) and Ohta—Griliches (1976), we
judge the practical significance of the null hypothesis by comparing the
difference in SER between the constrained and the unconstrained regressions.

If the difference in SER (abbreviated as ASER) is smaller than .010 in the
system under the test, we do not reject the null hypothesis practically.

Since the left hand variable is the logarithm of price, an increase in SER

—19—

by .010 implies an increase in the standard deviation of the unexplained

component of price of about 1 percent. Since SER in our regression is
around .2, the .010 criterion implies that we are willing to accept up to

a 5.0 percent deterioration in fit. We call this test the ASER test. We
use the SER of OLS rather than the SUR one in this test because we are
interested in the decrease in "fit' due to the imposition of the null hypothe-

sis and because OLS minimizes the actual sum of squared residuals while the
STJR

method does not do so, minimizing instead a transformed version of it.
The iSER test can be thought of as examining whether the imposition

of the null hypothesis of relative constancy of imputed characteristic prices
makes a substantive difference to our estimates of the overall "quality" of

different cars. Letting Xk

car model k and
istics at time t,

= (xik)

be the vector of characteristics of

=

(aj) the vector of imputed prices of characterthen a
Ia x,
tat
o (that is, the ratio of the fitted

values) is the estimated relative quality of model a, relative to model b,

at time t.

Since the left hand variable is the logarithm of price, ASER

measures the difference in fitted values (that is, in relative estimated

qualities) caused by the imposition of the null hypothesis.

Since consumers buy a bundle of characteristics x embodied in a
particular car rather than specific amounts of one or other characteristic,

changes in the overall quality ax may be of more interest than changes in
the individual price ratios. If the ratios of the imputed prices are constant
over time, then relative qualities of different models do not change. Even
if there is a change in the imputed prices, relative qualities may

still

not

change. This can happen because characteristics are highly collinear. For

example, if Xa

= (1,

2) and

=

(2,

4) are the characteristic vectors of

—20—

models a and b respectively, the relative quality of model b
is two irrespective of imputed prices. Thus, significant changes in relative imputed prices of characteristics need not imply significant changes
in the relative quality evaluations of different cars.

III. Data
Our data on U.S. domestic passenger car prices and characteristics
are taken from N.A.D.A. Official Used Car Guide.

We collected the charac-

teristics of 1966 to 1980 vintage cars and their prices in the used car

market biannually (October and April) from 1970 to 1981A. In these data six
years is the oldest: age that we observe. We do not use the October prices of new

vintages in our study of the used market, because transactions in these
cars are not numerous enough to make their prices a reliable reflection of
consumer evaluations.

11

The earlier Ohta—Griliches data set contained only sedans and hardtops

with four or two doors. The new data collected for the 1970—80 vintages
include

also station wagons and coupes with four, two, three, and five doors,

encompassing all segments of the passenger car market.
The following physical
of

characteristics were used by us:

(1) number

cylinders, (2) shipping weight (in pounds), (3) number of doors, (4)

wheelbase (in inches), (5) length (inches), (6) width (inches), (7) CID
(cubic inch displacement of engine), (8) brake horsepower, (9) AT (dummy

for automatic transmission, 1 if standard, 0 otherwise), (10) PS (dummy for
power steering, 1 if standard, 0 otherwise), (11) AC (dummy for aircondition—
ing, 1 if standard, 0 otherwise).

—21—

MPG data are taken from E.P.A. publications, but these are available

only for 1974 and later vintages. Furthermore, they are for city driving in
some years and for highway or combined

city and highway driving in other years.

(This is indicated in Appendix Table A2.) We can match our sample cars perfectly
with the cars in E.P.A. publications after 1975. In 1974, the ratch is imperfect
and we use occasionally the MPG data for the nearest available similar car
(nearest in CID and weight within the same make).

We used Facts and Figures of Consumer Reports to get the MPG data for

1966—73 vintage cars. For 1966 vintage cars, we use traffic gas mileage data,
which involve acceleration, 35 mph maximum, idling, and an average speed for

the course of about 21 mph. For 1967—73 vintage cars, we use the arithmetic
average of the upper and lower extremes of the range of gas mileage to be

expected in normal use. The upper extreme is for short—range stop—and—go
traffic and the high extreme is for open—road, constant—speed trips. Thus,
the Consumer Reports MPG data correspond roughly to city MPG data of E.P.A.

although we do not use both data simultaneously. The number of models for
which Consumer Reports MPG data are available is rather small (see Table A$).

IV Empirical Results

The impact of the oil—price rises on the used car market is our
primary interest.

We hope to show that these events affected

this market in an intelligible way. We shall do this first by estimating more or

less standard hedonic price equations for used cars and showing that their
coefficients changed over time, especially during the two major gasoline price

rise episodes (1973—74 and 1979—80). Second, we add fuel consumption efficiency variables to these equations and show that the coefficients of the

remaining characteristics are now much more stable over time. Finally, we
examine if the changes observed in the first set of results can be
accounted

for by the changes that occurred in gasoline prices. By

and large, all these questions are answered affirmatively, indicating that

this market (and the consumers that are active in it) responded as one might

have predicted to changes in its economic environment, and did so quite
rapidly.

The first set of calculations is based on comparing pairs of
adjacent time period equations

-

using the same set of vintages and

models for the comparison. One set of equations is estimated unconstrained,
allowing all the coefficients to differ across time periods, while the
seco8d

set imposes the restriction that the coefficients of the various

physical characteristics, the "imputed prices," are constant over time. Both
versions are estimated using the STiR procedure which allows the residuals in

these equations to be correlated over time, and the plausibility of the null
hypothesis (the constrained version) is evaluated using Learner's Bayesian

version of the standard F—statistic and our own ASER test.

—23—

The physical characteristics used in these equations (in addition to
time and age dummies) are: (1) CID, (2) number of cylinders (abbreviated as
NOC), (3) weight (WT, in pounds), (4) wheelbase x width (WBW, in squared inches)
(5) dummy for number of doors less than 4 (NOD2), (6) dummy for number of
doors greater than 4 (NOD5), (7) AT, (8) PS and (9) AC.

(1) and (2) contri—

bute to speed, (3) and (4) mainly to roominess of a car, (5), (6), and (9)
to the quality of the ride, and (7) and (8) to the ease of driving and
maneuvering.

We tried a number of other variables and variants in preliminary

analyses without affecting the final results significantly. For example,
we tried using length and length times width in addition to the WBW variable
and a WT/WBW variable, a proxy for the sturdiness of a car, instead of the
WT variable, without any noticeable improvement in the results. Because the

effect of H (horsepower) relative to CID appears to have declined over
time,

we have included them both in the early 70's equations. We also

experimented with the inclusion of make dummies (thirteen domestic makes)

to capture the effects of omitted characteristics. While the inclusion of
make dummies did improve the fit, it did not change any of our testing conclusions. To reduce the computational burden we do not consider them further
here.

Table 2 illustrates the types of equations estimated and the kinds of

results obtained. It also shos two problems with these estimates: the
estimated coefficient of the AC (air conditioning) dummy variable is too high.
It implies that cars with air conditioning as standard equipment are on the

average 40 percent more expensive. This is unrealistic and is probably due
to the correlation of AC with some other unmeasured characteristics2 On the

—24—

other hand, the coefficient of WBW

(wheelbase

times width), a proxy for

size, is significantly negative. This too is probably due to its correla—
tion with unmeasured characteristics and multicollinearity with some of the

included ones, such as CID. Because we are interested in detecting substantial changes in the valuation of the set of characteristics as a whole, a
single or even several wrong—signed coefficients do not invalidate our
overall results.

Our first set of results is summarized in Table 3 which presents the
various test statistics for the unconstrained and constrained adjacent period

regressions while excluding the gasoline consumption terms. For such comparisons the conventional critical F—value is about 2.0—2.5 at the one percent
significance level while the Bayesian critical level is between 6.2 (for n
330, K = 39, and q = 18) and 6.9 (for n = 1000, K = 26, q =

9).

Even using

the more conservative Bayesian approach, the coefficients appear to be changing

most of the time. But the impact of these changes on the overall fit of these
equations is rather small. Only in 19730—74A and 1974A —740 do the constraints
cumulatively amount to about .01, and only in 1979A — 790
does

the imposition of the constraint of constancy of coefficients "cost"

more than .01 in terms of LSER.13 Although not significant by our practical

criterion, ASER adds up to .003 and the value of the F—statistic is large in
l977A — 770 and 19779— 78A. Taking all these results together, we would

—25—

have to conclude, having ignored considerations of gasoline efficiency in
these comparisons, that consumers had changed their evaluation of physical
characteristics significantly during this period, especially in 19730 — 74A
and 1979A — 790.
price rises.

These periods were, in fact, periods of rapid gasoline

it is also interesting to note that these changes in relative

evaluation occurred quickly and were over soon after the gasoline price

rises had run their course. In this sense, it appears that consumers adjusted
rather quickly.

So far we examined half—year periods (i.e., April — October comparison

within a year) in order to discern when the estimated characteristics coeffi-

cients had changed significantly. In Table 3A w check also the stability of the
estimated coefficients over longer time periods. While this is only a cursory
check, because different vintages are used at different time
points in the 19740 — 80A comparisons and because these are still only two—

point comparisons, Table 3A tells the same story as Table 3. Except for the
two oil shock periods, the estimated coefficients are stable by our tSER

criterion. 1977A — 78A period shows some instability as in Table 3, but it
is not significant.

We turn next to the estimation of price equations which allow for the

changing cost of gasoline consumption. This is accomplished by adding to
the previous equations the three following terms.

(s/MPG + Age + c AgeIMPG)/P

where P is computed by the three—step iterative procedure described above.

—26—

Table 4 summarizes the results of such computations for the 1975—81 period,
and Table 5 illustrates (for l979A and 0) the type of equation estimated
and the results obtained.

Comparisons of Tables 3 and 4 show that the computed F—values and the

ASERs fall drastically when we take the cost of gasoline into consideration.
There are no substantively significant changes in imputed characteristic prices

in any period by our ASER criterion, although the ASER is still .005
in 1979A—790. Table 5 shows that the imputed price of body size (WBW and WT)

decreased relative to that of engine size (CID). This change is the same
as that observed without consideration of gasoline cost in Table 2..

From

the ex—post point of view consumers may have over—reacted to the second oil
price shock in 1979.

To get comparable estimates for the earlier years of this period we

had to resort to the much smaller Consumer Reports based sample. The results
of these computations are summarized in Tables 6A and 6B. When the gasoline
consumption terms are included there are no significant changes in any period

in Table 6, either on the Bayesian or the ASER criterion.'4
Thus, once the gasoline efficiency variables are added to the standard
hedonic regressions, the hypothesis of constancy of relative imputed prices
of the physical characteristics cannot be rejected for any of the half—year
periods during 1970—81.

So far we tested the constancy of imputed prices, using the framework

associated with equation (17). In (17) the parameters

,

y

and c depend

not only on the price of gasoline but also on other factors such as auto-

mobile prices, the general price level and income. Our third approach to

—27—

the

problem attempts to examine the effect of gasoline price increases

alone, holding the other factors constant. We will do this for our "worst
fit" case, the 1979A — 790 period, following the methods described in

Section II. The sample consists of 1974—77 vintage cars.
To use the "prediction" method we take the unconstrained estimates

for 1979A (from Table 5) and use them to predict the 19790 prices. In
these "predictions" we allow the overall period (price level) and vintage
(age) coefficients to change and concentrate on the differential treatment

of gasoline efficiency variables over time. More specifically we first
form the

"residual price" variable
LLP = log [P19790(x, MPG)] —

(czx.+GA)

where
GA =

[A/MPc +

2AAGE + 3A AGE/NPG]/P79A

is the predicted gasoline cost component based on l979A data and prices, and

then regress it (LLP) on a constant and vintage dummies. The SER of this
regression is .224. This is the most contrained version, one that assumes
that none of the coefficients (except for the constant and vintage dummies)
changed between l979A and 19790.

In the next computation, we allow the C component to change in
proportion to the estimated rise in the price of gasoline during this period,

29.7 percent (based on the gasoline price component of the CPI). Here, the
regression

of

—28—

LLPA =

log

[P19790 (x,NPG)J —

[&x. + (1 + .297)GAI

on a constant and vintage dummies yields an SER of .214.
Alternatively, we need not

assume the expected rate of gasoline

price inflation but can estimate it by regressing

LLPB =

log [P19790 (x, NPG)J cx1

on a constant, vintage dummies, and

GA. The resulting coefficient of GA

is 2.2 with a standard error of .12, significantly larger than the 1.3
implied by the actual gasoline price rise between 1979A and 19790, implying
that some non—negligable fraction of this inflation rate was extrapolated

(perhaps not unreasonably) into the future.

The SER for this regression

is .202.

The fully unconstrained regression for 19790, with all coefficients

allowed to change has an SER of .177. Thus in terms of percentage change
in the unexplained variance due to the imposition of the various constraints,

out of the .0185 change in the residual variance between the constrained
to 1979A coefficients and the unconstrained version, 24 percent can be ex-

plained by allowing the gasoline component to change in proportion to the
actual inflation, and 51 percent if consumers are allowed to extrapolate some

of this inflation into the future. Thus, a significant portion of the change
in estimated coefficients during this period can indeed be associated with
the changes in gasoline prices.'5
We use next the omitted variable approach to look at the same thing

from a different point of view and try to explain the changes that occur

—29—

in

the imputed prices of characteristics when

gasoline cost variables

are omitted from the regressions. First, we take the corresponding coef—
ficients of the unconstrained regression for 1979A from Table 2 and use
them to construct the "residual price" variable

LLP =

where

log

[P19790.] -

EiPiAXIj

are the estimated characteristics coefficients in the 1979A

regression.

We regress this variable on a constant and vintage dummies,

which yields an SER of .228.

Now we calculate . =

is set to 10.17

Then, the alternative "residual

price"

LLPA =

log

is calculated and regressed

—

on a constant and vintage dummies, yielding an

SER of .207.

Here too we need not assume that there was no extrapolation

of the gasoline price rises into the future. Instead, we can iterate on

o in a search for the value that fits best. This occurs at about .9
(rather than .3), indicating a significant extrapolation of current gasoline

price changes into future,and yields an SER of .191.

—30—

All of these estimates are to be compared to the unconstrained
estimates for 19790 whose SER is

.182. Thus, in terms of the difference

in the unexplained variance of 19790 prices between the unconstrained and
the 1979A coefficients version (.0189), 48 percent of it can be explained

by allowing the characteristics coefficients to change in proportion to
their relationship to the left out variable 1/MPG and the observed rise in
gasoline prices (.297), and 82 percent if we use the higher rate of gasoline price inflation extrapolation implied by the data.

For reasons not entirely clear to us, the simpler omitted variable
approach, which focuses on only one variable (1/MPG), gives a greater role
to the gasoline price changes in accounting for the changes that occurred
in the hedonic price equations between 1979A and 19790, than the more com-

plete three—variable "prediction" approach. Both methods yield roughly
similar results, however, with the gasoline price change accounting for
between one quarter to three quarters of the observed change, depending
primarily on whether we allow for an extrapolation of the gasoline price
rises into the future or not.

V. Conclusions
The purpose of this paper was to ask whether U.S. consumers changed
significantly their views about the relative qualities of different cars in

the face of the 1973 and 1979 gasoline price rises. This was done by testing
the null hypothesis that imputed characteristics prices have remained constant

over time. To accomplish this we first outlined a hedonic model that takes
gasoline costs into account, pointed out some of its theoretical implications,

—31—

and discussed the statistical methods required for its estimation and for

the testing of the particular null hypothesis. The model and the estimation methods were then used to analyze the prices of U.S. passenger cars

in the used market during the l97OA — 81A period.
Our main findings are:
(a)

If one does not take gasoline costs into account then one would have to
conclude that consumers changed their relative evaluations of car quali-

ties significantly in 19730—74A, and 1979A—790. They were very quick,
however, in adjusting these evaluations to the oil—price shocks.

(b) When we do take gasoline costs into account, the estimated relative
qualities become much more stable over time and there is no period

that shows a significant change. In this form it is much easier to
maintain the "constancy of tastes" assumption.

(c) Our main model adjusts not only for the effect of gasoline price increases
but also for the effects of other changes such as changes in other prices

and income. We developed models which adjust solely for the increase in
gasoline prices. Applying these models to the 1979A—790 period we observed
that between one and three quarters of the decrease in the unexplained
variance of 19790 prices which arose from allowing characteristics
coefficients to change from those anticipated in 1979A can be explained

by the increase in gasoline prices alone, indicating that this is indeed
a major component of what did happen.

Footnotes

1. Kahn (1981) has also analyzed the effect of gasoline price increase

on used car prices. Our work differs from his in important points. Our
null hypotheses and methods are different. We focus directly on the change
in imputed prices of large, medium and small cars. We use seemingly unre-

lated regression methods and a much larger data set. Nevertheless, this
does not detract from the pioneering merit of his work.

2.

There might be some patriots who made gasoline cost a direct argument

of their utility function: the amount of gasoline used may by itself now

result in disutility. But since scarcity of gasoline is reflected in its
price in a market economy, rational consumers have only to consider the
cost of gasoline in their budget constraint and do not have to make the

amount of gasoline used an argument of the utility function. We assume
that the number of such patriots is small. Consumers may have overreacted
to gasoline price increase, holding an unrealistic expectations of additional

gasoline price rises in the future. In this case, relative quality evaluation among cars may have been influenced more by the energy crises than
our models allow.

3. The relation between the market price and the full price is given by
equation (6) in section II.

4. Economists usually leave it to others (perhaps sociologists and psychologists) to explain how consumer preferences are formed and change. Discussions
of endogeneous taste change are an exception but this is a very restricted

form of change (see Phlips, 1974). As Hirshleifer notes, really great social

changes in human history may have stemmed from shifts in people's goals

for living (that is, preferences), but economists have very little to say
on this topic.

5. Note that we ignore other components of user costs such as repairs, taxes,
and insurance.

6. Alternatively, we could have defined a semi—logarithmic hedonic function
to start out with. That is, equation (6) could have been defined as
ci.x.

P + g = e
log P

1 1

which after several steps would have lead to the form
— g/P

,

which is essentially the same as (17).

7. We will estimate the quality—adjusted full price index in a separate
paper.

8. Also, as stated before in Section II, x and MPG are consumer decision
variables (that is endogenous variables). We do not take this into consideration in the actual regression as in the usual hedonic studies, since from

the point of view of the used car market, the x's and MPG's are predetermined.

9. E.g., see Theil (1971, pp. 548—549).

10. Equation (4.3) of Learner (1978, pp. 88) shows the following relation

between the F—value and the number of observation n for OLS regressions.

F=( 1Ro

q

do not change much

in large samples and hence the F—value increases with n.

11. The information on the 1970—80 vintages was taken from the New England

Edition of the N.A.D.A. Guide. Data on the 1966—69 vintages were taken from
the earlier Ohta—Griliches (1976) study which used the Central Edition of

the same Guide. One should be careful not to confuse Central Edition used

car prices with those of the New England Edition. 1970A and 1971A used car
prices of 1966—69 vintages are Central Edition prices and all other prices

are New England Edition prices, as shown in Appendix Table Al. Our sample
distrihition is shown in that table also.

12. AC is standard equipment on high—priced cars (Cadillac, Imperial, Lincoln). As Ohta—Griliches (1976) show, the make effects (effects of omitted
characteristics on price) of these cars are around .4, which is roughly
equal to the estimated coefficient of AC in this study.

13. We also computed such estimates using three periods at a time, rather
than two, and looked at changes a year apart, rather than just six months
apart, with essentially similar results.

14. The Bayesian critical F—value is between 4.0 and 5.2 for these samples.

15. We did similar calculations for the 19730 — 1974A change with
similar results.

16. Wilcox (1978) used the regression of MPG on physical characteristics
in a different context.
