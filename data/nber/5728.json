    "abstract": "\n\nHigh-quality producers in a vertically differentiated market can reap superior profits by charging higher prices, selling greater quantities, or both.  If qualities are known by consumers and production costs are constant, then having a higher quality secures the producer both higher price and higher quantity; if marginal costs are rising, having a higher quality assures only higher price.  If only some consumers can discern quality but others cannot, then high- and low-quality producers may set a common price, but the high-quality producer will sell more.  In this context, quality begets quantity.  Empirical analyses suggest that in both the mutual fund and automobile industries, high-quality producers sell more units than their low-quality competitors, but at no higher price (or markup) per unit.\n\n",
