Among other things, the multivariate framework lets us evaluate the adequacy of density forecasts involving cross-variable interactions, such as time-varying conditional correlations.  We also provide conditions under which a technique of density forecast forecasts.  Finally by recent advances in financial risk management, we provide a detailed application to multivariate high-frequency exchange rate density forecasts.\n\n",
