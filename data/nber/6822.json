    "abstract": "\n\nResearch over the past several years has led to development of models characterizing equilibrium in a system of local jurisdictions.  An important insight from these models is that plausible single-crossing assumptions about preferences generate strong predictions about the equilibrium distribution of households across communities.  To date predictions have not been subjected to formal empirical tests.  The purpose of this paper is to provide an integrated approach for testing predictions from this class of models.  We first test conditions for locational equilibrium implied by these models.  In particular about the distribution of households by income across communities. We then test the models predictions about the relationships among locational equilibrium conditions and housing prices.  By drawing inferences from a structural general equilibrium model approach of this paper offers a unified treatment of theory and empirical testing.\n\n",
