Where (a) income distributional effects of policies are large and (b) one cannot take for granted compensating adjustment in other policy instruments affecting distribution, simple aggregation of gains and losses is unlikely to provide a convincing basis for action, as an ethical matter, or predictor of policy, as a political matter.\n\n",
