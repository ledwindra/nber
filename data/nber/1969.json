    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper shows that the existing estimates of prewar gross national\nproduct exaggerate the size of cyclical fluctuations. The source of the\nexaggeration is that the original Kuznets estimates are based on the\nassumption that GNP moves one-for-one with commodity output valued at\nproducer prices. New estimates of GNP for 1869-1918 are derived using the\nestimated aggregate relationship between GNP and commodity output for the\ninterwar and postwar eras. The new estimates of GNP indicate that the\nbusiness cycle is only slightly more severe in the pre-Worid War I era than in the post-World War II era.\n\n",
