    "abstract": "\n\nThis study utilizes data from a number of sources to estimate how lawyers' starting salaries relate to their ability, the quality of law school they attended, and whether the law school was a private institution. Based upon this analysis, a benefit-cost analysis is conducted of the value of attending a high-quality private institution. Analyses are also done of how the financial attractiveness of law vis-a- vis other careers has changed in recent years and a conceptual framework discussed for law schools to use in allocating their financial aid resources.\n\n",
