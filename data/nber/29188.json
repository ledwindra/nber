    "abstract": "\n\nWe investigate how material well-being has changed over time for single mother headed families\u2014the primary group affected by welfare reform and other policy changes of the 1990s. We focus on consumption as well as other indicators including components of consumption, measures of housing quality, and health insurance coverage. The results provide strong evidence that the material circumstances of single mothers improved in the decades following welfare reform. The consumption of the most disadvantaged single mother headed families\u2014those with low consumption or low education\u2014rose noticeably over time and at a faster rate than for those in comparison groups.\n\n",
