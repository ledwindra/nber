Topel's use of a wage and a tenure that refer to different years, his use of the Current Population Survey to detrend the PSID, and differences between Altonji and Shakotko's estimator and Topel's estimator explain the fact that Topel obtains much larger estimates.  The evidence from the data used by AS and Topel points to an effect of ten years of tenure on the log wage equal to .11, which is above AS's preferred estimate of .066 but far below Topel's estimate.  However, this estimate is probably biased upward by the wage measure used in all three studies.  We also obtain a modest estimate of the return to seniority using data for 1983-1991.\n\n",
