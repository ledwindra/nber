fails to explain the short run movements in real exchange rates, and figure 1 suggests that there
may also be problems in explaining the long run movements, especially where the U, S. dollar is
concerned.

Relative traded goods productivity has risen much faster in the United States than in

Germany, especially since the mid- 1970s. This shodd have led to a real appreciation of the dollar
(a fill in the real exchange rate as plotted in figure 1); instead, the dollar has depreciated.

Each of these innovations may need some elaboration.
We use the average product of labor instead of TFP for four reasons: ( 1) The almost
exclusive focus on ~

in the recent literature reflects (at least in part) an interest in assessrng the

relative importance of supply shocks (as proxied by TFP) and demand shocks (as proxied by
government expenditures, etc. ) in explaining real exchange rate movements.

Interpreting

movements in Solow residuals as exogenous supply shocks is problematic in and of itse~4 and m
any event we think that this is a case of putting the cart before the horse. We do not need to take
a stand on the relative importance of supply and demand shocks to test the first corrrponent of the

3 Although Marwon ( 1987) and others have used average labor productivity, most of the
recent literature has focused on total factor productfity computed from a Cobb-Douglass
production fimction. See, in particular, Chinn (1995), Chinn and Johnston ( 1996), De Gregorio,
Giovannini and Krueger ( 1993), De Gregorio, Giovannini and WOM( 1993), and Froot ad Rogoff

concluding remarks.

2, The Analvtic al Framework
We begin with the link between the relative price ofnontraded

goods and the relative

productivities in the traded and nontraded goods sectors. The analytical framework we use is
quite general; it codd be embedded in a wide class of models. In each country, capital and labor
are employed m the production of traded goods, T, and non-traded goods, N. Competition
implies that labor is paid the value of its marginal product, and labor mobility implies that the
nominal wage rate, W, is equal m the two sectors.

Although the model described above does not distinguish short-run and long-run fluctuations, in
our empirical tests we interpret equation (5) as a restriction on the long-run trends in the relative
price ofnon-traded

The interesting question is whether purchasing power parity holds in the long run for traded
goods. As is we~ Imown, it fails dramatically in the short run. We therefore test whether h(EL,)
is cointegrated with ln(r,,), and whether the cointegrating slope is unity.

3, A Brief Review of the Econometric Methods
Because the tess that we consider focus on the long-run or trend behavior of the relative
prices, relative productivities

and nominal and PPP exchange rates, we begin by examining the

long-run or trend behavior of each of the series and then test the restrictions that the hypotheses
.
imply on that long-run behavior.

In all of the tests that we implement, we allow the short-run

dynamics to be relatively unconstrained and focus only on the long-run behavior of the data.
Before proceeding, we ask whether each of the series is better characterized by stationary
deviations from a deterministic trend or by stochastic trends, or possibly by both a deterministic
and stochastic trend. We therefore consider a univariate autoregression for each series,

and carry out three tests. The fist is an augmented Dickey FWer (1979) t-test of the hypothesis
that pi= 1. We allow the data to determine the number of lags, &, using the general-to-specific
procedures suggested by Hall ( 1994) and Ng and Perron ( 1995). The other two tests, proposed
by Phillips and Perron ( 1988), set ~ = O when estimating p and ad@st the test statistics using ~

but its expected value is negative and larger m absolute value. And once we include time the
average t-ratio is essentially equal to its expected value.

13

Because the data may contain deterministic as well as stochastic trends, we also carry out
the unit root tests including a time trend. The panel tests of a unit root again yield no evidence
against the null. We also carry out an F-test of the nti that pi = 1 and the trend coefficient is zero
for each count~

and find evidence of a deterministic trend for Denmark and possibly for Canada.

Interestingly, once a time trend is included in the regression for Denmark the evidence against a
unit root disappears.

On the other hand, when a time trend is included m the regression for

Canada, we reject the null of a unit root.
Table 2 contains the unit root tests for relative productivities.

Again, we tid little

evidence against the n~ hypothesis of a unit root. Regardless of whether we include common
time dummies, the panel tests do not come close to rejecting a unit root at conventional
significance levels. Among the individual regressions, only for Japan do we reject a unit root and

The country-

F-tests point to evidence of deterministic trends in the regressions for Japan, Great

And when we inchde a deterministic trend, we can reject a unit root in the

The evidence points overwhelmingly to unit roots m both relative productivities

and the

We therefore proceed assuming that both the nominal exchange rate and the PPP exchange rate
for all countries in our panel contain a stochastic trend but no deterministic trend. Now that the
preliminary testing is completed, we turn to the hypotheses of interest,

of no cointegration at the 5 percent level with all three tests, but when common

time dummies are inckded only the t-tests yield rejections.
Because there is some evidence that deterministic trends might be in the data for some of
the countries, we also carry out the panel corntegration tests rncluding a time trend in the
cointegrating regression.

The evidence from these tests is not as strong, but, because only some

of the series may have deterministic trends and because the critical values with deterministic
trends are higher than those without deterministic trends, the tests are probably overly

The evidence is weake~ when we include common time dummies. When we

exclude the 3 countries (Canada, Great Britain, and Austria) for which the data may not fit the
stochastic assumptions that the test rely on, we reject at the

5%

level for one of the three tests.

We conclude from table 5 that the relative prices of nontraded goods and the relative
productivities in the traded and nontraded goods sectors are cointegrated as the BalassaSamuelson model predicts.

In tables 6 and 7 we turn to the stronger predictions of the Balassa-

Samuelson model that the slope in the cointegrating relationship is 1.0. In table 6 we test this
implication of the model by testing the nd hypothesis that there is a unit root in the ~erence
between the (log) relative price and the (log) relative productivities,

Once again the evidence is

mixed when we look at the tests carried out on the data for each country individually.

We reject

the null hypothesis of a unit root in the difference at the 5 percent level for 5 of the 13 countries
and at the 10 percent level for one additional country. Once again, however, the gain in power
from using joint tests in a panel is clear. We reject the n~ hypothesis of a unit root at the 5
percent level for all three groups of countries that we consider. The evidence horn the tests
without a time trend is clearly consistent with the hWothesis that the slope of the cointegrating
relationship is 1.0, or, alternatively, that the relative price of nontraded goods is proportional to
the relative productivities

in the traded and nontraded goods sectors.

Inckding a time trend again weakens the evidence against the nd hypothesis of a unit
root. When time common dummies are included, we reject the nd hypothesis of a unit root in

can reject the null hypothesis that the slope is 1.0 at the 5 percent level for 9 of the 13 countries.
The panel tests cob

these results. When we include common time dummies we obtain at-

ratio for the null that ~ = 1.0 of around -8.0 when we use all of the countries in the sample or
when we exckde the three countries for which the series are most likely to violate the
assumptions about the stochastic trends,
The results of the formal tests are reflected in figure 2 where we plot the (log of the)
relative price of nontraded goods and the (log of the) relative labor produtiivities

in traded and

nontraded goods for four countries, Germany, Japan, It sly, and the United States. The two series
are normalized so that 1970 = O for each country, The ~erences

between the two series

generally appear to be transitory although the data for the United States and Italy exhibit a
tendency common to many of the countries we examine for the relative productivities to grow by
more than the relative price. This tendency is reflected in the slope estimates, which are generally
less than one.

In order to explore whether small sample

First we ve@ that the FMOLS estimates perform

well even in samples of 25 observations when ~ and ~ are independent and identically distributed.
Then we choose three countries: one (the United States) with a slope estimate of around 0.9, one
(Belgium) with a slope estimate of around 0.8, and one (Denmark) with a slope estimate around
0.6. For each of the countries we estimate a VAR for q=(~, ()’ and use the parameters and error
covanance matrix to generate 15,000 samples of 25 observations in which the true value of ~ is
set to 1.0. We also examine the small sample properties of the pooled tests statistics from the
corresponding

1,000 samples of 15 countries and 25 observations.

In all three cases we fmd that the FMOLS estimate of the slope is biased and that using the
asymptotic distribution wodd lead to rejecting the null hypothesis of ~= 1.0 too frequently.

The

mean FMOLS estimates of ~ are: 0.90 when we use the U.S. parameters, 0.77 when we use the
Belgian parameters, and 0.86 when we use the Danish parameters.

Thus for two of the three we

find that our point estimate from table 7 is roughly equal to the mean vake estimated from the
Monte Carlos in which the true value of ~ is unity. The point estimate in table 7 computed from
the Danish data (O.54) is below the average for the third and is significantly different from 1.0 at

18

the 5 percent level even using the empirical distribution from the Monte Carlo experiments.
The tendency for the FMOLS estimates to reject the nd

of ~ = 1.0 too frequently and the

downward bias in the estimate of ~ is also reflected in the panel test statistics. As is the case with
the individual country tests, the panel tests (especidy

the group mean test) reject too frequently.

When the U, S. parameters are used to generate the data and all countries are used, the 95 percent
critical value from the Monte Carlos is below the value reported m table 7 for all countries.

The

critical values computed from the Monte Carlos using the other two sets of parameters all exceed
the test statistics reported in table 7.
The Monte Carlo evidence suggest that one wotid tend to Iind slope estimates below 1,0
(relative productivity changes outstripping relative price changes) even if the true slope was, in
fact, 1.0. Thus the test statistics reported in table 7 should probably not be taken as evidence
against the nti h~othesis

13This rejection might appear surprising given the tiihue to reject the null of no

rejection becomes clearer in the next section when we change numeraire currencies. Because
changing the numeraire amounts to adding the same log exchange rate to each cross-sectional
unit, it ti have no impact on tests computed usrng deviations from cross-section means, at least
for large N. As can be seen by comparing the resldts in tables 8 and 12, with N= 12, a change of
nmeraire retits in ody minimal changes to the test statistics. See O’Connell ( 1996).

Contrary to the predictions of purchasing power parity in traded goods, the slope of the
cointegrating relationship appears not to be 1.0.
In table 10 we present estimates of the slopes of the cointegrating relationships along with
tests of the hypothesis that the slope is 1.0. Consistent with the results in table 9, we find that we
reject the null hypothesis that the slope is 1.0 for 10 of the 12 countries and the panel test strongly
reject the null hypothesis that the slopes are jointly equal to one.

We also found a large number

of rejections of the null when we looked at the cointegrating slopes for relative prices and relative
productivities, but the reason for the large number of rejections is quite ~erent

here. There the

rejections arise because the slope estimates, which are fairly close to 1,0, are precisely estimated.
In contrast, here the point estimates are all far from 1.0 and we reject the nfl despite fairly large
standard errors. The wide range of point estimates that we report in table 10 is roughly consistent
with previous work that has looked at purchasing power parity. In their survey, Froot and Rogoff
(1995) repoti that it is common in the literature to find slopes that vary widely across countries
and are frequently far from the value of 1.0 that is implied by purchasing power parity.
4.4 Pure hasinz Power Paritv in Traded Goods :DMast

Do the results on purchasing power parity in traded goods depend on the choice of the
U, S. dollar as the numeraire currency?14 In order to shed some light on this question,

we now

reconsider our tests using the DM as the numeraire currency. In table 11 we present the redts

‘4Two pieces of existing evidence suggest that it might. Papell ( 1995) tests the null
hypothesis of a unit root in real exchange rates computed with consumer prices and fids stronger
rejections when the DM is used as the reference currency than when the dollar is used as the
reference currency. Similarly, Jorion and Sweeney (1994) find stronger evidence that real
exchange rates are mean reverting when the DM is used as the numeraire. On the other hand,
Wei and Parsley ( 1995) use prices in 12 tradable sectors and fmd that rates of convergence to
purchasing power parity are similar when the DM and the U, S. dollar are used as the numeraire.

We present the results of these unit root tests in Table 12 and find fairly strong

evidence against the nti hypothesis of a unit root in the difference, We reject the null hypothesis
with at least two of the three tests for five of the twelve countries taken individually and with one
of the tests for a sixth country.

The joint tests yield rejections at the 95°/0 level or greater.

Next we estimate the cointegrating slope and report the results in table 13. These resuks
provide an interesting contrast to those obtained using the U. S. dollar as the numeraire currency,
Although we reject the null hypothesis that the slope is 1.0 for tie of the twelve currencies, the

of a unit root in PPP exchange rates. We also reject the m.dl of a unit root in the PPP exchange

for which we reject the null hypothesis of a unit slope,

the point estimates are closer to one than are any of the slopes we obtain using the dollar as the
numeraire,
The results we report in tables 11-13

lend somewhat favorable support for the h~othetis

of purchasing power parity in traded goods when the DM is the numeraire currency. Nominal
exchange rates and PPP exchange rates appear to be cointegrated and, although we can fiequentb
reject that the two are proportional in the long run, our estimates suggest that they are nearly
proportional for the currencies we consider. Interestin@y, the evidence does not indicate that
purchasing power parity in traded goods is any more likely to hold for European currencies than
for non-European

currencies relative to the DM.

h figure 3 we plot the (logs of the) nominal and PPP exchange rates for the DM and yen
relative to the U, S. dollar and the lira and yen relative to the DM. Agarn, each series is
normalized so that 1970 = O. Large and long-lasting deviations from PPP m traded goods are
evident for both exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. As is consistent with the formal tests,
these deviations are smaller and less persistent when we examine the two exchange rates relative
to the DM.

5. Concluti~

Remarks

How well does the Balassa-Samuelson

model explain the behavior of real exchange rates?

16me one notable exception is the Belgian franc regression where we obtain a negative
point estimate and a large standard error. Recall that we rejected the m.dl hypothesis of a unit
root in the Belgian franc - DM PPP exchange rate but not for the nominal exchange rate. The
two therefore cannot be cointegrated so that the estimate is not particularly bothersome. The
slope for the U.S. dollar - DM exchange rate is, of course, identical to that reported in table 10.
23

The evidence from a panel of 13 OECD countries supports the h~othesis
ofnontraded

that the relative price

goods reflects the relative labor productivities in the traded and nontraded goods

sectors. The results suggest that the relative prices of nontraded goods and the relative
productivities in the traded and nontraded goods sectors are corntegrated and that the slope of the
cointegrating relationship is generally close to 1.0. For some comtries, groti

m relative

productivities appears to outstrip growth in relative prices (or equivalently the slope is less than
1.0), but Monte Carlo evidence suggests that this tierence

is within the range of sampling

variation in a sample like ours. Thus relative prices and relative produtities

appear to be

proportional in the long run.
But the Balassa-Samuelson

model also assumes that traded goods prices are characterized

by purchasing power parity. As is consistent with the evidence presented in Engel ( 1995), we find
large and long-wed

deviations from PPP in traded goods when we look at U.S. dollar exchange

rates. Although nominal exchange rates and PPP exchange rates appear to be cointegrated we
fid that the slopes of the cointegrating regressions differ vary widely and ~er

substantially from

one. But when we examine DM exchange rates the evidence is considerably more favorable to
purchasing power parity in traded goods. Nominal and PPP exchange rates appear to be
cointegrated and the slopes of the cointegrating regressions are much closer to one than is the
case with U.S. dollar exchange rates. This evidence suggests that Engel’s results may well be
sensitive to the choice of numeraire currency. hterestin~,

apart from the U.S. dollar - DM

exchange rates, purchasing power parity does not appear to be a better characterization

THE DATA

Nominal exchange rates are from International Financial Statistics.
productivity data for Belgi~

Sectoral price and

Canada, Denmark, Great Britain, Firdand, France, Germany, Italy,

Japan, Sweden, and the US come from the OECD National Accounts.

Price and productivity

data for Austria and Spain come from national statistics. (Francisco de Castro of the Bank of
Spain coflected and documented the data, ) These sources provide annual sectoral data on
nominal value added, real value added and number of employees.

The traded sector is made up of

the “manufacturing” sector and the “agricdture, hunting forestry and fishing” sector. The nontraded sector is made up of the “wholesale and retail trade, restaurants and hotels” sector, the
“trmsport, storage and commtication”
setices”

sector, the “finance, insurance, real estate and business

sector, the “community social and personal services” sector, and the “non-market

services” sector; the “non-market services” sector is made up of the “producers of government
services” subsector and the “other producers” subsector.
Data consistency is always an issue, We are aware of the foflowing anomahes in the
OECD data: (1) The German market services emplo~mt

figures do not include the “real estate

and business services” sector; value added figures do. (2) The Italian, British and Belgian value
added and emplo~ent

figures do not include “real estate and busrness services” sector. (3)

BritiA value added and employmmt figures consist of the “producers of government setices”
sector; they do not rnclude the “other producers” sector.
