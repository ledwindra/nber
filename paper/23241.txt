The Impact of Public and Private Research Support on Premature Cancer Mortality and Hospitalization
in the U.S., 1999-2013

ABSTRACT
We use data from PubMed and other sources to examine the impact of public and private research
support on premature (before ages 75, 65, and 55) cancer mortality and hospitalization, by
estimating difference-in-differences models based on longitudinal, cancer-site-level data on about
30 cancer sites.
The estimates indicate that cancer sites about which more research-supported articles were
published since the 1970s had larger reductions in premature mortality and hospitalization during
the period 1999-2013, controlling for the change in the number of people diagnosed. Cancer sites
for which more non-research-supported articles were published did not have larger reductions in
premature mortality or hospitalization.
The research support that contributed to articles published during 1987-2001 reduced premature
(before age 75) mortality at an average annual rate of 0.9% during the period 1999-2013, and it
reduced the number of years of potential life lost before age 75 due to cancer in 2013 by 566
thousand. The research support that contributed to articles published during 1984-1998 reduced
hospital discharges at an average annual rate of 4.1% during the period 1999-2013, and it reduced
the number of hospital discharges due to cancer in 2013 by 566 thousand.

Introduction
In a previous study, Lichtenberg (2013) used PubMed 1 data on the number of

publications about different types of cancer (breast, colon, lung, etc.) to provide evidence about
the impact of biomedical research on U.S. cancer mortality rates. 2 Estimates from that study
indicated that mortality rates: (1) are unrelated to the (current or lagged) stock of publications
that had not received research funding; (2) are only weakly inversely related to the
contemporaneous stock of published articles that received research funding; and (3) are strongly
inversely related to the stock of articles that had received research funding and been published 5
and 10 years earlier.
In this paper, we will extend and update the analysis performed in Lichtenberg (2013) in
a number of important respects:
•

The sole outcome measure analyzed in the previous study was the age-adjusted mortality
rate. In this paper, we will analyze a different type of mortality measure: years of
potential life lost (YPLL) before three ages (75, 65, and 55). 3 Estimates of YPLL models
(but not of age-adjusted mortality rate models) enable us to calculate the number of lifeyears gained from biomedical research.

•

In addition to analyzing the impact of biomedical research on premature cancer mortality,
we will analyze its effect on hospitalization (the number of inpatient hospital discharges
and days of care) due to cancer. Hospital care was the largest single component of U.S.
medical expenditure in 2014, accounting for 32% of total expenditure (Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services (2017)).

PubMed comprises over 26 million citations for biomedical literature from MEDLINE, life science journals, and
online books. PubMed citations and abstracts include the fields of biomedicine and health, covering portions of the
life sciences, behavioral sciences, chemical sciences, and bioengineering. PubMed also provides access to additional
relevant web sites and links to the other NCBI molecular biology resources. PubMed is a free resource that is
developed and maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), at the U.S. National
Library of Medicine (NLM), located at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
2
Previous research on the agricultural (Evenson and Kislev (1973)) and manufacturing (Adams (1990)) sectors of
the economy had found that counts of publications are useful indicators of the stock of knowledge.
3
Previous authors have argued that “reducing premature mortality is a crucial public health objective” (Renard,
Tafforeau, and Deboosere (2014)). A widely used measure of premature mortality is years of potential life lost
(YPLL) before a given age (e.g. age 75), i.e. the number of years not lived by an individual who died before that age
(Association of Public Health Epidemiologists in Ontario (2015)). Statistics of YPLL are published by the World
Health Organization, the OECD, and government agencies of the U.S., Switzerland, and other countries. Burnet et
al (2005) argue that YPLL “should be considered when allocating research funds.”

•

The previous study controlled for changes in incidence by including just the
contemporaneous age-adjusted incidence rate (in year t) in the age-adjusted mortality
model. In this paper, we will control for the average annual number of patients
diagnosed in years t-9 to t in the premature mortality and hospitalization models.

•

In the previous study, all publications in which a specific type of cancer was a topic were
included. In this paper, only publications in which a specific type of cancer was one of
the main topics are included. 4

•

In the previous study, the maximum allowed lag from publication to mortality was 10
years. In this paper, we allow for lags of up to 24 years.

•

The functional form specified in the previous study was log-log. In this paper, we will
estimate semi-logarithmic models. Comparison of the marginal effects of research-based
and non-research-based publications is more straightforward in the semi-logarithmic
model.

•

In the previous study, the sample period was 1995-2009. This paper will analyze a more
recent period: 1999-2013.
In the next section of this paper, we describe the econometric model of premature

mortality and hospitalization that we will estimate. In Section III, we describe the data sources
we rely upon to construct the dataset used to estimate the model and present descriptive
statistics; all of the data are publicly available. Estimates of the models are presented in Section
IV. Implications of the estimates are discussed in Section V. Section VI contains a summary
and conclusions.
II.

Econometric model of premature mortality and hospitalization
To assess the impact of biomedical research on premature cancer mortality and

hospitalization, I will estimate the following difference-in-differences model based on
longitudinal, cancer-site-level data on about 30 cancer sites:

As of 4 March 2017, “breast neoplasms” was a topic in 247,546 publications, and was a “main topic” in 207,485
publications; “colonic neoplasms” was a topic in 67,435 publications, and was a “main topic” in 49,940
publications.

ln(Yst) = βresearch CUM_RESEARCH_PUBSs,t-k + βother CUM_OTHER_PUBSs,t-k
+ γ ln(CASES_10_YEARSst) + αs + δt + εst

(1)

where Yst is one of the following variables:
YPLL75st = the number of years of potential life lost before age 75 from cancer at site
s (s = 1,…,30) in year t (t=1999,…,2013)
YPLL65st = the number of years of potential life lost before age 65 from cancer at site
s in year t
YPLL55st = the number of years of potential life lost before age 55 from cancer at site
s in year t
DISCHARGESst = the number of inpatient hospital discharges in year t for which the
principal diagnosis was cancer at site s
HOSP_DAYSst = the number of days of inpatient hospital care in year t for which the
principal diagnosis was cancer at site s
and
CUM_RESEARCH_PUBSs,t-k = the number of PubMed articles published by the end of
year t–k (k = 0, 3, 6,…,24) that had cancer at site s as a
“main topic” and that mentioned U.S. Government and/or
non-U.S. Government research support 5
CUM_OTHER_PUBSs,t-k = the number of PubMed articles published by the end of
year t–k that had cancer at site s as a “main topic” and that
did not mention either U.S. Government or non-U.S.
Government research support
CASES_10_YEARSst = the average annual number of patients diagnosed with
cancer at site s in SEER 9 registries in years t-9 to t
αs = a fixed effect for cancer at site s
δt = a fixed effect for year t

5
Disentangling the effects of U.S. Government and non-U.S. Government research support is difficult. As shown in
Lichtenberg (2013), almost half of the publications that cite U.S. Government research support also cite non-U.S.
Government research support. Non-U.S. government financial support includes support by American societies,
institutes, state governments, universities, and private organizations, and by foreign sources (national, departmental,
provincial, academic & private organizations).

6
εst = a disturbance
The fixed year effects control for time-varying factors that influence cancer mortality and
hospitalization in general. The models will be estimated by weighted least squares, weighting by
(1 / 15) ΣtYst. Disturbances will be clustered within cancer sites.
III.

Data sources and descriptive statistics

Premature mortality data. Data on the number of years of potential life lost before ages 75, 65,
and 55, by cancer site and year, were constructed from data contained in the WHO Mortality
Database. Data for 1999 and 2013 are shown in Table 1. Figure 1 shows data on the number of
years of potential life lost before age 75 in 1999 and 2013 for 4 cancer sites that had roughly
similar numbers (between 141 and 196 thousand) of YPLL75 in 1999. The 1999-2013 change in
YPLL75 varied considerably across these 4 cancer sites.
Hospitalization data. Data on the number of inpatient hospital discharges and days of care, by
cancer site and year, were constructed from data contained in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization
Project (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (2017)). The number of days of care was
computed as the number of discharges times average length of stay. Data for 1999 and 2013 are
shown in Table 2.
Research-based and other publications. Data on CUM_RESEARCH_PUBS and
CUM_OTHER_PUBS, by cancer site and year, were constructed by performing searches on the
PubMed Advanced Search Builder. As shown in Appendix Table 1, this tool allows the user to
download data on the number of results (publications) by year after performing a search. We
used the diseases branch (D) of the MeSH Tree to determine appropriate search terms (cancer
site definitions). A publication was included in CUM_RESEARCH_PUBS if it had any one of
the following “Publication Types”: Research Support, American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural; Research
Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U. S. Gov’t; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, NonP.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. Data for 1999 and 2013 are shown in Table 3.
Figure 2 shows data on the cumulative number of research-supported publications in 1989, 2001,
and 2013 for 4 cancer sites that had similar numbers (between 4261 and 4678) of research-

7
supported publications in 1989. The number of research-supported articles published during
1990-2013 varied considerably across these 4 cancer sites.
Incidence data. Data on the number of people diagnosed in SEER 9 registries, by cancer site and
year, were obtained from the National Cancer Institute’s SEER*Stat Software. Data for 1999
and 2013 are shown in Table 4.

IV.

Empirical results
Estimates of parameters of premature mortality models (eq. (1), where Y = YPLL75,

YPLL65, or YPLL55) are shown in Table 5. Each row of the table represents a separate model,
corresponding to a different dependent variable and assumed lag length (k) from publications to
premature mortality. CUM_RESEARCH_PUBS and CUM_OTHER_PUBS are both measured
in thousands.
In lines 1-9, the dependent variable is ln(YPLL75), and k = 0, 3, 6, …, 24, respectively.
As shown in lines 1-3, βresearch is negative but not statistically significant when k < 6. However,
as shown in lines 4-6, βresearch is negative and statistically significant (p-value < .05) when 9 < k
< 15. This indicates that premature (before age 75) mortality is inversely related to the number
of research-supported articles that had been published 9-15 years earlier, controlling for the
number of other articles that had been published 9-15 years earlier and for the average annual
number of patients diagnosed in SEER 9 registries in the previous 10 years. The estimate in line
5 implies that 1000 additional research-supported publications is associated with a 1.3%
YPLL75 reduction 12 years later. The point estimates of βresearch when 18 < k < 24 are similar to
the point estimates when 9 < k < 15, but the standard errors are much larger when 18 < k < 24, so
those estimates are not statistically significant. 6

The estimates of βresearch for 0 < k < 24 from

ln(YPLL75) models are shown (on an inverted scale) in Figure 3.
None of the estimates of βother in lines 1-9 are statistically significant: premature (before
age 75) mortality is unrelated to the number of publications that did not mention either U.S.
Government or non-U.S. Government research support. All of the estimates of γ in lines 1-9 are
The large standard errors may be attributable, to an important extent, to left-censoring of the data on researchsupported articles: PubMed did not record information about research support until 1975 (National Library of
Medicine (2017)).

statistically significant: YPLL75 is significantly positively related to the number of people
diagnosed in the previous 10 years.
In lines 10-18 of Table 5, the dependent variable is ln(YPLL65). These estimates are
quite similar to the estimates in lines 1-9. PYLL65 is inversely related to the number of
research-supported articles that had been published 12-15 years earlier, and is unrelated to the
number of other articles. It is also unrelated to the number of people diagnosed in the previous
10 years, presumably because about half of cancer patients are diagnosed after the age of 65. 7
In lines 19-27 of Table 5, the dependent variable is ln(YPLL55).

The estimates of

βresearch for 0 < k < 24 from ln(YPLL55) models are shown in Figure 4. The point estimates of
βresearch are strictly increasing with respect to lag length. The estimates for 0 < k < 15 are not
statistically significant, but the estimates for 18 < k < 24 are statistically significant. This
indicates that the number of years of potential life lost before age 55 is inversely related to the
number of research-supported articles that had been published 18-24 years earlier, and that 1000
additional research-supported publications is associated with a 4.2% YPLL55 reduction 24 years
later. Evidently, the lag from research-supported publications to premature mortality reduction is
considerably longer for YPLL55 than it is for YPLL75.
Estimates of parameters of hospitalization models (eq. (1), where Y = DISCHARGES or
HOSP_DAYS) are shown in Table 6. In lines 1-9, the dependent variable is ln(DISCHARGES).
The estimates of βresearch for 0 < k < 24 from ln(DISCHARGES) models are shown in Figure 5.
For all values of k, the estimate is negative and statistically significant. Once again, the point
estimates of βresearch are strictly increasing with respect to lag length. The estimate of βresearch in
line 9 of Table 6 indicates that 1000 additional research-supported publications is associated with
a 10% DISCHARGES reduction 24 years later. The estimates in lines 1-9 indicate that the
number of hospital discharges is significantly positively related to the number of people
diagnosed in the previous 10 years, as expected. The estimates also indicate that the number of
hospital discharges is also significantly positively related to the number of other (non-researchsupported) publications, which is somewhat surprising. However, the magnitudes of the βother
coefficients are much smaller than the magnitudes of the βresearch coefficients: the estimate of

9
βother in line 9 indicates that 1000 additional non-research-supported publications is associated
with only a 1.6% DISCHARGES increase 24 years later.
In lines 10-18, the dependent variable is ln(HOSP_DAYS). Estimates of the parameters
of HOSP_DAYS models are quite similar to estimates of the parameters of DISCHARGES
models.
V.

Discussion
The estimates of eq. (1) indicate that cancer sites about which more research-supported

articles were published since the 1970s had larger reductions in premature mortality and
hospitalization during the period 1999-2013, controlling for the change in the number of people
diagnosed. Cancer sites for which more non-research-supported articles were published did not
have larger reductions in premature mortality or hospitalization.
We can use the estimates to calculate the reduction in premature mortality in 2013
attributable to previous publication of research-supported articles. Lines 1-9 of Table 5 indicate
that YPLL75st is most strongly inversely correlated with CUM_RESEARCH_PUBSs,t-12. The
weighted (by (1 / 15) Σt YPLL75st) mean 1999-2013 increase in CUM_RESEARCH_PUBSs,t-12
was 9.01 (= 12.13 – 3.11). The estimate of βresearch in the YPLL75 model when k = 12 is -0.013,
so we estimate that, if no research-supported articles had been published during the period 19872001, the number of years of potential life lost before age 75 due to cancer in 2013 would have
been 12.8% (= exp(0.013 * 9.01) – 1) higher. Since previous research reduced YPLL75 by
12.8% over a 14-year period, it reduced premature mortality at an average annual rate of 0.9% (=
12.8% / 14). According to the Centers for Disease Control (2017), 4407 thousand years of
potential life were lost before age 75 due to cancer in 2013, so we estimate that, if no researchsupported articles had been published during the period 1987-2001, the number of years of
potential life lost before age 75 due to cancer in 2013 would have been 566 thousand (= 12.8% *
4407 thousand) higher.
We can also use the estimates to calculate the reduction in hospital discharges in 2013
attributable to previous publication of research-supported articles. Lines 1-9 of Table 6 indicate
that DISCHARGESst is most strongly inversely correlated with CUM_RESEARCH_PUBSs,t-15.
The weighted (by (1 / 15) Σt DISCHARGESst) mean 1999-2013 increase in

10
CUM_RESEARCH_PUBSs,t-15 was 7.31 (= 9.17 – 1.86). The estimate of βresearch in the
DISCHARGES model when k = 15 is -0.062, so we estimate that, if no research-supported
articles had been published during the period 1984-1998, the number of hospital discharges due
to cancer in 2013 would have been 57.0% (= exp(0.062 * 7.31) – 1) higher. Since previous
research reduced DISCHARGES by 57.0% over a 14-year period, it reduced hospital discharges
at an average annual rate of 4.1% (= 57.0% / 14). According to HCUPnet (2017), there were
1082 thousand hospitalizations due to cancer in 2013, so we estimate that, if no researchsupported articles had been published during the period 1984-1998, the number of hospital
discharges due to cancer in 2013 would have been 566 thousand (= 57.0% * 1082 thousand)
higher.
VI.

Summary and conclusions
A previous study used PubMed data on the number of publications about different types

of cancer (breast, colon, lung, etc.) to provide evidence about the impact of biomedical research
on U.S. cancer mortality rates. In this paper, we extended and updated the analysis performed in
the earlier study in several important respects: we analyzed a different type of mortality measure
(years of potential life lost (YPLL) before three ages (75, 65, and 55)); we analyzed the effect of
research-supported publications on hospitalization as well as on mortality; we controlled for
lagged as well as current cancer incidence; and we allowed for longer (24 years vs. 10 years) lags
from publication to cancer outcomes.
To assess the impact of biomedical research on premature cancer mortality and
hospitalization, we estimated difference-in-differences models based on longitudinal, cancer-sitelevel data on about 30 cancer sites. The estimates indicated that cancer sites about which more
research-supported articles were published since the 1970s had larger reductions in premature
mortality and hospitalization during the period 1999-2013, controlling for the change in the
number of people diagnosed. Cancer sites for which more non-research-supported articles were
published did not have larger reductions in premature mortality or hospitalization.
Premature (before age 75) mortality is inversely related to the number of researchsupported articles that had been published 9-15 years earlier, controlling for the number of other
articles that had been published 9-15 years earlier and for the average annual number of patients
diagnosed in SEER 9 registries in the previous 10 years. The estimates indicated that 1000

11
additional research-supported publications is associated with a 1.3% YPLL75 reduction 12 years
later. Estimates of models of YPLL65 were quite similar to estimates of models of YPLL75.
YPLL65 is inversely related to the number of research-supported articles that had been published
12-15 years earlier, and is unrelated to the number of other articles.
The number of years of potential life lost before age 55 is inversely related to the number
of research-supported articles that had been published 18-24 years earlier; 1000 additional
research-supported publications is associated with a 4.2% YPLL55 reduction 24 years later.
Evidently, the lag from research-supported publications to premature mortality reduction is
considerably longer for YPLL55 than it is for YPLL75.
The number of hospital discharges attributed to cancer is significantly inversely related to
the number of research-supported articles at every lag length investigated (from 0 to 24 years),
but the magnitude of the effect is strictly increasing with respect to lag length. The estimates
indicated that 1000 additional research-supported publications is associated with a 10%
reduction in hospital discharges 24 years later.
The research support that contributed to articles published during 1987-2001 reduced
premature (before age 75) mortality at an average annual rate of 0.9% during the period 19992013, and it reduced the number of years of potential life lost before age 75 due to cancer in
2013 by 566 thousand. The research support that contributed to articles published during 19841998 reduced hospital discharges at an average annual rate of 4.1% during the period 1999-2013,
and it reduced the number of hospital discharges due to cancer in 2013 by 566 thousand.
