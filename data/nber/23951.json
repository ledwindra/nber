    "abstract": "\n\nPresidents often attach statements to the bills they sign into law, purporting to celebrate, construe, or object to provisions in the statute.  Though long a feature of U.S. lawmaking, the President has avowedly attempted to use these signing statements as tool of strategic influence over judicial decisionmaking since the 1980s\u2014as a way of creating \u201cpresidential legislative history\u201d to supplement and, at times, supplant the traditional congressional legislative history conventionally used by the courts to interpret statutes.  In this Article, we examine a novel dataset of judicial opinion citations to presidential signing statements to conduct the most comprehensive empirical examination of how courts have received presidential legislative history to date.  Three main findings emerge from this analysis.  First, contrary to the pervasive (and legitimate) fears in the literature on signing statements, courts rarely cite signing statements in their decisions.  Second, in the aggregate, when courts cite signing statements, they cite them in predictably partisan ways, with judges citing Presidents\u2019 signing statements from their own political parties more often than those of the opposing parties.  This effect, however, is driven entirely by the behavior of Republican-appointed appellate jurists.  Third, courts predominately employ signing statements to buttress aligned statutory text and conventional sources of legislative history, and seemingly never rely on them to override contrary plain statutory text or even unified traditional legislative history.  This suggests that signing statements have low rank among interpretative tools and courts primarily use them to complement rather than substitute for congressional legislative history.  In this sense, Presidents have largely failed to establish an alternative corpus of valid interpretive material.\n\n",
