    "abstract": "\n\nWe provide the first tests to distinguish whether individual investors equally balance their overall portfolios (na\u00efve portfolio diversification\u2014NPD) or engage in na\u00efve buying diversification (NBD)\u2014equally balancing values in same-day purchases of multiple assets. We find NBD in purchases of multiple stocks, and in mixed purchases of individual stocks and funds. In contrast, there is little evidence of NPD. So investors seem to narrowly frame their buy-day decision. Simulation analysis suggests that NBD substantially reduces investor welfare. These findings suggest that behavioral finance theory should incorporate transactional as well as portfolio framing.\n\n",
