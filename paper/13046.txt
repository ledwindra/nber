Cigarette Taxes and Youth Smoking: New Evidence from National, State, & Local Youth
Risk Behavior Surveys
Christopher Carpenter and Philip J. Cook
NBER Working Paper No. 13046
April 2007
JEL No. I1
ABSTRACT
Several studies have examined the effects of state cigarette tax increases on youth substance use over
the 1990s, with most -- but not all -- finding that higher taxes reduce youth consumption of tobacco.
We advance the literature by using data from the 1991-2005 waves of the national Youth Risk Behavior
Surveys (YRBS), providing information on over 100,000 high school age youths. We also are the
first to make use of hundreds of independently fielded state and local versions of the YRBS, reflecting
data from over 750,000 youths. Importantly, these data are to our knowledge the only sources of relevant
information on youth smoking that were explicitly designed to be representative of the sampled state
or locality. We estimate two-way fixed effects models of the effect of state cigarette taxes on youth
smoking, controlling for survey demographics and area and year fixed effects. Our most consistent
finding is that -- contrary to some recent research -- the large state tobacco tax increases of the past
15 years were associated with significant reductions in smoking participation and frequent smoking
by youths. Our price elasticity estimates for smoking participation by high school youths are generally
smaller than previous cross-sectional approaches but are similar to recent quasi-experimental estimates.

1. Introduction
Voters in the state of California recently rejected the largest potential tobacco tax
increase in history: a 13 cent tax increase per cigarette, or a $2.60 increase in the tax on a
pack of 20 cigarettes. Television ads in support of “Prop 86” indicated that the new tax
would “reduce teen smoking by 43 percent.” The magnitude of this figure reflects the
conventional wisdom in research and policy circles that the smoking behaviors of youths
and young adults are highly sensitive to price, more so than for adults who as a group
may have better established habits.
Despite this conventional wisdom, however, a series of recent studies in the
economics literature has called into question whether higher cigarette taxes will “put out
the fires”. Using panel data on youths from the National Educational Longitudinal Study
(NELS), DeCicca et al. (2002) find that once time-invariant state fixed effects are
accounted for, youth smoking initiation is statistically unrelated to cigarette taxes. More
recently, DeCicca et al. (2004, 2006) argue that the strong negative cross sectional
association between cigarette taxes and youth smoking may be more properly attributable
to cross-state differences in previously unobserved state anti-smoking sentiment. Using
novel data on adult attitudes about smoking, DeCicca et al. (2006) create state-specific
measures of anti-smoking attitudes; once they account for this anti-smoking variable in
the cross section, the negative price coefficient becomes small and statistically
insignificant.
These recent findings stand in contrast to a body of research that has found teens
to be responsive to the price of cigarettes, usually proxied by state excise taxes. Much of
the earlier work on this topic used cross-section data and found a negative relationship

2

between youth smoking and state-specific prices and taxes (Lewit, Coate and Grossman
1981, Chaloupka and Grossman 1996, Harris and Chan 1999, and others). Importantly,
however, this relationship has also been found in studies that use quasi-experimental
methods. These types of approaches include state fixed effects as an alternative way to
account for factors that are typically unobserved (such as anti-smoking sentiment). In
this approach, within state changes in prices or taxes rather than interstate differences
identify the teen smoking effect. Significant tax responsiveness using this approach has
been estimated for: 1) teen mothers (Gruber 2000, Ringel and Evans 2001, and others); 2)
high school seniors (Dee 1999, Gruber and Zinman 2001, and others); and 3) young
adults age 18-20 (Sloan and Trogdon 2004). These quasi-experimental studies, however,
return estimates of the tax responsiveness of teen smoking that differ with time period
and sample and are not always significant.1
In this paper we provide new evidence on the effects of state cigarette taxes on the
consumption of cigarettes by high school teens. Specifically, we use repeated cross
section data from the national, state, and local Youth Risk Behavior Surveys over the
period 1991-2005. Our econometric methods are straightforward and involve regressionadjusted difference-in-differences estimation for all data sources, controlling for cigarette
taxes, demographics, clean indoor air laws, and area and year fixed effects. This
approach effectively compares the change in outcomes for youths in states that increased
their cigarette tax to the associated change in outcomes for youths in states that did not

1

Gruber (2000), for example, does not find younger teens to be responsive to prices,
while Dee (1999) finds tax responsiveness only in the latter half of his sample period.
Ringel and Evans (2001) find teen mothers to be least responsive to cigarette tax hikes
(relative to older mothers), while Sloan and Trogdon (2004) find significant
responsiveness for 18-20 year olds but not 21-24 year olds.

experience a tax increase in that year. Across all of our data sources, we find statistically
significant evidence that higher cigarette taxes reduce youth smoking participation and
frequent smoking. Our separate analyses of the national, state, and local YRBS data
suggest that a one-dollar increase in the tax per pack would reduce smoking participation
by 3-6 percentage points, or about 10-20 percent. These estimates translate into price
elasticities of smoking participation for high school youths in the range -.23 to -.56,
which are slightly lower than most previous cross-sectional estimates but very similar to
other recent quasi-experimental approaches.
Our research makes several contributions to the literature. First, we extend
previous national YRBS analyses (which have only used data through 1997) by making
use of data through 2005, the most recent year of the biennial survey. Using these more
recent data allows us to consider over twice as many cigarette tax increases as in previous
research using the national YRBS. Moreover, many of these tax hikes in the period
following the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) between US states and the
major cigarette companies were quite large. Few quasi-experimental studies have
examined tax responsiveness in the post-MSA era (Sloan and Trogdon (2004) and Tauras
et al. (2005) are important exceptions).
Second, we provide new estimates from hundreds of state and local versions of
the YRBS coordinated by state and local public health departments. Together these
surveys include over three quarters of a million high school students over the period
1993-2005. Specifically, we use published aggregate statistics from these data to
estimate weighted least squares models of youth substance use in a common quasiexperimental framework. No previous research has used these data to estimate the tax

4

responsiveness of youth smoking. A major advantage of these data is that – unlike nearly
all of the youth survey data used previously to estimate the tax/smoking relationship
(including Monitoring the future (MTF), national Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS),
NELS, the National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) and the National
Longitudinal Surveys of Youth 1997 (NLSY97)) – these state and local YRBS surveys
were explicitly designed to be representative of the sampled state or locality. As such,
we are able to provide suggestive evidence on the degree of bias from using nonrepresentative surveys – an oft-cited limitation of this literature.
Finally, we provide new results on the importance of controlling for state antismoking sentiment, as recently highlighted by DeCicca et al. (2006). Specifically, we
use YRBS data to replicate their main qualitative finding that the cross-sectional
association between cigarette taxes and youth smoking is reduced when we directly
control for state adult anti-smoking sentiment (which itself is strongly and inversely
related to youth smoking). Despite this, the tax estimate on youth smoking remains
negative and statistically significant even after controlling for anti-smoking sentiment in
the cross section. We also show inclusion of anti-smoking sentiment does not alter the
conclusions drawn from our preferred difference-in-differences models.
The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we outline the empirical challenges
facing researchers in this literature and describe a handful of studies that use quasiexperimental methods to evaluate the effects of state cigarette taxes on youth smoking.
Section 3 presents the data and empirical approach, and Section 4 presents the results.
Section 5 offers a discussion and concludes.

2. Motivation, Empirical Challenges, and Literature Review
A review of the microeconometric literature relating state cigarette taxes to youth
smoking is beyond the scope of this paper; we direct readers to Chaloupka and Warner
(2000) for an excellent review. Briefly, however, we note that a critical issue in this
research area has been the difficulty in accounting for typically unobserved state antismoking sentiment. The concern is that state cigarette taxes and other tobacco control
policies are likely to be correlated with preferences of individuals in those states. In a
typical cross section analysis, this problem will tend to attribute too much explanatory
power to taxes and tobacco control policies; even in the absence of a true “causal” effect
of taxes on youth smoking, for example, this unobserved state anti-smoking sentiment
might produce a spurious negative association between state taxes and youth smoking.
To be certain, researchers have long recognized this fundamental omitted
variables bias problem, and a variety of approaches have been used to address these
concerns. Several studies in this literature, for example, attempt to proxy for unobserved
state anti-smoking sentiment by including controls for whether respondents live in
tobacco producing states – where anti-smoking sentiment is likely to be low. Another
common approach is to include a control for aggregate, overall cigarette consumption in
the state (either current or lagged), while other studies include controls for percent of
state residents that belong to various religions. To the extent that these variables capture
the previously unmeasured state anti-smoking sentiment, their inclusion should reduce
the severity of the bias on the tax and other policy coefficients in a model of youth
smoking.

6

An alternative approach for dealing with state anti-smoking sentiment has been to
estimate models that include year and state fixed effects. The advantage of this approach
is that it removes any time-invariant characteristics about states that are likely to bias tax
coefficients in models of youth smoking.2 Indeed, to the extent that state anti-smoking
sentiment does not change over time, this approach unambiguously purges tax and other
policy estimates from the associated bias. Of course, there are a handful of issues related
to the feasibility of state fixed effects models. First, they require multiple observations
on states; one-time cross-sectional surveys cannot support inclusion of state dummies. A
second complication of the quasi-experimental approach is that – even with repeated
observations on states – the empirical set up requires variation in the variable of interest
within states over time (else the tax variable will be perfectly collinear with state
dummies). That is, the data must span a period witnessing state changes in excise taxes
on cigarettes or other changes in public policy toward youth smoking.3
Several studies using this quasi-experimental method have found strong evidence
that youth smoking responds to tax changes. Ringel and Evans (2001) used smoking
information from birth certificate records for teen mothers over the period 1989-1995.
They found significant tax responsiveness of smoking participation among these young
mothers in state fixed effects models, though the estimated sensitivity for teens was not
greater than for older women. Dee (1999) used data from the Monitoring the Future
2

This approach to estimating price effects on health-behavior choices was introduced by
Cook and Tauchen (1982) and has become standard in the econometric literature (Cook
2007).
3
A common diagnostic used to evaluate the severity of this problem in the context of
cigarette taxes is to regress the tax on state and year dummies. In this auxiliary
regression, a high R-squared (upwards of .90) is usually viewed as problematic. Our data
spanning many tax changes largely avoids this problem: the R-squared from a regression
of taxes on state and year dummies in the 1991-2005 YRBS is just .70.
7

study over the 1977-1992 period to estimate effects of state cigarette taxes on youth
smoking and drinking participation. He found a robust own-price effect on smoking for
youths, but only in the latter part of the sample period. Gruber (2001) and Gruber and
Zinman (2000) pooled data from the first four waves of the national YRBS (1991-1997)
and estimated reduced form models of youth cigarette consumption as a function of
individual demographic characteristics, state excise taxes on cigarettes, and clean indoor
air laws. They found a modest tax effect on consumption that was confined to older
youths (high school seniors).4 Sloan and Trogdon (2004) used data from the Behavioral
Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) on adults over age 18 and found a significant
price response of smoking among young adults age 18-20 in models with state and year
fixed effects. Across a variety of samples, then, cigarette taxes have been shown to
significantly reduce teen smoking even in models with state fixed effects, though not for
every sample.
Despite this body of evidence, the real effects of cigarette taxes on youth smoking
from quasi-experimental models have themselves been called into question by a series of
recent papers that have used longitudinal data on youths from the National Educational
Longitudinal Study (NELS:88). This skeptical view was initiated by DeCicca et al.
(2002), who estimated discrete time hazard models of youth smoking initiation,
controlling for state fixed effects, and found no association between state cigarette taxes
and youth smoking. DeCicca et al. (2004) again reported a null finding in their analysis
of NELS data; they used variation in effective cigarette prices faced by youths who

4

Gruber (2001) and Gruber and Zinman (2000) did not find consistent effects of clean
indoor air policies on smoking participation, though there was some evidence that
government worksite restrictions reduced smoking intensity.
8

“moved” across state lines versus youths who “stayed” in a state as an alternative
identification strategy.
Most recently, DeCicca et al. (2006) analyze two waves of the NELS (1992 and
2000), and report results that support the absence of a substantive association between
state cigarette taxes and youth smoking initiation. This paper takes a different and novel
approach to dealing with concerns about state anti-smoking sentiment. Using data on
adult attitudes about smoking from the Tobacco Use Supplements of the Current
Population Survey (CPS) over the 1990’s and a standard factor analysis technique, the
authors create a state-specific anti-smoking measure. This allows them to directly control
for a newly observed measure of state anti-smoking sentiment instead of including
alternative proxies such as aggregate cigarette production or “tobacco producing state”
indicators. They found that the strong cross-sectional negative association between
cigarette prices and youth smoking initiation was not robust to inclusion of this antismoking sentiment measure. Equally important, all of the variation in youth smoking
“loaded onto” the anti-smoking sentiment measure, which was a statistically significant
predictor of youth smoking in the NELS cross section. DeCicca et al. (2006) interpret
this result and the continued failure of state fixed effects models to return significant
youth smoking effects in the NELS as evidence that cigarette taxes are not an effective
means to reduce youth smoking initiation.
Thus it is fair to say that there is still no consensus on whether taxes have a true
causal effect on youth participation in smoking.

3. Research Design and Data Description
To estimate the effects of state cigarette tax increases on youth smoking and drinking, we
employ restricted use area-identified versions of the 1991-2005 national Youth Risk
Behavior Surveys (YRBS), in conjunction with the independent state and local versions
of the YRBS. The national surveys – which are distinct from the state and local surveys
and were not designed to be representative below the national level – are coordinated
every other year by the Centers for Disease Control and are administered to high school
students at school in the spring.5 The purpose of the YRBS is to monitor the prevalence
of youth behaviors that most influence health, including use of alcohol, tobacco, and
other drugs.
These data provide standard demographic characteristics, information on a variety
of behaviors, and the state of survey (requested in a restricted use version of the data
directly through CDC). We restrict attention to youths with no missing data on the
demographic variables and key outcomes of interest (smoking in the past month),
yielding over 100,000 youths. These data have been used by economists in policy
evaluations similar to ours (e.g. Gruber and Zinman 2001). The YRBS data produce
estimates of past month smoking that closely track the trends from other commonly used
data on youths, such as the Monitoring the Future Study and the National Household
Surveys on Drug Abuse (Gruber 2000).
Specifically, youths are asked: “During the past 30 days, on how many days did
you smoke cigarettes?” We create a variable called Smoker that equals 1 if the person
5

In the 2005 national YRBS, for example, a probability sample of 203 schools was
selected from the universe of public and private schools with at least one of the grades 912. One or two classrooms from each grade of each of these sample schools was
administered a questionnaire (MMWR 2006, p. 2).
10

reported any days of smoking and zero otherwise. We also consider an indicator variable
called Frequent Smoker that equals 1 if the person reported smoking on at least 20 days
in the past 30 and zero otherwise. We chose these outcome variables because they are
consistently reported for every state and local YRBS in the MMWR publications
(described below).6
We use a straightforward two-way fixed-effects framework to estimate the effect
of state cigarette taxes on youth smoking in the national YRBS data. Specifically, we use
standard logit-regression model of the form:
(1)

ln (pist/1- pist) = β0 + β1Xist + β2(Cigarette Tax) st + β3Zst + β4State + β5Year + εist

where pist is the probability that the individual has smoked in the last month (or smoked
frequently in the last month). Xist is a vector of individual demographic characteristics,
including dummies for: female, black, other race, Hispanic, grade, and age. Z is a vector
that includes the state unemployment rate and indicators for clean indoor air laws in
venues likely to affect high school students.7 State is a vector of state dummies, and Year
is a vector of year dummies. Cigarette Tax is the state tax on a pack of cigarettes in 2005

6

The MMWR publications do not report measures of smoking intensity other than the
frequent smoking outcome. Cigarettes smoked per day, for example, is not reported.
Similarly, smokeless tobacco use (snuff or chew) is not consistently reported for the state
or local data. Given that we are interested in comparing tax estimates on smoking across
the national, state, and local YRBS data, we focus attention on the outcomes consistently
reported across all data sources.
7
We use venue coding from the Robert Wood Johnson’s ImpacTeen program.
Specifically, we control for restrictions in government worksites, schools, private
worksites, shopping malls, and restaurants. Examples of venues we exclude include child
care centers. Results are not sensitive to including other venues, and no venue-specific
restriction was consistently significant in the predicted direction. These null findings are
similar to those from Gruber and Zinman (2000).
11

dollars.8 The coefficient of interest, β2, captures the relative effect of state cigarette taxes
on youth smoking by comparing within area increases in state cigarette taxes to the
associated outcomes for youths in states that did not experience a cigarette tax increase in
that year. Standard errors are clustered at the state level throughout (Bertrand, Duflo, and
Mullainathan 2004).
In addition to the national YRBS, we also make use of aggregate statistics from
the state and local YRBS. These surveys are coordinated by public health officials in the
respective states and include standard questions that reproduce those in the national
survey. As described above, an important feature of these data is that the majority of the
state and local efforts were explicitly designed to be representative of the state or locality
in question. To our knowledge, these weighted state and local surveys are the only
consistent state/year panel of representative data on smoking among high school students.
The coverage of state surveys is extensive (see Appendix Table 5), while the local YRBS
modules are generally concentrated in large urban centers such as Los Angeles, New
York City, Boston, and Chicago (see Appendix Table 6 for a complete list). The state
and local YRBS are fielded every other year, and the aggregate estimates of the health
outcomes based on the underlying microdata are published in Morbidity and Mortality
Weekly Report. Included in each report are various characteristics for each site.
Specifically, we observe: the relevant sample size on which the estimates are based;
8

These data come from The Tax Burden on Tobacco and the Campaign for Tobacco Free
Kids. We use the tax in effect as of March of the survey year (i.e. the current tax). Note
that we ignore the fact that a handful of localities also impose cigarette taxes. We are not
aware of a consistent state/year panel of local cigarette taxes, and previous research
similarly does not control for local taxes. We also estimated models that included
controls for the square of the cigarette tax in addition to the tax itself. The cigarette tax
estimate was large, negative, and statistically significant while the coefficient on the
squared tax was smaller and statistically insignificant.

whether the survey was unweighted or weighted to be representative; the overall, student,
and school response rates; the fraction of the school population that is white, black, other
race, and Hispanic; the fraction of the population that is in each grade (9-12); and various
aggregate outcomes with respect to substance use.
For our state and local YRBS analyses, we estimate separate weighted least
squares models where the weights are the relevant sample sizes of the surveys on which
the substance use rates are based. In particular, we estimate the following OLS
regressions:
(2)

ln(Yat /1- Yat)= β0 + β1Xat + β2(Cigarette Tax) at + β3Zat + β4Area + β5Year + εat

where a denotes area (city or state) and t denotes survey year. Since we only observe the
aggregate outcomes reported in the MMWR publications, Yat is the fraction of the sample
reporting the behavior in question (smoking or frequent smoking). Xat is a vector of
sample characteristics that includes: overall response rate, school response rate, student
response rate, percent grade 10, percent grade 11, percent grade 12, percent black,
percent other race, and percent Hispanic. The variables in Z are as described above.
Area is a vector of either state dummies or city dummies, depending on the dataset. Year
is a vector of survey year dummies. β2 is again the coefficient of interest, and standard
errors are clustered at the state level.
Appendix Tables 4 – 6 present the state/year and city/year combinations for which
we have national, state, and local YRBS data, respectively. We also shade the area/year
combinations in which a state increased its excise tax on cigarettes to illustrate the extent

13

of within-place variation over our sample period.9 Several patterns merit discussion.
First, the national and state YRBS surveys have a wide but far from complete coverage of
states. Second, there are numerous state policy experiments with respect to excise tax
increases that we can examine in these data. Third, the more recent data – since 1999, for
example – contains more data points and more policy experiments than the earlier 19911997 data analyzed by previous research.

4. Results
We present descriptive statistics for the national, state, and local YRBS in Tables 1a and
1b. The national YRBS data suggest that over the entire period almost 30 percent of high
school youths smoked cigarettes in the past month, and 13 percent smoked on at least 20
of the previous 30 days. The state YRBS surveys produce similar rates of past month
smoking (Table 1b) but the local YRBS produce lower estimates. This difference likely
reflects the fact that the local surveys were concentrated in urban areas; only 19 percent
of the local samples are white students, for example. As such, the lower rates in the local
YRBS data are explained by the well-documented lower rates of teen smoking by nonwhite youths. Table 1b also illustrates the key advantage of these local and state surveys:
the vast majority were explicitly designed to be representative (88 and 79 percent,
respectively).
9

Note that because the surveys are administered at schools in the Spring, we are not able
to use all of the policy changes shaded in the Tables. If a state changed its excise tax in
the fall, for example, we highlight it in the Tables but any data observed in that year is
coded as being from the “pre” tax period. In all cases, we assume the surveys were
administered in March of the survey year. Individual discussions with survey
administrators and the CDC highlighted that while there is no way to verify when surveys
were administered, February and March are common months for administration of the
YRBS.
14

Table 2 presents the baseline cross-section and quasi-experimental estimates for
the outcome indicating any smoking in the past month from the national, state, and local
YRBS data. Across all three data sources we find consistent evidence that state excise
taxes on cigarettes are negatively related to youth smoking participation. Importantly, we
find that the difference-in-differences estimates (based on regressions with fixed effects
included) are somewhat smaller than the “cross section” estimates without fixed effects,
consistent with the idea that the cross section estimates are biased because unobserved
state characteristics are correlated with cigarette taxes and smoking outcomes. Even after
accounting for time-invariant area characteristics, however, we find across all three data
sources that increases in state cigarette taxes significantly reduce youth smoking
participation. Appendix Table 1 presents detailed coefficients on the control variables in
the smoking participation model using the national YRBS data.10
In Table 3 we present the estimates from the frequent smoking outcome (defined
as smoking on at least 20 of the past 30 days). The format of Table 3 mirrors that of
Table 2, with similar coefficient estimates (although in this case the inclusion of fixed

10

We also estimated models separately by race in the national YRBS data (the only
source for which we have the microdata on race). Tax estimates for white youths were
slightly larger than the baseline estimates and statistically distinguishable from zero. Tax
estimates for nonwhite youths were negative, smaller than the baseline, and not
statistically significant (we could not rule out either large tax responsiveness or no tax
responsiveness). We also considered models separately before and after the Master
Settlement Agreement in 1998. The pre-MSA analysis on the national YRBS data
essentially mirrored Gruber’s (2001) finding: taxes were negatively related to youth
smoking, but the estimates were not significant in the full sample. The post-MSA
observations returned imprecisely estimated null tax estimates in the national data. We
also performed this same exercise on the state YRBS data and obtained the opposite
pattern: the pre-MSA tax coefficient (using only 1993, 1995, and 1997 observations) was
an imprecisely estimated zero, while the post-MSA tax coefficient was large and
negative. We therefore view the investigation into pre/post MSA differences in tax
responsiveness as inconclusive.

effects results in larger coefficients in two of three cases). To translate the point
estimates from the logit regressions into something more intuitive, we compute the point
estimate for change in probability of smoking (or frequent smoking) using as the baseline
the mean smoking rates over the sample period from the national YRBS (29.5% for
smoking participation and 13.5% for frequent smoking). We provide point estimates
based on the high and low estimates of responsiveness from the regression results. In
sum, a $1.00 increase in tax would reduce smoking prevalence from 29.5% to 26.8%
(state surveys data) or 23.6% (national survey). In other words, the reduction would be
2.7 – 5.9 percentage points. From the baseline of 29.5%, this is a reduction of about 9 –
20%.

Similarly, the reduction in the prevalence of frequent smoking ranges from 2.4 to 4.1
percentage points, which is about 18 – 30% of the sample mean (13.5%).
Note that “frequent smoking” is the only measure of smoking intensity that is
available for all three sets of YRBS surveys, and that is why we focus on this measure.
The national survey, but not the state and city surveys, also includes an item on number
of cigarettes smoked in the last month. Appendix Table 1 reports the results of regressing
that measure (in log form) on the same specification as reported in Tables 2 and 3. The

16

coefficient estimate for the tax rate is essentially zero. Since the sample for that
regression is restricted to smokers, this result implies that those youths who continue to
smoke when taxes are raised smoke the same amount on average as the larger group who
smoked at the previous (lower) tax rate. One interpretation is that tax has no effect on the
intensive margin for smokers. Another interpretation is that the “zero” effect is the result
of two processes that tend to cancel out – those who quit in response to higher taxes tend
to be the lighter smokers (thus raising the average of those who continue), and those who
continue smoking in fact smoke less than they otherwise would have.
In Table 4 we provide some evidence on the sensitivity of our main smoking
estimates to the quantity and quality of the data. Recall that our analyses of state and
local YRBS data have thus far restricted attention to observations that are constructed to
be unbiased, in the sense that sample weights were used in computing the population
estimates. Table 4 reprints the state and local YRBS estimates from this restricted data
set, and also displays the results of including other state YRBS observations for which
population estimates are computed from survey results without weighting (creating a real
possibility of bias). In the state YRBS analysis, this is a sizable number of observations –
about 50, or over one quarter of the sample size when using weighted surveys only. For
the local YRBS analysis, the absolute discrepancy is smaller (14), but as a percentage of
the weighted surveys (14%), it is still substantial. The estimates in Table 4 suggest that
restricting attention to the weighted estimates for the state YRBS analysis has very little
effect on coefficient and standard error estimates.
In Table 5 we explore the robustness of our main smoking results to inclusion of
direct controls for state anti-smoking sentiment. Recall that this approach was recently

17

used by DeCicca et al. (2006) as an alternative way to test for the strength of the crosssectional relationship between taxes and youth smoking, as well as to provide a
commentary on the ability of previous approaches to appropriately capture state antismoking sentiment. We use the direct anti-smoking sentiment measures created by
DeCicca et al. to examine whether their main empirical result holds up in the YRBS.11
The results of these exercises are presented in Table 5 for smoking participation.12
First, in Row 1 we report the cross-sectional results (without fixed effects) for the state
cigarette tax and anti-smoking sentiment. When entered by itself the tax coefficient is
significantly negative (as was shown previously in Table 2). The same is true when we
enter sentiment directly without controlling for the state cigarette tax. When we include
both measures in Column 3, we reproduce the main DeCicca et al. (2006) finding: the tax
coefficient becomes smaller, with much of the estimated variation “loading onto” the
sentiment measure. Notably, however, our tax estimate remains negative, sizable, and
statistically significant at the ten percent level. That is, using this alternative approach for
dealing with state anti-smoking sentiment, we continue to find evidence for a significant
role for state cigarette taxes.13 This finding is consistent both with a significant tax

11

The anti-smoking sentiment measure is created from the 1992/93, 1995/96, 1998/99,
and 2000/2001 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Survey. This yields
direct measures of sentiment for 1993, 1995, 1999, and 2001 in our data. In private
correspondence with Don Kenkel (12/08/2006) we have obtained a complete state
specific anti-sentiment measure for all years of our sample (1991-2005) based on linear
interpolations from the years for which direct sentiment values are observed. Models that
restricted attention only to those years for which the sentiment variable is directly
observed produced similar results.
12
Models for frequent smoking produced similar results and are not presented here to
conserve space.
13
The coefficient estimate suggests that a one dollar increase in cigarette taxes would
reduce youth smoking participation by 2.8 percentage points.
18

responsiveness of youth smoking and with the claim that failing to account for
unobserved anti-smoking sentiment overstates the magnitude of this relationship.
In Row 2 of Table 5 we further explore this issue by presenting the associated
difference-in-differences estimates of youth smoking in models that do and do not control
for the state sentiment measure. Note here that there is very little within state variation in
state anti-smoking sentiment once state dummies are included in the model; as such, this
exercise is not intended to be a “test” of sentiment but rather a comment on the sensitivity
of the tax estimate to inclusion of sentiment in a model that includes state dummies. We
again find that in models that include state and year dummies, taxes and sentiment
entered separately are both negatively related to youth smoking (recall that higher values
of the sentiment measure reflect more anti-smoking attitudes). We also find that the tax
estimate remains largely unchanged (i.e. it is still large, negative, and statistically
significant) once we account for state anti-smoking sentiment in the difference-indifferences model. Finally, we note that although the standard errors on the sentiment
variable become much larger once we include state dummies (given their strong
collinearity), the point estimates are largely unchanged. That is, the limited within state
variation in sentiment that does exist continues to have a large estimated negative
relationship with youth smoking that is very similar to the cross-sectional estimate.
Again, we interpret the patterns in Table 5 as consistent both with a strong effect of
cigarette taxes on youth smoking and with the possibility that state anti-smoking
sentiment exerts independently meaningful effects on smoking outcomes.
The fact that we find significant effects of the cigarette tax raises a natural
question: do these estimates reflect “real” price effects or are they confounded by other

19

changes that tended to occur at the same time and place as the tax increases?14 To
partially address the possibility that the tax change was linked in that sense to other
changes influencing health behaviors, we experimented with other items found in the
national YRBS. Reassuringly, we found that none of the following were statistically
related to cigarette tax increases: the likelihood of using cocaine in the past month and
the likelihood of carrying a weapon in the past month.15 (The results are not reported
here but are available upon request). Thus, the significant cigarette tax effects we
estimate for tobacco consumption are unlikely to be attributable to, say, coincident public
health campaigns.

5. Discussion and Conclusion
The results in Tables 2-5 indicate that state cigarette tax increases of the past 15 years
were effective at reducing smoking participation and frequent smoking by high school
students. Across our analyses of three distinct data sets, we find qualitatively similar
estimates: an increase in the state cigarette tax reduces the probability a youth reports past
30 day smoking and frequent smoking.
A remaining issue is whether the magnitude of our estimated cigarette tax effects
seems reasonable. Recall that television advertisements for the proposed $2.60 cigarette
tax increase in California claimed that it would decrease teen smoking by 43 percent.
How does that compare with our estimates? If we use the mean of smoking participation
14

It could be, for example, that states use the funds raised from cigarette taxes to promote
general public health initiatives. In that case, one may worry that a negative association
between state cigarette taxes and “bad” youth outcomes, even in the presence of state and
year dummies, is not reflecting the effects of changing tobacco consumption per se.
15
We also found that the likelihood of using snuff or chew in the past month was
unrelated to cigarette taxes.
20

in the national YRBS data as a baseline (29%), then from the results in Table 2, the range
of point estimates following a $2.60 increase is from 13.6% (national survey) to 22%
(state surveys). The proportional reduction in the first case is 53%, even larger than the
ad claim, but the second estimate is just a 24% reduction. It seems fair to say that if the
advertising is to be faulted, it is for conveying a false sense of precision rather than for
exaggeration.
An alternative and useful way to think about magnitudes in this context is to
compare the implied price elasticities from our national, state, and local YRBS analyses
to those from the previous literature. DeCicca et al. (2002) report from several sources
that the “consensus” estimate regarding the price elasticity of youth smoking was about 0.7, which suggests that a 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes would reduce
youth smoking by about 7 percent. Given a mean tax in our national YRBS sample of 52
cents, we estimate a tax elasticity of teen smoking to be -0.106. Calculating the price
elasticity implied by this estimate requires information on the pass through of state
cigarette taxes to prices as well as the fraction of the total price attributable to the tax.
The latter figure is directly calculable from our data using information on real prices from
the Tax Burden on Tobacco; over our sample taxes constitute about 17 percent of the
retail price. For the pass-through of taxes to prices we use an estimate from Keeler et al.
(1996) of 1.11; that is, a one dollar increase in taxes increases the average retail price by
one dollar and eleven cents. Using these estimates in conjunction with our estimated tax
elasticity from the national YRBS data suggests a price elasticity of -0.56, which is fairly
close to the “consensus” estimate of -0.7. Our state YRBS estimates, however, produce a
notably smaller tax elasticity estimate of -0.047; this translates to a teen price elasticity of

21

smoking participation of about -0.25.16 This estimate is very close to the estimate of 0.27 reported in Sloan and Trogdon (2004) for 18-20 year olds, which also was derived
from a model with state and year fixed effects and included the post-MSA period.
Several caveats and limitations are in order. Some of these are typical to studies
that use youth survey data to evaluate public policies regarding youth consumption of
harmful substances. For example, the YRBS surveys are administered to youths at
school. This procedure necessarily excludes youths absent from school on the survey
day, as well as high school dropouts. These missing youths may be more or less
responsive to cigarette prices than those who answered the survey. Whether our
estimates can be reliably extended to the entire population of high-school-aged youths is
unknown. Second, the YRBS substance use data are all self reported. This is an obvious
limitation to studies such as ours, and there is little we can do to correct for systematic
errors in reporting. Reporting errors will lead to bias in coefficient estimates if the under
reporting rate is systematically related to changes in state excise taxes.17
It should also be noted that we have not specified the mechanisms by which an
increase in cigarette taxes affect youth smoking decisions. Most high-school students are
16

The price elasticity estimate from the city/local YRBS data falls in between these
estimates at -0.49.
17
Only about three percent of youths do not report information on smoking outcomes. In
an evaluation context we were most concerned that failure to report smoking behavior
may be correlated with cigarette tax changes. To evaluate this problem, we first
estimated a model where we related the likelihood of missing information on smoking
outcomes to the cigarette taxes; although the coefficient on the cigarette tax was positive,
it was very small and statistically insignificant. Specifically, we estimated that a one
dollar increase in the state cigarette tax would increase the probability of missing data on
smoking outcomes by .06 percentage points, or only about 2 percent. Moreover,
recoding all observations with missing information on smoking as past 30 day smokers
(i.e. making the extreme assumption that all non-responders are actually smokers) did not
change our main results: the tax coefficient in this model was very similar to the baseline
presented below and remained statistically significant at the five percent level.
22

too young to legally buy cigarettes, and most of them obtain their cigarettes from social
sources (friends and family). An increase in cigarette taxes may make potential sources
more reluctant to provide youths with cigarettes, or lead them to charge more. The
prevalence of smoking among friends and family may also be influential through social
contagion processes (Krauth 2005, Powell and Chaloupka 2005, and others), so that the
increase in taxes influences youth smoking indirectly by influencing the smoking rates in
their social environment. Perhaps the best interpretation of our results is that they reflect
a reduced form of direct and indirect influences on youth decisions. Regardless, these
results offer new support for the belief that raising cigarette taxes will help discourage
youths from smoking.
