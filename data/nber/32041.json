    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper asks whether increasing productivity in the electricity sector can yield larger long-run GDP gains than suggested by electricity\u2019s small share of aggregate economic activity. We answer this question using a dynamic multi-sector model in which electricity is a strong complement to other inputs in production. We parameterize the model using our own new measures of electricity-sector TFP across countries. The model predicts modest long-run GDP gains from improving electricity-sector TFP, contrary to the notion that electricity is a weak link. Parameterizations that make electricity a weak link mostly require the electricity sector to be counterfactually large or unproductive.\n\n",
