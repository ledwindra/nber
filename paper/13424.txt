International Portfolios with Supply, Demand and Redistributive Shocks

ABSTRACT
This paper explains three key stylized facts observed in industrialized countries: 1) portfolio holdings
are biased towards local equity; 2) international portfolios are long in foreign currency assets and short
in domestic currency; 3) the depreciation of a country's exchange rate is associated with a net external
capital gain, i.e. with a positive wealth transfer from the rest of the world. We present a two-country,
two-good model with trade in stocks and bonds, and three types of disturbances: shocks to endowments,
to the relative demand for home vs. foreign goods, and to the distribution of income between labor
and capital. With these shocks, optimal international portfolios are shown to be consistent with the
stylized facts.

Introduction

In the past twenty years, international capital ‡ows have increased to unprecedented levels, for both
bonds and stocks. Gross external …nancial positions now exceed 100% of GDP for major industrialized
countries, so that variations in exchange rates and asset returns may generate sizable wealth transfers
between countries. For industrialized countries, international portfolios are long in foreign currency and
short in domestic currency, so that the depreciation of a country‘s exchange rate generates a net external
capital gain, i.e. a positive wealth transfer from the rest of the world. Strikingly, though, home bias
in equity portfolios remains sizable, despite the fact that most legal and technological impediments to
international trade in assets have been eliminated, among industrialized countries. Lane and MilesiFerretti (2003, 2005, 2006a,b), Tille (2005), Gourinchas and Rey (2005) and Lane and Shambaugh (2007)
have recently documented these facts (see also Tables A1 and A2 in the Appendix).
The goal of this paper is to explain these facts. For this purpose, a general equilibrium model with
two countries (Home and Foreign) and two goods is used. There is international trade in Home and
Foreign stocks and bonds. The model assumes consumption home bias, in accordance with the fact that
the bulk of consumption consists of local goods. Three exogenous disturbances are assumed: shocks to
endowments, to the distribution of income between labor and capital (‘redistributive shocks’), and to the
relative world demand for Home vs. Foreign goods. The relative demand shocks can re‡ect changes in
preferences or in the quality or number of varieties of Home/Foreign goods.
Existing models of portfolio choice are generally unable to explain the international portfolio facts.
We argue that one of the main reasons for this is that the prior literature has focused on supply shocks.
When faced with a negative supply shock in the Home country - which triggers a Home real exchange rate
appreciation - the optimal portfolio should generate an increase in Home net external …nancial income, in
order to …nance an increase in Home net imports and thus stabilize Home consumption. With just supply
shocks, the optimal Home portfolio is hence biased towards Foreign equity: Foreign equity is a better
hedge for Home output shocks than Home equity (the Foreign equity return exceeds the Home equity
return when Home output is low). Note also that a model with just supply shocks predicts that a country
whose exchange rate appreciates experiences a capital gain on its external assets, i.e. a wealth transfer
from the rest of the world; in practice, however, industrialized countries that experience an exchange rate

2

appreciation su¤er a capital loss on their external assets.
We show that the introduction of redistributive shocks and of relative demand shocks allows to
generate equity home bias, and external “valuation e¤ects" (e¤ects of exchange rate and asset price
‡uctuations on external positions) that are broadly consistent with the empirical evidence. Contrary to
most of the related literature, we allow for trade in two bonds, denominated in Home and Foreign goods,
respectively. The …nancial market is (e¤ectively) complete when there are just two types of shocks; the
market is incomplete with the three simultaneous types of shocks.
Intuitively, a redistributive shock (a shock that increases dividends of domestic …rms while reducing
domestic labor income) can be hedged by holding stocks of local …rms, the home bias observed in the data.
We show that, given equity home bias, it is e¢ cient for each agent to go long in foreign currency bonds
and short in domestic currency bonds, in order to hedge relative demand shocks. For example, when faced
with a negative relative demand shock for Home goods - which worsens Home terms of trade - a bond
portfolio that is short in Home good bonds and long in Foreign good bonds generates an external capital
gain for the Home household, which allows the Home country to stabilize its consumption, by allowing it
to increase its imports. The optimal bond portfolio thus produces a wealth transfer towards the country
that experiences a depreciation of its real exchange rate, which is in line with actual valuation e¤ects
(see discussion above). We show that a plausibly calibrated model with simultaneous supply, demand
and redistributive shocks produces realistic equity and bond positions, and that it captures the external
valuation e¤ects observed for industrialized countries.
To our knowledge, this is the …rst model which analyzes international equity portfolio choices, in an
incomplete markets setting. Interestingly, the assumption here that there are bonds denominated in local
and in foreign goods helps to explain equity home bias, as terms of trade movements can be hedged by
holding bonds. In our model, international risk sharing occurs both through equity and bond holdings.
In the next section, we review the related literature and point to di¤erences with the present analysis.
Section 3 describes the model set-up. Section 4 solves for optimal portfolios under complete markets.
Section 5 considers incomplete markets; we provide closed-form solutions for portfolios under incomplete
markets, using the method developed by Devereux and Sutherland (2006) and calibrate our model to
analyze its quantitative properties.

Related literature

Since the well-known paper of French and Poterba (1991) that documented equity home bias, various
form of cross-country heterogeneity among investors have been analyzed, in order to explain international
portfolio holdings. Indeed, without heterogeneity, all investors would, in equilibrium, hold the same
portfolio of worldwide assets, and thus no bias towards local assets would exist (see Lewis (1999) for a
survey). In the present paper, we abstract from barriers to international capital movements and assume
that any investor can purchase any security without transaction costs. In other words, each investor
faces the same investment opportunity set; this is, admittedly, a strong assumption but our result would
be reinforced if we assumed costs of buying foreign securities1 . However, we assume that consumers
have a greater preference for the locally produced good than for the imported good (consumption home
bias). Empirically, the bulk of consumption consists of locally produced goods (see Kollmann (2006b)).
Consumption home bias implies that the (consumption-based) real exchange rate ‡uctuates in response
to supply and demand shocks. A recent literature has discussed possible links between the …nancial and
real home biases; in particular, Obstfeld and Rogo¤ (2000), have argued that consumption home bias
(due to trade costs for goods) can solve the equity home bias puzzle.
Uppal (1993), Coeurdacier (2005), Kollmann (2006a,b) and Obstfeld (2006) study portfolio choice
in models with consumption home bias; in those settings, there are just output shocks, and the only
traded assets are domestic and foreign stocks. Those models can only generate equity home bias when
the substitution elasticity between domestic and imported goods is (roughly speaking) smaller than unity.
Intuitively, a country that receives a negative output shock experiences an improvement of its terms of
trade; when the substitution elasticity between local and imported goods is low, then the terms of trade
improvement is so strong that the return on local equity rises compared to the return on foreign equity;
thus, local equity has a high (relative) return in states of the world in which the country’s output is low;
this makes holding local equity attractive, and induces investors to mainly invest their wealth in local
stocks. By contrast, when the substitution elasticity exceeds unity, then the relative return on local equity
drops, when local output falls, and hence foreign equity is a better hedge for output ‡uctuations. Hence,
a model with just supply shocks only generates equity home bias under the condition that a negative

local output shock raises the relative return on local equity. Essentially, in such a model, equity home
bias only arises when a country’s relative equity return is highly positively correlated with its terms of
trade (and, hence, with its real exchange rate). Yet, empirically, the correlation between relative equity
returns and real exchange rate changes is close to zero (see van Wincoop and Warnock (2006)).

Our

model here reproduces this low correlation, yet it also generates realistic equity home bias. This is due
to the fact that (as mentioned above) our model assumes trade in stocks and in two bonds, denominated
in the home and the foreign goods, respectively 2 . In our setting, bonds are essentially used to hedge real
exchange rate risk, a feature that we view as realistic. Moreover, we assume relative demand shocks and
redistributive shocks, in addition to the more standard supply shocks. Those new shocks break the close
link between terms of trade movements and relative equity returns.
Another strand of literature related to our paper analyzes the impact of non-tradable labor income
on equity home bias. According to this literature, the presence of labor income either worsens the home
bias in equities puzzle (Brainard and Tobin (1991), Baxter and Jermann (1997)) or helps explaining it
(Bottazzi, Pesenti and van Wincoop (1996), Julliard (2002 and 2004), Engel and Matsumoto (2006)).
In the models discussed by these authors, the composition of equity portfolios hinges on the correlation
between equity returns and wages; as households seek to hedge their human capital risk, they only hold
local equity if local stock returns are negatively correlated with labor income (Bottazzi, Pesenti and van
Wincoop (1996), Engel and Matsumoto (2006))3 . In our paper, labor income and equity returns are
partially disconnected due to redistributive shocks from labor to capital (or dividends). There are two
main di¤erences that set our paper apart from the existing theoretical literature on the role of labor
income in international portfolio choice. First, as already mentioned, we allow for two di¤erentiated
(tradable) goods and two di¤erentiated bonds4 . Due to the availability of bonds, the direction of the
equity bias is not pinned down by the correlation between equity returns and wages. This can produce
drastically di¤erent equity portfolios compared to the existing literature. The intuition for our result
can be simply exposed in a situation where there are only output (endowment) shocks and redistributive
shocks. In that case, the model here predicts full equity home bias, for any stochastic structure of the two
2 Pavlova and Rigobon (2004) also present a two country model with trade in stocks and in di¤erentiated bonds, but
they exclusively focus on complete markets, and do not analyze portfolio choices:
3 Lustig and van Nieuwerburgh (2005) argue that, empirically, physical and human capital returns are negatively correlated
4 Engel and Matsumoto (2006) also allow for trade in home and foreign bonds.

types of shock; households fully hold the local equity to insure themselves against redistributive shocks.
Output shocks are hedged using positions in Home and Foreign bonds, as supply shocks a¤ect the return
di¤erence between the two bonds (by altering terms-of-trade).
A second di¤erence is that while most existing theoretical models assume that an equity portfolio
exists that perfectly mimics wage returns (a case of perfect spanning and complete markets), we here
allow for market incompleteness. This is important because complete markets models counterfactually
predict perfect correlation between the ratio of home to foreign marginal utilities of consumption and
the real exchange rate (the well-known “consumption-real exchange rate anomaly"; see Kollmann (1991,
1995, 1996), Backus and Smith (1993)); as recently documented, by Corsetti, Dedola, Leduc (2007) and
Benigno and Thoenissen (2006), the correlation between relative consumption and the real exchange is
low in the data (see also Chari, Kehoe, McGrattan (2002)). While Corsetti, Dedola, Leduc (2007) (or
Kollmann (1995,1996)) tackle the puzzle by restricting the menu of assets, we adopt here a di¤erent
strategy by increasing the number of shocks to obtain incomplete markets.
The theoretical literature on external valuation e¤ects is more recent and has focused on their impact
on current account adjustment. See, for example, Tille (2005), Blanchard, Giavazzi and Sa (2005) and
Ghironi, Lee and Rebucci (2006). Ghironi et al. (2006) have a richer dynamic business cycle model (with
endogenous labor and production) than the present paper. However, they assume that international
…nancial transactions are costly and restricted to stocks In their model, steady state equity portfolios
are pinned down by costs to holding foreign stocks. By contrast, our model assumes trade in stocks and
bonds in a frictionless …nancial market.

Set-up of the model
Goods and preferences

We consider a two-period (t = 0; 1) endowment economy. There are two symmetric countries, Home (H)
and Foreign (F ), each with a representative household. Each country produces one good. There is no
output (and no consumption) at t = 0, but agents trade …nancial claims (stocks and bonds) at date 0.
In period 1, country i = H; F receives an exogenous endowment yi of good i. E0 (yi ) = 1 holds for both
countries, where E0 is the conditional expectation operator, given date t = 0 information. Once stochastic
6

endowments are realized, households consume using their …nancial and labor incomes (see below).
The country i household has these preferences:

the shock

i

can also have a more supply oriented interpretation, as a shock to the quality of good i.

In a model with love for variety of the Dixit-Stiglitz type, the shock could also re‡ect a change in the
number of di¤erentiated good varieties produced by country i. Broda and Weinstein (2007) report that
electronics, records and tapes is the product group that has the largest quality/new goods bias in the
CPI. Hence, our choice of name.
We assume a preference bias for local goods,

Financial markets

There is trade in stocks and bonds, in period 0. Each stock represents a share in one of the future
endowments. The supply of each type of share is normalized at unity. An exogenous fraction ki of
the country i endowment yi accrues to share holders, while a fraction (1

ki ) is received by the local

household. Hence, (1 ki )pi yi can be interpreted as country i ‘labor’income. There is a bond denominated
in the Home good, and a bond denominated in the Foreign good. Buying one unit of the Home (Foreign)
bond in period 0 gives one unit of the Home (Foreign) good at t = 1. Both bonds are in zero net supply.
Each household fully owns the local stock, at birth, and has zero initial foreign assets. The country i
household thus faces the following budget constraint, at t = 0:
pS Sii + pS Sji + bii + bij = pS ;

with j 6= i

(9)

where Sji is the number of shares of stock j held by country i, at the end of period 0, while bij represents
claims (held by i) to future unconditional payments of good j. pS is the share price (identical for both
stocks due to symmetry)5 .

portfolios. S >

means that there is equity home bias; and b < 0 means that a country issues bonds

denominated in its local good, and that the country is lending in units of the foreign good.
Finally, we de…ne a country’s net foreign “currency" position (FCP) as its holdings of assets denominated in foreign good units, net of the country’s liabilities denominated in foreign good. Up to a

Empirically, F CP is positive for industrialized countries (as explained in the Introduction). Note
that, in the model, F CP equals the expected payment of foreign "currency" (foreign good) received
by a country, in period 1. Symmetry entails that if a country is long in foreign currency (F CP > 0),
then the country has a short position of the same amount, in its own currency (good). A positive F CP
means that, ceteris paribus, a 1% worsening of a country’s terms of trade (q) generates an increase in the
country’s net external income that represents F CP % of its expected GDP.

Characterization of world equilibrium with complete markets

To build up intuition, we …rst characterize the equilibrium with (e¤ectively) complete markets (as shown
below, markets are complete when the number of shocks equals the number of assets).

4.1

E¢ cient consumption and terms-of-trade

When markets are complete, the equilibrium allocation is Pareto e¢ cient, so that it corresponds to the
allocation chosen by a social planner who maximizes the sum of countries’utilities, subject to the resource
constraints (6) and (7):

Budget constraints

Recall that each household holds shares S and 1

(23)

As expected, Home terms-of-trade (q) are decreasing in relative Home output yb (with an elasticity

). Home terms of trade are increasing in the relative demand (iPod) shock

if and only if

> 1;

roughly speaking, this is the case when the substitution elasticity between Home and Foreign goods, ;
is larger than unity. The reason why the sign of the response of terms of trade to the relative iPod shock
depends on the substitution elasticity is the following: the relative supply of good H in “e¢ ciency”
units is

y, while the relative price of one e¢ ciency unit of good H (in e¢ ciency units of good F ) is

q= . Hence, a positive relative iPod shock both induces an increase in the (relative) supply of good
H, in e¢ ciency units, and an increase in demand. While the …rst e¤ect reduces the relative price (not
adjusted for e¢ ciency units) with an elasticity of

1

, the second e¤ect increases the relative price with

a unit elasticity. When demand is su¢ ciently elastic (so that

exceeds unity), then the demand e¤ect

dominates and the relative price (unadjusted for e¢ ciency units) increases with the relative iPod shock.

The …rst equality shows the Pareto optimal reaction of relative consumption spending to a change of
the welfare based real exchange rate. This reaction depends on the coe¢ cient of relative risk aversion. In
a Pareto e¢ cient equilibrium, a shock that appreciates the (welfare based) real exchange rate of country
H, induces an increase in country H relative consumption spending when

analysis here). The risk-sharing condition (16) shows that when the (welfare based) real exchange rate

income of F ) necessary to obtain the Pareto optimal allocation. Given

> 1, the e¢ cient portfolio has

to be such that a real appreciation (welfare based) is associated with an increase in relative spending and
income.
The …nancial market is e¤ectively complete (up to a …rst order approximation) when there exists
a pair (S; b) such that (23) and the second equation in (24) both hold for arbitrary realizations of the
relative shocks yb; b ; b
k. Clearly, the market can only be complete when there are (at most) two relative

shocks.

Complete markets examples

We now solve for equilibrium portfolios in economies with just two (relative) shocks. In these economies,
markets are e¤ectively complete (perfect spanning).
4.4.1

Output and iPod shocks

We start with a situation with just relative supply (output) and iPod shocks yb; c . The following portfolio

local equity share depends on three terms: the …rst term, 1=2; represents the diversi…cation motive in a
single-good world with zero labor income, as analyzed by Lucas (1982): in such a world equity portfolios
are fully diversi…ed. The second term,

1 (2a 1) (1 1= )
2
1 ,
k

represents the hedging of real exchange rate

risk, as analyzed, i.a., in Coeurdacier (2005), Kollmann (2006b), Obstfeld (2007) and van Wincoop
and Warnock (2006); this term is negative, i.e. it generates foreign equity bias, when the substitution

12

elasticity between goods, , is (roughly speaking) larger than unity (so that

> 1)6 ; when there is no

consumption home bias (a = 1=2), the real exchange rate is constant and the second term disappears.
The third term,

11 k
2 k ,

represents the foreign equity bias in a single-good world with labor income and

a constant capital share, so that labor and capital incomes are perfectly positively correlated (see Baxter
and Jerman (1997)); in such a world, foreign equity bias emerges as labor income is less closely correlated
with foreign equity returns than with domestic returns.
With just supply and iPod shocks, bonds are not useful for the hedging of terms of trade risk, as the
latter is hedged using stocks; hence, b = 0:
Thus, this case shares the di¢ culties of the previous literature to explain equity home bias. It makes
clear that in order to get more realistic portfolios, one needs a shock that eliminates the perfect correlation
between relative dividends and the real exchange rate, as well as the perfect correlation between labor
and capital incomes. We next analyze such a shock, namely a redistributive shock.
4.4.2

Output and redistributive shocks

^
We now analyze a situation with just relative output and capital share (redistributive) shocks, yb and k.

It follows from (23) and (24) that, in this case, the equilibrium portfolio is:
S = 1; b =

1
[(2a
2

1) (1

1= ) +

1]

(26)

Hence, full equity home bias (S = 1) appears for all preference parameters and any stochastic structure
of the two shocks. By contrast, the previous literature on portfolio choice in models with labor income
and a variable labor/capital share (e.g. Botazzi et al. (1996)) argued that equity home bias only arises
when output and the capital share are su¢ ciently negatively correlated. Note that, in contrast to most
of that literature, we here consider a world with multiple goods and the possibility to share risk using
bonds.
The predicted full equity home bias re‡ects the fact that holding local equity insulates household
income from capital share shocks; this is important, as the e¢ cient consumption allocation does not
depend on those shocks. Intuitively, capital share shocks entail that domestic equity returns are high
when domestic labor income is low (and vice-versa); this makes holding local equity attractive. Note that
6 Recall

that we assume

> 1.

13

this mechanism operates even when the unconditional correlation between labor and capital income is
positive (the unconditional correlation is positive when output shocks are su¢ ciently volatile, compared
to capital share shocks.).
More generally, any shock that takes away resources from consumers and redistributes them to …rms
would have the same e¤ect on portfolios as the capital share shocks discussed in this Section. The working
paper version of this paper shows that a model with output shocks and shocks to government purchases
generates the same portfolio as the model with output and capital share shocks.
Once capital share shocks have been hedged by holding local equity, the remaining output risk can be
hedged using the bond portfolio; this is so because output shocks induce terms of trade movements that
a¤ect the di¤erence between the returns on Home and Foreign good bonds. When S = 1 holds, then a
country’s net imports equal its net foreign bond income, as can readily seen from the budget constraints
(18) and (19). For country H: (PH =pF )CH

qyH = (q

1)b. In an e¢ cient equilibrium, a positive shock

to Home output always worsens the Home terms of trade (q); when the elasticity of substitution between
H and F goods is high, then Home net imports fall, in an e¢ cient equilibrium. For low substitution
elasticities, by contrast, net imports rise7 . There exists a threshold value of the substitution elasticity
between Home and Foreign goods

for which net imports are una¤ected by output shocks; that threshold

is roughly equal to unity–it is given by the value of

for which the right-hand side the equation that

determines b (see (26)) is zero8 .
b is positive (negative) when a domestic output increase lowers (raises) net imports. When

exceeds

the threshold, each country thus goes long in local-good bonds (and short in foreign-good bonds): this
ensures that an increase in the local endowment (which lowers the country’s terms of trade) triggers
a capital loss on the country’s bond portfolio, which induces the country to lower its net imports, as
prescribed by e¢ cient international risk sharing. By contrast, for low values of , the country goes short
in local good bonds; the terms of trade worsening that results from a positive domestic output shock
then leads to a capital gain that allows the country to …nance the e¢ cient increase in its net imports.
Empirically, industrialized countries have a positive (gross) foreign currency position; F CP > 0 (as
7 For example, it is easy to see that when the substitution elasticity is in…nite, then the country that receives a higher
output ships a fraction of the additional output to the other country, when there is e¢ cient risk sharing; hence the country
that receives the higher output lowers its net imports. When the two goods are imperfect substitutes, then term of trade
worsen, which dampens the fall in net imports (the relative price of imports rises).

(27)

The main conclusion is therefore that redistributive shocks provide a strong incentive to hold local
equity. However, in a world with just supply and redistributive shocks, the predicted foreign currency
position is realistic (F CP > 0) only for low substitution elasticities, namely for values of
smaller than unity, such that

< 1 holds (as can be see from (26)). (For

roughly

> 1, by contrast, investors

are long in local good bonds and short in foreign good bonds, so that a terms of trade depreciation is
associated with a wealth transfer from the country to the rest of the world). Note that

< 1 implies that

a positive shock to a country’s output worsens its terms of trade so strongly that the relative value of the
country’s output, at market prices (qy) drops (see (23)). Such a (relative) "immiserizing growth" e¤ect
seems implausible, at least among industrialized economies. We thus conclude that, in the model with
just supply and redistributive shocks, F CP > 0 and realistic valuation e¤ects only obtain for implausible
parameter con…gurations.

As before, capital share shocks are hedged by holding local equity (S = 1). iPod risk is hedged using
bonds. The bond position is structured in such a manner that external capital gains/losses track changes
in e¢ cient consumption spending induced by iPod shocks. A positive relative iPod shock (increase in

depreciates the Home real exchange rate (welfare based), as: RER

see (24)). Following this relative demand shock, country H terms of trade appreciate when

> 1; i.e.

when the elasticity of substitution is roughly speaking greater than unity (see (23)). When

> 1 holds,

country H thus experiences a decrease in its e¢ cient relative consumption spending, in states of the
world in which its terms of trade improve; in order to …nance e¢ cient consumption spending, the country
15

thus goes short in local-good bonds (b < 0); as a result, the gross foreign currency position is positive
(F CP > 0)9 .
Hence, a combination of demand and redistributive shocks helps to reproduce the broad facts presented
in the introduction: home bias in stocks, and a long position in foreign currency (short position in domestic
currency).

Characterization of world equilibrium with incomplete markets

Analytical results
Solution method

Complete markets provide a simple and useful benchmark for analyzing international portfolio behavior.
However, the complete markets assumption has some unrealistic implications; for example, it implies that
ratios of Home to Foreign marginal utilities of consumption are perfectly correlated with real exchange
rates; that prediction is rejected by the data (e.g., Kollmann (1991, 1995, 1996), Backus and Smith
(1993)). We now assume that the world economy is subjected to the three (relative) shocks simultaneously,
so that markets are incomplete.
The solution methods developed by Coeurdacier (2005), Devereux and Sutherland (2006) and van
Wincoop and Tille (2006) allow to compute equilibrium portfolios, in economies with incomplete markets.
Those methods solve for portfolio that satisfy a second order accurate approximation of household Euler
equations for the four assets:

relative iPod shock; Home terms of trade worsen when < 1; and thus, the relative value (at market prices) of the Home
endowment drops; hence, the H household needs to obtain a net external capital gain on its bond portfolio, in order to
…nance its (essentially) unchanged relative consumption spending. In this case too, the country thus goes short in local
good bonds.

Equilibrium portfolios

Devereux and Sutherland (2006) provide a closed form solution for the equilibrium portfolio. Under
incomplete markets, the portfolio depends on the correlation between shocks. We …rst focus on the
simplest case where the three relative shocks are uncorrelated (Sect. 5.3 extends the analysis to correlated

The equity portfolio depends on four terms. The …rst term (1=2) re‡ects the diversi…cation motive
in a single-good world with zero labor income. The second term represents the hedging of real exchange
rate risk which we discussed already in the complete market case (see section 4.4.1). Real exchange rate
hedging is now more complex, because of the larger number of shocks. The second term tends to generate
a foreign equity bias for su¢ ciently high substitution elasticities ( > 1)11 . Again, this term disappears
when preferences are identical across countries (no consumption home bias, a = 1=2), as then the real
exchange rate is constant. The third term comes from the redistributive shock and it tends to induce a
Home bias in stocks. When the redistributive shock is su¢ ciently large (more precisely when
relative to

2

and

2
y ),

2
k

is large

then there always is equity home bias, S > 1=2. The last term, again, represents

the foreign equity bias in a single-good world with labor income, in which the labor share is …xed (so
that labor and capital incomes are perfectly positively correlated).
Note also that with a substitution elasticity of unity ( = 1), full Home bias (S = 1) is obtained for
all con…gurations of parameters as long as the variance of the distribution shock

is not zero.

where S is given by (33).
(34) shows the relative importance of the demand and supply shocks for the structure of the bond
portfolio. For a substitution elasticity larger than 1 and interior portfolios (0 < S < 1), agents go short
on local good bonds (b < 0) and long on foreign-good bonds, when iPod shocks are large enough relative
to supply shocks. Intuitively, a negative iPod shock that deteriorates a country’s terms of trade also
deteriorates its relative output (evaluated at market prices); the shock can thus be hedged by holding
Foreign bonds (whose relative return rises when domestic terms of trade worsen).
In the economy with the three types of shocks, the foreign currency position is:

Quantitative analysis with incomplete markets
Calibration

In this Section, we calibrate the incomplete markets model with supply, demand and redistributive shocks.
The mean capital share across G7 countries is 40%, hence we set k = 0:4:

12

We computed standard

deviations of annual rates of change for real GDP growth and capital shares, for each G7 countries (19722003). Across the G7 countries, the mean standard deviations of (rates of change of) real GDP and the
capital share are 1.91% and 2.34%, respectively.

: We computed a country’s relative

real GDP and capital share, compared to a geometric average of the remaining G7 countries’GDPs and the
capital shares (1972-2003)13 . Relative outputs and capital shares undergo highly persistent ‡uctuations.
The mean value (across G7 countries) of standard deviations of annual growth rate of relative GDPs is
1.59%. For relative capital shares the corresponding mean standard deviation is 2.39%14 . For all countries,
1 2 We measure a country´ s capital share as 1-(compensation of employees)/(GDP-indirect taxes), using annual data from
OECD National Accounts.
1 3 The weights are based on countries’time-averaged shares in G7 nominal GDP.
1 4 The standard deviations of relative GDP growth rates for the US, Japan, Germany, France, UK, Italy and Canada are
1.7%, 2.1%, 1.2%, 1.44%, 1.5%, 1.6% and 1.5%, respectively. The corresponding standard deviations of growth rates of
relative capital shares are 2.1%, 2.5%, 1.6%, 2.0%, 3.7%, 1.9%, 2.8%.

19

the relative capital share is more volatile than relative GDP. In the calibrated model, we therefore set
std(yi ) = 1:91%; std(ki ) = 2:34%;

y

std(b
y ) = 1:59%,

std(b
k) = 2:39%.

As mentioned before, iPod shocks can have several interpretations, and their quanti…cation is less easy
than that of the other two shocks. Under one interpretation, iPod shocks re‡ect quality changes and/or
changes in the number of varieties produced by a country. Recent empirical evidence at a very disaggregated level by Broda and Weinstein (2007) suggests that quality/varieties changes are an important
phenomenon. In the model here, portfolios and other endogenous variables only depend on the relative
std( b ) = 1%,

iPod shock. We experiment with two values for the volatility of relative iPod shocks,
and

= 2%, i.e. in one case the iPod shock is less volatile than relative output, while in the other case,

it is slightly more volatile than relative output. We also report results for the case where std( b ) = 0. In

that case, there are only supply and capital share shocks, and markets are complete.

Across G7 countries, the mean imports/GDP ratio (1972-2003) is 20%. Hence, we set a = 0:8.
The substitution elasticity
estimates of

equals the price elasticity of foreign trade ‡ows. A wide range of empirical

has been reported. Hooper and Marquez (1995) survey a large number of time-series studies

that estimated (long run) price elasticities of aggregate trade ‡ows, for the US, Japan, Germany, the UK
and Canada; the median estimates (post-Bretton Woods era) for those countries are 0.97, 0.80, 0.57, 0.6,
and 1.01, respectively. The median estimate across the …ve countries is 0.88. We here consider a range
of values of :

= 0:6; 0:9; 1:5; 2. That range encompasses most values of

that have been assumed in

recent quantitative macro/…nance models; see, e.g. Kollmann (2006b), Heathcote and Perri (2002), and

partially) capture quality/variety changes (see Broda and Weinstein (2007)). Also, purely psychological
demand shocks are not re‡ected in o¢ cial consumption data.
Markets are complete when there are no iPod shocks (

= 0). 100% equity home bias (S = 1) is

then obtained, and countries hold a long position in local-good bonds if
with

> 1. In the model versions

> 1, the long position in home currency is sizable (it amounts to 22% of expected output, when

= 1:5). This is just a restatement of the puzzle presented before; with supply shocks and redistributive
shocks only, the model is unable to reproduce a long position in foreign currency for an elasticity of
substitution larger than 1: Introducing iPod shocks reduces the equity home bias, and holdings of localgood bonds, when the substitution elasticity exceeds unity. For example, when

= 1:5, and

= 2%; the

model predicts that 75% of equity is locally owned, and that countries goes short in local-good bonds; the
overall foreign good claim is positive, F CP = 0:14; that value implies that an exogenous unexpected 10%
worsening of a country’s terms of trade would generate a capital gain that represents 1:4% (= 0:10 0:14)
of (expected) output. We think of this calibration as a plausible benchmark case.
Kollmann (2006b) reports external equity liabilities (de…ned as the sum of portfolio equity and FDI
liabilities) of OECD economies, in 2003 (data source: IMF international investment positions database).
US foreign equity liabilities amounted to 37% of US GDP. Among G7 countries, foreign equity liabilities
represented between 12% (Italy) and 78% (UK) of domestic GDP. Assuming that the domestic capital
stock is about 3 times larger than annual GDP, these …gures suggest that between 74% and 96% of the
capital stocks located in G7 countries were owned by local investors, in 2003. The predicted locally held
equity share in the three-shocks model is thus broadly consistent with G7 data.
The cross-country correlations of equity returns given in Table 2 range between 0:6 and 0:7. The model
thus matches the high correlation of stock returns across G7 countries, 0:63.

16

This high correlation

re‡ects the high positive correlation of output and capital share shocks across countries;17 it also re‡ects
terms-of-trade movements (Cole and Obstfeld (1991), Pavlova and Rigobon (2004)): a positive output
shock at home raises the relative price of the foreign good— it, hence, raises stock returns, in both
1 6 For

each G7 country, we computed the correlation between the Home real equity return and the “foreign” (rest-of G7)
equity return, where (as in the theoretical model), all returns are expressed in units of Home GDP. The mean Home-Foreign
equity return correlation is 0.63 (based on annual MSCI returns for 1972-1994).
1 7 Among the model predictions shown in Table 2, only the cross-country correlation of equity returns depends on the
cross-country correlations of output and of the capital share. In accordance with the mean statistics across G7 countries
discussed above, we set the standard deviations of output and the capital share in each country at 1.91% and 2.34%,
respectively. The implied cross-country correlations of output and the capital share are 0.65 and 0.47, respectively.

The …nance literature has shown that real exchange rate ‡uctuations generate a hedging motive in
portfolio choice. van Wincoop and Warnock (2006) discuss a partial equilibrium model, without labor
income, in which the only assets are Home and Foreign stocks. In that model, equity home bias is an

zero, then equity home bias is zero, i.e. equity portfolios are perfectly diversi…ed: S = 1=2. van Wincoop
and Warnock (2006) document that, empirically the covariance-variance ratio is close to zero18 ; they thus
conclude that the “portfolio home bias associated with hedging real exchange rate risk is essentially zero”
(p.11). Simple general equilibrium models driven by supply shocks (without demand or redistributive
shocks) can only generate equity home bias, if the implied "covariance-variance ratio" is much larger than
that observed in the data. As discussed above, in the model here, capital share shocks create a powerful
motive for holding local equity; those shocks induce equity return ‡uctuation that are disconnected from
real exchange rate movements. Also, in the setting here, bonds can be used for hedging real exchange
rate risk. This enables the present model to simultaneously generate a realistic equity home bias, and to
generate a covariance-variance ratio that is close to zero (see column (6) in Table 2).
van Wincoop and Warnock (2006) also discuss a model with trade in stocks and in Home and Foreign
bonds; when there are neither capital share nor iPod shocks, the degree of equity home bias depends on
a covariance-variance ratio based on components of excess equity returns and of the real exchange rate
that are orthogonal to exchange rate movements; empirically, that conditional covariance-variance ratio
is essentially zero. In the present model, the conditional covariance-variance ratio is exactly zero.
Under complete markets, the risk sharing condition (16) implies that, up to a linear approximation,
relative aggregate consumption is perfectly negatively correlated with the (welfare-based) real exchange
rate; see Kollmann (1991, 1995), and Backus and Smith (1993). Empirically, the consumption-real
exchange correlation is close to zero (mean correlation for G7 countries: 0.04 (1972-2003)).
Incomplete markets break the perfect correlation between relative consumption and the welfare-based
real exchange rate; iPod shocks further weaken the link between measured relative consumption and the
measured real exchange rate, when empirical CPI and real consumption measures do not (or only par1 8 For

tially) capture quality/variety changes. However, in the model here, the predicted correlation between
(measured) relative consumption and the (measured) RER remains too large (in absolute value), compared to the data (see Table 2, column (8)). For the speci…cations where we obtain the most realistic
foreign asset positions, the correlation is around -0.5 (for example, when

= 1:5 and

= 2%, the

consumption-real exchange rate correlation is -0.56). So even though we are going in the right direction,
we cannot quantitatively reproduce the low consumption-real exchange rate correlation observed in the
data.
We have also studied more in detailed how our results vary with the substitution elasticity . When
the standard deviation of the iPod shock has an intermediate value of 1:5%, our results are quite robust
to setting

at values in the range up to 4 or 5, i.e. at values that are much larger than those generally

used in macro/…nance models (but closer to elasticities often used in the trade literature). The equity
home bias never falls below 60%. We have also checked that our results are quite insensitive to changes
in the risk aversion coe¢ cient (a higher coe¢ cient of risk aversion raises slightly foreign stock and bond
holdings).

5.3

Correlated shocks

In this section, we consider model variants with correlated relative shocks. Under complete markets,
equilibrium portfolios do not depend on shock correlations. When markets are incomplete, by contrast,
the correlation structure a¤ects portfolios (markets remain incomplete, as long as the correlation between
shocks is not 100%). In what follows, we thus assume a setting with all three shocks (incomplete markets).
We …rst consider a case in which relative supply and redistributive shocks are correlated (but independent
of iPod shocks).
5.3.1

Correlation between supply and redistributive shocks

In the Handbook of Macroeconomics, Rotemberg and Woodford (1999), report several measures of the
correlation between output and the labor share. They conclude that the labor share is weakly countercyclical; in other terms, the capital share is weakly positively correlated with output.19 In the model
1 9 A possible explanation for a procyclical capital share is given by Gali (1999) who argues that, when prices are sticky,
productivity shocks reduce labor demand and employment, and raise the labor share, in the short run. This is the mechanism
at work in Engel and Matsumoto’s (2004) two-country portfolio choice model with monopolistic competition.

24

here, equilibrium portfolios depend on the correlation between relative (Home versus Foreign) output and
the relative capital share. Across G7 countries (1972-2003), the mean correlation between annual growth
rates of relative GDP and relative capital shares is about 20%.20 For the US, the correlation is close to
zero.
When there is a non-zero correlation between (relative) supply and redistributive shocks, the equilibrium portfolio is given by equation (36) in the Appendix. As in the zero-correlation case, stock holdings
can again be decomposed into four terms that capture di¤erent diversi…cation/hedging motives, but these
terms are now more complex. The real exchange rate hedging motive (see second term in (36)) becomes
stronger. Intuitively, the covariance between equity returns and output is higher when output is positively
correlated with the capital share; as a result, the covariance between the real exchange rate and equity
returns is lower (when

> 1), which pushes towards less equity home bias21 . Also, with a procyclical

capital share, wages are more stable, which dampens the incentive to hedge wage ‡uctuations through
the holding of domestic stocks (see the third term in (36)).
This helps to understand why a positive correlation between shocks reduces somewhat the degree of
equity home bias, as can be seen from table 3, where we consider model variants in which the correlation
between (relative) supply and capital share shocks are set at 0, 0:2 and 0:4, respectively (Table 3 assumes
= 1:5 and

= 2%; all remaining parameters are set at the same values as in table 2). For example,

when the shock correlation is 0:2 (the mean empirical correlation for G7 countries), then 68% of stocks
are held locally (compared to 75% in the zero-correlation case).
The predicted Foreign Currency Position (F CP = (1

S) k

b) remains positive which is consistent

with the data. In fact, FCP tends to be larger, the higher the correlation between output and capital
share shocks; this mainly re‡ects the fact that equity home bias is lower when the correlation is higher.

2 0 The construction of the relative output and capital share series is discussed above. The correlations for the individual
G7 countries are: US: -0.04; Japan: 0.05; Germany: 0.27; France: -0.03; UK: 0.22; Italy: 0.75; Canada: 0.44.

Correlation between supply and iPod shocks

Finally, we consider a setting in which (relative) supply and iPod shocks are correlated. Under the
interpretation of iPod shocks as pure preference shocks, there is no reason to think that these two
shocks are correlated. However, if iPod shocks represent changes in the quality of goods (or in the
number of varieties), one may believe that the two shocks are somewhat related. For example, when
labor productivity rises because of human capital accumulation, this could both increase output and
the quality of goods (or give an incentives to introduce new varieties). The equilibrium portfolio under
correlated supply and iPod shocks is given in the Appendix (equation (38)).
There are no precise empirical estimates of the correlation between output and quality/varieties
changes. Broda and Weinstein (2007) report that, for the US, the net creation of product varieties is procyclical and that the destruction of varieties is counter-cyclical. At a highly disaggregated product group
level, the correlation between the net rate of creation of product varieties and the growth of consumption
and of sales ranges roughly between 0.1 and 0.4.
In Table 3, we report model prediction for output-iPod shock correlations of 0; 0:2 and 0:4.22 It again
appears that our main results are robust. A positive correlation between productivity and iPod shocks
lowers somewhat the Home bias in stocks but increase the Foreign Currency Position23 .
2 2 We

again assume = 1:5 and
= 2%; and set all remaining parameters are set at the same values as in table 2
relationship between the output-iPod shock correlation and home bias in stocks is non-monotonic: for higher
correlations, S rises (S converges towards 1 as the correlation approaches unity).

Conclusion

This paper has shown that a model with supply, demand and redistributive shocks can help to understand
the structure of international portfolios and associated valuation e¤ects. This is in contrast to standard
models that focus on supply shocks as the main source of uncertainty.
Our analysis could be extended in several directions. It would be interesting to model more closely
the relation between goods supply and the capital share. This could, for example, be done by introducing
sticky prices. With nominal rigidities, productivity shocks generate a procylical capital share. It would
also be interesting to model in greater detail the relation between supply and demand shocks, especially
when we interpret the latter as shocks to the quality or the number of variates of traded goods. Here,
one might follow Corsetti, Martin and Pesenti (2007) who show that terms of trade react di¤erently to
productivity shocks that a¤ect the unit cost of goods production, and to productivity shocks that a¤ect
the cost of creating new varieties. One can also speculate that, in a model with imperfect competition,
shocks to the degree of competition and to mark-ups would combine the properties of redistributive and
relative demand shocks, and thus help to produce realistic international portfolios, as such shocks likewise
redistribute income between capital and labor. We leave those extensions for future research.
