We couch our analysis in a stochastic equilibrium model anchored with US evidence on gross factor flows and on rents in worker and firm income.  We develop a social accounting framework to measure the costs of transactional impediments.  We calculate the average social loss associated with structural unemployment and low productivity -- due to technological  sclerosis' and a  scrambling' of productivity rankings in entry and exit decisions.  We also estimate the loss from a recession.  An additional forty percent to the traditional unemployment cost is due to reduced productivity and is determined by the recession's cumulative effect on the economy's churn rate.  Although a recessionary shock increases the economy's  turbulence' at impact, semi-structural VAR evidence from US manufacturing indicates that, cumulatively, it results in a  chill' -- which is costly in an economy that suffers from sclerosis.\n\n",
