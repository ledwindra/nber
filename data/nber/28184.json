    "abstract": "\n\nWe propose an approach to identifying economic shocks (monetary, growth, and risk-premium news) from stock returns and Treasury yield changes, which allows us to study the drivers of asset prices at a daily frequency since the early 1980s. We apply the identification to examine investors\u2019 responses to news from the Fed and key macro announcements. We uncover two risk-premium shocks\u2014time-varying compensation for discount-rate and cash-flow news\u2014which have distinct effects on stocks and bonds. Since the mid-1990s, the Fed-induced reductions in both risk premium sources have generated high average stock returns but an ambiguous response in bonds on FOMC days.\n\n",
