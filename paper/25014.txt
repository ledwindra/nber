ABSTRACT
The intermittency of payment for many goods creates a disconnect between paying and
consuming such that the marginal price is not always salient when consumption decisions are
made. This paper derives optimal dynamic corrective taxes when there are externalities as well as
internalities from inattention and persistence in consumption across periods. Our optimal taxes
address dynamic inefficiencies that are not captured in static models of inattention. We also
characterize a second-best constant tax and the excess burden associated with time-invariant tax
rates. We then calibrate the model to U.S. residential electricity consumption.

1. Introduction
The standard economic remedy to externality problems has been well known since the
1920s and has been a regular fixture in the policy makers toolkit since at least the 1980s.
The idea is simple, yet elegant. Impose a tax equal to marginal external damages in order to
internalize externalities and generate private decision making that is socially optimal (Pigou,
1920). But in an increasingly cashless society where the financial consequences of ones daily
choices may only be experienced monthly or even quarterly, is it realistic to expect consumers
to optimally perform this calculation? Indeed, an emerging literature that examines the
impacts of price salience on purely private decisions suggests that this is unlikely to be the
case across a range of contexts (DellaVigna, 2009; Finkelstein, 2009; Sexton, 2015; Grubb
and Osborne, 2015; Karlan, et. al., 2016).
This so-called inattention problem raises the specter of additional policy interventions
that increase salience in order to fix the internality from privately suboptimal decision making (Chetty et al., 2009; Chetty, 2009; Allcott et al., 2014; Allcott and Taubinsky, 2015;
Farhi and Gabaix, 2018).1 The implications for a simple static setting are straightforward
– impose a super tax that forces consumers to face the full internal (i.e. salient-equivalent)
and external costs. This logic becomes more complex in a dynamic setting with a more
realistic representation of price salience as intermittent. The optimal (time-varying) tax will
now depend on both the persistence of consumption across periods and the degree to which
consumers are forward-looking in their behavior. Consumption persistence can arise for a
host of reasons, including habits, status quo bias, or complementarity with durable goods
(e.g. Becker and Murphy, 1988; Benhabib and Bisin, 2005; Flavin and Nakagawa, 2008;
Landry, 2018). Moreover, recent research has shown that consumption persistence is an important consideration in the welfare effects of a corrective policy (Costa and Gerard, 2018).
Our work extends their key insights by showing that these welfare effects are compounded
by time-varying inattention and demonstrating the importance of both persistence and inattention for the design of optimal and second-best policy. Importantly for policy design, this
persistence provides a vehicle through which forward-looking agents can commit to future
paths of consumption.
In this paper, we develop a model of consumer behavior when prices are intermittently
salient, demand persists across periods, and consumption creates external damages. We

then derive optimal dynamic tax rules for three distinct types of consumers: a fully naive
agent who is myopic about her consumption persistence and not sophisticated about future
inattention; a partially naive agent who dynamically optimizes her consumption persistence
under perceived prices but is not sophisticated about future price inattention; and a sophisticated agent who dynamically optimizes her consumption persistence under perceived prices,
with sophistication about future inattention to prices. Our work builds on the static models
of corrective policy with externalities and internalities developed by Allcott, et al. (2014)
and Allcott and Taubinsky (2015) by evaluating a fully dynamic setting with time-varying
inattention and consumption persistence.2
We find that the optimal time-varying tax depends upon the price-elasticity of demand
and the size of external damages, as well as a number of parameters that govern the dynamic
nature of the problem including the attention decay function, price salience, consumption
persistence, and time preference parameters. In general, sophisticated types face lower taxes
than either of the naive types, with the size of these differences quite sensitive to the habit
persistence and salience parameters. Greater intertemporal consumption linkages resulting
from habit persistence lead to higher taxes for the fully naive agent during all periods; lower
taxes for the sophisticated one during the salient period only; and have no effect on taxes
for the partially naive individual. The effects of salience are slightly different. Greater levels
of inattention lead to higher taxes for all agents during non-salient periods. During salient
periods, greater levels of future inattention have no effect on the optimal tax for fully or
partially naive agents but lead to lower taxes for sophisticated ones.
When regulators are constrained to a time-invariant tax, the optimal constant tax is
second-best. We find that the second-best constant tax rate is an exact weighted-average of
the optimal dynamic tax in each period, in which the weights now depend on the parameters
for price-elasticity of demand, the attention decay function, price salience, consumption
persistence, and time preference. This second-best tax balances under-consumption during
the salient period with over-consumption during the non-salient period. Second-best taxes
are lowest for sophisticated agents and highest for fully naive agents.
Because time-invariant taxes are suboptimal, the welfare effects of suboptimal consumption in each period spill over into each other time period through realized or anticipated
2

Allcott, et al. (2014) and Allcott and Taubinsky (2015) model adoption of a durable good whose
utilization may generate externalities. Although durable goods have dynamic implications in the sense that
the impacts of decisions will be felt across time, adoption and utilization are one-shot decisions in these
models. In contrast, we model a recurrent purchase over an infinite time horizon with periodically salient
price signals.

consumption persistence. We derive formulas for these welfare effects that incorporate dynamic spillovers and can be calculated for any time-invariant tax rate. We then evaluate
these welfare formulas under three candidate tax rates: our second-best constant tax, a
“static” tax that is the optimal tax from a static model of price salience and therefore ignores dynamic inefficiency, and the standard Pigouvian tax equal to the marginal externality.
The welfare losses from time-invariant taxes are largest for fully naive agents.
Our theoretical work is following by a numerical calibration for U.S. residential electricity
consumption. The optimal tax for the fully naive agent is several times larger than that for
the sophisticated one. The optimal tax for the partially naive agents lies between them. In all
cases, the optimal tax rises as attention decays, arriving at a level between three and twelve
times larger than the simple Pigouvian tax that neglects inattention. The second-best tax
regime, which leads to lower-than-optimal tax rates during non-salient periods and higherthan-optimal tax rates during salient periods, exacerbates the differences across agent types.
The excess burden from the second-best tax ranges from about 19 dollars per household
for partially naive agents to about 115 dollars per household for fully naive agents. With
approximately 126 million households in the U.S., this amounts to between 2.4 billion and
14.5 billion dollars in deadweight loss from the electricity sector, even if the second-best
optimal tax is implemented. These welfare losses rise sharply if the tax is reduced from the
second-best level, if inattention is more severe, or if demand is more elastic. For example,
the welfare loss associated with having no tax at all ranges from 181 dollars per household
for sophisticated agents to 4,560 dollars per household for fully naive agents.
The key insights from our model are not limited to electricity markets and should be
relevant for any price-based policy designed to address market failures, where price/cost
inattention and linked intertemporal decision making are commonplace. For example, gasoline consumption 1) emits several types of pollutants; 2) depends on vehicle type and driving
habits that persist across many periods; and 3) does not present drivers with explicit, salient
prices when making trip-level decisions. Similarly, unhealthy food choices 1) impose health
costs on society; 2) are sometimes habit-forming, such that enjoyment in the current period
depends on consumption in prior periods; and 3) are generally made at higher frequency
than the purchases that make their costs salient. The increasing prevalence of auto-billing
and subscription services for a range of purchases will only increase its applicability.
In the next section, we set up the model, derive optimal and second-best taxes, and derive
formulas for the welfare loss from time-invariant taxes. The subsequent section presents the
results from the numerical simulation. The final section discusses and concludes.

2. Model
We first describe the economic environment and characterize the private solution for three
types of agents:
• a fully naive agent who is myopic about her habit persistence and not sophisticated
about future inattention;
• a partially naive agent who dynamically optimizes her habit persistence under perceived prices but is not sophisticated about future price inattention;
• a sophisticated agent who dynamically optimizes her habit persistence under perceived
prices, with sophistication about future inattention to prices.
2.1. Model Setup
Utility in each period depends on consumption of a clean numeraire good yt , a dirty
good xt , and past consumption of the dirty good, αxt−1 . The parameter α governs the
persistence of consumption decisions across time. Consumption of the dirty good produces
social damages proportional to current consumption that last only for the current period:
Dt = φxt .

(1)

Here, φ is the marginal external cost of damages associated with consumption of x.
For simplicity we model period utility as quasilinear:
Ut = ut (xt − αxt−1 ) + yt

(2)

where subscripts on Ut and ut are used only to index the time period (the functional forms
are assumed to be the same in all periods). Consumption of x in adjacent time periods
are “adjacent complements” in the sense that as xt−1 increases, the marginal utility of xt
rises in period t and consumption of xt increases ceteris paribus. This type of intertemporal dependence can arise if a good is habit-forming (Becker and Murphy, 1988), when
consumption is based on defaults or status quo bias (Samuelson and Zeckhauser, 1988) or
when consumption depends on some durable good stock (Flavin and Nakagawa, 2008). For
simplicity, we will refer to the dirty good as habit forming, where the α parameter governs
consumption persistence through the effect of past consumption on the utility of current
consumption. This provides the agent a commitment mechanism by which to mitigate potential future overconsumption by reducing present consumption in order to change habits,
5

if the agent is sophisticated about future inattention3 . We ignore saving and borrowing so
that the household faces a budget constraint in each period:
m = pxt + yt ,

(3)

where m denotes per period household wealth and p is the price of the dirty good. This
simplification allows us to focus on the dynamic relationship from hysteresis rather than the
intertemporal transfer of financial resources4 .
The price of the dirty good is intermittently salient. To fix ideas, consider a monthly bill.
Agents receive a salient price signal in period 1, which we can think of as receiving a bill
on the first day of the billing cycle. The price may remain salient for a number of periods
i = 1, ..., I with I < T . Let us call this the “salient window”. The price is definitively not
salient from period I + 1 until the end of the cycle in period T - the “insalient window”. In
period T + 1 the agents receive another salient price signal (a new bill) and the cycle repeats.
Agents live for an infinite number of cycles indexed by M .
It is our contention that agents are more attentive to prices the more recently the price
signal was received. We model this feature of attention decay by assuming that the probability of perceiving the true price is equal to 1 in period 1 and declines to zero by period I
as follows:
i−1
I −1
With probability µi , the agent remembers the price signal in period i and optimizes with
respect to the true price. With probability (1 − µi ), the agent is not thinking about the price
signal in period i - the price is not salient to the agent - and the agent makes optimization
errors.
If the price of x is not salient, agents are less responsive to prices than when they are
fully salient, and therefore overconsume the dirty good.5 We represent this by having agents
µi = 1 −

3

This model has a similar structure to a model of status quo bias with an endogneous status quo, in
which past choices affect the current default decision. Introducing borrowing and savings, a single permanent
income constraint, or durable goods stock accumulation, would provide a similar dynamic mechanism. We
focus on habits because they are an empirical feature of the polluting goods we are interested in, and because
intermittent price salience has important implications for habit formation.
4
This simplification also allows us to avoid theoretical cases where a sophisticated household could be so
concerned about future overconsumption that it would “raid” its savings in the present and leave nothing
to be wasted by suboptimal decisions in the future.
5
Although it is possible that agents underconsume when prices are not salient, empirical evidence suggests

6

undervalue the true price by a salience factor θ ∈ (0, 1) and optimize as if their period budget
constraint was:
m = θpxt + yt
(4)
During the salient window, the agent correctly perceives the budget constraint in equation
(3) with probability µi , and with probability (1 − µi ) incorrectly acts as if equation (4) is the
budget constraint. During the insalient window the perceived budget constraint is equation
(4). This cycle repeats for periods T + 1 to 2T , and so on.
2.2. Private optimization
In the first time period, when the perceived price corresponds to the true price, the agent
optimizes the following equation:
max

{xtM ,ytM }

(5)

s.t. x0 given
where β is the discount factor and M indexes a cycle of length T periods, i.e., a billing cycle.
In contrast, once I periods have passed, the price is definitively not salient and the agent’s
maximization problem can be expressed as:
max

t=I+1

s.t. x0 , ..., xI given
(6)
From the point of view of period I + 1, the agent perceives the price to be θp and applies
this price to their optimal consumption plan through the end of the current billing cycle and
all future cycles M = 2, ..., ∞.
During periods 1 < i ≤ I (the salient window), with probability µi the agent perceives
the true price and solves a problem of the type in equation (5); with probability (1 − µi ) the
agent is inattentive to the price and solves a problem of the type in equation (6).
When setting optimal taxes, the regulator does not know whether the agent is in an
attentive or inattentive state in period i. The regulator is therefore interested in the solution
to the expected objective function
overconsumption is generally prevalent.

(7)
As time passes following the initial salient price signal, the agent becomes increasingly
likely to optimize relative to the perceived price θp rather than the true price p. The regulator
incorporates this transition into the optimal tax sequence as we will show.
2.2.1. Fully Naive and Partially Naive Agents
The fully naive agent takes xt−1 as given in each time period and is not forward-looking
about the persistent impacts of today’s consumption on tomorrow’s utility. Instead, the agent
passively adapts to historical consumption and optimizes under current perceived prices.6
The consumption plan chosen during the insalient window (I + 1 ≤ t ≤ T ) by the fully naive
household is defined by the first order conditions:
u0t = θp, t = I + 1, ..., T
u0sM = θp, s = 1, ..., T ; M = 2, ..., ∞

(8)

We model partially naive agents as Becker-Murphy rational habit formers who are naive
about future inattention. We assume they are forward-looking about consumption persistence. This feature is consistent with empirical evidence of consumption persistence, including estimates of habit persistence and cases in which consumption persistence occurs
through investment in a complementary durable good. In this case agents consider how
today’s decisions affect their future demands, even if they fail to recognize how their price
inattention will change in the future. The first order conditions for the consumption plan
made by the partially naive agent during the insalient window are
6

An alternative example to habit persistence is status quo bias. If status quo behavior is a function of
decision history, then decisions will be persistent but will not respond to expected future changes in the
status quo.

u0t − αβu0t+1 = θp,
u0sM − αβu0s+1,M = θp,

t = I + 1, ..., T
s = 1, ..., T ; M = 2, ..., ∞

During the salient window, t = i ≤ I, the probability of perceiving the true price is µi .
The regulator’s objective is to set an optimal period i tax that incorporates perceived prices.
Neither of the naive agent types foresees insalient prices (θ < 1) in future periods, and the
fully naive agent also does not foresee the effect of today’s consumption on future demand.
From the point of view of the regulator, we can represent the period i objective function for
either of these agent types as

(9)
The fully naive agent is myopic about consumption persistence and takes xt−1 as given in
each period when optimizing (9). Partially naive agents, on the other hand, dynamically
optimize (9) over xt−1 = xt−1 .
In the fully naive case, during the salient window the regulator faces an agent whose
consumption plan solves
u0t = p, t = i, ..., T
u0sM = p, s = 1, ..., T ; M = 2, ..., ∞

(10)

with probability µi , and with probability (1 − µi ) the agent’s consumption plan solves
u0t = θp, t = i, ..., T
u0sM = θp, s = 1, ..., T ; M = 2, ..., ∞.

(11)

In effect, the first order condition that is relevant for the regulator’s tax-setting problem is
u0t = p · (µi + (1 − µi )θ) , t = i, ..., T
u0sM = p · (µi + (1 − µi )θ) , s = 1, ..., T ; M = 2, ..., ∞

9

(12)

Note that if either µi = 1 or θ = 1, the marginal utility is equal to the price as in the
standard model.
For partially naive agents during periods during the salient window, the first order condition relevant for the regulator’s tax-setting problem is
u0t − αβu0t+1 = p · (µi + (1 − µi )θ), t = i, ..., T
u0sM − αβu0s+1,M = p · (µi + (1 − µi )θ), s = 1, ..., T ; M = 2, ..., ∞

(13)

where, in comparison to the fully naive agent, the partially naive agent considers the effect
of consumption persistence on future utility.
2.2.2. Sophisticated Agents
From the standpoint of a period in the insalient window, the sophisticated agent’s solution
to (6) is forward-looking about habit formation but is subject to optimization errors from
inattention (θ):
u0t − αβu0t+1 = θp, t = I + 1, ..., T
u0sM − αβu0s+1,M = θp, s = 1, ..., T ; M = 2, ..., ∞

(14)

These first order conditions are identical to those of the partially naive agent during the
insalient window; the agent behaves in a sophisticated way only during periods in which
they are attentive to the true price.
By recursive substitution of (14), we obtain
P
u0tM = (αβ)τ −1 + θp τs=0 (αβ)s
P
s
=⇒ u0tM ≈ θp ∞
s=0 (αβ) = θpR

(15)

P
1
s
where R = ∞
s=0 (αβ) = 1−αβ .
Let the consumption plan defined by (15) be
x̂tM = x̂tM (xt−1,M , p; θ), ŷtM = ŷtM (xt−1,M , p; θ),

(16)

where this is the consumption plan made in period I + 1 of the current cycle that the agent
expects to carry out from I + 1 through all future periods and all future cycles. Note that
x̂tM is larger than the privately optimal demand with fully salient prices (and ŷtM is smaller)
because x is overconsumed out of the budget when the price is not salient.
Consider the agent’s decision during the salient window, when agents may or may not
10

perceive the true price. We model sophistication about inattention as follows. If the agent
does not perceive the true price in some period t ≤ I during the salient window, the agent
will behave according to (15). If the agent perceives the true price in the current period, then
the agent expects to pay that price for consumption in the current and all future periods, but
expects to make future consumption decisions according to (16). In addition, she considers
how the current consumption decision will shift those future demand functions. These future
demands enter the agent’s effective period i objective function as follows:

The first term in brackets is the marginal utility across time taking consumption persistence into account. This would be equal to the price during period 1 (when prices are fully
11

salient) if the agent did not demand commitment to avoid future inattention, captured by
the effects of xi on future x̂. Each term in brackets inside the large parentheses is negative.
These terms measure the extent of the deviation from a private optimum in future periods
due to salience effects. Because the agent is overconsuming in the future, the marginal utilities across time fall below the price. The sophisticated agent anticipates these deviations.
Denote the period i demand that solves equation (18) as x̂i (xi−1 , p; θ). This is lower than the
privately optimal demand would be in the absence of salience effects, as the sophisticated
agent tries to use persistence as a commitment device for a lower consumption path.

salience effects to avoid (θ = 1), or if there are no habits (or no commitment mechanism
by which to avoid salience effects, i.e., α = 0) then δ = 0. If in addition µi = 1, then the
problem collapses to a standard period 1 private optimum for habit formation with the price
on the right hand side.
2.2.3. Summary of privately optimal consumption paths
In the absence of internalities from inattention and naivety about persistence, equating
the left hand side of (19) to the price in all time periods will yield the true privately optimal
consumption path. By contrast, sophisticated agents underconsume relative to the private
optimum when µi is close to one and overconsume as µi approaches zero, so that consumption
rises in expectation throughout the salient window. Comparing the sophisticated agent
conditions in (19) to those for the partially naive agent in (13), notice that they differ by
the presence of (1 + δ). Although consumption also rises throughout the salient window for
partially naive agents, these agents consume at the true private optimum in the first period
and then overconsume in all other periods. Lastly, comparing the sophisticated agent’s
conditions for periods during the insalient window in (15) to those for the fully naive agent
in (8), we can see that they differ by the presence of R for the sophisticated agents. The
marginal utility of consumption is therefore larger for sophisticated agents than fully naive
12

agents during the insalient window, which indicates that overconsumption in the later part
of the billing cycle is more severe for fully naive agents. Similarly during the salient window
the marginal utility of consumption differs in each period by a factor of R; for the fully
naive agent the marginal utility is equated to p · (µi + (1 − µi )θ) in expectation whereas the
sophisticated agent sets marginal utility equal to p · (µi + (1 − µi )θ) · R in expectation. Again,
the fully naive agent always consumes more than the sophisticated agent. Further, the true
private optimum sets marginal utility in a given period equal to p + αβu0t+1 . Therefore, the
fully naive agent also always overconsumes relative to the true private optimum.
2.3. Optimal Dynamic Corrective Taxes
Consumption will deviate from the socially optimal path because of the internalities
outlined at the end of the previous subsection, and because of externalities (φ) generated
by consumption of the dirty good. A system of optimal corrective taxes must address both
sources of inefficiency. In this subsection we set up the social planner’s problem and solve
for the dynamic corrective taxes that induce each agent type to consume along the socially
optimal path.
Assuming a rate of time preference equal to the interest rate, the social planner chooses
a path {xt , yt }∞
t=1 to maximize the intertemporal social welfare function
W =

∞
X

β t−1 [Ut (xt , yt , xt−1 ) − φxt − λt (pxt + yt − m)]

(20)

t=1

subject to x0 given. Note that the social planner optimizes over all time periods regardless
of the billing cycle. For the rest of this subsection we drop the M subscript and use the t
and i subscripts to denote the position within a given cycle. The optimal path is defined by
the first order conditions:
u0t − αβu0t+1 = p + φ,

t = 1...∞

(21)

One implication of (21) is that absent inattention or naivety about persistence, a tax τ at
the standard Pigouvian rate of τ = φ would induce households to consume at the social
optimum. By recursive substitution of (21), we obtain
P
u0t = (αβ)τ −1 u0τ + (p + φ) τs=0 (αβ)s
P
s
≈ (p + φ) ∞
s=0 (αβ) = (p + φ) R.

(22)

The socially optimal per-period marginal utility is increased (and per-period consumption is
13

restrained) by consideration of both the external costs φ and the recursive impact of today’s
consumption on future consumption through habit persistence, or the effect of α through R.
Let j ∈ {F, P, S} denote fully naive, partially naive, and sophisticated agent types,
respectively. Each agent type j could be induced to consume along the optimal path by a
dynamic tax that transforms their private first order conditions in each period into the social
planner’s first order conditions from (22).
During the insalient window of the billing cycle, this would be an extra large tax τtj (θ)
which is different for agent type j. For fully naive agents F the optimal tax must solve
u0t = θ(p + τtF (θ)) = (p + φ)R,

t = I + 1, ..., T,

(23)

whereas for partially naive and sophisticated agents the optimal tax must solve
u0tM = θ(p + τtj (θ))R = (p + φ)R,

j ∈ {P, S}, t = I + 1, ..., T.

(24)

The optimal taxes during the salient window of the billing cycle can be found in a similar
manner. For fully naive agents, the optimal tax must solve
u0i = (p + τiF (θ)) · (µi + (1 − µi )θ) = (p + φ)R,

i = 1, ..., I,

(25)

for partially naive agents, the optimal tax solves
u0i = (p + τiP (θ)) · (µi + (1 − µi )θ) R = (p + φ)R,

i = 1, ..., I,

(26)

and for sophisticated agents the optimal tax solves
u0i = (p + τiS (θ)) · (µi (1 + δ) + (1 − µi )θ) R = (p + φ)R,

i = 1, ..., I,

(27)

The set of taxes that solves all of these conditions is exactly that which transforms each
agent’s first order conditions from equations (8), (9), and (15) in periods t = I + 1, ..., T ,
and from equations (12), (13), and (19) in periods i = 1, ..., I, into the social planner’s first
order conditions in (22). The solution is stated in the following proposition.
Proposition 1. The optimal corrective taxes are time-varying and their magnitudes depend
on the forward-looking behavior of the households, i.e., whether households are fully naive
(F ), partially naive (P ), or sophisticated (S), as well as how recently a salient price signal
was received. In order to conserve notation and display a single set of formulas for all
1
for fully naive agents and Rj = 1 for sophisticated and
agent types, let Rj = R = 1−αβ
14

partially naive agents. Further, let δj = 0 for fully and partially naive agents and δj = δ for
sophisticated agents. Then for t = I + 1, ..., T,

µi (1 + δj ) + (1 − µi )θ

(29)

τtj (θ) = p
and for i = 1, ..., I,
τij (θ) = p

Several comments about the optimal dynamic corrective taxes are in order. First, the
optimal tax in each period can generally be considered a weighted combination of exterality
correction and price salience internality correction, with weights depending on how forwardlooking the agent is through (R and δ). This can be seen most clearly during the first period
(or if otherwise either µi = 1 or θ = 1) when the taxes are
τ1F (θ) = p(R − 1) + φR > φ
τ1P (θ) = φ
−δ1
1
+ φ 1+δ
< φ.
τ1S (θ) = p 1+δ

Even when prices are salient in the first period, the fully naive tax is larger than marginal
external damage because of the internality of passive habit persistence; the partially naive
agent does not experience this internality, so their tax is equal to marginal external damage
when prices are salient; and the sophisticated agents try to avoid future internalities from
inattention by reducing consumption when prices are salient, so τ1S (θ) (and τiS (θ) for period
i soon enough after period 1) is less than the marginal social damage and can even be a
subsidy.
Second, the importance of the inattention parameter θ varies across time and agent type.
For fully and partially naive agents, the taxes in the initial fully salient period do not depend
on θ; at t = 1 naive agents do not plan to be inattentive. Therefore, they do not demand
commitment, and the optimal tax cannot influence their demand for such commitment. A
consequence of this for fully naive agents is that if there is no habit persistence and R = 1,
then the first period tax is equal to the marginal externality, τ1F (θ) = φ. If there are habits
then R > 1 and the first period tax additionally corrects the internality of failing to rationally
plan for habits (p(R − 1)) as well as the additional externalities caused by the internality
(φR).
A smaller θ implies a larger tax for all agent types during later periods in which agents are
not fully attentive to the true price. This occurs because the perceived price becomes farther
15

from the true price. During earlier periods when the true price is more likely to be salient,
however, the relationship between θ and the optimal tax depends on how forward-looking
the agent is. A smaller θ requires an unambiguously larger tax for fully and partially naive
agents during these earlier periods, but for sophisticated agents a smaller θ also increases δ,
which captures the anticipated effect of today’s consumption on all future demand functions.
Sophisticated agents anticipate greater overconsumption the smaller is θ, further reducing
consumption in earlier periods, which requires a smaller tax during the earlier periods when
perfect price attention is more likely.
Third, the optimal tax for all agent types increases over the salient window and the
relative ranking across agent types is preserved throughout the billing cycle. The optimal
tax increases because the probability of perceiving the true price declines, with the largest
tax occuring in the insalient window. The relative ranking is preserved at every time step
because the overconsumption from internalities is always the greatest for fully naive agents,
and always at least as great for partially naive than sophisticated agents; partially naive
agents only overconsume during inattentive periods, but never anticipate this overconsumption. Further, the internalities exacerbate the externality because they lead to excessive
consumption of a dirty good. The optimal corrective tax on the sophisticated agent is therefore never larger than the tax for the partially naive agent, and the tax for the fully naive
agent is strictly greater in each period than the tax for the other two agents:
τtF (θ) > τtP (θ) = τtS (θ) > φ,

t = I + 1, ..., T,

τiF (θ) >

τiP (θ)

> τiS (θ),

τ1F (θ) >

τ1P = φ

> τ1S (θ)

i = 2, ..., I,

(30)
Fourth, the relationship between habit persistence (α) and the optimal tax differs across
agent types and across time within the billing cycle. For the fully naive agent, if there is
no habit persistence then α = 0 and R = 1, so that the fully naive agent’s tax τtF (θ) does
not need to address the internality from being passive about consumption persistence. If
instead α > 0 (and R > 1), the optimal tax for the fully naive agent τtF (θ) must correct
both inattention to prices and myopia about consumption persistence in order to induce the
optimal path.
For the partially naive agents, habit persistence is not passive so the tax only needs to
correct the inattention internality and the pollution externality. We can see this because R -

16

the cumulative impact of persistence - is not present in the partially naive tax in any period;
the partially naive agent has already optimized over habit persistence and no tax correction
is required. The regulator can therefore put the partially naive agent on the optimal path
when the salient price signal is received (t = 1) by just correcting the externality, then keep
her on the optimal path by adjusting the tax for inattention in later periods.
Sophisticated agents anticipate the cumulative effect of inattention on habit persistence
through the δ parameter. A larger α implies a larger δ, which causes the sophisticated agent
to reduce consumption during attentive periods i = 1, ..., I, and causes the optimal tax in
those periods to decline.
We summarize the relationships of the behavioral parameters (the persistence parameter
α and the inattention parameter θ) and the optimal taxes across different time periods and
agent types in the following proposition:
Proposition 2. For the fully naive household:
• the stronger is habit persistence, the larger the tax in all periods:
∂τtF
> 0, t = 1, ..., T.
∂α
• the greater the inattention (the smaller is θ), the larger the tax in all periods in which
inattention is possible. The tax during the initial period when prices are perfectly salient
is unaffected by future insalience:
∂τtF
∂τ1F
= 0,
< 0 for t = 2, ..., T.
∂θ

For the partially naive household:
• the tax in all periods is independent of the strength of habit persistence:

inattention is possible, but the tax during the perfectly salient period (period 1) is unaffected:
∂τ1P

∂θ

For the sophisticated household:

17

• the stronger is habit persistence (as α affects δ), the smaller the tax during periods in
which attention to true prices is possible (i.e., t = 1, ..., I), while the tax in all future
periods is unaffected:
∂τtS
∂τiS
< 0 for i = 1, ..., I,

∂α
∂α
• the greater the inattention (the smaller is θ), the larger the tax in t > I, and the

∂τtS

2.3.1. Graphical Example
An example of taxes for the sophisticated agent are displayed in Figure 1. The lines
labeled Ux are the privately optimal demand functions if no salience effects exist. Because
prices are insalient in period t > I, the demand curve rotates up to x(p, τ, θ) - more is
consumed at every price, and demand is less responsive to prices. In anticipation of this the
sophisticated agent consumes less in period 1. This is captured by the downward rotation to
demand curve x1 (p, τ, θ, x0 ) in period 1. This reduction in consumption also reduces the habit
stock inherited in period t, which shifts the period t demand curve inward to xt (p, τ, θ, x1 ).
These final demands in red are used by the agent in choosing the consumption bundle. The
optimal taxes defined in Proposition 1 lead the agent to consume where there true marginal
benefits given by Ux intersect the social marginal cost (M C + EM C).

2.4. Time-invariant Tax Alternatives
For a variety of pragmatic reasons, including administrative costs and political opposition,
it may not be feasible to implement a time-varying tax. In this section, we explore some timeinvariant tax strategies and examine the implications of those strategies for social welfare
for a variety of agent types.
The most obvious candidate for a time-invariant tax is the standard Pigouvian rate of
marginal external damage, φ. If regulators recognize that price salience is a problem, they
may also apply the received wisdom from static models of tax salience (e.g., Chetty et al.,
2009; Chetty, 2009). Such a tax would fail to optimally account for time-varying salience and
the intertemporal nature of internalities. In this subsection we derive the optimal tax for the
static model (which is suboptimal in a dynamic setting), and then we derive a second-best
tax in the dynamic model that maximizes social welfare subject to the constraint that the
tax is time-invariant. This second-best constant tax is a weighted average of the optimal
dynamic tax in each period with weights that depend on the behavioral parameters and the
internalities associated with each agent type. Subsequently, in the following subsection, we
show how to quantify the welfare losses for any constant tax relative to the dynamic tax
optimum.

19

2.4.1. The (Sub)optimal Static Tax
If the regulator ignores the dynamic nature of the agent’s utility function, they will want
to implement a consumption path that equates the marginal utility in each time period to
the sum of the price and marginal external cost:
u0t = p + φ
The regulator will further expect agents to equate their marginal utility in each period to
the perceived price:
u0t = θp
The static tax chosen by a regulator would therefore equate
p + φ = θ(p + τstat )
The tax that solves this equation is
τstat = p

1−θ φ
+ .
θ
θ

(31)

This is equal to the optimal tax imposed on partially naive and sophisticated agents during
the insalient window. Intuitively, partially naive and sophisticated agents privately optimize
over their consumption persistence, so a static tax can be optimal for them during periods in
which their inattention is stable. The inefficiency of the static tax arises if there are dynamic
internalities (e.g., with fully naive agents) or if inattention is changing over time.
2.4.2. The Second-best Constant Tax
Let Ŵ (x̂j , ŷj ) = Ŵj (x0 , p; θ) be the social welfare function from (20) evaluated at the
privately optimal consumption paths for j ∈ {F, P, S}. Suppose a small tax τ is added to
a previously untaxed environment so that we evaluate Ŵj (x0 , p + τ ; θ). The second-best
Ŵ
optimal constant tax solves ∂∂τ
= 0 for each type of agent. As we show below, in each case
the second-best tax is an exact-weighted average of the optimal dynamic taxes where the
weights depend on the household type and within-period demand curve slope. The slopes of
the demand curves will be constant functions of θ, α, the price p, the habit stock at time t,
and utility parameters, so for convenience define
∂ x̂tj
= atj , j ∈ {F, P, S}.
∂τ
20

Also for notational convenience we will denote the optimal dynamic tax τtj as τI+1,j for
any period t = I + 1, ..., T because the optimal dynamic tax is constant during the insalient
window after the I 0 th period in each cycle, when inattention is stable.
Proposition 3. To conserve notation, let δj = 0 for fully and partially naive agents and
δj = δ for sophisticated agents. The second-best constant tax rate for j ∈ {F, P, S}, is given
by the weighted average

The weights in τj? are the discounted demand curve slopes, adjusted by the salience
applied to each period’s decision. The second-best tax therefore differs between agent types

22

for two reasons. First, the weights differ between agent types; the demand curves have
different slopes because the partially naive agent plans for habits while the fully naive agent
does not, and the sophisticated agent plans for both habits and inattention. These different
dynamic behaviors create different price-responsiveness within given period. Second, the
optimal dynamic taxes that are being weighted also differ by agent type.
The size of the second best constant tax for sophisticated agents is more influenced by
the behavioral parameters of the habit process than the second best taxes for the naive agent
types because of the sophisticated agent’s demand for commitment. If consumption is more
persistent (if α is large), then sophisticated agents have a more effective commitment device.
This makes future demand more responsive to current consumption (i.e., the ∂∂xx̂ti are large,
making δ large), and the agent makes larger corrections in early periods on her own. In this
case, the constant tax must be weighted more towards correcting under-consumption in early
periods. With a large δ, τ1S and τiS become more heavily weighted and also become smaller,
so the constant tax τS? also becomes smaller. This does not necessarily mean that stronger
habit persistence is better for welfare. Intuitively, with stronger habit persistence there is
more adjustment in consumption across price salient and insalient time periods. Part of the
consumption- and pollution-reducing functions of the second-best constant tax are weakened
in order to prevent the sophisticated agent from consuming too little when prices are salient.
A large δ will also occur if the discount factor is close to one (so that the agent adjusts
its habits out of concern for the future and needs less of a tax incentive). Likewise if δ is
small the emphasis in the constant tax can be shifted back towards reducing pollution and
overconsumption in later periods, and the tax is larger.
2.5. Efficiency Cost
We now turn to deriving the welfare loss of a time-invarient tax. The formulas we derive
are valid for calculating the efficiency cost of any time-invariant tax, however we will focus
primarily on the second-best constant tax τj? . Although τj? is chosen in each case to minimize
the deadweight loss from over- and under-consumption by definition, the remaining losses
have policy relevance. The size of the deadweight loss (and of τj? ) depends on behavioral
parameters α and θ, as well as the level of sophistication of the agent. To the extent
that alternative policy tools (such as information technology investments or goal-setting
programs) can affect these parameters, they can influence the size of the deadweight loss.
For example, smart electricity grid technologies that provide real-time price information to
households require large fixed costs, but the new information that households receive may
alter their inattention and habit formation behavior. Therefore an estimable expression for
23

this loss and how it depends on these parameters is important for these investment decisions.
We will use the concept of equivalent variation to derive an expression for the excess
burden on consumers when the regulator imposes a tax that cannot correct all internalities
and externalities. The loss will be calculated as the net present value of the wealth society
would be willing to forgoe in order to avoid the imperfect tax instrument (relative to the
optimum), net of any changes in tax revenue between the two policies. Because the reference (optimal) tax level varies, we will represent society’s expenditure function and indirect
welfare function as depending on a tax-inclusive price vector (even though the tax-inclusive
price will be constant for a the second-best constant tax). Temporarily suppressing the F ,
P , and S subscripts, the general expression for the excess burden of deviating from the
I + 1-vector of optimal taxes τ (θ) to τ ? is

τ ? applied in the analogous time periods, with τ(I+1)
could use the same procedure to calculate the excess burden of any I +1-vector of sub-optimal
taxes, include the other time-invariant tax options discussed in the previous subsection. The
function e (·) is society’s expenditure function. It is the amount of wealth at the optimal tax
vector that would achieve the level of welfare obtained under the second-best constant tax.
The difference between e (·) and the net present value of income is the amount of wealth
society would be willing to forgoe to retain the optimal tax structure. The last term in
parentheses measures any gain or loss in tax revenue from moving from the optimal dynamic
taxes to the alternative set of taxes. For example,

Again, we can use this expression to calculate the efficiency cost of any suboptimal tax
vector by substituting that tax vector in for τ ? . The envelope theorem guarantees that the
first-order terms in the Taylor expansion will be zero when evaluated at the optimal tax
vector. The second order terms require taking derivatives of marginal utilities in each period
with respect to tax changes in the same and all other periods, evaluated at the demands
associated with the optimal dynamic tax vector.
Let Pt (xt−1 , xt , xt+1 ) = u0t (xt − αxt−1 ) − αβu0t+1 (xt+1 − αxt ) represent the agent’s true
intertemporal preferences for xt , i.e., the welfare-relevant inverse demand at time t. This
is the inverse demand curve at time t along the optimal path if the agent was a perfectly
attentive and sophisticated agent. The decision-relevant demands will deviate from this
welfare-relevant demand because of inattention and, in the case of the fully naive agent, the
failure to optimize over habits.
For an optimizing agent, past and anticipated future quantities demanded shift current
demand. Partially naive and sophisticated agents adjust current demand in response to
anticipated future tax changes because they expect the persistence of current consumption
to affect their future tax burden. During the salient window of each cycle, the sophisticated
agent also anticipates being inattentive to the future tax-inclusive price; in order to avoid
paying additional future taxes due to inattention, the agent further reduces consumption
today. A future tax increase therefore results in an inward rotation in the early period
demand curves for sophisticated agents. That inward rotation causes reduced consumption
to persist through lower habit in future periods, causing future period demand curves to shift
inward. Fully naive agents, on the other hand, do not anticipate future habits, so future
tax changes do not affect current period demand. Current period tax increases do influence
current period demand, however, which has a spillover effect on future consumption through
passive habit persistence. For fully naive agents, therefore, all past tax changes - but no
future tax changes - affect demand in a given period.
Consider the effect of a tax change applied in period i ≤ I on demand in some arbitrary
period t, and suppose the tax change is applied in the i0 th period of each cycle. This effect
will include a direct effect if i = t, as well as indirect effects that persist from changes in
demand in the i0 th period of previous cycles, and indirect effects from anticipated demand

The I + 1’th element of the tax vector is applied in each period during the insalient

each other period in the current and all other cycles. If the period t of interest is within the

Expanding equation (40) and plugging in the second- and cross-partial derivatives produces equation (39).
The second order terms that govern the Taylor series approximation to EB(τ ? ) are simply
the net present value of a sequence of deadweight loss triangles. The base and height of the
deadweight loss triangle in each period needs to adjust for the (potential) rotations and shifts
that occur because of the response to tax changes in different periods. If there were no habits
or inattention then no such shifts or rotations would occur; in this case the deadweight loss
(dropping the cycle subscript M for convenience) in each period would be given by the

terms in equation (39). Furthermore, during the insalient window, these deadweight loss

would be − 12 (µt (1 + δ) + (1 − µt )θ) ∆τjt ∂τjtjt ∆τjt . The remainder of the terms in equation
(39) capture the additional shifts and rotations from the indirect effects of taxes applied in
other periods that further distort the size of the deadweight loss triangles in each period.
The deadweight loss for sophisticated agents is illustrated in Figure 2 (for the first period
and a later period during the insalient window).

As drawn, the deadweight loss in period 1 is larger than in period t > I, but the period
t > I losses are experienced during each period in the insalient window in a given cycle. The
total excess burden in (40) is increasing in the habit parameter α, holding taxes constant.
When the taxes during the insalient window are lowered from their optimal dynamic values
to meet the second-best constant rate, overconsumption in the insalient window becomes a
problem and the sophisticated agent makes larger adjustments during the salient window,
rotating the period 1 demand curve further downward. Agents with larger α will make
larger period 1 adjustments. The more the demand curve rotates downward, the greater the
underconsumption problem in period 1, and the greater the period 1 deadweight loss, which
increases total losses.
Equation (39) is useful for quantifying the social losses more generally if some tax vector
τe is implemented that differs from τ j (θ). For example, we can evaluate the excess burden
from any of the time-invariant taxes discussed in subsection 2.4. If the regulator uses the
conventional wisdom of taxing at marginal external damage φ(s) in each period s then the
excess burden is simply

The losses from implementing alternative taxes can be calculated in a similar manner.
For example, if the regulator uses the tax that would be optimal in a static model of salience
we could substitute τstat,(s) in for φ(s) in equation (41).9
3. Numerical Simulation
One useful feature of our proposed corrective tax structure is that all the parameters in
the expressions are estimable or recoverable from recent studies in the literature. For the
residential electricity consumption example, there is a large literature on demand elasticity,
as well as recent estimates of habit persistence and price salience. Marginal social damages
of various pollutants from the electricity sector are available from, among others, Graff Zivin,
Kotchen, and Mansur (2012). In this section we perform a numerical simulation in order to
demonstrate the magnitude of the optimal dynamic and second best corrective taxes, and
the excess burden of failing to implement optimal dynamic taxes.
In order to calculate numerical values for the taxes and the excess burden we need to
derive specific functional forms for the derivatives of the demand functions for each agent,
and for the slope of the welfare-relevant demand. The complete expressions for these total
and partial derivatives, and for the excess burden, are derived in the appendix. Here we
briefly outline the characteristics of the demand curves that are used in these expressions
9

This also applies if the regulator is incorrect about agent type. Suppose households are type j but the
regulator believes they are type j 0 and implements τ ?j0 . We can calculate the excess burden by plugging in
the demand curve slopes for type j households applied to differences between the type j 0 second best taxes
(τ ?j0 ) and the type j optimal taxes (τ j (θ)) as in:

utility is quadratic. Let utility in period s be given by

= a(xs − αxs−1 ) − b(xs − αxs−1 )2 + ys .

Beginning from some arbitrary period t, we derive the welfare-relevant inverse demands,

with xt−1 given and prices fully salient across time. The first order conditions give

= a(1 − βα) − b(1 + βα2 )xt + bαxt−1 + bβαxt+1 ,
We also need to derive expressions for
total derivatives require expressions for

for each agent type j and period s. These

the slope of the type j demand curve in each period t, and

the shift in the type j demand curve in period t because of a change in consumption
in period r that persists from the past or is anticipated in the future.

In the appendix, we derive these expressions using the demand curves for each agent type.
The fully naive agent is not forward-looking about consumption persistence and ignores the
intertemporal effect on habits. Rearranging the first order condition for the fully naive agent
gives the following linear representation of demand in period t:
a µt + (1 − µt )θ
−
p + αxt−1 .
(44)

Equation (44) gives the familiar result that consumption is less responsive to prices when
they are not fully salient. If prices are constant, then insalient prices, i.e. periods when θ is

less than one, imply an upward shift in the intercept of the consumption function during the
insalient window, which was the finding in Gilbert and Graff Zivin (2014)10 . Ignoring the
salience factor, this specification is equivalent to the case in Becker, Grossman, and Murphy
(1994) in which habit formation is not forward-looking. If there is no consumption persistence
(α = 0) then current consumption also does not depend directly on past consumption.
Rearranging the first order condition for the problem for partially naive and sophisticated
agents, who are forward-looking about consumption persistence, provides the following linear
demand:

(45)

where δj = 0 for partially naive agents and δj = δ for sophisticated agents.
In a model without consumption persistence or inattention, the response to a price change
in the current period is −1/b. This is dampened by 1/(1 + βα2 ) as agents anticipate the
persistence of today’s consumption change into the future. In the case of partially naive
agents, the response to current prices is also dampened by the expected salience µt +(1−µt )θ.
In the case of sophisticated agents, the response to current prices is augmented by 1 + δ as
the household tries to commit to reduced consumption.
3.1. Numerical Calibration
We first provide parameters for a central case of the model for U.S. electricity consumption, and then perform sensitivity analysis for key parameters. The parameters for the
central case are given in Table 1.
The habit parameter can be calculated from empirical studies on habit formation in
energy consumption. Filippini et al. (2016) estimate a coefficient on lagged electricity
α
consumption of 0.422. Using the derivations above, we solve 0.422 = 1+βα
2 for α, using the
root that falls between zero and one11 . The daily discount factor β was chosen to produce
an annual discount factor of 0.9.
10

We assume a constant price in order to isolate the effect of price salience rather than price uncertainty.
This is also consistent with our empirical context because electricity prices are usually fixed, regulated rates.
11
Using Scott’s (2012) coefficient of 0.787 on lagged gasoline consumption and solving for the real part of
the complex roots produces α = 0.64, while using Heien & Durham’s (1991) coefficient of 0.418 on lagged
electricity produces α = 0.54. Macroeconomic studies using aggregate data (e.g., Fuhrer (2000)) typically
estimate the habit parameter closer to 0.8.

32

The salience parameter is calculated using Sexton’s (2015) estimate that households that
pay their electricity bill using automatic withdrawal consume 4% more energy than houses
that receive a bill and take an action to make a payment. We take the automatic withdrawal
households as inattentive to price, and the active payment households as attentive to price.
Using a demand elasticity of -0.1, the implied relative slope of the inattentive and attentive
demand curves is 0.71. The astute reader will note that this estimate is larger than those
found in the tax salience literature (e.g., Chetty et al. (2009) and Taubinsky & Rees-Jones
(2017)), but those studies assume that only the tax portion of the tax-inclusive price is
insalient. We will evaluate sensitivity of our results to this parameter below.
The marginal damage parameter is calculated by combining an estimate of the national
average marginal CO2 /kwh emissions with an estimate of the marginal social cost of CO2 .
Graff Zivin et al. (2014) estimate a national average marginal emissions rate of 1.21 lbs
of CO2 /kwh. Inflated to 2017 dollars, the U.S. EPA’s most recent central estimate of the
social cost of carbon is $49.66 per ton of CO2 which we converted to pounds to arrive at an
estimate of $0.03/kwh, or about one fourth of the 2017 national average electricity price of
$0.129/kwh (EIA, 2017).12
We use the price elasticity of electricity demand, along with the national average daily
household consumption and electricity price, in order to calculate an average linear demand
slope. We assume that electricity prices are not salient for the majority of each billing
month (Gilbert & Graff Zivin (2014)), and so we take our calculated slopes to represent
the slope during insalient periods, despite the fact that they “average in” brief periods of
salience following payment of a bill. Estimates of the elasticity of electricity demand vary in
the literature. We do not wish to provide a full review of the electricity demand elasticity
literature here, but as a few recent examples, Alberini & Filippini (2011) estimate short
run elasticities between -0.8 and -0.15, Filippini et al. (2016) between -0.12 and -0.27, and
Deryugina et al. (2017) of about -0.16. We take the low end of this range and use -0.1
because we have very short run (daily) behavior in mind for our model.
Lastly, we assume a cycle length of T = 30 to reflect monthly billing, and a salient
window of I = 10 which is roughly consistent with the findings in Gilbert and Graff Zivin
(2014). The magnitudes of our results are stable over variation in the length of the salient
window within a cycle.
12

EPA (2013) reported the social cost of carbon as $42 in the year 2020 (valued in 2007 dollars) at a 3%
social discount rate. We converted this to 2017 dollars using the CPI.

3.2. Results
The time path of optimal dynamic taxes (τj (θ)) for each agent type is shown in Figure
3, with second-best constant taxes (τj? ) marked on the vertical axis. The taxes are shown
in dollars per unit of electricity, or kilowatthour. For reference, the U.S. average electricity
price is $0.129 per kilowatthour. As stated in Proposition 1, the taxes are rising throughout
the salient window as the probability of full price attention declines. At any time period, the
tax is significantly larger for the fully naive agent than either of the other agent types or the
marginal externality of $0.03 per kilowatthour. The tax for the partially naive agent begins
at the marginal externality in the first, fully salient period, and is always at least as large
as the tax for the sophisticated agent. The tax for the sophisticated agent begins below the
marginal externality and rises to exceed it by the end of the salient window.

Notes: The dotted line is the optimal dynamic tax for the Fully Naive agent, the solid black line is the optimal dynamic tax for
the Partially Naive agent, and the dashed line is the optimal dynamic tax for the Sophisticated agent. Bold hash marks on the
vertical axis denote second-best constant taxes in each case, as well as the marginal social damage, φ = 0.03. Tax units are in
dollars; for example, φ is three cents per kilowatthour of electricity which is about one fourth of the national average electricity
price of 12.9 cents per kilowatthour.

The main results for excess burden are shown in Table 2, including the numerical values
of the taxes shown in Figure 3. The excess burden of a time invariant tax is reported for
the second-best constant tax, the static salience tax ignoring dynamic inefficiencies (τstat =
0.095), and the standard Pigouvian rate of φ = 0.03. Excess burden is reported in present
value dollars. The excess burden of the second-best constant tax is largest for the fully naive
agent at $114.5 per household and smallest for the partially naive household at $18.93 per

35

household. With approximately 122 million households in the U.S., this puts the welfare
loss associated with moving from the optimal dynamic tax to the optimal, but second-best,
constant tax at between $2.4 billion and $14.4 billion for the residential electricity sector.
If agents are sophisticated, this figure is $49.91 per household or $6.3 billion for the U.S.
residential electricity sector.
Notice, however, that the excess burden increases significantly as the time-invariant tax
moves away from it’s second-best optimal level. When taxing at the static optimal rate of
$0.095, which ignores dynamic inefficiencies, the excess burden is $2,364, $30.28 or $90.61
per household if agents are fully naive, partially naive, or sophisticated, respectively. Whe
taxing at the Pigouvian rate of $0.03, which ignores internalities, the excess burden is $3,790,
$84.84, or $83.90 per household if agents are fully naive, partially naive, or sophisticated,
respectively. Table 2 also reports excess burden figures for implementing no taxes at all,
which are not surprisingly larger than any of the tax scenarios discussed.

Notes: This table reports the optimal dynamic taxes, second-best constant
taxes, and excess burden of several time-invariant taxes using parameters
from Table 1. The taxes are reported in dollars per unit of electricity (kilowatthour) while the excess burden values are reported in present value dollars.
The marginal externality is φ = $0.03 per unit of electricity (kilowatthour)
and the optimal tax for a static model is τstat = $0.095 per kilowatthour.
For comparison, the U.S. average residential electricity price is $0.129 per
kilowatthour.

Figure 4 illustrates the findings of Proposition 2, on the sensitivity of optimal dynamic
taxes to persistence (α) and salience (θ). For the fully naive agent, stronger habit persistence
requires a larger tax in all periods because the household fails to take consumption persistence
into account. The partially naive agent, on the other hand, privately optimizes its habit stock
in each period, so the tax only needs to correct for the salience internality and the externality;
as a result the habit parameter has no effect on the size of the tax. The sophisticated
agent also privately optimizes its habit stock, except that during attentive periods the agent
is imperfectly committing to a new consumption path through habit persistence and the
regulator must optimally address that commitment demand. If commitment (i.e., habit) is
stronger, the regulator can reduce the tax during potentially attentive periods.
For all three agent types, the tax can be lower during inattentive periods if inattention is
less severe (i.e., if θ is closer to one). During attentive periods the relationship between θ and
the optimal tax differs across agent types. The fully naive and partially naive agents do not
anticipate inattention in the future, so θ only affects the tax during periods in which there
is a chance the agent will be inattentive. The sophisticated agent underconsumes in early
periods because of (imperfect) commitment to reduce future overconsumption. Because of
early underconsumption, the tax starts below marginal damage in the first, perfectly salient
period and rises to exceed marginal damage as the probability of being inattentive rises. The
tax in early periods can therefore be larger (closer to marginal damage) if future inattention
is less severe, as this alleviates underconsumption during the early periods.

Notes: The solid black line on each graph is the optimal dynamic tax in the base case, with α = 0.55 and θ = 0.71. Bold hash marks on the vertical axes denote
second-best constant taxes in each case, as well as the marginal social damage, φ = 0.03. Tax units are in dollars; for example, φ is three cents per kilowatthour of
electricity which is about one fourth of the national average electricity price of 12.9 cents per kilowatthour. Note the different scale of the vertical axis for the Fully
Naive case. For Fully Naive agents, optimal taxes are larger in all periods with greater consumption persistence, α, and with lower salience, θ (other than the first
period). For Partially Naive agents, optimal taxes are invariant to α but are larger with lower θ. For Sophisticated agents, optimal taxes are lower during the insalient
window when α is larger, whereas a lower θ’s causes the time path of optimal taxes to rotate down in the earliest periods and up in later periods.

Figure 5 illustrates the sensitivity of excess burden to changes in the habit persistence
and salience parameters. Darker shading corresponds to larger excess burden. The scale
of the subfigures differs for each agent type because the excess burden increases so rapidly
as the salience parameter declines, but at different rates for each agent type; it is difficult
to represent sensitivity to θ on the same scale. For fully naive agents, the excess burden
of the second-best tax increases rapidly both as salience declines and persistence increases.
This occurs because myopia about habit persistence creates a large internality for the fully
naive agent and as the persistence parameter increases, this internality grows. For partially
naive and sophisticated agents, the major source of variation in excess burden is the salience
parameter, because this is the main source of the internality. However, there is a slight
decline in excess burden for the partially naive agent as persistence increases. In Figures 6
and 7 of Appendix B, we report similar results for the excess burden of the static salience
tax and the Pigouvian tax.
Lastly, Table 3 reports the sensitivity of excess burden to the elasticity of demand.
Specifically, the table shows that the excess burden for each of the time-invariant taxes
and each of the agent types grows linearly as demand becomes more elastic. The welfare
losses for a good that has unit elastic demand are ten times larger than the welfare losses
in our residential electricity example assuming a demand elasticity of -0.1. Considering the
variety of types of goods to which our model applies (e.g., gasoline, unhealthy food, etc.),
the economy-wide losses from imperfect taxation and time-varying salience are likely to be
non-trivial.

Notes: Excess burden is quantified in per household present value dollars, with darker shading indicating larger excess burden. Note that the scale is different for each
agent type. This is necessary because the variation in excess burden across the parameter space and agent types is highly nonlinear. For Fully Naive agents, both
lower salience and higher persistence have an economically meaningful effect on the excess burden of a constant tax. For Partially Naive and Sophisticated agents, who
dynamically optimize over persistence, salience is the main factor in the size of the excess burden of a constant tax. However, excess burden does vary slightly with
persistence; excess burden is larger for when persistence is lower for Partially Naive agents, whereas excess burden is concave in persistence for Sophisticated agents.

Notes: This table reports the excess burden of time invariant taxes as a function of the elasticity of demand, . Three time-invariant taxes are evaluated
for each agent type: the second best constant tax (τj? ), the Pigouvian tax which ignores internalities (φ), and the static salience tax (τstat ). In each case,
excess burden scales linearly with the elasticity of demand.

4. Conclusion
Economies across the globe are becoming increasingly cashless and many payments systems have become automated, driving a temporal wedge between consumption and payment
and generally making the costs of consumption intermittently salient. Since this inconsistent
price salience alters demand elasticities, it is a particular concern for goods that generate
externalities and the price-based policies deployed to address them. This paper develops a
simple model of consumer behavior when prices of a good that creates some social harm
are intermittently salient. Dynamics are driven by the persistence of consumption decisions
across time, an empirical feature of intertemporal consumption for which there is a large volume of evidence across contexts such as habit formation, durable goods adoption, and status
quo bias, to name a few. In this setting the forward-looking capacity of the agents shapes
the nature of dynamic externalities and internalities, and is therefore crucial for optimal
taxation and welfare analysis.
We derive an optimal dynamic tax schedule for three types of agents: a fully naive agent
who does not anticipate future inattention or plan for consumption persistence; a partially
naive agent who also does not anticipate future inattention but is forward looking about
persistence; and a sophisticated agent who anticipates future inattention and plans for consumption persistence. In the fully naive case, optimal taxes are highly sensitive to the degree
of salience and persistence, with lower salience and higher persistence requiring considerably
larger taxes to generate the optimal consumption path. In the partially naive case, the degree of persistence is irrelevant to the optimal tax schedule because there is no internality
from persistence and also no demand for commitment. Lower salience still results in larger
optimal taxes, however. In the sophisticated case, the agent demands commitment to avoid
future suboptimal decisions when prices are salient, and consumption persistence provides a
vehicle to at least partially achieve that commitment. Greater persistence therefore lowers
the taxes required to put the agent on the optimal consumption path, while lower salience
results in greater variation in the tax schedule: lower taxes when agents are paying attention
to prices, and higher optimal taxes when they are not.
Since time-varying taxes can be bureaucratically expensive and politically difficult to
implement, we also explore the consumption and welfare implications under a variety of timeinvariant tax strategies. In particular, we derive a second-best constant tax that maximizes
welfare among time-invariant taxes. We also consider the welfare consequences of ignoring
internalities and taxing at the Pigouvian rate of marginal external cost, as well as the welfare
consequences of ignoring dynamics and imposing a tax that would be optimal in a static
44

model with inattention and externalities.
The key insights from our model are then placed into context through a simulation
exercise based on data from the U.S. residential electricity market. This market is attractive
for a number of reasons, not least of which because there is well-documented persistence in
consumption over time within households, price inattention, intermittent billing, and socially
costly environmental externalities. Our base case results suggest that optimal taxes are
significantly larger than those corresponding to the simple Pigouvian case. The magnitude
of this difference is driven by the size of the internalities associated with inattention and
persistence and vary by agent type. The optimal tax is roughly ten times larger than the
Pigouvian one for fully naive agents, but only twice as large for sophisticated agents. We also
find that the welfare losses from time-invariant taxes are more than an order of magnitude
larger if agents are fully naive than if agents are partially naive or sophisticated. Even the
optimal time-invariant tax generates welfare losses that range from 2.4 to 14.5 billion dollars
when aggregated across the US electricity market.
The sensitivity of these results to alternative parameter assumptions is also explored.
Since the excess burden from second-best tax strategies scales with the elasticity of demand,
the welfare losses in this context will very much depend on the nature of demand for the
good in question. Goods with a unit elasticity of demand, for example, would incur welfare
losses ten times that of our electricity example. The degree of price salience also plays a
significant role in determining the welfare losses from second best time-invariant tax policies.
A modest thirty percent change in the salience parameter generates an excess burden that
is five to ten times larger than in our base case, underscoring the magnitude of heterogenous
impacts across different consumption contexts.
Our study has several limitations. Our model of inattention is intentionally stylized. We
do not allow price inattention to be determined by past decisions, the magnitude of relative
prices, or other environmental cues that may determine attention in a particular context.
While our conceptualization of consumption persistence is general, it abstracts from important aspects of persistence that could arise due to complementary durable good purchases.
Efforts to endogenize inattention and further formalize the persistence relationship constitute the next logical steps in advancing the insights from our model. On the empirical side,
our simulation is hampered by the lack of data and empirical tests that could be used to
distinguish between fully naive, partially naive, and sophisticated agents. Understanding
which agent types are most prevalent in a particular setting, or better yet how to target each
of them through careful mechanism design, is critical for the design of good policy and an

45

area ripe for future research.

demand curve:

Recall that the I + 10 th element of the dynamic tax vector is imposed in every period
during the insalient window, and that for fully naive agents the effect of a future tax increase
on current demand is zero. From equation (44), we obtain for tax changes during the salient

The slope of the demand curve in period r when the tax is levied governs the period r change
in xr , which persists forward to period t according to αt−r , αT +t−r , and so forth. Tax changes
that occur later than period t do not affect period t demand.

4.2. Partially Naive and Sophisticated Agents

(54)

where δj = 0 for partially naive agents and δj = δ for sophisticated agents.
For notational convenience, define the response to past consumption as
γ=

α
1 + βα2

and the absolute value of the slope of current period demand as
d0jt =|

∂xjt
(µt (1 + δj ) + (1 − µt )θ)
|=
.
∂τ
b(1 + βα2 )
48

(55)

Unlike the fully naive case, current consumption is increasing in expected future consumption as well as past consumption. If the agent is attentive to prices in period t - but not
sophisticated about inattention and salience - then they take into account how period t consumption affects period t+1 decisions, but not that period t+1 decisions will be suboptimal.
In the sophisticated case the household also considers expected impacts on future demand
through δ. Recall that

Notes: Excess burden is quantified in per household present value dollars, with darker shading indicating larger excess burden. Note that the scale is different for each
agent type. This is necessary because the variation in excess burden across the parameter space and agent types is highly nonlinear. For Fully Naive agents, both
lower salience and higher persistence have an economically meaningful effect on the excess burden of a constant tax. For Partially Naive and Sophisticated agents, who
dynamically optimize over persistence, salience is the main factor in the size of the excess burden of a constant tax. However, excess burden does vary slightly with
persistence for these agent types; the excess burden of taxing at the standard Pigouvian rate is larger for when persistence is lower.
