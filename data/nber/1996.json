Much attention has\nbeen paid to the econometric estimation of models of household responses to\ntaxes. But these models yield valid estimates of the welfare consequences\nof tax changes only when the implied preference orderings are well behaved.\nThis paper discusses the nature of such conditions in detail. Where there\nare rionlinearities in the budget constraint then two sets of \"primal\" and\n\"dual\" conditions must be satisfied. The analysis of these conditions\nyields suggestions for the specification of behavioural models and the use\nof individual-specific information in the observed data.\n\n",
