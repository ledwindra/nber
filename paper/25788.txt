Impacts of Industrial and Entrepreneurial Jobs on Youth: 5-year Experimental Evidence on
Factory Job Offers and Cash Grants in Ethiopia

ABSTRACT
We study two interventions for underemployed youth across five Ethiopian sites: a $300 grant to
spur self-employment, and a job offer to an industrial firm. Despite significant impacts on
occupational choice, income, and health in the first year, after five years we see nearly complete
convergence across all groups and outcomes. Shortrun increases in productivity and earnings
from the grant dissipate as recipients exit their micro-enterprises. Adverse effects of factory work
on health found after one year also appear to be temporary. These results suggest that one-time
and one-dimensional interventions may struggle to overcome barriers to wage- or selfemployment.

Introduction

In developing countries, such as Ethiopia, low-skilled youth often spend long periods of time
underemployed or not employed at all. Young women often face steeper challenges than men
and exhibit lower rates of labour force participation and higher rates of unemployment.
This paper follows a panel of young, mostly women, low-skilled job-seekers in Ethiopia
over a period of five years. Our aim is to assess whether young people in this context face
barriers to entry into occupations for which they would be well suited. We use two experiments to analyze whether one-time interventions can overcome impediments to entering two
of the most common types of work: (i) low-skill wage work, especially in factories; and (ii)
self-employment in petty business and other "microenterprises".
Between 2010 and 2013, we identified nearly 1000 people interested in an industrial job
at one of five firms. The firms were in different sectors and regions, each one hiring a large
batch of workers for a line expansion, sometimes multiple cohorts over time. Most of the
eligible applicants were healthy but unemployed women in their early 20s, with no formal
work experience and little self-employment. We introduced two experimental interventions:
a cash grant intended to stimulate self-employment, and a factory job offer intended to
reduce barriers to entry in wage employment. Thus, the job-seekers were assigned to either
a start-up grant, the job offer, or a control group. After a baseline survey, we re-interviewed
the sample after roughly 1 and 5 years, finding 85–90%.
The first intervention was a cash grant worth roughly $300, equal to about one year’s
income at prevailing wages. It was framed as a business start-up grant and came with a
few days of training and consulting on microenterprises.1 The grant was designed to help
these young people overcome one of the most commonly cited barriers to self-employment:
a lack of capital or access to credit.2 Unemployed youth in developing countries may have
opportunities in “entrepreneurial” self-employment, in agriculture or petty trades, but lack
the initial capital required to start such small businesses. They may also face uncertainty
about their own ability to run an enterprise and not be able to take the risk of experimenting
with this kind of work.
In these contexts, cash or in-kind grants could spur investment and increase long-run
earnings. A number of recent studies have found that cash or other capital injections reduce
poverty over horizons of mostly 1–4 years.3 These results have bolstered a view that a lack of

In northern Uganda, a program giving women $150 grants, basic training and follow-up led to large
income gains after 18 months (Blattman, Annan, Green, Lehmann, and Jamison (2016)). Grants of cash
and in-kind capital to less poor, existing entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka, Ghana and India led to sustained

capital and imperfect financial markets hold many poor people below their potential. There
is relatively little long term evidence, however, and we do not know the longevity of these
high returns to capital. Moreover, theory suggests that, unless people are hampered by
extreme constraints and frictions, over time they should be able to earn and save enough to
make the same microenterprise investments.
In the second experiment, we worked with the industrial firms to randomize offers to
entry-level jobs. We observed queues of young people, mostly women, applying for industrial
jobs around Ethiopia, most of whom were turned away because of insufficient new openings.4
Following months of qualitative observation and interviews around dozens of factories, we
hypothesized that these industrial jobs were widely desired but scarce. There were some
indications the firms offered unusually stable employment levels and paid wage premiums
compared to self-employment. Theoretically, there are several reasons why industrial work
would pay a wage premium compared to informal work. Firms may pay efficiency wages or
there may also be institutional and legislative sources, such as minimum wages, labor codes,
or union bargaining (Katz, Summers, Hall, Schultze, & Topel, 1989; Akerlof & Yellen, 1986;
Card, 1996). If so, the result is a dual or segmented labor market, in which those gaining
industrial jobs earn rents while informal workers queue for those jobs (Lewis, 1954; Harris &
Todaro, 1970; Fields, 1975).5 Even in the absence of wage premiums, industrial jobs could
also set young workers on a job ladder that leads to scarce skills, better jobs, and higher
wages over time, especially young women.6 But workers may exhibit considerable heteroincreases in earnings 1–5 years later (Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff (2012), Fafchamps, McKenzie, Quinn,
and Woodruff (2014), Hussam, Rigol, and Roth (2017)). Cash grants to poor farmers in Mali raised farm
inputs and incomes after 1 and 2 years (Beaman, Karlan, Thuysbaert, and Udry (2014)). Unconditional
cash transfers in Kenyan villages led to sustained increases in assets between treatment and control villages,
but no consumption impacts after 9 months and 3 years (Haushofer and Shapiro (2016, 2018)). There is also
some evidence from a Mexican national program that cash relieves important financial constraints and leads
to higher income after 1–2 years (Gertler, Martinez, and Rubio (2012), Bianchi and Bobba (2013)). Across
7 countries, programs that give grants of livestock with basic training and temporary income support show
sustained increases on the incomes and consumption of the poorest rural households four years after grants
(Banerjee, Karlan, and Zinman (2015), Bandiera et al. (2013, 2017)). The effects of capital injections are not
universally positive, however. Fiala (2018) fails to find income effects from cash grants to existing businesses
in Uganda. A cash grant programs to young men living on the streets of Monrovia and engaged in petty
crime also had very short-lived impacts (less than one year) on enterprise and earnings, potentially due to
the unusual instability and risk of their existence (Blattman, Jamison, and Sheridan (2017)). Karlan, Osei,
Osei-Akoto, and Udry (2014) find that cash grants to Ghanaian farmers had no effect without insurance,
also because of the constraints from imperfect insurance.
4
Ethiopia has been a growing export hub in horticulture, textiles, and leather. As countries like Ethiopia
enter the early stages of industrialization, the number of low-skill industrial job opportunities have grown.
5
Empirically, a large body of observational evidence suggests that formal firms pay premium wages,
especially large, foreign-owned, or exporting firms (Bernard, Robertson, & Schott, 2010; Verhoogen, 2008;
Söderbom & Teal, 2004; El Badaoui, Strobl, & Walsh, 2008).
6
Women are commonly employed in low-skill firms, and there is observational evidence that working in
textile factories or other export manufacturers raises women’s status in the household, their quality of life,

2

geneity in their suitability for factory work. And a growing body of literature suggests that
hiring among firms in developing countries is prone to considerable frictions and information assymetries, which may prevent firms from selecting the workers who are most likely to
flourish in careers in these occupations (Abebe et al., 2018; Bassi & Nansamba, 2017; Abel,
Burger, & Piraino, 2017).
Even absent any scarcity or rents in industrial jobs, a randomized job offer might change
occupational choice and earnings paths in the long run. Most of our sample was unemployed
for at least a month before they entered our sample, either due to adverse shocks or because
they are entering the labor market for the first time or after a spell of unemployment. A
range of research in more developed labor markets suggests that market conditions and
opportunities for such people matter a great deal for long term labor market prospects
(Arulampalam, Gregg, & Gregory, 2001; Kroft, Lange, & Notowidigdo, 2013). Young people
and women in particular in Ethiopia may also face uncertainty about their own proclivities
and abilities for industrial work, be unaware of health and other risks, or face other search
and matching frictions. Because so many low-skilled people apply to the still small number
of industrial firms, even well-matched individuals may never get the opportunity to enter
into these occupations.
For the most part, we do not find support for the hypotheses that start-up grants lead
to sustained income changes, or that industrial job offers affect long-run well-being. Over
five years, we see that these young and mostly unemployed women found relatively full-time
employment in a variety of wage work and microenterprises, even without the opportunity
for a grant or an initial job offer. Medium-run equilibrium labor market outcomes seem unaffected by the interventions. After 5 years we see almost complete convergence in earnings,
employment, and health.
These medium-run results diverge from some of the short-run results in important ways.
For instance, in Blattman and Dercon (2018), we saw evidence that the start-up grant
dramatically raised short-run productivity. While those offered the grant weren’t working
many more hours than the control or job offer groups, their earnings were a third higher.
This corresponded to nearly PPP$1 a day greater income—a huge amount considering that
counterfactual earnings were only about PPP$3 (or about $1 a day at 2010 price levels
and market exchange rates). After 5 years, we find that the new microenterprises and
productivity boost are not sustained and that the control and start-up grant groups converge
within a few years. At best, the cash acted as like a temporary boost to earnings with shortterm consumption impacts rather than a permanent lift out of poverty.
Another example is the effects of industrial work on health. Our 1-year results showed
and the health of children (Kabeer, 2002; Hewett & Amin, 2000; Atkin, 2009; Getahun & Villanger, 2016).

3

that those who took the factory job were more likely to report substantial health problems a
year after the job offer, even though the average employee quit after a few weeks or months.
Were these health problems temporary or lasting? We returned with a battery of expanded
measures, and pre-specified health as our second primary outcome after incomes. After 5
years, we see no evidence of long term adverse effects from the industrial work. Those assigned to the industrial job offer have 3 months more cumulative experience in factories than
the control group, and neither reduced-form treatment effects or an instrumental variables
approach suggest that this added factory work reduced health in the long run.
Such longer-term results are useful for a few reasons. First, they allow us to rule out
sustained or transformative impacts of the cash grants. There are few studies on the effects of
cash transfers in early industrializing areas, let alone long term follow ups. Our findings are
consistent with a 9-year evaluation of group cash transfers in Uganda, however (Blattman,
Fiala, & Martinez, 2018). Second, as more societies industrialize, it is also important to
know whether industrial work can lead to large, chronic, and unanticipated health problems.
At least in this instance, the adverse health effects seem to have been temporary.
Finally, we wanted to assess longer run impacts of the industrial job offer on income and
employment. We might not expect earnings gains in industrial work after one year, because
entry-level wages are so low. Even so, by fostering experimentation with a new sector, new
matches, and allowing ‘good’ types to get a foot in the door, we may see their wages rise
with tenure and from climbing up the job ladder (even if this is a minority of those assigned
to the job).
Figures 1a and 1b summarize the paths of income and employment in all three arms
over the 5 years, with all results deflated to 2010 Birr. The jump in weekly earnings and
employment in all three groups in the first year suggests that people self-selected into the
sample of job applicants because they were new labor market entrants or had suffered a
shock. Likely this is both a life-cycle effect from youth increasing hours and earnings over
time and perhaps rapid recovery from any adverse shocks to employment that propelled
people into the sample.

(a) Mean income (all profits and wages) in past
week across time for all cohorts

(b) Mean hours worked across time for all cohorts

Note that the figure makes it seem that job offer and control group incomes are stagnating
from years 1 to 4, and that the start-up grant group is converging down to their level. This
is possible, and indeed we see evidence of microenterprise exit. But this is also a period of
high inflation, and nominally earnings and consumption are rising. At the same time, this is
a period of high inflation and the national inflation index (the only available measurement)
could exaggerate the flatness of poor young people’s incomes. In any case, we see no sustained
effect of cash on income or consumption.
In the end, only one in six people remain in factory work, even among those randomly
offered the job. From our data and qualitative work, it seems that people in all three arms
used factory jobs as a safety net to smooth income temporarily until other less rigid and
less risky work could be found. Altogether, these medium-run results are consistent with
the simple alternative hypothesis that industrial jobs are not higher-quality and "rare" jobs,
but rather are average to low quality jobs where labor markets function normally.
In the end, a main takeaway from this experiment is that two of the interventions that
some schools of thought think should have large lasting effects on poverty simply do not have
these impacts, at least in this setting and with young women. One interpretation is that
one-off interventions and nudges addressing a single or small number of market failures may
not be lasting. Powerful forces may push individuals back towards equilibrium outcomes
irrespective of interventions. This is largely speculative, but if more interventions in more
places fail to find long run effects of initially-successful poverty or employment interventions,
it may challenge the widespread marginalist view of poverty alleviation. This could push
interventions to be more multifaceted addressing multiple barriers at once, and perhaps
addressing constraints at the local or macro level as well.

Setting

Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and also one of the poorest. 27 percent live under $2 a day in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, and agriculture
employs 85 percent of the workforce. Like many African countries, the underdeveloped private sector has offered few formal sector jobs. Youth unemployment and underemployment
are high. Most young people are engaged in informal wage work or self-employment.
At the same time, Ethiopia is also one of the fastest growing economies in the region,
with GDP growth of roughly 10% per year from 2006–16. In particular, Ethiopia has become
a growing export hub in horticulture, textiles, and leather. Although the economy has been
moving in fits and starts through the early stages of of industrialization, Ethiopia has been
touted as one of China’s successors in light manufacturing (The Economist, 2014). The
country has several advantages from a manufacturer’s point of view: low wages, a politically
stable and foreign investment-friendly regime, a domestic market of 94 million people, and
proximity to Europe.
Over the last two decades, there has been a transformation in Ethiopia’s urban labor
markets. They have become more flexible, with rising importance of private sector work, no
obvious skill premiums between the private and public sector, and lower (but still considerable) urban unemployment. In all the firms in our study, and in general across the private
sector, employers can set wages without any legal restriction or reference to union deals. The
governing labor law makes it also relatively straightforward to fire an employee.
In the years prior to our study, 2000–08, national income and industrial output both grew
about 10 percent per year, with the number of medium and large manufacturers doubling in
number (CSA, 2011). The beginning of the study period was first a boom time followed by
a mild slow down. Even so, during this period new foreign firms were entering the market
and starting small plants, and some domestic firms were continuing to invest and expand.
Growth picked up later in the study period, and again Ethiopia is now one of the fastest
growing economies in the region.

export-oriented. Only one was foreign-owned.
Eligible job applicants were recruited and screened in the firms’ standard fashion, described below. Only these screened applicants were eligible for one of the two treatments:
an industrial job offer or the start-up grant package.
Table 1 reports baseline characteristics of these screened applicants, from self-reported
surveys.7 80 percent were women. The average applicant was 22 and had completed grade
9. Most were unmarried. They had 7.5 hours of work per week, typically a portfolio of
activities such as farming, casual labor, or petty business. They had earned little cash in
the previous month. Only 27 percent had worked in a large, formal firm before, and only 19
percent in a factory. Based on qualitative interviews, most applicants had only a hazy idea
of the type and difficulty of the work in advance, and often only learned the salary being
offered at the time of hiring.

3.2.1

Interventions
"Start-up" grant and training

The core of the start-up treatment was an unconditional cash grant of nearly 5000 Birr, or
roughly $300. (see Table 2).8 We chose the $300 amount based on our qualitative assessment
of the costs required to set up a small part-time enterprise. While we framed the cash grant as
a business start-up fund, throughout the intervention we made clear that it was nonetheless
an unconditional grant and grantees were free to use it as they saw fit—savings, consumption,
or investment.
To encourage and enable business start-up, however, grantees initially received five days
of business training and planning.9 Professional skills trainers led classes of about 20, and
each person also received individual mentoring during those five days.10 Subjects had to
7

Applicants completed a 90-minute baseline survey plus 45 minutes of interactive games, with real money,
to measure time and risk preferences, and cognitive abilities such as executive function. An Ethiopian
enumerator delivered surveys and the games verbally in the local language. The games remunerated the
respondent with roughly a half days wages.
8
The grant amount varied slightly from cohort to cohort because of inflation, currency devaluation, and
tax issues. For cohorts 2 to 4, a for-profit firm ran the intervention and was required to withhold tax on
the grants. To minimize the tax burden the cash was disbursed in two tranches several weeks apart. We
used a for-profit firm because we could not find a non-profit organization willing to disburse cash without
conditions at low cost. For cohorts 5 to 8, we ran the intervention through a parastatal research organization
to avoid the tax burden. The amount of the grant was increased to maintain the rough purchasing power
and disbursed in a single tranche to reduce implementation costs.
9
Total implementation cost of training and grant was roughly $450 per person including the grant, training, and local program administration.

Cohorts 2 and 3 also received a follow-up visit by the trainer after three months for additional advice.

Industrial job offer

The jobs involved working on production lines where the workers bottled water, picked and
packed produce and flowers, cut fabric, or sewed shoes. They could involve heavy machinery
or simple tools.
In terms of eligibility, the positions required no previous work experience. Applicants had
to be healthy and able-bodied. All firms also had a minimum education requirement —grade
6 in the two rural horticulture firms, and grade 8 or 10 in the more urban manufacturing
ones. Most firms had separate jobs for men and women, and depending on the position they
were hiring for, they would specify a gender.
The positions required 45 to 50 hours per week over 5 or 6 days. At the time of the
baseline surveys, the jobs typically paid a wage of $1 to $1.50 per day at 2010 market
exchange rates (where $1 = 13.5 birr in 2010). Some firms offered non-wage benefits such
as on-site health care and bus transport.
The workplaces were professional and well-maintained, and firms never coerced employees. Nonetheless, health risks were common, especially: air quality (dust particles or chemical
fumes); discomfort and fainting from standing or lack of breaks or water; and safety hazards
such as wet floors, sharp instruments, and so forth. In interviews, workers who used cleaning
solvents, pesticides, dyes and glues sometimes reported fainting from inhalation.
Most firms were unionized, but these were generally worker associations that mediated
disputes but did not engage in collective bargaining. Occasionally, however, we did observe
short strikes or walkouts in response to salary delays.

3.3.1

Recruitment
Firm recruitment and selection

We approached roughly 300 firms, about half of all private industrial firms in Ethiopia with
50 or more employees.11 We contacted them by phone or walk-in. To be eligible for the
study, a firm had to be in manufacturing or commercial farming, expect to hire a batch of
at least 15 low-skill, full-time workers, and be willing to randomly assign job offers among
screened applicants.
Grantees did not see this service as helpful, and given the cost it was discontinued after cohort 3.
11
We identified these firms through applications for investment certificates, public business listings, industry associations, and personal contacts.

10

The limiting factor was whether a firm had imminent large expansion plans. Only a
handful had plans to open a entire new production line and hire a large batch of workers
at once.12 Firms with more modest expansion plans were a poor fit for the study, as they
planned to hire people piecemeal, to accommodate more gradual growth and cope with
regular attrition.
Randomization was seldom an issue, and more than three-quarters of the firms we approached were open to the study.13 While one might expect that firms want to select the
best workers, low-skill entry-level positions were often filled without a substantive interview
process. In most of the firms we approached, entry-level hiring was ad hoc in the sense
firms filling low-skill positions on a first-come, first-hire manner, with little or no interview
process.
What are these five study firms a case of? Our data suggest the jobs are similar to
other labor-intensive, low-skill, entry-level positions in the large textile, garment, footwear,
beverage, and commercial farming sectors, and thus different from positions in higher-skill
and heavier or more capital-intensive manufacturing. Compared to a representative sample of
industrial firms in 2014 in the capital Addis Ababa, our five firms had higher revenues, lower
profits, two to three times as many production employees, and lower-skilled employees.14
It is reasonable to worry that firms willing to randomize employment were poorly managed or had unusual turnover. While possible, qualitatively we saw little difference between
our firms and the others we approached. On the contrary, all were expanding employment,
suggesting they had more credit and higher returns to investment than others.
12
One reason is that sector growth was slowing in this period. 2010 to 2012 in Ethiopia was a period
of moderate government financial repression and pre-election uncertainty. Despite a growing economy and
a boom in some sectors, such as construction, many of the existing firms we approached were temporarily
holding off on growth plans. Other common sources of delay included difficulty in obtaining licenses, foreign
exchange, importing equipment, and obtaining parts. At least two other firms intended to participate, but
suffered prolonged delays and did not open their new line during the study period. Also, some sector growth
was coming from new firms, often foreign-owned, who were reluctant to participate because their start-up
was already complicated enough.
13
They typically expressed interest in participation in the study for several reasons: curiosity in the
answer; the opportunity to bring some structure to relatively unstructured hiring processes; and an interest
in learning more about their applicant pool and the other opportunities available to their employees.
14
Given the low-skill nature of the work and the entry-level positions, starting salaries were lower than the
manufacturing average—at roughly the 25th percentile of manufacturers in the capital. Since most of our
firms are outside the capital, the purchasing power of their wages is greater, probably putting them between
the 25th and 50th percentile in terms of wages. Moreover, comparing wages to the distribution quoted in the
2009/10 census of manufacturing firms suggest that they were not at all uncommon for the specific sectors
involved. The modal workers in the census earned between 400-600 birr in 2010 prices, with the second most
common interval 200-400 birr, jointly making up 40 percent of the workforce in manufacturing in general
and more than 60 percent in textiles or footwear (CSA, 2011). The wages of the workers in our sample fall
in these ranges.

11

3.3.2

Sample recruitment and selection

We followed each firms’ normal procedures for hiring batches of new employees to staff new
production lines. The firms advertised jobs through a posting on the front gate, word of
mouth, and local job boards.15 Applicants were instructed to gather on a specific day. Firm
managers would then screen written or verbal applications, typically based on job-specific
gender, education, and health requirements. Across all 8 cohorts, between 75 and 95 percent
of applicants passed these criteria and thus entered the study sample. We do not have data
on ineligible applicants.
A research team from Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) and the Ethiopian Development Research Institute (EDRI) then debriefed eligible applicants on the study, the start-up
start-up arm arm, and the survey and randomization procedures. Nearly all agreed to enter
the study, completed a baseline survey, and entered the lottery.
Following randomization, the firm posted the names of people receiving the job offer
at the factory site and the IPA/EDRI research team contacted all those assigned to two
treatment arms. Job offers began within a few days and the start-up training and grants
within a few weeks.
We gave each firm a list of unsuccessful applicants and asked the firm not to hire them
for at least 1–2 months. In practice, however, the firms kept poor records and within a few
days or weeks of the randomization could have hired control group members.

3.4

Randomization and balance

We randomized by cohort, stratified by gender, using a uniform random variable generator.
304 were assigned to the job offer, 285 to the start-up grant arm, and 358 to the control arm.
Table 2 reports tests of randomization balance, where we regress each covariate on treatment indicators plus randomization block (cohort-gender) fixed effects. This sample is somewhat imbalanced across the treatment arms at baseline. As Table 1 shows, of the 34 covariates across two treatments, 8 of the 68 mean differences (12 percent) have p < .1. Those
assigned to jobs are less likely to be married and have slightly lower executive functions and
education compared to the control group. Those assigned to the entrepreneurship program
15

In order to ensure sufficient applicants, we only made one change to standard procedures: we assisted
the firm in posting more notices within a wider radius than usual (usually no more than a few kilometers).
Since the firm typically drew employees from this radius, we expected this to generate an applicant pool
very similar to the usual one. It is possible, however, that the experimental pool of applicants is further
outside the family/friend network, and lives slightly further from the factory, than would otherwise have
been the case. That said, most applicants live within a few miles of the firm, and so are extremely local by
any measure. (The firms, who were reluctant to hire people who lived far away, reported that they did not
think the distance would make a material difference, since all live nearby.)

12

have lower assets and more firm experience. A test of joint significance of all covariates has
a p-value of 0.04 for the job offer and 0.01 for the entrepreneurship program. To minimize
bias, we control for baseline covariates when estimating treatment effects.

3.5
3.5.1

Outcomes
1- and 5-year endline data

We conducted follow-up surveys roughly 1 and 5 years after assignment to the two treatments.
At each of these two endlines, we attempted to reach each respondent twice, roughly 2–3
months apart, to measure our main outcomes twice. We did so to improve statistical precision
with highly-variable outcomes such as earnings or consumption (McKenzie, 2012).16
During site visits to several dozen factories and commercial farms, we conducted informal
interviews with workers and managers. At each study firm we systematically interviewed
managers at every level from senior management to line managers. Research assistants also
interviewed 138 workers and microenterprise owners, both in and out of the sample. They
also conducted 60 exit interviews by phone with sample members who quit the study firms.
3.5.2

Attrition

Our sample frequently moved between survey rounds. We were able to track down 88% after
1 year and 84.3% after five.17 Appendix Table A.1 reports the correlates of attrition after 5
years, from a simple regression of an attrition indicator on baseline covariates.
After 1 year, all treatment arms were roughly as likely to be found. After 5 years,
those assigned to the job offer were no more likely to be found after five years than the
control group. But those assigned to the start-up arm were roughly 5 percentage points
more likely to be found and interviewed. Controlling for baseline covariates, this difference
is not statistically significant, but it is potentially substantively important. Thus, below, we
will consider the robustness of our estimates to alternative attrition scenarios and sensitivity
analysis.
Otherwise, attrition is mostly uncorrelated with baseline characteristics. The exception
is marriage, as unmarried individuals at baseline are 6.5 percentage points less likely to be
found after five years. Women commonly move to become married, and this may account
for their loss.
16

For the 1-year survey, we also attempted to interview the household head once, since the sample member
may have been a dependent and unaware of household labor allocations, wealth, and attitudes. At the 5-year
survey, given that the sample is considerably older, we did not interview household heads.
17
For discussion of the rates and pattern of attrition for the 1-year endline survey, see Blattman and
Dercon (2018).

13

3.5.3

Primary outcomes and dealing with multiple outcomes

Based on the 1-year findings, our pre-analysis plan for the 5-year endline pre-specified two
primary outcomes of interest: income and physical health. As secondary outcomes we specified an interest in occupational choice and quality. We designated all other outcomes as
exploratory.18
We divided outcomes into primary and secondary to minimize the number of hypotheses
tested. To further minimize comparisons, we assembled our various measures into a family index of income and a family index of health. Our tables report treatment effects on
the components of these indexes as well, but those comparisons should be regarded as exploratory. At present we have not adjusted our p-values for multiple comparisons across the
two primary measures or within these indexes.

3.6

Estimation

To estimate program impacts on outcome Y , we calculate the intent-to-treat (ITT) estimate
of the job offer and start-up arms via OLS:

(1)

Yirj = αj + γr=13 + θJ Jobij + θE Startupij + βXij + ij

where Job and Startup are indicators for random assignment to the treatment arms. To
account for observed baseline imbalance and endline attrition, we control for the baseline
covariates, X, listed in Table 1, as well as gender-cohort fixed effects, αj . Recall that at each
endline we surveyed respondents in two different rounds r, collecting the same outcome two
times. Each round enters the regression as a separate observation, and we cluster standard
errors by individual and include a fixed effect, γr=2 , forthe second round.
Note that all outcomes are self-reported, and each treatment arm was aware of their
assignment and the existence of other arms. Thus, there is the potential for self-reported
outcomes to vary with treatment status. As with most low-income countries, there are no
administrative data on earnings. And as with most countries, there are no systematic and
available administrative data on health or informal earnings.

Results

4.1

Economic impacts

Table 3 reports 1- and 5-year ITT estimates for measures of income and employment levels.
Figures 1a and 1b in the introduction trace the earnings and employment results over time,
and this table expands the range of measures and components.
Income and employment levels Our primary economic outcome is income. We have
two measures of income, pre-specified, that we combine into an income family index. One is
the sum of weekly cash earnings across 22 different occupations. Earnings are seasonal and
do not reflect home production, so we also consider a measure of non-durable consumption
in the previous 4 weeks via an abbreviated consumption module of 82 items.19
In the start-up grant arm, we see a striking short-run divergence followed by convergence
within 5 years. Income increases 0.16 standard deviations after one year (including a one
third increase in reported earnings and a nearly 10% increase in consumption), but there is
virtually no income effect after 5 years. This temporary income effect from the grant was
driven mainly by increased hours of work, almost all through the channel of self-employment
in retail trades. We see little difference in earnings per hour reported worked. This increase
in employment also disappeared after 5 years.
In contrast, we see no evidence of an effect of a factory job offer on income or total hours
of work after 1 or 5 years.
Unemployment and occupational choice Recall from Figures 1a and 1b above that
both incomes and hours of employment rose steeply in the first year. They stagnated or fell,
however, in the subsequent 4 years. Figure 2 looks at employment and occupational choice
on the extensive margin (pre-specified as secondary outcomes of interest). The probability of
being employed fell slightly between the 1 and 4 year endline. One reason is that a few young
women exited the labour force. Others who are unemployed report looking for employment.
Examining trends in the control group gives insight to the life-cycle effects of occupational
choice in our sample. While slightly more individuals entered self employment between the
1 and 5 year surveys, this increase in employment was counteracted by exit from factory and
non-factory wage jobs.
18

See https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/2198
See Beegle, De Weerdt, Friedman, and Gibson (2012) for this approach. This abbreviated measure likely
understates total consumption by excluding durable asset use and less common purchases. Note that we
also pre-specified a third measure of income, an index of almost two dozen durable assets. Due to a survey
programming error, however, these durables data were mistakenly not collected in the 5-year endline.
19

16

Figure 2: Employment status and program impacts for work in past 2 weeks after 1 and 5
years

The start-up grant initially had a strong effect on self employment. After 1 year, 41% of
this arm were engaged in self-employment. In fact, 78% of the start-up arm attempted selfemployment at any time over five years, and most of this experimentation took place within
the first year of receiving the treatment (Table 4). There are some lingering effects of this
after 5 years. The start-up grant arm are still slightly more likely to be self-employed (not
statistically significant). But the fall from 1-year levels of self-employment is precipitous,
suggesting that even this occupational choice impact may be converging.
This finding runs counter to the notion that individuals in our sample would be successful
in entrepreneurial work if they could only overcome barriers to starting a small business. The
start-up arm induces significantly higher levels of experimentation with self-employment
employment. But the large number of people who were induced to start small enterprises do
not appear to have stuck with them five years later.
One of the other patterns we see across the five years of the study is rapid exit from
factory work. To understand the rapid rate of exit from factory jobs, we begin with evidence
from Blattman and Dercon (2018), where we analyzed the first year of qualitative data and
patterns in the panel. A few findings stand out:
• We saw no evidence of an industrial wage premium in our five firms. A simple nonexperimental wage comparison suggested that industrial jobs seemed to pay almost a

quarter lower wages than informal opportunities.
• Industrial work came with more stable employment hours, though only modestly so.
Most members of the control arm were able to find full-time informal work by the
time of the 1-year endline. Informal work also tended to pay higher wages than the
industrial firms, but it typically came with the risk of short unemployment spells. Over
the horizon of a month or a year, however, earnings in the industrial sector were no
more stable than the alternatives.
• A third of people offered an industrial job quit the study firm in the first month, and
77 percent quit within the year. People generally quit the sector altogether, rather
than simply switch firms. Firm managers said they found the high levels of turnover
inconvenient, but were generally able to fill the positions with other low-skill workers.
• Qualitatively, our interviews suggested that young people used low-skill industrial jobs
more as a safety net than a long-term job, and where self-employment and informal
work were typically preferred to, and more profitable than, industrial jobs.
What do we see in the subsequent four years? First, looking again at Figure 2, participation in factory work has declined in the control group between the 1- and 5-year endlines,
falling from 18% to below 12% at the extensive margin. In other words, the high rate of
exit from factory jobs continued after year 1, such that the job-offer individuals are not
significantly more likely to be in factory jobs five years later.
Even though few are employed in factories at the 5-year endline, the control group continued to experiment with factory work at a similar pace as they did in the first year of the
study. (As Table 4 shows, the control group had on average 2 months of factory work by the
one year follow up, and 5 months by the five-year follow up.)
Even after 5 years, the job offer results in nearly 3 additional months of lifetime experience
in factories – a one third increase over the control group mean. About half of this gain
comes from the first year after the offer. About half comes in the subsequent 3 years (not
statistically significant). The small but steady exposure of the control group to factory work
bolsters the earlier interpretation that these are unpleasant jobs that our sample used as a
last resort.
We also see that the start-up grant deters people from sampling factory work, to some
extent. After 5 years, the start-up arm are significantly less likely to be engaged in factory
work, and have only a third as many months of cumulative factory experience. We can also
interpret this as consistent with unemployed workers seeking factory work as a last resort in

19

times of need. The start-up grant had higher incomes after 1 year, allowing them to avoid
factory work for a time.
Finally, we see no evidence that these spells of factory employment have effects on long
term incomes or hours of work. Appendix Table A.3 reports the complier average causal
effect of assignment to the job offer or start-up grant, where we use assignment to treatment
as an instrument for length of time in the industrial sector. That is, we use the estimates
in Table 4 as a “first stage”. This instrumental variables (IV) estimate is useful for understanding whether a longer spell of past employment in the industrial sector has long term
effects on outcomes such as income and employment. For instance, the spell could lead to
experience, social networks, or shocks that improve or hinder future employment prospects.
The instrument is weak by the 5-year endline, since the cumulative effect on months of employment has fallen to 3 months (a 33% increase). This contributes to noisy IV estimates.
Nonetheless, we see nothing to suggest that employment or income prospects improve with
longer spells of factory employment. If anything there is a small but noisy adverse effect on
incomes and employment levels.
Figure 3: Net present value of intervention according to treatment effects on income

Cost-benefit analysis Figure 3 shows the net present value of both the job offer and the
start-up grant interventions. In each survey round – baseline, 1-year, and 5-year – we report
20

the treatment effects of the interventions on earnings and linearly interpolate between them.
We take the cumulative sum of such treatment effects across all 5 years and discount the
sum at a 5% annualized rate. This gives us a relatively generous estimate of the net present
value.
The figure shows how far the start-up grant intervention is from being a cost-effective
program of poverty reduction, in comparison to its $300 grant amount and $450 total operating cost. As noted in Blattman and Dercon (2018), the effects on earnings of the start-up
grant after 1 year amounted to only 16% of the total $300 grant amount.

Standard errors are clustered at the level of the respondent due to having two observations per person. All observations are weighted by the
inverse of their sampling probability and the inverse of their predicted probability of attrition using a Leave-One-Out logistic predictive method.
Control means are also calculated using these weights.

Health impacts

One year after receiving the job offers, we found evidence of reduced health outcomes, as
measured by self-reported ability to perform activities of daily life, among those who were
assigned to the factory job. Did these persist?
For the long-run data collection, we collected an expanded set of health measures from
the first endline survey. First, we used an expanded list of fifteen activities to improve
21

our measurement of ability to perform activities of daily activities, ranging from 0 to 45.
Second, we conducted a comprehensive questionnaire covering a list of twenty symptoms of
ill health. Here respondents could report the regularity with which they experienced these
physical symptoms from zero (never) to three (often), without having to be diagnosed with
a particular condition. Third, we asked about four specific health conditions that are particularly common among individuals working in industrial work, namely: asthma, respiratory
problems, dermatitis, and carpal tunnel. Fourth, to more accurately measure respiratory
health, and verify our self-reported measures, we conducted a spirometry procedure. Here
we followed guidelines from the European Respiratory Society, reported in Moore (2012). For
the main results we report on indicator for whether the spirometry test shows an abnormal
reading, indicating a respiratory problem.
In the pre-analysis plan we committed to report the effect of the two treatments on these
four aggregate measures. Table 5 shows these results. We find that these negative health
effects do not persist. Health outcomes are not significantly different for either treatment
group across a wide range of measures.
There are two possible interpretation of these findings. The first is that the maladies
experienced one year after receiving the factory job offer were not chronic. The second
is that the control group was exposed to hazardous factory work in the interim and have
experienced the same health problems as a result. The evidence favors the first explanation.
First, in absolute terms, the sample is in good health, perhaps even slightly improved
over time. Serious disability rates after 5 years are half of what they were after 1 year,
suggesting many of the problems reported in the previous endline were temporary.
Second, we see no evidence that those who stayed longer in factory work have poorer
health. Appendix Table A.4 reports complier average causal effects using assignment to
treatment as an instrument for length of time in the industrial sector (see Table 4). After
1-year, these IV estimates showed serious adverse effects on health. After 5 years we see
no such evidence. While it is true that the instrument is considerably weaker after 5 years,
the IV estimate for physical health or serious disabilities is close to zero, and the confidence
interval does not include the 1-year point estimate.

Discussion and conclusions

We report on the labor market trajectories of almost 1000 young and mostly unemployed
women in Ethiopia. We also report on two interventions that many have reasonably proposed
could have had large and lasting effects on long run labor market outcomes: among people
appearing to queue for industrial employment, offering an entry-level factory job in a country
22

that is just beginning to industrialize; and offering approximately one year of factory wages
as a cash grant plus some business training.
We learn both from the descriptive analysis of the panel and the experiments. We find,
after five years, neither intervention has any effect on the likelihood to still work that sector
after 5 years, compared to the control group (although the start-up grant group were less
likely to experiment with factory employment). Earnings and consumption are also no
different in any of these groups. The labour market choices and outcomes for our population
have roughly the same structure and earnings that the treated would have had without the
intervention.
This is doubly important because of the promising short-term evidence that the startup grant increased productivity and earnings by a third. Within 5 years, however, these
productivity gains seem to have dissipated.
There are reasons to believe these (mostly) young women did not have high sustained
returns to self-employment relative to non-industrial wage work. The businesses may simply
have failed or faded away gradually over time, as the women failed to reinvest earnings in the
business. It is also possible that the business was simply a form of savings and consumption
smoothing in an economy where the real interest rate from cash savings is as low as -15-20% due to high inflation and the high cost of local savings institutions (which offer negative
nominal interest rates). Investing in a small enterprise may simply be the most efficient way
of maximizing consumption of a grant. For instance, at a real interest rate of -15%, a 5000
birr grant could be consumed completely in 5 years by spending 54 birr per month. But at
a real interest rate of 5% for example (supposing this is what a business or other savings
vehicle could earn), a 5000 birr grant could provide a monthly payment of 94 per month over
the same period, almost double.
Plausibly, the number of constraints on entrepreneurial success in this setting meant that
lifting a single, marginal constraint such as investment capital is not enough to have a lasting
return for this particular group of young mainly female workers. Given that many of the
microenterprises folded, we suspect that low returns to capital given other barriers is a likely
factor. Of course, it is also possible that our sample – drawn from a population queuing for a
factory job – are per definition not terribly representative, nor full of entrepreneurial talent.
Still, evidence points to a large number of them regularly engaging in some self-employment
as a temporary alternative to wage work.
Our results also bolster a view that industrial work is not particularly high-quality, and
not particularly skilled and high-paying (at least at this stage of development in Ethiopia).
Wages were no better than in other low-paid sectors, jobs were unpleasant and seemingly hazardous, and (most worryingly) those that spent more months in factory work reported more
23

serious health problems after one year. Nevertheless, for some it offered another employment
option seemingly worth taking, at least for some time during the five years studied.
Naturally there are limits to what we can learn from five sites and five firms. Yet the same
is true of any single program evaluation. Our start-up program is comparable in many respects to a suite of anti-poverty programs that give youth start-up capital, and the industrial
results speak to low-skill light industry in contexts where workers are effectively disposable
to firms. This is also a reasonable description of early and middle-stage industrialization in
the US, Europe, and Asia.
