The Impact of Internet Subsidies in Public Schools
Austan Goolsbee and Jonathan Guryan
NBER Working Paper No. 9090
August 2002
JEL No. I2, H2
ABSTRACT
In an effort to alleviate the perceived growth of a digital divide, the U.S. government enacted a
major subsidy for Internet and communications investment in schools starting in 1998. The program
subsidized spending by 20-90 percent, depending on school characteristics. Using new data on school
technology usage in every school in California from 1996 to 2000 as well as application data from the
E-Rate program, this paper shows that the subsidy did succeed in significantly increasing Internet
investment. The implied first-dollar price elasticity of demand for Internet investment is between –0.9
and –2.2 and the greatest sensitivity shows up among urban schools and schools with large black and
Hispanic student populations. Rural and predominantly white and Asian schools show much less
sensitivity. Overall, by the final year of the sample, there were about 66 percent more Internet classrooms
than there would have been without the subsidy. Using a variety of test score results, however, it is clear
that the success of the E-Rate program, at least so far, has been restricted to the increase in access. The
increase in Internet connections has had no measurable impact on any measure of student achievement.

I. Introduction
As the Internet has grown over the last five years, inequality of access and understanding
of technology across income and racial lines has led to concern among policymakers about the
so-called digital divide. It has generated many proposals to help close the divide, by both
governments and private entities like the Gates Foundation.
Policymakers and analysts have argued that public schools are the natural place to teach
underserved populations about computers. As part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the
government began actively subsidizing Internet and telecommunications access in U.S.
classrooms and libraries through a tax on long-distance services as a new, information-age
component of the Universal Service Fund.1 This new initiative, known as the E-Rate program,
began in 1998 and provides up to $2.25 billion per year of subsidies to school and library
investment in Internet and communications technology. To understand the magnitude of this
subsidy, note that Lake (2000) estimates total public school spending on computers in 1999
(including hardware, software, training, networking, etc.) was only $3.3 billion. The E-rate
subsidy is, by far, the most ambitious federal technology program in schools.2
Understanding the extent to which the $2.25 billion subsidy fulfilled its primary goal of
increasing Internet usage in schools, particularly disadvantaged ones, versus merely subsidizing
spending that was already taking place, is thus of first order importance.

There is also

considerable interest in—and debate about—whether spending on computers and information
technology has any impact on student performance (see Kirkpatrick and Cuban, 1998; Angrist

1

This tax itself is not without controversy as Hausman (1998) suggests it generates more than a dollar of efficiency
cost for every dollar it raises.
2
It is also large by the standards of other universal service subsidies. Crandall and Waverman (2000), for example,
calculate that the annual cost of universal service subsidies for telephone service was less than $2.2 billion (in 1998),
for electricity less than $1.2 billion (in 1990), and for natural gas about $1.5 billion (in 1995).

1

and Lavy, 1999; Cuban, 2001) and the creators of the E-rate have argued that it can do more than
just increase access, that it can improve basic student performance.
In this paper we provide an economic analysis of the impact of the E-Rate program on
public schools’ technology adoption over the 1996-2000 period. To do so, we use new data on
the technology owned in each year by every school in California.

We merge these with

administrative data on every E-Rate funding application these same schools filed, including the
amount of funding, the subsidy rate, and purpose of the funding. We also use demographic data
for each school and district from the National Center for Education Statistics Common Core of
Data (CCD) and the 1990 U.S. Census.
We seek to determine whether schools with higher subsidy rates appeared to make
greater investments in technology than they would have without the program and, if so, whether
the increase in Internet access had any impact on observed student outcomes in the period. To
do so, we must confront three difficulties in analyzing the program.
First, there is a clear upward trend in Internet access among public schools well before
the program began. The data in U.S.D.O.E. (2000) on the share of public school classrooms with
access to the Internet, for example, shows the share increasing by a factor of five from 1994 to
1996 (from 3% in 1994 to 15% in 1996) followed by continued growth through 1999 (51% in
1998 and 63% in 1999). While it is true that the time series shows a major increase in access in
the first year of the E-rate program, it is important to distinguish the program's effect from
underlying trends. We do this by exploiting cross-sectional variation in the subsidy rate across
schools in the same time periods and by looking at growth rates rather than levels.
The second problem we deal with is the fact that the cross-sectional variation in the
subsidy rate (the subsidy rates range from 20 to 90 percent) depends on factors, such as the share

2

of pupils qualifying for subsidized school lunches, which are likely to be correlated with
unobserved tastes for technology in the school. To address these issues we include flexible
controls for the previous technology histories of these schools as well as the very school
demographic characteristics that drive the variation in subsidy rates.
The third problem, which leads to an independently interesting observation, is that
districts are allowed to selectively include schools on subsidy applications. The progressive
nature of the subsidy creates a stronger incentive for high-poverty districts to apply for funds.
The fact that the subsidy rate is determined by the combined school lunch percentage of
participating schools creates an incentive for wealthy schools to convince high-poverty schools
in the district to join their applications. We show evidence that districts and schools do respond
on both margins in predictable ways. While this observation is interesting as a window into the
workings of public schools, the resulting selection might lead to bias in our estimates. We are
careful to deal with this selection when estimating the impact of the subsidy on adoption rates.
The paper proceeds in eight parts. In section II, we describe the rules and history of the
E-Rate program. In section III, we describe the data and present summary statistics. In section
IV we present the identification framework. In section V we present the basic results. In section
VI, we examine which schools were more or less sensitive to the subsidy. And, in section VII
present results on student outcomes. In section VIII we conclude.

II. The E-Rate Program
On May 7, 1997, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted a Universal
Service Order implementing the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The Order was designed to
give all eligible schools and libraries affordable access to modern telecommunications and

3

information services. The program began on January 1, 1998 and provided up to $2.25 billion
annually (FCC, 1997a). It is known as the E-Rate program.
The E-Rate program was not designed to have the government provide technology to
schools but rather to subsidize schools’ purchases of such technology and to do so at a
progressively sliding rate that depends on poverty rates and urban/rural status. The subsidy rate
ranges from 20 to 90 percent depending on the share of students that qualify for the national
school lunch program as shown in table 1. 3
The subsidy can be used for spending on "all commercially available telecommunications
services, Internet access, and internal connections." This includes services like basic telephone
service, a T-1 line, telecommunications wiring, routers and switches, Local Area Networks, PBX
or other services whose primary purpose is delivering services into classrooms or other places of
instruction. Support for administrative functions of a library or school is permitted if it is "part
of the network of shared services for learning." (Department of Education, 1997a). Schools
cannot get subsidies for things like software, content or computers since they are not directly
related to connections. Detailed information on what is eligible can be found in FCC (2001).
Schools may apply for the program individually or as a school district.4 The subsidy rate
for individual schools is determined by the criteria in table 1. The subsidy rate for the district is
based on the average share of school lunch eligible students across all participating schools
(weighted by enrollment) but the rules require that the higher-level entities "must strive to ensure
that each school receives full benefit of discount to which entitled" (U.S.D.O.E., 1997b).
3

Note that the E-Rate subsidy is large compared to the computer budget of the schools but tiny compared with
overall school spending. This makes it extremely unlikely that schools would attempt to modify their school lunch
percentages (which are the basis of most other federal programs, as well) to get above the kink points of the E-Rate
subsidy schedule. Direct investigation also shows no evidence that schools altered eligibility percentages in
response to the E-rate subsidy rules.
4
Technically, schools may also apply across districts as consortia but this is extremely rare in practice and we
exclude the few consortia from our analysis.

III. Data
The data are drawn from three sources.

First, data from the U.S. and California

Departments of Education give information on every public school in California. Well known
data include enrollment counts by race, characteristics of teachers, and the fraction of students
eligible for the federal free and reduced price lunch programs. We also use new data, starting in
the 1996-1997, which include detailed school level information on the number of computers used
for instructional purposes and of the number of classrooms with Internet access in each school.
Additional demographic characteristics from the school district-level tabulation of the 1990
census, such as the median household income and the median home value are added.
The California data are merged with the second data set: administrative data from the
Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) on every E-Rate subsidy application over
the life of the program. Each application lists the total funds requested, the total funds granted,
the subsidy rate that applies to the request and a classification of the funds as Internet access,
telecommunications services, or internal connections. The breakdown of E-Rate funding by
intended use is shown in table 2. Eighty percent of E-Rate funds go to internal connections, 17
percent go to telecommunications services, and the remaining 3 percent are used for Internet
access.
For our analysis, we drop E-Rate applications by libraries, private schools and multidistrict consortia, which, combined, account for only about 10 percent of E-Rate spending in
California. To get a subsidy rate for each school, we aggregate the application data to the school
district level and use the average subsidy faced by applicant schools in the district.5 The district-

5

The standard errors are corrected to account for within-district correlation resulting from the fact that there is not
school level variation in the subsidy rate every year.

5

level data include funds requested and granted by type of request, and various measures of the
subsidy rate, such as the mean, median, and mode.6 Since schools within the district can
strategically apply in light of the progressive subsidy rate, we compute the subsidy rate as if all
the district’s schools applied. As shown in section VI, the results do not substantively change if
the predicted discount rate is used in its place.
Table 2 also summarizes the Internet and computer access in California’s public schools
over time. By the 1997-1998 school year, the year before the first E-Rate funding was awarded,
55 percent of California’s public schools had at least one classroom with Internet access, an
increase of 9 percentage points from a year earlier. Using the number of teachers as a measure
of the number of classrooms, we estimate that 26 percent of classrooms in California had Internet
access.7 In contrast, 93 percent of California schools used at least one computer for instructional
purposes in 1997-1998, while the average school had 2.2 computers per teacher.
As the E-Rate funds grew, Internet access was becoming more widespread. By 20002001, 85 percent of California schools had at least one classroom with Internet access, while
two-thirds of all classrooms in California had Internet access. The fraction of California schools
that used at least one computer for instructional purposes grew to 98 percent by 2000-2001,
while the number of computers per teacher grew to 3.1.
Over the same time period, the federal government transferred almost $937 million to the
public schools of California as a part of the E-Rate program. As has been shown in more detail
in Puma et. al. (2000), the bottom panel of table 2 shows the total E-Rate funding commitment
both nationally and in California. As is shown by the aggregate numbers, national E-Rate

6

We have done the analysis using the district level median, mode, maximum and minimum of the subsidy rate. The
results are not qualitatively different. We report only results using the mean due to space concerns.
7
The number of teachers is almost surely an overestimate of the number of classrooms. Thus, our estimate of the
fraction of classrooms with Internet access is a lower bound.

6

funding grew from $1.7 billion in 1998-1999 to $2.1 billion in 2000-2001. About 15 percent of
that funding went to applicants in California, where there was a sharp increase in requests in
2000-2001. This increase is entirely explained by the $230 million in E-Rate funding that the
Los Angeles Unified School District received that year.8 The next row of table 2 shows similar
estimates of the trend in E-Rate funding using the data in our sample
The strong time-series correlation between the spread of Internet access and the advent of
E-Rate funding does not, of course, establish a causal link. The E-Rate legislation was passed in
the midst of a strong upward trend in the fraction of schools with Internet access. Thus, even in
the absence of the federal subsidy, many school districts may have chosen to make Internet
investments. In other words, while the intent of the E-Rate subsidy was to create marginal
incentives for school districts to invest in Internet access and to help disadvantaged schools
especially, much of the total funds disseminated under the E-Rate program may have gone to
inframarginal districts.

It is thus instructive to document which districts received E-Rate

funding.
Returning to table 1, we can consider who, on average, received disproportionate funds
from the E-Rate program. On one hand, the E-Rate subsidy is more generous for poor districts,
so funding might be greater for the poorer schools. On the other hand, these poor districts tend
to have less technology. Rich districts may have more investment spending on computers and
the Internet and therefore get the lion’s share of the subsidy money, despite having a lower
subsidy rate. The data suggest that, in fact, the first consideration overwhelmed the second. The
table shows that a greater share of the funds went to the poorer schools than would be expected
by enrollment alone. Most of the E-Rate funds went to schools with subsidy rates of 80 and 90
percent—schools with more than 50 percent of their students eligible for free or reduced price
8

We repeated the analysis in the paper excluding Los Angeles and the results were not affected.

7

lunch from the federal government. The table also shows that the schools that received more
generous subsidies had fewer Internet classrooms prior to the E-Rate program. Thus, E-Rate
funding went disproportionately to schools with higher poverty rates and fewer Internet
classrooms.
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the data underlying the regressions in the next section. Figure 1
shows the average fraction of classrooms per district with Internet access. The yearly averages
are shown separately for each of five groups of districts. Group 1 are the richest districts—those
with less than 20 percent of their students eligible for the federal free or reduced lunch programs
in 1997-1998. These districts received the least generous E-Rate subsidy. Group 2 are districts
with between 20 and 40 percent of their students eligible for the federal free or reduced lunch
programs in 1997-1998. Groups 3, 4 and 5 are defined similarly. Group 5 districts have the
highest poverty rates and were eligible for the most generous subsidies. Figure 2 presents the
ratio of usage for each group relative to group 1.
As shown in figure 1, in 1996-1997 and 1997-1998 there was a strong negative
correlation between district poverty rates and Internet access. In the first year of the data, the
richest schools had almost 50 percent more Internet classrooms per teacher than the poorest
group, for instance. Over the next year (still before the E-Rate program), this discrepancy got
even larger. Once the E-Rate program began in 1998, however, and the two lowest groups began
receiving a large subsidy relative to the highest group, their relative number of Internet
connections accelerated until, by 2000, some actually exceeded the connections in the richest
school districts. This pattern can be seen clearly in figure 2. For each year, the figure shows the
mean number of Internet classrooms per teacher in each group relative to the wealthiest group of
schools. The figure highlights the reversal in Internet access rates of rich and poor schools—a

8

closing of the digital divide—that occurred in the years in which the E-Rate subsidy was offered.
It is also clear that most of the catch-up occurred among the poorest sets of schools, those
eligible for the largest subsidies.

IV. Identification
In this section we expand the suggestive analysis presented above to a regression
framework. Motivated by figure 1, to identify the effect of the subsidy on Internet investment
we estimate the following investment equation
(1)

∆I st = βs dt + α s + δ t + γ 1m st + γ 2 mst2 + ε st

where ∆ I st = I st − I st −1 is the number of Internet classrooms added to school s in year t, s dt is
the subsidy rate received by district d, α s and δ t are respectively school and year effects, m st is
the fraction of students eligible for the federal school lunch program, and ε st is an error term.
The school effects ( α s ) identify consistent differences in Internet investment rates over the
sample period, or put differently school-specific trends in Internet access. The coefficient of
interest is β , which measures the effect of the subsidy on Internet investment. Note that s dt is
zero in all years prior to 1998, and later is calculated as
(2)

s dt = f (mdt , A=1 )

where mdt , A=1 is the fraction of students eligible for the federal school lunch program in the
schools included on district d’s E-Rate application, and f (.) is defined as shown in table 1. We
observe s dt in the administrative E-Rate data. This subsidy rate depends on which schools are
included on the E-Rate application. Because this decision may be correlated with s dt , we

9

compute an alternative subsidy, the subsidy the district would have received if it had been forced
to include every school in the district on the application. This subsidy is computed as
~
s dt = f (mdt )

(3)

where mdt is the fraction of students eligible for free or reduced price lunch in all of district d.
We present estimates of equation (1) using both s dt and ~
s dt .
If the subsidy induced Internet investment, it is natural to ask whether this increase in
Internet access led to changes in student achievement. To this end, we estimate the following
test score equation
∆Tst +1 = β ′s dt + α s′ + δ t′ + γ 1′m st + γ 2′ m st2 + ε st′

(4)

where ∆Tst = Tst +1 − Tst is the one-year change in the test score. The specification allows a year
for Internet access to affect student achievement. Note that if ε st and ε st′ are uncorrelated,

β ′ β is the Instrumental Variables (IV) estimate the effect of Internet access on test scores.

V. Estimates
We now present estimates using the framework developed in the previous section. The
suggestive analysis in section III highlights strong trends in Internet access and a significant
relative increase in investment by high-poverty schools when the subsidy is offered.

The

regression framework includes year effects to control for secular trends in Internet investment
rates, school effects to control for persistent differences in technology investment rates, and
poverty measures to control for convergence related to income levels. The analysis asks whether
schools with more generous subsidies increased Internet investment rates relative to secular
trends in a way unexplained by poverty levels.

10

The results in column 1 look at all schools that applied for the E-Rate program. The
estimate of β is positive and significant implying that schools facing the biggest subsidy
starting in 1998, did have larger increases in the growth rate of Internet access.9 The magnitude
indicates that a ten-percentage-point increase in the E-Rate subsidy for appliers was associated
with an increase in the growth rate of Internet access of 0.78 classrooms per year. This estimate
corresponds to an elasticity of Internet investment with respect to the first subsidy dollar of
-2.27. Of course, since this is a linear specification, the marginal elasticity declines as the
subsidy increases. The marginal elasticity of Internet investment for appliers who are already at
the mean subsidy rate of 50.5 percent is closer to –0.53.
Using these results, we can estimate the total impact of the E-Rate program on Internet
adoptions among the appliers. For the mean school, if the subsidy rate were zero, the predicted
number of Internet connected classrooms would be 14.7 by the end of the sample period
(2000-01). In fact, the true level with the subsidy was some 66% higher at 24.4. We attribute
this rather substantial difference to the E-Rate subsidy. Given the mean underlying trend growth
in Internet connections estimated in the regression, however, this is the equivalent of moving up
adoption by almost four years (i.e., if would have taken 3.8 extra years of trend growth if there
were no subsidy to get to the level of Internet use observed in the last year of the data).
One alternative explanation of the results might be that as computer prices fall over time,
poor schools increasingly find it worthwhile to get connected where in earlier periods they did
not (although this does not explain why the gap between rich and poor schools expanded in the
year before the E-Rate program started). Or similarly, there could be some other unobserved
variable, correlated with being poor, that was increasing relative Internet investment in the time
9

The standard errors are corrected to account for within-district correlation resulting from the fact that there is not
school level variation in the subsidy rate every year.

11

period. As a comparison, we look at the Internet investment of schools that did not apply for the
E-Rate program. By definition, these schools do not have an observed subsidy rate so we give
each school the subsidy rate they would have received if their entire district had applied together.
These non-applying schools show no sensitivity to the subsidy rate.10 The coefficient is small
and not significant.
A second alternative explanation is that the selective nature of the sample of appliers is
biasing the results. Because subsidy rates do not reach 100 percent, districts with greater
demand for Internet investment should be more likely to apply for E-Rate funds. Further,
because subsidy rates are determined by the poverty rates of applicant schools, districts that
apply have an incentive to include high-poverty (and exclude low-poverty) schools on their
applications. This incentive is offset by efforts to ensure that E-Rate funds only go towards work
done at applicant schools. This is apparent in the data. Table 4 compares three groups of
schools in 1998 and 1999: schools that applied for E-Rate funds (column 1), schools that did not
apply but were in districts where other schools applied (column 2), and schools that did not apply
in districts where no one applied (column 3).
Districts that applied had higher school lunch eligibility rates (i.e., higher subsidy rates)
than districts that did not. And within districts that applied, the schools that took part had higher
school lunch eligibility rates than those that did not participate.

Note that schools appear to

have reacted fairly strongly to the economic incentives created by the program rules. This piece
of evidence is a window into the management of public schools and may be suggestive of how
they respond to outside economic forces. It also suggests there is a selection problem that we
must deal with in the estimation. Note, however, that in our regression results, we control for the
10

Comparing columns 1 and 2 is not a direct test of the impact of the E-Rate program, however, since it is still
possible that only schools without an interest in technology choose not to apply for E-Rate funding and this
unobservable difference accounts for the different price sensitivities across the specifications.

12

school’s poverty rate in a flexible way so bias can only result if selection is based on something
other than just the school lunch percentage.
To deal with selection bias, we combine schools that applied for E-Rate funding with
schools that did not and assign each of them the subsidy rate they would get if their entire school
district applied (results are very similar using the rate that the individual school would get if they
applied alone). The advantage is that this strategy avoids any problems caused by districts
selectively choosing which schools to include on applications. The disadvantage is that it
generates measurement error in the subsidy rate variable by assigning subsidy rates to schools
that did not apply (and thus cannot be responsive in the data). Thus, this strategy will tend to
produce an underestimate of the impact of the subsidy. We present this result in column 3. The
coefficient is smaller than just for the appliers but is still fairly large, positive and significant.
The first dollar price elasticity is now –0.96.
A third alternative explanation is that there are diminishing returns to expanding Internet
connections so schools that already have a lot of Internet connections will eventually slow down
their growth relative to schools that do not. To the extent the late-adopters are high-poverty
schools, the diminishing returns story could generate a spurious correlation with the subsidy rate.
In our specification, which assumes each school has a permanent trend in Internet investment, we
have ruled out diminishing returns. We examine this possibility in column 4 by interacting the
subsidy rate variable with the number of Internet connections the school had at the start of the
sample. If the diminishing returns argument is relevant in our time period, this interaction
should come in with a negative sign (greater connections to start leads to less price sensitivity).
Note that we do not include the initial number of connections at the school on its own because
this is absorbed in the school fixed effect.

13

The results show no significant difference in price sensitivity between schools that start
with a large number of Internet connections and schools that start with a small number. We also
estimate the regression interacting the effect of the subsidy with the starting number of
computers rather than number of Internet connections. Here, if anything, the sensitivity is
actually greater among those that started with more computers rather than less. The estimates
shown in column 5 indicate schools that started with more computers in 1996-97 were
significantly more responsive to the subsidy. The school with the mean number of computers in
1996-97 was more than twice as sensitive to the E-Rate subsidy than a school with no computers.
Perhaps this should not be surprising considering computers and Internet access are
complements. However, if our results were picking up spurious correlations due to diminishing
returns, or some other kind of mean reversion, we would expect to see schools with more
computers appear less—not more—responsive.

VI. Who is Most Price Sensitive?
The previous results, then, point to a significant impact of the E-Rate subsidy on public
schools’ Internet investment decisions. In this section we explore what types of schools are most
sensitive to the subsidy.
Our first results, presented in table 5, examine differences in price-sensitivity between
elementary, middle and high schools.11 These are shown in columns 1-3. The results indicate
that high schools have little sensitivity and that elementary schools are the most sensitive. These
regressions include all schools (appliers and non-appliers) to fully account for the selection

11

Elementary Schools are defined as schools that house at least one grade below 6th. Middle Schools are defined as
schools that house at least one of the 6th, 7th or 8th grades. And, High Schools are schools that house at least one
grade above 9th. Note that these definitions are not mutually exclusive.

14

biases. Perhaps high schools would all have increased Internet access regardless of the price,
whereas elementary schools are only willing to invest in technology if it is highly subsidized.
Next, in columns 4 and 5, we present estimates for urban and rural schools. The results
indicate that the rural schools are rather substantially less responsive to the subsidy program than
are urban schools. In column 6 we interact the subsidy rate with the share of students in the
school that are black, Hispanic, white and Asian. Interestingly, the sensitivity is significantly
higher among schools that are heavily black and Hispanic. The sensitivity of schools with high
white and Asian student populations is significantly smaller than the black and Hispanic
coefficients. Again note that these regressions do control for poverty level through the school
lunch percentage so race is not just a simple proxy for poverty level. It is possible, however, that
conditional on poverty status, higher minority population schools are more budget constrained
and therefore more sensitive to the subsidy rate.

VII. Outcomes
The analysis above presents evidence that is fairly clear on the success of the E-Rate
program in regards to its primary goal of getting classrooms connected to the Internet,
particularly at disadvantaged schools (see the statements of Riley, Glickman and Kantor, 1996;
Gore, 1997). In this section, however, we extend the evaluation to the next logical level, which
is to look at whether such investment has an impact on student performance. Many of the most
prominent supporters of the E-rate program, such as Clinton's Secretary of Education Richard
Riley, argued that the program should aspire to more than just wiring schools, that it "must show
that it really makes a difference in the classroom, and that means helping students to learn the
basics and other core subjects to high standards." (Riley, 1997).

15

In this section, we present some reduced-form estimates of the effect of the E-Rate
subsidy on student test scores. One can interpret the ratio of these coefficients to the coefficient
from the previous sections (.048) as instrumental variables estimates of the effect of Internet
access on student test scores.
We measure student achievement with the Stanford Achievement Test, which has been
given every year to each public school student in California beginning with the 1997-98 school
year. We use three measures of school-level achievement: the mean test score in the school, the
fraction of students scoring above the 75th percentile score for the state, and the fraction of
students scoring above the 25th percentile score for the state. We allow Internet access to affect
student achievement with a one-year lag, and estimate specifications analogous to those reported
in table 3.
The results are presented in table 6. The dependent variable is the increase in the
school’s test score and the regressor of interest is the subsidy rate. In the reported specifications,
we use the subsidy rate that the district would face if each school were included on the
application. We report estimates for math, reading and science test scores.
The results show no evidence that Internet investment had any measurable effect on
student achievement. None of the estimates reported in the table are statistically different from
zero, and in almost all cases the 95 percent confidence interval can rule out effects of any
significant magnitude. To see this, notice that the coefficient estimate of 0.002 on the mean
math score implies a 90 percent subsidy rate would increase math test scores by 0.18 points. The
standard deviation of school-level math scores is 39.6 points. Notice also, that the point estimate
implies adding one Internet classroom increases test scores by .04 points (.002/.048). Thus, it
would take 1,000 extra Internet classrooms to increase a school’s mean math score by 40 points,

16

or one standard deviation. Point estimates are larger for elementary and middle schools, and for
the fraction of students scoring above the statewide 75th percentile, though none is statistically
significant.
It is possible that it is too early to evaluate long-term investments in information
technology or that the gains took place in areas other than test scores (better researched papers,
for example), but thus far at least the increase of Internet investment appears to have not had a
measurable impact on student achievement. The lack of impact is certainly consistent with the
evidence discussed in Department of Education (2000b) that only one third of teachers reported
that they were well prepared or very well prepared to use computers and the Internet or in
Clarkson (2000) that most teachers surveyed are “novice or completely inexperienced” with
computers.

VIII. Conclusion
The rise of the Internet and the spread of a digital divide led to concern among policymakers about the implication for long-term economic inequality. This concern inspired the
expansion of the Universal Service Fund to subsidize Internet and communication technology
investment by more than $2 billion per year (itself more than half of all public school computer
spending in the year). The subsidy, called the E-Rate, was implemented in 1998 and provided a
sliding scale subsidy between 20 and 90 percent.
In this paper, we have taken a first step towards evaluating the effect the E-Rate subsidy
had on Internet investment in California’s public schools. We find that despite the strong pre1998 income gradient of Internet access, E-Rate funding went disproportionately to low-Internet
schools. We also show evidence that the E-Rate subsidy led to significant increases in Internet

17

investment by California schools. Overall by 2000, there were some 66 percent more classrooms
with Internet connections than there would have been without the subsidy. This is the equivalent
of accelerating Internet investment by about 4 years.
Urban schools, predominantly black and Hispanic schools and lower and middle schools
are disproportionately responsive to the subsidy. Predominantly white and Asian schools, rural
schools and high schools show less sensitivity to the subsidy rates.
Despite the noticeable impact on the expansion of the Internet, however, there is very
little evidence that the program has had any measurable outcome on student achievement, thus
far, as measured by test scores in a variety of subjects.
