    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper analyzes  weekly scanner data  collected for 108 groups at the county level  between 2006 and 2014. The data display multi-dimensional  weekly seasonal effects that are not exactly periodic but are cross-sectionally dependent.  Existing univariate procedures are imperfect and yield adjusted series that continue to display strong seasonality upon aggregation. We suggest augmenting the univariate adjustments with a  panel  data step that pools information across counties. Machine learning tools are then used to remove the within-year seasonal variations. A demand analysis of the  adjusted budget shares finds  three factors: one that is trending, and  two cyclical ones that are  well aligned with the level and change in consumer confidence. The effects of the Great Recession vary across  locations and product groups,  with  consumers  substituting towards home cooking away from non-essential goods. The adjusted data also reveal changes in spending to unanticipated shocks at the local level. The data are thus  informative about both local and aggregate economic conditions once the seasonal effects are removed. The two-step methodology  can be adapted to remove other types of nuisance variations provided that these variations  are cross-sectionally dependent.\n\n",
