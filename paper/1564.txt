Adjusting Output and Productivity
Indexes for Changes in
the Terms of Trade

ABSTRACT

In this paper we employ index number theory in addressing the problem of
adjusting real national income and real domestic product for changes in a

country's terms of trade. More specifically, using recent developments in the
theory of production, we address the problems related to measuring: Ci)

real

output produced and real input utilized by the private business sector;
(ii) productivity growth or technical change; (iii) the effects on domestic real

output of changes in the terms of trade; and (iv) the impact on final sales to
domestic purchasers of changes in the balance of payments deficit, in a
consistent accounting framework.
This treatment of international trade allows us to undertake comparative

statics analyses using only production theory, whereas in the traditional
paradigm which treats traded goods as perfectly substitutable with a class of

domestic goods, a general equilibrium framework is required. We illustrate our
suggested solutions using U.S. data for the years 1968—82.

Adjusting Output and Productivity Indexes for Changes in the Terms of Trade
W. Erwin Diewert

Catherine J. Morrison

1. Introduction
For many years, natinal income accountants have attempted to
measure the effects of terms of trade changes on national welfare. More
recently, the terms of trade1 adjustment issue has been approached from the
viewpoint of economic theory- and welfare economics by Svenson and Eazin
[19831, Lloyd and Schweinberger 119831, Greenlees and Zieschang t1981], and

Hamada and Iwata [198111. These authors treat the terms of trade adjustment
issue by considering the effects on a single consumer or by using a community

utility function. Both of these approaches involve difficult problems of
aggregation over consumers.

Our alternative approach to the measurement of the impact of terms of
trade changes is to consider the problem from the point of view of the producer.
In this alternative approach, our objective function becomes real output

rather than welfare. We assume that exports and imports flow through the
production sector and we show that an increase in the price of exports relative to imports has an effect that is similar to an increase in total factor
productivity.

More specifically, using recent developments in the theory- of

production,2 we address the problems related to measuring: Ci) real output
produced and real input utilized by the private business sector; (ii) produc—

or

technical change; (iii) the effects on domestic real output

of changes in the terms of trade; and (iv) the impact on final sales to
domestic purchasers of changes in the balance of payments deficit in a con-

sistent accounting framework. We illustrate our suggested solutions using
U.S. data for the years 1968—82.
Our solution to the problem of measuring real output, real input,
productivity,
changes

and "welfare" (the combined effect of

technical change and

in the terms of trade) turns out to be numerically very close to the

"Divisia" measurement techniques pioneered by Jorgenson and Griliches t1967,
19721

and Christensen and Jorgenson t19701. Our translog approach however

allows

us to give very precise interpretations of our

indexes, including a

decomposition of the indexes into individual comparative static effects ——

or the prices of exports.

development

and empirical implementation of these indexes

requires recognition of three distinct classes of (net) outputs, and their
corresponding prices, produced by the private business sector: (i) sales to
domestic purchasers (consumption goods, investment goods, and sales to the
government sector); (ii) sales to foreign purchasers (commodity or merchandise
exports); and (iii) purchases of foreign inputs (commodity or merchandise

imports). We view foreign commodity trade as passing through the private production sector: all commodity exports are produced by the production sector and
all commodity imports enter the private production ;ector and are combined with
transportation, wholesaling, retailing and other inputs before being sold to
domestic purchasers.

—3—

This treatment of trade, following that of Burgess [19714], and Kohli

[1978], allows us to answer hypothetical questions about internationally traded

goods using only production theory, whereas in the traditional paradigm which
treats traded goods as perfectly substitutable with a class of domestic goods, a

general equilibrium framework is required. Consider a hypothetical increase in
the relative price of an exported good between periods t—l and t. If other factors remain constant, the econonny can divert resources from export production

toward domestic goods production and still maintain the previous balance of

trade deficit or surplus. Thus the effect of an increase in export price is
similar to an increase in total factor productivity; "welfare" increases here in
response to changes in trade flows rather than technical change, in the sense
that there is an increase in output producible with a given vector of inputs

because of an exogenous change. In reverse, if the price of an imported good
increases and domestic inputs remain constant, then in order to maintain a
balance of trade equilibrium the economr will have to devote more resources to

producing exports or cut back on imports. In either case domestic production
will have to decrease.

The extensive literature on the problems of adjusting real national
income and real domestic product for changes in a country's terms of trade3 does
not provide any persuasive solutions to the problem of measuring these impacts.
Our procedures, however, allow us to determine the size of the required decrease
(or increase in the export price case mentioned) using index number theory

analogous to the usual productivity measurement framework. Although this

approach deals only with the private production sector of the economy, this
restricted focus allows us to develop index number formulae which are firmly
based on production theory and thus which possess well—defined optimality
properties .

The paper proceeds as follows. In section 2 we outline the translog
approach to productivity indexes. Our end result is the same as that obtained
by Diewert [1980; 1493, but we now have a more satisfactory precise
interpretation

of

the productivity index. In section 3 we defIne translog

real product and real input indexes. Section 14 shows how the translog input,
output and productivity indexes may be decomposed into products of individual

translog price and quantity effects. These price and quantity effects provide
valuable comparative statics type information about the economy's product

function. In section 5 we outline the translog production function approach to
modeling the effects of changes in the prices of exports and imports and
define "welfare" indexes capturing the impacts of both technical change and

changes in the terms of trade. In section 6, we switch our focus from the
economy's private domestic product (which includes exports minus imports) to
the private production sector's sales to domestic purchasers (which excludes

exports minus imports). We rework our translog approach, replacing the
product function by the sales function. This allows consideration of the
deficit effect, which measures the impact on output produced for domestic

purchasers of changes in the economy's balance of trade deficit. In section
7, we outline an alternative nonparameteric approach to the measurement of
productivity and to the effects of changes in the terms of trade, which is

—5—

necessary if the private production sectorts balance of merchandise trade

surplus changes sign going from one period to the next. Finally, in section 8
we illustrate the theory using U.S. data, and in section 9 we provide

concluding remarks.

2. Transiog Productivity Indexes
Suppose that there are Nd domestic goods, N exported goods,
Nm imported goods (or N = Nd + N + Nm net outputs) produced and utilized by
the private production sector of an econorrr. Suppose in addition, that there

are M primary inputs. Denote the aggregate private production sector's set of
technologically feasible combinations of net outputs and primary inputs by rt,

a subset of N + M dimensional space. Thus if (y, v) crt, the N dimensional
(y1,...,y)T can be produced by the private

sional vector of net outputs y

production sector if producers can utilize the non—negative N dimensional vec-

tor of inputs v

(vl,....,vM)T >

If y > 0 (<0), then the th net out-

put is an output (input), netted over all producers in the private production
sector.

Define the economy's period t private gross domestic product func-

tion r product function gt in brief by:

Ci)

gt(py) E maxy{P : (y,v)crt}

where p

(p1, ...,

)T

>>

is a (hypothetical) positive vector of net out-

put prices that private producers face6 and v ) 0M is a non—negative vector of
primary inputs that are (hypothetically) available to producers during period

—6—

t.

Thus gt(p, v) is the maximum

value

of domestic outputs plus exports minus

imports (where these goods are priced out at the relevant prices p in the p
vector), given that the vector of primary inputs v is available7 and given the

period t aggregate technolor at set rt. We assume that the technolo&Y set
rt is a closed, convex cone, so that the aggregate technolor is subject to
constant returns to scale.8 In this case, gt(p, v) will be a convex and
linearly homogeneous function in p, and a concave, riondecreasing and linearly

homogenous function in v. In fact, under a few additional regularity conditions on rt, gt will completely characterize the technolor set rt, i.e.,
there is a duality between rt and gt•9
Let Pt >>

be the observed price vector for net outputs during

period t and let yt vt be the corresponding vectors of net outputs and primary inputs respectively for period t. If producers are competitively
profit maximizing during period t and the product function gt(p, v) is dif-

ferentiable at (t,yt), by Hotelling's Lemma we have the following
relationship between yt Pt and Vt:

(2)

yt = Vgt(p tt
,v

where Vgt

(agtIaPl,...,agtfapN)T denotes the vector of first order partial

derivatives of gt with respect to the components of p. Let w

denote the positive vector of input prices that producers

face during period t.-° Then by a shadow pricing result that may be found in
Diewert [l971; i)40]

we have the following relationship between wt, Pt and

where Vg is the gradient vector of g with respect to the components of v.
We are now ready to define a new family of theoretical productivity
indexes that is similar in spirit to the families of output price and output
quantity indexes defined by Fisher and Shell 11972] and Samuelson and Swamy

1l971.

Let p >>

be a reference primary input vector. Define the period t theoretical
productivity Index depending on p, v by:

R (p,v) = g (p,v)/g
(p,v).
Using definition (1), we see that Rt(pv) is the percentage

increase in output (valued at the reference prices p) that can be produced by
the period t technology set compared to the period t—1 technology set, given
that in both cases the private production economy is utilizing the reference

primary input vector v. Thus there are an infinite number of theoretical productivity Indexes of the form defined by (4):

one for each reference price

thing to note about definition (7) is that we allow all of the first order

parameters of gt to depend on t; only the second order parameters (the au,

8ij and mm) are restricted to be constant over time. Another important point
to note is that gt defined by (7) can approximate an arbitrary twice con—

tinuously differentiable function to the second order. Hence there is pro—

that the private product function of our economy under consideration can be
adequately represented by the gt defined by (T).

Note that the right hand side of (8) can be evaluated given just

(pt_1,pt,yt_1,yt)/Q(wt_l,wt,vt_l,vt).

The rather remarkable result, (8) or (9), may be derived in an
alternative fashion using the quadratic leimna in the presence of discrete
variables developed by Denny and Fuss 11983a1 11983b] •114

Alternative approaches to the measurement of productivity- based on

the Malmquist l953] — Hicks 11981; 256] efficiency- index idea may be found in
Caves, Christensen and Diewert 11982; 110l_8] and Diewert 11983; 1077—831.

3. Translog Real Product and Real Input Indexes
The translog productivity index, (8) or (9), is consistent with tra-

ditional concepts of productivity growth measurement; i.e., %/Q0 represents
the growth in output independent of input growth, or "pure" technical change.
The next step is to consider the definitions and interpretation of the com—

—11—

ponent indexes of (RRt)3./2=Rt the translog (or Divisia) output or product and
input quantity indexes

and Q0.

To define real (i.e., deflated) product, we shall first define an
output price deflator. We follow the example of Fisher and Shell 11972],
Samuelson and Swamy 119714; 588—92] and Dlewert 11983; 10551 and define

the private business sector's theoretical output price index between periods

are the observed positive (net) price vectors

for periods t and t—1 respectively. Thus P(pt_1,pt,vt_l,t_l) =

gt_l(pt,vt_l)/gt_l(pt_l,vt_l)

is the proportional increase in period t—1

nominal product if prices of net outputs were changed from period t—1 prices

to period t prices, but the technolor and primary input vectors were held
constant at their period t—1 levels. This special case of (io) (and one other)
will be of particular interest:

techno1or set and quantities.
The following theorem shows that we can calculate the geometric

using observable data under some relatively unrestrictive

conditions.

Theorem 2 (Dievert [1983; 10621):

The above theorem suggests that the empirically calculable trarislog

price index p(ptlptytlyt) is an appropriate output price deflator
between periods t—1 and t. We suggest that a good measure of real product
growth between period t—1 and t is the corresponding translog implicit quandefined by:

To summarize, we suggest that the private production sector's output
price deflator should be defined by (12), the corresponding real product index
by (13), the real input index by (i6) and the corresponding input price defla-

tor by (17). The result indexes preserve account identities so that the value
of inputs will equal the value of outputs in each period. The output price
deflator and the input quantity index have nice economic interpretations in

terms of theoretical indexes. Finally, If the above system of accounting Is
followed, our preferred productivity index defined by (9) in the previous section is simply the ratio of our suggested real product and real input indexes,

primary input availabilities and also holding the technology constant at the
period t—]. or period t level.

The following counterpart to Theorem 2 (which may be proven in the
same manner) shows that we can calculate the geometric mean of the Laspeyres

and Paasche price effects for good n using observable price and quantity data
for periods t—l and t.

Theorem b:

Suppose gt and gt_l have the translog functional form as in (7) and
there is competitive profit maximizing behavior in each period. Then for nl,

Note that the product of the b equals the aggregate output price

b = b = (tltt1t) = (tt)1/2

Thus we may decompose the aggregate price change going from period t—1 to t
into a product of individual price changes.

Thus we may decompose the aggregate quantity change going from period t—l to t

into a product of individual quantity changes or effects. Furthermore,
referring back to (8), we see that the theoretical productivity index (RtRt)ht2
may be written as the nominal product ratio pt.yt/pt•'l.ytl divided by the
product of the price effects and quantity effects.
Note that Theorems 1 and 5 may be interpreted as (global) corn—

'parative statics theorems about the private product functions gt_l(p,v) and
t
g (p,v).

5. The Translog Product Function Approach to Changes in the Terms of Trade
We are finally ready to attack the problem of measuring the effects
of changes in prices of imported and exported goods on the output of the pri-

vate business sector of an econonr. A possible obvious approach to this
problem is to treat changes in the prices of traded goods using the output price

effects defined in the previous section. However, it seems useful to define
combination theoretical indexes that include the effects of changes in the prices of all internationally traded goods and then see if we can measure special
cases of these theoretical indexes with observable price and quantity data.

Recall that at the beginning of section 2, we stated that there were

Nd domestic goods, N exported goods and N imported goods for the private
production sector. We now partition our old output price and quantity vectors, Pt and y, into three subvectors of the appropriate dimensions; i.e.,
taking transposes, we have

The proof of this theorem follows along the lines of Theorem 3. Our
empirically implementable terms of trade adjustment index, d/e, turns out to
be (roughly speaking) an index of export prices divided by an index of import

prices. The indexes are not quite conventional indexes since the weights,

Our adjustment index d/e provides a very pre-

cise answer to a question which has intrigued national income accountants for
50 years.

The careful reader will be able to show that d/e is also equal to a

product of our old output price effects b defined below (19), where the product Is taken over all internationally traded goods.

Suppose we wish to measure the combined effects of technical
progress and improvements in the terms of trade, holding all domestic inputs

fixed. Such an index might be termed an (output) "welfare" change index.
Consider the following family of such indexes:

The following counterpart of Theorem 1 shows that we may calculate
the geometric mean of the Laspeyres and Paasche private product welfare
indexes using observable data.

Theorem 1: Suppose the product functions gt and gt_l have the translog functional form as in (7)

and there is competitive profit maximizing behavior in

each period. Then

(28)

where

(ww)"2 = (a/bc)(d/e)

=

(4R)hI'2(A4)/2

a, b and c are defined below (8) and d and e are defined below (25).

Thus the "welfare" change index on the left hand side of (28) is

equal to the product of our earlier productivity index (RRt)l!2 times our
terms of trade adjustment factor (A4)4l'2.
Unfortunately,

formula (25) is not the end of the story. There are

two conceptual problems with the product terms of trade adjustment indexes
defined by (214):

(1) since the value of exports minus the value of imports is

part of the private business product, the theoretical adjustment indexes do

—21—

not isolate the change in domestic production dd that could be attributed
to changes in export and import prices and (ii) the theoretical indexes
defined by (21) do not impose a balance of payments constraint on the private

business economy. Thus in the following sections, we take an alternative
approach to measuring the effects of changes in the prices of internationally
traded goods on domestic production which allows us to consider these problems.

6.

The Translog Sales Function Approach to Changes in the Terms of Trade

We call s the domestic sales function for the period t technolor
set rt. Besides its dependence on rt, 5t

depends on five sets of variables:

a positive vector of Nd domestic commodity prices; (ii) p, a positive

vector of N export prices that private domestic producers face (in terms of
domestic currency),1? (iii) p, a positive vector of Nm import prices that private domestic producers face (in terms of domestic currency),18 (iv) v, a posi-

tive vector of M quantities of primary inputs that are available to the
private production sector, and (v) a scalar v0, a bypothetical balance of
merchandise trade deficit that the private production sector is allowed to

run. If v0 <

0,

then —v0 is the trade surplus that the private production

sector must produce. The sales function st(pd,px,p ,v,v0) tells us how
much doiestic output the period t economy can produce (valued at the reference

available, exports

be sold at prices p, imports may be purchased at prices m and the

private production sector is allowed to utilize a balance of trade deficit

of size v0. The sales function is the producer theory counterpart to
Woodland's [1980] indirect trade utility function.19
Define the private production sector's period t (net) deficit
(surplus if negative) on merchandise trade by

addition to the above assumptions, we assume that s is differen—

is evident from (31) and (32) that the deficit v0 plays a role

which is similar to the role of a primary input: a bigger deficit (holding
other things constant) will lead to a bigger equilibrium value of domestic

sales. Note that the price of the deficit variable is 1, the exchange rate.

our old domestic product function. Thus instead of measuring the effects

of technical progress and changes in foreign prices on gross domestic private

product, we now want to measure the effects on gross private sales. Since this
is the itput. which actually gets Into the hands of domestic purchasers, for
short term "welfare" change measurement the sales concept may be more relevant
than the product concept.

Comparing our new empirically implementable productivity index
defined by the right hand side of (314) with our old productivity index defined

by (8), we see that if the deficits v and v' are small, then p'y will be
close to pt.yt =

wtv

and the term c0 will be close to one, and hence the two

productivity indexes will be very close to each other.

If v' and v are both negative, then formula (314) is still valid
if we cancel out the minus signs in £n(v0/v0

)

before

taking the logarithm.

However, if v1 and v are of opposite sign, then we cannot derive (314). We

will

deal with this opposite sign case in the following section.
Turning now to the price and quantity effects defined in section 14,

we may define analogous Laspeyres and Paasche price effects using the sales

Note the close resemblance of (1414) to (25). As usual, if the def 1—

index d*/e* will be numerically close to our old index d/e.

Suppose, as in section 5, that we wish to measure the combined
effects of technical progress and improvements in the terms of trade on

domestic sales. Pwo "welfare" indexes which measure these combined effects
are:

defined by (15) capture the combined comparative

and the balance of trade deficit. However, we may want our "welfare" index to
also capture the effects of a change in the balance of trade deficit; if the
deficit increases, there will be an "exogenous" increase in domestic sales
that

is in some respects similar to a short run increase in total factor

productivity.

Thus we define the following theoretical "total welfare" change

indexes which incorporate the effects of changes in total factor productivity,
prices of exports and imports, and changes in the deficit:

Various other decompositions and interpretations of (TL T )

are

The material presented in this section has been contingent on the
assumption that the balance of trade deficits have the same sign

in adjacent

periods. Our translog approach fails if this condition is not satisfied, since

c is not defined in this case. Empirically, we find that V0

does

change

sign. What then should we do? We address this question in the following section.

—31—

7.

The First Order Approximation Approach
The translog approach to modelling the sales function fails when V0 changes

sign going from period t—l to period t. In this section, we outline an
alternative nonparametric approach to modelling the sales function (which
perhaps has a more general validity) which does not fail if V0 changes sign.

The basic idea can be explained rather easily. From (32), we can evaluate
the first derivatives of the sales function s at the period t data point.
Hence we can form first order approximations to the two special cases of the
various theoretical indexes that always were of interest In the translog

approach. We then take the geometric mean of our two linear approximations.
The quadratic approximation lenitna of Denny and Fuss 11983a1 [1983b] leads us to

believe that our mean index Is accurate to the second order.

Let us apply the

The proof of the above theorem is by computation. The theorem is similar
to results in Diewert [19781 [1983;1099] 23

If we use the chain principle to construct our index numbers in an
empirical application rather than the fixed base principle, changes in prices

—35—

and quantities will be relatively small going from period to period. Hence, by
Theorem l, the translog indexes defined in the previous section will
approximate very closely the nonparameteric indexes defined in this section.
The advantage of the translog indexes is that they are exact for a translog
sales function which can approximate any sales function to the second order.
The nonparameteric indexes have only a formal first order approximation property
in terms of approximating an arbitrary sales function, but they numerically
approximate the translog indexes to the second order, and hence have an indirect
second order approximation property. Moreover, the nonparaxneteric indexes have
a practical advantage over the translog indexes: they are well defined even if
the balance of trade deficit changes sign going from one period to the next.
We turn now to an empirical application of the index number theory presented above.

8. Empirical Illustration
Empirical implementation of the theoretical structure outlined in the
previous section requires straightforward calculation of a number of translog

or Trnqvist indexes of output, inputs and trade, and combination of these
components into the composite productivity or welfare indexes. We have
computed these indexes for the United States to illustrate their use for
assessing the effects of international interdependence on national economic

Income and Product Accounts, (u.s. Department of Commerce [1981],

1982), [1983]), and have used real capital stock data constructed by the

Bureau of Labor Statistics (u.s. Department of Labor [19831) and real labor
data updated form Jorgenson and Fraumeni [1981], since these series closely
approximate our theoretically- ideal indexes.

for nine different types of exports and ten types of imports were available,

which were used to compute chain price indexes. For 1960—67, however, only
only two components were available; durable and nondurable goods. In this
section, the shorter time period was used. For purposes of comparison,
however, indexes for 1960—82 were computed and the resulting indexes are presented in the Appendix.

8.b. Empirical Implementation and Results
The first indexes to consider are those based on the product function

given by (1), hereafter denoted the product approach. Recall that the pure
theoretical productivity index Rt(pv) represented by (b) captures only
changes in technolor between two periods holding all other arguments of g('),
including input levels, constant. Rt is measured as a translog or T6rnqvist

implicit output index Q =

a/b

divided by a direct translog input index

=

from (8). For empirical implementation, a is calculated directly as the ratio

tt t—lt—l
Y

of the value of output p y / P

and b Is calculated as a translog price

index of output, where the output identity ptyt =

ptyt

+

ptyt

explicitly recognized. Using (13), the implicit output index

as a/b. The input index,

=

c,

—

ptyt

is calculated

in turn, is calculated directly as a translog

quantity index of K and L.

The resulting productivity growth measure (R,R)1'2 = a/bc and its
multiplicative components a, 1/b, and 1/c are presented in Table 1. Note

—3R.-

that this multifactor productivity index captures large drops in productivity

in 1970, 1975, 1979—80, and especially 1982. 1975 and 1976 were poor
productivity years ——

there

was a 2% drop in productivity —— which caused

concern in the late 70's about the observed "productivity slowdown". However,
the late 1960's were also disappointing and 1977 appeared very strong in terms
of productivity growth, indicating that productivity trends cannot be charac-

'

terized by a unique productivity downturn in 1973. In addition, 1980 exhibited

This suggests a trend toward deterioration of productivity

growth over time, much of which can be attributed to output fluctuations
represented by a/b.

To incorporate the effects on U.S. "welfare" of changes in the terms of
trade in addition to changes in technical efficiency, the adjustment index
(44)11112 =

d/e must be calculated. Using (25), d/e is computed empirically as

the product of the components of export and import price effects.
The translog adjustment index At for the product approach is reported in

Table 1. The index is generally close to 1.0, since internationally traded
goods are such a small proportion of total output, even in the most recent
years of the sample.

However, in l97l and 1980 (two enerr shock years),

increases in the prices of imported goods relative to exported goods were

responsible for declines in real output of about 1 1/2% in each year. With

the exception of these two years, the "welfare" index W, obtained by
multiplying Rt and At, does not vary significantly from Rt; for a
relatively closed econorrr like the U.S., improvements in the terms of trade

have a relatively small effect on economic welfare defined in this manner.

The second approach to measurement of productivity change and the effects
of international trade, the "sales—approach" can also easily be implemented
empirically.

Recall that using this approach it is possible to determine

the impact of changes in the deficit v =

The productivity

t 1/2 = R

measure corresponding to this approach is (R R )

listed in the second

part of Table 1. The components of this measure are also reported; a*, l/b* and
l/c* are computed as before except that the indexes are weighted by the value of

sales. The deficit component c is defined below (3i) for all periods where the
deficit did not change sign. For the five periods where the deficit did change

sign,c is undefined and so are the corresponding entries for 1/c,

can be adjusted by A = d /e defined similarly to d/e above (but

W. The sales approach, however, allows us also to consider the deficit effect

c0. The impact of

this effect was small,

with the exception of the year 1977,

where the increase in the trade deficit relative to 1976 was large enough to
account for an approximate 1.6% drop in real output.
In Table 2, we present productivity, adjustment and welfare indexes for
the translog product and sales approaches discussed above as well as the first

order approximations to the sales approach measures, ,

evident from the Table that the approximations closely correspond to the
appropriate translog sales approach indexes for the years where the deficit does

Finally, we summarize some of the information contained in these indexes

by average annual growth rates over selected periods in Table 3. The first
two periods to consider represent pre and post OPEC time periods 1968—73

and 1973_77.25 Note that these trends are measured between peak productivity
growth years. We also consider growth rates to the end of the sample period;
growth rates were calculated both to 1981 and 1982 for comparison since the
1982 values pull the trend downward so dramatically.

The overall productivity picture that emerges from these measures is

one of cyclical but secularly decreasing productivity growth. There is
clearly no unique productivity growth drop post—1973. Consider the pure
productivity growth measure based on the product approach,

The average

annual growth rate from 1968 to 1982 is negative; productivity appeared to

decrease by .1% per year. The breakdown into time periods, however, indicates

that this is caused by the last years of the sample. Productivity was
observed to grow by .8%/annum from 1968—73 and .7% from 1973 to 1977 ——

not

a large drop. By contrast, productivity declined by almost .7% over the last
time periods, 1977 to 1982.

Much of this observed drop is due to the 1982 data. If the growth trend is
measured from 1968 to 1981, the average annual growth rate is .3%. This also
causes the post—1977 growth rate to appear much higher; for this period
productivity growth per year is measured as .5%, a drop from the earlier years
but not a substantial drop.

The trends calculated from the

index, the product approach measure

adjusted for terms of trade, are lower than those without consideration of

changes from changes in the terms of trade. This is largely a

result of the large increases in import prices from the oil shocks —— much of

the observed decline is post—1973. This is consistent with the 1ypothesis that
with an increase in import prices relative to export prices, to maintain the

same deficit the economy must have less production; an increase in p relative

to p Is analogous to a decrease in total factor productivity. The relative
growth rates between time periods are, however, similar to the unadjusted
+

measure R .
The growth rates calculated from the approximation Indexes

and

based on the sales approach are very similar to those calculated from Rt

and W. This is as expected since they are measuring the same phenomena, they
are just based on slightly different approximation assumptions. Using this
approach, however, we may also consider the deficit effect represented by the

index. Recall that this index reflects exogenous changes in domestic sales
from an increase in the deficit that increases "welfare" similarly to short

run increases in total factor productivity. It is clear from a comparison

of

to

that total welfare growth including the deficit effect

is higher than that recognizing only the impact of the terms of trade.
even appears relatively higher in 1977 and 1982 than does the pure
productivity measure B •

Note also that the growth rate of B and T between

1973 and 1977 is the same. This is, however, a coincidence; the composition
of the productivity growth rate over the period is quite

different.

It appears, therefore, that adjustments of U.S. productivity measures for
terms of trade and deficit effects do not have a substantial Impact on

2—

trends in productivity. They do not, for example, provide a useful rationale
for the "productivity slowdown" through the late 1970's and especially the early

1980's. The small effect of trade adjustments is likely the result of the
small proportion of international trade carried out in the U.S. relative to

total national income. These procedures do, however, provide us with a way to
incorporate and assess the effects of international trade flows in our
measurement of national real output.

9. Concluding Remarks
This paper has focussed on defining index numbers for productivity and
"welfare" which are well defined for discrete data, based on production theory,
empirically irnplementable, and decomposable to obtain directly interpretable

effects of individual exogenous changes such as changes in technical change

and the terms of trade. Using our framework, the effect on welfare of changes
in terms of trade can explicitly be developed as analogous to technical change
or total factor productivity changes.

We have shown that the translog approach to generating these index
numbers results in empirical indexes that are geometric means of hypothetical

(unobservable) theoretical indexes. From these empirical indexes we have seen
that adjustments to traditional productivity indexes to generate welfare
indexes reflecting changes in terms of trade do not substantially change the

observed pattern of productivity growth for the United States. We found
slightly less growth of total welfare than productivity, resulting mainly from
an adverse terms of trade effect but attenuated somewhat by the deficit

effect. We would, however, expect the effects to be larger for an econonj for
which imports and exports were a larger portion of total sales.

export prices divided by

an

index of import prices (or the reciprocal of the

above).

4• Our approach is closest in spirit to the work of Gollop 11982].

Unfortunately, he did not distinguish between export prices and prices of
domestic commodities, so he could not address the terms of trade adjustment
issue.

6. Conceptually, these are before consumer tax but after government
subsidy prices. If there are taxes on intermediate inputs, then in theory we
should distinguish the total production of the good by the originating

industry and the total input utilization of the good by other industries. In
the latter case, the relevant price is the originating industry price plus the
per unit tax on the intermediate good that the using industries must pay.

Transportation inputs create similar theoretical complications.

7. Primary inputs consist of different grades of labor, capital,
inventories, land and other natural resources.

8. Some parts of our growth accounting methodology can be adapted
to deal with Increasing returns to scale technologies as In Denny, Fuss and
May 11981] or Caves, Christensen and Diewert 11982], but then exogenous

(econometric) estimates of the degree of returns to scale are required. In
this paper, we want our growth accounting methodology to depend only on observable prices and quantities.

9. The product function gt was introduced to the economics literature by Samuelson 11953] for the case of sectoral production functions with no

joint or intermediate production. In the general case, gt was defined by
Gorman 11968]. Complete duality theorems between gt and rt
by Diewert 119731

were

established

and McFadden 11978].

10. Thus wage rates should include all taxes and fringe benefit
components, capital Input prices should be ex post user costs of the type
constructed by Christensen and Jorgenson 119701, and land user costs should
include property taxes.

11. See also Samuelson [1953; 201 and Gorman 11968; 1531.

12. These conditions may be found in Diewert [1971; 139]. The
translog functional form is due to Christensen, Jorgenson and Lau 119711; the
translog product function defined by (7) is due to Diewert 119714] and Russell

—15—

and Boyce 119714].
13. Recall that if good n is an import good, then

and y will

be negative and the (p/p') term in b will be raised to a negative power.
Thus the output price index b is essentially a price index of domestic outputs

and exports divided by a price index of imports. We follow Jorgenson and
Nishimizu 119781 in calling b a translog price index rather than a Tornqvist
index.

lb. Denny and Fuss 11983b; 3181 also show why a suitable average of
first order approximations yields a second order approximation. Their result
may provide an intuitive explanation for (8), which essentially says that a
certain theoretical index may 1e approximated to the second order using only
first order information.

15. The proof of Theorem 2 is analogous to the proof of Theorem 3.

16. Diewert [1983; 1086] called this function the period t balance
of trade restricted value added function. A similar function was defined by
Archibald 11977; 60—61].

17. Thus these prices should include any export subsidies.

18. Thus these prices should include any customs duties, taxes and
tariffs.

19. Note that st(pdppvv) regarded as a function of
and v has mathematical properties similar to those of gt(pv) while

regarded as a function of x' m and

has properties similar to those

possessed by an indirect utility function. Under our regularity conditions on
rt, s will be: (i) nondecreasing, concave and linearly homogeneous in v, v0,
(ii) nondecreasirig, convex and linearly homogenous in d' (iii) quasiconvex

and homogeneous of degree zero in p, m and v0, (iv) nondecreasthg in the
components of

and (v) nonincreasing in the components of

20. We also need to use our assumption that p and

are price

vectors denominated in units of domestic currency so that exchange rates are
unity.

21. The homogeneity and curvature properties of

will place

various restrictions on the parameters (which we will not write out here).
Throughout this section, we assume that the quadratic coefficients of the

various period specific translog sales functions s are constant, even though
some results (such as those in Theorems 9 and 10) can be derived under weaker
conditions (in the sense that some of the quadratic coefficients can depend on
time).

22. The term d*c/e* correspond to the translog terms of trade
adjustment fact or

defined in Diewert 11983; 10981.

23. Following the termino1oy introduced in Diewert 119781, we
might term the translog indexes to be superlative while the non—parametric
indexes are pseudosuperlative.

2I. The BLS labor quantity series is an unweighted manhours series
and hence is unsuitable for our purposes. We wish to thank Hike Harper at BLS

and Barbara Fraumeni for their help in providing the updated data series.

25. The time periods often considered in the literature include
also pre—1965 and 1965—T3 instead of 1968—73. To allow for a comparison of
the earlier years, productivity measures from the 1960—82 data are considered
in the Appendix.

Appendix
This appendix provides indexes analogous to Tables 2 and 3 but including

the years 1960—67. These indexes are based on less disaggregated data than
the indexes reported in the text; the export and import data include only two

components each, durables and nondurables. Therefore, for example, the impact
of petroleum price increases, which has an independent effect for the later
data sample, is muted.

In general the indexes here indicate similar trends, although the
productivity decline over time is more evident in these numbers because of the

availability of the earlier data. The growth rate of productivity in the
1960—65 period was 2% per year, much larger than for any period in the later
sample,

and the

1965—73

growth

rate was 1% per annum, compared to .8% when

considered only from 1968. The 1965—71 numbers are also provided here to
emphasize the existence of periods of large productivity declines before 1973,
although this is clearly not as disastrous as the average over the 1973—82
period; the 1982 6%

drop

in productivity tends to distort the picture when

presented as an average over time. Note, finally, that although the terms of
trade and deficit effects adjusted productivity in the same direction as for
the later period, earlier in the sample, the effects were not as substantial,
resulting in a larger slowdown in "welfare" over time than in productivity.
