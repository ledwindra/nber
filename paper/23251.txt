Globalization Policies and Israel’s Brain Drain
by
Assaf Razin
March 2017

Abstract
The paper links Israel’s brain drain to skill-based immigration policies, prevailing in the
advanced economies.

Economic basic principles imply that both low-skill and high-skill immigration enrich the
workforce, thereby allow for a more finely graded specialization that raises average productivity,
and living standards. Diverse workforces are likely to be more productive, especially in
industries where success depends on specific knowledge, such as computing, health care and
finance. By easing labor bottlenecks, migrants help to keep down prices of goods and services.
However, in the confines of the generous welfare state, low skill immigrants impose fiscal
burden on the native born. In contrast, high-skill immigrants help in relieving the burden. This is
the economic rationale behind skill-based immigration policies. The other side of the skill bias in
immigration policy is that the international migration of skilled workers (the so-called brain
drain) deprives the origin country from its scarce resource—human capital. In setting up a
migration policy, one is certainly concerned by the skill composition of immigrants is a crucial
factor. Naturally, highly- skilled immigrants are more attractive to the destination countries than

low-skilled, immigrants for a variety of reasons are. For instance, highly- skilled immigrants are
expected to pay more in taxes to the Fisc in excess of what the Fisc provides them with. In
addition, these immigrants are also expected to boost the technological edge of their destination
countries. In contrast, low-skilled immigrants tend to depress the low-skill wages of the nativeborn, and they are deemed to impose a burden on the fiscal system.
The skill composition of immigrants to OECD countries other than the US, Australia, Canada
and Ireland is skewed towards the low education group, thanks to the less rigorous screening of
immigration policies. Australia, Canada, and US high-skill biased policy is shown in Table 11.

Razin and Sadka (2014) argue that the differences between the U.S. and the EU relate to the
degree of fiscal and migration coordination among the member states of the economic unions (
EU vs US) and the difference in the aging of the population between them.

key

determinants of the skill composition of immigration to the advanced economies. Section 3

Israel’s top-talent drain.

1. Understanding the Essence of Skill-Based Immigration Policy

How does the size of the welfare state affect the skill composition of immigration? A more
generous welfare state is more attractive to low-skilled immigrants, known as the magnet effect
(Borjas 1999). This is a supply-side explanation for the different composition of immigrants in
the US and Europe. Europe, with its generous welfare states, is an attractive destination for lowskilled immigrants, but far less so for high-skilled immigrants who are likely to be net fiscal
contributors. Indeed, the demand for immigrants, however, goes in the opposite direction. A
more generous welfare state (particularly with an aging population) has financing needs that

individuals for the F1 (student) or J1 (exchange visitor) visas (see Kerr et al (2016)). While these
visas do not offer long-term employment, US firms often recruit graduates of US schools using
visas like the H-1B. An advantage of employment-based immigration- policy regime compared
to a points-based approach is that the job-market search process is more efficient in the former
case. The employer-employee match is guaranteed to connect the immigrant talent with a
productive and adequate job.

immigrants could fill. With high-skilled immigrants more likely to pay in rather than draw on the
welfare state, more generous welfare states are more inclined to try to attract high skilled.3
To highlight skill-migration demand side forces I present a minimalist model that features two
migration regimes: free-migration and policy-controlled migration regimes. In summary, the
policy-controlled migration regime leads to a positive effect of the welfare benefits on the skill
composition of migration rates, because voters will internalize the fact that skilled migrants will
be net contributors to the system (i.e., the fiscal burden effect), whereas unskilled migrants will
be net beneficiaries (i.e., the social magnet effect). Under the free-migration regime, unskilled
migrants will gravitate to a generous welfare state, while skilled migrants will be deterred.
I assume a Cobb–Douglas production function, with two labor inputs, skilled and
unskilled:

(1)
Here, Y is the GDP, A denotes a Hicks-neutral productivity parameter, and
labor of skill level i, where

denotes the input of

e, u for skilled and unskilled, respectively. Wages,

, are

competitive and equal to the marginal productivity of .
Aggregate labor supply, for skilled and unskilled workers, respectively, is given by

3

Why have European countries been unsuccessful in either encouraging high-skill immigration
or in limiting the size of their welfare state? Razin and Sadka (2014) take a page out of the vast
work on tax competition to provide insights. They argue that fiscal independence in a migration
union like Schengen leads to policy distortions. Schengen members do not fully internalize the
degree to which their generous welfare states attract immigrants, as the costs of immigration are
borne by the union as a whole. This the need for fiscal unity in a common immigration zone is
novel. See Ilzetzki (2016).

Here, denotes the individual labor supply, e denotes the share of native-born skilled workers in
the total native-born labor supply, σ denotes the share of skilled migrants in the total number of
migrants, μ denotes the total number of migrants, and is the labor supply of an individual with
skill level i, . The total population (N) is comprised of native-born workers (which is normalized
to 1) and migrants (μ).
We specify a simple welfare-state system, which levies a proportional labor income tax at the
rate τ, with the revenues redistributed equally to all residents, N, as social benefit per capita, b.
The social benefit captures not only a cash transfer but also outlays on public services, such as
education, health, and other provisions, which benefit all workers, regardless of their
contribution to the tax revenues.
The government budget constraint is therefore

Assume that the utility function for skill type i,

The host-country migration policy is to be determined by the median voter in the host country.
Let us assume that the policy decisions on the tax rate τ and the total volume of migration μ are
exogenous. We do this in order to focus the analysis on a single endogenous policy variable,
which is the skill composition of migrants (i.e., σ). Note that once σ, μ, and τ are determined,
then the social benefit per capita, b, is given by the government budget constraint. Thus, we
denote the social benefit per capita, b, as

, where the exogenous variable μ is suppressed.

The indirect utility of an individual with skill level i is given by

(10)
Differentiating the equation with respect to σ, and employing the envelope theorem, yields

(11)
Thus, a policy-induced change in the share of skilled migrants in the total number of migrants, σ,
affects the utility level through two channels. First, an increase in σ raises average labor
productivity and thereby tax revenues. This, in turn, raises the social benefit per capita, b.

Second, an increase in σ, which raises the supply of skilled labor relative to the supply of
unskilled labor, depresses the skill premium in the labor market. If the decisive voter is unskilled,
both of the above effects increase his utility. Thus, an unskilled voter would like to set the skill
composition of migrants at the maximal limit,

. This means that the share of skilled

migrants preferred by the decisive skilled voter is typically lower than that preferred by the
decisive unskilled voter. The decisive skilled voter would like to set σ below 1 (which is
equivalent to assuming that the first-order condition is met before σ reaches 1).
Let superscript i denote the choice of the skill mix of immigrants by a decisive voter i ; i = u, e.
Define

as the share of skilled immigrants most preferred by an individual with skill level
in the host country, we obtain

Recall that the purpose is to find the effect of the change in the generosity of the welfare state on
the migration policy concerning σ. The generosity of the welfare state, captured by the
magnitude of the social benefit per capita, b, depends positively on the tax rate, τ (we assume
that the economy is on the “correct side” of the Laffer curve). Thus, we examine the effect of an
increase in τ on the change in the skill composition of the migrants, σ. It can be shown that

This means that, if the decisive voter were an unskilled worker, an increase in the tax rate τ
would leave the skill migration policy unchanged, because it is always set at the maximum
possible limit. However, if the decisive voter is a skilled worker, an increase in the tax rate τ will
change the policy concerning the skill composition of migrants in the direction towards a larger

share of skilled migrants. The reason for this is that when the tax rate is higher, the redistribution
burden upon a skilled decisive voter increases. Allowing an additional skilled migrant can ease
this rise in the fiscal burden. Note also that the result applies to the skill mix of migration rates.

migrants less burdensome to the Fisc. At the same time the increase in productivity also raises
the efficiency gains, and mitigate the of the skill-labor wage, which makes the influx of skilled
migrants desirable.

2. Skill Composition of Immigration: Empirical Analysis
While immigration from poor countries often invokes images of large masses of unskilled
laborers, in reality it has been quite skill-intensive. The composition of immigrants into highincome countries, even if they originate from countries with lower income per person, tends to
be more concentrated among highly educated than among less educated, relative to the
population of the country of destination (see Peri (2016)).
The explanation for the concentration of rich-country immigrants among the highly educated is
the screening and selection migration policies by the destination countries.
In this context, Razin and Wahba (2015) researched two hypotheses associated with migration
skill mix: The fiscal burden hypothesis and the magnet hypothesis. The former asserts that under
host-country migration policy, the rise in the generosity of the welfare state will skew the skill
mix towards skilled migrants because they can ease fiscal burden. The second hypothesis asserts

that under free migration, would be low skilled migrants will be more attracted to the welfare
state so that a more generous welfare state will have its skill mix skewed towards the low skilled
migrants. Accordingly, they investigate the effect of welfare state generosity on the difference
between skilled and unskilled migration rates, and the role of mobility restriction in shaping this
effect. They utilize the free labor movement within the European Union plus Norway and
Switzerland (EUROPE) and the restricted movement from outside the EUROPE in order to
compare the free-migration regime to the controlled-migration regime. Using bilateral migration
movements, and splitting the sample among flows within EUROPE, and flows from outside
EUROPE, they identify the migration regime effect. In Table 2 the dependent variable is the
share of skilled migrants in the migrant population, and the main explanatory variable is
"benefits per capita" –a measure of the generosity of the welfare state. The hypothesis is that
under free migration the coefficient of this variable is negative whereas under controlled
migration coefficient of "benefits per capita multiplied by R" is positive. The indicator X is a
dummy variable: R=1, if migration is controlled, whereas R=0, if migration is free. Recall the bi
lateral migration flows within EUROPE are referred to as free migration, whereas bi lateral
migration flows where the SOURCE is outside and the DESTINATION is inside EUROPE are
referred to as controlled migration. Appendix 10A includes some robustness tests of the model.

In the regression analysis (see also the Appendix) Razin and Wahba (2015) control for
differences in educational quality and returns to skills in source and host countries, and for
endogeneity bias (by using instrumental variables). Overall, the fiscal burden and the magnet
hypotheses, tested with the coefficient of social benefit in the regressions, are statistically
significant.4 Therefore, regression findings yield support for the magnet hypothesis under the
free-migration regime, and to the fiscal burden hypothesis, under the restricted-migration regime.

3. Brain Drain: international comparison
Kerr et al (2016) observe that the number of migrants with a tertiary degree rose by nearly 130
percent from 1990 to 2010, while low-skill (primary educated) migrants increased by only 40
percent during that time. High-skilled migrants are departing from a broader range of countries
and heading to a narrower range of countries—in particular, to the United States, the United
Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.5 At the policy level, they compare the points-based skilled
migration regimes as historically implemented by Canada and Australia with the employmentbased policies used in the United States through visa-control mechanisms, like the H-1B visa
program. Because of the links of global migration flows to employment and higher education
opportunities, firms and universities also act as important conduits, making employment and
admission decisions that deeply affect the patterns of high-skilled mobility.

Gould and Moav (2007) focus on 28 countries, which represent the largest exporters of
immigrants to the United States. The sample includes mostly advanced economies. Table 2
shows that the average index of emigration, (i.e., the number of emigres per 10,000 residents) is
33.36, with the index for Israel being nearly three times as high: 95.51. Only two countries have
a higher index––Ireland (143.9) and Portugal (99.21). When examining the index for educated
émigrés, i.e., those with a college degree, the average index is 12.41 and Israel's index is more
than three times higher, 41.45. Using this index, Israel is now higher than Portugal and the gap
between Israel and Ireland (49.09) narrows considerably. (See Table 8.2).

Kerr et al (2015) give suggestive examples showing how global migration may be most pronounced for those at the
very outer tail of the talent distribution.

Table 3 presents international indicators selective indicators of Emigration to the US by
Education Attainment. Israel is ranked at the very top for college graduate emigres per 10000
residents to the US; with number of about 41; only Ireland with a number 49 is ranked above
Israel. South Korea, suffering also from brain drain, has only about 25 college graduate emigres
per 10000 of its residents.

4. Israel’s Brain Drain

US serves as a magnet for top scientific immigrants. US immigrants hold a disproportionate
share of jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) occupations in the United
States (see Hanson and Slaughter (2016)). Top talent drain from Israel is disproportionately high
among the high-end immigrants.
In general, the ratio of foreign scholars in America to scholars in the home country ranged from
1.3% in Spain to 4.3% in the Netherlands (Figure 1). At 12.2%, Canada was an outlier, though
this is much more of a two-way street than in any of the other cases. While Canada is an outlier,
Israeli scholars in America are in a class by themselves. The Israeli academics residing in the
States in 2003-2004 represented 24.9% of the entire senior staff in Israel’s academic institutions

Israel supply of high skill workers is unique. Today, Israel ranks third in the world in the number
of university graduates per capita, after the United States and the Netherlands. It possesses the
highest per capita number of scientists in the world, with 135 for every 10,000 citizens
(compared to 85 per 10,000 in the United States), and publishes the highest number of scientific
papers per capita. However, brain drain in academia is exceptionally high. Ban David (2008)
demonstrates how differences between universities are inducing a massive academic migration
from Israel to the United States. The magnitude of this scholarly brain drain is unparalleled in the
western world. (See Figures 1 and 2). European Commission (2003) reported that 73% of the
15,000 Europeans who studied for their PhD in the States between 1991 and 2000 plan to remain

in America. If Europeans are concerned about the migration of their academics to the States, then
Israelis should be nothing less than alarmed.

brain drain.
4. Conclusion
Even though the overall education attainment level of Israel (native born) labor force is highly
ranked currently, schooling gaps develop. Israel, currently, has below average school gap among
advanced economies. A test score of 4.686 compared to the group average 4.939. See Table 9.1.

Appendix A: Immigrant Skill Composition: Robustness Tests
Razin and Wahba (2015) utilize the free labor movement within the European Union plus
Norway and Switzerland (EUROPE) and the restricted movement from outside the EUROPE in
order to compare the free-migration regime to the controlled-migration regime. Using bilateral
migration movements, and splitting the sample among flows within EUROPE, and flows from
outside EUROPE, they identify in Table 1 the migration regime effect. Robustness tests are
shown in Tables A2-A4. The dependent variable is the share of skilled migrants in the migrant
population, and the main explanatory variable is "benefits per capita" –a measure of the
generosity of the welfare state. The hypothesis is that under free migration the coefficient of this
variable is negative whereas under controlled migration coefficient of "benefits per capita
multiplied by R" is positive. The indicator X is a dummy variable: R=1,

if migration is

controlled, whereas R=0, if migration is free. Recall the bi lateral migration flows within
EUROPE are referred to as free migration, whereas bilateral migration flows where the
SOURCE is outside and the DESTINATION is inside EUROPE are referred to as controlled
migration.

Notes: All the migration rates are adjusted for the quality of education by relative quality in
source to host, i.e. REQ = (EQs/EQh) , F=Free migration; R=Restricted migration. Instrumented
using legal origin dummies, and the interaction of legal origin dummies and R. Regressions
include real GDP per capita growth rate in host, log distance, dummy for same language in host

Table A2-A4 describe the skill mix-benefit correlations under various econometric
specifications. Overall, the fiscal burden and the magnet hypotheses, tested with the coefficient
of social benefit in the regressions, are statistically significant. Therefore, regression findings
yield support for the magnet hypothesis under the free-migration regime, and to the fiscal burden
hypothesis, under the restricted-migration regime. In the regression analysis Razin and Wahba
(2015) control for differences in educational quality and returns to skills in source and host
countries, and for endogeneity bias (by using instrumental variables).
