Cost-Benefit Analysis of Leaning Against the Wind

ABSTRACT
A simple and transparent framework for cost-benefit analysis of "leaning against the
wind" (LAW), that is, tighter monetary policy for financial-stability purposes, is presented. LAW
has obvious costs in the form of a weaker economy if no crisis occurs and possible benefits in the
form of a lower probability and smaller magnitude of (financial) crises. A second cost—less
obvious, overlooked by previous literature, but higher—is a weaker economy if a crisis occurs.
For representative empirical benchmark estimates and reasonable assumptions the result is that
the costs of LAW exceed the benefits by a substantial margin. The result is robust to alternative
assumptions and estimates. A higher probability, larger magnitude, or longer duration of crises—
typical consequences of ineffective macroprudential policy—all increase the margin of costs over
benefits. To overturn the result, policy-interest-rate effects on the probability and magnitude of
crises need to be more than 5–40 standard errors larger than the benchmark estimates.

Introduction

“Leaning against the wind” (of asset prices and credit booms) (LAW for short) here refers a
monetary policy that is somewhat tighter (that is, with a somewhat higher policy interest rate) than
what is consistent with flexible inflation targeting without taking any effects on financial stability
into account. LAW has obvious costs in terms of a weaker economy with higher unemployment and
lower inflation. It has been justified by possible benefits in the form of a lower probability or smaller
magnitude of future (financial) crisis (BIS (2014, 2016a), Olsen (2015), Sveriges Riksbank (2013)),
although, strikingly, without any credible numerical cost-benefit analysis (Allen et al. (2016)). This
paper provides a framework for such an analysis and benchmark numerical estimates of the costs
and benefits of LAW. The result is that the costs exceed the benefits by a substantial margin.
Extensive robustness tests indicate that this result is quite robust. For example, to overturn the
result, the effects of LAW on the probability or magnitude of a crisis need to be more than 5–40
standard errors larger than typical empirical estimates in the literature.
Regarding the costs of LAW, one obvious cost is a weaker economy if no crisis occurs. But
there is a second, less obvious but higher cost, overlooked by the previous literature but taken into
account in this paper. If a crisis occurs when the economy is weaker because of LAW, for a given
magnitude of a crisis the economy will be weaker also in the crisis. Thus, for a given magnitude of
a crisis the crisis loss level and the cost of a crisis will be higher with LAW than without.
Consider a simple example in terms of unemployment gaps: First, suppose that without LAW
the non-crisis unemployment gap is zero. Suppose that a crisis increases the unemployment gap by
5 percentage points (pp). Then the crisis unemployment gap is 0 + 5 = 5 pp. With a quadratic loss
function the non-crisis loss is 02 = 0, and the crisis loss is 52 = 25. The cost of a crisis, defined
as the crisis loss less the non-crisis loss, is 25 − 0 = 25.
Next, suppose that with LAW the non-crisis unemployment gap is 0.5 pp instead of 0. Then
the crisis unemployment gap is 0.5 + 5 = 5.5 pp instead of 5. The non-crisis loss is 0.52 = 0.25
instead of 0, and the crisis loss is 5.52 = 30.25 instead of 25. Then there are two costs of LAW.
The first is the non-crisis loss increase, 0.25 − 0 = 0.25. The second is the crisis loss increase,
30.25 − 25 = 5.25. It is the main cost of LAW. The cost of a crisis, the crisis loss less the non-crisis
loss, is 30.25 − 0.25 = 30 instead of 25. The cost of a crisis is higher with LAW than without. In
this example, the first cost of LAW is of the second order, whereas the second cost is of the first
order. It follows that, for a zero non-crisis unemployment gap, the marginal cost is zero for the

1

first cost of LAW but positive for the second cost. Overlooking the second cost misses that the
marginal cost of LAW is positive, not zero.
Regarding the possible benefits of LAW (lower probability and smaller magnitude of crises),
recent work has emphasized the role of credit growth and credit booms in predicting crises and their
magnitude (Borio and Drehmann (2009), Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012), Schularick and Taylor
(2012)). A possible channel for the benefits of LAW is then through an effect of the policy (interest)
rate on credit combined with an effect of credit on the probability and magnitude of a crisis. I will
use representative empirical estimates surveyed in IMF (2015) of these effects to provide numerical
estimates of the benefits of LAW, more precisely Sveriges Riksbank (2014a) estimates of the policyrate effect on debt, Schularick and Taylor (2012) (ST for short) estimates of effect of debt on the
probability of a crisis, and Flodén (2014) and Jordà et al. (2013) (JST for short) estimates of the
effect of debt on the magnitude of a crisis.
There are, however, at least three limitations of this channel for the benefits of LAW. First,
ST show that the probability of a crisis is correlated with lagged growth of real debt or of debt to
GDP. But if monetary policy is neutral and has no real effects in the long run, it does not affect
real debt or debt to GDP in the long run. Then lower real debt growth and a probability of a
crisis will be followed by higher real debt growth and probability of a crisis; the probability is just
shifted between periods. The cumulative policy-rate effect on the probability of a crisis and the
cumulative marginal benefit from a lower probability of a crisis will then be small or zero. If instead
monetary policy is non-neutral and the policy-rate has a permanent negative effect on real debt,
the cumulative policy-rate effect on the probability of a crisis will be negative and the cumulative
marginal benefit will be positive, stacking the cards in favor of LAW. Including this case is an
obvious robustness test, but as shown below, also for monetary non-neutrality the result is that
costs of LAW exceed the benefits by a substantial margin.
Second, as discussed in Svensson (2013a), the policy-rate effect on real debt and debt to GDP
is likely to be small and could be of either sign. The stock of nominal debt, especially mortgages
with long maturities, has considerable inertia. A higher policy rate may slow down the growth of
housing prices and of new mortgages, but only a fraction of the stock of mortgages is turned over or
each year. A higher policy rate also slows down the growth of the price level. Thus, both numerator
and denominator of real debt are affected in the same direction, making the policy-rate effect on
the ratio smaller and possibly of the opposite sign. This is even more the case for the debt-to-GDP
ratio (a stock divided by a flow) because then not only the price level but also real GDP enter in the
2

denominator. The policy-rate effect on the flow of nominal GDP may be larger and quicker than the
effect on the stock of nominal debt. Several recent papers have indeed found empirical support for a
higher policy-rate increasing rather than decreasing the debt-to-GDP ratio (Alpanda and Zubairy
(2014), Bauer and Granziera (2016), Gelain et al. (2015), and Robstad (2014)). Nevertheless, I will
use empirical estimates according to which the policy-rate has a negative effect on both real debt
and debt to GDP, thereby stacking the cards in favor of LAW.
Third, the correlation between the probability and magnitude of a crisis and previous growth of
real debt or debt to GDP is obviously a reduced-form result. The underlying determinants of the
probability and magnitude of a financial crisis are mainly the nature of the shocks to the financial
system and the resilience of the system. The latter depends in principle on the loss-absorbing
capacity and liquidity of lenders, intermediators, and borrowers and the debt-servicing capacity of
the borrowers. The extent to which higher debt growth increases the probability of a crisis depends
on to what extent it is “bad” credit growth due to, for example, lower lending standards, excessive
loan-to-value ratios, and speculation rather than “good” credit growth due to financial deepening,
new technology and investment opportunities, and other developments that do not weaken but
rather strengthens the financial system. With better data on the underlying determinants of the
nature and magnitude of shocks and the resilience of the system, it should be possible to assess
the probability and magnitude of a crisis with better precision. However, given the list of possible
underlying determinants, it seems that the policy rate is unlikely to have any systematic impact
on most or any of them, and that micro- and macroprudential policy is much more likely to have
such an impact.1
Some of the estimates, in particular of the policy-rate effects on debt growth and debt to GDP,
are imprecise, in the sense of having large standard errors relative to the point estimates and not
being significant. This makes the estimates of costs and benefits of LAW imprecise. A two-step
strategy is used to handle this. First, I choose benchmark point estimates of the effects that are
either representative or tilted in favor of LAW. The result for these benchmark estimates turn out
to be that costs exceed benefits by a large margin. Second, I examine how robust this result is to
1

Bordo and Meissner (2016), in a thorough survey the literature on financial crises, warns that “it is not at
all obvious from the historical record that credit-financed asset price boom-bust (i.e., what has come to be known
as the financial cycle) have always been, or will always be, the key explanation despite the recent emphasis on that
explanation.” IMF (2015) discusses the transmission channels from the policy rate to the probability of a crisis and
documents its complexity, uncertainty of direction, and variation over time. Dagher et al. (2016) shows that more but
still relatively moderate bank capital relative to risk-weighted assets could have had a dramatic effect in reducing the
frequency of banking crises in the OECD countries since 1970. Korinek and Simsek (2016) show that macroprudential
policies can be quite effective in dealing with excess household debt and that interest-rate policies are likely to be
inferior in this respect.

alternative assumptions about the components of the costs and benefits. In particular, I examine
how many standard errors larger than the benchmark estimates the effects need to be in order to
overturn the result, in the sense of at least reaching break-even, that is, when the costs and benefits
of LAW are equal. One might think that the number of standard errors needed would be relatively
small, perhaps even less than two, indicating a less than robust result. But the number of standard
errors required to reach break-even turns out to be relatively large, ranging from more than 5 to
about 40, indicating a quite robust result.
Related literature

The previous literature trying to quantify the costs and benefits of LAW

(including Ajello et al. (2016), Svensson (2014, 2015), and IMF (2015)) has mainly considered a
two-period setup where a higher policy rate has a cost in the first period in the form of higher
unemployment (and lower inflation) and a benefit in the second period in the form of a lower
probability of a crisis because of lower debt. By assumption there is no possibility of a crisis in
the first period, and by assumption a crisis in the second period would start from a steady state
with a zero non-crisis unemployment gap. The crisis unemployment gap and the crisis loss are
then assumed to be constant and independent of LAW. This setup disregards that a crisis could
come any time while the unemployment is higher due to LAW. It also assumes a fixed rather than
endogenous lag between LAW and lower probability of a crisis. Finally, it implicitly assumes that
monetary policy is non-neutral and has a permanent effect on real debt.2

3

Importantly, by assuming that the crisis loss is constant and independent of the non-crisis
unemployment gap, the previous literature disregards the second cost of LAW, the main cost of
LAW. In terms of the example above: Suppose again that with LAW the non-crisis unemployment
gap is 0.5 pp. In the present framework, the crisis unemployment gap, the crisis loss, and the crisis
loss increase are then, respectively, 5.5 pp, 5.52 = 30.25, and 30.25 − 25 = 5.25. In the previous
literature, they are instead always, respectively, 5 pp, 52 = 25, and 25 − 25 = 0, regardless of
the non-crisis unemployment gap. This means that in the previous literature the second cost of
LAW, the crisis loss increase, will be zero instead of positive. Then, with the first cost being of
second order, it follows that, for a zero non-crisis unemployment gap, the marginal cost of LAW
will be zero instead of positive. With a positive marginal benefit of LAW, some LAW will then be
optimal. But the optimal LAW is very small, corresponding to a policy-rate increase of only a few
2

Diaz Kalan et al. (2015) instead use a quarterly multi-period model where the probability of a crisis varies over
time and the costs and benefits of LAW are cumulated over time, as does this paper. They nevertheless still assume
that the crisis unemployment gap and the crisis loss level are constant and independent of LAW.

basis points (bp), and thus of no practical relevance, as shown by Ajello et al. (2016) and further
examined in Svensson (2017b).4
The assumption of a constant crisis loss has the counter-intuitive implication that the cost of a
crisis, the crisis loss less the non-crisis loss, is decreasing in the non-crisis loss. In particular, if the
non-crisis unemployment gap for some reason would be above 5 pp, the economy would be better
off in a crisis, because then the unemployment gap would drop to 5 pp. It trivially follows that the
cost of a crisis is lower with LAW than without, because LAW would increase the non-crisis loss
without affecting the crisis loss.
After the first version, Svensson (2016a), of this paper was distributed, BIS (2016a, Box IV.B)
has disputed its result and argued that it (1) relies on debt growth rather than a “financial cycle”
as a predictor of crises, (2) assumes that the magnitude of a crisis is exogenous and independent
of the policy rate, and (3) just discusses a one-off policy-rate increase instead of a systematic and
optimal policy of LAW.
Regarding (1), it is an empiricial issue what, first, the best predictor of future crises is and,
second, what the policy-rate effect on that predictor is. I use real debt growth because of the
empirical support of ST and IMF (2015). Nothing prevents the use of a financial cycle instead,
if it has better empirical support.

5

Regarding (2), an endogenous magnitude of a crisis was

actually included in Svensson (2016a, appendix D). As in this paper, it does not change the result.
Regarding (3), Svensson (2016a, section 3) actually examines optimal policy, not only a one-off
policy tightening.6 Interestingly, in their review of BIS research, Allen et al. (2016) criticize the
BIS for being “excessively focussed on building the case for LAW” and for too much research being
“motivated primarily by a desire to overturn [the Svensson (2016a)] conclusion on the inadvisability
of LAW.”
More recently, Filardo and Rungcharoenkitkul (2016) and Gourio et al. (2016) (FR and GKS for
short) have responded to Svensson (2016a), arguing that LAW would be optimal and maintaining
that this contradicts my result. However, as discussed in Svensson (2016b, 2017b), their results
can be explained by their assumption that the cost of a crisis is constant and independent of LAW.
In terms of the simple example above, FR and GKS can be interpreted as assuming that the
4

The reason for the small optimal LAW is that the marginal cost for the first cost of LAW rises quickly with the
non-crisis unemployment gap whereas the marginal benefit is flat and relatively small.
5
However, with the financial cycle as in Drehmann et al. (2012) including real debt and debt to GDP, by the
discussion above, the policy-rate effect on it is likely to be small and possibly even of the opposite sign. Consistent
with this, the policy-rate impact on the “leverage gap” in Juselius et al. (2016, table 3) is small and not statistically
significant.

unemployment gap is not affected by a crisis and that there is a separate constant cost of a crisis
(the crisis loss less the non-crisis loss) that is always 25, regardless of the non-crisis unemployment
gap. Then, without LAW, the non-crisis loss is zero and the crisis loss is 25. With LAW, the
non-crisis loss is 0.25, and the crisis loss is 0.25 + 25 = 25.25. The first cost of LAW, the non-crisis
loss increase, is 0.25 − 0 = 0.25. The second cost, the crisis loss increase, is 25.25 − 25 = 0.25, equal
to the first. Thus, although the second cost is not zero, as when a constant crisis loss is assumed,
it is as small as the first and thus of second order.
Their assumption then has the same implications as the assumption of a constant crisis loss.
For a zero non-crisis unemployment gap, the marginal cost of LAW is zero, whereas the marginal
benefit is positive. Some LAW is then optimal. But again, as shown in Svensson (2017b) and for a
constant crisis loss in Ajello et al. (2016), the optimal LAW is very small, only a few basis points.
Consistent with this, GKS find that the optimal LAW leads to a reduction of the annual probability
of only 6 bp from 2.08% to 2.02%, implying on average one crisis in 49.5 years instead of one in
48.1 years. This is hardly economically significant.7
Finallly, Adrian and Liang (2017) (AL for short) have challenged the robustness of my result
and argued that alternative reasonable assumptions about the effect of the policy rate on the
probability or magnitude of a crisis would overturn it. However, as is shown in Svensson (2017a)
and below, AL’s alternative assumptions required to overturn my result imply an effect of debt on
the magnitude of a crisis that is more than 40 standard errors larger than the estimate of Flodén
(2014) and more than 11 standard errors larger than an estimate that follows from JST, or an effect
of credit on the probability of a crisis that is more than 13 standard errors larger than the estimate
of ST.8
In summary, relative to the previous literature this paper takes into account the second cost of
LAW, the crisis loss increase. It also clarifies the role of monetary neutrality and non-neutrality.
7
As shown in Svensson (2017b), with the assumption of a constant cost of a crisis in the present framework, the
reduction in the annual probability of a crisis is 4 bp, quite similar to the GKS result. Furthermore, GKS assess
whether LAW is beneficial by examining whether the loss is reduced if an additional variable is added as an argument
to a Taylor-type rule, namely “inefficient credit,” which variable is assumed to affect the probability of a crisis. But
Taylor-type rules are suboptimal; they have too few arguments. Optimal policy normally requires responding to all
state variables, including shocks. Adding an argument to a suboptimal policy rule, as is common in many papers on
monetary policy, means that the set of arguments better span the space of state variables and shocks. It is therefore
not surprising if adding an argument, normally any argument correlated with left-out state variables, reduces loss.
8
Sutherland et al. (2012) and Mian et al. (2016) (cited by AL) examine and estimate the possible effect of credit
on the magnitude of downturns in recessions. But, importantly, the estimates that are relevant here are of the possible
effect of credit on the magnitude of a financial crisis, that is, the effect on the downturn conditional on a financial
crisis, not the possible effect of credit on the unconditional downturn in a general recession, regardless of whether
there is a financial crisis or not. In a similar line, Adrian and Duarte (2016) examine possible effects of the policy
rate on the volatility of GDP, regardless of whether there is a financial crisis or not. This is about a possible aspect
of the transmission mechanism that violates certainty equivalence, but this is a different issue from what is discussed
in this paper. Thus, in contrast to what they state, their findings do not contradict but are rather, as far as I can
see, orthogonal to the result in this paper.

6

In particular, it provides a simple, transparent, and robust framework for cost-benefit analysis of
LAW that only depends on a few assumptions and empirical estimates. It furthermore provides
several robustness tests, including some that handle imprecise estimates.

Section 2 lays out the theoretical framework, section 3 specifies benchmark estimates

and assumptions, section 4 provides robustness tests, and section 5 present conclusions and some
qualifications. Appendices A-D include some technical details.

Theoretical framework

This section sets up the theoretical framework used to assess the costs and benefits of LAW. Let
ut denote the unemployment rate in quarter t ≥ 1, and let u∗t denote the optimal unemployment
rate under flexible inflation targeting when the possibility of a financial crisis is disregarded. By
flexible inflation targeting I mean a monetary policy under which the central bank stabilizes both the
inflation rate around an inflation target and the unemployment rate around its long-run sustainable
rate. Exogenous cost-push shocks to the Phillips curve create a tradeoff between stabilizing the
inflation rate and stabilizing the unemployment rate. Then the optimal unemployment rate depends
on the cost-push shocks, and varies over time. It will here be called the benchmark unemployment
rate.
Let the unemployment deviation, ũt , be defined as the gap between the unemployment rate and
the benchmark unemployment rate, ũt ≡ ut − u∗t . Thus the unemployment deviation is not the
deviation from the steady state (or the unemployment gap as in the simple example in sectison 1)
but the devation from the optimal policy under flexible inflation targeting when the probability of
a crisis is set to zero. As explained in appendix A, the loss from the unemployment rate deviating
from the benchmark unemployment rate can be represented by the simple quadratic (indirect) loss
function,
Lt = (ũt )2 ,

(2.1)

where Lt denotes the quarter-t (simple) loss.9 The quarter-1 intertemporal loss function for monetary policy is
L1 = E1

∞
X

δ t−1 Lt =

t=1
9

∞
X

δ t−1 E1 Lt ,

t=1

The “true” loss function is then an affine function of the simple loss function.

7

(2.2)

where E1 denotes expectations conditional on information available in quarter 1, δ ∈ (0, 1) denotes
a discount factor, and E1 Lt denotes the expected quarter-t loss for t ≥ 1.
The expected quarter-t loss will be given by
E1 Lt = E1 (ũt )2 = (1 − pt )E1 (ũnt )2 + pt E1 (ũct )2 ≡ (1 − pt )E1 (ũnt )2 + pt E1 (ũnt + ∆ut )2 .

(2.3)

Here it is assumed that, in quarter t ≥ 2, there can be either of two states of the world, namely
either a non-crisis or a (financial) crisis, denoted n and c, respectively. By assumption, there is
no crisis in quarter 1. Furthermore, pt denotes the probability of (having) a crisis in quarter t,
conditional on information available in quarter 1. The variable ũnt denotes the quarter-t non-crisis
unemployment deviation, that is, the unemployment deviation if there is no crisis in the quarter.
Then the first term of the right side of (2.3) is the probability of no crisis, 1 − pt , times the expected
non-crisis loss, E1 Lnt = E1 (ũnt )2 , that is, the expected loss if there is no crisis in quarter t.
The second term on the right side of (2.3) is the probability of a crisis times the expected crisis
loss, E1 Lct = E1 (ũct ), that is, the expected loss if there is a crisis in quarter t. A crisis is assumed to
be associated with a (possibly random) crisis increase in the unemployment rate, ∆ut > 0, so the
crisis unemployment deviation is ũct ≡ ũnt +∆ut , and the crisis loss is Lct = E1 (ũct )2 ≡ E1 (ũnt +∆ut )2 .
This crisis increase in the unemployment rate is net of any policy response during a crisis. Thus,
∆ut can be interpreted as the unemployment-rate increase that is equivalent to the combination
of a demand shock and any shock to the transmission mechanism of monetary policy associated
with a crisis, net of the conventional and unconventional policy response at a crisis, including any
restriction on the policy response such as the lower bound of the policy rate. It represents the
magnitude of a crisis.10
Equation (2.3) can be written as 11
E1 Lt = E1 (ũnt )2 + pt [E1 (ũnt + ∆ut )2 − E1 (ũnt )2 ] = E1 (ũnt )2 + pt [E1 (∆ut )2 + 2E1 ũnt E1 ∆ut ]. (2.4)
Here, the expression in square brackets in (2.4) is the (expected) cost of a crisis, that is, the
(expected) crisis loss less the (expected) noncrisis loss. We see in the square brackets on the
10
The benchmark assumption is for simplicity that the benchmark unemployment rate, u∗t , is independent of
whether there is a crisis or not, in which case ∆ut is the crisis increase in the unemployment rate. As explained in
appendix B, if the benchmark unemployment rate is correlated with a crisis, the crisis increase in the unemployment
rate and in the unemployment deviation are not the same. Then ∆ut is the crisis increase in the unemployment
deviation and equals the crisis increase in the unemployment rate less the crisis increase in the benchmark unemployment rate. Because the benchmark unemployment rate is increasing in cost-push shocks to the Phillips curve and
such cost-push shocks are likely to be negative in a crisis, any crisis increase in the benchmark unemployment rate is
likely to be negative.
11
I assume that E1 (ũnt ∆ut ) = E1 ũnt E1 ∆ut , that is, ũnt and ∆ut are uncorrelated conditional on information
available in quarter 1.

right side of (2.4) that the (expected) cost of a crisis is increasing in the (expected) non-crisis
unemployment deviation, E1 ũnt . (For brevity and when no confusion need arise, “expected” will
often be left out but understood in the rest of the paper.)
As explained above, a zero non-crisis unemployment deviation corresponds to the optimal policy
under flexible inflation targeting when the possibility of a crisis is disregarded, that is, when the
probability of a crisis is set to zero. This can be seen as a policy of no leaning (NL for short).
A positive non-crisis unemployment deviation corresponds to tighter policy than NL and can thus
be seen as representing LAW. A negative non-crisis unemployment deviation corresponds to easier
policy than NL and can be seen as representing leaning with the wind (LWW for short).
Consider the effect on the intertemporal loss (2.2) of a policy tightening in the form of an
increase in the policy rate during quarters 1–4, denoted dī1 > 0. The cumulative net marginal cost
of LAW, NMC, is defined as the derivative of the intertemporal loss with respect to the policy rate

Furthermore, define the quarter-t net marginal cost, NMCt , as dE1 Lt /dī1 , the policy-rate effect

Here MCt denotes the marginal cost of LAW. It consists of the marginal increase in the expected quarter-t loss from an increase in the unemployment deviation at constant probability
and magnitude of a crisis. By (2.5) it equals two times the unemployment deviation (E1 ũt =
E1 ũnt + pt E1 ∆ut ) times the policy-rate effect on the non-crisis unemployment rate, which equals
the policy-rate effect on the unemployment deviation for constant probability and magnitude of a
crisis (dE1 [ũt |pt , E1 ∆ut = const.]/dī1 = dE1 ũnt /dī1 = dE1 unt /dī1 ).12
Furthermore, MBpt denotes the marginal benefit of LAW from a lower probability of a crisis. It
consists of the marginal reduction of the expected quarter-t loss from a lower probability of a crisis
12

I assume that E1 (ũt dunt /dī1 ) = E1 ũt dE1 unt /dī1 , that is, that ũt and dunt /dī1 are independent conditional on
information available in quarter 1. Furthermore, I have used that, because u∗t depends on cost-push shocks and is
exogenous, dE1 ũnt /dī1 = dE1 (unt − u∗t )/dī1 = dE1 unt /dī1 .

at a constant non-crisis unemployment deviation and a constant magnitude of a crisis. By (2.6)
it equals the crisis loss increase times the negative of the policy-rate effect on the probability of a
crisis.
Similarly, MB∆u
denotes the marginal benefit of LAW from a smaller magnitude of a crisis.

It consists of the marginal reduction of the expected quarter-t loss from a smaller magnitude of a
crisis at constant probability of a crisis and constant non-crisis unemployment deviation. By (2.7)
it equals two times the probability of a crisis times the crisis unemployment deviation times the
negative of the policy-rate effect on the magnitude of the crisis. MBt denotes the total marginal
benefit, the sum of the two components.

The case of exogenous probability and magnitude of a crisis: LWW! Assume now temporariliy that the probability and magnitude of a crisis are exogenous, in the sense that they cannot
be affected directly or indirectly by the policy rate and LAW. That is, dpt /dī1 ≡ dE1 ∆ut /dī1 ≡ 0
t
for all t ≥ 1. It then follows from (2.6) and (2.7) that MBpt ≡ MB∆u
≡ 0; there are no marginal
t

benefits of LAW, only the marginal cost, given by (2.5).
The optimal policy would then be, if possible, to set each expected future unemployment deviation equal to zero, E1 ũt = E1 unt + pt E1 ∆ut = 0, which by (2.5) would make each future marginal
cost equal to zero and minimize each quarter-t expected loss. But, for a positive future probability of a crisis, pt > 0, this implies setting the expected future non-crisis unemployment deviation
negative,
E1 unt = − pt E1 ∆ut < 0.
10

(2.13)

That is, if the probability and the magnitude of a crisis are exogenous, it is optimal to lean with
the wind, LWW, in the sense of setting a lower unemployment rate than the rate that is optimal
if the probability of a crisis is set to zero. If the probability and magnitude of a crisis are not
exogenous but can be affected by LAW, the issue is then whether any resulting marginal benefits of
lower probability or smaller magnitude of a crisis can be so high as to dominate over the marginal
cost and make LAW optimal instead of LWW.

3

Benchmark numbers

In order to asses whether or not the costs of LAW exceed the benefit, we need numerical estimates
of or assumptions about the components of the marginal cost and benefits in (2.9)-(2.11), that is,
pt , E1 ∆ut , dE1 unt /dī1 , E1 (∆ut )2 , dpt /dī1 , and dE1 ∆ut /dī1 .
The marginal cost of LAW

For a numerical estimate of the marginal cost of LAW, by (2.9) we

need representative estimates of or realistic assumptions about the probability of a crisis, the (expected) magnitude of a crisis, and the policy-rate effect on the (expected) non-crisis unemployment
rate.
As a representative benchmark policy-rate effect on the (expected) non-crisis unemployment rate,
dE1 unt /dī1 , I will use the impulse response of the Riksbank’s empirical DSGE model Ramses to a 1
pp higher policy rate during quarters 1–4, shown as the dashed red line in the lower right part of figure 3.1.13 The unemployment rate increases above the baseline to about 0.5 pp in quarters 6–8 and
then slowly falls back towards the baseline. For an initial zero non-crisis unemployment deviation,
the dashed red line then also shows the effect of the policy rate on the non-crisis unemployment
deviation.
This impulse response has a typical and realistic hump-shaped form. Because the economy
responds with a lag to policy-rate changes, the initial effect is approximately zero and the maximum
effect is reached after 6–8 quarters. It is similar in shape and magnitude to the impulse response
reported by IMF (2015, para. 40 and footnote 42) for its widely used GIMF model for an average
of a large, mostly closed economy and a small open economy. It is also similar in shape but larger
in magnitude than the impulse response of the unemployment rate for the U.S. reported in Stock
13
The figure shows the impulse response for 40 quarters of the unemployment rate that was reported by Riksbank
Deputy Governor Karolina Ekholm in Ekholm (2013). It is the same response as the one reported to alternative
policy-rate paths for quarters 1–12 in Sveriges Riksbank (2014b).

and marginal loss
For a zero non-crisis unemployment deviation, if a crisis occurs, the unemployment deviation would then increase to a crisis unemployment
deviation of 5 pp, illustrated by the solid black horizontal line in the upper right part of figure 3.1.
Furthermore, with LAW and a positive non-crisis unemployment deviation, if a crisis occurs, the
unemployment deviation would increase above 5 pp, as shown by the thick solid red line in the
figure. Importantly, LAW leads to a higher crisis unemployment deviation, not only to a higher
non-crisis unemployment deviation.
The dashed and solid blue lines in the left part of the figure show the loss and marginal loss
(with respect to the unemployment deviation), Lt = (ũt )2 and MLt ≡ dLt /dũt = 2 ũt , respectively,
measured along the horizontal line to the left of the origin. For a zero non-crisis unemployment
deviation, the marginal loss of increasing the non-crisis unemployment deviation is zero. At a
positive crisis unemployment deviation equal to ∆u = 5 pp, the marginal loss of increasing the
crisis unemployment deviation is not zero but positive, MLc = 2∆u = 10, as shown in the figure.
It follows that the marginal crisis loss with respect an increase in the policy rate, dLc /dī1 =
MLc dE1 uct /dī1 = 2∆u dE1 unt /dī1 is positive. When multiplied by the probability of a crisis, it
equals the marginal cost of LAW in (2.9).
It remains to specify the benchmark probability of a crisis, pt . I will assume that there is a
benchmark annual probability of a crisis start equal to 3.2%, corresponding to a crisis on average
14

It is natural that the policy-rate effect on the unemployment rate is larger in a small open economy, with a
strong exchange-rate channel in the transmission of monetary policy, than in a large relatively closed economy like
the U.S. Stock and Watson’s impulse response peaks at 0.2 pp at around 8 quarters, but the cumulative interest-rate
impulse is smaller than in figure 3.1. (In figure 3.1 there is an interest-rate impulse in all four quarters 1–4, in order
to hold the policy rate 1 pp higher than the baseline for the four quarters.) With a larger and similar cumulative
impulse response, Stock and Watson’s peak might be around 0.25–0.3 pp rather than of 0.2.

In figure 3.2, the thin blue and thick green Figure 3.2: The benchmark probabilities of a crisis and a crisis start
lines show the benchmark probability of a crisis
start and benchmark probability of a crisis in future quarters, conditional on no crisis in quarter 1.
The probability of a crisis is equal to the probability of a crisis starting in the last n quarters.
This is close to a simple linear approximation used in Svensson (2016a), equal to the sum of the
P
probabilities of a crisis start over the last n quarters, pt ≈ n−1
τ =0 qt−τ . As explained in appendix
C, the exact probability of a crisis, used in this paper, is given by a Markov process. As shown
in figure 3.2, it rises to 6.25% in quarter 9 and then falls back to a steady-state level of 6% from
quarter 14.15 The result for a higher probability of a crisis start and a crisis is examined in section 4.
In section 2, we noted that for the case of exogenous probability and magnitude of a crisis, the
optimal policy is LWW, to set each future expected non-crisis unemployment deviation negative
according to (2.13). For the benchmark steady-state probability of 6% and crisis increase in the
unemployment rate of 5 pp, the optimal non-crisis unemployment deviation is minus 30 basis points,
arguably too small to have any practical importance. But for LAW to be optimal, this tendency
towards LWW has to be overcome by sufficiently high marginal benefits of LAW.
All the components of the benchmark marginal cost, (2.9), have now been specified. It is thus
given by MCt = 2pt ∆u dE1 unt /dī1 = 10 pt dE1 unt /dī1 and is shown as the thin solid the red line in
figure 3.5.
15

The linear approximation rises to a steady-state level of 6.4% in quarter 9, see figure C.1. For the Markov
process, it is assumed that a new crisis does not start during an existing crisis, which in steady state reduces the
probability of a crisis somewhat from the linear approximation.

13

The marginal benefit from a lower probability of a crisis

For the benchmark marginal

benefit from a lower probability of a crisis, (2.10), we need an estimate of the policy-rate effect on
the probability of a crisis, dpt /dī1 , which in turn depends on the policy-rate effect on the probability
of a crisis start, dqt /dī1 , as shown in appendix C. For a benchmark estimate of the latter, I will
combine a benchmark estimate of the effect of debt on the probability of a crisis start with a
benchmark estimate of the policy-rate effect on debt.
The effect of debt on the probability of a crisis start

In a seminal paper, Schularick

and Taylor (2012) (ST for short), using annual data for 14 developed countries for 1870–2008, find
that financial crises are predicted by real debt growth lagged 1–5 years. During the work on IMF
(2015), IMF staff used a quarterly dataset of Laeven and Valencia (2012) for 35 advanced countries
and a more recent sample period, 1970–2011, to predict financial crises. As shown in detail in
Svensson (2016a, section 7), the IMF estimates lead to very similar results as the ST estimates.16
As a benchmark, I will thus use the estimates of ST (table 3, specification 5), in a quarterly
variant of their their main logit regression,
qt =

1 exp(Xt )
,
4 1 + exp(Xt )

(3.1)

Xt = − 3.89 − 0.398 gt−4 + 7.138∗∗∗ gt−8 + 0.888 gt−12 + 0.203 gt−16 + 1.867 gt−20 .

rate of (average annual) real debt, defined as gt ≡ log( 3τ =0 dt−τ /4) − log( 3τ =0 dt−4−τ /4), where
dt denotes the level of real debt in quarter t.18 The coefficients of the five lags are jointly significant
at the 1% level. However, annual real debt growth lagged 2 years, gt−8 , has the largest and most
significant coefficient in (3.2) and is thus the major determinant of the probability of a crisis start.
The policy-rate effect on debt

Given a benchmark for the effect of debt on the probability

of a crisis start, we need a benchmark for the policy-rate effect on real debt. IMF (2015, para. 24
and footnote 19) summarizes the estimates of this effect in several papers. It notes that “real debt
levels generally decrease following a temporary monetary policy tightening of 100 basis points, by
up to 0.3% and 2%, after 4 to 16 quarters, depending on the model” and that “Sveriges Riksbank
(2014a) comes to a middle-of-the-road result.”
16

I am grateful to Damiano Sandri for help with and several discussions about the IMF estimates.
One, two, and three stars denote significance at the 10, 5, and 1% level, respectively.
18
What is called real debt here is in ST total bank loans, defined as the end-of-year amount of outstanding domestic
currency lending by domestic banks to domestic households and nonfinancial corporations (excluding lending within
the financial system) deflated by the CPI.
17

14

As a benchmark, I will thus use the Sveriges Riksbank (2014a) estimate of the policy-rate effect
on real (household) debt from a 1 pp higher policy rate during 4 quarters. It is shown as the red
line in figure 3.3.19 Real debt falls by 1% in two years relative to the baseline and then rises back
to the baseline again in about 8 years. Because monetary policy is neutral, there is no long-run
effect on real debt. The result for monetary non-neutrality and a permanent effect on real debt
will be examined in section 4.

Figure 3.3: The policy-rate effect on real debt,
annual average real debt growth, and the probaity and, after about 40 quarters, no policy-rate bilities of a crisis start and a crisis
Importantly, because there is monetary neutral-

effect on real debt, there is no policy-rate effect on the cumulative growth rate.
The blue line in the figure shows the resulting policy-rate effect on the probability of a crisis
start, dqt /dī1 , that follows from (3.1) and (3.2). Recall that real debt growth lagged two years
is the main determinant of the probability of a crisis start. The probability of a crisis start falls
below the baseline to a minimum of − 0.04 pp in quarters 14 and 15, about two years after the
minimum of real debt growth rate in quarter 6. Furthermore, because real debt growth rises above
the baseline after quarter 12, the probability of a crisis will rise above the baseline after quarter 20
(barely visible in the figure).
The thick green line in the figure shows the policy-rate effect on the probability of a crisis,
dpt /dī1 . Because it is close to the linear approximation mentioned above, it is approximately an
8-quarter moving sum of the policy-rate effect on the probability of a crisis start. It has a minimum
of − 0.20 pp in quarter 18 and then rises back to zero and turns positive from quarter 24. It will
fall to zero at about quarter 60.20
19

The ST estimates refer to loans to both households and nonfinancial corporations, whereas the estimates in
Sveriges Riksbank (2014a) refer to loans to households only. I assume that this difference does not affect the result.
20
Because real debt growth lagged 5 years has a relatively large coefficient coefficient in (3.2), the probability of
a crisis is affected by real debt growth lagged up to 7 years.

15

The logistic function is convex but close to linear for the relevant range of real debt growth
rates (figure 4.3). Then the probability of a crisis start and of a crisis are approximately linear
in real debt growth. It follows that monetary neutrality and no permanent effect on real debt in
this case implies that the cumulative policy-rate effects of the probability of a crisis start and the
P
P60
probability of a crisis are approximately zero, 60
t=1 dqt /dī1 ≈
t=1 dpt /dī1 ≈ 0. Thus, a higher
policy rate reduces the probability of a crisis somewhat in 4–5 years and increases it after about 6
years, but with an approximately zero cumulative effect over about 60 quarters.
We now have all the components of the marginal benefit from a lower probability of a crisis,
(2.10). It is given by MBpt = (∆u)2 (−dpt /dīt ) = 25 (−dpt /dīt ), and is shown as the thin solid green
line in figure 3.5. In this case, monetary neutrality implies that the cumulative marginal benefit
from a lower probability of a crisis is approximately zero. As mentioned, section 4 examines the
result for monetary non-neutrality and a permanent effect on real debt, for which the cumulative
marginal benefit from a lower probability of a crisis will be positive.
The marginal benefit from a smaller magnitude of a crisis

In order to find a numerical

estimate of the marginal benefit from a smaller magnitude of a crisis, (2.11), we need to find an
estimate of the policy-rate effect on the magnitude of a crisis. A possible channel is the effect of
debt on the magnitude of a crisis combined with the policy-rate effect on debt.
The effect of debt on the magnitude of a crisis

Regarding the effect of debt on the

magnitude of a crisis, for the OECD countries Flodén (2014) finds that a lower household debt-toincome ratio in 2007 is associated with a lower increase in the unemployment rate during 2007-2012.
More precisely, a 1 pp lower debt-to-income ratio is associated with a 0.02 pp smaller increase in
the unemployment rate. Flodén’s estimate is similar to other estimates. Given this, I will use
Flodén’s estimate as a representative benchmark.
Jordà et al. (2013, table 8) (JST for short), with a dataset for 14 advanced countries 1870–2008,
report the effect on the GDP downturn in a financial recession of a 1 pp higher “excess credit.”
Here, excess credit denotes the yearly pp excess rate of change of aggregated bank loans relative
to GDP in the preceding expansion phase (previous trough to peak, where excess is determined
relative to the previous mean). The average effect on GDP over 5 years is −0.8 pp (the average of
the coefficients in table 8). Assuming an Okun coefficient of 2, this means an average increase in
the unemployment rate of 0.4 pp. Post-WWII, the average duration of an expansion phase is 9.46

16

years in the sample.21 A 1 pp higher excess credit over 9.46 years implies that the cumulative bankloans-to-GDP ratio is about 10% higher (1.019.46 − 1 = 0.0987). This means that a 1 percent higher
bank-loans-to-GDP ratio is associated with a 0.4/10 = 0.04 pp larger unemployment increase. If the
bank-loans-to-GDP ratio is about 100 percent, 1% is about 1 pp.22 Then, 1 pp higher bank loans
is associated with about 0.04 pp larger unemployment increase, about twice as large as Flodén’s
estimate. Krishnamurthy and Muir (2016, table 4), with a dataset for 14 countries 1869–2014, show
that a 1 pp higher 3-year growth in the credit-to-GDP ratio is associated with an (insignificant)
0.05 pp larger GDP decline from peak to trough in a financial crisis. With an Okun coefficient of 2,
a 0.05 pp decline in GDP is associated with a 0.025 pp rise in the unemployment rate, an estimate
similar to Flodén’s.

Figure 3.4: The policy-rate effect on the debtIt falls by 1.4 pp in quarter 4. This corresponds to-income ratio, the crisis magnitude, and the
marginal benefit from a smaller crisis magnitude
to a fall in debt to GDP of 0.8%.23 But this
(MB∆u )
policy-rate effect on the debt-to-income ratio is
too large to be consistent with the policy-rate effect on real debt in figure 3.3 and on the unemploy-

ment rate in figure 3.1. For an Okun coefficient of about 2, the policy-rate effect on GDP would be
a fall by about 1% in quarter 6-8, about the same as the fall in real debt in figure 3.3. This implies
that the effect on the debt-to-GDP ratio would be close to zero.24
In order to stack the cards in favor of LAW, I will nevertheless use the Riksbank estimate as
21

JST (table 3) reports an expansion-phase duration of 6.9 years for 30 observations of “Low excess credit” and a
duration of 11.8 years for 32 observations of “High excess credit.” The average, taking the numbers of observations
into account, is then 9.46 years
22
According to BIS (2016b, table F2.3), for advanced economies, bank loans to the private non-financial sector
were 83% of GDP in 2016Q1.
23
Sveriges Riksbank (2014a) estimates the policy-rate effect on the debt-to-GDP ratio and converts that into
the debt-to-(disposable)income ratio by assuming that income is proportional to GDP. The percent response of the
debt-to-GDP ratio is then converted into percentage points by multiplying by an initial household debt-to-income
ratio of 1.73. Thus, a fall of 1.4 percentage points is a fall of 1.4/1.73 = 0.8 percent.
24
This is consistent with the small or even positive policy-rate effect on GDP found in Alpanda and Zubairy
(2014), Bauer and Granziera (2016), Gelain et al. (2015), Robstad (2014), and Svensson (2013a,b).

a benchmark policy-rate effect on the debt-to-income ratio, even though it seems unrealistically
large. Then the policy-rate effect on the magnitude of a crisis, dE1 ∆ut /dī1 , is simply 0.02 times
the policy-rate effect on the debt-to-income ratio. It is shown as the dashed black line in figure 3.4
(measured along the right vertical axis). The maximum fall in the crisis unemployment increase is
about 0.03 pp for quarter 4.
The resulting marginal benefit from a smaller magnitude of a crisis, (2.11), is then given by
MB∆u

line in figure 3.4 and the thin dashed green line in figure 3.5.
The net marginal cost We now have all the components of the net marginal cost. Figure 3.5
shows the marginal cost (thin solid red), (2.9); the marginal benefit from a lower probability of a
crisis (thin solid green), (2.10); the marginal benefit from a smaller magnitude of crisis (thin dashed
green), (2.11); and the net marginal cost (thick solid blue), (2.12), the difference between the red
line and the sum of the solid and dashed green lines.
Figure 3.6 shows the corresponding (undiscounted) cumulative marginal cost, marginal benefits,
and net marginal cost. (Because the main marginal benefit occurs later than the main marginal
cost, not discounting stacks the cards in favor of LAW.)25 The result that the cumulative marginal
cost exceeds the cumulative marginal benefit by a substantial margin is clear.
Preliminarily, we also see an indication that an assumption of monetary non-neutrality and

The undiscounted cumulative discounted net marginal cost is the limit of (2.12) for δ → 1−.

a permanent effect on real debt would not change the result. Even if we disregard the negative
marginal benefit and positive marginal cost after quarter 24 by just looking at the cumulative net
marginal cost for quarter 24, the cumulative marginal cost still exceeds the marginal benefit by
a substantial margin. The role of monetary neutrality and non-neutrality is further examined in
section 4.

Robustness tests

The benchmark estimates and assumptions in the previous sections have been chosen to be representative and realistic or, for the policy-rate effect on debt to income, biased in favor of LAW. In
this section, I examine the robustness of the result to monetary non-neutrality and a permanent
policy-rate effects on real debt; a smaller policy-rate effect on unemployment; a credit boom and
a higher probability of a crisis start; a larger crisis magnitude; a longer crisis duration; inefficient
macroprudential policy; larger policy-rate effects on the probability and magnitude of a crisis, including how many standard errors larger effects are required for break-even; and, finally, using debt
to GDP (including using 5-year moving averages as in Jordà et al. (2016)) instead of real debt as
a predictor of crises.
Non-neutral monetary policy and a permanent effect on real debt Assume that there
is monetary non-neutrality in the form of a permanent effect on real debt. More precisely, assume

19

that real debt permanently stays down at its maximum deviation from the baseline in figure 3.3
(−1.03%) from quarter 8 onwards, as shown in figure 4.1. Then there is a persistent, but not
permanent, fall in the probability of a crisis. As shown in figure 4.2, the resulting marginal benefit
is larger, more persistent, and never negative. Nevertheless, it is clear that this marginal benefit
is not sufficient to prevent the cumulative marginal cost from exceeding the cumulative marginal
benefit by a substantial margin. The result is robust to monetary non-neutrality and a permanent
policy-rate effect on real debt.
A smaller policy-rate effect on the non-crisis unemployment rate

A smaller policy-rate

effect on the non-crisis unemployment rate will reduce the cumulative marginal cost and make
it exceed the cumulative marginal benefit by less, or even fall short of the cumulative marginal
benefit. Suppose that the policy-rate effect is only half the benchmark effect. That is, the policyrate effect is assumed to be substantially smaller than the one reported in IMF (2015, para. 40
and footnote 42) for its GIMF model and somewhat smaller than the impulse response of the U.S.
unemployment rate estimated in Stock and Watson (2001, figure 1) (when adjusted to a similar
cumulative policy-rate impulse as discussed in footnote 14). This would result in half the marginal
cost in figure 3.5 and half the cumulative marginal cost in figure 3.6. Clearly, the cumulative
marginal cost would still exceed the cumulative marginal benefit by a substantial margin.
Furthermore, if monetary non-neutrality and a permanent policy-rate effect on real debt is
assumed as in figure 4.1, it is clear from figure 4.2 that half the benchmark policy-rate effect on the
non-crisis unemployment rate would also in that case make the cumulative marginal cost exceed
the cumulative marginal benefit by a substantial margin.
A credit boom and a higher probability of a crisis start

How does a credit boom with

an associated higher probability of a crisis start affect the net marginal cost of LAW? The conventional wisdom is certainly that this would be favorable to LAW, in the sense of reducing the net
marginal cost of LAW, perhaps even make it. But this conventional wisdom is wrong in the current
framework.
Figure 4.3 shows how the annual probability of a crisis start depends on annual steady real
debt growth rate for the logit model (3.1) and (3.2) and the ST estimates. Point A corresponds
to the benchmark annual real debt growth and annual probability of a crisis start of, respectively,
5% and 3.2%. Assume a credit boom corresponding to point B, with annual real debt growth and

Figure 4.4: The effect of a higher probability
of a crisis start (dashed lines) on the marginal
cost, marginal benefit, and net marginal cost

probability of a crisis of, respectively, 7.9% and 4.2%.
In order to stack the cards in favor of LAW, assume again monetary non-neutrality and a
permanent policy-rate effect on real debt. In figure 4.4, the solid lines show the benchmark marginal
cost, marginal benefit, and net marginal cost under this assumption, the same as in figure 4.2, except
that only the sum (2.8) of the two marginal benefits is shown. The dashed lines show effect of the
higher probability of a crisis start. The cumulative net marginal cost will be higher, not lower,
so a credit boom with a higher probability of a crisis increases the marginal cost more than the
marginal benefit. How can that be?
The higher probability of a crisis start, qt , leads to a higher probability of a crisis, pt . In
figure 3.2, the quarterly probability of a crisis start will be 4.2/4 = 1.05%, and the probability of
a crisis start will rise to 8.1% in quarter 9 and then fall back to 7.8%.
Both the marginal cost (2.9) and the marginal benefit (2.11) are linear in the probability of
a crisis, so the higher probability of a crisis then shifts up both in proportion. But because the
marginal cost is higher than the marginal benefit from a smaller magnitude of a crisis, the net effect
is an increase the net marginal cost. Furthermore, we see in figure 4.3 that the probability of a
crisis start is slightly convex as a function of real debt growth. This means that, at point B, the
probability of a crisis start and the probability of a crisis are somewhat more sensitive to real debt
growth. Then the marginal benefit from a lower probability of a crisis, (2.10), will be somewhat
higher. This shifts up the marginal benefit a bit. But we see that the net effect is still to shift up
the net marginal cost and to make the cumulative net marginal cost higher.

Figure 4.6: The effect of a longer crisis duration
(dashed lines) on the marginal cost, marginal
benefit, and net marginal cost

Thus, a credit boom and a corresponding higher probability of a crisis increases the cumulative
net marginal cost of LAW, counter to the conventional wisdom.26
A larger crisis magnitude The conventional wisdom is certainly that a larger magnitude of a
crisis would be favorable to LAW. Again the conventional wisdom is wrong in the present framework,
except for extremely large crisis magnitudes.
A larger magnitude of a crisis is here represented by a larger crisis increase in the unemployment
rate, ∆u. The dashed lines in figure 4.5 show the marginal cost, marginal benefit, and net marginal
cost for a ∆u equal to 6 pp instead of the benchmark 5 pp. Again, I assume monetary nonneutrality and a permanent policy-rate effect on real debt, in order to stack the cards in favor of
LAW. But as we see, the net marginal cost instead increases, except around quarters 19 and 20,
and the cumulative net marginal cost increases, counter to the conventional wisdom.
To understand this, note that the marginal cost (2.9) and the marginal benefit from a smaller
magnitude of a crisis (2.11) are both linear in ∆u and shift up in proportion. But because the
marginal cost is larger, the net effect is to increase the net marginal cost. Furthermore, we see from
(2.10) that the marginal benefit from a lower probability of a crisis is quadratic in ∆u. This shifts
up the marginal benefit more than in proportion and reduces the net marginal cost. But because
the marginal benefit from a lower probability of a crisis is relatively small, the net effect of the
shifts in the marginal cost and benefits is an increase in cumulative marginal cost.
26

Discussions with Helge Berger were helpful for the interpretation of this result.

22

However, because the marginal cost is linear but the marginal benefit from lower probability
of a crisis is quadratic in ∆u, we realize that a sufficiently large ∆u can increase the marginal
benefit from a lower probability of a crisis so much as to achieve break-even, with the cumulative
net marginal cost of LAW equal to zero. But this requires an extremely large ∆u of 32 pp.27
A longer crisis duration

The conventional wisdom is certainly that a longer duration of a

crisis would favor LAW. But instead the cumulative net marginal cost increases, counter to the
conventional wisdom.
In figure 4.6, the dashed lines show the marginal cost, marginal benefit, and net marginal cost
for a longer crisis duration of n = 12 quarters instead of the benchmark 8 quarters. In figure 3.2, a
longer duration of 12 quarters means that the probability of crisis rises further to 9.2% in quarter 13
and then falls back to 8.8% rather than 6%. As a result of the longer duration and higher probability
of a crisis, both the marginal cost and the marginal benefit are extended to the right and shifted
up. Because the marginal cost is initially higher than the marginal benefit, this will increase the
net marginal cost, except around quarter 24, where the marginal benefit increases slightly more
than the marginal cost. The result is that the cumulative net marginal cost increases.
Inefficient macroprudential policy The conventional wisdom is certainly that LAW is more
appropriate in a situation with less effective macroprudential policy. Such a situation would likely
imply a more vulnerable economy, with higher probability, larger magnitude, or longer duration of
crises. But above we have seen that for each of these changes, the costs exceed the benefits by an
even larger margin. Thus, this conventional wisdom is wrong here.
A larger policy-rate effect on the probability of crisis

As mentioned, the benchmark

policy-rate effect on the probability of a crisis is constructed from the Sveriges Riksbank (2014a)
estimate of the policy-rate effect on household debt combined with the ST estimate of the effect
of debt on the probability of a crisis start. For monetary monetary neutrality and no permanent
policy-rate effect on real debt, the cumulative marginal benefit from a lower probability of a crisis
is approximately zero. Then a larger policy-rate effect on debt or a larger effect of debt on the
probability of a crisis would still have an approximately zero effect on the cumulative net marginal
27
Because the policy-rate effect on the non-crisis unemployment rate and the marginal cost are still positive
at quarter 40, for a precise result the horizon needs to be extended further; 60 quarters is sufficient. Beyond
quarter 40, because there is no data on the Riksbank policy-rate effect on the unemployment rate, it is assumed to
fall exponentially at a rate 3 times faster than the rate from quarter 32 to 40 (so as to not exaggerate the marginal
cost beyond quarter 40). Then ∆u = 32 pp makes the cumulative net marginal cost at quarter 60 close to zero.

23

cost.
In order to stack the cards in favor of LAW, let me then again assume monetary non-neutrality
and a permanent policy-rate effect on real debt. Then the cumulative marginal benefit from a
lower probability of a crisis is positive, as shown in figure 4.4, and a larger policy-rate effect on the
probability of a crisis would increase the cumulative marginal benefit and reduce the cumulative
net marginal cost.
To achieve break-even, that is, a cumulative net marginal cost equal to zero, the policy-rate
effect on the probability of a crisis start, dqt /dī1 , then needs to be about 6.4 times as large as the
benchmark.
A larger policy-rate effect on the probability of a crisis start can be achieved through a larger
policy-rate effect on debt or a larger effect of debt on the probability of a crisis start, or both.
Assume that it is achieved through a larger policy-rate effect on debt. For break-even, the policyrate effect on real debt then needs to be 6.4 times as large as the Riksbank estimate (the red line
in figure 3.3). That is, real debt needs to fall by about 6.4% in quarter 8 instead of 1%. With a
standard error of about 1 pp, this is an effect about 5.4 standard errors larger than the Riksbank
estimate. Clearly, the margin to break-even is large.28
If break-even is achieved through a larger effect of debt on the probability of a crisis start, the
effect needs to be about 6.4 times as large as the ST estimate. This implies an effect that is about
15 standard errors larger than the ST estimate. Clearly, the margin to break-even is quite large.29
For some LAW to be optimal, the policy-rate effect on the probability of a crisis needs to be
even larger. For a permanent effect on real debt, for ∆ī1 = 0.5 pp to be (approximately) optimal
an effect 10 times as large as the benchmark is required.
A larger policy-rate effect on the magnitude of a crisis

The benchmark policy-rate effect

on the magnitude of a crisis uses the Sveriges Riksbank (2014a) estimate of the policy-rate effect
on household debt to income and combines it with the Flodén (2014) estimate of the effect on debt
to income on the magnitude of a crisis. A larger (negative) policy rate effect on the magnitude of
a crisis would increase the marginal benefit from a smaller magnitude and reduce the cumulative
net marginal cost. But just to achieve break-even requires a policy-rate effect on the magnitude of
28

Sveriges Riksbank (2014a, figure A20) reports uncertainty intervals around the point estimate of the policy-rate
effect on real debt. The 12.5 + 75 = 87.5th percentile exceeds the point estimate at quarter 8 by 1 pp, which can
then be taken to be an approximate (upper bound of the) standard error.
29
The largest and most significant coefficient is 7.138, with a standard error of 2.631 (ST (table 3, specification 6)).
The required effect needs to be 6.43 times as large. Then the coefficient needs to increase by (6.43 − 1) · 7.138/2.631 =
14.7 standard errors.

24

a crisis that is about 20 times as large as the benchmark effect.
The larger policy-rate effect on the magnitude of a crisis start can be achieved through a larger
policy-rate effect on debt to income or a larger effect of debt to income on the magnitude of a crisis,
or both. If break-even is achieved through a larger policy-rate effect on debt to income, the effect
needs to be about 20 times as large as the Riksbank estimate (the solid red line in figure 3.4). The
average benchmark effect for quarters 4–10 is a fall of 1.13 pp. For break-even, debt to income then
needs to fall by about 21 pp for quarters 4–10. This is an effect that is about 13 standard errors
larger than the benchmark effect. Clearly, the margin to break-even is quite large.30
If break-even is achieved through a larger effect of debt to income on the magnitude of a crisis,
it needs to be about 18 times as large as the Flodén (2014, table 4, column 1) estimate. This
implies an effect that is about 43 standard errors larger than the Flodén estimate and about 12
standard errors larger than the estimate that follows from JST. Clearly, the margin to break-even
is quite large.31
For some LAW to be optimal, the policy-rate effect on the magnitude of a a crisis needs to be
even larger. For a permanent effect on real debt, for ∆ī1 = 0.5 pp to be (approximately) optimal,
an effect 30 times as large as the benchmark is required.
Debt to GDP instead of real debt and 5-year moving averages

One might think that

using debt-to-GDP instead of real debt as a predictor of crisis might lead to a different result. But
this is not so.
ST (table 4, specification 9) report a specification where the annual growth of real debt in the
logistic function is replaced by the annual growth of debt to income. Jordà et al. (2016) use a 5-year
moving average of the annual growth of debt to income. Using the debt-to-GDP ratio instead of
30
Sveriges Riksbank (2014a, figure A22) reports uncertainty intervals around the point estimate of the policy-rate
effect on debt to income. The 12.5 + 75 = 87.5th percentile exceeds the point estimates on average about 1.6 pp
around quarters 4–10. This can be taken as an approximate (upper bound of the) standard error. The effect then
needs to increase by (20 − 1) · 1.13/1.6 = 13.4 standard errors.
31
The benchmark estimate used is 0.02 and the required effect is 0.406. Flodén’s estimate of the effect is actually 0.0230, with a standard error of 0.00897. (Flodén (2014, table 4, column 1) does not report the standard error
and reports the point estimate with only two decimals, but the data and programs to replicate his estimate and
extract the standard error are available at http://martinfloden.net/files/hhdebt_replicate.zip.) This means
that the required effect is 0.41/0.023 = 17.8 as large as Flodén’s estimate, (0.41-0.023)/0.00897 = 43.1 standard
errors larger.
The estimated effect of credit to GDP on the unemployment increase that follows from JST (table 8) is 0.04, as
explained in section 3. The average standard error over years 1–5 for the effect of excess credit on GDP is 0.625 (in
the row “Excess credit × financial recession” in table 8). With an Okun coefficient of 2, the average standard error
for the effect of excess credit on the crisis increase in the unemployment rate can be considered to be 0.625/2 = 0.313.
Because 1 pp excess credit per year corresponds to about a 10 pp higher credit-to-GDP ratio, the standard error
for the effect of credit to GDP on the crisis increase in unemployment is 0.313/10 = 0.0313. This means that the
required effect for break-even is approximately (0.41 − 0.04)/0.0313 = 11.8 standard errors larger than the estimate
that follows from JST.

25

real debt or using 5-year moving averages of it instead of 5 lags lead to a policy-rate effect on the
probability of a crisis and a marginal benefit of LAW similar to the ones in, respectively, figures 3.3
and 3.5. Thus, the cumulative marginal cost still exceeds the cumulative marginal benefit by a
substantial margin.
ST (table 7, specification 22) contains a logit regression of the annual probability of a crisis
start, where the log of the debt-to-GDP ratio is added as an explanatory variable in the logistic
function (3.1) and (3.2). Svensson (2016a, appendix D) shows that adding this explanatory variable
has a negligible effect on the probability of a crisis start and the marginal benefit in, respectively,
figures 3.3 and 3.5, and thus does not affect the result.

5

Conclusions and qualifications

A simple, transparent, and robust framework for a cost-benefit analysis of LAW has been presented.
The costs of LAW are not only a weaker economy if no crisis occurs. There is also a second cost,
namely, for a given magnitude of a crisis a weaker economy if a crisis occurs. The crisis loss
and the cost of a crisis (the crisis loss less the non-crisis loss) will for a given magnitude of a
crisis be higher with LAW, something that has been overlooked by the previous literature. The
possible benefits of LAW include a lower probability and smaller magnitude of a crisis. For existing
representative empirical estimates and reasonable assumptions, the result is that the costs of LAW
exceed the benefits by a substantial margin. The reason is that the empirical policy-rate effects on
the probability and magnitude of a crisis are far too small to make the benefits of LAW match the
cost.
The result is robust to monetary non-neutrality and a permanent policy-rate effect on real debt;
a smaller policy-rate effect on unemployment; a credit boom with a higher probability of a crisis;
a larger crisis magnitude; a longer crisis duration; larger policy-rate effects on the probability and
duration of a crisis; and using debt to GDP, including 5-year moving averages, instead of real
debt as a predictor of crises. In particular, to overturn the result the policy-rate effects on the
probability and magnitude of a crisis need to be more than 5–40 standard errors larger than the
point estimates, in spite of some of the estimates having large standard errors relative to the point
estimates. This indicates that the result is quite robust.
Given the simplicity and transparency of the framework and its dependence on only a few
assumptions and empirical estimates of the policy-rate effects on unemployment and the probability

26

and magnitude of a crisis, it is easy to redo the analysis with alternative assumptions or new
alternative or better empirical estimates. This way the robustness of the result can be further
examined.
Some previous or recent papers (including Ajello et al. (2016), FR, and GKS) have found that
some LAW is optimal. But, as shown in Svensson (2016a, 2017b) and discussed in section 1, this
is due to different but less realistic assumptions about the costs of LAW, namely that either the
crisis loss level or the cost of a crisis is independent of LAW. Furthermore, the optimal LAW and
net gain is then too small to have any practical relevance, corresponding to only a few basis points
higher policy rate or a few basis points lower probability of a crisis.
A possible objection to the framework and result of this paper is that LAW need not be an
unanticipated temporary increase in the policy rate as represented here. Instead it could instead
be a different policy regime, where the policy rate systematically responds to indicators of financial
instability for financial-stability purposes and where this systematic response is incorporated into
private-sector expectations and changes private-sector behavior.
However, first, if such a systematic LAW is a good and robust policy, it should be beneficial
also when it is done as a temporary increase in the policy rate, and the policy should pass the costbenefit test conducted in this paper. Furthermore, it is easy to see considerable conceptual and
practical difficulties with a systematic policy of LAW, and after its introduction it could realistically
take several years, if not forever, for it to be credible and affect expectations.
Second, a temporary policy-rate increase can be seen in the light of standard so-called “calculus
of variations,” the generalization of calculus used in dynamic optimization theory. According to
this, the optimality of any policy can be checked (and the first-order conditions for optimality be
derived) from the effects on the (intertemporal) loss of any deviation from the policy, including
the temporary policy rate increase used in this framework. The optimality condition is that any
policy deviation must not reduce the loss. If the loss increases for a particular deviation and falls
for the opposite deviation, this indicates that the optimal policy lies in the latter direction. In
this framework, the loss increases for a higher and falls for a lower policy-rate, indicating that the
optimal policy lies in the latter direction. (However, the optimal leaning with the wind is too small
to have any practical relevance.)
Third, it may of course be of interest to examine the consequences of a systematic policy of LAW
and how it might affect expectations. But any such examination of a systematic policy requires
a complicated model with many assumptions and complicated parameter estimation. The results
27

will be heavily model-dependent and not very robust. It is of course always possible to construct
a model in which some LAW is optimal; the question is how reasonable and realistic the model
is. The simplicity and transparency of the framework here and, in particular, its dependence on
only a few assumptions and estimates may in many or most cases imply a more reliable and robust
examination of the costs and benefits of LAW. In any case, the substantial margin by which the costs
of LAW exceed the benefits for the benchmark estimates in this framework and the robustness tests
passed arguably make it rather unlikely that the outcome for a systematic policy of LAW would
be different in a reasonable and realistic model.
A second possible objection is that one might expect LAW to be more appropriate and effective
in a situation with a credit boom and an elevated probability of a financial crisis. However, this
is precisely the situation considered in one of the robustness tests in section 4, namely, a higher
growth of debt with a higher probability of a crisis that is more sensitive to debt growth and the
policy rate. As shown, in such a situation the margin of costs over benefits is even larger.
A third possible and somewhat related objection is the conventional wisdom that LAW may
be appropriate as a last resort, that is, in a situation with less effective (if not non-existing)
macroprudential policy. Although there is no explicit macroprudential policy in the framework
here, we would expect less effective macroprudential policy to result in a more vulnerable economy,
with a higher probability, a larger magnitude, or a longer duration of crises. But the robustness
tests for these three alternatives show that, for each of them, the costs of LAW increase more than
the benefits, making the costs exceed the benefits by an even larger margin. Thus, this conventional
wisdom is wrong here, and the result supports Williams (2015) conclusion that “monetary policy
is poorly suited for dealing with financial stability concerns, even as a last resort” (italics added).
A fourth possible objection, suggested by AD, is that the so-called risk-taking channel, according
to which a low policy rate increases the risk-taking of financial institutions, could increase the
policy-rate effect on the probability or magnitude of crisis. But, first, more risk-taking need not
imply “excessive” risk-taking. Second, to the extent that any risk-taking channel works through
increased debt growth, its predictive power for crises may be picked up by the reduce-form results
of ST. Third, I am not aware of any empirical results that the risk-taking channel is economically
significant. In a thorough and comprehensive study, Dell’Ariccia et al. (2017) find that the federal
funds rate has a statistically significant effect on the loan risk ranking of U.S. banks, but the effect
is economically insignificant. An increase of 1 pp of the federal funds rate reduces the loan-risk
measure by only about 1/16 of its standard deviation, implying that loan risk is mainly determined
28

by other factors.32
The main reason why the costs of LAW exceed the benefits by a substantial margin is the small
empirical policy-rate effects on the probability and magnitude of a crisis. Stein (2013) has suggested
that monetary policy has one important advantage relative to supervision and regulation—namely
that it “gets in all of the cracks.” However, according to the numbers presented in this paper,
a sizable policy-rate increase increase will barely cover the bottom of these cracks, much less fill
them. Instead, so far, a general policy conclusion seems to be that, in order to substantially reduce
the probability and magnitude of a financial crises there is no choice but to rely on other policies
than monetary policy, such as micro- and macroprudential, housing, or fiscal policies, depending
on the nature of the problem. For example, Dagher et al. (2016) show that around 20% bank
capital relative to risk-weighted assets might have been enough to avoid about 80% of the historical
banking crises in the OECD countries since 1970. Thus, more but still relatively modest capital
may lead to a much larger fall in the probability and frequency of crises than the small reductions
that monetary policy so far seems able to achieve.
However, one should obviously never say never. One cannot of course exclude that newer
and better empirical estimates—including data from emerging markets and not only advanced
economies—or new channels for the policy-rate effects on the probability and magnitude of crises
could overturn the result here about the costs and benefits of LAW.

Appendix
A

The optimal unemployment rate and the indirect loss function

Assume a quadratic loss function of inflation and unemployment,
L∗ (πt , ut ) ≡ πt2 + λ(ut − ū)2 ,

(A.1)

where πt denotes the gap between the inflation rate in quarter t and and a fixed inflation target, and
ut − ū denotes the gap between the unemployment rate ut in quarter t and the long-run sustainable
unemployment rate ū, and λ > 0 denotes the constant weight on unemployment-gap stabilization
relative to inflation-gap stabilization. With a positive weight on both inflation and unemployment
stabilization, this loss function represents flexible inflation targeting.
Assume a simple Phillips curve,
πt = − κ(ut − ū) + zt ,

(A.2)

where zt is an exogenous stochastic process with a zero unconditional mean. It represents cost-push
shocks that cause a tradeoff between stabilizing inflation at the inflation target and unemployment
rate at its long-run sustainable rate.
Using (A.2) to substitue for πt in (A.1) results in
L∗ [− κ(ut − ū) + zt , ut ] = [− κ(ut − ū) + zt ]2 + λ(ut − ū)2 .

(A.3)

Choosing ut to minimize (A.3) gives the optimal unemployment rate under flexible inflation targeting, u∗t , which satisfies
u∗t ≡ ū +

κzt
.
λ + κ2

(A.4)

Using (A.4) to replace zt in (A.3) results, after some algebra, in the indirect loss function
L0 (ut , u∗t ), which satisfies

where the simple loss function L(ut − u∗t ) is given by
L(ut − u∗t ) ≡ (ut − u∗t )2 .
.
34

(A.6)

Clearly, choosing ut to minimize the simple loss function (A.6) is equivalent to choosing ut to
minimize (A.5) and thus to choosing ut to minimize (A.1) subject to (A.2).
The optimal unemployment rate under flexible inflation targeting, u∗t , is called the benchmark
unemployment rate. The deviation between the actual unemployment rate and the benchmark
unemployment rate, ut − u∗t , will be called the unemployment deviation.

B

A cost-push shock correlated with the crisis

A crisis is considered to be a negative demand shock that, net of possible conventional and unconventional policy actions during the crisis to reduce its costs, increases the unemployment deviation,
ũt ≡ ut − u∗t , by the amount ∆ut > 0. The demand shock and the cost-push shock, zt , are assumed
to be independent. Then, by (A.4), u∗t , the benchmark unemployment rate, is independent of a
crisis and ∆ut is the crisis increase in the unemployment rate, ut .
By (A.5)-(A.6), we can write the quarter-1 expectation of the quarter-t loss increase in a crisis,
the cost of a crisis, as
E1 [L0 (ut , u∗t )|c] − E1 [L0 (ut , u∗t )|n] = (λ + κ2 ){E1 [(ut − u∗t )2 |c] − E1 [(ut − u∗t )2 |n}
+

λ(λ + κ2 )
{E1 [(u∗t − ū)2 |c] − E1 [(u∗t − ū)2 |n]},
κ2

(B.1)

where c and n denote, respectively, crisis and non-crisis, and where the last term on the right side
is zero and can be disregarded if the cost-push shock is independent of the crisis, which is the
maintained assumption.
If instead the cost-push shock is assumed to be correlated with the crisis, that last term in (B.1)
is exogenous but not zero and has to be included in the cost of a crisis. Furthermore, then u∗t is
not independent of whether there is a crisis or not. With the non-crisis and crisis unemployment

gaps satisfying ũnt ≡ unt − u∗n
t and ũt ≡ ut − ut , for them to satisfy ũt = ũt + ∆ut , ∆ut has to

satisfy ∆ut ≡ (uct − unt ) − (u∗c
t − ut ). That is, ∆u is then defined as the crisis increase in the

unemployment deviation and equals the crisis increase in the unemployment rate less the crisis
increase in the benchmark unemployment rate. With these modifications, the analysis in the paper
can be done also for a cost-push shock correlated with a crisis.33

C

A Markov process for crisis and non-crisis states

Consider the situation in which the (quarterly) probability of a crisis start is q and the crisis
duration n quarters. Assume for simplicity that a new crisis cannot start during an existing crisis,
so the probability of crisis start is conditional on no crisis in the previous quarter. This situation
can be modeled as a Markov process with n + 1 states, where state 1 corresponds to a non-crisis
and state j for 2 ≤ j ≤ n + 1 corresponds to a crisis in its (j − 1)th quarter.34
Let the (n + 1) × (n + 1) transition matrix be P = [Pij ], where Pij = Pr(j in (t + 1)|i in t) is
the probability of a transition from state i in quarter t to state j in quarter t + 1. The transition
probabilities will be zero except for P11 = 1 − q, P12 = q, Pi,i+1 = 1 for 2 ≤ i ≤ n, and Pn+1,1 = 1.
For example, for n = 3 the 4 × 4 transition matrix is

quarters and the linear approximation .

The solid green line in figure C.1 shows the resulting probability of a crisis in quarter t , when
q = 0.8% and n = 8 quarters. The probability of a crisis rises to 6.25% and then falls back to
6%. The dashed green line shows the probability of a crisis for the linear approximation when the
probability of crisis is just the sum of the probabilities of a crisis start over the previous n quarters,

I am grateful for helpful discussions with Stefan Laséen and David Vestin on the Markov process of crisis and
non-crisis states.

36

The linear approximation increases to 6.4% and exaggerates the probability of a crisis somewhat.
It was for simplicity used in Svensson (2016a).
The main advantage with the linear approximation (C.2), is that the policy-rate effect on the
probability of a crisis is easy to calculate. Given the effect on the probability of a crisis start,
dqt /dī1 for t ≥ 1, from figure 3.3, it simply satisfies
n−1

dpt X dqt
=
.
dī1
dī1

(C.3)

τ =0

For the Markov process, the calculation is a bit more complicated. Let Pt = [Pt,ij ] for t ≥ 1,
denote the transition matrix from states in quarter t to states in quarter t+1, where Pt−1,11 = 1−qt ,
Pt−1,12 = qt and Pt−1,ij = Pij for (i, j) 6= (1, 1), (1, 2). We have
πt = πt−1 Pt−1 for t ≥ 2.

(C.4)

Then policy-rate effect on the probability distribution satisfies

dπt−1
dPt−1

Pt−1 + πt−1
for t ≥ 2,

(i, j) 6= (1, 1), (1, 2). Then

(C.6)

Svensson (2016a) shows that the linear approximation (C.3) of the derivative is relatively good
for the range of parameters used here. Nevertheless, the exact derivative (C.4)-(C.6) is used in this
paper.

The logistic function

Consider the logistic function
q=

exp(a + bg)
1
=
,
1 + exp(a + bg)
1 + exp[− (a + bg)]

(D.1)

where q here is the annual probability of a crisis start, g is a the steady annual growth rate of real
debt and a and b are constants. In a logit regression of crises starts on current and lagged annual
growth rates of real debt, b corresponds to the sum of the coefficients on the lagged annual growth
rates.

37

The derivative of q with respect to g, the marginal effect of steady real debt growth on the
probability q, satisfies
dq
= bq(1 − q).
dg

(D.2)

The sum of coefficients in (3.2) is b = 9.698. Given the dq/dg = 0.30 reported by Schularick
and Taylor (2012), it follows from (D.2) that q = 0.032. (To be precise, the values used are
dq/dg = 0.3016 and q = 0.0321.) Given b and q, if g = 0.05 it follows from (D.1) that a = − 3.890.
Section 4 examines the case when g = 0.079. Then q = 0.0421, and dq/dg = 0.3914.
