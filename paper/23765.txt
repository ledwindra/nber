The Impact of Partial-Year Enrollment on the Accuracy of Risk Adjustment Systems: A Framework
and Evidence

ABSTRACT
Accurate risk adjustment facilitates healthcare market competition. Risk adjustment typically
aims to predict annual costs of individuals enrolled in an insurance plan for a full year. However,
partial-year enrollment is common and poses a challenge to risk adjustment, since diagnoses are
observed with lower probability when individual is observed for a shorter time. Due to missed
diagnoses, risk adjustment systems will underpay for partial-year enrollees, as compared to fullyear enrollees with similar underlying health status and usage patterns. We derive a new
adjustment for partial-year enrollment in which payments are scaled up for partial-year enrollees’
observed diagnoses, which improves upon existing methods. We simulate the role of missed
diagnoses using a sample of commercially insured individuals and the 2014 Marketplace risk
adjustment algorithm, and find the expected spending of six-month enrollees is underpredicted by
19%. We then examine whether there are systematically different care usage patterns for partialyear enrollees in this data, which can offset or amplify underprediction due to missed diagnoses.
Accounting for differential spending patterns of partial-year enrollees does not substantially
change the underprediction for six-month enrollees. However, one-month enrollees use
systematically less than one-twelfth the care of full-year enrollees, partially offsetting the missed
diagnosis effect.

INTRODUCTION

Risk adjustment plays a crucial role in facilitating healthcare market competition. Risk
adjustment is used to ensure that when premiums do not vary by health status insurers do not
have incentives to avoid sicker enrollees. Moreover, if quality benchmarks are risk adjusted for
patient condition severity, providers would want to avoid sicker patients that might make their
performance measures look worse. Thus, failures of risk adjustment can lead to serious
distortions in insurer and provider behavior, with corresponding welfare loss to consumers
(Glazer and McGuire 2000). In this paper, we point out a major failure of existing risk
adjustment systems — they do not correctly compensate for enrollees who are observed for less
than the full contract year. We quantify the extent of the distortion for commercially insured
working age adults and present a model that shows how to correctly adjust for partial year
enrollment.
In insurance markets, risk adjustment systems transfer money from plans that enroll a
healthier-than-average population to plans that enroll a sicker-than-average population. Most risk
adjustment systems are diagnosis-based: the risk adjustment payments an insurance plan receives
for its enrollees are a function of the diagnoses those enrollees receive that are coded in
insurance claims.1 For example, in such a system, an insurance plan will receive a larger
payment if an individual is diagnosed with diabetes than if they were otherwise healthy.
In insurance markets, risk adjustment helps avoid both pricing distortions due to adverse
selection, as well as contract design distortions in which insurers reduce the availability of
services valued by sicker enrollees (Geruso and Layton 2015; Glazer and McGuire 2000). As a
result, diagnosis based risk adjustment is used in many health insurance markets in the U.S.,

Alternatives to diagnosis-based risk adjustment include payments based simply on age and gender, or based on
previous spending amounts.

including Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, Medicaid managed care in many states, and
most recently, the federal and state health insurance marketplaces (“Marketplaces”) created by
the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA). 2 In European markets with health insurer competition
such as Germany and the Netherlands, risk adjustment also plays a major role (Buchner,
Goepffarth, and Wasem 2013; van Kleef et al. 2016).3 A large literature on risk adjustment for
health insurance exists (see Van de Ven and Ellis (2000) for a review).
A typical risk adjustment system (e.g. that used in the Marketplaces), predicts an
enrollee’s spending over a fixed period – generally, one year – based on the diagnoses observed
for that patient during that time (Ellis 2007).4 While health insurance contracts typically last a
year, an individual may be enrolled—thus observed by the risk adjustment system—for only a
portion of the year if they switch coverage mid-year (e.g., due to a qualifying event).
Diagnosis-based risk adjustment is not limited to insurer competition; it is also used to
adjust performance benchmarks in evaluating healthcare quality. For instance, as part of the
ACA’s Hospital Readmissions Reduction program, hospitals are financially penalized for excess
readmissions above a risk-adjusted benchmark (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2017;
McIlvennan, Eapen, and Allen 2015); the risk adjustment for this benchmark uses diagnoses
observed in the previous 12 months of claims if available. Moreover, if an individual has a
shorter inpatient stay (and thus is less intensely observed by the provider), fewer secondary

For more detail on the role of risk adjustment, see Kautter et al. (2014a) and Hall (2011) on the Marketplaces, Pope
et al. (2004) on Medicare Advantage, Hsu (2009) on Medicare Part D, and Center for Health Program Development
and Management and Actuarial Research Corporation (2003) and Winkelman and Damler (2008) on Medicaid
Managed Care.

This is called concurrent risk-adjustment, in which data from a period is used to predict that period’s costs (e.g.,
claims data from 2017 are used to predict costs for 2017). Prospective risk adjustment uses data from a previous
time period to predict costs in the future, and raises similar issues if individuals vary in the length of time they are
observed.

diagnoses may be recorded during this stay; this will result in individuals with shorter hospital
stays appearing healthier than they would appear if they were simply observed longer.
For diagnoses to be compensated for, they need to be observed and coded. We examine
how variation in the amount of time an individual is enrolled and observed by the system affects
risk adjustment. That is, how well does risk adjustment work for individuals who are only
enrolled for a portion of the contract year (“partial-year enrollment”)? Partial-year enrollment is
pervasive in the U.S. In Medicaid, about half of enrollees lose eligibility within a year of joining
(Swartz et al. 2015). In the Marketplaces, data suggest that at least a third of enrollees are not
enrolled for the full year.5 Individuals may move between the Marketplaces, Medicaid (Sommers
and Rosenbaum 2011), and employer-sponsored insurance (Graves and Swartz 2013) due to
income fluctuations that affect Medicaid eligibility or from job transitions entailing a gain or loss
of employer sponsored insurance (Buettgens et al. 2012; Short et al. 2012).6 Partial year
enrollment also occurs in Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D due to aging into the system,
death, and specific qualifying events (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2017b).
Many risk adjustment systems address the issue of partial-year enrollees by ignoring
diagnosis data for partial-year enrollees: for instance, in Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part
D, payments for enrollees without 12 months of prior claims are paid using separate formulas

5

Exact data on of partial-year enrollment in the Marketplaces is unavailable. Pre-ACA estimates from individual
and small group markets suggest mid-year turnover or enrollment of less than 12 months among approximately 40%
of enrollees (Cebul et al. 2008; Ericson and Starc 2012; Hall 2011; Sommers 2014). A 2015 survey indicated 21% of
Marketplace enrollees dropped coverage mid-year (McKinsey & Company Center for U.S. Health System Reform
2016), while that same year, 1.6 million people enrolled mid-year via a special enrollment period (about 15% of the
number who joined during open enrollment) (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2016c). Together, these
data suggest at least a third of Marketplace enrollees are not enrolled for the full year.
6
Partial year enrollment in the Marketplaces can happen in two ways: first, individuals enroll during the annual
open enrollment period and drop Marketplace coverage during the year. Second, individuals have a mid-year
“qualifying life event” (e.g., loss of ESI) allowing them to enroll through a Special Enrollment Period (SEP)
(Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2016d; Hartman et al. 2015), which have been the source of adverse
selection concerns. Increased enforcement of eligibility for SEPs started in 2016 to avoid misuse or abuse of SEPs
by consumers (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2016d).

based on demographics such as age, sex, and enrollment type (e.g., whether institutionalized)
(Chen et al. 2015; Robst, Levy, and Ingber 2007). This means that plans retain incentives to
select for partial-year enrollees who are healthier, conditional on these limited variables.
However, when diagnosis-based risk adjustment is used for partial-year enrollees, the common
(and intuitive) method is what we term “fractional adjustment”. The partial-year enrollee’s
annual spending is predicted using the same algorithm as for full year enrollees, based on
diagnoses observed during the portion of the year they were enrolled. Then, for the partial-year
enrollee, the predicted spending is multiplied by the fraction of the year the enrollee is enrolled.
This method was originally used in the Marketplaces (which was then later tweaked, as we will
discuss). It also underlies many state Medicaid programs (Layton, Ndikumana, and Shepard
2017).7
We provide a model showing that the fractional adjustment method will systematically
underpredict spending for partial-year enrollees as compared to full-year enrollees with similar
true health status and usage patterns. The key intuition is that a diagnosis is more likely to be
missed for a partial-year enrollee, as there will be less time to accumulate provider encounters in
which a diagnosis might be coded for the health insurance claim. We call this the “missed
diagnosis” channel.8 Thus, whether a specific diagnosis (e.g., diabetes) is observed provides

7

State Medicaid managed care programs vary in many ways, including in the type of risk adjustment system they
use among managed care insurers. This variation is both across states and within states for different Medicaid
eligibility groups. For risk adjustment, states use systems such as the Chronic Disability Payment System or
Adjusted Clinical Groups to calculate an enrollee’s risk score. Many states require only 6 months of enrollment to
calculate a risk score for its Medicaid managed care enrollees. Enrollee risk scores are then used to contribute to an
aggregate plan-level average risk score or plans may be paid based on each individual’s risk score (See Layton,
Ndikumana, and Shepard 2017 for a discussion). A system that calculates an average risk score and then pays per
enrollee-month will look quite similar to fractional adjustment: the risk score will be underestimated for partial-year
enrollees.
8
Precisely, by “missed diagnoses,” we mean that the diagnosis would have been observed if the individual were
observed for the full year but is not observed during the partial year in which the individual is enrolled. We do not
take a stand on what the “correct” level of diagnostic coding should be, merely that it will be less intense for partialyear enrollees than for full year enrollees.

5

different information about a partial-year enrollee versus a full-year enrollee; all else equal,
partial-year enrollees for whom no diagnosis is observed are sicker on average than full-year
enrollees for whom no diagnosis is observed. We frame the model around risk adjustment for
health insurance, but it is also applicable to adjustment for quality metrics.
Using the model, we show how to correct the risk adjustment system to account for
missed diagnoses in partial-year enrollment. We propose scaling up payments for observed
diagnoses in partial-year enrollees to account for the fact that diagnoses are more likely to be
missed if an enrollee is observed for a shorter time period. This achieves the dual goals of
correctly compensating plans (on average) for both partial-year enrollees and sick enrollees. The
alternative policy of simply adding an additional fixed payment based on enrollment duration for
partial-year enrollees, as recently implemented in the Marketplaces, can correctly compensate for
partial-year enrollees on average, but will then make sick enrollees systematically
undercompensated. The intuition is that compensating using an additional fixed payment for all
partial-year enrollees leads to overpaying for healthy partial-year enrollees and underpaying for
truly sick partial-year enrollees. This can lead insurance companies to develop strategies to avoid
enrolling sicker enrollees as a result of the risk adjustment system failure.
Our result is innovative — we are unaware of a risk adjustment method that uses
diagnosis information to adjust for partial-year enrollment in this way—and provides a potential
solution for programs that have avoided using diagnosis data to risk adjust partial-year enrollees.
A commonly cited reason that risk adjustment systems do not use data from actual partial-year
enrollees is that sample sizes are too small to accurately calibrate the model for rare conditions
(Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Center for Consumer Information & Insurance
Oversight 2016a). Because the scaling factor in our model is determined based on the probability

6

the diagnosis is observed in the shorter versus longer observation period, simulations from data
on full-year enrollees will provide the necessary information for all conditions to correct
payments for partial year enrollees.
After presenting our theoretical model, we empirically examine the importance of missed
diagnoses in partial-year enrollment. We use the 2014 ACA Marketplace risk adjustment
algorithm and data on commercially insured working-age adults. We quantify underprediction of
spending due to missed diagnoses by conducting a simulation using data from full year enrollees:
if these individuals had been enrolled for only part of the year, how would their predicted
spending based on the risk adjustment algorithm compare to their actual spending for the months
they were enrolled? We find that six month enrollees’ predicted costs are only 81% of their
actual costs, while three month enrollees’ predicted costs are only 68% of their actual costs on
average. Based upon an average annual spending of $4,666 per enrollee, this means that the
spending of a six-month enrollees is underpredicted by $443 (calculated as 19% underprediction
* 0.5 years enrolled * $4,666 spending/year). Our results are consistent with concerns raised by
Marketplace insurers about being undercompensated for partial-year enrollees (Eyles and Gierer
2016; Fisher 2016), as well as with a report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services9 and subsequent adjustments to the Marketplace risk adjustment system for enrollment
duration (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2016b; Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services Center for Consumer Information & Insurance Oversight 2016a).
Our model and empirics also consider a second reason that risk adjustment may fail for
partial-year enrollees: partial-year enrollees may have systematically different spending patterns
than full year enrollees (“differential spending patterns”), even if no diagnoses are missed by the

risk adjustment algorithm. Differential spending patterns may result from factors that increase
utilization, including pent up demand, and factors that decrease utilization, such as higher out-ofpocket spending due to annual deductibles not being scaled to partial year enrollment.10 These
differential spending patterns can affect enrollee risk scores and the relationship between risk
scores and spending (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Center for Consumer
Information & Insurance Oversight 2016a). The differential spending channel can thus lead risk
adjustment to over- or under- compensate for partial-year enrollees on average, depending on the
utilization patterns of these enrollees.
In a second empirical analysis, we estimate the combined effect of missed diagnoses and
differential spending by examining the risk adjustment model’s performance on individuals who
were enrolled for only part of the year in the Marketscan data. In this partial year sample, the
differential spending channel has relatively small effects for six-month and three-month
enrollees, indicating that in this sample, utilization patterns are likely similar between full year
and partial year enrollees. For example, three month enrollees are predicted by the missed
diagnosis analysis to be 68% as costly as their actual spending. When both differential spending
and missed diagnoses are accounted for, results are similar: three month enrollees are predicted
to be 73% as costly as their actual spending. However, the effects of differential spending
patterns for one-month enrollees are larger: while the missed diagnoses predicts that they are
56% as costly as their actual spending, that number rises to 86% once differential spending is
accounted for. This result is sensible: one month enrollees don’t have much time to consume care

10

Partial year enrollees will typically spend a higher proportion of their enrollment duration exposed to deductibles
(Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Center for Consumer Information & Insurance Oversight 2016a;
Taubman et al. 2014). Plan parameters for deductibles and maximum out-of-pocket spending caps are based on
annual enrollment and are not prorated based on enrollment duration. Previous research has shown that individuals
are responsive to this difference in cost-sharing in their utilization patterns and have lower spending than would
otherwise be expected (Aron-Dine et al. 2015).

8

(e.g., it takes time to find an in-network doctor and make an appointment), as indicated by the
79% of one month enrollees who have no spending during the enrollment period.
The effect sizes we find for underprediction of spending for partial year enrollees are
substantial. By way of benchmarking, consider another noted failure of risk adjustment,
“upcoding”. Geruso and Layton (2015) show “upcoding” among Medicare Advantage insurers,
in which private plans code diagnoses more intensively than fee-for-service Medicare and thus
are overpaid. Individuals of similar underlying health status enrolled in private Medicare
Advantage plans have risk scores that are 6-16% higher than individuals in fee-for-service
Medicare (Geruso and Layton 2015). Geruso and Layton note that their 6% number is
“equivalent to 6% of all consumers in a market becoming paraplegic, 11% of all consumers
developing Parkinson’s disease, or 39% becoming diabetic”. Although this is based on Medicare
Advantage enrollees, a different population than the commercially insured working age adults
we examine empirically, this comparison is still informative as to the magnitude of the
underprediction due to failures of risk adjustment to account for partial year enrollment.
Undercompensating insurers for partial-year enrollees will lead them try to avoid such
enrollees. For example, one way to select against partial-year enrollees is through the use of high
deductibles.11 For instance, consider two plans with the same actuarial value, one with a high
deductible but low coinsurance rate, the other with a low deductible but high coinsurance rate.
Compared to similar full-year enrollees, partial-year enrollees will show a greater preference for
the low deductible plan, as they are less likely to be enrolled long enough to benefit from the
high deductible plan’s lower coinsurance rates. These incentives to discourage partial year

11

More generally, plans can try to select healthier enrollees using the design of cost-sharing provisions, drug
formularies, provider network composition, marketing and customer service, and/or avoiding certain regions or
states (Geruso, Layton, and Prinz 2016; Jacobs and Sommers 2015; McGuire et al. 2014; Montz et al. 2016; van de
Ven et al. 2015).

9

enrollees may have contributed to high deductibles seen in many Marketplace plans (Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services 2016a).
The framework we develop is novel12 and general enough to be used to improve risk
adjustment in the Marketplaces as well as other health insurance markets. It also highlights that
risk-adjusted quality measures will likely penalize providers who attract partial-year enrollees
unless appropriate adjustments are made. The distinction between the missed diagnosis channel
and the differential spending channel is important. Given that selection into partial-year
enrollment and resulting usage patterns of these enrollees will likely vary substantially between
different markets, differential spending results from one population are difficult to generalize to
other populations. However, the missed diagnosis effect is predictable and systematic. Moreover,
as our theory and empirical example shows, corrections for the missed diagnosis effect can be
made without actually having data on the partial year enrollees.
The paper proceeds as follows: In Section 2 we introduce theory that contains a model of
partial-year enrollment and missed diagnoses. It also formally defines the differential spending
channel. Section 3 describes our empirical methods, Section 4 shows the results, and Section 5
offers discussion and conclusion.
II.

THEORY

12

For instance, a report that estimated underpayment for partial-year enrollees based on Medicare fee-for-service
claims (Mehmud and Yi 2012) only examined the missed diagnoses channel; actual partial-year enrollees in that
population may also have differential spending patterns. Older research using 1994 data from three states described
the issues of short term enrollees being underpaid by diagnosis based risk adjustment and having more unpredictable
spending in select states for Medicaid managed care (Adams, Bronstein, and Raskind-Hood 2002). CMS CCIIO
described issues surrounding partial year enrollment and has introduced adjustment factors starting in calendar year
2017 to correct for enrollment duration (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2016b; Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services 2016d; Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Center for Consumer Information & Insurance
Oversight 2016a). Their analyses with MarketScan data found substantial underpayment for partial year enrollees;
however, they did not distinguish between the missed diagnoses effect and the differential spending pattern effect.

10

In this section, we develop a stylized model of diagnosis based risk adjustment and use it to
illustrate the effect of partial-year enrollment. The stylized model can represent many diagnosisbased risk adjustment systems that pay for partial-year enrollees, including those used in the
Marketplaces and in many states’ Medicaid managed care programs. We discuss the model in
terms of risk adjustment payments in health insurance, but it could also be applied to risk
adjustment for quality measures by interpreting the model as predicting the risk of complications.
Consider a simple diagnosis-based risk adjustment system in which an enrollee i’s
predicted annual spending 𝑦̂𝑖 is a linear combination of a fixed13 amount 𝛼 plus observed
diagnoses times a set of diagnosis-specific weights β.14 The diagnosis specific weights are the
expected additional spending due to each diagnosis, which are calibrated by the risk adjustment
system. That is, 𝑦̂𝑖 = 𝛼 + ∑𝐽𝑗=1 𝑥𝑖𝑗 𝛽𝑗 , where 𝑥𝑖𝑗 = 1 if the diagnosis j is observed for enrollee i
and 0 otherwise. Observing a diagnosis increases expected spending, so all 𝛽𝑗 > 0. A diagnosis
may be observed anytime during the year in which the enrollee is enrolled, whenever an enrollee
interacts with a healthcare provider and has a health insurance claim. We assume that the risk
adjustment system is accurately calibrated for full-year enrollees: that is, the average predicted
spending 𝑦̂ conditional on any diagnosis x is equal to the average actual spending 𝑦 conditional
on having that diagnosis. That is for any set of diagnoses, 𝐸[𝑦̂|{𝑥𝑗 }∈𝐽 ] = 𝐸[𝑦|{𝑥𝑗 }∈𝐽 ].
Now, consider a partial-year enrollee i who has the same underlying unobserved health
status and usage patterns as the full year enrollee. Let 𝜑𝑖 ∈ (0,1] be the fraction of the year that a

Risk adjustment systems in practice may also make use of other data, such as enrollees’ age, sex, or actuarial
value of plan selected. That is, both 𝛼 and the 𝛽𝑗 could vary by those characteristics. We abstract from those issues
in this model, which do not affect our results. However, in our empirical section, we deal with them appropriately.
14
In our model, the outcome is predicted spending of individuals. In practice, a risk adjustment system often
predicts a risk score that is translated to insurer payments/transfers that also includes adjustments for factors such
premiums, plan cost-sharing features/actuarial values, and geographic corrections. We abstract away from those
concerns in the model.
13

11

given enrollee i is enrolled in the health plan and thus observed by the risk adjustment system.
We assume that the probability a diagnosis is observed is strictly increasing in the fraction of the
year enrolled.15 We formally define two terms relevant for partial-year enrollees: fractional
adjustment and spending scales linearly in time enrolled.
Fractional adjustment is an intuitive method that attempts to account for partial year
enrollment:
Definition 1: Fractional Adjustment. A risk adjustment system uses fractional
adjustment if the predicted spending for an individual enrolled for fraction 𝜑𝑖 of the year
is 𝜑𝑖 (𝛼 + ∑𝐽𝑗=1 𝑥𝑖𝑗 𝛽𝑗 ). That is, a risk adjustment system uses fractional adjustment if it
predicts annual spending and then multiplies by the fraction of year enrolled 𝜑𝑖 .
The assumption that spending scales linearly in time enrolled captures the claim that partial-year
enrollees are the “same as” full-year enrollees, just enrolled for a shorter time:
Definition 2: Spending Scales Linearly In Time Enrolled. For any individual i, if their
annual spending is 𝑦𝑖 when enrolled for the full-year, their expected spending is 𝜑𝑖 𝑦𝑖 if
they are enrolled for fraction 𝜑𝑖 of the year.
We view the assumption that spending scales linearly in time enrolled as a reasonable starting
point if the underlying health status of partial year enrollees is the same as full year enrollees and
spending patterns are similar. However, it may fail. We term the failure of this assumption
“differential spending” of partial-year enrollees. It is quick to see that when this assumption fails,
fractional adjustment would not generally compensate plans correctly for partial-year enrollees,

15

The assumption that each diagnosis is observed with lower probability for partial-year enrollees rules out cases in
which “diabetes with complications” is observed with lower probability but “diabetes without complications” is
observed with higher probability. These types of situations can be accommodated in the model by the weaker
assumption that on average, partial-year enrollees of identical health status and usage patterns as full year enrollees
are observed to be healthier on average, in the sense that E[∑𝐽𝑗=1 𝑥𝑗 𝛽𝑗 ] is lower for partial-year enrollees. We
present the simpler model for conciseness.

12

even if all their diagnoses are properly observed during the shorter time period. There are a
number of reasons that this assumption might fail, including pent-up demand (if partial-year
enrollees were previously uninsured) and differential exposure to cost-sharing (partial-year
enrollees likely spending a longer fraction of the year exposed to the deductible).
What is perhaps more surprising is that even if spending is linear in time enrolled,
fractional adjustment is still not the correct strategy for addressing partial-year enrollment. The
following proposition shows that fractional adjustment will in fact underpredict the spending of
partial-year enrollees. The proof develops a simple single diagnosis example that explains the
logic.
Proposition 1: Missed Diagnoses Leads to Underpayment. Suppose the risk
adjustment system is accurately calibrated for full-year enrollees and that spending scales
linearly in time enrolled. Then, fractional adjustment will underpredict spending for
partial-year enrollees on average: for 𝜑𝑖 < 1, 𝐸[𝜑𝑦̂] < 𝐸[𝜑𝑦].

Proof: Consider a system that is only based on a single diagnosis, so that predicted
annual spending is 𝛼 without the diagnosis and 𝛼 + 𝛽 with the diagnosis. Call an
individual who gets the diagnosis when enrolled for the full-year “sick” and who does not
get the diagnosis when enrolled for the full-year “healthy.” A healthy individual does not
get the diagnosis when enrolled for either the full or partial-year, as the probability of
observing a diagnosis increases in time enrolled. Fractional adjustment is accurate for
healthy individuals: predicted and expected actual spending are 𝜑𝛼.

13

However, sick enrollees with predicted annual spending of 𝛼 + 𝛽 only have the diagnosis
observed with probability p<1 when enrolled for part of the year. If the diagnosis is
observed, fractional adjustment again performs accurately: predicted and expected actual
spending are 𝜑(𝛼 + 𝛽). However, if the diagnosis for the sick individual is missed,
predicted spending is only 𝜑𝛼, which is less than the expected actual spending of 𝜑(𝛼 +
𝛽). As a result, the risk-adjustment system with a single diagnosis underpredicts on
average for partial-year enrollees. The logic generalizes for a system that is the sum of
many diagnoses, under the assumptions that all 𝛽𝑗 > 0 and that the probability a
diagnosis is observed is strictly increasing in the fraction of the year enrolled ■

Figure 1 illustrates the intuition behind the proof. Consider two individuals with the same
condition who both receive a diagnosis in a February doctor’s visit, and assume that this is the
only time the diagnosis could be observed that year. Take one individual who is enrolled in the
plan for a spell between January and June. In this case, the diagnosis is observed, and the
fractional adjustment method will be correct with predicted spending of 𝜑(𝛼 + 𝛽). However,
consider the second individual enrolled for a spell from July to December. Although this
individual has the same underlying condition, the plan does not observe the diagnosis from the
February visit. The individual’s predicted spending is only 𝜑𝛼, which is below their true
spending of 𝜑(𝛼 + 𝛽). This “sick” enrollee has a missed diagnosis and their spending is underpredicted.
Note that on average, the risk adjustment system correctly compensates for “healthy”
partial-year enrollees who would not have had a diagnosis observed, even if they were enrolled

14

for the full year. For these “healthy” enrollees, there is no diagnosis to miss. Their spending is
𝜑𝛼, equal to what is predicted by fractional adjustment.
[FIGURE 1 HERE]
How then should risk adjustment be altered to account for partial-year enrollees? Table 1
examines the case of a single diagnosis and compares three systems: fractional adjustment alone
and two modifications to fractional adjustment – an “additive payment” and a “scale up
diagnosis payment”. The first proposed modification for partial year enrollees is a system in
which an additional payment c for partial-year enrollees is added over and above the amount
implied by fractional adjustment. The payment c is based on the number of months enrolled and
does not vary based on patient characteristics or observed diagnoses. This proposal to adjust risk
scores using an additive factor was adopted in recent revisions to the risk adjustment program for
the Marketplaces starting in the 2017 calendar year for risk adjustment (Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services 2016b).16 In contrast, the second (preferred) method is novel: we propose
scaling-up the diagnosis specific payments (𝛽) for partial year enrollees, based on the inverse of
p, which is the probability a diagnosis that would be observed for the full-year enrollee is
actually observed for the partial-year enrollee.
[TABLE 1 HERE]
The first column of Table 1 shows that the overall payment for sick enrollees under
fractional adjustment is 𝜑[𝛼 + 𝑝𝛽], which is below their true costs. The second column shows
that if c is chosen so that partial-year enrollees are correctly compensated on average, then

16

The additive payment model is very similar to proposals that would estimate an entirely separate risk adjustment
model for partial-year enrollees. Having an additive payment c is equivalent estimating a different 𝛼 in the model.
Note for the model presented here, an entirely separate partial-year risk adjustment model would produce the same
estimated payments per diagnosis 𝛽 (recall that here, conditional on observing a diagnosis, the risk adjustment
system is accurate for partial-year enrollees).

15

healthy partial-year enrollees will be over-compensated for and sick partial-year enrollees will be
under-compensated for. Thus, the additive payment c cannot be chosen to correctly compensate
insurers for both healthy and sick partial-year enrollees. The third column shows our proposed
method for correction. Instead of making a payment 𝛽 for the diagnosis, the system makes a
higher payment of 𝑝1 𝛽, where 𝑝 < 1. That is, the third method scales up the payment for partial
year enrollees’ observed diagnoses to account for the lower probability of observing those
diagnoses, relative to a full year enrollee. This then correctly compensates for both healthy and
sick partial-year enrollees.
For multiple diagnoses, one would need to adjust by 1/𝑝𝑗 for each diagnosis based on the
probability that diagnosis j is observed among partial-year enrollees. Also note that the
probabilities 𝑝𝑗 also depend on the fraction of the year enrolled 𝜑. That is, the probability a
diagnosis is observed will generally differ between a one-month versus six-month enrollee.
The scaling- up method has advantages: of the three methods considered, it is the only
one that removes the incentives for insurers to distort contracts and services to avoid the sick
enrollees. However, the method also brings with it complications. While it removes the
incentives to select for or against sick enrollees, it increases the incentives for insurers attract and
code the diagnoses for sick partial-year enrollees. Thus, it will need to be recalibrated as firms
change their coding intensity. Moreover, by increasing the variance in payments, it may create
more scope for insurers to cherry-pick enrollees who are “cheap” for their risk score (see e.g.,
Brown et al. (2014)). In general, a risk adjustment system must tradeoff the removal of
incentives for service-level selection against other concerns such as statistical fit (e.g. R2),
incentives for cost-containment (i.e. power), and balance in incentives across different services;
for a discussion, see Geruso and McGuire (2016).

III.

EMPIRICAL EXAMPLE: METHODS

The theory model illuminates the role of missed diagnosis and differential spending in risk
adjustment for partial-year enrollees. We now ask the question, how important are each of these
factors empirically? Additionally, how much does the explanatory power vary for partial year
enrollees? We take as our empirical example the risk adjustment algorithm used for the ACA
Marketplaces. Since claims data are unavailable for the Marketplaces, we apply the algorithm to
data on a similar population that is used for calibrating this risk adjustment algorithm:
commercially insured working age enrollees included in Truven MarketScan data. MarketScan
data are used in the Marketplaces to calculate risk adjustment models and partial year adjustment
factors.17

III.A. Risk Adjustment Algorithm
We applied the HHS risk adjustment algorithm used on the federally facilitated and statebased Marketplaces (version 03) for benefit year 2014 (Department of Health and Human
Services 2013). The risk adjustment algorithm predicts an enrollee risk score based on diagnosis
categories. We applied the algorithm to calculate risk scores based on claims from different time
periods as described below. Based on the algorithm, we limited to inpatient hospital, outpatient
facility, and professional claims to calculate risk scores (Kautter et al. 2014).

CMS explains their use of Marketscan, saying that while “many projected characteristics of the individual market
enrollees were similar to those of both enrollees in employer-sponsored insurance and Medicaid enrollees, on
average they tended to be closer to enrollees in employer-sponsored insurance” (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services Center for Consumer Information & Insurance Oversight 2016a). In future years, starting as early as 2019,
they plan to use data from the individual and small group market to calibrate the model although they note they do
not have evidence that using Marketscan is less accurate (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Center for
Consumer Information & Insurance Oversight 2016b).
17

17

The algorithm used International Classification of Diseases – Ninth Edition (ICD-9)
diagnostic codes and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) procedure codes to create
hierarchical condition categories (HCCs). Codes were then ranked by severity, and patients
assigned to their highest severity condition within that condition category. Risk scores were
assigned based on these 127 binary HCC indicators plus age and sex variables (Kautter et al.
2014).
In the Marketplaces, these risk scores are averaged across plans for an insurer to calculate
risk transfers (Kautter et al. 2014). Insurers whose enrollees have lower predicted spending based
on risk scores make risk transfer payments, while insurers whose enrollees have higher predicted
spending based on risk scores receive payments, for an overall market net transfer amount of
zero.18 Risk transfers account for plan enrollee composition, measured by risk scores based on
diagnosis and demographic characteristics; adjustments are also made for geographic cost
variations and plan actuarial values (Pope et al. 2014).
The algorithm adjusted risk scores for insurance plan coverage using metal levels – for
example, an individual with identical characteristics and condition categories in a “gold” plan
with an actuarial value of 80% would be predicted to have a higher risk score and associated
costs than the same individual enrolled in a “silver” plan with an actuarial value of 70%
(Department of Health and Human Services 2013). We assigned all individuals to the “silver”
risk score with no cost sharing reductions. We conducted sensitivity analyses for other metal
levels: bronze, gold, and platinum.
III.B. Data

18

We do not address two other transitional policies were implemented in the Marketplaces: risk corridors and
reinsurance. These policies were temporary for 2014-2016, while risk adjustment is permanent.

18

We used the 2013 Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and
Encounters database, containing information from almost 100 payers, including commercial
insurance companies and self-insured employers. Enrollment data were combined with complete
claims information. Total spending included inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy claims.
Analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.0 (SAS Corporation; Cary, NC) and Stata
version 14.1 (StataCorp; College Station, TX).
III.C. Analytic Samples
We constructed two analytic samples. The “full year sample” was adults aged 21-64
continuously enrolled for the 2013 calendar year. We limited to individuals with complete
demographic information, prescription drug coverage, integrated mental health/substance abuse
coverage, who did not have capitated payments, and who had non-negative spending for the full
period. We included those in all types of insurance plans. The “partial year sample” included
adults aged 21-64 enrolled for at least 1 day and fewer than 365 days in 2013, with the same
restrictions as the full year sample.
III.D. Missed Diagnoses Alone Analysis
To determine the effect of missed diagnoses, we conducted simulations of partial year
enrollment. Using the full year sample, we simulated three shorter enrollment periods: what if
each enrollee had only been enrolled for six months? For three months? For one month? These
simulated enrollment periods were created by breaking up the full year into non-overlapping
periods. For example, when simulating three-month enrollment periods, each enrollee produced
four different simulated periods (i.e., Quarters 1, 2, 3, and 4 of 2013). For each of the shorter
enrollment periods, we calculated risk scores from that period’s data and calculated total
spending from claims during that period. This method isolates the missed diagnosis effect to

19

quantify how much risk adjustment might underpredict the spending of partial-year enrollees
with identical underlying health status and usage patterns. Simulating shorter enrollment periods
affects what risk scores will be calculated because all diagnoses may not be included on the
specific claims during this period, but is not affected by other factors such as the higher costsharing experienced by partial year enrollees or changes in sample composition.
We estimated a regression to convert risk scores to annual spending in order to calculate
predictive ratios as described below.19 Thus, the average annual risk score predicts the average
annual spending for the full year sample; we used this to compare to actual spending in the
simulated shorter durations as described below.
annual spending = β0 + β1 annual risk score

(Eqn 1)

For partial-year enrollees, we implement fractional adjustment—the risk adjustment system for
the ACA Marketplaces before the addition of adjustment factors for enrollment duration. For a
member enrolled d days out of the year, we estimated risk scored days based on claims observed
during d days of the year. The actual number of days in each observed period is used for the
calculations (e.g., second quarter 2013 has 91 days). We then simulated predicted spending using
fractional adjustment as follows:
𝑑

Predicted spendingd days = 365(β0 + β1 risk scored days)

(Eqn 2)

where coefficients β0 and β1 come from Equation 1.
For each duration of one month, three months, six months, and 12 months, we calculate
the “predictive ratio” as mean predicted spendingd days/ mean actual spending d days. We averaged
the predicted period spending based on the period risk score and compared to the averaged actual

19

In individual and small group markets (including the Marketplaces), the risk transfer formula scales plan risk
scores to spending levels using information about statewide premiums, which reflect statewide cost levels (Pope et
al.). Here, we use actual costs in our population. Premiums may diverge from costs: see Mahoney and Weyl
(Forthcoming) and Ericson and Starc (2015) for more on imperfect competition in selection markets.

20

period spending. If the risk score predicts spending perfectly on average, the predictive ratio
would be 1 (Kautter et al. 2012; Kautter et al. 2014).
We also calculated the explanatory power for each time period by estimating a regression
of spending during the time period (e.g., one month) on the risk score calculated for that period.
The explanatory power, measured by the R-squared, is the amount of variation in spending
explained by the risk score. All else equal, higher explanatory power is better, since risk
adjustment systems with more residual variation in spending create more scope for insurers to
cherry-pick enrollees who are “cheap” for their risk score (see e.g., Brown et al. (2014)).
We calculated the proportion of enrollees who had no inpatient, outpatient, or
pharmaceutical spending during each period. We also measured out-of-pocket spending by
totaling all forms of cost-sharing (e.g., copay, deductible) and calculating this as a proportion of
total spending.
II.E. Partial-Year Enrollment Analysis: Differential Spending + Missed Diagnosis
While the simulations described in the previous section, “Missed Diagnoses Alone,” will
show the effects of missed diagnoses due to only being observed part of the year, we also
examine the combined effect of differential spending patterns and missed diagnoses for partial
year enrollees. We use the partial year sample, comprised of individuals enrolled for less than a
full year, to examine spending patterns and risk scores.
We analyzed differences in demographics, spending patterns, and risk scores between
partial year and full year samples. We compared per member per month spending, out of pocket
spending as a percent of total spending, and the percent of enrollees with no spending during the
period. We also compared spending patterns and risk scores to those calculated in the missed
diagnoses alone analysis.

21

We then calculated the predictive ratio by number of months enrolled by using a similar
process as described previously. We used Equation 1, with coefficients estimated on the full year
sample, to calculate predicted annual spending for each enrollee. We then calculated each
enrollee’s predicted spending based on days enrolled using Equation 2. For each number of
months enrolled, we calculated the predictive ratio by averaging predicted period spending
compared to the averaged actual period spending for those enrolled for that duration.20

IV. EMPIRICAL RESULTS
IV.A. Missed Diagnoses Alone Analysis
1. Descriptive Statistics. The full year sample had 13,069,722 enrollees continuously
enrolled in the same plan for 2013. Descriptive statistics showed an average age of 43.8 with
slightly more females (52.4%) (Table 2). The average silver risk score for the full year sample
was 1.28; these individuals were predicted to be 28% more costly than the average plan liability
expenditure for the calibration sample (Kautter et al. 2014; Kautter, Pope, and Keenan 2014). 21
The average annual medical spending for 2013 was $4,666.
[TABLE 2 HERE]
2. Simulation Analysis. Simulations with the full year sample showed the predictive ratio
varied substantially with enrollment duration, with lower ratios for shorter periods (Table 3); the
predictive ratio for one month was 0.56, and for six months was 0.81. A predictive ratio of 0.56
indicates that the predicted spending based on risk scores for simulated one month enrollees was
56% of actual medical spending for these enrollees.

20

We categorized into number of months enrolled by calculating number of days enrolled, dividing by 30.4, and
rounding to the nearest number of months.
21
The calibration sample uses MarketScan data and contains both full and partial year enrollees. It was designed to
be representative of individuals enrolling in the small group and individual market.

22

[TABLE 3 HERE]
Risk scores had low to moderate explanatory power that varied substantially over time periods
(Table 3), with a one year period having almost twice the explanatory power as a one month
period (0.34 vs. 0.19). That is, for the simulated one month period, 19% of the variation in
spending was explained by variation in risk scores.
III.B. Partial Year Enrollment Analysis: Differential Spending + Missed Diagnosis
1. Descriptive Statistics. There were 7,601,091 partial year enrollees, slightly more than
half the number of full year enrollees. These enrollees had an average enrollment duration of 5.2
months (Table 2). The average silver risk score ranged from 0.59 for those enrolled zero to three
months to 1.07 for those enrolled nine to fewer than 12 months. Shorter enrollment durations had
more males enrolled than females, with shorter enrollment durations also having younger
enrollees.
2. Partial Year Comparisons to Full Year Sample. To understand differential spending
patterns, we compared spending for partial year enrollees versus full year enrollees and the
simulated shorter periods. Partial year spending during the enrollment period was lower for all
periods for actual partial year enrollees versus simulated full year enrollees, as was per month
spending (Table 4). For one-month actual partial year enrollees, per month spending was $215,
compared to $389 for simulated one month enrollees. For each enrollment duration, the
percentage of enrollees with no spending during the enrollment period was higher for actual
partial year enrollees than simulated enrollees for the same period; for one month, 79% of one
month actual partial year enrollees did not have spending during the month versus 66% of
simulated enrollees. Out of pocket spending was generally lower for the full year simulated

23

enrollees versus partial year enrollees, although for the three month enrollees, simulated
enrollees had higher out of pocket spending.
[Table 4 HERE]
3. Partial Year Predictive Ratio Analysis. We calculated predictive ratios for partial year
enrollees using regression estimates from the full year sample, and compared these to the
predictive ratios calculated in the full year simulations. For one and three month durations, the
predictive ratios were higher for partial year enrollees than simulated enrollees. For six month
and one-year durations, the predictive ratios were higher for simulated enrollees than partial year
enrollees.
[TABLE 5 HERE]
We repeated all analyses for the other three metal levels and found similar results.
V. DISCUSSION
We provide a framework for why risk adjustment will not work properly for partial-year
enrollees: missed diagnoses and differential spending patterns. Distinguishing between these two
effects is important for improving risk adjustment models. Our model shows that the standard
method of fractional adjustment will lead risk adjustment to underpredict spending for partialyear enrollees, relative to similar full-year enrollees. This results from the missed diagnoses
channel, and is a general point that applies to many markets—it is not merely a failure to
calibrate the risk adjustment model correctly, but a fundamental consequence of the fractional
adjustment approach to risk adjustment.
The magnitude of the underprediction of spending is substantial using data for enrollees who
are similar to those enrolled in the Marketplaces. The missed diagnosis channel alone will lead to
underprediction for shorter enrollment durations, even if partial-year enrollees are not any sicker

24

than full-year enrollees, there is no pent-up demand effect, and partial year enrollees have similar
overall cost-sharing as full year enrollees. The intuition for this finding is that insurers are not
compensated by risk transfers for the additional costs of enrollees whose diagnoses are missed
due to partial year enrollment. These enrollees, however, continue to have spending
commensurate with their underlying (unobserved) health status and usage patterns. We also
show that risk scores have lower explanatory power for partial-year enrollees; they do not
explain as much of the variation in costs for these enrollees, leaving scope for additional risk
selection (see Brown et al. (2014)).
We then considered another channel for why risk adjustment might fail—systematically
different spending patterns for partial year versus full year enrollees. The “differential spending
patterns + missed diagnoses” analysis of 6-month and shorter partial-year enrollees showed they
had lower per month spending than full-year enrollees simulated over the same time periods,
meaning the spending of partial-year enrollees was systematically different than full-year
enrollees. In calculating predictive ratios with the partial year risk scores, we find differential
spending partially offsets the missed diagnosis effect, but still leaves a substantial
underprediction for partial-year enrollees.
Due to the fact that we do not have claims of actual Marketplace enrollees, partial year
enrollees in the Marketplaces may differ from those in Marketscan. For example, they may be
more likely to be previously uninsured and may also face different levels of cost-sharing. As a
result, the differential spending channel may be different empirically in the Marketplaces.
Differential spending of partial year enrollees in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed
care is likely to be quite different than those in commercial insurance, showing the importance of

25

our theoretical model in noting a way to fix risk adjustment for partial year enrollees without
relying on data for these enrollees, which may be problematic due to small samples.
Our theoretical results also show how to fix the risk adjustment formula such that it accounts
for the missed diagnosis effect: scale up the payments for a diagnosis in partial-year enrollees to
account for the fact that the diagnosis will be missed. This adjustment is quite different than the
additive partial-year adjustment factors implemented in revisions to the Marketplace risk
adjustment model, which are right on average but create additional incentives for insurers to
avoid sicker partial year enrollees. The scaling method is more complex than the additive factor
in that it requires the estimating how observing an enrollee for a shorter duration affects the
probability the diagnosis would be observed. However, this probability should be simulated from
data on full-year enrollees, reducing concerns about having small sample sizes for partial year
enrollees with relatively rare (and often expensive) conditions.
An alternative to scaling up diagnosis payments in diagnosis-based risk adjustment might be
a more radical revision of the risk adjustment model itself. Many commentators have proposed
using prescription drug claims in a risk adjustment model, as including prescription claims adds
substantial predictive power (e.g. Layton, Geruso, and Prinz (2016) on the Marketplaces, and
Hsu et al. (2009) on Medicare Part D). Drugs taken regularly for a chronic illness might be
observed more frequently than office-visits for that illness, and thus reduce the missed diagnosis
problem for partial year enrollees. Although using prescription drug utilization in the risk
adjustment model for the Marketplaces has been criticized as being open to gaming and perverse
incentives for insurers (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Center for Consumer
Information & Insurance Oversight 2016a), CMS is planning to incorporate such information to
the risk adjustment for the Marketplace to improve the predictive ability starting in 2018

26

(Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2016b). Future research should explore whether the
addition of information from prescription drug utilization to risk adjustment systems improves
predictions for partial year enrollees as well as for full year enrollees.
We have focused on predicting the spending of enrollees, but insurers’ costs will diverge
from enrollees’ spending due to cost sharing. In some markets (e.g. Medicaid Managed Care),
cost-sharing is small in magnitude. But in others (e.g. bronze Marketplace plans), cost-sharing
can be substantial. In these cases, adjustment for the differential cost-sharing borne by partialyear enrollees should be incorporated into a risk transfer system. However, such an adjustment
should depend on the design of the insurance plan, rather than simply be based on actuarial
value. Consider two plans with the same actuarial value (for the entire population): a plan with a
high deductible and a plan with no deductible but high copays per-visit and per-admission. In the
high-deductible plan, cost-sharing is front-loaded in the year, and partial-year enrollees will pay
a higher fraction of their spending out-of-pocket than full-year enrollees will, thereby lowering
their costs to the insurer. But in the no-deductible, high-copay plan, cost-sharing is spread
throughout the year, so full-year and partial-year enrollees will pay similar fractions of spending
out of pocket. Thus, any partial-year enrollment correction for cost-sharing must consider not
just actuarial value but the structure of plan design.
Failures of risk adjustment can have substantial impacts on both firm profits and consumer
welfare. This is true, even if partial-year enrollees were equally allocated across insurers, and
even though risk adjustment payments are revenue neutral. This is due to the fact that errors in
risk adjustment will lead to contract distortion as insurers seek to avoid less profitable

27

enrollees.22 In this context, higher deductibles (holding fixed a plan’s actuarial value) are useful
to deter partial-year enrollees from enrolling. This distorts the contract away from what might be
optimal for both consumer welfare and firm profitability (i.e., both full-year enrollees and firms
might be better off with plan with lower deductibles in the absence of wanting to avoid partialyear enrollees).
Moreover, risk adjustment may interact with imperfect competition. Premiums are likely
marked up over cost in the Marketplaces and other contexts. In that case, even if partial-year
enrollees are underpaid relative to full-year enrollees, they may still be paid above cost.23
Changes to a revenue-neutral risk adjustment system can affect profits with imperfect
competition, even if each firm winds up enrolling an equal share of partial-year enrollees. For
instance, Ericson and Starc (2015) show that insurer profits are affected by regulations that
change the cost of the marginal enrollee. They examined modified community rating regulations
that linked the premiums for the old and the young, but a similar logic applies to risk adjustment
regulations, given that firms must charge the same monthly premium to full and partial-year
enrollees. Depending on whether partial-year enrollees are more or less sensitive to premiums
than full-year enrollees, underpaying for partial-year enrollees could lower or raise firm profits;
we do not have the data necessary to run the simulations that would answer this question.
We have focused on the implications for risk adjustment in insurance payments. Risk
adjusted quality benchmarks also underlie many important payment formulas in health care. The

22

See, for instance, Geruso, Layton, and Prinz (2016) for how formulary design responds to other errors in
Marketplace risk adjustment system, and Carey (2017) for how formulary design in Medicare Part D responds to
errors in risk adjustment induced by technological change.
23
The ACA requires that the Medical Loss Ratio be at least 80% for the individual and small group market. So for a
firm with maximum markups, six-month enrollees (whose spending we find to be underpredicted based on missed
diagnoses by 19%) may be on the margin of being profitable or unprofitable. The extent of insurer underpayment
due to underprediction of risk scores for partial year enrollees will depend on differential cost-sharing for partial
year enrollees and the size of risk transfer payments relative to insurer spending on enrollees.

28

same missed diagnosis channel that leads to underprediction for partial-year enrollees in health
insurance also will lead individuals who are observed for less than a full year to appear healthier
than they actually are. Thus, providers that disproportionately attract partial-year enrollees may
appear to have more complications than would be justified by their underlying patients’ health
status. Future work could estimate both the magnitude of the problem and propose solutions for
different provider quality benchmarks using the framework in this paper.
