    "abstract": "\n\nA great deal of empirical evidence shows that a country's production structure and productivity growth depend on its own R&D capital formation.  With the growing role of international trade, foreign investment and international knowledge diffusion, domestic production and productivity also depend on the R&D activities of other countries.  The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the bilateral link between the U.S. and Japanese economies in terms of how R&D capital formation in one country affects the production structure, physical and R&D capital accumulation, and productivity growth in the other country. We find that production processes become less labor intensive as international R&D spillovers grow.  In the short-run, R&D intensity is complementary to the international spillover.  This relationship persists in the long-run for the U.S., but the Japanese decrease their own R&D intensity.  U.S. R&D capital accounts for 60% of Japanese total factor productivity growth, while Japanese R&D capital contributes 20% to U.S. productivity gains.  International spillovers cause social rates of return to be about four times the private returns.\n\n",
