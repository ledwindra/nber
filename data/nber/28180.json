    "abstract": "\n\nIn this paper, we examine the effect of computer-assisted learning on students\u2019 long-term development. We explore the implementation of the \u201clargest ed-tech intervention in the world to date,\u201d which connected China\u2019s best teachers to more than 100 million rural students through satellite internet. We find evidence that exposure to the program improved students\u2019 academic achievement, labor performance, and computer usage. We observe these effects up to ten years after program implementation. These findings indicate that education technology can have long-lasting positive effects on a variety of outcomes and can be effective in reducing the rural\u2013urban education gap.\n\n",
