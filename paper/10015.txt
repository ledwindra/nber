ABSTRACT
Dollarization, in a broad sense, is increasingly a defining characteristic of many emerging market
economies. How important is this trend quantitatively and how important is it for the conduct of
monetary policy and the choice of exchange rate regimes? Though these questions have become a
hot topic in both the theory and policy literature, most efforts are remarkably uninformed by
evidence, in no small part because meaningful data has been lacking, except for a very narrow range
of assets. This paper attempts to move the discussion forward and shed light on the critical questions
by proposing a measure of dollarization that is broad both conceptually and in terms of country
coverage. We use this measure to identify trends in the evolution of dollarization in the developing
world in the last two decades, and to ascertain the consequences that dollarization has had on the
effectiveness of monetary and exchange rate policy. We find that, contrary to the general
presumption in the literature, a high degree of dollarization does not seem to be an obstacle to
monetary control or to disinflation. A level of dollarization does, however, appear to increase
exchange rate pass-through, reinforcing the claim that "fear of floating" is a greater problem for
highly dollarized economies. We also review the developing countries' record in combating their
addiction to dollars. Concretely, we try to explain why some countries have been able to avoid
certain forms of the addiction, and examine the evidence on successful de-dollarization.

I. INTRODUCTION
Dollarization, in a broad sense, is increasingly a defining characteristic of many
emerging market economies. Governments often borrow in dollars, individuals can hold
dollar- denominated bank accounts, firms and households can borrow in dollars both
domestically and from abroad. How important is this trend quantitatively and what are its
implications for the conduct of monetary policy and the choice of exchange rate regimes?
For those countries that wish they weren't so dollarized; how easy is to scale back? These
questions have received a great deal of attention in both the theory and policy literature.
Most of the answers thus far, however, have not been too convincing. Competing definitions
of dollarization and, most importantly, lack of empirical support for the various hypotheses
advanced have conspired against the emergence of anything resembling a consensus.
This paper attempts to move the debate forward and shed light on the critical
questions. We propose a measure of dollarization that is broad both conceptually and in
terms of country coverage. We use this measure to identify trends in the evolution of
dollarization in the developing world in the last two decades, and to ascertain the
consequences that dollarization has had on the effectiveness of monetary and exchange rate
policy. We find that, contrary to the general presumption in the literature, a high degree of
dollarization does not seem to be an obstacle to monetary control or to disinflation.
Dollarization does, however, appear to increase exchange rate pass-through, reinforcing the
claim that "fear of floating" is a greater problem for highly dollarized economies.

We then review the developing countries’ record in combating their addiction to
dollars. We try to explain why some countries have been able to avoid certain forms of the
addiction, and examine the evidence on successful de-dollarization. We find that this record
is not particularly encouraging; concretely, we are able to identify only two countries, out of
a total of 85, that managed to achieve large and lasting declines in domestic dollarization
without having to incur heavy costs in terns of financial disintermediation or capital flight.
II. WHAT IS A DOLLARIZED ECONOMY?
The definition of a dollarized economy has become quite elusive in recent years. For
more than two decades up to the late 1990s the defining feature of a dollarized economy was
the fact that domestic residents held foreign currency or financial assets denominated in
foreign currency as part of their asset portfolio. After the Asia crises of the late 1990s,
however, the term dollarization—and dollarized economy—started to be used by many to
refer to the case of countries that did not issue a national currency, or that opted to replace
their national currency for a foreign, more stable, one.2 At about the same time a different
strand of literature developed the concept of liability dollarization, stressing the role that
foreign currency borrowing by the private and public sectors had on the vulnerability of
emerging market economies to external shocks and, hence, on key aspects of macroeconomic
management.3
Terminology aside, it is relatively straightforward, both conceptually and empirically,

to establish a meaningful distinction between economies that do not have a national currency
and those where dollarization is only of a partial nature. Distinguishing between the two
other “types” of dollarization, however, is a much harder task. One reason for this is that,
broadly speaking, the two concepts of dollarization focus on different sides of the balance
sheet. Related complications are that the data used in empirical studies to gauge the presence
and/or macroeconomic effects of either concept of partial dollarization have serious
measurement problems, and that studies typically neglect the possible co-existence of both
phenomena.
Figure 1 helps illustrate the severity of these problems. The figure depicts the foreign
currency assets and liabilities of the private and public sector in a partially dollarized
economy. The four boxes in the upper left corner of the figure, the foreign currency assets of
households and firms, are the subject of analysis of the traditional literature on partial
dollarization. The newer literature on liability dollarization, by contrast, is primarily
concerned with entries on the right-side column; concretely, about the external foreign
currency liabilities of households, firms, and the government.
Lack of reliable data on the various foreign currency assets and liabilities depicted in
the figure have constrained the measures of dollarization used in the empirical studies related
to both strands of literature. The traditional literature on partial dollarization, for example,
has adopted as a norm the use of foreign currency deposits in domestic banks—typically as a
ratio to some other monetary aggregate—as the “best” indicator of dollarization.4 Severe data

In terms of the figure, this means that the standard measure of dollarization in the empirical
literature typically relies only on the foreign currency assets of domestic residents that are
indicated in the two boxes with striped borders.

shortcomings have repeatedly thwarted attempts to construct a reliable measure of partial
dollarization that includes estimates of the other three foreign currency assets held by

households and firms in partially dollarized economies—including, importantly, cash
holdings of foreign currency.5
The problems with which the nascent empirical literature on liability dollarization is
confronted are at least as serious. Sectoral data on the foreign currency liabilities of different
economic agents, and on the linkages across the balance sheets of those agents, are simply
not available for the large majority of countries (see Allen et al. (2002)). The few empirical
studies on liability dollarization that exist have therefore relied on indirect measures (such as
the “pass-through” from the exchange rate to prices) rather than on quantity-based estimates
of external foreign currency liabilities to gather support for their key hypotheses.6
III. AN ENCOMPASSING MEASURE OF PARTIAL DOLLARIZATION
A key objective of this paper is to take advantage of, and shed light on, the
interconnection between the two competing concepts of partial dollarization. To this effect,
we define a partially dollarized economy as one where households and firms hold a fraction
of their portfolio (inclusive of money balances) in foreign currency assets and/or where the
private and public sector have debts denominated in foreign currency.7 This purposely broad
definition covers the majority of economies in the world, as it excludes a priori only those
5

The reliance on measures of dollarization that exclude cash holdings of foreign currency
has created a serious disconnect between the theoretical concept of currency substitution that
sparked the early empirical studies on dollarization and the findings of these studies. See
Calvo and Végh (1992) and Savastano (1992) for early discussions of this problem.

7

See, for example, Calvo and Reinhart (2000a) and Hausmann, Panizza and Stein (2001).

The foreign currency need not be the U.S. dollar. Any economy where private sector assets
and/or private or public sector debts are denominated in a currency different from the
country’s own would be a dollarized economy according to this definition.

-8-

countries or territories that are fully—or officially—dollarized.8 Because we are interested in
studying partial dollarization in the developing world, we do not include industrial countries
in our sample.9
To make the above definition operational we employ two devices: (i) we construct a
composite index of dollarization for every country in the sample; and (ii) we classify the
countries into four categories according to the variety—or “type”—of dollarization they
exhibit.
We define the composite index as the (normalized) sum of bank deposits in foreign
currency as a share of broad money, total external debt as a share of GNP, and domestic
government debt denominated in (or linked to) a foreign currency as a share of total domestic
government debt. Each of the three components is previously transformed into an index that
can take a value from 0 to 10. Hence, in the end, the composite index allows us to measure
the degree of partial dollarization of every country in the sample on a scale that goes from 0
to 30 (see Appendix I).
We determine the variety of dollarization prevalent in each country at any point in
time on the basis of two separate criteria: the degree of domestic dollarization and the
amount of foreign borrowing by the private sector. We gauge domestic dollarization by

8

The definition covers those countries that belong to a monetary union which have foreign
(or domestic) debts denominated in a currency different from the currency of the union. Only
those countries that were fully dollarized before 1980 were altogether excluded from the
sample. See Edwards (2001) for a list of those countries.

Concretely, our country sample excludes all those defined as “Advanced Economies” in the
IMF’s World Economic Outlook, except for Hong Kong, Israel, Korea, Singapore and
Taiwan.

looking at the ratios of foreign currency deposits to broad money and of domestic
government debt in foreign currency to total government debt; countries are then divided in
two groups: those where both ratios are below 10 percent, and those where at least one of the
ratios exceeds 10 percent. To gauge the amount of private foreign borrowing we look at the
share of private sector debt in total external debt; here too, countries are divided in two
groups: those where private sector debt accounts for at least 10 percent of total external debt,
and those where the share is below 10 percent.
The two criteria put together allow us to classify the dollarized economies into four
categories or “types,” as shown in Table 1. Countries where domestic and external liability
dollarization co-exist are classified as Type I; countries where dollarization is predominantly
of a domestic nature (i.e., where foreign borrowing by the private sector is relatively small)
are classified as Type II; countries where dollarization is predominantly of an external nature
(i.e., where domestic dollarization is negligible) and private foreign borrowing is not small
are classified as Type III; and countries where domestic dollarization is low and where the
bulk of the external liabilities are owed by the government are classified as Type IV.

In our view, using the two-pronged approach just described to investigate the extent
and effects of partial dollarization in the developing world has a number of advantages
compared to the standard empirical study on partial dollarization.
First, it produces a measure of dollarization for every country that encompasses both
holdings of foreign currency assets by the private sector and the external foreign currency
liabilities of the economy.
Second, the inclusion of domestic government debt in foreign currency in the
composite index takes explicitly into account a form of domestic dollarization that has
become increasingly important in many countries and which has thus far been ignored by
studies on dollarization (Figure 2).10
And third, the approach relies on quantitative indicators easily applicable to all
countries to measure the degree and type of dollarization, hence reducing the scope for
introducing bias in empirical analyses of the data caused by arbitrary manipulations of the
sample.

10

This variety of dollarization is of relatively recent vintage. Argentina in the 1980s and
Mexico in the early 1990s were probably two of the first instances where governments of
developing countries that had a national currency borrowed locally in dollar-indexed
instruments to finance their fiscal deficits. Governments of many countries, in Latin America
and elsewhere, have adopted a similar financing strategy since then. In fact, figure 2 shows
that, as of end-2001, a total of 22 countries had more than US$ 230 billion of debt
outstanding in instruments of this type--see Reinhart et al. (2003) for a further discussion.

Of course, our methodology also has shortcomings. Three of these are worth
discussing briefly.
First, owing mainly to lack of data, the composite index understates the “true” degree
of dollarization in every economy. On the asset side, it does not account either for the cash
holdings of foreign currency or for the deposits households and firms maintain in banks
abroad (see Figure 1). The downward bias that these omissions impart to the measure of
dollarization may be significant for many countries.11 On the liability side, the composite
index does not include local borrowing in foreign currency by the private sector. The
omission of bank loans in foreign currency is in part deliberate, out of concerns that their

- 12 -

inclusion would introduce double-counting.12 The omission of other forms of local borrowing
in foreign currency (e.g., locally issued corporate bonds denominated in foreign currency),
however, is due exclusively to lack of data.
Second, the ratio of external debt to GNP and the share of private sector debt in total
external debt are admittedly coarse measures of external liability dollarization that do not
allow to gauge accurately the size and/or propagation of sectoral balance sheet effects.
And third, the composite index combines variables that are generally not determined
or explained by the same set of economic and/or institutional factors. For example, a past
history of macroeconomic instability and high inflation is likely to be one of the root causes
of a high degree of domestic dollarization, but would probably not be a good predictor of the
size of a country’s external debt.
Of the three shortcomings just mentioned, the last one is probably the least
worrisome. The reason is that, because it measures dollarization along two different
dimensions (degree and variety), our two-pronged methodology has the flexibility to test and
cross-check any given hypothesis using all or part of the sample. Illustrating the usefulness
of the methodology for ascertaining whether the regularities and trends in the data depend on
the degree and/or type of dollarization is, in fact, a key objective of the empirical analyses of
the following two sections.

12

This is because, for prudential reasons, the share of foreign currency deposits in total bank
deposits tends to be highly correlated with, and roughly the same size as, the share of foreign
currency loans in total loans--see de Nicoló et al. (2003), Figure 2, for recent evidence.

- 13 -

IV. THE WORLDWIDE SPREAD OF THE ADDICTION
The application of the dual classification approach described above reveals a number
of interesting trends in the evolution of dollarization in developing countries over the last two
decades.
One fact that stands out is the notable increase in the degree and incidence of
dollarization that has occurred in the developing world between the early 1980s and the late
1990s. Indeed, Figure 3 shows that the frequency distribution of the composite dollarization
index (computed using five-year averages for each country) has shifted markedly to the right
between 1980-85 and 1996-2001. What this shift indicates is that the degree of dollarization
in developing countries has risen during that period. The number of economies with a
composite index higher than 12, for example, was much larger in 1996-2001 than during
1980-85. The rising dollarization of bank deposits in many countries and the increased
reliance on dollar-linked domestic debt by governments account for the bulk of the recorded
increases in the composite index.

The higher incidence of dollarization—i.e., the increase in the number of partially
dollarized economies—is captured by Table 2. According to the table, in the early 1980s less
than 10 percent of the countries in our sample exceeded the low thresholds of domestic
dollarization utilized to classify an economy as Type I or Type II; in the late 1990s, however,
more than one-half of the sample exceeded one or both of those thresholds. The table also
shows that two thirds of the countries were classified as Type IV economies in the early
1980s, which implies that, not so long ago, external liability dollarization of government
debts was the predominant variety of dollarization in the developing world. By the late
1990s, however, the share of Type IV economies had fallen to almost one third.
The addition of new countries to the sample in the 1990s, especially the Transition
Economies, and the increased availability of data on the variables used to construct the
composite index, have indeed contributed to the changes in the aggregate indicators of
dollarization reported in Table 2. Nonetheless, it is still the case that by the late 1990s ninety
developing countries (almost two thirds of the sample) exhibited varieties of dollarization
primarily linked to decisions and activities of the private sector.

Another important fact unveiled by our dual classification approach is the large
regional variation that has characterized the spread, degree, and varieties of dollarization in
developing countries during the last two decades. Table 3 illustrates this feature of the
process of dollarization. The table shows that the average degree of dollarization in Africa
has been similar to that prevalent in the Western Hemisphere throughout the years. However,
the dollarization experienced by most African countries has been of the type IV variety. In
terms of domestic dollarization—i.e., foreign currency bank deposits and domestic
government debt in foreign currency—Africa has consistently been the least dollarized
region of the world, followed by Asia.
Table 3 also shows that domestic dollarization has been consistently high in the
Middle East since the early 1980s, and in the Transition Economies since the early 1990s.
Moreover, in the latter group the average composite index more than doubled, and reached
levels similar to the average for the Western Hemisphere, in less than a decade. Lastly, the
table shows that dollarization has spread at a fairly steady pace across the three sub-regions
of the Western Hemisphere since the 1980s, and that South America has consistently been
among the most dollarized regions of the world.

As we have said, distinguishing among four varieties of dollarization facilitates the
identification of key empirical regularities in dollarized economies. Hypotheses concerning
the link between monetary policy and dollarization, for example, would seem a priori more
applicable to countries that exhibit the first three varieties (types) of dollarization than to
those classified as Type IV economies. The reason is that, conceptually, the relationship
between government foreign borrowing—the primary form of dollarization in Type IV
economies—and monetary policy is generally tenuous and weak, especially in cases where
the public sector borrows mainly from official creditors. Empirical analyses of the links
between monetary policy and dollarization, therefore, should probably exclude Type IV
economies from the sample in order to obtain meaningful results.
Table 4 lists the ninety economies that comprise the sample of Type I to Type III

dollarization index. (The same economies grouped according to their variety of dollarization
are listed in Appendix II.) 13
The individual averages reported in the table reveal a fair amount of inter-regional
and intra-regional variation in the degree of dollarization. For example, less than 50 percent
of the countries with a composite index of 14 or higher (the group with “very high”
dollarization) are from the Western Hemisphere,14 whereas close to one third of the fifty

As noted earlier, the degree and variety of dollarization of each individual country was

Ecuador recorded the highest degree of dollarization during this period (25 out of a

V. DOLLARIZATION AND MONETARY POLICY--MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING?
A view widely held among economists and policymakers is that partial dollarization
makes monetary policy more complex and less effective. A recent IMF Occasional Paper
summarized this view when it stated: “The phenomenon of dollarization poses a challenge to
the pursuit of a coherent and independent monetary policy” (Baliño et al., 1999, page 14).
Similar assertions can be easily found in numerous surveys and studies on partial
dollarization.
The conventional view is primarily anchored on theoretical results from the early
literature on currency substitution, and on the fact that the first documented cases of partial
dollarization in the developing world occurred in high inflation countries, especially from
Latin America.15 However, a closer look at the currency substitution models and at the
empirical studies based on those models reveals a rather weak support for the view that
dollarization hinders the effectiveness of monetary policy.
The early theoretical models of currency substitution did produce important results
concerning the effects that the presence of foreign currency could have on the exchange rate
and monetary policy of an economy that issued its own national currency. Many of those
results have survived the passage of time and the adoption of new modeling techniques.16
Nonetheless, it has been clear at least since Thomas (1985) that currency substitution is not
15

Ortiz (1983) and Ramírez-Rojas (1985) were two of the first studies of the now vast
empirical literature on dollarization inspired on currency substitution models.
16

Examples of these are the results that established a strong direct association between the
degree of currency substitution and the volatility of a floating exchange rate, the instability of
domestic money velocity, and the inflation rate needed to close a fiscal gap with revenues
from seigniorage. See Calvo and Végh (1992, 1996) and Giovannini and Turtelboom (1994).

- 21 -

the same as asset dollarization, and that some of the results obtained from models of currency
substitution hinged critically on the assumption that the demand for foreign currency
represents primarily a demand for a second means of payment rather than for another
financial asset.
The vast empirical literature on dollarization in developing countries inspired by the
early models of currency substitution has focused primarily on ascertaining whether the
relative holdings of foreign money to domestic money (the “dollarization ratio”) in one or
many countries can be explained by relative rates of return of the two monies, and several
other variables. These studies generally have found that relative rates of return are indeed an
important determinant of a number of variants of the dollarization ratio. Oftentimes,
however, authors have used those results as a platform for making inferences about issues
related to monetary policy that normally were implicit in the model used to derive the
equations that were estimated in the studies, but that had not been tested directly--see
Savastano (1996).
The new theoretical literature on liability dollarization also has produced results
relevant for monetary policy. Of these, one that has attracted considerable attention is the
association between liability dollarization and “fear of floating.” That is, the conjecture that
the presence of liability dollarization—i.e., of private sector debts in foreign currency—will
tend to make countries less tolerant to large exchange rate changes, out of concern of the
adverse effects those changes may have on sectoral balance sheets and, ultimately, on
aggregate output.17 This key result has clear implications for monetary policy, in particular
17

See, for example, Calvo and Reinhart (2000b, 2002) and Céspedes et al. (2000).

- 22 -

for the relationship between interest rates and exchange rate shocks and for the scope for
countercyclical monetary policy. Nonetheless, these models do not find nor claim that
monetary policy is ineffective to control inflation, or particularly difficult to conduct in
practice.
As in the studies from the earlier strand, the main focus of the empirical work on
liability dollarization has not been to test the effectiveness of monetary policy per se, but
rather to detect and explain systematic differences in monetary policy responses across
countries. Also as in the earlier literature, the results obtained by these newer (and fewer)
studies are broadly supportive of their main hypotheses, as they tend to find systematic
differences in responses of monetary policy across countries that are generally consistent
with the hypothesis of fear of floating.18 However, these studies have been less prone to
make inferences about aspects of monetary policy that had not been tested directly. And
typically have not interpreted their finding of systematic differences across countries in the
responses of monetary policy as evidence of higher complexity or lower effectiveness of
monetary policy, especially for inflation control.
Surprisingly, growing evidence of the persistence of domestic dollarization in
countries where inflation was successfully abated does not seem to have weakened the
conventional view regarding the presumed ineffectiveness of monetary policy in dollarized
economies. Following the seminal study by Guidotti and Rodriguez (1992) several authors
have documented that large and sustained falls in inflation generally have not been not

18

See Calvo and Reinhart (2000b, 2002) and Hausmann, Panizza and Stein (2001).

- 23 -

followed by a decline in domestic dollarization.19 Moreover, a number of studies have
explored the reasons for this empirical regularity--e.g., Uribe (1997), Ize and Levy-Yeyati
(1998). The starting point for much of this literature has been the premise that high
dollarization can indeed co-exist with low inflation; that is, that dollarization does not
preclude monetary policy from attaining, and maintaining, its primary goal. It is not easy to
reconcile this prima facie evidence of the effectiveness of monetary policy in partially
dollarized economies with the notion that monetary policy is more challenging and/or less
effective in the presence of dollarization. Nonetheless, that notion has tended to prevail.
It seems to us that further empirical work focused on the distinctive features of
monetary policy in dollarized economies is needed to elicit a much needed revision of this
entrenched conventional view. The dual classification approach developed in this paper is,
we think, ideally suited for this task.
Another look at the effectiveness of monetary policy
In this sub-section and the next we present new evidence on the effectiveness and
channels of monetary policy in partially dollarized economies. Our goal is to shed further
light on the influences that dollarization exerts on monetary policy, taking advantage of our
proposed broad definition of a dollarized economy and of our criteria for classifying those
economies according to their degree and variety of dollarization.
The methodology we followed is fairly simple, and consists, for the most part, of
using summary indicators for different groups and samples of dollarized economies to
19

Examples include Mueller (1994), Savastano (1996), Mongardini and Mueller (2000), and
Havrylyshyn and Beddies (2003).

- 24 -

identify similarities and differences regarding key aspects of monetary policy. A strength of
the methodology is that it allows us to assess the evidence in support of any given hypothesis
or conjecture using data from many different sub-samples.20 An obvious shortcoming is that,
with one exception, we do not use formal econometric tests to properly control for the direct
and indirect influences that other variables typically exert on any given indicator of monetary
policy. Overall, we think that the gains we derive from the broad scope and multidimensional nature of our analysis outweigh the loss stemming from its lack of accuracy.
Especially since our main goal is to help place future discussions and research on
dollarization in the right context, rather than provide firm and definitive evidence on the
consequences of dollarization for monetary policy.
The logical place to start any assessment of monetary policy is to examine the
policy’s track record in delivering the main goals it is supposed to attain. There is little
dispute that the overriding goal of monetary policy is to attain and maintain a low and stable
rate of inflation, and that another important goal is to reduce the volatility of aggregate
output--e.g., Fischer (1994). Most theoretical and empirical models of monetary policy of
the last two decades have summarized this wide consensus by expressing the objective
function of the monetary authority in terms of two main goals: the rate of inflation and a
measure of output fluctuations—both expressed relative to some target or trend--e.g., Barro
20

Specifically, the methodology allows us to use 10 to 14 observations to assess any given
hypothesis or empirical regularity. These observations are the result of organizing the sample
of dollarized economies in categories according to the level of the composite dollarization
index (2 to 4 categories) and according to the variety or type of dollarization (3 categories),
and from computing summary indicators for two different samples—the long (but smaller)
sample with annual observations for the period 1980-2001, and the short (but larger) sample
with annual observations for 1996-2001. See Appendix I.

- 25 -

and Gordon (1983), Rogoff (1985).
It is well known that the track record of developing countries as a whole in complying
with those two main objectives of monetary policy is fairly unimpressive, especially until the
mid-1990s. Overall, the evidence for the sample of dollarized economies used in this study
corroborates this well known fact. The evidence, however, also unveils a number of
important patterns associated with particular degrees and/or varieties of dollarization.
With regard to the primary goal of monetary policy, the evidence in Tables 5 and 6
shows that the average inflation rate is consistently higher and more variable in countries
with a high degree of dollarization than in countries where the degree of dollarization is low
or moderate, in both the long and the short samples. The evidence also shows that, excluding
Brazil, average inflation is the lowest in countries where dollarization is predominantly of the
external variety (Type III economies). A third regularity captured in these tables is that
average inflation tends to be much lower and less volatile in the years 1996-2001 than in the
sample covering the earlier period, reflecting the generalized fall in inflation in the
developing world since the mid-1990s.
Clear patterns for output volatility and output growth are more difficult to detect. The
one consistent regularity is that output growth is highly volatile in economies with external
liability dollarization (Type III economies). The relation between output behavior and the
degree of dollarization, however, is different in the two samples. In the long sample, average
output growth is lower and less variable in countries with a high degree of dollarization.

However, in the short sample output growth is markedly more volatile in economies where
dollarization is high, while the average growth performance is broadly similar in countries
with high and low degrees of dollarization.
The ability to raise revenues from seigniorage is another benchmark commonly used
in the literature to assess the effectiveness of monetary policy, or the value of monetary
autonomy, in developing countries.21 The theoretical foundations of this common practice
are not nearly as solid as those that justify treating the inflation rate and output stability as the
main goals of monetary policy. 22 Consider, for example, the optimal inflation tax models.
Those models implicitly assume that the central bank is little more than a tax collection
agency for the government. Such assumption may be reasonable in countries or situations of
extreme fiscal dominance (e.g., during periods of very high inflation) but not in general, as it
precludes making any meaningful distinction between monetary policy and fiscal policy.
It turns out that the revenues from seigniorage do not differ much across the various
categories of dollarized economies, especially in the late 1990s. In fact, Table 7 shows that
from 1996 to 2001 the average revenue from money creation across the various groups of
dollarized economies ranged from 1½ to 2 percent of GDP and that the variability of those
revenues across groups was also fairly similar. There are, however, a couple of differences
among the groups that are worth noting. First, reflecting their different inflation performance,

21
22

For example, see Cukierman (1992), Fry, et al. (1996) and Berg and Borensztein (2000).

Masson et al. (1997) argue that the prominent role that seigniorage continues to have on
discussions of monetary policy in developing countries has hindered the emergence of widely
agreed models and tools to assess the performance of monetary policy as an independent
policy tool in those economies.

- 28 -

revenues from seigniorage are systematically higher in countries with a high degree of
dollarization than in countries with low or moderate dollarization. And second, average
seigniorage revenues are higher in countries where dollarization is predominantly of the
domestic variety (Type II economies) than in countries with the other two types of
dollarization.

Successful disinflations provide another yardstick against which to assess the relation
between dollarization and the effectiveness of monetary policy. Our sample of dollarized
economies includes 17 countries that were able to reduce inflation from a peak of 40 percent

- 29 -

per year or more to single digits during the period 1980-2001.23 Three salient features stand
out from the examination of these episodes.
First, the degree of dollarization had no discernible effects on the duration of the
disinflation. Specifically, the time it took these 17 countries to bring inflation down to single
digits does not seem to have been influenced by whether dollarization was high or low at the
time of the inflation peak (Figure 4, top chart). Except for Israel, which took almost 13 years
to bring annual inflation below 10 percent, countries that had a high degree of dollarization
when inflation was high did not take a much longer time to disinflate than countries with a
lower degree of dollarization.
Second, the degree of dollarization at the time of the inflation peak does not appear to
have influenced the growth performance during the disinflation. In fact, average output
growth during the disinflation period in those countries where dollarization was relatively
low at the time of the inflation peak is not vastly different from the average growth
performance during the disinflation in countries that had a high degree of dollarization
(Figure 4, bottom chart).
And third, successful disinflations generally have not been accompanied by large
declines in the degree of dollarization. In fact, the top panel of Figure 5 shows that the degree
of dollarization at the end of the disinflation was the same or higher than at the time of the
inflation peak in more than half of the episodes. Moreover, the fall in the degree of
dollarization in many of the other episodes was generally small. This persistence of the

dollarization process is consistent with the evidence on “hysteresis” found by the studies
mentioned earlier—which were based on a narrower measure of domestic dollarization.
The persistence of dollarization is a regularity that is also present in the larger sample
of dollarized economies, and tends to be associated with the countries’ inflation history. In
fact, countries that had repeated bouts of high inflation over the last few decades generally
exhibited a higher degree of dollarization in the late 1990s than countries with a better
inflationary history (Figure 5, lower panel). Interpreting the (unconditional) probability of
high inflation used in Figure 5 as a rough measure of monetary policy credibility gives some
insights as to why achieving low inflation is generally not a sufficient condition for a rapid
fall in the degree of dollarization; namely, a country with a poor inflationary history will
need to maintain inflation at low levels for a long period before it can significantly reduce the
probability of another inflation bout.24
The lower panel of Figure 5 also sheds light on the relationship between current
levels of dollarization and the countries’ exchange rate history. Parallel market exchange
rates and pervasive exchange controls have been the norm rather than the exception in
countries with a history of high inflation. Conversely, very few countries with hard pegs and
unified exchange rates have experienced bouts of high inflation.25 The evidence thus suggests

24

The following section examines in detail the experience of countries that have recorded
large declines in their degree of domestic dollarization, including in the context of
disinflations.
25

Recent estimates by Reinhart and Rogoff (2002) show that more than 60 percent of all
episodes where inflation exceeded 40 percent since the 1950s took place in countries that had
dual and/or parallel exchange rates, and that less than 5 percent of countries with hard pegs
and no parallel market for foreign exchange have had bouts of high inflation.

controls and multiple currency practices.

A look at the channels of monetary policy
Interest rates, monetary aggregates and the exchange rate are widely regarded as the
three main channels through which monetary policy affects the economy. Even for industrial
countries, however, there is considerably less consensus about the relative importance and
role of those three channels in the monetary transmission process than there is about the main
goals of monetary policy (Mishkin (1995)). For developing countries, where research on the
monetary transmission process is much thinner, consensus is far more elusive. In fact, the
wide disparities in financial deepening, fiscal dominance and integration to capital markets,
and the uneven pace at which reform in those areas has proceeded in different countries and
regions have held back progress in identifying the distinctive features of the monetary
transmission mechanism in developing economies.26
There is particularly little analysis on the interest rate channel. Heavy reliance on
interest rate controls, capital controls and monetary financing of fiscal deficits until the late
1980s (and, in some cases, until much later) rendered the interest rate channel of monetary
transmission largely inoperative for many countries. Empirical research on this channel,
including the one sparked by the recent literature on liability dollarization, has therefore been
largely limited to the experience of the most advanced developing economies in the 1990s.
The problems surrounding empirical assessments of the other two channels are
somewhat less severe. Money aggregates have gradually lost prominence in the monetary
policy frameworks of many advanced developing economies that have attained low inflation,
but in most non-industrial countries remain a core channel of transmission and continue to be
26

See Fry et al. (1996), Masson et al. (1997) and Kamin et al. (1998).

- 34 -

used in the formulation of monetary policy. Furthermore, it is not too difficult to obtain
reliable data on these aggregates for the majority of countries. Empirical analyses of the
exchange rate channel, on the other hand, are constrained by some of the factors that hinder
assessments of the interest rate channel, such as the high inflation and capital controls
prevalent in many developing economies until the late 1980s. Nonetheless, those obstacles
have become much less serious in recent years, and problems of data availability are not
nearly as limiting as those affecting interest rate series.27
Reflecting this state of affairs, our analyses of the effects of dollarization on the
monetary transmission process in dollarized economies focused primarily on the money
aggregate channel. This allowed us to empirically assess whether the changes in this channel
that were central to many theoretical predictions of the early literature on dollarization—
namely, that dollarization affects the level and variability of money velocity, as well as the
link between money and national income—were borne out by the data. In addition, we used
data for the late 1990s to obtain estimates of the exchange rate “pass-through” and to
examine the links between dollarization and exchange rate regimes, two aspects of the
exchange rate channel important for both strands of the literature on partial dollarization.
Overall, the evidence on money velocity is fairly inconclusive. For a start,
dollarization does not seem to have had much influence on the volatility of base money
velocity. The standard deviation of the growth rate of base money velocity is broadly
similar, and quite high, in groups comprising countries with different degrees of dollarization
27

The information content of official exchange rate series is a different matter, however; see
Reinhart and Rogoff (2002).

and different varieties of dollarization, in both the long and the short samples (Table 8). The
pattern is largely the same for velocity measures constructed with M1 (see Appendix III).
The volatility of broad money velocity, however, does differ across groups. In particular, the
velocity of broad money seems to be somewhat less volatile in economies with a low-tomoderate degree of dollarization, as well as in countries where dollarization is predominantly
of the external variety (Type III economies). Taken together, these patterns suggest that
dollarization tends to increase the instability of broad money velocity (and, hence, of broad
money demand), but does not seem to increase the instability of velocity measures of narrow
monetary aggregates—i.e., of the aggregates often used in the formulation of monetary
policy in developing countries.

The growth rates of money velocity for different monetary aggregates also exhibit
dissimilar patterns. The average velocity of broad money shows a steady decline in all
dollarized economies, in both the long and the short samples. The decline is most pronounced
in countries with a high degree of dollarization, and in those where both domestic and
external liability dollarization co-exist (Type I economies). In contrast, the average velocity
of base money shows an increase in the long sample, and a smaller decline than that of broad
money in the short sample. Two inferences can be made from this dissimilar behavior of
money velocity: first, the fall in the demand for domestic currency fueled by the high
inflation of the 1980s seems to have largely abated by the late 1990s; and second, the joint
existence of domestic and liability dollarization appears to have a positive effect on the
financial deepening of dollarized economies.
Clear differences in the effects of dollarization on the monetary channel across
dollarized economies are also difficult to detect on a wide range of money-growth
correlations.
Monetary aggregates are strongly correlated with the rate of inflation in all dollarized
economies (Tables 9-10). With a few exceptions—e.g., base money in economies with a low
degree of dollarization, and a couple of other cases (see Appendix III)—the correlations
between money and prices are uniformly high and statistically significant across all groups of
dollarized economies, in the two samples. This evidence, while admittedly rough and
tentative, is broadly consistent with the observed patterns on money velocity, and does not
give much support to the view that reining in monetary growth is not an effective antiinflationary policy in dollarized economies.

The correlation between monetary aggregates and real variables in dollarized
economies, on the other hand, is either weak or non-existent. There is some evidence of a
positive and significant correlation between monetary aggregates and output growth in
economies with a low degree of dollarization and in those where dollarization is
predominantly external in the short sample (Table 10; Appendix III, Table 18). In all other
cases, however, and particularly in the long sample, the correlations between money and
aggregate output, and between money and real private consumption are not statistically
significant, and are oftentimes negative. Based on these results, we would conjecture that
factors different from dollarization are those that explain the low correlation between money
and real variables, and hence the limited scope for countercyclical monetary policy, in
developing countries.
We were able to find more conclusive evidence of systematic differences among the
various categories of dollarized when we analyzed the pass-through from exchange rate to
prices. Table 11 shows the results from panel regressions covering the period 1996-2001.
The results suggest that the inflationary impact of exchange rate changes was indeed
different across dollarized economies. Specifically, the pass-through from exchange rate to
prices was the largest in economies where the degree of dollarization was very high and in
those where there was little private liability dollarization (Type II economies), and was the
lowest in economies where the degree of dollarization was low and in those where there was
little domestic dollarization (Type III economies).

- 39 -

The regression results also suggest that in the large majority of dollarized
economies—i.e., in the 66 countries where the degree of dollarization was either high or
moderate during 1996-2001—the pass-through coefficient is about 0.5, which is comparable
to estimates found in other cross-country studies for developing countries.28 These results
are broadly supportive of one central premise of the hypothesis of “fear of floating,” namely,
that a high pass-through coefficient is one of the reasons why central banks have little
tolerance for large exchange rate changes.

The exchange rate regimes prevalent in our sample of dollarized economies during
the period 1996-2001 also suggest a link between “fear of floating” and the degree of
dollarization. As Table 12 shows, all groups of dollarized economies exhibited, de facto,
remarkably similar degrees of exchange rate flexibility that corresponded broadly to regimes
where the exchange rate fluctuated within relatively narrow bands.29 In line with the results
from the pass-through regressions, however, countries with a very high degree of
dollarization exhibited a significantly lower degree of exchange rate flexibility—i.e., more
acute “fear of floating”—than the other dollarized economies.

VI. COMBATING THE ADDICTION
The evidence reported in the previous section suggests that partial dollarization does
not have first-order adverse effects on monetary policy, especially for the purpose of inflation
control. This is not the same as saying that partial dollarization carries no costs. Partial
dollarization indeed can create large currency mismatches in developing countries. Those
mismatches tend to remain hidden during tranquil times but can wreak havoc in all sectors of
the economy, and particularly in the banking system, pretty quickly after a large depreciation
(Goldstein and Turner 2003). The dynamics of bank runs, and the scope for arresting them,
including through the provision of central bank liquidity, also are quite different, and more
complex, in economies with a high degree of domestic dollarization--e.g., de Nicoló et al.
(2003); Gulde et al. (2003).
The financial fragility of dollarized economies was brought to the fore in the late
1990s by the Asian crises and, more recently, by the banking crises in Argentina and
Uruguay. The evidence from these crises makes it clear that an attitude of “benign neglect”
towards partial dollarization in general, and towards domestic dollarization in particular,
carries considerable risks. In fact, we would tend to agree that containing partial
dollarization, and particularly domestic dollarization, is a worthy goal of economic policy in
developing countries.
That being said, we are highly skeptical of recent proposals that outline the “road
towards successful de-dollarization” without bothering to see what the evidence has to say
about the origins of the addiction and about past attempts at combating it --e.g., Hausmann
(2001), Levy-Yeyati (2003). We do not think that any “de-dollarization blueprint” that
ignores history can be taken seriously. In our view, the merits of any such strategy ought to

- 42 -

be assessed against, and contrasted with, the historical track record of countries that have
largely avoided domestic dollarization, and of those which have managed to reduce
significantly their degree of domestic dollarization. We provide a brief overview of those
records in the rest of this section.
Avoiding Domestic Dollarization
Almost one-half of the developing economies in our sample did not exhibit a
significant degree of domestic dollarization by the late 1990s (Table 2, bottom panel). These
are the 71 economies classified as Type III and Type IV; that is, the countries where foreign
currency deposits accounted for less than 10 percent of broad money and where less than 10
percent of the government’s domestic debt was denominated in foreign currency—or linked
to the exchange rate (Appendix II).
Countries where bank deposits in foreign currency represented less than 10 percent of
broad money exhibit wide differences among them, and can be usefully divided in three
broad groups.
A first group is formed by countries that have not experienced periods of high
inflation or severe macroeconomic instability and have managed to retain the bulk of private
savings in their domestic financial system. India, many economies of South East Asia, and
some from Northern Africa belong to this group.
A second group is formed by countries where large macroeconomic imbalances led to
periods of high or very high inflation and where the authorities tried to avert the erosion of
financial savings caused by inflation by promoting financial indexation schemes not linked to
a foreign currency, and by imposing various types of capital controls. Brazil, Chile,
Colombia, and Israel, to some extent (see below), belong in this group.

- 43 -

And the third group is comprised by countries where the authorities relied mainly on
financial repression and capital controls to try to arrest the erosion of financial savings fueled
by recurrent bouts of macroeconomic instability. Waves of capital flight and secular financial
disintermediation are central features of the countries in this group—e.g., Venezuela,
Nigeria, and many other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.30
As for avoiding the other form of domestic dollarization (locally issued public debt
denominated in foreign currency), countries either have opted to refrain from issuing that
type of instrument—the case of most Type III economies—or have been unable to do so due
to the absence of a domestic bond market.
The above discussion illustrates clearly the endogenous character of domestic
dollarization. Macroeconomic instability leads to financial adaptation. Countries with
unstable macroeconomic environments facilitate such adaptation when they allow residents
to hold financial assets indexed to a foreign currency or to some other stable unit of account,
and stifle the adaptation when they impose additional distortions that lead to financial
disintermediation and capital flight. These are the options governments have at their disposal
to try to minimize the adverse effects of macroeconomic instability. They are all second-best,
and they all entail costs. Theory and evidence suggest that the latter option is probably the
most costly of the three. Ranking the other two, however, is more difficult.

30

Claessens (1997) and Ajayi and Khan (2000) provide recent estimates of capital flight
from some of these countries.

- 44 -

In fact, domestic dollarization may not be the optimal form of indexation for most
developing economies.31 But it is also the case that in many of those economies financial
markets are not large enough or deep enough to support a highly liquid market for indexed
instruments. Simplicity, credibility and transparency also tend to tilt the scale in favor of
dollarization compared to alternative indexation schemes. Overall, and notwithstanding its
potential costs, it is an open question whether a rigorous comparison of the net gains of these
two modalities of financial adaptation would show that avoiding domestic dollarization is the
most suitable strategy (or the “natural” endogenous outcome) for all developing economies
with a history of macroeconomic instability.
Undoing Domestic Dollarization
We have shown in Section V that reducing inflation is generally not sufficient to undo
domestic dollarization, at least in five year-plus horizons. Nevertheless, some countries have
managed to reduce their degree of domestic dollarization. To identify those countries it is
again useful to treat separately cases where the reduction in domestic dollarization originated
in a decline in locally issued foreign currency public debt from those that originated in a
decline in the share of foreign currency deposits in broad money.
The few governments in our sample that managed to de-dollarize their locally issued
foreign currency obligations followed one of two strategies: they either amortized the
outstanding debt stock at the original terms and discontinued the issuance of those securities,
or they changed the currency denomination of the debt—sometimes, but not always, using
31

For analyses of the theory and practice of (non-dollar) indexation see Dornbusch and
Simonsen (1983) and Lefort and Schmidt-Hebbel (2002).

- 45 -

market-based approaches. Mexico’s decision to redeem in U.S. dollars all the dollar-linked
Tesobonos outstanding at the time of the December 1994 crisis (using the loans it received
from the IMF and the US) and to cease issuing domestic foreign-currency denominated
bonds thereafter, is one example of the former strategy. Argentina’s decision in late 2001 to
convert to domestic currency the government bonds that it had originally issued in U.S.
dollars (under Argentine law) is a recent example of the second.
Falls in domestic dollarization caused by declines in the share of foreign currency
deposits to broad money are more common in our sample. To identify only those cases where
the reversal of deposit dollarization was large and lasting, we searched for all those episodes
where the ratio of foreign currency deposits to broad money satisfied the following three
conditions: (a) experienced a decline of at least 20 percentage points; (b) settled at a level
below 20 percent immediately following the decline; and (c) remained below 20 percent until
the end of the sample period .
Only four of the eighty-five countries with data on foreign currency deposits met the
three criteria during the period 1980-2001: Israel, Mexico, Pakistan and Poland (Figure 6). In
sixteen other countries the ratio of foreign currency deposits to broad money declined by
more than 20 percentage points during some interval of the 1980-2001 period. However, in
some of these countries—e.g., Bulgaria and Lebanon—the deposit dollarization ratio settled
at a level considerably higher than 20 percent following the decline. And in the majority of

- 46 -

the other cases (12 out of the 16) the dollarization ratio fell below the 20 percent mark
initially, but rebounded later to levels in excess of 20 percent.32

In three of the four cases that complied with the three conditions for a large and
lasting decline of the deposit dollarization ratio, the reversal started the moment the
authorities imposed restrictions on the convertibility of dollar deposits. In Israel, in late 1985,
the authorities introduced a one-year mandatory holding period for all deposits in foreign
currency, making those deposits substantially less attractive than other indexed financial
32

This pattern was particularly common among the Transition Economies in the second half
of the 1990s (e.g., Azerbaijan, Belarus, Lithuania and Russia), but was also present in other
countries and periods—e.g., Bolivia and Peru in the early 1980s, and Egypt in the mid-1990s.

- 47 -

instruments—see Bufman and Leiderman (1992). In Mexico and Pakistan, by contrast, the
authorities forcedly converted the dollar deposits into deposits in domestic currency, in 1982
and 1998, respectively, using for the conversion an exchange rate that was substantially
below (i.e., more appreciated) than the prevailing market rate.
Interestingly, not all the countries that introduced severe restrictions on the
availability of dollar deposits managed to lower the deposit dollarization ratio on a sustained
basis. Bolivia and Peru adopted measures similar to those of Mexico and Pakistan in the early
1980s but, after some years of extreme macroeconomic instability that took them to the brink
of hyperinflation, both countries eventually reallowed foreign currency deposits, and have
since remained highly dollarized despite their remarkable success in reducing inflation—see
Figure 7.
Even in the countries where the restrictions on dollar deposits have, thus far, led to a
lasting decline of deposit dollarization the costs from de-dollarization were far from trivial.
In Mexico, capital flight nearly doubled (to about US$ 6.5 billion per year) and bank credit to
the private sector fell by almost one-half in the two years that followed the forced conversion
of dollar deposits, and the inflation and growth performance remained dismal for several
years (see Dornbusch and Werner, 1994). In Pakistan, it is too recent to tell whether the
compulsory de-dollarization of 1998 will be permanent or whether it will be eventually
reversed, as was the case in Bolivia and Peru.

In the end, Israel and Poland appear as the only two cases on record of large and
lasting reversals of deposit dollarization that had minimal side effects on financial
intermediation and/or capital flight. In both cases the de-dollarization started almost at the
same time as the authorities embarked on a (eventually successful) disinflation program
centered around a strong exchange rate anchor, and the domestic financial system offered
assets with alternative forms of indexation (Israel) or very high real interest rates (Poland)--

- 49 -

see Bufman and Leiderman (1995) and Chopra (1994).
Whether the circumstances and conditions present in Israel and Poland can or should
be replicated by other economies with a relatively high degree of domestic dollarization, is
not all that clear, especially since it is not apparent that other types of indexation are always
preferable to dollarization. In our view, those interested in drawing blueprints for dedollarization need to tackle head on these difficult questions.
VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we propose a broader and more up-to-date definition of partial
dollarization that encompasses private sector holdings of foreign currency assets and private
and public external foreign currency liabilities. With this new measure we identify recent
trends in the evolution of dollarization in the developing world, take a fresh look at the
conventional view regarding the supposed ineffectiveness of monetary policy in dollarized
economies, and review the evidence on successful de-dollarization.
We show that there has been a large increase in the degree and incidence of
dollarization in developing countries in the last two decades. By the late 1990s,
72 developing economies exhibited non-negligible degrees of domestic dollarization, and
another 18 had relatively high exposure to private external liability dollarization. We argue
that a history of high inflation, increased reliance of governments on locally-issued dollarlinked debt, increased access to global capital markets, and the appearance in scene of the
Transition Economies are the key factors behind the recorded rise in worldwide dollarization.
We also show that the spread of dollarization has not been uniform across or within regions;
dollarization has been consistently high in the Middle East, in the Transition Economies

- 50 -

since the 1990s and, especially, in South America, while it has been consistently low in
Africa and in most of Asia.
Overall, we find little empirical support for the view that dollarization hinders the
effectiveness of monetary policy. We show that average inflation has indeed been higher and
more volatile in countries with a high degree of dollarization than in those where the degree
of dollarization has been low or moderate.
However, we find no evidence that would suggest that dollarization makes it more
difficult to bring down inflation from high levels, or that it alters or adds complexity to the
monetary transmission process—particularly through systematic changes in the behavior of
money velocity, or in the link between money and prices. Seigniorage revenues, a monetary
policy aspect stressed by the early literature on dollarization, are found to be fairly similar—
both in terms of levels and variability—across all categories of dollarized economies,
especially in the late 1990s. Output fluctuations, and the scope for using countercyclical
monetary policy to reduce them, are also found to be fairly similar in countries with different
degrees and varieties of dollarization.
One area of monetary policy where we find systematic differences among the various
categories of dollarized economies, at least in the recent period, is in the pass-through from
exchange rate to prices. Concretely, our evidence suggests that during the late 1990s the
inflationary impact of exchange rate changes was the largest in economies where the degree
of dollarization was very high and in those where there was little private liability
dollarization, and the lowest in countries where the overall degree of dollarization was low
and domestic dollarization was negligible. We see these results as broadly supportive of
recent theories of “fear of floating” that identify a high pass-through coefficient as one key

- 51 -

reason why central banks in emerging economies exhibit little tolerance to large exchange
rate changes.
We then review developing countries’ record in combating their addiction to dollars.
Specifically, we provide a taxonomy of countries that have avoided domestic dollarization,
and review the historical record of episodes of de-dollarization in the developing world over
the last 25 years. We find that this record is not particularly encouraging. We are able to
identify only two countries, out of a total of 85, that managed to achieve large and lasting
declines in domestic dollarization without having to incur heavy costs in terms of financial
intermediation or capital flight--Israel and Poland. If we include countries that paid those
costs, we can probably add Mexico to the list. We argue that these few experiences provide
the background that is most relevant for a discussion of de-dollarization strategies, including
in particular the circumstances and conditions that may contribute to the success of those
strategies, and the horizon over which it may be reasonable to expect concrete results from
their adoption.

APPENDIX I

Sample, Methodology and Data Sources
Country Sample
The sample of countries used in the study comprised, in principle, all non-industrial
economies that issued a national currency during all or part of the period 1980-2001. Hong
Kong, Israel, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan were the only members of the group defined as
“Advanced Economies” in the IMF’s World Economic Outlook that were included in the
sample. Countries for which it was not possible to obtain data on either foreign currency
deposits in local banks or external debt for at least three consecutive years during the period
1980-2001 were excluded from the sample.
Composite Dollarization Index
The composite index of dollarization for each country was defined as the sum of the
ratio of foreign currency deposits to broad money, the ratio of domestic government debt in
foreign currency to total government debt, and the ratio of external debt to GNP. To
construct the composite, each of the three variables were previously transformed into an
index that took values ranging from 0 to 10. The criteria used to transform the ratios obtained
from the raw data into indices are summarized in Table 13 below.

The composite index for each country was calculated for all years between 1980 and
2001 for which actual data existed for at least one of the three ratios. The average degree of
dollarization for different sub-periods and/or regions reported in the tables and figures of
Section IV is the average of the annual values of the composite index for each country in the
corresponding group—in most cases the group average was rounded to the nearest integer.

The ranges for the composite index that were used to group the countries according to
their degree of dollarization in Table 4 of the main text and in all the tables of Section V
were the following:

Varieties of Dollarization
The degree of domestic dollarization and of private sector access to foreign
borrowing were the variables utilized to assign all countries in the sample to one of the four
varieties (types) of dollarization summarized in Table 1 of the main text.
As noted in the text , domestic dollarization was gauged by looking at the ratios of
foreign currency deposits to broad money and of domestic government debt in foreign
currency to total domestic government debt. Countries where none of the two ratios exceeded
10 percent during a particular period were regarded as having a negligible degree of domestic
dollarization and were assigned to the bottom row of Table 1—i.e., were pre-classified as
Type III or Type IV economies. Countries where at least one of the ratios exceeded 10
percent were assigned to the top row of Table 1, and, hence, were pre-classified as Type I or
Type II economies.
Private sector access to foreign borrowing was gauged by looking at the share of
private sector debt in total external debt—a variable not utilized to construct the composite
index. Countries where the share was below 10 percent were regarded as having limited
access to international capital markets and were assigned to the right-side column of Table
1—i.e., were pre-classified as Type II or Type IV economies. Countries where the share was
10 percent or higher were assigned to the left-side column of Table 1, and, thus, were
preclassified as Type I or Type III economies.
The variety of dollarization prevalent in each country was assessed at three different
intervals of the 1980-2001 period: 1980-1985, 1988-1993, and 1996-2001 (see Tables 2 and
3 of the main text). In each sub-period, the thresholds for gauging the degree of domestic
dollarization and of private sector access to foreign borrowing were calculated by taking the
average of the annual ratios for the corresponding years. Since the external debt series for the
majority of countries ended in the year 2000, however, the private sector access to foreign
borrowing for the sub-period 1996-2001 was assessed on the basis of the average from 1996
to 2000.

APPENDIX I

Period Coverage
The length of the composite index series in each country was determined primarily:
(i) by the length of the series on foreign currency deposits (in economies classified as Type I
or Type II); and/or (ii) by the length of the series on external debt (in economies classified as
Type III or Type IV).
There was a high variance in the length of the composite index series across the
countries of the sample. One reason for this was the appearance in scene of the Transition
economies in the early 1990s; another one was the sheer lack of long time series on the
currency composition of bank deposits. To deal with this problem, all empirical analyses of
the effects of dollarization on monetary policy in Section V, except the one on disinflation
episodes (see below), was undertaken using two different-sized samples:
(i) a long sample, comprising about 48 countries for which there were annual
observations for the composite dollarization index and the other relevant variables for
all (or most of) the period 1980-2001;33 and
(ii) a short sample, comprising the 90 countries for which there were annual data for
all the variables for the period 1996-2001.
The countries that formed part of the two samples are listed below.
Long sample: Angola, Bahrain, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, Colombia, Costa
Rica, Cote d’Ivoire, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Fiji, Guatemala,
Honduras, Hong Kong , Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Kenya, Korea, Kuwait, Lebanon,
Malaysia, Mauritius, Mexico, Netherlands Antilles, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru,
Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Poland, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, St. Kitts and
Nevis, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Uganda, Uruguay and Venezuela.
Short sample: Albania, Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, Bolivia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Chile, China, Colombia, Congo DR, Costa
Rica, Cote d’Ivoire, Croatia, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Estonia, Fiji,
Georgia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary,
Indonesia, Israel, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao, Latvia,

Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Sao Tomé and
Principe, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Solomon

The size and composition of the sample varied slightly depending on whether the analysis
focused on the types of dollarization (41 countries) or the degree of dollarization (45
countries).

Disinflation Episodes
Table 15 below summarizes key features of the seventeen disinflation episodes
discussed in Section V (Figures 4 and 5). Specifically, the table shows the years and the
inflation rates corresponding to the beginning and end of each disinflation episode—defined
as the year when the annual inflation rate reached its in-sample peak, and the first year when
it fell below 10 percent.

Data Sources
Foreign Currency Deposits: data on foreign currency deposits were obtained from a number
of sources. These included (number of countries in parenthesis): the IMF’s Money and
Banking electronic database, MBTS, (44 countries), the IMF’s International Financial
Statistics, IFS, (13 countries); data provided by IMF country desks (26 countries), IMF staff
documents (6 countries) and national sources—e.g., central bank websites or annual
reports—(9 countries).
Broad Money: the IMF’s MBTS and IFS were the primary sources for the series on broad
money for about 70 countries. In those cases where the series on foreign currency deposits
was obtained from a source different from the MBTS and IFS, care was taken to ensure that
the broad money series used to compute the “dollarization ratio” (i.e., the ratio of foreign

- 56 -

APPENDIX I

currency deposits to broad money) included foreign currency deposits. For the other 24
countries, broad money series were provided by IMF country desks (12 countries) or
obtained from IMF staff documents (6 countries) and from national sources (6 countries).
External Debt: for most countries in the sample the series on external debt (total and private)
were taken directly from the World Bank’s Global Development Finance (GDF) database—
which, as of December 2002, only contained data up to the year 2000. For those countries in
the sample not included in the GDF (e.g., Hong Kong , Israel, Saudi Arabia, Singapore)
external debt series were obtained from the Joint OECD-BIS-IMF-World Bank Statistics on
External Debt website and/or from IMF staff documents.
Domestic public debt denominated in foreign currency information on this variable was
solicited to, and provided by, IMF desks economist and corroborated with national sources.
Altogether, we were able to collect data series on this variable for about 23 countries for the
period 1996-2001 (see Figure 2).
The series on Gross Domestic Product (nominal and real) and Real Private Consumption
were obtained from the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO) database. In all countries
where the data on external debt originated in the World Bank’s GDF, the Gross National
Product (in U.S. dollars) was used as the denominator of the external debt-to-output ratio. In
the other cases the ratio was constructed using the WEO series of Gross Domestic Product in
U.S. dollars.
For most countries, the (annual) series on consumer price indices and reserve money (used to
construct the series on inflation and seigniorage) were taken directly from the IFS. In the
cases of Guinea, Lebanon, São Tomé and Principe, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, United Arab
Emirates, and Uzbekistan the consumer price indices series were taken from the WEO. Data
on exchange rates (end of period) were also obtained from the WEO and the IFS.
Seigniorage was defined as the annual change in the monetary base divided by nominal GDP
in all countries except Argentina, Chile, Israel and Uruguay. In these four countries, the IFS
series of reserve money include indexed and/or remunerated deposits. To control for this,
seigniorage was defined as the annual change in M1 divided by nominal GDP in the cases of
Argentina, Chile and Uruguay; and as the change in the monetary base excluding foreign
currency deposits divided by nominal GDP in the case of Israel.
