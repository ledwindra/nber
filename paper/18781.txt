Commercial Building Electricity Consumption Dynamics: The Role of Structure Quality,
Human Capital, and Contract Incentives
Matthew E. Kahn, Nils Kok, and John M. Quigley
NBER Working Paper No. 18781
February 2013
JEL No. H23,H41,Q54,Q55
ABSTRACT
Commercial real estate plays a key role in determining the urban sustainability of a metropolitan area.
While the residential sector has been the primary focus of energy policies, commercial buildings are
now responsible for most of the durable building stock’s total electricity consumption. This paper
exploits a unique panel of commercial buildings to investigate the impact of building vintage, contract
incentives, and human capital on electricity consumption across commercial structures. We document
that electricity consumption and building quality are complements, not substitutes. Technological progress
may reduce the energy demand from heating, cooling and ventilation, but the behavioral response
of building tenants and the large-scale adoption of appliances more than offset these savings, leading
to increases in energy consumption in more recently constructed, more efficient structures.

Introduction
Economic research investigating urban greenhouse gas production has mainly

focused on the transportation sector’s consumption of gasoline and the residential
sector’s energy consumption and the power generation sector’s energy consumption
(Edward L. Glaeser and Matthew E. Kahn, 2010, Koichiro Ito, 2012, Matthew J. Kotchen
and Erin T. Mansur, 2012). But in the service economy, most work activity takes place in
commercial buildings and a significant amount of shopping activity occurs in the
commercial sector’s structures. The commercial sector is thus a major user of natural
resources, consuming about 19 percent of total U.S. energy use in 2011.1 Especially the
sector’s share of overall electricity consumption has been rising over time. As Figure 1A
illustrates, the fraction of electricity consumed in residential and commercial buildings in
the U.S. has increased from a total of about 52 percent in 1960 (29 percent residential and
23 percent commercial) to about 75 percent in 2010. For comparison, in California the
fraction of electricity consumed in buildings has increased from about 65 percent to 81
percent during the same period – the commercial sector currently consumes about a third
more than the residential sector in California.
Given that 46 percent of the nation’s electricity is generated using coal and 20
percent using natural gas, there is a significant greenhouse gas externality associated with
electricity consumption.2 In the absence of carbon pricing, rising electricity consumption
exacerbates the risk of severe climate change.
Despite the importance of the commercial property sector as a major consumer of
electricity, we know very little about the environmental performance of its buildings.

Lack of access to good data has limited our knowledge of the core facts – for instance,
the most comprehensive source of data, the Department of Energy’s Commercial
Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS), was last released in 2003; this
nationally representative data set offers cross-sectional information on the energy
consumption of just 5,000 buildings. There is a small body of research about commercial
building energy consumption, mostly conducted by engineers, exploring either macro
trends or analyzing small samples of buildings (see Erick Hirst and Jerry Jackson, 1977,
for an early analysis).3
In this paper, we exploit access to a unique dataset to study the electricity
consumption of a large sample of commercial buildings located in the service area of one
California electric utility. By merging the electric utility’s data on monthly electricity
consumption at the building level with detailed information on building characteristics,
occupants and macro-economic trends, we study commercial building electricity
consumption dynamics and the environmental performance of different types of
commercial buildings at a point in time.
Our data set allows us to track individual buildings’ electricity consumption over
the past decade. In the first section of the paper, we use the panel data set to test several
hypotheses related to how different buildings’ respond to changes in outdoor temperature
and macro economic shocks. Given that our data set covers the years during the recent
great recession, we investigate what types of buildings are most responsive to spikes in
the unemployment rate. We also test how the electricity consumption/temperature
gradient differs across buildings. For example, we expect that buildings in which tenants
3

This contrasts a large body of literature on energy consumption in residential dwellings, covering, for
example, the determinants of household electricity consumption (Dirk Brounen et al., 2012, Dora L. Costa
and Matthew E. Kahn, 2011) and the price-elasticity of residential energy demand (Peter C. Reiss and
Matthew W. White, 2005, 2008).

face zero marginal cost pricing will increase consumption more on hot days as compared
to buildings with tenants that pay their own bills.
By estimating separately the temperature response curves based on building type,
vintage, quality and lease structure, we document evidence that supports the “rebound
effect” hypothesis (Lorna Greening et al., 2000). Newer, high-quality buildings in which
tenants face a zero marginal cost of energy consume relatively more electricity on hotter
days. We interpret this as evidence of how technological progress in building quality is
partly offset by the ability to more cheaply achieve ambient comfort – for example with
thermostats available on each floor rather than a set temperature that is centrally
coordinated.
Using the cross-section of the data, we first explore whether new vintages of
commercial buildings are more energy efficient than observationally similar, older
vintages of commercial buildings. Given the long lasting durability of the real estate
stock, it is important to measure whether new cohorts of buildings are more efficient. It
has been documented for vehicles (Matthew E. Kahn and Joel Schwartz, 2008) and for
residential homes (Dirk Brounen, Nils Kok and John M. Quigley, 2012, Grant D.
Jacobsen and Matthew J. Kotchen, 2013), that more recent vintages consume less energy,
but in the case of commercial buildings this has not been studied.
Commercial buildings are differentiated products. Energy efficiency is just one
indicator of building quality. Other quality dimensions such as providing good lighting,
elevator service, aesthetic appeal and ambient comfort may require using more
electricity. This claim resembles a key point in Christopher R. Knittel’s (2012) study of
trends in automobile characteristics. Over time, given that gas prices have been low, he
documents that vehicles have become larger and more powerful as carmakers have
4

focused on power and safety as key elements of quality rather than focusing on
maximizing vehicle fuel economy. Similar to Knittel’s findings for vehicles, we
document that, during a time of historically low real commercial electricity prices, newer
cohorts of buildings consume more electricity than older cohorts.
The second major set of questions we explore focuses on the role that tenant
behavior and tenant incentives play in determining a building’s environmental
performance. In the case of residential housing, Levinson and Niemann (2004) document
that renters whose utilities are bundled into the rent consume more electricity than
observationally identical renters who pay their own bills. In a similar spirit, we test
whether those commercial buildings featuring renters whose contracts are full service
(and thus face a zero marginal cost) consume more electricity.
Owners of such buildings should be aware of the incentive effects and they should
have a greater incentive to invest in costly building management to increase energy
efficiency. Similar to the Nicholas Bloom et al. (2011) study of industrial energy
efficiency, we examine the impact of management quality on energy consumption by
addressing the effect of on-site human capital (i.e., the presence of an engineer). We
document that buildings where tenants face a zero marginal cost of energy are more
likely to have a building engineer on-site. More importantly, those buildings have
significantly lower electricity consumption as compared to buildings without an engineer.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the
empirical framework and the econometric models. Section III discusses the data, which
represent a unique combination of building-level electricity consumption with detailed
information on the characteristics and occupants of those buildings. Sections IV and V
provide the main results, conclusions, and policy implications of the findings.

II.

Empirical Framework
Consider the determinants of a commercial building’s electricity consumption at a

point in time. The building’s square footage and architecture will surely influence its
current consumption. Once the building is in operation, its electricity consumption will be
a function of core building energy consumption (from the requirements to heat, cool and
ventilate the building) and consumption from (unobserved) appliances installed and used
by the building occupants. For those buildings that attract tenants who tend to use a lot of
electricity, such as banks with trading floors and manufacturing companies with energyintensive equipment, the overall electricity consumption will be higher.
According to national benchmarks for building consumption (i.e., DOE’s CBECS
data base), heating, cooling, lighting and office equipment account for most of the
electricity consumption in buildings, but these estimates are of course heavily dependent
on climatic conditions. Figure 2 shows that the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning
systems (HVAC) alone account for about 65 percent of energy consumption in
commercial buildings. Our sample of commercial buildings from California (the “KKQ
Sample”) shows larger expenditures on lighting, about 30 percent, and smaller
expenditures on HVAC (also about 30 percent) than the nation-wide averages.
People who work in commercial buildings will seek to be comfortable inside
regardless of outdoor climatic conditions. For those buildings that have highly efficient
air-conditioning systems, it is unclear how hot summer temperatures affect their
electricity consumption. The Beckerian “price” of summer temperature comfort is lower
in buildings that are newer, as these tend to have more recent, efficient HVAC systems.
Facing such an incentive, on hot days, tenants in new buildings may set their thermostat
lower than tenants who know that their building has an energy inefficient HVAC system.
6

This behavioral response is an example of the “rebound effect” such that more energy
efficient technology is used more due to the substitution effect (in the case of vehicle fuel
economy, see Kurt Van Dender and Kenneth A. Small, 2007, for the case of clothes
washers, see Lucas W. Davis, 2008).4 The size of this rebound effect hinges on the
disutility of working in a hot office building, the energy efficiency of the building’s
HVAC system and the pricing scheme for whether tenants pay for marginal increases in
electricity consumption.
Lease contracts identify how the payments for operating expenses (including, but
not limited to, energy consumption) are to be allocated between the landlord and the
tenants. Lease contracts for commercial buildings commonly take one of three main
formats: full service leases, net leases, and modified gross leases. Under a full service
lease, the tenant makes one payment that covers both space rent and operating expenses.
The individual components are typically not identified. Under a net lease (often referred
to as a “triple net” lease), the tenant pays separately for space rent and the tenant’s actual
or allocated share of the specified operating expenses. Under a modified gross lease,
contracts specify a payment for the space rent and require an actual amount to be paid for
operating expenses in the first year. For later years, the landlord provides an audit of
building expenses, and the tenants pays a prorated share of the realized percentage
increase in the building expenses. So, modified gross leases and net leases share the
feature that the tenant pays a share of the building’s operating expenses, but on modified
gross leases the tenant pays a prorated share of the building’s total expenses, which are
thus are independent of the tenant’s actual energy usage. (See Dwight Jaffee et al., 2012,
4

Another possible hypothesis is that new buildings often do not have windows that open so all cooling and
heating comes from the heating and cooling system. Some of the older buildings have windows that open
so they can delay using air-conditioning in the early part of summer and stop using air-conditioning earlier
at the end of summer.

7

for a discussion.) We seek to test hypotheses about the role of incentives provided by
various contracts, such as specifying a zero marginal cost of consumption, on total
electricity consumption.5
Achieving efficient use of electricity requires certain human capital and expertise.
If experts are paid a market wage, then it is unlikely that smaller commercial buildings
will employ human capital, because the expected present discounted value of reduced
electricity bills is likely to be low. Employing a building manager is expected to deliver
significant electricity consumption reductions. Nicholas Bloom et al., (2011) document
using a survey of UK managers that manufacturing plants have a lower energy intensity
(energy consumption per dollar of value added) at plants featuring more skilled
managers. We conjecture that a similar effect plays out for commercial real estate, where
the presence of an on-site building manager or engineer might have an effect on how
efficiently a property is operated and maintained – especially in those buildings where
tenants face a zero marginal cost of energy consumption.
Finally, by calendar year and month, macro conditions will also affect
consumption, for example through climate patterns and economic conditions. During a
recession, a commercial building’s occupancy rate will decline and this will cause a
reduction in electricity consumption.

5

We assume lease contracting is exogenous and thus uncorrelated with unobserved determinants of
electricity consumption. Data access has limited research examining how contractual form affects
economic performance. Eric D. Gould et al., (2005) use a unique dataset of mall tenant contracts and show
that rental contracts are written to: efficiently price the net externality of each store, and align the incentives
to induce optimal effort by the developer and each mall store according to the externality of each store’s
effort. Arik Levinson and Scott Niemann (2004) document for a sample of residential homes that market
rents for full service, utility-included apartments are higher than for otherwise similar metered apartments.
This difference is smaller than the cost of the energy used, which indicates that landlords value the
contractual arrangement more than the potential additional energy consumption. There is no evidence on
contract form related to tenant energy consumption in the commercial building sector and we assume that
profit-maximizing landlords only offer utility-included leases if the expected energy consumption of
tenants is lower than the marginal revenue of such a contract.

8

To explain the longitudinal and cross-sectional variation in commercial building
energy consumption, we estimate the following models:
(1)

ln  Eit   TEMPt   OCCit   EMPLi  i   y   m  it

(2)

ln  Ei    Xi   di  i

In equation (1) we estimate a time-series model with building-fixed effects, in
which the dependent variable is the logarithm of the average daily electricity
consumption per square foot in month t (in kilowatt hours) for building i. TEMPt is a
vector of temperature dummies capturing the non-linear relation between outside
temperature and building energy consumption, OCCit is the occupancy rate in building i
in month t, and EMPLi is the local unemployment rate (reflecting the business cycle). i
is a variable capturing building-fixed effects, controlling for the time-invariant
characteristics of each property i. y are year-fixed effects and m are month-fixed effects,
both controlling for unobservable shocks to electricity consumption common to each
building i. it is again an error term, assumed i.i.d.
In equation (2), we estimate a cross-sectional model, with Xi as a vector of the
structural characteristics of building i, including building size, vintage, and quality. To
control for locational variation in energy consumption, we also include a variable
measuring the distance d of building i to the center of the commercial building district
(CBD). ε is an error term, assumed i.i.d.
While this paper investigates electricity consumption, we do not attempt to
estimate a demand curve for commercial electricity. Our data comes from an electric

9

utility whose pricing tiers feature little variation or increases from peak to off-peak. To
further control for average price variation, we include month fixed effects.6
In studying each of these factors, we use our unique data set that we describe
below. Despite the large number of variables that we can access, we recognize that there
will be unobserved determinants of building electricity consumption. In estimating
equation (1) using a fixed-effects regression, and estimating equation (2) using OLS, we
are assuming that the error term is not correlated with the explanatory variables. We will
return to this point below after the discussion of the data.

Data
Through a research partnership with a California electric utility, we access

monthly electricity consumption for more than 50,000 commercial accounts within the
service area. We focus on the subset of buildings that we can match to the buildings
identified in the archives maintained by the CoStar Group. The CoStar service and the
data files maintained by CoStar are advertised as “the most complete source of
commercial real estate information in the U.S,”7 and has been used extensively in
academic studies on the commercial property sector (see for example Piet M.A. Eichholtz
et al., 2010). Spanning the years 2000 to 2010, our match yielded 38,906 accounts in
3,521 buildings for which information on occupants, lease contracts and building
characteristics could be identified in CoStar. Our sample represents the population of

6

Ito (2012) documents that residential electricity consumers are more responsive to average prices than
marginal prices, estimating a price elasticity of roughly -0.05.
7
The CoStar Group maintains an extensive micro database of approximately 2.4 million U.S. commercial
properties, their locations, and hedonic characteristics, as well as the current tenancy and rental terms for
the buildings. Of these 2.4 million commercial buildings, approximately 17 percent are offices, 22 percent
are industrial properties, 34 percent is retail, 11 percent is land, and 12 percent is multifamily. A separate
file is maintained of the recent sales of commercial buildings.

10

transacted buildings (in either a lease or a sale) over the years 2000 to 2010.8 The
building types in the sample include “Office,” “Flex,” “Industrial,” and “Retail”
properties. In this study, we do not consider multi-family residential buildings.
Information on monthly electricity use is available on both consumption and
expenditures, including information on the start date of each billing cycle. To account for
variation in billing cycles, we transform electricity consumption and expenditures into
daily data, by dividing the billing cycle totals by the number of days in the cycle. If data
are available for multiple accounts within a single building (there are about three
accounts per building, on average), we then aggregate the daily energy consumption at
the building level.
Data on local daily weather conditions is collected from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Climatic Data Center. We calculate the average
maximum daily temperature during the billing cycle for each building, averaging across
accounts if there are multiple accounts within a single building.9
Information on building occupants is gathered from the CoStar Tenant module.
For each building in the sample, we collect data on the floor space occupied and the
identity of the tenants. The industry of each tenant is classified by a four-digit SIC code,

8

One reader noted that this might lead to selection bias, as the thermal quality of owner-occupied
properties may differ from “investment” properties. But the direction of the bias is not obvious: owneroccupiers may have a longer holding period, allowing for investments in building retrofits and more
energy-efficient equipment, without the requirement of short “payback periods,” which is often quoted as a
barrier to energy-efficiency upgrades. However, one could also argue that professional property investors
are more rational agents when it comes to trading off large upfront investments with savings realized over a
longer time period. And well-capitalized institutional property investors may suffer less from liquidity
constraints as compared to smaller, private real estate investors and owner-occupiers.
9
Presumably, commercial properties are occupied mostly throughout the day, so it is the maximum daily
temperature that matters for energy consumption, not the average daily temperature. A robustness check
using the average daily temperature does not yield significantly different results (results available from the
authors upon request).

11

and we aggregate the fraction of floor space occupied into thirteen groups.10 Our interest
is primarily in the behavior of government tenants and the efficiency of the buildings of
this specific tenant group.
Table I presents a description of the four types of commercial buildings in our
sample (for 2009). Average energy usage varies from about 11,000 kWh per month for
industrial buildings to three times that for office buildings. Our sample includes some
centrally located, high-rise, and high quality (“Class A”) properties, but on average the
distance to the city center is some twelve kilometers; the majority of properties are lowrise (about two stories) and fall into quality categories “B” and “C.”11
The vintage of properties in the sample is fairly young (some 27 years, on
average) as compared to the residential building stock – Dora L. Costa and Matthew E.
Kahn (2011) report for the same geography that about fifty percent of the residential
dwellings were constructed before 1970.

Electricity Consumption Dynamics
In this section, we exploit our full building panel dataset from 2000 to 2010 to

study the role of dynamic factors in determining a building’s electricity consumption, i.e.,
how a building’s electricity consumption varies as a function of climatic conditions (the
average daily maximum outdoor temperature during the billing cycle) and the business

10

The thirteen groups are defined in line with the U.S. Department of Labor SIC guide, and include:
Agriculture & Mining; Construction; Manufacturing; Transportation; Communication; Utilities;
Distribution; Retail; Financial; Services; Non-Profits; Professional Services; and Government.
11
The Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) groups commercial properties into three
classes: Class A, Class B, or Class C. These classes represent a subjective quality rating of buildings which
indicates the competitive ability of each building to attract similar types of tenants. Factors determining the
building quality include: rent, building finishes, system standards and efficiency, building amenities,
location/accessibility and market perception. See also http://www.boma.org/Resources/classifications/.

cycle (the occupancy rate and the unemployment rate). We are especially interested in the
interaction between these variables and building observable attributes such as building
type, vintage, structure quality and lease structure. To test for these effects, we estimate
stratified regressions, highlighting that our empirical approach is not merely a mechanical
engineering exercise but instead represents a reduced-form relationship capturing choices
made by self-interested economic decisions makers. For example, if a building features
many tenants who face a zero marginal cost for electricity then we expect that electricity
consumption will be more sensitive to temperature spikes. We estimate model (1) for all
buildings, and then for each property type separately. In each of the five regressions
reported in Table II, we include building-fixed effects, and month and year-fixed effects.
We document a concave relationship between a building’s occupancy rate and its
electricity consumption – buildings that are partially occupied need to be heated or
cooled as well, and there seems to be limited flexibility in “switching on or off” parts of a
building. In an ideal “smart building,” the cooling and lighting is such that areas that are
not occupied are not receiving such services. In such a building, electricity consumption
will be very low when occupancy rates are low.
Beyond affecting occupancy rates, increases in local unemployment are
associated with a reduction in commercial electricity consumption. A one percent
increase in the unemployment rate decreases commercial building electricity
consumption by about two percent.12 This may reflect the lower use-intensity of space

12

The Federal Highway Administration has documented that total miles driven decreased as the 2008
recession took place (http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/M12MTVUSM227NFWA?rid=254). Our
results complement this work and highlight the aggregate energy consumption consequences of business
cycles.

13

(for instance, corporations having reduced presence of employees in the space they
occupy).13
Columns (2) to (5) present the results stratified by building type. The regression
coefficients indicate that industrial real estate seems to be the most responsive to building
occupancy (the slope of the occupancy-electricity consumption curve is least concave).
Office buildings are least responsive. Presumably, energy consumption in office
buildings is for the largest part determined by whole building heating, cooling and
ventilation.
At the bottom of Table II, we report the coefficient for a dummy variable that
equals one if the building has recently sold. For the full sample, electricity consumption
increases by four percent when buildings are transacted. We believe that this variable
embodies two offsetting factors. A new owner is likely to make investments to raise the
quality of the building. Such investments, including a more efficient HVAC system and
more efficient lighting, could make the building more energy efficient. Conversely,
improvements in quality that result in better HVAC and lighting systems may induce
greater use – a “rebound effect” for commercial buildings.
We plot the coefficients on the temperature-fixed effects in Figure 3, estimating
separately the temperature response curves based on building type, vintage, quality, and
lease structure.14 Controlling for occupancy, electricity consumption is higher during
those months when it is very hot. The differentials are quite large: for office buildings,
monthly consumption is 35 percent higher when the temperature is 97F, on average (the

13

Recent macroeconomic research by Vernon Henderson et al. (2011) documents a strong correlation
between “night lights” and the overall economic performance of an economy.
14
Following Anin Aroonruengsawat and Maximilian Auffhammer (2011), we split the temperature
distribution into deciles, further decomposing the upper and bottom decile into the first, fifth, ninety-fifth
and ninety-ninth percentile.

14

ninety-ninth percentile), relative to when the temperature is 65F. For industrial buildings
this differential is less pronounced – the energy consumption is 23 percent higher at the
ninety-ninth percentile.
Figures 3B and 3C plot the temperature response curves based on vintage and
building quality. Quite clearly, buildings of higher quality and those that were
constructed more recently are more responsive to temperature shocks – controlling for
occupancy and unemployment and including building-fixed effects. This finding is in line
with our “behavioral hypothesis” on a rebound effect in cooling buildings, predicting that
new buildings will have higher electricity consumption on hot days than older buildings.
Figure 3D shows how variations in temperature affect commercial building
electricity consumption in buildings with different lease structures. In buildings with
triple-net leases, tenants are directly responsible for energy costs, whereas in buildings
with full service lease contracts, tenants pay a lump sum for total housing costs, including
energy and other service costs. The curves show that for buildings where tenants face a
zero marginal cost for energy consumption, the response to increases in outside
temperature starts at lower temperatures and increases more rapidly. One explanation for
this finding may be that the indoor thermostat is set at a lower, more comfortable
temperature when tenants do not face a marginal cost for energy consumption.

B.

Cross-Sectional Variation in Commercial Building Electricity Consumption
In this section, we report estimates of equation (2). These cross-sectional

regressions are informative about the association between building attributes, contract
incentives, and management human capital under the standard orthogonality condition.
In this case, we must assume that tenants are not sorting on unobserved demand for
15

energy efficiency.15 To appreciate the implications of this assumption, consider a case in
which the commercial real estate pricing gradient is such that more energy efficient
buildings and buildings offering a full lease contract command a price premium. In this
case, the most energy intensive tenants will self select and choose to locate in the most
energy efficient buildings or in buildings for which electricity bills are bundled into the
rent. A researcher who estimates electricity consumption regressions using OLS will
under-estimate the causal effect of building attributes that reflect energy efficiency
because of the tenant mix of “hogs” that will cluster in such “green” buildings.
Our information on the distribution of industries across buildings provides some
insight into the extent of tenant sorting based on building quality, energy efficiency, and
lease contract structure. Table III provides some descriptive statistics on the average
percentage of each of the fourteen of industries in our sample of commercial buildings.
Although the industry averages mask the underlying heterogeneity in the energy intensity
of individual tenants, these simple statistics give some insight into the sorting of tenant
types based on observable characteristics. Panel A shows that government tenants are
present in some four percent of the commercial office buildings in our sample.
Government tenants, as well as financial services, are clustered into higher quality, Class
A buildings.
Although we do not have priors about the energy intensity of industries, one could
expect that high tech industries, such as data processing, are more energy intensive,
15

In the regressions below, we will be controlling for the building’s age and size. Our implicit assumption
is that within these observable categories, tenants sort "at random" across the buildings. Indeed, Dirk
Brounen and Nils Kok (2011) document that private homeowners are uninformed about the thermal quality
of residential dwellings – information provided by EU energy performance certificates resolves this
information asymmetry and is capitalized at the time of sale. In the case of the California electric utility that
we study, there is no equivalent energy performance certificate that is provided to potential tenants of the
building or to potential buyers. This suggests that there are significant costs to acquiring information about
different buildings’ energy efficiency. Given that electricity costs are a relatively small share of a firm’s
cost of doing business, we expect that few firms will explicitly locate based on this criterion.

16

whereas tenants in the professional services industry (including legal services, accounting
and business services) consume less energy. Panel B provides more insight into the
sorting of tenants based on the energy efficiency characteristics and lease contract type of
commercial office buildings. Tenants in the data processing industry are more prevalent
in less efficient, non-Energy-Star rated buildings, whereas government tenants and the
professional service sector seem to sort into more efficient buildings. Tenants from these
industries are also more likely to be present in buildings with full-service lease contracts.
In Table IV, we provide the results from estimating equation (2) using monthly
data from calendar year 2009 to explaining commercial buildings’ electricity
consumption. We include month-fixed effects to capture monthly variations in
temperature and to account for the peak and off-peak pricing schedule at the utility. We
first address how the structural attributes of commercial properties correlate with
electricity consumption. The explanatory power of the basic model presented in Column
(1) is reasonable, with some 34 percent of the variation explained. Large buildings
consume more electricity. Although the coefficient on building size indicates that there is
some economies of scale in heating and cooling buildings, the “large building” dummy
confirms that buildings larger than 50,000 sq.ft. behave differently than their smaller
counterparts, consuming about 30 percent more electricity, on average. Presumably,
heating and cooling of large structures requires additional equipment to bridge large
vertical distances, offsetting otherwise beneficial economies of scale.

Cohort Effects and Structure Quality
In Column (1), we document that newer buildings consume more electricity.
Buildings constructed before 1960 are slightly less efficient than those constructed during

the 1960-1970 period, but buildings that are 40 years or younger consistently consume
more electricity than old buildings.16 These findings contrast with results examining
vintage effects for residential housing in California that document increased energy
efficiency for the most recent vintages (Dora L. Costa and Matthew E. Kahn, 2011). The
vintage effect has taken place during a time of declining electricity prices. During the
1960-2010 period, for tenants in commercial buildings, average real electricity prices
decreased by fourteen percent.17
We note that the electricity consumption of commercial buildings constructed
recently (with a vintage less than ten years) is slightly lower as compared to those
properties constructed more than ten years ago. (Some have asserted that the recent
improvement in energy use intensity is a result of strict legislation, e.g., California’s Title
24 building energy efficiency program, but we cannot statistically assess these claims.)
Like vintage, renovation has a distinct effect on commercial building energy
consumption. Renovated buildings feature a 27 percent higher electricity consumption
than similarly sized buildings. Also, as shown in Column (2) of Table IV, “Class A” real
estate consumes twenty percent more electricity than “Class C” real estate.
The findings on building vintage and building quality are consistent with the
hypothesis that electricity consumption and building quality are complements, not
substitutes. Technological progress may reduce the energy demand from heating, cooling
and ventilating the base building, but the increase in appliances and quality attributes

16

We recognize that at any point in time year built and building age are collinear. We have exploited the
panel nature of our 2000 to 2010 data to test for aging effects. In results available on request, we have
estimated versions of equation (1) in which we include building fixed effects and an age of building
variable. The age coefficient is 0.027 and is statistically insignificant with a t-statistic of 0.53. This finding
raises our confidence that the year built coefficients we report represent vintage effects rather than a
convolution of vintage and aging effects.

(e.g., a nicer lobby, more elevators, the ability of tenants to independently adapt comfort
temperature, etc.) actually increases energy consumption. This is comparable to recent
work on automobiles, which has documented that technological progress in fuel economy
has been partially offset by the increase in vehicle weight and engine power (Christopher
R. Knittel, 2012).

Contract Incentives and Human Capital
In Table V, we exploit the rich set of observables in the CoStar database to
explore in more detail the role that building occupants, lease structures and human capital
play in determining electricity consumption. In column (1), we add a vector of lease
contract attributes to the model. The results show that contracting matters for energy
consumption: the variable indicating the presence of a triple net lease has a negative
coefficient of about 17 percent.18 This finding is consistent with our hypothesis that
tenants facing marginal costs for energy consumption have an incentive to conserve. For
occupants with full service rental contracts, energy consumption is significantly higher as
compared to occupants with a “modified gross” rental contract, which confirms that
energy conservation is negatively affected if tenants do not face the marginal cost of
additional consumption.
We can also identify buildings that have a significant share of government
occupants. If government tenants have “soft budget constraints,” then we predict that
such tenants should consume more electricity as they can pass on the costs to taxpayers
(Janos Kornai et al., 2003). As shown in column (2) of Table V, the variable measuring

18

Again, our findings are based on the assumption that lease contract terms are exogenous. If energyintensive tenants sort into buildings where they face zero marginal cost for electricity consumption, our
results reflect a combination of selection and treatment effects, rather than treatment effects alone.

19

the fraction of a building occupied by a government tenant dummy is positive. If a
building is fully occupied by a government tenant, the energy consumption in that
building is about 38 percent higher as compared to a building with commercial tenants.
This result is obtained when controlled for building quality, but of course, building
maintenance and the quality of equipment and appliances cannot be unobserved in our
dataset.
In columns (2) and (3), we include a variable measuring the presence of on-site
building management. Presumably, human capital is important in building energy
efficiency optimization, and having an engineer on-site should be related negatively to
commercial building energy consumption. Especially for buildings with a full-service
lease structure, owners should be aware of the adverse incentive effects and they should
have a greater incentive to invest in costly building management to increase energy
efficiency. On-site management is present for some 17 percent of full-service buildings,
whereas on-site management is present for just two percent of triple-net buildings.19 The
coefficient for “On-Site Management” shows that building management has a positive
effect on commercial building energy efficiency, reducing energy consumption by some
7-8 percent – this finding is in line with the impact of management quality at corporations
on the energy intensity of manufacturing plants, as documented by Nicholas Bloom et al.
(2011).
The number of “green” buildings (certified by US Green Building Council and/or
the DOE) has been growing rapidly over the past decade (Nils Kok et al., 2011), but the
actual energy efficiency of such buildings has been subject to popular debate. To further
investigate this issue, we match our dataset with the Energy-Star-files maintained by the
19

A t-test shows that the difference between these means is statistically significant from zero at the 1percent level.

20

EPA and the DOE. A very small fraction of the properties in our dataset has obtained an
Energy Star label – some thirty buildings. In columns (3) and (4), we add a binary
variable indicating the award of an Energy Star. The results show that, in a fully occupied
building, an Energy-Star-labeled building consumes some 34 percent less energy as
compared to an otherwise similar building. This is surprisingly similar to conservation
claims made by the EPA (the Energy Star label is marketed as a commitment to
conservation and environmental stewardship, but it is also touted as a vehicle for
reducing building costs and for demonstrating superior management skill).

V.

Conclusion
The durable building stock in the United States is a major consumer of electricity.

The Energy Information Agency predicts that between the years 2005 and 2030,
residential electricity consumption will increase by 39 percent, industrial consumption
will increase by 17 percent, and commercial electricity consumption will increase by 63
percent.20 In the absence of a carbon tax, such increased consumption will have
significant greenhouse gas externality consequences. Given these facts, it is surprising
how little we know about commercial building electricity consumption. Data collection
has hindered such research, as micro data on commercial building energy consumption is
rare. (The only such source, the CBECS data assembled by the DOE, is now nine years
out of date.) To fill this void, we partnered with a major California electric utility and
merged information on electricity consumption at the building level with detailed
physical attributes of the building. Using panel data on each building’s monthly

electricity consumption, we test a number of hypotheses seeking to investigate the time
series and cross-sectional determinants of electricity consumption.
We document that, since 1970, there is an inverse relation between building
vintage (and quality) and electricity consumption. Moreover, newer, high-quality
building respond faster to changes in outdoor temperature, leading to increased energy
consumption. These findings stand in contrast with evidence on energy consumption
trends for residential structures: it has been documented for homes that new vintages
have lower electricity consumption, controlling for interior square footage.
We have four explanations for our results. First, although building codes for
commercial buildings have been developed and implemented in some states across the
nation,21 increases in the energy efficiency of commercial buildings (through new
construction and retrofits of existing structures) mainly affects energy consumption for
space heating (and, to a lesser extent, space cooling). Energy consumption from airconditioning, lighting and “other uses” are not affected. Building codes thus have an
impact on a very small fraction of total building energy consumption.22 Second, and
closely related, the composition of the energy mix used in buildings has changed quite
substantially over the past decades. The natural gas intensity has been falling as a result
of fuel switching from end uses formerly fueled by gas (e.g., cooking and water heating),
which has lead to an increase in electricity consumption. Third, the “computerization” of
society is thought to comprise a significant amount of the recent increase in electricity
use in the commercial building sector. This includes the accelerated diffusion of personal
21

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) started to
develop commercial building energy codes in 1975. These codes are known as “Standard 90.1.” Since the
passage of the Energy Policy Act in 1992, the Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for tracking
progress in the adoption of building codes. The latest commercial building code aims to achieve a 25
percent reduction in energy consumption over the standard adopted in 1975.

computers, printers, copiers and other equipment that was virtually non-existent before
1960. Fourth, in buildings with more efficient heating, cooling and ventilation systems,
the behavioral response of building tenants may lead to more intensive use of such
equipment, as the marginal price of “comfort” is lower – a “rebound” effect for
commercial buildings.
Our finding of a positive correlation between commercial building quality and
electricity consumption means that the commercial’s share of total electricity
consumption is likely to rise over time both due to a declining residential share and rising
commercial consumption. This suggests that future energy efficiency policies must focus
more explicitly on the commercial sector, using not just prescriptive building codes and
voluntary “green” certification programs, but also by explicitly taking into account the
behavioral response of occupants.
Our results on building management offer a more optimistic message. If human
capital, reflected in better building management, yields improved environmental
performance in commercial structures, then nudging building owners towards having a
well-trained, experienced building management team makes the energy decisions auger
well for future improved environmental outcomes.
