ABSTRACT
Physicians prescribing drugs for patients with schizophrenia and related conditions are remarkably
concentrated in their choice among antipsychotic drugs. In 2007 the single antipsychotic drug prescribed
by a physician accounted for 66% of all antipsychotic prescriptions written by that physician. Which
particular branded antipsychotic was the prescriber's "favorite" varied widely across physicians, i.e.
physician prescribing concentration patterns are diverse. Building on Frank and Zeckhauser's [2007]
characterization of physician treatments varying from "custom made" to "ready-to-wear", we construct
a model of physician learning that generates a number of hypotheses. Using 2007 annual antipsychotic
prescribing behavior on 17,652 physicians from IMS Health, we evaluate these predictions empirically.
While physician prescribing behavior is generally quite concentrated, prescribers having greater volumes,
those with training in psychiatry, male prescribers, and those not approaching retirement age tend
to have less concentrated prescribing patterns.

INTRODUCTION
Consider a physician seeing a patient with a confirmed diagnosis for which a number of

alternative pharmaceutical treatments are available. Patient response to the various treatments is
idiosyncratic and unpredictable in terms of both efficacy and side effects, and there is little clinical
evidentiary literature upon which the physician can base an ex ante choice among the alternative drug
treatments. What treatment algorithms might the physician employ to gather evidence and learn
regarding the efficacy and tolerability of the variety of possible drug therapies for the patient?
Given this uncertainty and imperfect information, one possibility is for the physician to
concentrate prescribing behavior on a single drug. In this way the physician engages in learning by
doing, observes responses to that drug, adjusts dosage strength as warranted, and thereby exploits
his/her accumulating knowledge and experience. Simultaneously the physician could also counsel the
patient on the efficacy and side effect responses he/she might experience, thereby improving patient
adherence and outcomes, and engaging the patient to help maintain symptom remission.
Alternatively, the physician might diversify prescribing across several drugs in an attempt to
personalize the treatment and find the best match between the patient and the drug. Specifically,
based on information from the patient’s history, limited experience with several other drugs, the
existing scientific and clinical literature, conversations with fellow medical professionals in the local and
larger geographical community, and perhaps interactions with pharmaceutical sales representatives, the
physician might select the therapy that a priori appears to be the best match with the particular
patient’s characteristics.
The physician can learn from either exploiting or exploring, concentrating or diversifying,
prescribing “ready‐to‐wear“vs. “custom‐made” treatments.1 Physicians continually face this tradeoff as
they treat patients and invest in learning about available treatments. How does the choice along this
treatment diversity continuum vary by the physician’s specialty, volume of patients treated, age and

Diverse Concentration
training? If physicians concentrate their prescribing, is there a convergence and relative unanimity on
their choice of a favorite drug, or is concentration non‐uniform? Are there persistent geographic
differences in physician prescribing behavior? If the set of prescribed drugs is diverse, do the physician’s
drug utilization shares mimic regional or national shares? These are the issues we address in this
research, with an application to a particular therapeutic class of drugs known as antipsychotics. The
issues are important, for understanding how physicians respond to new product launches, novel
scientific and comparative effectiveness information, their own experience, and safety messages from
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is critical to managing the diffusion of medical information, and
has significant clinical adoption and public health implications as well.
That physician prescribing behavior is relatively concentrated has been documented by, among
others, Frank and Zeckhauser [2007].2 They report that among 1372 primary care physicians surveyed in
2004, the fraction of prescriptions accounted for by the most prescribed medication used by the
physician was generally quite high across four acute and five chronic conditions (averaging 60%), but
was about 13 percentage points lower for chronic than acute conditions. More generally, while in some
cases patient demographic factors affected physician treatment variability, patient clinical factors played
a startlingly minor role. Physician “read‐to‐wear” treatment norms in some cases could be perceived as
“as sensible response to complex decision‐making”, but in other cases could be viewed as “disturbing”
and “based on idiosyncratic physician‐specific preferences or severe biases in the application of
heuristics.”3 Our research extends their analysis in several ways.4 We focus on antipsychotics ‐‐
medicines treating primarily chronic conditions, and examine prescriber behavior across a much larger
number and variety of specialties. We also put forward a theoretical framework based on the Bayesian
learning model that enables us to construct and examine several additional hypotheses empirically.
However, unlike Frank and Zeckhauser, we only observe physicians, and not the patients they treat.

2

Diverse Concentration
We proceed as follows. We first provide a brief background on several generations of
antipsychotic drugs and the illnesses they treat. We then report preliminary evidence on concentrated
vs. diversified prescribing behavior, and utilize our initial findings on “diverse concentration” to put
forward a theoretical framework that enables us to construct several hypotheses. After discussing the
data and econometric framework, we present a substantial set of empirical findings. We conclude by
relating our findings to the geographical variation literature, and suggest directions for future research.
II.

ANTIPSYCHOTICS FOR THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AND RELATED CONDITIONS
Schizophrenia is an incurable mental illness. It is characterized by “gross distortions of reality,

disturbances of language and communications, withdrawal from social interaction, and disorganization
and fragmentation of thought, perception and emotional reaction”.5 Symptoms are both positive
(hallucinations, delusions, voices) and negative (depression, lack of emotion). The prevalence of
schizophrenia is 1‐2%, with genetic factors at play but otherwise unknown etiology. The illness tends to
strike males in late teens and early twenties, and females five or so years later. As the illness continues,
persons with schizophrenia frequently experience unemployment, lose contact with their family, and
become homeless; a substantial proportion experience periods of incarceration.6
Because schizophrenia is a chronic illness affecting virtually all aspects of life of affected
persons, the goals of treatment are to reduce or eliminate symptoms, maximize quality of life and
adaptive functioning, and to promote and maintain recovery from the adverse effects of illness to the
maximum extent possible.7 In the US, Medicaid is the largest payer of medical and drug benefits to
people with schizophrenia.8
From 1955 up through the early 1990s, the mainstays of pharmacological treatment of
schizophrenia were conventional or typical antipsychotic (also called neuroleptic) drugs that were more
effective in treating the positive than the negative symptoms, but frequently resulted in extrapyramidal
side effects such as tardive dyskinesia (an involuntary movement disorder most often characterized by
3

Diverse Concentration
puckering of the lips and tongue, or writhing of the arms or legs), that may persist even after the drug is
discontinued, and for which currently there is no effective treatment. In 1989, Clozaril (generic name
clozapine) was introduced into the U.S. as the first in a new therapeutic class of drugs called atypical
antipsychotics; this drug has also been dubbed a first generation atypical (FGA). Although judged by
many still to be the most effective among all antipsychotic drugs, for 1‐2% of individuals taking clozapine
a potentially fatal condition called agranulocytosis occurs (drop in the white blood cell count, leaving the
immune system potentially compromised). Patients taking clozapine must therefore have their white
blood cell count measured by a laboratory test on a regular basis, and satisfactory laboratory test results
must be communicated to the pharmacist before a prescription can be dispensed. For this reason,
currently clozapine is generally used only for individuals who do not respond to other antipsychotic
treatments.9
Between 1993 and 2002, five so‐called second generation atypical (“SGA”) antipsychotic
molecules were approved by the FDA and launched in the US, including Risperdal (risperidone, 1993),
Zyprexa (olanzapine, 1996), Seroquel (quetiapine, 1997), Geodon (ziprasidone, 2001) and Abilify
(aripiprazole, 2002). Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association state that although each of
these five second generation atypicals is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia (some later also
received FDA approval for treatment of bipolar disease, major depressive disorder, as well as various
pediatric/adolescent patient subpopulation approvals), they also note that “In addition to having
therapeutic effects, both first‐ and second‐generation antipsychotic agents can cause a broad spectrum
of side effects. Side effects are a crucial aspect of treatment because they often determine medication
choice and are a primary reason for medication discontinuation.”10
Initially these SGAs were perceived as having similar efficacy for positive symptoms and superior
efficacy for negative symptoms relative to FGAs, but without the FGA extrapyramidal and
agranulocytosis side effects. However, beginning in about 2001‐2002 and continuing to the present, a
4

Diverse Concentration
literature has developed regarding the association of SGAs with weight gain and the onset of diabetes,
along with related metabolic syndrome side effects, particularly associated with the use of Zyprexa and
clozapine and less so for Risperdal. Various professional treatment guidelines have counseled close
scrutiny of individuals prescribed Zyprexa, clozapine and Risperdal. The FDA has ordered manufacturers
to add bolded and boxed warnings to the product labels, initially for all atypicals, and later, to both
typical and atypical antipsychotic labels. The labels have been augmented further with warnings
regarding antipsychotic treatment of elderly patients having dementia, since this subpopulation appears
to be at greater risk for stroke and death.11

Despite this controversy, as seen in Figure 1, based on a 10% random sample of all antipsychotic
prescribers in the U.S. (more data details below), the number of atypical antipsychotic prescriptions
dispensed between 1996 and 2007 increased about sevenfold from about 400,000 in 1996 to 2,800,000
in 2007, even as the number of conventional or typical antipsychotic prescriptions fell 45% from
1,100,000 in 1996 to about 500,000 in 2003, and has stabilized at that level since then.12 As a share of
5

Diverse Concentration
all antipsychotic prescriptions, the atypical share more than tripled from about 27% in 1996 to 85% in
2007. It is also noteworthy that despite all the concerns about the safety and efficacy of antipsychotics,
the total number of antipsychotic prescriptions dispensed in this 10% random sample – typical plus
atypical – more than doubled between 1996 and 2007, from about 1,500,000 to about 3,300,000, an
average annual growth rate (AAGR) of 7.4%.
III.

PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE ON CONCENTRATED VS. DIVERSIFIED PRESCRIBING BEHAVIOR
Although manufacturers received approval to market reformulated versions of several SGAs in

the last decade, no new major antipsychotic products were launched in the US during the five years
leading up to our 2007 sample period . Over the last fifteen years, controversy regarding relative
efficacy and tolerability of the six atypicals has persisted, but prescribers have learned about these drugs
by observing how their patients responded, reading the clinical literature, and interacting with other
professionals. These experiences have enabled prescribers to select a location along the diversification‐
concentration prescribing continuum. By 2007, five years after the launch of the last SGA, how
concentrated or diversified was their prescribing behavior? We have two striking initial findings.
First, concentration appears to be the dominant behavior. Among prescribers who wrote at
least one atypical antipsychotic prescription in 2007, the average share of atypical prescriptions written
for the prescriber’s favorite antipsychotic was 66%. Second, rather than exhibiting “herding” behavior,
prescribers are quite diverse in their concentration behavior, choosing different favorite drugs, i.e.,
doing it “my way”. To mitigate the possible impacts of very low volume prescribers, we limit the sample
to all prescribers who in 2007 wrote at least 12 prescriptions for an antipsychotic (at least one a month),
at least one of which was an atypical. When we further limit the sample to very highly concentrated
prescribers – those for whom in 2007 at least 75% of the atypical prescriptions written were for one
drug (n=6,175), we find 55% (3,379) chose Seroquel as their favorite drug, 28% (1,733) concentrated on
Risperdal, 13% (775) focused on Zyprexa, 3% (173) on Abilify, 2% (93) on Geodon, and 0.4% (22) on
6

Diverse Concentration
clozapine.13 Incidentally, 2007 national market shares of the six atypicals were Seroquel 36.2%,
Risperdal 27.2%, Abilify 13.8%, Zyprexa 13.1%, Geodon 7.3%, and clozapine 2.4%.
We conclude from this initial data examination that relatively concentrated prescribing behavior
is the norm for atypical antipsychotics (a preference for one therapy for almost all patients), but that
there is substantial diversity among prescribers concerning what is their favorite drug. These initial
diverse prescriber concentration behavior findings raise an intriguing issue: The highly publicized
regional variation literature documents that within region treatments of selected conditions for
Medicare patients are relatively homogeneous compared to very large between region differences in
treatments and costs.14 Is there a corresponding between‐region variability in antipsychotic prescribing
behavior, or is most variability physician‐specific and are regions relatively homogeneous? How does
prescribing concentration vary with geographical aggregation? To address this issue, we need to define
alternative regional geographical aggregates, and develop a measure of concentration behavior.
Although county, state and national aggregates are obvious, within the Dartmouth Atlas Project
hospital referral regions (HRRs) have played a prominent role. HRRs represent regional health care
markets for tertiary medical care that generally require the services of a major referral center, primarily
for major cardiovascular surgery procedures and neurosurgery; HRRs have been developed by and are
maintained by the Dartmouth Atlas Project.15 HRRs may cross state and county borders because they
are determined solely by migration patterns of patients. To relate our initial findings to the regional
variation literature, we will examine mean antipsychotic prescriber concentration (and its variability)
alternatively at the individual prescriber, county, HRR, state and national levels.
There are various ways one can measure the concentration behavior of prescriber i, Ci. Within
the economics literature, a well‐known measure of industry concentration is the Herfindahl‐Hirschman
Index (HHI). For a given industry or market, first rank the j = 1,…J firms by some measure of size (e.g.,
revenues, employment, profits) with the first being the largest firm and the last the smallest. Then for
7

Diverse Concentration
each firm compute its industry share sj as its size measure divided by the total industry size measure,
where the sj share is between 0 and 100. Then square the shares and sum up over the j firms, yielding
HHI = ∑j sj2. Note that the HHI ranges from zero to 10,000, with higher HHIs indicating greater
concentration.16 In the current context of individual physician prescribing behavior, we will use the
number of prescriptions written for a particular drug molecule divided by the total number of
antipsychotic prescriptions written by the prescriber in 2007 to compute shares and then construct
HHIs. Therefore a high HHI means that the individual prescriber is using one or at most several drugs
predominately, while a low HHI implies s/he prescribes in a more varied manner.17 Using the same
sample of 19,537 prescribers who prescribed at least 12 antipsychotics in 2007, we compute mean HHIs
and their variability (both standard deviations and coefficients of variation) at alternative levels of
regional aggregation. Results are given in Table 1.

_____________________________________________________________________________________
At the individual prescriber level, prescribing behavior is very concentrated (HHI is almost 5000),
but there is also substantial variability, with the coefficient of variation being just over 0.5. However, as
one aggregates into larger regions, not only is less concentrated prescribing observed, but so too is less
relative variability, particularly as one moves from the county to the HRR geographical aggregate. In
particular, 95% of the difference in mean HHI between individual prescriber and national level shares
8

Diverse Concentration
disappears at the HRR level, and 99% disappears at the state level. In his survey of regional variability of
various surgical procedures, Phelps [1992, pp. 25‐26] categorizes coefficients of variation in the 0.1 to
0.2 range as revealing “low variability”, while those at 0.4 and greater are termed “high variability”
procedures. Within that classification scheme, antipsychotic prescribing behavior is highly variable at
the individual prescriber and county level, but is low variability behavior at the HRR and larger regional
aggregates. We conclude that while prescribing behavior is relatively concentrated at the level of the
individual prescriber, and is considerably less concentrated at the county level, at both the individual
prescriber and county level, antipsychotic prescribing behavior is highly variable. At the HRR level of
aggregation, however, there is relatively little between‐region variability, and prescription drug shares
closely mimic national trends.
This preliminary evidence leads us to focus on individual prescriber rather than HRR variability,
and to inquire what theory of individual prescriber learning and treatment behavior can help us
understand this non‐uniform concentration behavior. Is the theory also able to generate some
predictions that can be assessed empirically? To those issues we now turn our attention.
IV.

TOWARDS A THEORY OF PRESCRIBER LEARNING AND TREATMENT BEHAVIOR
A.

ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS FOR DIFFERENTIALLY CONCENTRATED PRESCRIBING

We observe that when physicians see similar patients with schizophrenia the treatments they
prescribe for these patients vary relatively little within a given prescriber practice, but vary greatly
across individual prescriber practices. This is consistent with the “ready‐to‐wear” vs. “custom‐made”
primary care physician behavior observed by Frank and Zeckhauser [2007], but is particularly striking
here because schizophrenia and related illnesses require chronic maintenance rather than acute,
episodic treatment. The economics and strategy literature offers many explanations for different actors
persistently responding in diverse manners when faced with the same situations. These explanations

9

Diverse Concentration
generally fall into one of the following four groups: perception, motivation, administration, and
inspiration, which we now briefly summarize.18
Perception:
Physicians may disagree about the best treatment for a particular patient. For example, suppose
two medical studies arrived at different conclusions. One physician reads only one study, while the
other physician only reads the other. In this case, both physicians are choosing what they believe is the
best treatment for their patients and yet still choose to treat them in different ways. Physicians may
persist in choosing different treatment regimes as long as they do not observe the outcomes of the
other physician’s patients, or gain access to the article read only by the other physician.
Motivation:
If physicians instead agreed on the most appropriate treatment but do not have the motivation
to prescribe the optimal treatments for their patients, one may also observe very different prescribing
decisions for each physician. If there is weak competition among physicians for patients, if knowledge
concerning which physicians are obtaining the most successful outcomes for their patients is difficult to
obtain, and/or if physicians’ prescribing behavior is reinforced by contacts with pharmaceutical sales
representatives vying for the allegiance of each prescriber, then to the extent physician‐sales
representative alliances were heterogeneous, we would expect to observe strong brand allegiances
among physicians, and that these allegiances would be to different medicines.19
Administration:
Alternatively, it could be that physicians have reached a consensus regarding what is the best
treatment regime for a patient, and they may also want to give their patients the best care possible, but
physicians face administrative or financial constraints preventing them from giving their patients the
best treatment. For example, if the best treatment is drug A but only drug B is covered by a particular
health plan’s formulary, one may observe physicians using drug A whenever they can and drug B in all
10

Diverse Concentration
other cases. In this context one would observe very different prescribing behavior across physicians
because their patients have different insurance coverage. In the context of antipsychotic drugs,
however, Medicaid (the dominant payer for patients with schizophrenia), placed little if any restrictions
on choice among the atypicals during our 2007 sample period; Medicare Part D required that any
private prescription drug plan offer all but one of the atypical antipsychotic drugs on its formulary, and
many other private insurers had similar formulary provisions.20
Inspiration:
Yet another alternative is that physicians may have prior beliefs about what is the best
treatment for their patient, but they may either need to learn more about the drug to use it effectively
or there may be considerable uncertainty regarding whether they have correct beliefs concerning the
efficacy and tolerability of each drug. In either context, as physicians treat more patients they learn
from patients’ responses to each drug.
Although we do not a priori rule out the first three explanations underlying differentially
concentrated prescribing behavior, in the following section we outline a model that formalizes one
version of the inspiration intuition and offers a basic framework leading to our subsequent more
detailed empirical analyses. It also builds on the Frank and Zeckhauser [2007] “sensible‐use‐of‐norms”
hypothesis.
B. A MODEL OF PRESCRIBER LEARNING WITH INCOMPLETE INFORMATION
Assume patients arrive sequentially to be seen by a physician and are indexed by p‫ א‬N={1, 2,…} .
A new patient arrives at a physician’s office at the beginning of each time interval w, i.e. patient p
arrives at the physician’s office at the point in time pw, w later than patient p‐1 who arrived at (p‐1)w.
Let the continuous time discount rate be given by r. A patient p has the combination of symptoms
observable by the physician and denoted by s where s is randomly drawn from the set of all possible
symptoms, S = {1 … S}. The set of available drugs that treat these symptoms consists of D= {1 … D}. The
11

Diverse Concentration
maximum possible benefit of drug d for symptom s is Bsd. The best drug treatment for a given set of
symptoms is indicated by d*(s), i.e. Bsd*(s) > Bsd for all d ≠ d*(s). Assume the physician knows Bsd for all
combinations of s in S and d in D.
The therapy for a patient is comprised not only of the drug, d, that the physician prescribes, but
also any complementary actions, a, that the physician undertakes, such as adjusting the dosage of the
drug (a process known as titrating), or any actions that affect the patient’s adherence and outcomes,
such as communicating information on expected possible side effects and their duration. In order to
achieve the maximum potential benefit from a drug, the physician must simultaneously undertake the
ideal complementary actions. In particular, the realized effectiveness of drug d prescribed for patient p
with symptoms s is
bsdp= Bsd[1 – (a – xdp)2] ,

(1)

where a denotes complementary actions the physician undertakes, and
xdp = θd + εdp .

(2)

We assume θd and εdp are independent normally distributed random variables for all d and p, with mean
zero and variances σ2d and σ2ε, respectively.
This formulation implies that the maximum benefit of a drug is achieved when a = xdp. As
|a ‐xdp| increases, the realized benefit from drug d, bsdp, decreases. Given the squared difference, the
decrease in realized benefit occurs at an increasing rate with the size of the gap.
After prescribing drug d to patient p and undertaking complementary actions a, the physician
observes xdp. That is, the physician observes the complementary action that would have been optimal
for the patient just treated, given the drug that was prescribed for that patient. Note that the physician
does not observe xd’p for d’≠d (i.e., the ideal actions had that patient been given another drug) or xdp’ for
p’≠p (i.e., the ideal actions for another patient given that drug).

12

Diverse Concentration
Recall the physician knows the maximum potential benefit from each drug Bsd as well as the
distribution from which θd and εdp are drawn. Therefore the only uncertainty the physician faces is what
complementary actions will work best for a particular drug and a particular patient. Jovanovic and
Nyarko (1996) have a similar feature in their model. This model differs from the multi‐armed bandit
model in which the effectiveness of each drug Bsd would be unknown and there would be no
complementary actions.
It is useful to discuss the intuition underlying this model. Here the physician learns by taking
different complementary actions a when prescribing drug d and observing afterwards the impact on
that patient, xdp. The fact that the physician does not observe θd implies that s/he typically cannot learn
everything s/he needs to know about a drug from treating a single patient. Note that for simplicity we
assume that the best action that the physician can potentially learn to make, θd, depends only on the
drug prescribed but not on the symptoms. Symptoms in turn determine which drug has the highest
potential for giving a patient the best outcomes, d*(s). We have also assumed that the speed of
learning the complementary action θd for each drug d depends on only how often the physician
prescribes drug d, not on the patients presenting with symptoms for whom s/he prescribes this drug.
Denote the physician’s prescription and outcome history through patient p by hp = (h1,p, h2,p, …,
hd,p, …, hD,p ) where hd,p,is determined recursively by:
hd,p

= empty if p=0;
= hd,p‐1 if dp(sp, hp‐1)  d and p>0; and
= (hd,p‐1, xdp) if dp(sp, hp‐1) = d and p>0.

(3)

The physician’s policy is to choose a drug, dp(s, hp‐1), and complementary actions, ap(d, hp‐1), for each
patient p with symptom s and each history hp‐1. Since complementary actions a do not affect learning
about θd, the optimal complementary actions a and physician’s expected per patient payoff from patient
p are given by:
13

Diverse Concentration
ap(hp‐1)

= E[θd| hd,p‐1], and

E[bsdp| hd,p‐1]

= Bsd ( 1 ‐ Var(θd| hd,p‐1) ‐ σε 2 ).

(4)

From these equations we see that the more times a physician has used drug d, the closer s/he will
expect to be to achieving the second‐best benefits of the drug d on a patient with symptoms s,
Bsd(1‐ σε 2).
If the physician is myopic (i.e., s/he only cares about the current patient’s outcome and not
about any future patients’ outcomes), then the optimal prescribing decision is simply
dp, (sp,,hp‐1) = argmaxE[bsdp |hp 1 ] .

We now consider the empirical predictions emanating from this learning model.
C. PREDICTIONS OF THE MODEL
Suppose first that w is large (i.e., the physician is a low‐volume prescriber). In this case, over
time the physician will concentrate on a subset of drugs. Moreover, this subset of drugs will depend on
the initial history of idiosyncratic patients’ symptoms presented to the physician. Both the number of
drugs and the identity of the drugs for which the physician concentrates depend on the initial history of
symptom presentation to the physician. The intuition behind this is as follows. If the physician observes
a sequence of patients with a given symptom set s, then s/he chooses an appropriate drug, say d, for
them. The physician will learn a great deal about this drug d and will be unwilling to switch to another
drug d’ when s/he sees a patient with specific symptom set s’ (even if d’ would be more appropriate for
s’ if the physician had the same knowledge about drugs d and d’).
14

Diverse Concentration
More formally, consider a physician’s choice for a patient with symptoms s’ between two drugs
d’ and d. If the physician is myopic then his/her expected utility from using drugs d’ and d is given by
Bs’d’ ( 1 ‐ Var(θd’| hd’,p‐1) ‐ σε 2 ),

(7)

Bs’d ( 1 ‐ Var(θd| hd,p‐1) ‐ σε 2 ).

(8)

Therefore, the myopic physician is trading off the difference between Bs’d’ and Bs’d against the difference
between Var(θd’| hd’,p‐1) and Var(θd| hd,p‐1). If the maximum potential benefit from drug d’, Bs’d’, is
greater than that of drug d, Bs’d, but the physician prescribed drug d more often than drug d’ in the past
so that Var(θd| hd,p‐1)< Var(θd’| hd’,p‐1), then s/he may prefer to choose drug d. Note also that because
the complementary actions of a physician are not observed by other physicians, there is no spillover
learning. In particular, learning the market shares of the drugs that other physicians are prescribing is
no help in learning a drug’s ideal complementary actions.
As w is decreased (i.e., the volume of patients seen by the physician increases), the model
implies that physicians have a larger incentive to invest in learning how to use new or different drugs
effectively. Therefore we would expect to see more diverse prescribing with increases in patient
volume, ceteris paribus. The set of drugs a physician uses will still depend on the initial history of
symptoms of the patients the physician has seen, but this dependence will be weaker.
Finally, as w decreases to zero (i.e., the physician sees patients almost continuously), the set of
drugs that physicians will prescribe may be equal to the universe of drugs, D. More formally, if we
assume that there are sufficiently many different symptoms such that each drug d in D is optimal for
some symptoms s in S, d*(s)=d, then a very high‐volume physician will eventually learn a great deal
about optimal complementary actions θd for each drug d in D and prescribe d*(s) for every s.
Anticipating our empirical context, we note that physician specialties that are likely to see
particularly large numbers of patients with symptom set s can be expected to have greater incentives to
invest in learning about different drugs than those specialties rarely encountering such patients. To the
15

Diverse Concentration
extent the symptom set s presented to the physician is heterogeneous, given patient volume, so too will
be the range of drugs prescribed.
This framework implies that we would expect low‐volume physicians to concentrate more than
high‐volume physicians. In addition we would expect the treatment regimes among low‐volume
physicians to vary a great deal more than among high‐volume physicians, since the treatment decisions
of low‐volume physicians depend much more on their idiosyncratic random patient history than do
those of high‐volume physicians.
Similarly to differences in patient arrival rate, w, physicians with higher discount rates, r, would
be less likely to experiment with more drugs. Therefore, all else equal, we would expect physicians with
higher discount rates to have more concentrated prescribing. If one believes older physicians
approaching retirement discount the distant future more heavily than younger physicians, then
conditional on histories of their patients, we would expect older physicians nearing retirement to
experiment less and to concentrate more.
To illustrate these comparative‐static results (and the logic of the model more generally),
consider the following simple example. There are two drugs d1 and d2, and two symptoms s1 and s2.
Before seeing any patients, the physician has the same uncertainty about the ideal complementary
action for each drug, θd; that is, σd 2 = σ 2. Suppose, however, that the physician learns the ideal
complementary action precisely after a single prescription; that is, σε 2=0. To make the analysis
interesting we assume that di*(si)=si for i {1, 2} which is equivalent to B11>B12 and B22>B21. Note that we
do not assume that the benefits are symmetric, because asymmetries generate additional interesting
insights. Finally, we assume that symptoms s1 and s2 are equally likely.
First, suppose that the physician is myopic. Clearly, in the first period the physician prescribes
the best drug. There are three cases concerning what happens next:

16

Diverse Concentration
1. The physician always prescribes the drug that she prescribed in the first period. This
case is realized iff B12> B11 (1‐σ 2) and B21 > B22(1‐σ 2).
2. If the physician prescribed d1 in the first period, then she prescribes d1 thereafter. If
the physician prescribed d2 in the first period, then she prescribes the best drug
di*(si) thereafter. This case is realized iff B12 > B11 (1‐σ 2) and B21 < B22 (1‐σ 2).
3. The physician always prescribes the best drug di*(si). This case is realized iff B12 <
B11 (1‐σ 2) and B21 < B22 (1‐σ 2).
Second, suppose that the physician is not myopic. To make the analysis interesting, we assume
that Case 1 is realized if the physician is myopic: B12 > B11 (1‐σ 2) and B21 > B22 (1‐σ 2). Finally, for
definiteness we assume that the physician is more tempted to concentrate on d1 rather than d2, in the
sense that





B12  B11 1   2
B  B22 1   2
 21
B11  B12
B22  B21

.

This last assumption guarantees that the two critical values of δ satisfy δL < δH below. Depending on the
discount factor δ=e‐rw, we again have three cases:
1. The physician always prescribes the drug that she prescribed in the first period. This
case is realized if the physician is sufficiently impatient (or, equivalently, low‐
volume) that δ< δL.
2. If the physician prescribed d1 in the first period, then she prescribes d1 thereafter. If
the physician prescribed d2 in the first period, then she prescribes the best drug
di*(si) thereafter. This case is realized if the physician is moderately patient (or,
equivalently, moderate‐volume) such that δL< δ < δH.
3. The physician always prescribes the best drug di*(si). This case is realized if the
physician is sufficiently patient (or, equivalently, high‐volume) that δ >δH.

LIMITATIONS OF THE MODEL
Although this model has several clear predictions, it is limited in a number of ways. First, in this

model physicians fully know the basic “quality” Bsd of each drug, i.e., its maximum potential benefit; they
only do not know what complementary actions should be taken with each particular drug. In particular
this implies that physician knowledge of the national or local market share of each drug should not
affect the physician’s decisions. This is in contrast to simple models of “herding” behavior, for in our
framework differences in behavior persist even when prescribers observe nation‐wide market shares.21
Second, and related, the physician learns only from her/his own experience. A richer model
would incorporate learning over time from colleagues and market/scientific reports about drugs and
optimum complementary actions.
Third, in this model even if a physician’s payoffs are minimally related to patients’ payoffs, since
the physician’s objective is proportional to the patients’ payoffs (even if the proportional constant is
small), the physicians’ prescribing decisions are socially optimal. For example, if the physician’s payoff is
1% of a patient’s utility, then the physician’s prescription decisions are as if s/he incorporated the full
value of the decision. In other words, the problem does not change if one rescales Bsd. This observation
implies that the only role the social planner can play in this model if s/he has the same discounting as
the physician is to provide the physician with information from other physicians. A more realistic model
would include costs and benefits of learning about a drug from other sources.
We now describe the data utilized in our analysis, and then we will evaluate the extent to which
the predictions of this model are consistent with prescribing behavior observed in our data.

PRESCRIBING BEHAVIOR DATA
Our prescriber behavior data are taken from the IMS Xponent data source that tracks

prescribing behavior by linking individual retail and mail order dispensed pharmacy prescriptions to the
prescriber identification number. A 10% random sample of all prescribers who wrote at least one
antipsychotic prescription in 1996 was drawn, and these prescribers are followed on a monthly basis
from January 1996 through September 2008. Each year after 1996 the sample is refreshed by adding a
10% sample of new antipsychotic prescribers. These prescribers are “new” in the sense that they are
new to the sample; they may have been prescribing antipsychotics for many years.
We aggregate various specialties into five groups. Primary care physicians (“PCPs”) include
internal medicine, family medicine and practice, pediatrics, and general practice prescribers. Another
group of prescribers is psychiatrists (“PSY”), which not only includes general psychiatry but also child ‐
adolescent and geriatric psychiatry. The neurologist group (“NEU”) includes those in general neurology,
as well as geriatric and child neurologists. A fourth group of prescribers encompasses non‐physicians
(“NPs”), primarily nurse practitioners and physician assistants.22 Many states have licensed nurse
practitioners and certain physician assistants to write prescriptions, under varying physician supervision
provisions. In one survey of nurse practitioners, almost one‐third of patients they treated were seen for
mental health problems.23 We designate all other prescribers as other (“OTH”).
As seen in Table 2, although PCPs comprise about 50% of our sample of 19,737 prescribers, in
2007 they and the relatively populous OTH group of prescribers wrote relatively few antipsychotic and
atypical prescriptions, averaging less than six per month. In contrast, PSYs averaged more than 600
antipsychotic (550 atyical) prescriptions annually, several times the second leading prescribers – NPs,
with about 175 antipsychotic (155 atypical) prescriptions annually. NEU prescribers write on average
almost 100 antipsychotic prescriptions annually, about 80 of which are for atypicals.

In terms of concentration of prescribing behavior, while PSYs are the highest volume
prescribers, they treat with on average the largest distinct number of antipsychotics (7.46) and atypicals
(4.71), and exhibit the least concentrated antipsychotic (atypical) prescribing behavior, having on
average an HHI of 3,245 (3,661); in contrast, OTH physicians are the lowest annual volume prescribers,
use the smallest number of distinct antipsychotic (2.76) and atypical (1.65) molecules, and are the most
concentrated antipsychotic and atypical prescribers, having HHIs of 6,912 and 7,081, respectively. While
NPs are the second only to PSYs in terms of annual prescriber volume, in terms of both the variety of
drugs they use and their concentration, their behavior is quite similar to that of the relatively low
volume PCPs.
We link the prescriber identifiers in the IMS Xponent data base to the American Medical
Association (“AMA”) directory of physicians. Notably, while the AMA Masterfile Directory has
education, training, specialty certification and demographic data on most physicians and type of practice
20

Diverse Concentration
as of 2008, there is no comparable data available on NP nurse practitioners or physician assistants and
therefore for our subsequent empirical analyses we exclude all NPs.24
Several features of the physician data set are worth noting. First, we have data on only
physicians/NPs and their prescribing behavior, not on the patients they see. Second, IMS keeps track of
prescribers that are deceased or retire, using look‐back windows with no prescribing activity for one
year forward and one year backward. Third, because 1996 antipsychotic prescribers are followed
through September 2008 (unless they die or retire), as the sample time frame becomes more recent, the
set of prescribers in the sample is likely older than would be observed in an entirely new random sample
drawn in, say, 2007.25
VI.

EMPIRICAL FRAMEWORK
While the conventional HHI described earlier measures concentration, it cannot distinguish well

between different patterns of concentration. In a duopoly, for example, with firms A and B, one obtains
the same HHI if firm A has 80% market share and firm B has 20% as with the reverse situation in which A
has 20% market share and B has 80%. Our theoretical framework suggests we focus not only on
concentration, but also on the diversity of concentration. This suggests an alternative measure of
concentration that focuses on the deviation of concentration from national trends. Consider physician i
prescribing drug j in geographical region r, and denote the share of prescriptions written by this
physician for drug j as sijr. Let the overall market share of drug j in region r be mjr, where both sijr and mjr
are between zero and 100. As a measure of the deviance of physician i’s prescribing behavior from that
of the aggregate regional physicians’ market share, we calculate
Dijr = ∑j (sijr ‐ mjr)2 .

(9)

If every physician in region r had the same prescribing share, Dijr would equal zero. As physician
prescribing behavior heterogeneity (homogeneity) within region r increases, Dijr increases (decreases).26
21

Diverse Concentration
The regression specification we will take to the data is of the following general form:

C i  Agei  Volunei  X i   i

(10)

where X is a vector of covariates described below. As several of our measures of concentration will by
construction take on values only within a given interval (for example HHI will be between 0 and 10,000,
and is censored above 10,000), we take account of this in our analysis by employing appropriate
econometric estimation methods. In some regressions we specify interaction variables, particularly
among measures of volume and physician specialty.
Regarding covariates, the age of the prescribing physician is taken from the AMA Masterfile
Directory. In our empirical analysis we use age quartiles as indicator variable regressors instead of
merely the raw age of the physician. This allows us to evaluate whether young physicians or those near
retirement use technology in similar or different ways, perhaps nonlinear in age.
While we do not have any information about patients, several physician practice setting
variables will help us partially to control for the patient mix seen by a given physician. In particular, we
observe the specialty of the physician as well as whether the physician is hospital or office based, and
the county/region in which the practice is located.27 We expect, as Table 2 reports, that specialty is also
correlated with antipsychotic prescribing volume.
In terms of differential learning costs, we might expect the learning costs for physicians to vary
depending on their training and/or current practice environment. In particular in our analysis we will
control for whether the physician practices in a group or has a solo practice, the size of the county in
which the physician practices, and whether of the physician has an MD or DO degree.28
Finally we might expect women and men to use technology in somewhat different ways.
Therefore, in our analysis we control for the gender of the physician. In addition some physicians ask
that their prescribing data not be shared with pharmaceutical or other for‐profit organizations. We will
22

Diverse Concentration
examine whether these physicians appear to differ from other physicians in their concentration and
deviation prescribing behavior.

RESULTS

We begin our empirical analysis by examining which physicians use a wider variety of drug
molecules. We employ two measures of variety. The first measure is the number of distinct
antipsychotic drug molecules prescribed in 2007, while the second is the HHI of their prescriptions in
2007. We examine these both across all antipsychotic prescribing as well as just atypical prescribing.
A. Use of Diverse Technology: Number of Distinct Drug Molecules Prescribed29
We first estimate a Poisson specification relating the number of distinct antipsychotic drugs a
physician prescribes in 2007 to a host of explanatory variables and then using a similar specification we
estimate the number of different atypical drugs a physician prescribes during that year; the former
involves a maximum of 17 antipsychotics, and the latter six atypicals. As seen in Tables 4 and 5, the
estimates reveal that, holding other factors fixed, PSYs prescribe the largest number of distinct drugs
(for all antipsychotics, and only atypicals), followed by PCPs, NEUs, and OTH (the excluded group). In
addition, estimates on the physician‐specialty volume interaction variables indicate that while for all
specialties higher volume physicians employ a larger number of distinct molecules (both atypicals and
antipsychotics), volume matters most for physician specialists who are relatively low‐volume
prescribers, OTHs and PCPs. Across specialties, training and patient volume/experience appear to be
substitutes. In addition as they age, older physicians use more antipsychotics overall, however this
trend abates as physicians approach retirement age; we observe the oldest quartile of physicians using
only slightly more distinct antipsychotics than the youngest quartile (borderline statistical significance).
When examining physicians’ use of atypicals, however, we observe the only significant age coefficient is
that on the oldest quartile (59+), who prescribe fewer distinct atypicals. For physicians approaching
retirement, the difference in prescriber‐age effects for the overall antipsychotic versus atypical only
24

Diverse Concentration
suggests that the oldest physicians are disproportionate users of distinct older conventional
antipsychotics.

Physicians in larger counties use somewhat fewer distinct antipsychotic and atypical molecules,
however the size of the county seems to matter less when comparing counties with more than 500,000
residents. For all antipsychotics and for only atypicals, female prescribers use less variety relative to
male prescribers, but this effect is significant only for all antipsychotics. Prescribing variety is unrelated
to office practice type, whether hospital affiliated, and whether the physician restricts use of prescribing

molecules.

share of a physician’s antipsychotic prescriptions that are written for atypicals. Since the percent of

As seen in Table 6, other things equal, older physicians use a lower percentage of these newer
drugs than do those in the youngest quartile (under age 43), particularly the oldest quartile of
physicians, although the 2.00 percentage point magnitude effect is modest. By comparison, other things
equal, the atypical share is almost seven percentage points greater for female than male prescribers.
27

Diverse Concentration
Conditional on overall volume, PSY prescribers write the largest share of atypical prescriptions, followed
by NEU, PCPs, and finally OTH. However, as volume increases, high volume PCPs and high volume
physicians in specialties that do not typically prescribe antipsychotics (OTH) use a larger share of
atypicals, whereas high volume PSYs increasingly use older generation typical antipsychotics as their
prescription volume increases. Interestingly, the share of atypical prescriptions decreases with county
population size. Together these findings concerning greater use of older antipsychotics in more
populous areas, particularly by high volume prescribing PSYs, could reflect greater specialization by PSYs
in more urban areas, serving more heterogeneous patient populations.
In addition, we find that physicians who do not want their prescribing behavior information
used for pharmaceutical marketing prescribe a larger percentage of atypicals (but this effect is only
marginally significant), whereas hospital based physicians use a lower percentage of atypicals. Practice
type and form of medical degree are statistically insignificant factors.
C.

Physician Prescribing HHI
Next we examine the concentration of physician prescribing as measured by the HHI of the

physician’s prescriptions of all antipsychotics, and their HHI among the atypicals. Initial visual data
inspection suggested a log normal distribution of HHIs, censored from above at 10,000. We therefore
estimate Tobit models where the dependent variable is alternatively log of overall antipsychotic
physician HHI or log of atypical physician HHI. Both regressions generate a similar pattern of findings,
as is seen in Tables 7 and 8. In particular, consistent with the predictions from our theoretical model,
other things equal, higher volume physicians have less concentrated prescribing behavior. We also
observe that volume matters more for physicians that are either PCPs or those in OTH, again suggesting
that experience and medical specialty training are substitutes; in particular, the positive coefficient
estimate on the PSY‐volume interaction term almost entirely offsets the negative estimate on the
(implicit) OTH‐volume interaction variable. Moreover, while older physicians have less concentrated
28

Diverse Concentration
overall antipsychotic and insignificantly different atypical prescribing behavior compared to the
youngest physician quartile, the one exception is that the oldest quartile of physicians exhibit more
concentrated atypical prescribing, that is they utilize a smaller variety of atypicals than do all younger

physician quartiles. Restated in another way, the oldest physician quartile is no different from younger
quartiles in its concentrated use of antipsychotic drugs, but its prescribing of new generation atypical
drugs is more concentrated and less diverse. This could reflect greater familiarity with use of older first
generation antipsychotics from experiences earlier in their prescribing careers.
29

Diverse Concentration
Among specialties, holding volumes fixed, relative to OTH prescribers who have the most
concentrated overall antipsychotic prescribing behavior (the omitted group), PSY are least
concentrated, followed by PCPs, and NEUs; when confined to just the atypicals we observe a similar
pattern.

_____________________________________________________________________________________
In both regressions, concentration is greater, other things equal, as population increases.
However as in the earlier number of distinct molecules prescribed regressions, in all counties with

30

Diverse Concentration
greater than 500,000 population physicians seem to exhibit similar levels of concentration. Female
prescribers have more concentrated prescribing. Concentration is unaffected by practice size for overall
antipsychotic prescriptions, however solo practitioners have more concentrated atypical antipsychotic
use. DOs have less concentrated prescribing. Hospital‐based physicians are no different from other
physicians in their prescribing concentration behavior. Finally we observe that prescribers that place
restrictions on the use of prescribing data for pharmaceutical marketing purposes have less
concentrated prescribing; however this effect is only marginally significant.
D. Physician Deviant Prescribing Behavior
Finally we examine the deviation of any individual physician’s prescribing behavior from national
market shares, and from aggregate drug molecule shares in their HRR; we term this deviance from
national averages and from HRR averages, respectively. Recall that because of possibly varying initial
experience with an antipsychotic drug about which they attempted to learn more, our theoretical
framework predicts greater deviance for low‐volume prescribers, other things equal, as well as for
others whose present value of benefits from learning regarding variety is lower. Results from both
analyses are very similar and therefore we only report here the results that examine deviance from
national market shares.
Initial visual examination of the deviation data again suggested a log normal distribution, hence
we estimated a specification with log deviation as the dependent variable by least squares . Familiar
patterns of results emerged in this regression, as is seen in Table 9. In particular, higher volume
physician prescribing mimics national averages better than lower volume physician prescribing (i.e., low
volume prescribers deviate more from national market averages). This pattern is particularly true for
PCPs and for physicians coming from specialties classified as OTH, whose coefficient on the volume
interaction variables are significantly negative. However, in contrast for PSY and NEU specialties
deviation from national averages decreases less rapidly with volume ‐‐ the positive coefficient estimates
31

Diverse Concentration
on the volume interaction variable largely offset the negative estimate on the (implicit) OTH‐volume
interaction variable. Holding volume fixed, PSY prescribers deviate the least, followed by PCPs and
NEUs, each deviating less than OTH physicians (omitted group). Notably, the oldest quartile of
physicians and female physicians are more deviant than younger and male physicians, respectively.

Deviance from national market shares increases with the population of the county in which the

have similar prescribing patterns), but is unaffected by size of office practice, whether the physicians is
hospital based, and whether prescriber restricts release of prescribing data, and whether the physician
has a DO or MD degree.
Finally, we have undertaken a number of robustness checks, mostly involving the relationships
among concentration, specialty and volume. For example, to check whether our specialty‐volume
interaction term estimates in fact simply reflected a nonlinear, quadratic relationship in volume, we
added a quadratic volume term. In another model we added quadratic volume interacted with
specialty. In both cases, while some of the additional terms were statistically significant, the estimates
on the volume‐specialty terms were essentially unchanged. We also limited the sample just to the 3,463
psychiatrists. In that model, while the volume term had a significant negative coefficient estimate, it
was very small; estimates on some of the other variables were statistically significant, but qualitative
findings were essentially unchanged.
VII.

DISCUSSION
In the Introduction we noted that this research builds on the insights and empirical findings

reported by Frank and Zeckhauser [2007] regarding primary care physician “ready‐to‐wear” vs. “custom‐
made” treatment of patients. Our empirical analyses have both a wider range of physician specialty
prescribers yet also a more focused treatment choice – antipsychotic drugs as maintenance treatments
for schizophrenia and related chronic conditions. These findings largely complement and extend those
reported by Frank and Zeckhauser.
Our empirical findings on regional disparities differ in large part from those reported by the
Dartmouth Atlas project authors. As reported in Table 1, regional heterogeneity as measured by
coefficients of variation considered to be high (above 0.4) occur in our antipsychotic concentration
prescribing behavior only at the individual prescriber and county level of aggregation, but are low (less
than 0.2) at the HRR and greater levels of geographical aggregation. To examine regional disparities in
33

Diverse Concentration
greater detail, we have estimated regression equations with the prescriber’s total 2007 volume of
antipsychotic prescriptions (or its logarithm) as the dependent variable, and the set of non‐volume
explanatory variables specified in the tabled results as explanatory variables; we then estimate this
equation with and without HRR fixed effects added, and examine how much additional explanatory
power is provided by the HRR fixed effects. Although we find the 305 fixed effects are jointly highly
significant, their incremental contribution to goodness of fit is de minimus. Specifically, for the volume
levels regression, addition of 305 fixed effects increases the R2 from 0.2622 to 0.2747 (a 4.8%
proportional increase), while for the log volume specification the increase is from 0.3713 to 0.3855 (a
3.8% proportional increase). The variability in antipsychotic behavior that we observe is at the level of
the individual prescriber, and this prescriber behavior is remarkably similar across HRRs and states.
We note that other researchers have recently reported that regional disparities are in some
cases much less than the Medicare surgical and related procedures reported by the various Dartmouth
Atlas collaborators. For example, Rettenmeier and Saving [2009] report that rankings of states on the
basis of Medicare per enrollee health care spending differ substantially from those based on per capita
health care spending on the non‐Medicare/Medicaid population.
Zhang, Baicker and Newhouse [2010] examined annual 2007 inpatient, outpatient and
pharmaceutical spending for 533,170 beneficiaries simultaneously enrolled in Medicare Part A and B,
and in stand‐alone Part D Medicare plans. They find that across the 306 HRRs pharmaceutical spending
varies less than medical spending, and that pharmaceutical spending is only weakly positively correlated
(r = 0.10, P=0.07) with medical (non‐drug) spending, They interpret this weak correlation as being”
consistent with drugs’ being a substitute for medical care for some patients and a complement to
medical care for others.”30 Alternatively, HRRs with high medical spending do not have offsetting lower
pharmaceutical spending – they are not at all associated.

34

Diverse Concentration
One recent article receiving much public attention highlighting the large geographic variations in
Medicare medical care spending was that by Atul Gawande [2009], who compared Medicare spending in
two nearby Texas cities, McAllen and El Paso, and found a nearly two‐fold difference in per capita
Medicare spending. Gawande attributed this discrepancy to a change in McAllen during the mid‐1990s
when health care providers apparently adopted a greater “entrepreneurial spirit” and a “culture of
money”. In response, since the same providers generally care for both Medicare and privately insured
patients, Franzini, Mikhail and Skinner [2010] inquired whether, in the same two cities, similar patterns
of care are observed for people under age 65. With several exceptions, Franzini et al. found that
spending per capita for medical services by privately insured populations in McAllen and El Paso was
much less divergent. For example, while spending per Medicare enrollee per year was 86% higher in
McAllen than in El Paso, total spending per member per year was 7% lower in El Paso for the population
insured by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas. After examining and ruling out several other
possibilities, Franzini et al. concluded that “health care providers respond quite differently to incentives
in Medicare compared to those in private insurance plans.”31,32
Our theoretical framework builds on a Bayesian learning model, in which a physician can only
learn how to use a given drug effectively by prescribing that particular drug to patients, i.e., there is no
possible learning about other drugs that the physician has not prescribed. While this framework can
help explain persistent physician concentration prescribing behavior as the rational outcome based on
learning from own prescribing behavior, and thereby be consistent with the Frank and Zeckhauser
“sensible use of norms” behavior, our theoretical framework entirely ignores learning from others,
spillovers, and herding behavior. Chandra and Staiger [2007] have developed and estimated a model
that focuses on productivity spillovers related to local specialization in heart attack care, whereby
excellence in one clinical approach in a local market raises the average skill of other practitioners of that
approach operating in the same market. This in turn leads to greater specialization and reduces both
35

Diverse Concentration
the absolute and relative productivity of practitioners using alternative approaches. Homogeneity in
clinical approach within a geographic area, and substantial heterogeneity across areas, can reflect what
may also be sensible and useful since they stem from positive spillover effects from local specialization.
In future research, it would be useful to attempt to incorporate various types of spillover effects into
physician prescribing behavior. This is particularly important, since learning from sources other than
one own’s prescribing behavior is a critical component in efforts to enhance the practice of evidence‐
based medicine.
VIII.

SUMMARY AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
Our empirical analysis has revealed that several key patterns of findings. First, we observe that

higher volume physician do in fact use a wider variety of drugs. This is true when we examine
physicians’ use of antipsychotics overall and when we focus only on their use of atypical antipsychotics.
In addition we find that volume matters most for those physicians that are PCPs or that are trained in
specialties that do not typically prescribe antipsychotics in large volumes, the OTH prescribers. In some
analyses volume matters also for PSYs but in all regressions it matters less for PSY physicians than for
other prescribers. We interpret this as medical specialty training experience and experience gained
from high volume prescribing as being substitute sources of prescribing knowledge.33
We also observe that physicians in the middle of their career (those from 42‐58) prescribe the
widest variety of antipsychotic drugs whereas the oldest quartile of physicians tends to prescribe fewer
of the newest drugs (atypicals); moreover, their prescribing patterns deviate more from national and
HRR averages.
Somewhat surprisingly physicians practicing in smaller counties and those that have a DO
instead of an MD degree prescribe a wider variety of antipsychotic and atypical molecules, have less
concentrated prescribing behavior and deviate less from national averages.

36

Diverse Concentration
The predictions from the theoretical model outlined in the earlier part of this manuscript help
illuminate reasons why we observe these patterns of prescribing behavior. In particular, in a world
where physicians are balancing the benefits of learning how to use a new drug with the costs of learning
about these drugs, high volume physicians would tend to realize a greater return from exploration than
would low volume prescribers. In addition, we would expect physicians closer to retirement to also
have less of an incentive to prescribe a wide variety of drugs, since their future patient volume
benefiting from this knowledge is smaller, other things equal.
Finally, we observe that PSYs use the widest variety of drugs and that volume is not a strong
predictor of their prescribing behavior. If these physicians in their specialty training learned how to treat
patients with schizophrenia using these drugs more effectively, then we may expect these physicians to
become adept at prescribing these drugs earlier in their careers. Therefore their costs of learning would
be lower and this would help explain why even low volume psychiatrists prescribe a wide variety of
antipsychotics and atypicals. Another interpretation of this finding is that psychiatrists see a wider range
of patients and therefore these physicians’ patients benefit more from being prescribed the drug that is
best suited to their particular symptoms, even if the physician is not adept at managing the side effects
that result from the prescribed drug. We cannot differentiate between these two explanations without
having data on patients.
A major limitation of this study is that we do not observe data on the patient populations
treated by physicians. However, we note the literature cited and results obtained by Frank and
Zeckhauser [2007] suggest that other than through demographics, variations in patient condition
severity and clinical manifestations are remarkably unrelated to physician practice behavior, and that
results obtained by them are largely quantitatively unaffected with alternative specifications
incorporating patient‐specific data. The dominant role of physicians over patients in influencing choice
of medication has also been reported elsewhere both by other health economists (e.g., Hellerstein
37

Diverse Concentration
[1997] and Zhang, Baicker and Newhouse [2010]) and by academic clinicians (e.g., Schneeweis, Glynn,
Avorn and Solomon [2005]).
Several interesting future research projects have emerged from our study. As noted earlier, the
relative efficacy, tolerability and cost‐effectiveness of the various typical and atypical antipsychotics
remains a controversial issue, even after publication of a substantial number of articles over the last
decade, including those based on randomized clinical trials.34 What is less controversial is that this
controversy has had a substantial impact on changing prescription shares of the various antipsychotics.
Our IMS Health data reveal that between 2002 and 2008, the Seroquel prescription share increased
from 21% to 37%, Abilify from 0% to 16%, Geodon from 4% to 7%, even as the Risperdal share declined
from 35% to 26%, and that of Zyprexa from 34% to 12%. Who were the prescribers who switched most
rapidly – low or high volume, what specialties, gender, age group – and who were those who changed
relatively little? What were the relative responses to the FDA issuing bold boxed warnings, to
professional associations revising treatment guidelines, to publication of major findings in medical
journals? Understanding which prescribers, and their characteristics, respond most and which the least
would provide valuable information to guide future information dissemination strategies.35
Our findings suggest that a significant proportion of the heterogeneity in the treatments
patients receive depends upon physician preferences in treatment regime. It would be informative and
useful to identify specific patterns in physician decision‐making that appear to indicate general
differences in “style” across physician practices, analogous to recent investigations characterizing
management style.36

Additional controversy emerged when major studies, published in 2005 and 2006, raised issues
regarding whether there were any significant efficacy and tolerability differences between the costly
SGAs and the older off‐patent conventional antipsychotics, as well as differences among the five SGAs.
Important issues regarding the statistical power of these studies to detect differences, were they
present, have also been raised, and currently whether there are any significant differences among and
between the conventional and SGA antipsychotics remains controversial and unresolved. For further
details and references, see the Appendix available from the lead author, “Timelines – U.S. Food and
Drug Administration Approvals and Indications, and Significant Events Concerning Antipsychotic Drugs”.
12
Although at times we will use the words “prescribed”, “written” and “dispensed” interchangeably, the
IMS Health Xponent data are based on dispensed prescriptions; for a variety of reasons, a physician can
prescribe a Product X but it may not be dispensed at all, or in fact after consulting with the prescriber
the pharmacist may dispense product Y.
13
The 75% cutoff is a stringent one, for the patient population seen by a prescriber is likely somewhat
heterogeneous, with some patients having failed to respond to various medicines (perhaps including the
physician’s favorite one), and others having a history of effective response to another drug. For the
latter, a physician may be reluctant to switch from an effective drug to the physician’s favorite one,
given the medical profession’s adage “Don’t shoot a singing bird”.

The U.S. Department of Justice horizontal merger guidelines state that when a merger results in a
change in the HHI of more than 100 points and with the merged firm generating a post‐merger industry
HHI of > 1800, the merger will be presumed to create or enhance market power or facilitate its exercise,
and will likely be very closely scrutinized by the Department of Justice, and perhaps even challenged.
The merger guidelines can be accessed online at
http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/guidelines/horiz_book/15.html.
17
For example, if a prescriber only used three of the atypicals with prescription shares of 65%, 25% and
10%, the HHI would be 4950; if however, all six were used equally (each 16.67%), the HHI would be
1667.33.,
18
This framework is summarized in Gibbons and Henderson [2011].

An early discussion of these principal‐agent issues is found in Pauly [1980], albeit in the context of
hospital treatments, not pharmaceuticals.

See Banerjee [1992] and Bikhchandani, Hirschleifer and Welch [1992].
In preliminary data analyses examining relative antipsychotic prescribing by specialty, nurse
practitioners were the fourth largest specialty, comprising 20,872 of the 224,259 (9.3%) prescribers in
the top eleven specialties.
23
For further details, see, for example, Cipher and Hooker [2006]; also see Hooker and Cipher [2005],
Morgan and Hooker [2010], Pohl, Hanson, Newland and Cronenwett [2010] and Shell [2001].
24
In addition to excluding the 1,641 non‐physician prescribers, we dropped 237 observations for which
county codes were missing, seven with missing gender information, and three observations for which
age information was an unreasonable outlier. This left us with a total of 17,652 observations.
25
In a Physician Sample appendix, available from the lead author, we discuss this later point in more
detail.
26
Alternative measures of concentration that account explicitly for inherently “noisy” concentration
from low volume prescribers have been developed by Ellison and Glaeser [1997] in the context of the
geographic concentration of manufacturing industries, and adapted to the context of prescription
pharmaceuticals by Stern and Trajtenberg [1998]. Our deviance measure is closely related to the Ellison‐
Glaeser concept.
27
For 214 of the physicians information about the size of the county in which they practice is not
available, and they are therefore excluded in our later analyses. This reduces our final sample size to
17,652 physicians.
28
DO is doctor of osteopathy. Mosby’s Medical Dictionary [1998, p. 1169] defines osteopathy as “a
therapeutic approach to the practice of medicine that uses all the usual forms of medical diagnosis and
therapy, including drugs, surgery, and radiation, but that places greater emphasis on the influence of the
relationship between the organs and the musculoskeletal system than traditional medicine does.
Osteopathic physicians recognize and correct structural problems using manipulation.”
29
We remind the reader that we are using the word “prescribed” somewhat loosely, for in fact the
Xponent data only track the number of prescriptions dispensed via retail and mail order. The number of
prescriptions written may deviate from the number actually dispensed for various reasons, which we do
not examine here.

32
Related findings have been reported by Philipson, Lockwood, Goldman et al. [2010], who find that
variation in utilization in the public sector is about 2.8 times as great for outpatient visits (P < 0.01) and
3.9 times as great for hospital days (P = 0.09) as in the private sector. However, in part because of
government monopsony power, variation in spending appears to be greater in the private sector,
consistent with the importance of public sector price restraints.
33
In a related finding, Doyle, Ewer and Wagner [2008] find that while treating randomized patients at
the same hospital, medical residents from a lower‐ranked medical school were able to substitute
diagnostic tests and specialist consultation for the more rapid judgments made by residents from a
higher‐ranked medical school, achieving the same outcomes on average but at a higher cost.
34
An appendix to this paper available from the lead author, “Timelines Appendix” provides further
details. Among the more notable publications are those based on the CATIE study; see, for example,
