ABSTRACT
Using U.S county level data on lead in air for 1978-1988, this paper provides the first causal evidence
on the effects of airborne lead exposure on the general fertility rate and the completed fertility rate
in the broad population. Instrumental variable estimates show the increase in completed fertility implied
by the average observed decrease in airborne lead is 0.14 children per woman, which is 6.4 percent
of mean fertility. To explore the current relevance of our findings, we estimate the effect of lead historically
accumulated in topsoil on fertility in the 2000s. The results suggest that lead may continue to impair
fertility today, both in the United States and in other countries that have significant amounts of lead
in topsoil.

1. Introduction
Fertility is important both at the individual level and at the societal level, where it has
implications for economic activity. Thus, factors that adversely affect fertility are of significant
policy concern. Animal studies and epidemiological research on small samples of workers selfselected into high occupational exposure have shown that lead can adversely affect both male
and female reproductive systems. The causal effects of lead on fertility in the broader population,
where exposure levels are lower, and the magnitude of those effects are open questions.
Using U.S. county level data on airborne lead for 1978-1988, this paper provides the first
causal evidence on the effects of lead exposure on the general fertility rate and the completed
fertility rate in the broad population. Lead exposure declined over this period as a result of the
phase down of lead in gasoline and broader efforts to reduce air pollution. The phase down of
lead in gasoline had two major EPA regulatory deadlines during this period. Beginning October
1979, refineries were required to produce a quarterly average of no more than 0.8 grams per
gallon for all gasoline. In July 1985 the standard was reduced to 0.5 grams per gallon of leaded
gasoline. A third EPA deadline was also relevant for lead. Counties out of compliance with TSP
standards under the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments were required to come into compliance by
January 1983. Lead was a component of TSP and so fell as a result of efforts to reduce TSP.
To examine the impact of exposure to lead on fertility rates, we use U.S. Vital Statistics
data on fertility, data on children ever born from the 1980 and 1990 Censuses of Population, and
EPA monitor data on airborne lead. The U.S. National Vital Statistics data are monthly countylevel data derived from individual birth and mortality records. The census data are decennial, but
ask women about the number of children ever born. Readings of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency’s network of airborne lead monitoring stations across the nation over the
period 1978-1988 were obtained via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The airborne
lead sample covers around 40 percent of the U.S. population.
To address endogenous sorting related to household preferences for air quality and
avoidance behavior, and measurement error associated with the potential disconnection between
pollution readings from the EPA monitors and the actual pollution exposure faced by individuals,
we use instrumental variables (IV). 1 The first stage of the IV takes a difference-in-differences

approach. The comparison is before and after implementation of the October 1979 and July 1985
deadlines regarding the phase down of lead in gasoline, in counties with and without interstates
in the 1944 interstate highway plan. We use the 1944 highway plan rather than counties with and
without actual interstate highways, because the highway plan was designed primarily for military
purposes rather than potential economic outcomes (Baum-Snow 2007, Michaels 2008). The
siting of the actual highways may be influenced by local political forces (Carter 2018),
potentially reflecting household preferences for air quality. In addition, local investments in
transportation infrastructure may signal a willingness to invest in other infrastructure projects
such as hospital and other health care facilities, which would affect fertility and health outcomes
more broadly. Because lead is a component of particulate matter, the first stage also includes the
differences between counties in and out of attainment with TSP under the 1977 Clean Air Act
Amendments before and after the January 1983 deadline for compliance. Although previous
work has documented correlations between other pollutants and fertility (Carré et al. 2017, Casey
et al. 2018), when we decompose TSP into lead and non-lead chemicals, airborne lead appears to
be driving our results.
The IV estimates show that increased lead exposure lowers not only short-run fertility as
measured by the general fertility rate, but also completed fertility as measured by children ever
born. For airborne lead in 1978-1988, the increase in the general fertility rate for women ages 1544 years implied by the average observed decrease in airborne lead is 4.5 births per 1,000 women
per year, which is 6.7 percent of mean fertility. Using the 1980 and 1990 census data on children
ever born, IV estimates also show the increase in completed fertility implied by the average
observed decrease in airborne lead is 0.14 children per woman, which is 6.4 percent of mean
fertility. The surprisingly similar percent changes in the general fertility rate and completed
fertility suggest that the short-run effects might not be offset by a reversion-to-the-mean behavior
in later years of the reproductive cycle.
To explore the current relevance of our findings for 1978-1988, we estimate the effect of
lead in topsoil on fertility in the 2000s. Exposure to lead in topsoil occurs through occurs through
inhalation, when soil is resuspended, and consumption, when food or drink comes in contact
with dust or if food is grown in the soil. As part of larger soil sampling projects, the U.S.
Geological Survey collected data on lead in topsoil in the 2000s. The soil lead sample covers
about 70 percent of the U.S. population. The fertility analysis uses Vital Statistics data and data

3

from the Current Population Survey on children ever born. Differently from our main empirical
strategy, the instrumental variable approach in this case uses a cross sectional intent-to-treat
approach leveraging variation in topsoil lead arising from the 1944 interstate highway plan. In
counties with a highway recommended by the plan, lead was potentially accumulated in the soil
in a manner plausibly unrelated to local preferences for environmental quality. Estimates suggest
that counties with lead concentration above the median have general fertility rates that are 7.8
births per 1,000 women per year lower than counties below the median, which is 11 percent of
mean fertility. 2 The last finding is particularly concerning, because it suggests that lead may
continue to impair fertility today, both in the United States and in other countries that have
significant amounts of lead in topsoil.
To put these findings in perspective, we compare the magnitude of the effects of lead on
the general fertility rate to the impact of the introduction of the contraceptive pill in the U.S. in
1957. Bailey (2010, 2013) provides quasi-experimental evidence that the availability of the birth
control pill decreased annual general fertility rates by approximately 7 births per 1,000 women of
childbearing age (15 to 44 years) in the late 1950s and early 1960s. 3 With the caveat that
contraceptives are used voluntarily, and lead exposure is almost surely involuntary, the fertility
effects of airborne lead in 1978-1988 and lead in soil in the 2000s are similar in magnitude to the
impact of the pill.
It is also useful to consider the private and social costs of lead exposure. As a result of the
decline in airborne lead between 1978 and 1988, our estimates suggest that 95,000 additional
babies would be born annually. Based on USDA estimates of the costs of raising a child from
birth to age 18 and assuming parents obtain utility from having children, those additional
children imply private utility gains of at least $18.3 billion (2013 USD). How these private utility
gains translate into social benefits from the births of additional children is an open question.
Whatever the social benefits of fertility, it is worth noting that reductions in lead have large
social benefits, because of the adverse lead effects on infant and child development. If the
2

In the robustness checks, we provide evidence that the fertility effects of topsoil lead are not sensitive to including
and instrumenting other two variables potentially affected by transportation infrastructure and plausibly related to
fertility: average commuting time, and access to health care.

3

Bailey (2012, 2013) also examines the impact of the federal family planning programs starting in 1964, and finds
causal evidence that annual general fertility rates declined by 1.5 births per 1,000 women of childbearing age after
those programs reached their full capacity in the late 1960s.

4

fertility benefits were counted as social benefits, the phase down of lead in gasoline would pass a
cost-benefit analysis based on these benefits alone.
This study contributes to two literatures. The first is the literature on the causes of
infertility generally, and on the effect of lead on fertility in particular. There is a large literature
studying determinants of fertility (Schmidt 2005, 2007, Bitler and Schmidt 2006, 2012, Bailey
2010, 2012, Bailey et al. 2014), and our findings provide causal estimates of an understudied
cause – exposure to lead. Our paper is related to Grossman and Slusky (2017), which studied the
effect of an increase in lead in the water system of Flint, Michigan on the general fertility rate.
The results of their case study are qualitatively similar to our nationwide findings on the general
fertility rate, even though the source of exposure is intrinsically different. Their difference-indifferences estimated effect of the change in the water supply in Flint on the annual general
fertility rate was approximately 7.5 live births per 1,000 women ages 15-49, or a 12 percent
decrease. Our paper is the only paper we are aware of to examine the effects of lead on
completed fertility.
Second, this study adds to a growing body of work investigating the impacts of pollution
on economic outcomes. Our findings contribute to the subliteratures on air pollution (Chay and
Greenstone 2003, 2005, Currie and Neidell 2005, Currie and Walker 2011, Currie et al. 2014,
Currie et al. 2015, Schlenker and Walker 2016, and Deschenes et al. 2017), and on lead
(Troesken 2006, Reyes 2007, 2015, Clay, Troesken, and Haines 2014, Aizer and Currie 2017,
Sauve-Syed 2017, Aizer et al. 2018, Gronqvist et al. 2018, and Billings and Schnepel, 2018). It
also contributes to a much smaller literature investigating the impact of soil pollution, including
Superfund sites, on economic outcomes (Greenstone and Gallagher 2008, Currie, Greenstone and
Moretti 2011, Gamper-Rabindran and Timmins 2013, Rau, Urzúa and Reyes 2015, and Persico
et al. 2016).
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a background
discussion on types of lead exposure, and its relationship with fertility. Section 3 describes the
data and some summary statistics. Section 4 lays out the empirical strategy, focusing particularly
on our instrumental variable approach. Section 5 reports and discusses the main findings and
robustness checks for the effects of airborne lead on fertility. Section 6 explores the current
relevance of our main findings by estimating the effects of exposure to lead accumulated in
topsoil on fertility. Section 7 presents some back of the envelope calculations on the benefits and

5

costs of reducing lead exposure based on the main results. Lastly, Section 8 offers some
concluding remarks.

2. Background

To understand the relationship between lead exposure and fertility, we start by describing
how lead enters the human body, the vectors of exposure, and finally the mechanisms through
which fertility is affected. Because the major source of exposure in the 1970s and 1980s was
vehicle emissions due to leaded gasoline, at the end of this section we discuss the policies
phasing down lead in gasoline in the United States. Those policy changes will be at the center of
our empirical analysis later on, when we uncover the causal effects of airborne lead on fertility.

Lead in the Human Body
Lead primarily enters the body from breathing in dust or chemicals that contain lead or
by ingesting food or liquids that contain lead. 4 Once lead reaches the lungs, it goes quickly to
other parts of the body via the bloodstream. Once lead reaches the stomach, some is absorbed
into the bloodstream and the remainder is excreted. 5 Once in the blood, lead travels to the “soft
tissues” and organs such as the liver, kidneys, lungs, brain, spleen, muscles, and heart. After
several weeks, most of the lead moves into the bones and teeth. The half-life of lead in blood is
approximately 30 days. 6 Once it is taken in and distributed to organs, the lead that is not stored in
bones leaves the body via urine or feces. The primary method for determining lead exposure is
measurement of blood lead levels.
Although public discussion has focused on the effects of lead in children, adults are also
adversely affected by lead. The focus on young children has been driven by the effects of lead on
neurological development, which has implications for IQ, educational outcomes, and behavioral

Lead can enter via skin through some compounds, but this is relatively uncommon in non-occupational settings.
Lead can also enter the body if one is shot with lead pellets, but this is relatively uncommon vector of exposure.

Experiments using adult volunteers showed that, for adults who had just eaten, the amount of lead that got into the
blood from the stomach was only about 6 percent of the total amount taken in. On the other hand, children absorb
about 50 percent of ingested lead (U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services 2007).

outcomes. 7 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC 2017], “The
National Toxicology Program [NTP 2012], and the American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP
2016] have concluded that there is sufficient evidence for adverse health effects in children and
adults at blood lead levels (BLLs) <5 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL).” 8 Adults can experience
a variety of adverse health effects including decreased renal function, high blood pressure, and
hypertension. We will discuss fertility further below.

Vectors of Exposure
Lead exposure occurs through a number of channels including air, water, food, paint, and
soil. Airborne emissions are driven by industrial activities, coal-fired power plants, and on-road
vehicles and small aircraft. Figure 1 from the EPA provides information for 1970-2011 on
airborne lead emissions by source. 9 Emissions from on-road vehicles were by far the largest
source of lead emissions through 1996, but reached zero in 2002. We discuss the regulation of
lead in gasoline later in this section. Lead has not yet been banned in aviation gas (non-road
engines) used for small aircraft. In 2011 it was the largest source of airborne lead emissions.
Lead service pipes, lead in food, and lead paint have played different roles in different
time periods. Lead service pipes were a major source of exposure in the early twentieth century.
The treatment of water to manage pH and the use of other types of pipes reduced water lead
levels. To further address remaining issues, lead was banned in plumbing fixtures in 1986. Lead
in food most often came from cans or solder. U.S. manufactures stopped using lead solder in
1991 and FDA banned the use of lead solder in imported canned goods in 1995. Lead in paint
has received considerable attention, particularly in older housing stock. The manufacture of lead
paint was banned in 1978.

7

For a detailed review of the literature on these outcomes, see National Toxicology Program (2012).

The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Lead Standards require workers to be removed
from lead exposure when BLLs are equal or greater than 50 µg/dL (construction industry) or 60 µg/dL (general
industry) and allow workers to return to work when the BLL is below 40 µg/dL. The number of workers with blood
lead levels in this range is very small. Drawing on data from 41 states that participate in the Adult Blood Lead
Epidemiology and Surveillance (ABLES) Program, the CDC reports that 11,536 individuals had levels above 40
µg/dL between 2002 and 2011. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6247a6.htm

Lead in soil reflects both naturally occurring lead deposits and deposition from a variety
of anthropogenic sources including lead smelting, industrial activity, agricultural activity,
electricity generation, lead in paint, and gasoline emissions. As we noted in the introduction, lead
in soil is a recognized issue, but little has been done to address it. Lead in soil is resuspended in a
number of contexts including during dry or windy periods, during construction, and when it is
tracked into houses and takes the form of dust.

Lead Exposure and Fertility
The National Toxicology Program published an exhaustive analysis of existing
epidemiological studies on the health effects of low level lead, including studies of the effect of
lead on reproduction (NTP 2012). 10 In this section, we summarize some of their key findings.
One important point, which the NTP (2012, p. 89) explicitly notes, is: “Because the database of
human studies on most reproductive endpoints is limited to occupational exposure studies, many
of the available studies are for blood Pb levels >10 μg/dL.” For comparison, it is useful to
provide evidence on blood lead levels in adults during our sample period. The first nationally
representative sample of blood lead levels took place as part of the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) II, which occurred during 1976-1980. Additional data were
collected during NHANES III (1988-1991), and NHANES 1999-2002. In 1976-1980 the
geometric mean blood lead level for adults ages 20-74 was 13.1 μg/dL (Pirkle et al. 1994). In
1988-1994 and 1999-2002, the age-standardized geometric mean blood lead levels were 2.76
μg/dL and 1.64 μg/dL (Muntner et al. 2005). In comparison, in the preindustrial period, the
natural blood lead level is estimated to have been 0.016 μg/dL (Flegal and Smith 1992).
Lead is associated with delays in puberty. The primary channels through which this
10
The conclusions reported in this NTP Monograph were based on a review of the primary epidemiological
literature, scientific input from technical advisors that reviewed pre-public release drafts of each chapter
summarizing the evidence for specific health effects associated with low-level Pb, public comments received during
the course of the evaluation, and comments from an expert panel of ad hoc reviewers during a public meeting to
review the Draft NTP Monograph on November 17-18, 2011. The selection of panel members and conduct of the
peer review were performed in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act and Federal policies and
regulations. The panel members served as independent scientists, not as representatives of any institution, company,
or governmental agency. Panel members had two major responsibilities in reviewing the draft NTP Monograph: (1)
to determine whether the scientific information cited in the draft monograph is technically correct, clearly stated,
and objectively presented and (2) to determine whether the scientific evidence presented in the draft monograph
supports the NTP’s conclusions regarding health effects of low-level lead (Pb). Given such a meticulous scientific
review, we refer to the monograph for a comprehensive list of references. In any case, Hauser and Sokol (2008) and
Mendola, Messer, and Rappazzo (2008) also provide reviews of the science linking environmental contaminant
exposures with fertility and reproductive health impacts in adult males and adult females, respectively.

occurs appear to be delays in growth and altered hormone concentrations. The NTP (2012, p. 89)
concludes: “In children, there is sufficient evidence that blood Pb levels <10 μg/dL are
associated with delayed puberty in both boys and girls. Nine studies with mean blood Pb levels
<10 μg/dL support the relationship between Pb and delayed puberty.” At lead levels below 5
μg/dL the evidence is more mixed, with some studies finding effects and other studies finding no
effects.
Lead is associated with reproductive effects in men including fertility. The male
reproductive system has been shown to be affected by occupational lead exposure (Joffe et al.
2003, Hamilton and Hardy 1983, Lin 1996, Lin et al. 1998, Sallmén 2001, Sallmén, Lindbhm,
and Nirumnem 2000, Shiau, Wang, and Chen 2004, Vigeh, Smith, and Hsu 2011, Winder 1993).
Possible channels include direct effects on testes and indirect effects through hormones. Several
studies document the negative relationship between lead exposure and sperm count and density
(Alexander et al. 1996, Apostoli, Porru, and Bisanti 1999, Apostoli et al. 2000, Assennato et al.
1987, Paul 1860, Wu et al. 2012). The NTP (2012, p. 90) finds: “There is sufficient evidence that
paternal blood Pb levels ≥20 μg/dL are associated with delayed conception time and limited
evidence that blood Pb levels ≥10 μg/dL in men are associated with other measures of reduced
fertility.”
Fertility of women is more difficult to measure, and they have lower occupational
exposure to lead, so there is less evidence on lead and fertility for women. NTP (2012, p. 105)
states: “There are not enough studies of fertility with Pb exposure data for women in the general
population or even with occupational exposure to evaluate the potential relationship between Pb
exposure and fertility in women.” Studies of couples who are at IVF or fertility clinics suggest
that blood lead may be associated with infertility. As the NTP (2012, p.106) notes, however,
“Results from studies of men or women reporting to IVF or infertility clinics should be
interpreted with caution because they may represent a sensitive subpopulation.”
Lead is associated with spontaneous abortions (Hertz-Picciotto 2003, Vigeh 2010) and
has adverse health effects during pregnancy (Amaral et al. 2010, Bellinger 2005, Cleveland et al.
2008, Hu et al. 2006, Rudge et al. 2009, Schell et al. 2003, Taylor, Golding, and Emond 2015,
Zhu et al. 2010). The channel appears to be the adverse effect of lead on the development of the
fetus’s neurological system. The NTP (2012, p. 108) states: “There are few human studies with
blood Pb data that evaluate the potential association with spontaneous abortion. The conclusions

9

that there is limited evidence that maternal blood Pb <10 μg/dL and paternal blood Pb >31 μg/dL
are associated with spontaneous abortion are based primarily on two key studies: the BorjaAburto et al. (1999) prospective nested case-control study and Lindbohm et al. (1991a)
retrospective nested case control study. Additional support for the association is provided by
several studies that determine exposure by occupation or residence rather than by blood Pb data.”
One question that these studies do not address is the extent to which the fertility will
increase with declines in lead exposure. Animal studies suggest that the adverse effects of lead
on males and females may be reversible. Sokol (1989) provides evidence that serum testosterone
and sperm parameters normalized at the end of the recovery period (30 days after discontinuing
treatment) in prepubertal animals but not in pubertal animals. Piasek and Kostial (1991) show
the effects of lead exposure on reproductive outcomes in female rats were reversible. A few
small studies of occupationally exposed male workers provide additional evidence that effects of
lead on reproductive outcomes may be reversible (Viskum et al. 1999, Fisher-Fischbein et al.
1987, and Cullen et al. 1984).
Although the previous discussion focused on the effects of blood lead levels on
outcomes, in most settings – including the setting we study – only data on airborne lead is
available. What is the relationship between air lead levels and blood lead levels? EPA (1986)
presented four studies of the blood-air lead relationship for adult males. One of the studies was
population based, in which the individuals had personal air monitors, and the other three studies
were experimental. The EPA analysis concludes (p.1-98): “Thus, a reasonably consistent picture
emerges in which the blood lead-air lead relationship for direct inhalation is approximately linear
in the range of normal ambient exposures (0.1-2.0 μg/m3).” The slopes ranged from 1.25-2.14.
That is, a 1μg/m3 increase in air lead was associated with a 1.25-2.14 μg/dL increase in blood
lead. For observational studies, the EPA finds (p. 1-101) that: “Slopes which include both direct
(inhalation) and indirect (via soil, dust, etc.) air lead contributions are necessarily higher than
those estimates for inhaled air lead alone. Studies using aggregate analyses (direct and indirect
air impacts) typically yield slope values in the range of 3-5, about double the slope due to inhaled
air lead alone.”

10

Regulation of Lead in Gasoline
As mentioned previously, emissions from on-road vehicles were the largest source of
lead emissions through 1996, but reached zero in 2002. This remarkable decline in lead was
driven by the introduction of catalytic converters and the phase down of lead in gasoline.
Catalytic converters, which became mandatory in model year 1975, were designed to control
tailpipe emissions including hydrocarbons, nitrous oxides, and carbon monoxide.

Leaded

gasoline destroys the ability of catalytic converters to control emissions. 11
EPA also scheduled performance standards requiring refineries to decrease the average
lead content of all gasoline – leaded and unleaded pooled. Initially slated to begin in 1975, the
lead standards were postponed until October 1979. Once established, refineries were required to
produce a quarterly average of no more than 0.8 grams per gallon (gpg). The regulation set an
average lead concentration among total gasoline output to deliberately provide refineries with
the incentive to increase unleaded production. By the early 1980s gasoline lead levels had
declined by about 80 percent.
At that point, EPA decided to review and tighten the standards. Lead limits were
recalculated as an average of lead in leaded gas only, as unleaded fuel was by then a wellestablished product. The new rules specifically limited the allowable content of lead in leaded
gasoline to a quarterly average of 1.1 grams per leaded gallon (gplg). From 1983 to 1985 the
EPA conducted an extensive cost-benefit analysis of a dramatic reduction in the lead standard to
0.1 gplg by 1988. As a result, in July 1985 the standard was reduced to 0.5 gplg. In light of new
evidence on the role of lead in gasoline on mental retardation and elevated blood pressure,
beginning in 1986 the allowable content of lead in leaded gasoline was reduced to 0.1 gplg. Lead
was eventually banned as a fuel additive in the U.S. beginning in 1996.

3. Data

Airborne Lead
Our airborne lead data are from EPA air pollution monitors located across the country.
The data were obtained by a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The monitors measure
typically multiple pollutants and were likely to have been sited to meet a variety of goals, such as
11

This discussion draws heavily on Newell and Rogers (2003).

11

monitoring compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), public
reporting of the Air Quality Index (AQI), assessment of population exposure to pollutants,
assessment of pollutant transport, monitoring of specific emissions sources, monitoring of
background conditions, evaluating models, and possibly others.
Only a subset of air pollution monitors measured lead, and the number of lead monitors
varied over time. Figure 2 shows that the number of monitors measuring lead gradually increased
up to 1978 in anticipation of the implementation of NAAQS for lead, remained relatively stable
until 1988, and then sharply declined. 12 Lead measurements are available once every three
months before 1978. Beginning in 1978 the lead measurements are available monthly. Thus, we
begin our analysis in 1978 and end it in 1988, when the number of monitors began to decline.
We focus our attention on counties that have at least one lead monitor and have airborne
lead measurements before and after key dates for compliance with the phasedown of lead in
gasoline (October 1979 and July 1985). To construct our airborne lead measures we aggregate
monitor readings to a county level, by taking the average of all monitors in the county. As a
result, we have an unbalanced panel of 337 counties observed monthly over the period 19781988, covering over 40 percent of the U.S. population. Appendix A1 Figure A1.1 provides a map
showing the counties in our sample. Darker color represents the counties for which we have
observations approximately two thirds of the time. Our empirical analysis uses the unbalanced
panel of 337, but robustness checks are performed using the more balanced panel of 162
counties. 13
Figure 3 Panel A shows the decline in lead concentration in the monitors in our sample
over the period 1978-1988. The average lead level was 0.85 µg/m3 in 1978, but decreased to 0.10
µg/m3 in 1988, the last year of our study. For comparison, the current NAAQS for airborne lead
is 0.15 µg/m3.

12 According to the EPA (2007), this decline is attributable to the decrease in lead concentration observed during the
1980s and the need to fund new monitoring stations. Lead-TSP monitors in lower concentration areas were shut
down to free up resources needed to monitor other pollutants such as PM2.5 and ambient ozone.
13
Of the remaining 175 (=337-162) counties, 111 counties have observations 50 percent of the time and 64 counties
have observations 25 percent of the time. It is important to mention that the 337 counties account for about 44
percent of the U.S. population over the period 1978-1988. Later on, when we restrict attention to the subset of 170
counties with completed fertility data, those counties will represent about 39 percent of the U.S. population over the
census years 1980 and 1990.

Fertility Data
To study the effect of lead on short-run fertility, we use data from the National Vital
Statistics of the United States to construct the following outcomes: general fertility rate (GFR),
age-specific birth rates (ASBR), and birth counts by county-month, where county is the county
of residence. General fertility rates are constructed by dividing birth counts by the number of
females in childbearing age (15-44 years), in thousands, taken from the U.S. County-Level
Natality Data, 1978-2007. Age-specific birth rates (ASBR) are the number of live births to
women in a specific five-year age group divided by the number of women (in 1,000s) in the
same age group. We use the following five-year age groups: 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39,
and 40-44 years old.
To study the effect of lead on completed fertility, we use data from the 1980 and 1990
Censuses of Population, which asked women about children ever born. Because the IPUMS
dataset provides county identifiers only for counties with 100,000 population or more, we end up
with 252 counties. Although we run the analysis with all of them for comparison purposes, we
focus on the 170 counties overlapping with the 337 counties satisfying the restrictions for
availability of airborne lead information. 14

Additional Data
We include a number of control variables in the analysis: economic and demographics
covariates, climate variables, and mother and child characteristics. Economic and demographic
controls are from the U.S. Censuses, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), and the EPA.
Climatic variables are from the PRISM Climate Data. Mother and child characteristics are
county averages from the U.S. National Vital Statistics System.

14

We cannot use census data to run similar analysis for topsoil lead because the 2000 and 2010 Census did not ask
about children ever born. Nevertheless, we use the much smaller samples from the Current Population Survey
(IPUMS-CPS) – Fertility Supplement for June 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010 – to examine the effect of
exposure to topsoil lead on completed fertility in the 2000s. The average number of children ever born in this CPS
derived sample is 1.89. It contains 233 counties with population of 100,000 population or more, all of which overlap
with the counties in the main dataset for the topsoil lead analysis. For comparison purposes, our sample derived
from the two censuses (1980 and 1990) has 517,958 observations, whereas our CPS derived sample for the period
2000-2010 has only 15,855 observations. Therefore, we may lack statistical power to estimate the effects of interest
precisely.

Summary Statistics
Table 1 shows the summary statistics for the main variables used in our analysis. All
variables are weighed by the number of females of childbearing age (15-44 years). Table 1
reports the means and standard deviations for the variables used in the panel data analysis of the
effects of airborne lead on fertility over the period 1978-1988. Column 1 presents the summary
statistics for our sample of 337 counties over the period 1978-1988. Column 2 and 3 show the
means and standard deviations for the first and the last year in our sample: 1978 and 1988,
respectively. Average airborne lead is 0.35 µg/m3. The average monthly general fertility rate was
5.63 births per 1,000 women ages 15-44 over the period 1978-1988, and was increasing over this
study period. In 1978 the general fertility rate was 5.58, whereas in 1988 it was 5.78 births per
1,000 females of childbearing age. Figure 3 Panel B plots the general fertility rate over time.
Regarding completed fertility, the average number of children ever born by women 35-44 years
old in the 1980 and 1990 Censuses of Population is 2.15, dropping from 2.58 in 1980 to 1.89 in
1990. 15

4. Empirical Strategy

Airborne Lead and the General Fertility Rate
To uncover the causal effect of airborne lead pollution on fertility, we start by specifying
the following equation:
′
𝑁𝑁𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡+9 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝑋𝑋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐
𝛾𝛾 + 𝜂𝜂𝑐𝑐 + 𝜃𝜃𝑚𝑚 + 𝜆𝜆𝑦𝑦 + 𝑍𝑍𝑐𝑐′ 𝛿𝛿𝑦𝑦 + 𝜀𝜀𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ,

(3)

where 𝑁𝑁𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡+9 is a fertility outcome for county c, measured nine months in the future (t denotes

month-year), 16 AirLead is airborne lead pollution measured by EPA monitoring stations in
county c and month-year t, X is a set of time-varying controls such as temperature and
15

Appendix A1 Table A1.1 shows additional summary statistics on the age-specific birth rates and general fertility
by education and by race over the period 1978-1988.
16

Appendix A2 Figure A2.1 displays the estimated lead effect on alternative lags and leads of the general fertility
rate. The effects are similar to the baseline specification.

14

precipitation, 𝜂𝜂𝑐𝑐 is a set of county fixed effects, 𝜃𝜃𝑚𝑚 is a set of month fixed effects to deal with the
seasonal patterns of the variables of interest, 𝜆𝜆𝑦𝑦 is a set of year fixed effects, Z represents latitude

and longitude, which are interacted with year fixed effects to control for unobservable economic,

regulatory, and climatological conditions known to vary over space and time, and 𝜀𝜀 is an error

term. 17

To understand the timing in this equation along with the monthly variation of our
observations, recall that (i) the half-life of lead in blood is approximately 30 days, (ii) about 99
percent of the amount of lead taken into the body of an adult is excreted within a couple of
weeks (U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services 2007), and (iii) the adverse effects of lead on
animal serum testosterone and sperm parameters seem to reverse after a recovery period of about
30 days (Sokol 1989).
Our coefficient of interest is 𝛽𝛽. Because there may be important omitted time-varying

factors affecting the outcome variables that are correlated with AirLead, such as avoidance
behavior, it is likely that 𝛽𝛽̂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 is biased and inconsistent. In particular, if households avoid

exposure more often when lead concentration increases, and avoidance is positively related to
fertility, then the bias should be positive, and 𝛽𝛽̂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 underestimated. In addition, exposure to

airborne lead might be measured with error because of the potential disconnection between
where it is measured and where people live, leading to attenuation bias in the OLS estimate.

Instrumental Variable Approach
Instead of directly observing (and controlling for) defensive responses in the estimation
of the causal effect of lead on fertility, the strategy pursued in this study is to use instruments that
shift lead levels but are plausibly unrelated to avoidance behavior and measurement error. As
described in the introduction, we use the phasedown of lead in gasoline and its heterogeneous
effects depending on the quasi-experimental allocation of interstate highways according to the
17

We use a single-pollutant instead of a multi-pollutant approach because, as noted by Dominici et al. (2010), “the
results of any regression model become highly unstable when incorporating two or more pollutants that are highly
correlated (…). In this case, the regression model cannot reliably estimate the main effects of these two pollutants
nor their interaction.” Nevertheless, since lead affects the efficiency of catalytic converters, as noted previously, it is
important to at least control for multiple pollutants. An area experiencing a decrease in lead would also see a
decrease in other emissions, such as particulates, and it could be that particulates affect the health of family
members. In robustness checks reported in the appendix, we provide suggestive evidence that it is lead rather than
particulates the main criteria pollutant affecting fertility.

15

1944 plan, and the enforcement of the NAAQS for particulate matter in counties out of
compliance, as instruments for lead concentration.
The main assumption behind this instrumental variable approach is that it takes time for
the information about actual changes in lead content due to a policy change to reach households.
The regulatory oversight is targeted towards refineries and other major emitters in a county
rather than households. As a result, there is likely little change in avoidance response
immediately after each policy is implemented. At the same time, a decrease in lead due to policy
is reflected immediately in the airborne lead pollution levels, which is likely to start affecting
health outcomes immediately. While it is likely that households might have had some
information about the harmful effects of lead in gasoline even before the phasedown, it is
unlikely they were informed about the amount of lead in the “regular” gasoline, which was the
policy parameter that changed during the phasedown. Households might have had even less
information on the enforcement of NAAQS because only heavy emitter firms were dealing with
the regulators; hence, lack of salience might have been an issue. Therefore, we assume that those
instruments allow us to uncover the local average treatment effect. 18
Based on the Clean Air Act (CAA) regulations described in the background section, we
define four instrumental variables: (i) a dummy variable for the period October 1979–June 1985,
when the 0.8 gpg standards were in place, (ii) a dummy variable for the period starting in July
1985, when the standards were changed and tightened to 0.5 gplg, and interactions between (i)
and (ii) and an indicator variable for whether a county would have had an interstate highway
under the 1944 Interstate Highway System Plan (see Figure 4). Following Baum-Snow (2007)
and Michaels (2008), we use the advent of the U.S. Interstate Highway System Plan as a quasiexperimental allocation of highways to counties. 19 We exploit heterogeneity of the policy

18
Because the Current Population Survey (CPS) reveals that about nine percent of women in childbearing age (15 to
44 years) moved across counties annually in the 1980s (just below the percentage for men in the same age range), in
the results section we examine whether improvements in air quality changed the composition of the female
population ages 15-44 in counties with a planned highway or out of compliance with the NAAQS. This would imply
that the effects of lead on fertility would be driven in part by changes in the types of mothers giving birth in counties
affected by our instruments rather than a credible causal effect of lead exposure. Table A4.1 shows that there was
very little differential sorting based on observables.
19
In 1941, President Roosevelt appointed a National Interregional Highway Committee. This committee appears to
have been professional rather than political (U.S. Department Transportation, Federal Highway Administration,
2002). The highways were designed to address three policy goals (Michaels, 2008). First, they intended to improve
the connection between major metropolitan areas in the U.S. Second, they were planned to serve U.S. national
defense. And finally, they were designed to connect with major routes in Canada and Mexico. Congress acted on

16

changes based on the highway plan instead of the actual construction of interstate highways
because the willingness to invest in transportation infrastructure might be associated with
investment in other infrastructure projects such as schools, hospitals, and other health care
facilities, which would affect fertility and health outcomes more broadly. Since politicians
pushed for changes in highway routes in response to economic and demographic conditions of
their constituencies (see Baum-Snow 2007 and Michaels 2008), other local infrastructure
projects might have been affected as well. 20
The last instrumental variable is related to the CAA regulations for criteria pollutants. In
1978, EPA published a list of all “nonattainment” areas – counties out of compliance with the
NAAQS. For all criteria pollutants, the CAA Amendments of 1977 required that each
nonattainment area had to reach attainment “as expeditiously as practicable, but, in the case of
national primary ambient air quality standards, not later than December 31, 1982.” Because lead
is measured as a portion of total suspended particles (TSP), and particulate matter had been
regulated since 1971, we define the fifth instrumental variable in our analysis to be a dummy
variable indicating nonattainment status for TSP in 1978 interacted with the period of
enforcement, which began in January 1983. 21
By exploiting these policy changes in our instrumental variable approach, our first stage
equation is essentially a difference-in-differences equation. Counties recommended an interstate
highway by the 1944 plan are “treatment” counties, and counties without recommended
interstates are “control” counties. The “post” variables refer to the periods when the policy
changes were implemented. Likewise, counties out of compliance with the NAAQS are

these recommendations in the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944. In our analysis, we refer to the plan recommended
by that committee as the “1944 plan”. The construction of the Interstate Highway System began after funding was
approved in 1956, and by 1975 the system was mostly complete, spanning over 40,000 miles.
20

For completeness, the correlation between highways planned and highways built is only 0.5 in our sample. Less
than two thirds of the counties recommended a highway by the 1944 plan actually received a highway, and more
than ten percent of the counties that were not supposed to receive a highway by the plan had a highway built.
21

In an alternative specification where we decompose TSP into lead and other particles, we provide evidence that
lead is what drives the impacts on fertility (Appendix A2 Table A2.4). In the same table, we report similar estimates
for the lead effects when eliminating data for 1980-1982, a period of economic recessions that have been shown to
affect TSP concentration locally (Chay and Greenstone 2003). In another specification where we do not include this
instrument in the first stage, the main results are statistically the same (Appendix A2 Table A2.5, column 2). In the
last column of this last table, we also report estimates for the case where the first stage includes only the CAA
instrument. The IV estimate is noisier, but of comparable magnitude.

17

“treatment” counties, and counties in compliance are “control” counties. The “post” variable is
when the compliance with the NAAQS was expected, which in this case is colinear with year
fixed effects. The first stage equation is
𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝜋𝜋1 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎_0.8𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡

where c and t denote county and month-year, respectively. LeadPhaseDown_0.8gpg is a dummy
variable for the period October 1979–June 1985, when refineries were required to produce a
quarterly average of no more than 0.8 grams per gallon (gpg) among total gasoline output.
LeadPhaseDown_0.5gplg is a dummy variable for the period starting in July 1985, when the
standards were tightened to 0.5 gplg, and beginning in 1986 to 0.1 gplg. Again, gplg – grams per
leaded gallon – refers to the new rules specifically limiting the allowable content of lead in
leaded gasoline only. HWPlan1944 is an indicator for whether a county would be run through by
a highway as recommended by the 1944 Interstate Highway System Plan. The interactions with
HWPlan1944 are supposed to capture the intent-to-treat heterogenous effects associated with
potential exposure to lead in gasoline burned and emitted in highways. Attainment is an indicator
for the period starting in January 1983, when counties out of compliance regarding TSP
standards were supposed to comply with CAA regulations, as required by the 1977
Amendments. CAANAS_TSP1978 is a dummy variable for whether a county was designated in
nonattainment with the TSP standards, as published by EPA for the first time in 1978. CAANAS
stands for Clean Air Act Non-Attainment Status. 22
22

The timing of the policy changes leveraged in our empirical analysis may raise a concern related to the oil shock
of 1979. Although this event may have affected vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and consequently local air pollution,
the nationwide VMT is stable or slightly growing in our period of study, and has a similar pattern for urban and rural
counties. (The figure is available at https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/pubs/hf/pl10023/fig2_4.cfm, and
was accessed in March 2018). Nevertheless, in our regressions we include year fixed effects, as well as interactions
of year fixed effects with county-centroid latitude and longitude. These explanatory variables should capture the
effects of macroeconomic shocks such as the oil crisis, and local shocks as associated with the geographic
coordinates of each county centroid.

18

To illustrate the heterogeneous effects of the phasedown of lead in gasoline based on
highways, Figure 5 Panel A plots the decline in airborne lead levels over time for counties with
and without highways in the 1944 Interstate Highway System Plan. The airborne lead level was
initially higher in the counties with highways. During 1980-1986 there was a gradual decline in
the lead level. By the end of our study period lead levels were about the same in counties with
and without highways.
Likewise, Figure 5 Panel B plots fertility for counties with and without highways as
recommended by the 1944 Interstate Highway System Plan along with the timing of the
phasedown of lead in gasoline. Before the policy change, fertility was lower in counties with
planned highways. Over time, however, the fertility rate was becoming higher in counties with
planned highways than in counties without planned highways. 23

Changes in County Composition in Response to Policy Changes
An important concern for our study is that improvements in air quality might change the
composition of the population in counties with a planned highway or counties that are out of
compliance with the NAAQS. This could lead to changes in the characteristics of the mothers in
these counties. For example, families may respond to the phase-down of lead in gasoline or the
enforcement of the air quality standards by differentially moving in or out of the counties with
clean air. This is particularly relevant as Chay and Greenstone (2005) find that CAAA
nonattainment designation is associated with increases in housing values nearly 10 years after the
legislation went into effect. If these increases in housing values reflect that higher socioeconomic
status families are migrating to counties with cleaner air (Banzhaf and Walsh 2008), then we
may observe changes in the underlying population characteristics. 24 This would imply that the
effects of lead on fertility may be driven in part by changes in the types of mothers giving birth
in counties affected by our instruments rather than a causal effect of lead exposure.

23

Appendix A1 Figure A1.4 plots annual general fertility rates for counties with and without highways as
recommended by the 1944 Interstate Highway System Plan for the longer period 1972-1998, providing suggestive
evidence that fertility trends in those two groups of counties were similar for several years before and after our
period of analysis (1978-1988). Appendix A1 Figure A1.5 displays similar information for airborne lead
concentration. Again, there seems to be no differential trends for those two groups of counties before and after our
period of analysis.
24 The proportion of houses built in the 1980s is similar across counties with and without highways as recommended
by the 1944 Interstate Highway System Plan, and across counties with different nonattainment status for TSP.

19

Appendix A4 Table A4.1 investigates whether our instrumental variables led to a
compositional shift in the underlying female population in counties with a planned highway or in
nonattainment. The results provide little evidence for differential sorting along observables that
might bias our estimates. Most point estimates are statistically insignificant and small in
magnitude, and the signs of the coefficients suggest that our estimates, if anything, may be only
slightly biased. For instance, the enforcement of the NAAQS for PM in nonattainment counties
might have led to slightly more single-mother households in those counties, which could slightly
bias our estimates upward (in absolute terms), and more whites, which could slightly bias our
estimates downward.

Airborne Lead and Completed Fertility
To examine the impact of exposure to airborne lead on completed fertility (number of
children ever born by women 35-44 years old), we combine the individual level data from the
1980 and 1990 Censuses of Population. Although we cannot follow each woman over time, by
stacking those two cross-sections together we are able to include county fixed effects in the
regression model for completed fertility, controlling for a number of observable and
unobservable time-invariant factors affecting fertility behavior of all women living in the same
county, either in 1980 or 1990. Our estimating equation is:
′
𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
𝛾𝛾 + 𝜂𝜂𝑐𝑐 + 𝜆𝜆𝑦𝑦 + 𝑍𝑍𝑐𝑐′ 𝛿𝛿𝑦𝑦 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

(4)

where Fict is the number of children a woman has ever had, excluding stillbirths. Notice that this
analysis is done with individual-level data: i represents a woman living in county c during census
year y. AirLead is the county-level average of all EPA lead monitor readings for the years 19781984 (for Census year 1980), and 1985-1990 (for Census year 1990). X includes all the
meteorological variables from equation (3) and a number of characteristics of the woman and her
household such as age, education, race, marital status, socioeconomic status, and household
income (a detailed list of these variables is provided in the notes of the results table). Again, 𝜂𝜂𝑐𝑐

is a set of county fixed effects, 𝜆𝜆𝑦𝑦 is a set of year fixed effects, Z represents latitude and
longitude interacted with year fixed effects, and 𝜀𝜀 is an error term.

20

Because of similar identification issues discussed in the previous subsection, we
implement an IV approach to estimate the parameter of interest 𝛽𝛽. We use as instrument the
phasedown of lead in gasoline in the 1980s particularly in counties receiving a highway as

recommended by the 1944 Interstate Highway System Plan. In practice, we interact a dummy
variable for 1990 with HWPlan1944. The intuition is that by 1990 the phasedown of lead in
gasoline would be already in effect, hence affecting more the air quality in counties with
potential roads. The relevance condition is satisfied empirically: a relatively strong first-stage Fstatistic will be reported later. We then assume that the exclusion restriction also holds in this
context. In fact, as argued in the previous subsection, it is unlikely that reductions in gasoline
lead would affect fertility behavior differentially in counties with a highway from the 1944 plan
other than via reductions in air pollution.

5. Impacts of Airborne Lead Exposure on Fertility

Effects on the General Fertility Rate
We start by reporting our findings for the panel data analysis on the impact of exposure to
airborne lead on fertility over the period 1978-1988. Table 2 presents the first stage relationship
between our instruments and airborne lead. Columns 1 and 2 include no controls and only county
fixed effects. Column 2 shows that airborne lead fell after the two regulatory milestones LPD0.8𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔
and LPD0.5𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔. The reduction associated with the second milestone, however, was over 50 percent

larger than the first one, likely due to the more stringent standards. Moreover, the interaction
terms indicate that it fell more in counties that were to receive highways under the 1944 highway
plan, and fell more in counties that were out of attainment with the TSP standards, as published
by EPA for the first time in 1978. In columns 3-5, the coefficients on LPD0.8𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 and LPD0.5𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 are

no longer significant with the inclusion of year and month fixed effects. The coefficients on the
interaction terms, however, are quite stable as additional controls are included. The first stage Fstatistics on the excluded instruments are all above 20, suggesting relatively strong instruments. 25

25

In Appendix A2 Table A2.8, we compare the first stage estimates for airborne lead with corresponding estimates
for sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ambient ozone. Sulfur dioxide is a gas primarily emitted from fossil fuel combustion at
power plants and other industrial facilities. Only a small fraction of SO2 emissions in the United States come from
transportation. Ozone is not emitted directly; instead formation occurs due to a complex combination of nitrogen

21

Table 3 presents the OLS and IV results for the general fertility rate. 26 For OLS, the
coefficient is not statistically significant in column 1. As additional controls are added in
columns 2-5, the coefficient on airborne lead becomes negative and significant. For the IV
specifications in columns 6-10, the coefficient on airborne lead is uniformly negative,
statistically significant and much larger in magnitude than for OLS. 27 The larger coefficient in
the IV specification is consistent with the presence of the household avoidance behavior and/or
measurement error associated with the potential disconnection between where airborne lead is
measured and where people live.
Table A2.1 reports results estimated by two-stage least squares (2SLS) versus limited
information maximum likelihood (LIML), and for eastern versus western U.S. counties. 28 The
LIML estimates in column 2 are remarkably similar to the 2SLS ones in column 1, revealing
once again that our instruments are relatively strong, and that despite being much larger than
OLS, our 2SLS estimates are reliable. Two reasons why the 2SLS estimates are over nine times
larger than OLS may be the presence of nonclassical measurement error and heterogeneous
effects. In fact, the estimates for eastern versus western U.S. in columns 3 and 4 provide
suggestive evidence on those issues.
Because airborne lead concentration is measured in places where EPA has pollution
monitors, but individuals usually cross county boundaries when commuting to work or engaging
in leisure activities, exposure to airborne lead might be more severely mismeasured in the eastern
part of the country, where commuting zones are geographically smaller (see a detailed discussion
oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and sunlight. Although on-road vehicles contribute to
emissions of both ozone precursors, meteorological conditions are important confounders in the relationship
between these pollutants and ambient ozone concentration. Therefore, it is not surprising that there seems to be no
systematic relationship between the policy changes used in the first stage lead regressions and SO2 and ozone
concentration, as reported in referred table.
26

In unreported regressions, we also examined the impacts of lead exposure on infant mortality, birth weight and
male to female sex ratio. Although with the expected signs, those effects were imprecisely estimated. It is important
to notice, however, that recent research by Sauve-Syed (2017) has revealed impacts of cumulative blood lead
exposure on another short-run outcome in older children – academic achievement of elementary school students.
She exploited an exogenous, heterogeneous shock of lead-in-water levels within classrooms at Flint Community
Schools to overcome the selection and endogeneity issues found in other studies.
27
Hausman tests of the equality of the OLS and the IV estimates are shown in Appendix A4 Table A4.2. For
airborne lead, the confidence intervals are slightly wider for the IV estimates, so that they marginally do not differ
significantly from the OLS estimates (p-value: 0.13, see Table A4.2).
28

LIML is a one-stage IV estimator that provides more reliable point estimates and test statistics with potentially
weak instruments. It is known to be less precise but also less biased than 2SLS.

22

on the definitions of commuting zones in Foote, Kutzbach, and Vilhuber (2017), including a map
of commuting zones in their Figure 1). By driving regularly across county boundaries,
individuals are likely to be exposed not only to the lead measured in their county of residence but
also to the lead present in highways, including in neighboring counties. Therefore, measurement
error might be systematically associated with location, which we approximate by the dichotomy
eastern versus western U.S.
Despite the relatively large standard errors, the estimates in columns 3 and 4 of Table
A2.1 are indeed consistent with worse measurement problems in the eastern U.S. The
interactions of the indicator for a highway recommended by the 1944 plan and policy changes
regarding the phase-down of lead in gasoline, which are used as instruments, should capture the
variation in exposure to airborne lead more accurately than just the readings of the EPA
monitors, and even more so in eastern counties. The estimates in columns 3 and 4 also indicate
the presence of heterogeneous effects. To the extent that residents in the western part of the
country seem to be willing to drive longer distances (again, see the map of commuting zones in
Foote, Kutzbach, and Vilhuber (2017)), they might be exposed to less airborne lead because
emissions should be more spread out. Though imprecisely estimated, the effect of airborne lead
in western counties appears to be much smaller than in eastern counties. Therefore, our estimates
might reveal only local average treatment effects. 29
That said, the IV estimates of lead on fertility rates are sizeable. The airborne lead levels
declined on average by 0.75 µg/m3 over the study period. Thus, the IV estimates imply an
increase in the monthly general fertility rate by 0.38 births per 1,000 women ages 15-44. Given
that the average monthly fertility rate in our sample is 5.63 and the standard deviation is 0.92, the
increase is 6.7 percent of the mean and 41 percent of a standard deviation.
Using the estimates in Table 3 (column 5), Figure 6 illustrates the effects of the decline in
airborne lead on fertility rate and number of births. The left-hand-side panels show that the
fertility rate would have fallen had lead remained at its 1978 level. The right-hand-side panels
show the number of births. The decline in lead increased the number of births by about 95,000

29

It is worth mentioning that the difference between the OLS and IV estimates found here are in the range published
elsewhere in the economics literature. Madestam et al. (2013), for instance, report IV estimates up to over 28 times
larger than OLS. They also explain their results based on nonclassical measurement error and heterogenous effects.

per year by the end of our sample period relative to what they would have been had lead
remained at its 1978 level.
To better understand the magnitude of our estimates on general fertility, we compare
them to the impact of two important events affecting fertility behavior in 20th century U.S.: the
introduction of the contraceptive pill in 1957, and the implementation of federal family planning
programs in 1964. It is worth explicitly noting that the effects of lead in 1978-1988 are quite
different from these two events, because they involve involuntary exposure of large populations.
Bailey (2010, 2013) provides quasi-experimental evidence that the availability of the birth
control pill decreased annual general fertility rates by approximately 7 births per 1,000 women of
childbearing age (15 to 44 years) in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Bailey (2012, 2013) also
finds causal evidence that annual general fertility rates declined by 1.5 births per 1,000 women
of childbearing age after family planning programs reached their full capacity in the late 1960s.
Our estimates imply that the average reduction of airborne lead in 1978-1988 increased annual
general fertility rates by approximately 4.5 births per 1,000 women of childbearing age.
Therefore, our estimated impacts are sizeable, but less than the effect of the pill. 30

Robustness Checks: Alternative Measures of Fertility, Sample Restrictions, and Other Pollutants
Our main analysis is robust to alternative measures of fertility, sample restrictions, and
the inclusion of other air pollutants in the analysis. Table A2.2 in the Appendix presents OLS
and IV estimates for the effect of lead on additional measures of fertility: number of births, log of
number of births, and log of the general fertility rate. The estimated effects are negative and
qualitatively similar.
Table A2.3 restricts attention to a more balanced sample. Specifically, we use only
counties with airborne lead monitor readings for two-thirds of the months between 1978 and
1988. The estimated effects are also negative and qualitatively similar, suggesting that the
attrition and addition of airborne lead monitors over time, as illustrated in Figure 2, are unlikely
to significantly bias our main findings.

30

Also, it is important to point out that while Bailey’s analysis includes the entire country, our airborne lead analysis
includes only 337 counties that have air quality monitors, representing 44 percent of the population. Because lead
monitoring likely targeted more polluted areas, our fertility results for lead in air might not be representative for the
whole country.

24

Table A2.4 provides evidence that what we estimate is indeed the fertility effect of lead
and not other pollutants measured in total suspended particulates (TSP). In column 1 we repeat
our main specification. In column 2 we estimate the effect of TSP on fertility. The coefficient is
negative but not statistically significant. This could be because our instruments are better
predictors for lead than for TSP. In column 3 we include both lead and the part of TSP without
lead, constructed as a residual of a regression of TSP on lead. The coefficient on lead in column
3 is not statistically significant, but is similar in magnitude to the coefficient in column 1. Lastly,
in column 4 we report estimates for lead but eliminating data for the years 1980-1982, which
have been shown to affect TSP due to the economic recessions occurring in that period (Chay
and Greenstone 2003). We cannot rule out that these estimates are the same as our main results.

Heterogeneity Analysis: Effects of Lead on General Fertility by Age and Education
Table 4 explores the effects of airborne lead on fertility by age. Columns 1 through 6
shows the effects of airborne lead on age specific birth rates. In particular, we consider the
following five-year age groups: 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, and 40-44 years old. The
coefficient on lead is negative and statistically significant for younger women, ages 15-19 and
20-24. At the same time, younger women are responsible for more births. Women ages 20-24,
who are at peak fertility, are responsible for 30 percent of the births in our sample. 31 The
coefficient on airborne lead for these women is negative and statistically significant. Given that
the mean fertility rate for this group is 8.95 and the standard deviation is 2.24, the increase is 10
percent of the mean and 42 percent of a standard deviation.
The coefficients on airborne lead for older women are negative but not statistically
significant. Older women may have had longer exposure to airborne lead pollution than younger
women. If there is a cumulative negative effect of lead on fertility, then the fertility rate among
older women might be less responsive to the short-term lead fluctuations. Alternatively, if older
mothers engage more in avoidance behavior due to greater income, or there is greater

The mean age at first birth in 1978 was 22.4 (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr51/nvsr51_01.pdf).

25

measurement error for older mothers potentially because of more relocations, or both, we would
expect to observe greater attenuation bias for this group. 32
Table 5 examines the effects of airborne lead on fertility by education. Educational
attainment is not available for all mothers due to missing data. To perform this analysis, we
restrict the sample to the births for which we have complete information. 33 Column 1 shows the
result for all mothers using this restricted sample. Column 2 shows the effect for women who are
high school dropouts. They account for 21 percent of the total number of births in the sample.
Given that the mean fertility rate for this group is 6.02 and the standard deviation is 1.58, the
increase is 5.3 percent of the mean and 20 percent of a standard deviation due to the average lead
reduction over the study period (0.75 µg/m3). Column 3 shows the effect for women who have
high school education or higher. Given that the mean fertility rate for this group is 5.70 and the
standard deviation is 0.91, the increase is 5.7 percent of the mean and 35 percent of a standard
deviation. Results from this table suggest that lead has similar effects for lower and more highly
educated mothers. 34

Short-term Effects on General Fertility versus Completed Fertility
One concern regarding our main results on the effects of lead on the general fertility rate
is that they might reflect only a short-term impact on fertility. Women who would not have a
successful pregnancy early on in the reproductive cycle would keep trying having babies until
later years. Therefore, the short-term effects of lead on fertility would be reversed, and there
would be no impact on completed fertility. That does not seem the case in our analysis using
Census data. Table 6 presents the OLS and IV results for completed fertility for women ages 3544. Results are presented for two groups: all women in the age range, and only stayers – women

32
There may be greater measurement error if older mothers live further from lead monitors than younger mothers. If
air pollution monitors are concentrated in cities more often than in suburban areas, and older mothers are more likely
to live in the suburbs, this pattern could be potentially explained by such time-varying mismatch.
33

Specifically, the sample is restricted to counties with the education information available for 97 percent of the
total birth records in a county-month-year.

34
Although we cannot perform the analysis by bins of education and race due to data limitations, we did the analysis
separately by race groups to examine the effect of airborne lead on fertility rates among white and non-white
mothers. The point estimates suggest the effects are coming primarily from white mothers. Nevertheless, we cannot
rule out that the effects are statistically similar for white and non-white mothers as shown in the Appendix A2 Table
A2.6.

26

who were living in the same county five years before and in their state of birth. Panel A presents
the OLS specifications. For all women and stayers, the coefficient on airborne lead is negative
and statistically significant. Moreover, the coefficients are similar in magnitude. Panel B presents
the first stage relationship between our Highway 1944 instrument and airborne lead. The firststage F-statistic is above 15 in both specifications. Panel C presents the IV estimates on
completed fertility. The airborne lead levels declined on average by 0.32 for the full sample and
0.29 for stayers over the study period. Thus, the IV estimates imply an increase in cumulative
fertility of 0.14 children for all women ages 35-44 and 0.18 children for stayers. These represent
increases in cumulative fertility of 6.4 percent for all women and 8.7 percent for stayers. The
effects on cumulative fertility for all women are very similar in magnitude to the effects found on
the general fertility rate in Table 3 (6.4 percent vs. 6.7 percent).

6. Current Impacts: Exposure to Lead in Soil and Fertility

To explore the current relevance of our findings, and shed light on the legacy effects of
airborne lead, we estimate the effect of lead topsoil on fertility in the 2000s. Historical airborne
lead emissions were deposited and accumulated in topsoil for several decades (Mielke, Laidlaw,
and Gonzales 2011), and have been shown to affect other important societal outcomes (Clay,
Portnykh, and Severnini 2019). For this analysis, we use data on lead concentration in soil from
the U.S. Geological Survey. A survey was carried out in the 2000s to study the concentration and
spatial distribution of chemical elements and minerals in soils of the conterminous United States.
Soils samples were collected from a depth of 0 to 5 cm. Appendix Figure A1.2 displays a map of
the 4,857 soil sampling sites in the conterminous United States. 35
To generate county-level data on topsoil lead concentration, we average the
measurements of all available samples within a county. We observe the latitude and longitude of
each site. As a result, we have information for 2096 counties, as shown in Figure A1.3 in the

35

The sampling sites (1 site per 1,600 km2) were selected based on the generalized random tessellation stratified
(GRTS) design, which produces a spatially balanced set of sampling points without adhering to a strict grid-based
system.

27

Appendix. 36 To explore the potentially nonlinear effects of topsoil lead on fertility, we create an
indicator variable for whether the lead concentration in a particular county is above or below the
median topsoil lead concentration, calculated using the sample for the whole nation. Table A1.2
reports the summary statistics for the topsoil lead analysis. The average annual general fertility
rate is 67.68 births per 1,000 women ages 15-44. The fertility rate is 69.89 births per 1,000
women for the low lead counties, whereas it is 65.52 in the high lead counties.
Because we have only one measurement of lead in topsoil, we use a cross-sectional
approach. This empirical strategy allows us to document trends in fertility due to continued
exposure to lead pollution on a longer-term basis. We estimate the following regression model:
𝑁𝑁𝑐𝑐 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑐𝑐 + 𝑋𝑋𝑐𝑐 𝛾𝛾 + 𝜂𝜂𝑠𝑠 + 𝜀𝜀𝑐𝑐 ,

(5)

where 𝑁𝑁𝑐𝑐 is a fertility outcome for county c in 2005, SoilLead is a dummy variable indicating

whether the lead in topsoil in a county c is above the median of lead concentration 37 , 𝑋𝑋𝑐𝑐

represents various county level controls such as climate, county specific demographic and
economic characteristics (listed in the data section above), and 𝜂𝜂𝑠𝑠 represents state fixed effects. 38

We estimate this equation using another instrumental variable strategy, using only the

1944 Interstate Highway System Plan as an instrument for SoilLead. By affecting the location of
the major highways built with the funds earmarked by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956
(Baum-Snow 2007, Michaels 2008), the 1944 plan generates variation in how much lead from
36
As a result of this procedure, we may have more than one measurement for a county with a large area, but may not
have information for a county with a small area.
37

Because there is considerable heterogeneity in guidelines for “safe levels” of topsoil lead concentration (Jennings
2013), we use the observed median lead level in our sample as a threshold to allow for potential nonlinear effects.
Also, because we have only one instrument, we are restricted to have only one measure of topsoil lead. The
unreported linear specification coefficient generate qualitatively similar results, but is imprecisely estimated (-0.367
S.E. 0.224).
38

Similar to the analysis for airborne lead, we adopt a single pollutant approach to examine the impact of topsoil
lead on fertility. The continental-scale soil geochemical survey of the 2000s also collected information on other
hazardous chemicals such as cadmium, mercury, and nickel. If a subset of these additional chemicals also affects
fertility outcomes negatively, such as potentially cadmium (e.g., Benoff, Jacob and Hurley 2000, Pollack et al.
2014), SoilLead may represent a sufficient statistic of exposure to contaminated soil. To the extent that some of the
chemicals, such as cadmium, may also be added to soils adjacent to roads – the sources being tires and lubricant oils
(Wuana and Okieimen 2011) – our instrumental variable might capture variation on them as well. In the appendix
table A3.1, we report a horserace analysis. The results indicate that lead is the main driving force behind our
findings.

28

gasoline was deposited and historically accumulated in the topsoil. This is an intent-to-treat
(ITT) strategy that addresses the unobserved association between lead in soil and defensive
responses, and measurement error associated with the potential disconnection between soil
sampling sites and household residences. The actual highways would not be a valid instrument
because the exact location of a highway within a county might have been influenced by
unobserved voters’ preference for air quality and other infrastructure projects that affect fertility,
such as hospitals. In other words, they would be correlated to avoidance behavior and
remediation, therefore not tackling the omitted variable bias associated with defensive
investments. In our ITT approach, however, we isolate the portion of the cross-sectional
variation in lead in topsoil that is related only to the highways that were built following exactly
the 1944 plan. This variation should be unrelated to voters’ preferences: the design of the 1944
plan was not supposed to reflect local preferences, but rather address primarily national security
issues. Therefore, our instrument should satisfy both the relevance condition and the exclusion
restriction.

Effects on the General Fertility Rate
Table 7 presents the first stage relationship between our instrument and the indicator for
having a lead concentration in topsoil above the national median in 2005. In columns 1-6, the
coefficients on the indicator for Highway Plan 1944 are positive and statistically significant. The
coefficient in column 6 is 0.104. This means that having a highway recommended by the 1944
plan increases the probability of experiencing lead concentrations in topsoil above the national
median by 10.4 percentage points on average. The first stage F-statistics for the excluded
instrument are all above the rule-of-thumb 10, suggesting a strong instrumental variable.
Table 8 shows the effect of lead in topsoil on the 2005 general fertility rate. 39 Panel A
presents the results estimated using OLS. Panel B reports the results estimated by IV. As in the
panel analysis, both OLS and IV estimates are negative, and OLS estimates are much smaller in
magnitude than IV estimates. In this case, the Hausman test rejects the equality of the OLS and
the IV estimates, as reported in Appendix in Table A4.2. Column 1 presents the estimated effect
only controlling for state fixed effects and climate variables to account for unobserved state
39

We report similar estimates for the 2004 and 2006 cross sections in Appendix Table A3.2.

29

specific variables. Columns 2-5 add controls. The IV coefficients on topsoil lead is negative,
statistically significant, and stable across specifications. If lead concentration in counties with
lead concentration above the median were to decrease to the levels in counties with lead
concentration below the median, the fertility rate would increase by 7.8 births per 1,000 women
ages 15-44, which is 11 percent of the mean of fertility rate.
Again, measurement error and heterogeneous effects may explain the large difference
between the IV and OLS estimates. With respect to measurement, to the extent that the soil
samples were spatially balanced (see Figure A1.2 for the location of all sampling points), the
distinction between the lead effects in eastern versus western counties becomes less important, as
we can see in column 2 of Table A3.3. 40 In fact, both estimates are somewhat similar to the
overall estimate reported in column 1 for comparison. Nevertheless, given the guidelines for the
site selection process, and the randomness of the GRTS design, the USGS measurements might
not reflect the true exposure to topsoil lead that households face on a regular basis. Rather, they
may imply severe classical measurement error. Therefore, it is not surprising that we find a large
difference between IV and OLS estimates, even larger than in the context of airborne lead. 41
Such a difference might also be due to heterogeneous effects. In particular, our estimate
might reflect a local treatment effect associated with lead deposited in topsoil from gasolinepowered vehicles before the ban of leaded gasoline. Because our instrument – an indicator for
potentially receiving a highway from the 1944 plan – might capture better the lead deposited in
topsoil that was emitted decades ago by vehicles versus stationary sources, we should expect the
IV estimate for places with high gasoline consumption to be larger than for places with low
consumption. Indeed, using a state-level measure of the amount of gasoline lead released into the
immediate environment of the average individual based on the different grades of gasoline and
the shares of those grades used in each state (see Reyes 2008), we find an IV estimate for
counties located in states with that measure of lead above the median to be much larger than for
counties in low-lead states, as reported in column 3 of Table A3.3. Although imprecisely
40

The U.S. Geological Survey carried out a survey of soils using a generalized random tessellation stratified
(GRTS) design to produce a spatially balanced set of sampling points without adhering to a strict grid-based system.
Also, to ensure that samples were not collected from obviously contaminated areas, no sample was collected within
(i) 200 meters of a major highway; (ii) 50 meters of a rural road; (iii) 100 meters of a building or structure; or (iv) 5
kilometers downwind of active major industrial activities such as power plants or smelters.
41

As noted before, the difference found here is still much smaller than the difference between OLS and IV estimates
found elsewhere in the broad economics literature (e.g., Madestam et al. 2013).

30

estimated, those point estimates suggest the presence of considerable heterogeneity in the effects
of topsoil lead on fertility. Moreover, they indicate that our instrument does capture variation in
topsoil lead emitted in previous decades by an important source: gas-powered vehicles.
To put our result in perspective, it is useful to consider the increase in the number of
babies implied by our coefficients and compare the estimated effects with the impact of the
introduction of the contraceptive pill in 1957. Given that there were about 21 million women of
childbearing age living in counties with lead concentration above the median in 2005, the
estimated effect would imply about 166 thousand more babies would be born if lead
concentrations in those counties were reduced. This would represent a 5 percent increase in the
overall number of newborns. Recall that Bailey (2010, 2013) found the availability of the birth
control pill decreased annual general fertility rates by approximately 7 births per 1,000 women of
childbearing age in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Our estimate of 7.8 births per 1,000 women is
similar in magnitude to the effect of the pill. 42

Robustness Checks: Addressing Additional Sources of Endogeneity
A nontrivial threat to our identification strategy regards two other potential channels
through which the 1944 interstate highway plan might affect fertility: impacts on commuting
time, and impacts on access to health care. If the interstate highway system simultaneously
reduces commuting time, then female labor force participation might increase (Black,
Kolesnikova, and Taylor 2014), and fertility might decrease. Likewise, if highways also reduce
the cost to seek infertility treatment and prenatal care in locations nearby, then fertility might
increase.
To isolate the effect of exposure to topsoil lead on fertility from the potential impacts of
commuting time and access to health care, we consider an alternative specification in the
appendix including these two additional variables, and using alternative instruments for them.
We instrument commuting time with county-level hydropower potential. Severnini (2014) shows
that economic activity historically concentrated around hydroelectric dams due to transmission
42

The 2000 and 2010 Census did not ask about children ever born, so instead we use the much smaller samples from
the Current Population Survey (CPS) – Fertility Supplement for June 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010 – to
provide suggestive evidence that exposure to topsoil lead above the national median decreases completed fertility by
0.17 children per woman, which is 9.3 percent of mean fertility. Given that the sample size here is less than five
percent the sample size derived from the Census, it is not surprising that our estimates are imprecisely estimated, as
shown in the Appendix Table A3.4.

31

constraints, which could potentially reduce urban sprawl. We instrument the number of
physicians per 100,000 population, which we use a proxy for access to health care, with the
funds distributed by the Hill-Burton Free and Reduced-Cost Health Care of 1946. Those funds
are associated with the construction of new hospitals, and expansion of the number of hospital
beds in the U.S. (Chung, Gaynor, and Richards-Shubik 2017).
Importantly, conditional on the other instruments, our original instrument (1944 Interstate
Highway Plan) is not statistically significantly correlated to commuting time and the rate of
physicians (see Appendix A4 Table A4.3). Furthermore, the impact of exposure to topsoil lead
on fertility is similar to our main estimates, and the coefficients of commuting time and the rate
of physicians are not statistically significant (see Appendix A4 Table A4.4). Therefore, our main
specification appears robust to this alternative specification.

7. Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations of Benefits and Costs of Reducing Lead Exposure

This study’s results allow us to conduct a simple cost-benefit analysis for policies
reducing lead in the air and in topsoil. As we noted in the introduction, how these private utility
gains translate into social benefits from the births of additional children is an open question.
Whatever the social benefits of fertility, reductions in lead have large social benefits including
improvements in IQ and school outcomes and reductions in crime (e.g., Needleman 2004, Aizer
and Currie 2017, Sauve-Syed 2017, Aizer et al. 2018, Gronqvist et al. 2018, and Billings and
Schnepel, 2018). For the sake of argument, we assume below that fertility benefits are counted as
social benefits.
One way to monetize the implied benefits of the effects of exposure to lead on fertility is
to assume that parents obtain utility from children over their lifetime. Let us assume that on
average the satisfaction parents would obtain from having children would be at least the amount
spent in bringing them up. If this is true, then we can multiply the number of additional babies by
the cost of raising a child from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). 43 The total annual

43

This value is computed for every year, and can be accessed at https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2017/01/13/costraising-child . An alternative would be to use the value of a statistical life (VSL) recommended by EPA ($6 million
(2013 USD) in 1980s and $7.7 million (2013 USD) in the early 2000s). If that is the case, the annual benefits would

32

benefits for airborne lead based on births in 1988 would be at least $18.3 billion (2013 USD), as
shown in Table 9, Panel A, column 1. 44 The total annual benefits for lead in topsoil based on
births in 2005 would be $33.4 billion (2013 USD), as reported Table 9, Panel B, column 1. 45
The willingness to pay for reductions in lead should also include the amount spent to
avoid exposure. 46 Building on Moretti and Neidell (2011), we provide a measure of such cost by
comparing the OLS and IV estimates for the impact of lead exposure on fertility rates, and
multiplying the implied number of additional babies by the USDA value of raising a child. The
idea behind that comparison is that the OLS estimate might reflect the causal effect of lead on
fertility plus the (positive) bias arising from unobserved avoidance behavior. Under the
assumption that our instruments are unrelated to household avoidance responses, the IV estimate
would reflect only the causal effect of lead exposure on fertility. Hence, the difference should
represent the implied amount invested in avoiding exposure. 47
To provide estimates of the costs incurred in reducing lead in the air and in topsoil, we
rely on the policies associated with our instrumental variables. During much of our sample
period, refineries produced both leaded and unleaded gasoline. Assuming that the prices faced
be $565 billion (2013 USD) for the reduction in airborne lead and $1.3 trillion (2013 USD) for the reduction in
topsoil lead.
44 For comparison, EPA estimated nationwide ex-ante benefits of approximately $1.2 billion (2013 USD) for 1988
in their cost-benefit analysis of the reduction of lead in gasoline (EPA 1985). Because EPA did not consider fertility
impacts, our findings would increase the annual overall benefits considerably.
45

Because abortion has been legalized in the U.S. since the landmark ruling by the Supreme Court in 1973, and the
pill and family planning services were disseminated before our period of analysis, we have assumed that all those
additional babies were not unwanted.
46

Appendix A2 Table A2.7 presents state level evidence from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) that
high airborne lead concentration is associated with higher probability of seeking an infertility treatment. This
evidence actually inspires another way to monetize the benefits of lead reduction. Indeed, both private households
and society (via publicly funded health services organizations) incur high costs to treat infertility (Bitler and
Schmidt 2012, Chambers, Adamson, and Marinus 2013). As an example, a fresh in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle
costs approximately $13,000 in the United States. Therefore, one could multiply the number of additional babies
born because of the lead reduction by the average cost of infertility treatment to obtain an alternative measure of
those benefits.

47

The drawback of the OLS-IV comparison is that both avoidance behavior and measurement error in lead exposure
generate a bias in the (negative) coefficient of interest towards zero. Thus, one should use caution in interpreting this
back of the envelope calculation. Nevertheless, it is straightforward to assume that a proportion of the OLS-IV
difference is due to attenuation bias, and still obtain a measure for the investment in avoidance. For example, using
Aizer et al. (2018)’s largest increase in the coefficients of interest when instrumenting to correct for measurement
error – IV estimates three times larger than OLS – we would find that avoidance benefits would be $7.6 billion
(2013 USD)..

33

by consumers reflected the marginal cost by refineries, the difference between the prices of
leaded and unleaded gasoline may represent a measure of the costs of those regulations. In the
late 1980s, this difference was 10 cents per gallon (2013 USD) (EIA). Multiplying this difference
by the consumption of unleaded gasoline (Newell and Rogers 2003), a back of the envelope
calculation of the annual costs during the 1980s would be $3 billion (2013 USD). 48 This measure
might be an underestimation of the true costs. We are not including potential productivity effects
for the refineries and automakers or the direct implementation costs by EPA. For soil, we use the
average cost per household of cleaning up lead contaminated soil based on EPA estimates
associated with the Superfund program (West Oakland Residential Lead Assessment, EPA
2010): $38,000 (2013 USD) per residential lot, assuming the average lot size is 15,300 square
feet and cleaning is happening at a depth of 8-9 inches.
The fertility benefits from reductions in airborne lead alone appear to exceed the costs
associated with unleaded gasoline. For soil, the relationship between costs and benefits are not
as clear, because cleanup has not actually occurred. The annual value of the fertility benefits
would be sufficient to fund the cleanup of about 878,000 residential lots annually. Overall, it
appears that policies reducing concentration of lead in the air and in topsoil generate large
benefit-cost ratios.

8. Conclusion

This study presents causal evidence on the relationship between lead exposure and
fertility rates in the United States between 1978 and 1988. From the airborne lead panel data
analysis over the period 1978-1988, the increase in fertility implied by the average decrease in
airborne lead is 4.5 births per 1,000 women per year, which is 6.7 percent of the mean general
fertility rate. Analysis of completed fertility using census data for 1980 and 1990 finds increases
of 0.14 children, which is 6.4 percent of the mean completed fertility.
48

For comparison, EPA estimated nationwide ex-ante social costs of reducing lead in gasoline of approximately
$1.2 billion (2013 USD) for 1988 in their cost-benefit analysis (EPA 1985). They explain that their “estimates of
these costs are based on estimates of changes in the costs of manufacturing gasoline (and other petroleum products).
In the long run in a competitive market, the change in manufacturing costs is likely to be fully reflected in changes
in the amounts paid by consumers. In the short run, however, the total amount paid by consumers may be less than
or greater than the change in manufacturing costs, depending on supply and demand elasticities and other factors.”
(EPA 1985, p. II-2)

34

Although leaded automobile gasoline was banned in the U.S. in 1996, our findings are
still relevant today. Our estimates for lead in topsoil suggest that deposition in soil remains a
public health issue. Moreover, gasoline for small aircraft is still leaded. Zahran et al. (2017)
provides evidence that leaded gasoline, which is still not regulated by the U.S. EPA but used in a
large fraction of piston-engine aircraft, may affect millions of people living close to large and
small airports. Moreover, many high and medium income countries have significant levels of
lead in topsoil. So lead exposure may continue to impair fertility today. This is a concern,
because fertility has implications for economic activity, aging populations, and society more
broadly.

Panel A. Emission by Source: 1970-2011

Panel B. Emission by Source: 1990-2011

Notes: Data are taken from the U.S. EPA, 2014. Changes reported for 1970-2011 include both emissions changes
and methods changes. While the trends displayed in the figure are generally representative, actual changes from year
to year could have been larger or smaller than those reported here.

Figure 2 – Number of Airborne Lead Monitors Over Time

Notes: This figure shows the number of EPA airborne lead monitors over the period 1975-1996. “Study period” is
the time period used in the main analysis of the effect of airborne lead exposure on fertility: 1978-1988.

Figure 3 – Airborne Lead and General Fertility Rate Over Time
Panel A. Airborne Lead, µg/m3

Panel B. General Fertility Rate

Notes: Panel A. shows the concentration of lead in air over time during the study period 1978-1988. Lead in air is
weighted by number of women of childbearing age (15 to 44 years). Panel B shows the general fertility rate during
the study period 1978-1988 (weighted by number of women of childbearing age). General fertility rate is defined as
total number of births per 1,000 females 15-44 years old, measured nine months in the future. The two vertical lines
show the time of the two policies we are using in our analysis: October 1979, when refineries were required to
produce a quarterly average of no more than 0.8 grams per gallon (gpg) among total gasoline output, and July 1985,
when the standards were tightened to 0.5 grams per leaded gallon (gplg).

Figure 4 – Routes of the Recommended Interregional Highway System: “1944 Plan”

Notes: This figure shows the 1944 Interstate Highway System Plan Map (Michaels 2008). In 1941, President
Roosevelt appointed a National Interregional Highway Committee to design a interregional highway system
addressing three policy goals (Michaels, 2008): (i) to improve the connection between major metropolitan areas in
the U.S., (ii) to serve U.S. national defense, and (iii) to connect with major routes in Canada and Mexico. Congress
acted on these recommendations in the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944. In our analysis, we refer to the plan
recommended by that committee as the “1944 plan”.

Notes: Panel A shows airborne lead levels over time in counties with and without highway as planned in the 1944
Interstate Highway System Map during the study period 1978-1988. The series are weighted by number of women
of childbearing age (15 to 44 years). Panel B shows the general fertility rate over time in counties with and without
highway as planned in the 1944 Interstate Highway System Map during the study period 1978-1988. General
fertility rate is defined as total number of births per 1,000 females 15-44 years old, measured nine months in the
future. The series are weighted by number of women of childbearing age. The two vertical lines show the time of the
two policies we are using in our analysis: October 1979, when refineries were required to produce a quarterly

were tightened to 0.5 grams per leaded gallon (gplg).

Panel A. Fertility Rates and Number of Births: Actual vs. Predicted if Lead was kept at the 1978 Level

Panel B. Difference in General Fertility Rates and Number of Births

Notes: This figure displays the results of the counterfactual analysis. Panel A shows the results for the general
fertility rate and number of births if airborne lead was kept at the average 1978 level, and the general fertility rate
and number of births using actual (realized) airborne lead data. General fertility rate is defined as total number of
births per 1,000 females 15-44 years old, measured nine months in the future. Panel B presents the difference
between the two curves from Panel A. Specifically, the left figure depicts the extra fertility rate due to the decline in
airborne lead concentration relative to the fertility rate if airborne lead was kept at the 1978 level. The right figure in
Panel B presents the extra number of births.

Notes: This table presents the OLS, first stage, and IV estimates using instruments discussed in the identification
section for completed fertility - the number of children a woman has ever had, excluding stillbirths. The sample is
restricted to the female population 35-44 years old from the Census 1980 and 1990. "All" includes every woman
in that age range, "Stayers" includes only women who were living in the same county for at least five years, and
were living in their state of birth, "Overlap Counties" refers to the 170 counties that matched among the 337
counties used for the analysis of the effects of airborne lead on the general fertility rate over the period 19781988, and "Identifiable Counties" refers to all 252 (170 + 82) counties in the IPUMS with FIPS available counties with 100,000 population or more. Airborne lead is the county-level average of all EPA lead monitor
readings for the years 1978-1984 (for Census year 1980), and 1985-1990 (for Census year 1990). HWPlan1944 x
1(Year=1990) is an interaction between the indicator for whether a county was recommended to receive a
highway as part of the 1944 Interstate Highway System Map, and an indicator for the year 1990, when the phasedown of lead in gasoline, and the NAAQS for particulate matter had already been effective. Geographical
variables are average temperature, degree days below 10C, degree days above 29C, precipitation, their squares,
and year by latitude and year by longitude fixed effects. Mother and Household Characteristics are education
attainment (12 categories), age (10 age indicators, one for each age), marital status (6 categories), race (9 groups),
hispanic origin (6 categories), poverty status, socioeconomic index, and household income and its square.
Regressions are weighted by person weight provided by the Census Bureau. Standard errors are clustered at the
county level and are in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent
levels, respectively.

Notes: This table presents the first stage relationship between the instruments and lead in topsoil. The dependent
variable in all columns is an indicator variable for whether the topsoil lead concentration is above the national
median. The independent variable of interest is the HW Plan 1944, a dummy variable for whether a county was
supposed to get a highway based on the 1944 Interstate Highway System Map. Climate Variables are temperature
and precipitation, as well as number of heating and cooling degree days in a particular county. Demographic
Variables are the following: share of white people, percent of foreign people, share of people with completed high
school, share of people with completed college, share of people in different age groups: below 5, 5-9, 10-14, 1519, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, and 60-64 years old. Economics variables are
income, employment, percent of people below the poverty level. Housing Controls include share of houses build
before 1939, between 1940 and 1949, between 1950 and 1959, between 1960 and 1969, between 1970 and 1979,

Notes: This table shows the OLS and IV cross sectional effects of lead in topsoil on fertility for 2005. GRF
(General Fertility Rate) is the number of children born in per 1,000 female population ages 15-44. Topsoil Lead is
an indicator variable for whether the topsoil lead concentration is above the national median. Climate Variables
are temperature and precipitation and their squares, as well as number of heating and cooling degree days in a
particular county. Demographic Variables are the following: share of white people, percent of foreign people,
share of people with completed high school, share of people with completed college, share of people in different
age groups: below 5, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, and 60-64 years
old. Economics variables are income, employment, percent of people below the poverty level. Housing Controls
include share of houses build before 1939, between 1940 and 1949, between 1950 and 1959, between 1960 and
1969, between 1970 and 1979, between 1980 and 1989, between 1990 and 1999, between 2000 and 2004, number
of total houses build, medium number of rooms in 2005-2009 per house. Other controls include share of
Democratic votes and nonattainment status for any EPA criteria pollutant. Regressions are weighted by number of
females 15-44 years old. Standard errors are clustered at the state level and are in parentheses. ***, **, and *
indicate statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels, respectively.

Notes: This table presents the back of the envelope benefit-cost calculations based on the
estimated effects of lead exposure on fertility. All amounts are expressed in 2013 USD. Column
1 calculates the benefits based on IV estimates, column 2 presents the estimates based on OLS,
and column 3 reports the difference between the two. Panel A shows the monetized benefits of
cleaner air. In particular, it computes the benefits of having more children as a result of the
airborne lead reduction compared to the airborne lead level in 1978. Benefits are total benefits
in all counties in 1988. Alternatively, in the last two rows, it reports the benefits of having more
children based on the completed fertility results. Costs in the Panel A are the average annual
costs in all counties in the sample. Costs are estimated based on the airborne lead reduction due
to the introduction of unleaded gasoline, and are computed using the difference in prices
between leaded and unleaded gasoline in 1988 (10 cents in 2013 USD), share of unleaded
gasoline used in 1988 (80 percent), the amount of gasoline used based on the average MPG of
the car fleet in 1988, and vehicle miles traveled in 1988. Panel B presents the estimates of
benefits and costs using the 2000 cross sectional data on lead in soil. Benefits are calculated
based on the assumption of bringing the lead concentrations from above the median to below
the median. Beak even costs are calculated based on the costs of cleaning the soil from lead
used in the superfund program in the East West Oakland, CA Site (West Oakland Residential
Lead Assessment, EPA 2010). The estimates of costs assume an average yard size of 15,300
square feet per site with cleaning at 8-9 inches depth. Costs of cleaning is $38,000 in 2013 USD
per residential lot.

Notes: This figure plots annual general fertility rates for counties with and without highway as planned in the 1944
Interstate Highway System Map (HWPlan1944) during the period 1972-1998. General fertility rate is defined as
total number of births per 1,000 females 15-44 years old. The series are weighted by number of women of
childbearing age (15 to 44 years). The two short-dashed vertical lines indicate the period of our study – 1978-1988.

Figure A1.5 – Trends in Annual Airborne Lead Concentration for 1972-1998

Notes: This figure plots annual airborne lead concentration for counties with and without highway as planned in the
1944 Interstate Highway System Map (HWPlan1944) during the period 1972-1998. The data come from the EPA
network of monitoring stations, and were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.

year divided by female population ages 15-45 in that year. Climate Variables are temperature and
precipitation and their squares, as well as number of heating and cooling degree days in a particular
county. Demographic Variables are following: share of white people, percent of foreign people, share of
people with completed high school, share of people with completed college, share of people in different
age groups: below 5, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64.
Economics variables are income, employment, percent of people below the poverty level. Housing
Controls include share of houses build before 1939, between 1940 and 1949, between 1950 and 1959,
between 1960 and 1969, between 1970 and 1979, between 1980 and 1989, between 1990 and 1999,
between 2000 and 2004, number of total houses build, medium number of rooms in 2005-2009 per
house. Other controls include share of Democratic votes and nonattainment status for any EPA criteria
pollutant. Regressions are weighted by number of females 15-44 years old. Standard errors are clustered
at the state level and are in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10

Notes: This table shows the IV cross sectional effects of lead in topsoil on
fertility separately for 2004, 2005 (our main results), and 2006. GFR (General
Fertility Rate) is the number of children born in each specific year divided by
female population ages 15-45 in that year. Climate Variables are temperature and
precipitation and their squares, as well as number of heating and cooling degree
days in a particular county. Demographic Variables are following: share of white
people, percent of foreign people, share of people with completed high school,
share of people with completed college, share of people in different age groups:
below 5, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 5559, 60-64. Economics variables are income, employment, percent of people
below the poverty level. Housing Controls include share of houses build before
1939, between 1940 and 1949, between 1950 and 1959, between 1960 and 1969,
between 1970 and 1979, between 1980 and 1989, between 1990 and 1999,
between 2000 and 2004, number of total houses build, medium number of rooms
in 2005-2009 per house. Other controls include share of Democratic votes and
nonattainment status for any EPA criteria pollutant. Regressions are weighted by
number of females 15-44 years old. Standard errors are clustered at the state level
and are in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1, 5,
and 10 percent levels, respectively.

Notes: This table shows the IV cross sectional effects of lead in topsoil on fertility for 2005.
Columns 1 repeats the estimates from Table 8 specifications 10. Column 2 presents the effect
of lead in the Eastern vs Western counties (counties to the east or to the west from the 100th
meridian). Column 3 presents the effect of lead in high vs low lead states. GRF (General
Fertility Rate) is the number of children born in per 1,000 female population ages 15-44.
Topsoil Lead is an indicator variable for whether the topsoil lead concentration is above the
national median. Climate Variables are temperature and precipitation and their squares, as well
as number of heating and cooling degree days in a particular county. Demographic Variables

Notes: This table presents the OLS, first stage, and IV estimates using the instrument discussed in the
identification section for completed fertility - the number of children a woman has ever had, excluding stillbirths,
with weighted average of 1.89 in the sample. The sample is restricted to the female population 35-44 years old
from the Current Population Survey (CPS) - Fertility Supplement for June 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, and
2010. The number of observations in the table refers to the number of women whose county of residence matched
the counties used for the the analysis of the effects of topsoil lead on the general fertility rate in 2005. Those were
the 233 counties with FIPS available in the IPUMS-CPS - counties with 100,000 population or more. "Topsoil
Lead" is an indicator variable for whether the topsoil lead concentration is above the national median. The
instrument "HWPlan1944" is a dummy variable for whether a county was supposed to receive a highway based
on the 1944 Interstate Highway System Plan. Geographical variables are average temperature, degree days below
10C, degree days above 29C, precipitation, and county-centroid latitude and longitude. Mother and Household
Characteristics are indicators for education attainment (16 categories), age (10 age indicators, one for each age),
marital status (7 categories), race (29 groups), hispanic origin (17 categories), and household income (originally
coded into 63 categories).County Characteristics are the same as in the topsoil analysis, as listed in previous
tables. Regressions are weighted by person weight provided by the CPS Fertility Supplement. Standard errors are
clustered at the state level and are in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10
percent levels, respectively.

Note: This table presents the effects of the instrumental variables used in the main time-series
analysis on population characteristics of counties: age, measured as the average age of mothers in
a given county, education, measured as the average educational attainment (in years) of mothers,
average marital status of mothers and the skin color of children. Economic Variables are log of
county total employment and log of county per capita income. Climate variables are temperature,
precipitation, their squares, and year by latitude and year by longitude fixed effects. Mother and
Child Characteristics are indicator for whether the birth was given at a hospital, dummy for
whether the physician was present, dummy for twin births, dummy for previous dead child,
dummy for previous child alive, controls for the start of prenatal care. Regressions are weighted
by number of females 15-44 years old. Standard errors are clustered at the county level and are in
parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels,
