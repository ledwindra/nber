    "abstract": "\n\nPublic health advocates warn that the rapid growth of legal markets for electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) may generate a \u201cgateway\u201d to marijuana and harder drug consumption, particularly among teenagers. This study explores the effects of ENDS taxes on substance use. We find that a one-dollar increase in ENDS taxes (2023$) is associated with a 1.0 to 1.5 percentage point decline in teen marijuana use and in co-use of ENDS and marijuana. This result is consistent with e-cigarettes and marijuana being economic complements. We also find that youth responses to ENDS taxes, in terms of their ENDS use and spillovers into marijuana use, appear to moderate over the longer term. We find no evidence that ENDS taxes affect drug treatment admissions or consumption of illicit drugs other than marijuana such as cocaine, methamphetamine, or opioids.\n\n",

Sabia\n\nDr. Sabia acknowledges research support for this work from the Center for Health Economics & Policy Studies (CHEPS) at San Diego State University (SDSU), which has received grants from the Charles Koch Foundation. On March 29, 2024, the Foundation for a Smoke Free World (FSFW) awarded a research grant to the SDSU Research Foundation under which Sabia (PI) and collaborators will study the intended and unintended effects of public policies that restrict access to electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) products. As of October 2023, the FSFW has severed legal ties with Philip Morris International (PMI) and no longer accepts funding from PMI. The current draft of the working paper submitted to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) on April 3, 2024 was not supported by the above-described grant.\n\n\n"
