What Explains Differences in Smoking, Drinking and Other Health-Related Behaviors?
David Cutler and Edward Glaeser
NBER Working Paper No. 11100
February 2005
JEL No. I2
ABSTRACT
We explore economic model of health behaviors. While the standard economic model of health as
an investment is generally supported empirically, the ability of this model to explain heterogeneity
across individuals is extremely limited. Most prominently, the correlation of different health
behaviors across people is virtually zero, suggest that standard factors such as variation in discount
rates or the value of life are not the drivers of behavior. We focus instead on two other factors:
genetics; and behavioral-specific situational factors. The first factor is empirically important, and we
suspect the second is as well.

Unhealthy behaviors are a major part of the health profile in the United States and
other developed countries. A famous article by J. Michael McGinnis, and William H.
Foege (1993) estimated that half of all deaths in the United States are due to unhealthy
behaviors, most importantly tobacco use, poor diet and exercise, and excessive alcohol
consumption. Even this excludes many health-harming behaviors such as passing up
recommended screening tests, discontinuing medication usage, and not following up on
physician referrals. Why do people not do the right thing for their health?
The prevailing economic paradigm for understanding these forms of behavior is
that health behaviors are investments, where foregone current pleasure leads to
improvements in future well-being (Michael Grossman, 1972).

As such, variations in

health behaviors will be explained by differences in discount rates or the value of life.
If this theory is right, health behaviors will differ across people, but for a given
person, behaviors will be highly correlated: those who value their health highly and care
sufficiently about the future will have much better behaviors than those who do not.
Table 1 shows the correlation of five different health measures, drawn from the 1990
National Health Interview Survey (NHIS): current smoking; heavy drinking (3 or more
drinks per day); being obese (BMI 30); using hypertension medication when
recommended; and (for women) receiving a mammogram in the past 3 years. In each
case, we sample the population aged 45 and older, a group where the health consequences
of poor behavior should be salient. The correlations across behaviors are surprisingly
low. Smoking and drinking exhibit the largest correlation, but this is only 16 percent.1
Most correlations are below 10 percent.

1

The low correlation is not an artifact of this data set or time period. Appendix
Table 1 shows analysis of data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey in
2002. This survey includes measures of smoking, drinking, obesity, use of a seatbelt,
receipt of a flu shot in the past year, and screening for colorectal, breast, cervical, and
prostate cancer. Preventive service receipt is more correlated than is dietary behavior,
with roughly 20 percent correlations among these activities. But even 20 percent is not
very high, and preventive service use is virtually unrelated to dietary behavior. The
individual model of behavior is thus quantitatively not very important.
Even if health behaviors differ generally, individuals might at some point in their
lives experience shocks to their discount rates, incomes, or beliefs about the future that
will result in large behavioral changes. Thus, year to year changes in health behaviors
could be more highly correlated than behavior at any point in time.

We examine this

proposition using data from the Health and Retirement Study, a sample of nearly 10,000
people nearing retirement age. There are six waves of data available to this point.
Table 2 shows correlations of changes in behavior. In each case, the sample is
people who were not maximizing their health beforehand: smoking, drinking heavily,
being overweight, or not exercising. Even behavioral changes are not highly correlated;
the largest correlation in the table is less than .1.

The investment model is thus

incomplete along this dimension as well.
What, then, are the alternatives? There are three possibilities: health behaviors
differ because of differing information; because of genetic differences; and because of
situational factors that are specific to the person and behavior. In the remainder of the
paper, we examine these different factors.

2

I.

Framework
To understand our analysis, we begin with a simple two-period model of

individual choices, where individual i chooses health related actions (denoted a j for
action j) to maximize expected discounted lifetime utility:

π~ ij a j β iVi ,

2

(b ij a j − .5a j ) + π −

W =
j

(1)

j

where b ij reflects the individual-specific current return to the action (net of price),

π~ ij a j

π−

is the probability of survival to the next period, and π~ ij is the self-

j

perceived effect of action j on the survival probability.

β i is the individual-specific

discount rate, and Vi is the value to surviving into the next period. The first order
condition for action j is: a j = b ij − π~ ij β iVi .
We assume that b ij = b i + b j +ε ji , where b i is the individual tendency to engage
in these activities, b j is the average preference for this activity in society, and ε
activity and person-specific idiosyncratic taste. We normalize b i and ε

i
j

i
j

is an

to mean zero

and assume they are independent of each other and b j . Similarly, π~ ij = π j + µ ij where

π j represents the society-wide average belief (which may or may not be correct) and µ ij
is an idiosyncratic individual factor with mean zero and no correlation with the other
variables. β V is the expectation of β iVi .
The variance of the action across individuals is given by:

3

(

)

Var (a j ) = π jVar (β iVi ) + Var (β iVi ) + β V Var ( µ ij ) + Var (b i + ε ij )
2

2

(2)

The first term is the heterogeneity related to discount rates or the value of life. The
second term relates to the heterogeneity of beliefs about the impact of action j: when
people view the behavior in question differentially, this will influence the observed
variability in outcomes. The third term reflects heterogeneity in preferences, some of
which are common across behaviors and others of which are idiosyncratic.
The correlation across people between observed actions j and k is
corr (a j , a k ) = (π j π k Var (β iVi ) + var(b i ))

stddev(a j ) stddev(a k ) .

The

numerator

consists of variability in standard investment effects (the first term) and variability in
individual preferences (the second term).
The small correlation we observe between different behaviors implies that neither
variability in standard investment factors nor in cross-behavior personal preferences is
that large – the two together do not top 10 percent of total variability. Understanding the
heterogeneity in behaviors requires us instead to understand the variability in perceived
2

health consequences, β V Var ( µ ij ) , and tastes, Var (ε ij ) .
Since many of our health outcomes are discrete, rather than continuous, we extend
the model to address the continuous outcomes. We assume that there is remains a latent
variable a j , and to simplify the discussion, we assume that this latent variable equals

ε ij − π j β iVi , the idiosyncratic taste for the variable minus the expected health costs.
Individuals undertake the discrete action if and only if a j is positive. Our goal is to
2

2

(

)

assess π jVar ( β iVi ) / π j Var ( β iVi ) + Var (ε ij ) , that share of the variance that is accounted
for by heterogeneity in investment factors.

4

To make progress, some assumption about the distribution of the factors is
necessary. For simplicity, we assume that both variables are uniform, and we normalize
so that β iVi is uniformly distributed across the population on the interval [0, 1]. The

[

variable ε ij is assumed to be uniformly distributed on the interval θ j − .5e j , θ j + .5e j

.

For discrete outcome k, we similarly assume a k = ε ki − π k β iVi , where ε ki is distributed
uniformly on the interval [θ k − .5ek , θ k + .5ek ] . Again, the action is undertaken if and
only if a k

is positive.

Finally, we assume the e j > 2Max θ j , π j − θ j

the estimated correlation coefficients. The estimates of

cluster around .15.

Again, these figures are low and suggest that the bulk of heterogeneity in behaviors
cannot be explained by variation in the common investment-related characteristics.

II.

Health Beliefs and Health Behaviors

To examine the importance of differing health beliefs, we relate the behaviors
described above to survey response about what people believe are the consequences of
these actions. The 1990 NHIS asks a number of questions about the potential adverse
effects of different behaviors. A typical question is of the form: “Does cigarette smoking
increase the chance of developing lung cancer?,” with possible responses of: definitely
increases; probably increases; probably does not increase; and definitely does not
increase.

We demarcate people by whether they believe the behavior in question

definitely increases the risk or not.2 For smoking, questions are asked about the link to
cardiovascular disease, cancer, and respiratory problems. Questions are also asked about
the harmful effects of alcohol, being overweight, and having high blood pressure, but not
about failure to receive a mammogram.

6

In each case, the vast majority of people believe that these behaviors are harmful.
For example, 74 percent of people respond that cigarette smoking is definitely related to
cardiovascular disease, 86 percent believe it is definitely related to cancer, and 85 percent
believe it is definitely related to respiratory problems. For alcohol use, being overweight,
and having hypertension, the corresponding figures are 87 percent, 75 percent, and 69
percent. Beliefs are also generally related to demographics, as we would expect. Better
educated and higher income people are more likely to believe that most of the behaviors
are harmful to health. Racial effects are not very big.
That is not to say that the belief measures are without problems. Clearly, they
measure true belief with error. More importantly, these beliefs may rationalize, rather
than cause behavior. But rationalization would tend to overstate the importance of beliefs.
Table 3 shows the relation between beliefs, socioeconomic factors, and health
behaviors.3 For each of the behaviors described above, the first rows report the effect of
education and income on engaging in the behavior (also included in the regressions, but
not reported, are five year age-sex groups, dummy variables for blacks, other races, and
Hispanics, and a dummy variable for being married).
People who invest more in education generally invest more in health as well;
there is a significant education effect in most regressions. Indeed, the education effect is
large; behaviors differ by as much as 10 percentage points between college graduates and
high school dropouts. Income is also generally associated with better health. However,
the explanatory power of these socioeconomic factors is low.

The R2’s from

socioeconomic factors alone are reported in the bottom of the table4 and range from 2
percent for using hypertension medication to 9 percent for receiving a mammogram on

7

the recommended schedule. These results confirm the low correlations noted in table 1.
Once again, these results are not unique to the data or specific behaviors indicated.
Appendix table 2 shows that the same low R2 for socioeconomic factors is found in the
BRFSS data as well.
The next rows report the coefficients on beliefs.

Beliefs are almost always

correlated with behavior in the expected way. People who think that smoking or drinking
poses a greater risk are unsurprisingly less likely to smoke or drink. The magnitude of
these effects ranges up to 15 percentage points for smoking, but is much weaker for the
other variables. But again, the ability of these variables to explain individual variation is
small. Including belief variables in the regressions increases the R2 by only 5 percent in
the case of smoking, and even less for the other behaviors. Even recognizing that beliefs
are measured with error, the very low explanatory power and possibility for ex post
rationalization makes it hard to accept that belief heterogeneity explains differences in
individual behaviors.

IV.

The Individual vs. the Situation

There are two primary rivals to the economic view of health investments: the
genetic view that human heterogeneity is driven primarily by genetic differences, and the
psychological view that human choices are driven primarily by randomly-encountered
situational differences – a chance encounter with a particular peer group, perhaps, or a
random health shock that affects that individual and not others.
Our first attempt to differentiate between these behaviors is to estimate the
importance of fixed individual effects in different forms of health behaviors. This is an

8

upper bound on the importance of genetics or other behavior-specific factors. To do this,
we use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We gauge the importance of
individual effects using a random effects regression model, controlling in the model for
aggregate year effects.5
The first column of Table 4 lists the partial-R2 of the individual effects. The R2
ranges from 38 percent for vigorous exercise, to nearly 90 percent for body mass index.
Smoking shows a high degree of permanence (79 percent R2) and drinking less (51
percent R2). The high R2’s for smoking and obesity can be explained by many different
theories. Genetics might be important, but so too might be addiction (rational or myopic)
or peer effects with relatively stable peer groups.
We consider first the potential importance of neighborhoods. Neighborhoods
might matter for health behaviors because of peer effects, or because of correlated shocks
such as high or low tax rates on cigarettes. To gauge the importance of neighborhood
effects, we have estimated the added R2 in table 3 that comes from including geographic
controls at the Primary Sampling Unit (roughly MSA) level. Addition of the geographic
controls raises the R2 by two to seven percent.6 The relatively modest explanatory power
of area effects suggests that these gross measures of situation are not where the bulk of
the situational variation results from.
We can say more about the impact of genetics on health behaviors.

The

Minnesota Twin Registry7 has data on many health behaviors among all twins born in
Minnesota between 1936 and 1955, nearly 4,000 individuals in total. Following the
standard literature on heritability, we compare the correlation of behavior between

9

monozygotic (identical) and dizygotic (fraternal) twins. The genetic contribution to any
behavior is twice the difference between the correlation in these groups.
The second column of Table 4 reports the genetic contribution to variability in
health behaviors. The highest heritability estimate is for body mass index – 72 percent of
the variation across people in body mass is estimated to be the result of purely genetic
factors. The heritability for other variables is smaller: 26 percent for exercise, 30 percent
for smoking and 38 percent for heavy drinking. Comparing columns 1 and 2 of table 4,
about one-half of the individual variation in these behaviors results from a genetic
predisposition to engage in them.
Our bottom line estimate is that variation in health behaviors results from two
primary factors: genetics, and behavior-specific situational influences. We have not to
date identified what the relevant situational influences are, but that is clearly a high
priority for future research.

One might worry that smoking is metabolically associated with lower weight.

We have

experimented with adding up to 10 pounds to the weight of smokers, a rough estimate of weight
gain after smoking cessation. That does not materially affect the correlations reported in Table 1.
2

Virtually everyone believes these behaviors are at least somewhat related to poor outcomes. In

many cases, multiple questions are asked. We denote a person as believing the activity is
definitely bad if they report it definitely causes at least one outcome.
3

Area-level dummy variables are also included in the regressions, as discussed below.

4

The incremental R2’s are calculated sequentially. The R2 for socioeconomics is based on a

regression with those variables only; the R2 for beliefs is the incremental explanatory power from
adding beliefs to the model with SES, and similarly for geography.
5

We use random effects rather than fixed effects because of the short panel.

6

A similar finding is true in the BRFSS data.
