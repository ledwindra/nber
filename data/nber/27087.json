    "abstract": "\n\nWe recover valuations of time using detailed data from a large ride-hail platform, where drivers bid on trips and consumers choose between a set of rides with different prices and wait times. Leveraging a consumer panel, we estimate demand as a function of both prices and wait times and use the resulting estimates to recover heterogeneity in the value of time across consumers. We study the welfare implications of personalized pricing and its effect on the platform, drivers, and consumers. Taking into account drivers\u2019 optimal reaction to the platform\u2019s pricing policy, personalized pricing lowers consumer surplus by 2.5% and increases overall surplus by 5.2%. Like the platform, drivers benefit from personalized pricing. ETA-based pricing\u2013 where different prices are set for various wait times and where extensive use of consumer data is not required\u2013can capture a significant portion of the profits garnered from personalized pricing, while simultaneously benefiting consumers.\n\n",
