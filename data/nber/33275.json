    "abstract": "\n\nTransition risk \u2013 the financial stability risk related with decarbonization \u2013 is a major source of concern. The literature has so far only studied transition risk caused by carbon tax shocks. This paper explores other potential sources of transition risk: two other policy sources \u2013 subsidies to abatement or to green producers \u2013 and two preference-based sources \u2013 a shock to consumer preferences and a shock to investor preferences. We develop an environmental dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model that includes a frictional financial sector, and we consider macroprudential policy responses to transition risks. These different shocks have different effects on the possibility of transition risk and lead to different macroprudential policy implications.\n\n",
