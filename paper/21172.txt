Financial Flows and the International Monetary System
Evgenia Passari and Hélène Rey
NBER Working Paper No. 21172
May 2015
JEL No. E5,F3
ABSTRACT
We review the findings of the literature on the benefits of international financial flows and find that
they are quantitatively elusive. We then present evidence on the existence of a global cycle in gross
cross border flows, asset prices and leverage and discuss its impact on monetary policy autonomy
across different exchange rate regimes. We focus in particular on the effect of US monetary policy
shocks on the UK's financial conditions.

Keynes in the ’Economic consequences of peace’ published in 1920 lauded the
benefits of international integration in trade and financial flows. He explained
how before the first world war,
...the inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his
morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth, in
such quantity as he might see fit, and reasonably expect their early
delivery upon his doorstep; he could at the same moment and by the
same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new
enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion
or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages; or he
could decide to couple the security of his fortunes with the good faith
of the townspeople of any substantial municipality in any continent
that fancy or information might recommend.
(Keynes, 1920, p.11)
After some important setbacks during the wars and the Great Depression,
financial openness seems to have resumed its long run upward trajectory. Both
emerging markets and advanced economies are increasingly holding large amounts
of assets cross border, even though the 2007 crisis has moderated the trend. A
simple and widely used measure of de facto financial integration, the sum of
cross-border financial claims and liabilities, scaled by annual GDP has risen
from about 70% in 1980 to 440% in 2007 for advanced economies, and from
about 35% to 70% for emerging markets during the same period (see Lane
(2012)). The gross external assets and liabilities of the UK were 488% and
507% of annual output respectively in 2010.1
The menu of assets exchanged across borders has also become broader with
derivatives and asset backed mortgage securities becoming internationally traded.
It is increasingly important to look at the entire external balance sheet of countries (and not only at net positions) to understand the financial strength and
vulnerabilities of countries. As discussed in Gourinchas and Rey (2014), the external assets of the United States for example are tilted towards “risky assets”,
equity and FDI which constitute about 49% of total assets between 1970 and
2010, while external US liabilities consist mostly of “safer assets” such as debt
and bank credit. Such heterogeneity in the composition of the balance sheets
opens the door to large valuation effects and potentially large wealth transfers
across countries (see Gourinchas and Rey 2007 and Gourinchas, Rey and Truempler (2012) who estimate valuation changes during the 2008 crisis). Gourinchas,
Rey and Govillot (2010) provide a theoretical model of these transfers and show
that the US plays the role of the world insurer during global crises.
The scope for international capital flows to provide welfare gains or losses
has therefore increased considerably in recent decades. The academic literature
has attempted to measure gains to financial integration mainly in two ways:
1 Lane and Milesi Ferretti (2007) updated. We report external assets and liabilities excluding financial derivatives.

by testing for growth effects and better risk sharing following financial account
opening using either panel data or event studies and by calibrating standard
international macroeconomic models and computing gains when going from autarky to financially integrated markets. Perhaps surprisingly, both streams of
literature have so far failed to deliver clear cut results supporting large gains to
financial integration. In the international risk sharing literature, there is still
a lively debate regarding the gains that can be achieved by diversification of
the portfolios (Obstfeld (2009), Van Wincoop (1994,1999), Lewis (1999, 2000),
Coeurdacier and Rey (2013), Lewis and Liu(2014)). In the allocative efficiency
literature based on the neoclassical growth model, gains have been found to be
relatively small (Gourinchas and Jeanne (2006) and Coeurdacier et al. (2014))
though Hoxha et al. (2013) find larger gains if capital goods are imperfect substitutes. Recent surveys of the empirical literature such as Jeanne et al. (2012)
tend to conclude that there is little support in the data for large gains from
financial integration.
On the other hand, some costs to integration, due in particular to monetary policy spillovers have become more apparent with the recent crisis. The
international finance literature has often used the framework of the Mundellian “trilemma”: in a financially integrated world, fixed exchange rates export
the monetary policy of the base country to the periphery. The corollary is
that if there are free capital flows, it is possible to have independent monetary
policies only by having the exchange rate float; and conversely, that floating
exchange rates enable monetary policy independence (see e.g. Obstfeld and
Taylor (2004)). But does the current scale of financial integration put even this
into question? Are the monetary conditions of the main world financing centres, in particular the United States, setting the tone globally, regardless of the
exchange-rate regime of countries?
In the second section of the paper we discuss the sources of potential gains
from financial integration and will assess their magnitude in the context of the
textbook neoclassical growth model. In the third part, we discuss the costs of
financial integration in the form of loss of monetary policy autonomy. We show
the existence of a global financial cycle and discuss its characteristics. In a fourth
part, we then investigate in more details whether the exchange rate regime alters
the transmission of financing conditions and monetary policy shocks. In the last
part we analyse the effect of US monetary policy on the global financial cycle
and explore empirically whether a flexible exchange rate regime (the one of the
United Kingdom) insulates countries from US monetary policy shocks.

Welfare benefits of financial capital flows

The welfare benefits of financial integration is one of the long standing issues
in international finance. The neoclassical growth model is behind many of our
economic intuitions regarding why the free flow of capital could be beneficial.
Within this model, financial integration brings improvements in allocative efficiency as capital flows to places with the highest marginal product, i.e. capital

2

scarce economies. As explained in Gourinchas and Rey (2014),2 those countries
are characterised with a high autarky rate of interest compared to the world
interest rate. Emerging markets, which tend to be more capital scarce than
mature OECD economies, should hence benefit from financial integration as
imported capital enables them to consume and invest at a faster pace than if
they had remained in financial autarky.
It is only recently (see Gourinchas and Jeanne (2006)) that the welfare gains
of going from autarky to a world where a riskless bond can be traded internationally have been evaluated quantitatively in the textbook deterministic neoclassical growth model with one good. Interestingly, those welfare gains have
been found to be small: they are worth a few tenths of a % of permanent consumption for a small open economy even if it starts with a relatively high level
of capital scarcity (calibrated to match the actual capital scarcity of emerging markets). The reason is that financial integration enables an economy to
speed up its transition towards its steady-state capital stock but that does not
bring large welfare gains as the distortion induced by a lack of capital mobility
is transitory: the country would have reached its steady-state level of capital
regardless of financial openness, albeit at a slower speed. In this framework,
only very capital-scarce countries could possibly experience significant gains to
financial integration.
Figure 1, taken from the analysis of Coeurdacier et al. (2014), illustrates
the time paths of consumption and capital for an emerging market which is
capital scarce (hence far away from its steady state) and a developed economy
whose capital stock is already at its steady state. Otherwise the environment is
fully symmetric, factor markets are competitive, labour is in fixed supply and
there is no uncertainty. Dotted lines denote the autarky states while continuous
lines denote the paths after financial integration (a riskless bond can be traded
internationally). Time is measured in years on the horizontal axis. The economy
is a deterministic two-country neo classical growth model (for details on the
model and calibration and a stochastic version see Coeurdacier et al. (2014)).
The upper right panel shows that the time path of capital accumulation for the
emerging market, when there is financial integration, is above the autarky path
in the transition period before it reaches its steady state level. The steady state
level of capital is the same under financial integration and under autarky.3 The
gains to financial integration are thus limited to the area between the two curves
and turn out to be quantitatively quite small. The developed country gains from
financial integration, but also quantitatively in a very small way. As shown in
the lower right panel, it starts by exporting capital to the emerging market (thus
accumulating net claims on the emerging markets). Hence the consumption of
the emerging market (upper left panel) is at first above its autarky level but then
beneath it as it needs to repay its liabilities to the mature economy. The mirror
image is true for the advanced economy which benefits in the long run from
a higher consumption level than under autarky (lower left panel). The world

analysed in Coeurdacier et al. (2014), this is no longer true in a stochastic world with
many interesting consequences.

interest rate establishes itself in between the two autarky rates of interest.
When calibrated to standard values used in the literature, the welfare gains
are found to be small, of the order of a few tenths of a % of permanent consumption. They are even smaller than in the Gourinchas and Jeanne (2006) small
open economy paper as a general equilibrium effect via movements in the world
rate tends to dampen welfare gains: the emerging market welfare is negatively
affected by the world interest rate going up following integration, as it is a net
debtor to the rest of the world.
The model described here however is deterministic (as in Gourinchas and
Jeanne (2006)) and cannot therefore be used to analyse the welfare gains linked
to international risk sharing. Financial integration enables better risk sharing,
as long as countries idiosyncratic risks are not perfectly positively correlated.4
Coeurdacier et al. (2014) are the first ones to compute welfare gains along
the transition path in a more general neo classical growth model in a stochastic
setting, allowing for asymmetries in risk and in capital scarcity. They show that
gains from increased allocative efficiency and from risk sharing are intertwined
in interesting ways and that they can generate very rich and non monotonic
patterns of international capital flows over time. Their model can for example
generate global imbalances (capital flowing from the emerging market to the
developed economy) without any additional friction. They conclude however
that welfare gains of financial integration remain relatively small even in that
broader setting and even when they consider models with realistic risk premia.

[FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE]
There are other channels through which financial integration could be beneficial. It could have direct effects on Total Factor Productivity via financial
markets development or institutional changes. It could discipline macroeconomic policies. We still lack convincing empirical evidence on these channels
however (see the survey of Jeanne et al. (2012)), which constitutes an interesting agenda for further research. Since the large empirical literature on financial
integration is still inconclusive as well, at this stage, one can therefore summarise our view by stating that large gains from financial integration cannot be
taken for granted.

Financial Integration and the Global Financial Cycle

Some costs to financial integration, due in particular to monetary policy spillovers
have become more apparent in the run up of and during the 2007 crisis. The
4 Baxter and Crucini (1995) study the effect of different asset market structures on the
correlations of aggregate macroeconomic variables around the deterministic steady state. They
show that the persistence of TFP shocks is an important parameter.

Figure 1: Consumption and Capital for an Emerging Market and a Developed
Economy (Coeurdacier et al. (2014))
international finance literature has often used the framework of the Mundellian
“trilemma” to discuss monetary autonomy. In a world of free capital mobility, fixed exchange rates export the monetary policy of the base country to the
periphery. The corollary is that it is possible to have independent monetary
policies only by having the exchange rate float; and conversely, that floating exchange rates enable monetary policy independence (see e.g. Obstfeld and Taylor
(2004), Klein and Shambaugh (2013), Goldberg (2013)). But the current scale
of financial integration may put even this into question. Monetary conditions
of the main world financing centres, in particular the United States, may spill
over into many jurisdictions, regardless of the exchange-rate regime of countries. Indeed, the recent period of financial globalization has been characterised
by the existence of what Rey (2013) called a “Global Financial Cycle”.5 We
now present a few stylised facts that characterise the global financial cycle.
Stylised fact 1:
There is a clear pattern of co-movement of gross capital flows, of leverage of
the banking sector, of credit creation and of risky asset prices (stocks, corporate
bonds) across countries.6 This is the Global Financial Cycle. Rey (2013) shows
5 The global financial cycle is related to but is different from the national financial cycles
described by Drehmann et al. (2012), who emphasise in particular the cycles in credit and
real estate prices.

that gross inflows across geographical areas and across asset classes (credit,
portfolio debt and equity, FDI) are overwhelmingly positively correlated.
Stylised fact 2 :
Indices of market fear (such as the VIX, the VSTOXX, the VFTSE or the
VNKY,7 ) tend to co-move negatively with gross cross-border flows (see also
Forbes and Warnock (2012)). The correlations between the VIX and debt,
credit and equity flows are -0.27, -0.24 and -0.34 respectively.
Figure 2 illustrates comovement of (the opposite of) the VIX with world
aggregate gross cross border inflows of portfolio debt, equity and credit.8 As
risk aversion and volatility increase cross border transactions go down.

[FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE]

Stylised fact 3 :
Indices of market fear (such as the VIX, the VSTOXX, the VFTSE or the
VNKY) tend to co-move negatively with credit and leverage growth (see also
Bruno and Shin (2014)). The correlation between the VIX and global leverage
(broadly defined as loan-to-deposit ratio)9 is equal to -0.11. When we look at the
correlation between the VIX and leverage growth across different geographical
areas we see that the relationship is stronger (more negative) for big financial
centers such as North America (-0.34), Europe (-0.12) and Asia (-0.30) than it
is for areas such as Latin America (-0.03) and Africa (-0.03). Figure 3 presents
the joint time variations of a world measure of banking leverage and of the VIX.

[FIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE]

Both measures have been smoothed by taking quarterly averages. The degree
of comovement between the two series is evident. It confirms and generalises
the results of Adrian and Shin (2014) who find a significant negative correlation
between leverage and value at risk using banks balance sheet data. We also
find a negative correlation between the VIX and broker-dealer leverage growth
(-0.10) in line with Adrian et al. (2014) . One possible rationalization of this
negative correlation between the VIX and leverage has been provided by Borio
and Zhu (2011) and Adrian and Shin (2014) who argue that banks behave like
risk neutral value at risk investors but that historical measures of risk lead to
growth and risky asset prices, see Miranda Agrippino and Rey (2012).
7 The VIX is the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index. It is a measure
of the implied volatility of S&P 500 index options. The VSTOXX is the European equivalent,
while the VFTSE and the VNKY are the UK and the Japanese equivalents respectively.

procyclical leverage behaviour. In good times, perceived risk is low, spreads are
low, value at risk constraints are relaxed which leads to more investment and
bids up valuation of assets further. The reverse happens in bad times.
Stylised fact 4:
Risky asset prices (equities, corporate bonds) around the world are largely
driven by one global factor. This global factor is tightly negatively related
to the VIX.
[FIGURE 4 ABOUT HERE]
The behaviour of prices of risky assets around the globe is very striking.
One might think that prices of equities and corporate bonds reflect to a large
extent continent specific, sector specific, country specific and company specific
factors. But, as shown by Miranda Agrippino and Rey (2012) using a large cross
section of 858 risky asset prices distributed on the five continents, an important

VIX

World Bank Leverage Growth

Figure 3: Joint Time Variations of a World Measure of Loan-to-Deposit Ratio
and the VIX, 1990-2012
part of the variance of risky returns (25%) is explained by one single global
factor. This result is remarkable given the size and the heterogeneity of the set
of returns. Figure 4 presents the time variation of the single global factor that
explains a large part of the variance of the cross section. It increases from the
early 1990s until mid 1998, the time of the Russian crisis. From the beginning
of 2003, the index increases rapidly until the beginning of the third quarter of
2007. This coincides with the increased vulnerability of the financial markets
worldwide and the growing alarms of market participants on the existence of
heightened counterparty risk. The high degree of negative correlation of the
global factor with the VIX is striking. Building on the analyses of Adrian and
Shin (2008) and Danielsson et al. (2011), Miranda Agrippino and Rey (2012)
show that the global factor can be interpreted as reflecting the evolution of two
variables:1) the effective risk appetite of the market, defined as the weighted
average of risk aversion of leveraged value at risk investors such as global banks
and risk averse fund managers such as pension funds; 2) realised world market

We start by asking whether the positive correlations across all types of inflows
into different geographical entities (stylised fact 1, documented in detail in Rey
(2013)) are affected by the exchange rate regime of countries. Figure 5 presents

by exchange rate regime, the darker shades corresponding to floating regimes
and the lighter shades corresponding to fixed regimes. The data for the flows
are quarterly ranging between the first quarter of 1990 and the last quarter of
2012 and come from the IMF International Financial Statistics database. The
exchange rate regime data are taken from the update of the monthly de facto
exchange rate regime classification of Reinhart and Rogoff (2004) by Ilzetzki and
Reinhart (2009). The exchange rate regime is multilateral; we do not consider
bilateral regimes vis-a-vis the US dollar (though that would be an interesting
analysis to perform in itself) as monetary policy autonomy is impeded as soon
as the exchange rate is not freely floating irrespective of the base currency a
country pegs to. Hence, euro area countries have a rigid exchange rate regime
for a large part of the sample despite the fact that the euro floats against the
US dollar. The Reinhart and Rogoff coarse classification ranges from 1 to 6,
the lower numbers corresponding to the more fixed exchange rates with the
higher numbers corresponding to free floaters up till 4.12 We exclude categories
5 (freely falling currencies) and 6 (dual market in which parallel market data
is missing) due to the small number of observations available. Our regime
variable therefore takes the values 1,2,3 and 4, where lower values suggest a
more rigid regime. The exchange rate regime variable is time varying and we
use it as such in the panel regressions below. But for the heatmap we average
its value over the sample and use this time series average value to rank our
countries according to the degree of rigidity of their exchange rate regime. The
heatmap thus presents the correlation of gross inflows across countries classified
according to the average degree of rigidity of their exchange rate system over the
period (darker colours are the floaters). Correlations are green when positive
and red when negative. As evidenced by the very clear preponderance of the
green colour in the heatmaps, most gross capital inflows are positively correlated
across countries. What is remarkable is that the pattern of correlations does
not seem to be noticeably affected by the exchange rate regime. There is no
difference between the correlations involving the more flexible exchange rate
countries (darker shades) and the others.

[FIGURE 5 ABOUT HERE]

We now investigate more formally whether the exchange rate regime affects
materially the transmission of the financial cycle to countries, i.e. whether the

correlations between stock market prices and credit growth are not correlated
with the VIX (our proxy for the Global Financial Cycle) when countries have
a flexible exchange rate regime. Indeed, floating rates can in principle ensure
monetary policy autonomy and insulate countries from foreign influences. A
series of papers by Obstfeld et al. (2005), Klein and Shambaugh (2013), Goldberg (2013), Obstfeld (2014) have consistently found that short rates are less
correlated to the base country rate for flexible exchange rate countries than
for fixed exchange rate countries. Indeed policy rates are freer to move under
floating rates than under fixed rates. It remains to be seen however whether
movements in the policy rates are able to affect monetary and financial conditions significantly and provide insulation from the Global Financial Cycle (for a
more precise discussion see Rey (2014)). Interestingly, Obstfeld (2014) finds that
correlations in the long rates are unaffected by exchange rate regimes, suggesting a very imperfect ability of the policy rate to set country specific monetary
conditions for longer term investment. In this paper, we present some complementary evidence. The pattern of comovements of gross inflows does not seem
to be materially affected by the regime, as the heatmap shows. Additionally, we
investigate whether cross sectionally, the sensitivities of the local stock market
and of credit growth to the Global Financial Cycle (proxied by the VIX) are
affected by the exchange rate regime. In order to do so, we run panel regressions
of stock prices on one hand and credit growth on the other hand on the VIX
and the VIX interacted with exchange rate regime dummies, the Fed Funds rate
(allowing also for interactions) and some control variables.

first difference, si,t the stock market return of country i measured by the end of
period return of the country’s main stock market index excluding dividends, ci,t
the credit growth in country i and by xi,t and yt control variables which may
be country specific. Our panel comprises 53 countries (see Appendix A) and
the times series ranges between the first quarter of 1990 and the last quarter
of 2012. Dummy variables for exchange rate regimes are denoted by ri with
i ∈ {1; 2; 3; 4} where the low numbers denote fixed regimes and high numbers
denote the floating regimes, using the Reinhart and Rogoff classification update
as described above. We use the following specifications:13

Control variables are the lagged world GDP growth rate yt−1 and the lagged
country GDP xi,t−1 . The dummy interaction terms serve the purpose of capturing the potential heterogeneous sensitivity of a given market to US monetary
policy and to the Global Financial Cycle (proxied by the VIX) depending on
the exchange rate regime. We run fixed effects estimators with clustered standard errors by country. We have a large number of observations (between 1066
and 3982 depending on the specification). Tables 1 and 2 report the results
of the regression for stock market returns (log difference of local stock market
indices) and for credit growth (log difference in credit over GDP) respectively.
For each regression we use monthly data over the 1990-2013 period and we split
the sample in three subperiods: up to the crisis (1990 until 2007); the run up
to the crisis (2000 until 2007) and the crisis period (2007-2013).
Table 1 shows the estimated parameter coefficients for the VIX, the change
in the VIX and the Fed Funds rate. Stock returns are significantly negatively
related to the VIX in all subperiods. The interaction terms between the Fed
Funds Rate and the currency regime and the VIX (in log level and difference)
and the currency regime denote the difference in the slopes of the benchmark
case (pegged exchange rate regime, category 1 of Reinhart and Rogoff) and
the slope of regimes 2, 3 and 4. Although some of the VIX exchange rate
regime interactions are positive and significant, there is no pattern that could
be linked to degree of exchange rate flexibility as there is great heterogeneity
in the results across periods and across regimes. The only subperiods for which
the flexible regime (4) is associated with a positive interaction term are the
2000-2007 and the 2007-2013 subperiods and during these periods the overall
correlation between the VIX and the stock returns is still negative. Similarly,
whenever the interaction term between the exchange rate regime and the VIX
is positive elsewhere (for example for regime 2 during 1990-2007), the overall
effect remains negative. The change in VIX is also negatively related to the
stock returns, with some positive interaction terms for the flexible exchange
rates (regime 4) but also for relatively fixed rates (regime 2). The Fed Funds
rate tends to be either positively associated with stock returns or insignificant.
However, most interaction terms are negative and reverse the positive correlation
to a negative one for most exchange rate regimes. Hence, more rigid regimes do
not seem to be associated with a higher sensitivity of the stock market of country
i to the Global Financial Cycle (or to the Fed Funds rate) in a systematic way.
[TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE]
Domestic credit growth (Table 2) is significantly negatively related to the
VIX in all subperiods except the crisis (2007-2013) where it is positively related
12

in levels but negatively related in difference. There is again no systematic relation between the VIX and the currency regime though the interaction term
with the more flexible regime (4) and with the relatively fixed exchange rate
regime (2) is again significant in some subperiods (without overturning the sign
of the overall negative correlation). The correlation with the Fed Funds rate is
positive and sometimes significant. Once again, there does not seem to be systematic evidence that more rigid regimes are associated with a higher sensitivity
of credit growth in country i to the US monetary policy or to the VIX.
It is very important to realise that the panel regressions of this section indicate only correlations and do not imply the existence of any form of causality.
They are meant to illustrate cross sectional comovements with the Global Financial Cycle across different exchange rate regimes. To summarise our results, we
find that although there is some degree of heterogeneity in the sensitivities, no
exchange rate regime seems to be systematically associated with a significantly
lower sensitivity to the global financial cycle.

Global Financial cycle and US monetary policy

A natural next step in our investigation is to analyse the potential drivers of
the global financial cycle. Given the importance of the US Dollar on international financial markets (see Portes and Rey (1998) Shin (2013)), one prime
candidate is US monetary policy. In the domestic context financial market imperfections have been shown to be important for the transmission of monetary
policy: in the “credit channel” (Bernanke and Gertler (1995)), agency costs
create a wedge between the costs of external finance and internal funds. This
wedge depends on the net worth of firms, banks, households or on value at risk
constraints (see Adrian and Shin (2014), Bruno and Shin (2014), Borio and
Zhu (2011)) and therefore inter alia on monetary policy. As Rey (2014) points
out, the international role of the dollar as a funding currency and as an investment currency suggests that US monetary policy by affecting the net worth
of investors, intermediaries and firms worldwide may transmit US monetary
conditions across borders and jurisdictions. Hence, the existence of an ”international credit channel” that propagates the global financial cycle. In order to
investigate empirically the nature of such a transmission mechanism, we need
to evaluate the combined responses of a set of economic and financial variables
such as mortgage spreads, which are a measure of the external finance premium
to US monetary policy surprises.
As underlined by Stock and Watson (2008, 2012), the identification problem
in structural VAR analysis is how to go from the moving-average representation
13

in terms of the innovations to the impulse response function with respect to a
unit increase in the structural shock of interest, which is here the US monetary policy shock. Traditionally, imposing economic restrictions such as timing
restrictions (some variables move within the month, others are slower moving) have permitted identification of the coefficients (see Bernanke and Gertler
(1994), Christiano et al. (1996).)14 When one tries to identify the international
credit channel of monetary policy, movements in asset prices and spreads are
key, as they are related to the external finance premium or the operation of
value at risk constraints. Hence, it is of the utmost importance to use an identification strategy which allows for immediate response in asset prices, as there
is certainly no delay in those market reactions. We follow Gertler and Karadi
(2014) whose approach brings together vector autoregression (VAR) analysis
and high frequency identification (HFI) of monetary policy shocks and use the
Gurkaynak et al.(2005) surprise measures as external instruments in our VAR.15
These are very clever instruments as they measure surprises as changes in Fed
funds futures in tight windows around monetary policy announcement times.
As Fed funds future prices aggregate all available information about expected
monetary policy rates prior to FOMC meetings, any change in their prices at
the time of the meeting is very likely reflecting only a monetary policy surprise.
It is indeed unlikely that any other event dominates fluctuations in the prices
of Fed funds futures in a 30 minute or 15 minute window around the announcement. Their approach addresses the simultaneity issue of monetary policy shifts,
which influence and at the same time respond to financial variables. Following
Gertler and Karadi (2014), we use these surprises to instrument the one year
US interest rate in our VAR. The advantage of instrumenting the one year rate
(as opposed to the Fed Funds rate) is that the effect of forward guidance can
be taken into account in the estimates. This is of course particularly important
in a period where the Fed Funds rate has hit the zero lower bound.

4.1

Methodology

Our vector autoregression contains both economic and financial variables. To
identify monetary surprises we use external instruments following the methodology developed by Mertens and Ravn (2013).16 Let,
Agt =

m
X

Ck gt−k + εt

(3)

k=1

be our general structural form. The reduced form representation can be then
written as follows:
14 As is well known, Romer and Romer (1989, 2004) introduce what has been called the
”narrative approach”, that is to say use information from outside the VAR to construct
exogenous components of specific shocks.
15 For another recent study where external instruments are used to identify the structural
shocks of a VAR in the case of fiscal policy see Mertens and Ravn (2013).
16 See also Stock and Watson (2012). The program is available online.

gt =

X

Dk gt−k + ut ,

(4)

k=1

where the reduced form shock ut is a function of the structural shocks:
ut = Pεt , where Dk = A−1 Ck and P = A−1 .
We define Σ the variance-covariance matrix of the reduced form model. For
Σ, we have:
0

Σ = E[ut ut ] = E[PP0 ].

(5)

We assume gtm ∈ gt , to be the monetary policy indicator, and in particular
the US government bond rate with one-year maturity as discussed in the previous section. The exogenous variation of the policy indicator stems from the
policy shock εm
t .
Finally, p stands for the column in P corresponding to the impact of the
policy shock εm
t on each element of the vector of reduced form residuals ut . For
the impulse responses of our economic and financial variables to a policy shock
we run:
gt =

m
X

Dk gt−k + pεm
t .

(6)

k=1

As discussed in the previous section, standard timing restrictions are problematic in the presence of financial variables. For this reason, we follow the
identification strategy of Gertler and Karadi (2014) and employ their external
instruments. In order for the vector of instrumental variables zt to be a valid
set of instruments for the monetary policy shock εm
t we need:
0

E[zt εm
t = Φ]

(7)

and
0

E[zt εdt = 0],

(8)

where εdt stands for any structural shock but the monetary policy shock.
In order to compute the estimates of vector p, as a first step we need to
compute the estimates of the reduced form residuals vector ut from the least
squares regression of the reduced form representation. We denote udt the reduced form residual from the equation for variable d which is different from the
policy indicator and um
t the reduced form residual from the equation for the
policy indicator. Additionally, assume that pd ∈ p is the response of udt to a
unit increase of one standard deviation in the policy shock εm
t . From the two
stage least squares regression of udt on um
and
using
the
vector
of instrumental
t
variables zt , one can compute an estimate of the ratio pd /pm . 17
17 In particular, the variation in the reduced form residual for the policy indicator due to the
structural policy shock is first isolated by regressing um
t on the vector of instruments yielding

Results

We analyse the effect of US monetary policy shocks on the global financial cycle
(through the VIX) as well as on the US external finance premium. We then
study the effect of US monetary policy shocks on a mostly floating exchange rate
economy (the UK). According to the traditional Mundell Fleming model and
the trilemma, the UK should be insulated from US monetary policy spillovers by
movements in the dollar pound rate and should be able to set its own monetary
and financial conditions. Our empirical strategy allows us to test whether the
”international credit channel” is potent enough to put this classic idea into
question.18
US monetary policy and the Global Financial Cycle
We consider a monthly VAR on data ranging between 1979 and 2012, that
includes real economy variables such as US industrial production (seasonally
adjusted) and the US CPI as well as variables capturing the external finance
premium (US mortgage spread and US corporate bond spread). We also include
the VIX as a proxy for the Global Financial Cycle, correlated with global leverage, gross cross border flows and the global component in risky asset prices. As
discussed above, we use external instruments based on Fed Funds rate futures
surprises to identify the monetary policy shocks.19 We replicate the results of
Gertler and Karadi (2014) and find (see figure 6) , for a 20 bp shock to the US
one year rate a strong reaction of the mortgage spread (peak about 8 bp) and
of the US corporate spread (about 6 bp). Extending our analysis to global variables, we also find that a 20 bp shock in the one year rate leads to a 5 bp shock
to the VIX (logged, a standard deviation in the log VIX is 15.2 bp). We read
these Impulse Response Functions as supporting the importance of the credit
channel of monetary policy both domestically and internationally. When the
Federal Reserve tightens, the VIX goes up and global asset prices go down. In
Miranda Agrippino and Rey (2012), we use a large Bayesian VAR with 22 variables in quarterly data to study the effect of US monetary policy on the global
financial cycle. We use the narrative approach of Romer and Romer (2004) to
identify the monetary policy shocks. Our results also support the existence of
a significant effect of a Fed tightening on credit creation, capital flows, leverage of global banks and external finance premia and global asset prices. It is
comforting that two very different methodologies (a small VAR with external
instruments and a large Bayesian VAR with different external instruments) give
very consistent results.

US monetary policy spillovers into a floating exchange rate country
The ubiquity of the global financial cycle and our previous panel results seem
to indicate that even flexible exchange rate regime countries are not insulated
from global factors, yet, it is worth exploring this important question in more
detail. We estimate directly the effect of US monetary policy shocks on activity,
inflation and the external finance premium for the United Kingdom, an advanced
economy that embraced inflation targeting. We rely on the same estimation
strategy as above. The variables in the UK VAR are industrial production,
the CPI, the domestic policy rate, the mortgage spread (most widely available
series with a long time span across countries) and the VIX. Using the mortgage
spread has an additional advantage: the real estate market is central for financial
stability and has been shown to be very important in boom bust cycles around
the world. In the domestic UK context, a 17 bp increase in the US one year
rate leads to a 8 bp increase in the mortgage spread within half a year. In
the UK, a US tightening also has a significant effect on mortgage spreads. It
17

peaks at about 12 bp around 9 months after the tightening. This is of the same
order of magnitude as in the US. Rey (2014) covers an extended set of inflation
targeters and finds similar results, though with some degree of heterogeneity.
It seems that financial conditions as measured by mortgage spreads respond to
US monetary policy shocks rapidly in the UK. Whether one considers this as a
very potent transmission channel of monetary policy has to depend on whether
one thinks that channel is an important one within US borders. If one does,
one is left with the conclusion that the international credit channel cannot be
neglected.

Conclusions

Economists and policy makers have emphasised allocative efficiency and risk
sharing as the main sources of potential gains from financial integration following the insights of the textbook neoclassical growth model. But the quantitative
18

evaluation of these models shows that these gains are not very big. Together
with the relatively non conclusive large empirical literature on financial integration, this leads us to believe that large welfare gains from financial integration
are hard to find. This is particularly striking given the scale of cross border
financial flows which have increased massively. Large gross cross border flows
are moving in tandem across countries regardless of the exchange rate regime,
they tend to rise in periods of low volatility and risk aversion and decrease in
periods of high volatility and risk aversion, as measured by the VIX. Risky asset
prices around the world are also largely driven by one global component tightly
correlated to the VIX. Leverage and credit across countries show significant degrees of co-movements (and are negatively correlated with the VIX). There is a
global financial cycle. We find that the correlations of stock prices and credit
growth with the global financial cycle (proxied by the VIX) do not seem to
vary systematically with the exchange rate regime. Using a VAR methodolody
with external instruments, we also show that US monetary policy has an effect
on the VIX (a US tightening increases the VIX). Importantly we find that US
monetary policy has also an effect the United Kingdom’s external finance premium (measured by the mortgage spread), even though the UK has a floating
exchange rate regime. This seems to indicate that the insulating properties of
floating regimes may have been overestimated. It would be desirable to estimate
the effect of a Fed tightening on other measures of financial conditions (corporate spreads, effect on the term premium) and on a broader set of countries. It
would also be important to disentangle the two main channels through which
the dependence of UK monetary conditions (evidenced by the mortgage spread
reaction) on the policy stance of the United States could take place. The first
one is the ”fear of floating” (Calvo and Reinhart (2002)) whereby Central Banks
threatened by large capital flows could try to reduce the interest rate differential
with the Federal Reserve. The second one is the international credit channel
whereby even if the domestic policy rate remains unaltered domestic financial
conditions are affected by the change in monetary policy of the Federal Reserve
via the role of the dollar as an international currency. Future research will no
doubt shed further light on these issues.20

Data Appendix B
Global Factor: common factor extracted from a collection of 858 asset price
series spread over Asia Pacific, Australia, Europe, Latin America, North America, Commodity and Corporate samples. For details on extraction and original
asset prices dataset composition please refer to Miranda Agrippino and Rey
(2012).
Banking Sector Leverage: constructed as the ratio between Claims on
Private Sector and Transferable plus Other Deposits included in Broad Money
of Depository Corporations excluding Central Banks. Data are in national currencies from the Other Depository Corporations Survey; Monetary Statistics,
International Financial Statistics database. Classification of deposits within the
former Deposit Money Banks Survey corresponds to Demand, Time, Savings
and Foreign Currency Deposi ts.
Exchange rate regime data from Carmen Reinhart’s website:
We use the Exchange Rate Regime Reinhart and Rogoff Classification and
construct are dummies using the monthly coarse classification. For the purposes
of the panel regression analysis as well as for the construction of the correlation
heatmaps we exclude categories 5 and 6 as the number of occurrences is very
small for these regimes. The exact classification criteria are presented in the
exhibit below:

No separate legal tender
Pre announced peg or currency board arrangement
Pre announced horizontal band that is narrower than or equal to +/-2%
De facto peg
Pre announced crawling peg
Pre announced crawling band that is narrower than or equal to +/-2%
De factor crawling peg
De facto crawling band that is narrower than or equal to +/-2%
Pre announced crawling band that is wider than or equal to +/-2%
De facto crawling band that is narrower than or equal to +/-5%
Moving band that is narrower than or equal to +/-2% (i.e., allows for both appreciation and
depreciation over time)
Managed floating
Freely floating
Freely falling
Dual market in which parallel market data is missing.

For the panel regression we map the regime to the constructed dummy variable which allow us to use a dynamic indicator for each country. When building
28

the correlation heatmap we order the currencies according to their overall ”rigidity”, which we calculate by averaging the regime number of a country’ currency
over the sample period.
Domestic Credit: constructed as the sum of domestic claims of Depository Corporations excluding Central Banks. Domestic claims are defined as
Claims on Private Sector, Public Non-Financial Corporations, Other Financial
Corporations and Net Claims on Central or General Government (Claims less
Deposits); Other Depository Corporation Survey and Deposit Money Banks
Survey; Monetary Statistics; IFS. Original data in national currencies.
Direct Cross-Border Credit: measured as difference in claims on all
sectors or non-bank sector of a given country of all BIS reporting countries in
all currencies; Locational Statistics Database; International Bank Positions by
Residence; BIS; Tables 7A and 7B.
Nominal GDP Data in USD: original data in national currencies from
National Statistical Offices; Haver Analytics conversion using spot end of period
FX rates.
VIX: end of period readings; Chicago Board Option Exchange (CBOE).
Stock Market Indices: end of period close quotes; Haver Analytics and
Global Financial Data.
House Price Indices: OECD, BIS.
Data on Capital flows:
Source of flow data: quarterly gross capital inflows and outflows from the International Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics (accessed through
IMF website in March 2013) for: Portfolio Equity Inflows, Outflows and Net
Flows constructed as Outflows-Inflows (Assets-Liabilities) FDI Inflows, Outflows
and Net Flows Portfolio Debt Inflows, Outflows and Net Flows, and Other Investment Inflows, Outflows and Net Flows Data transformations: Flows are
reported in millions of U.S. dollars
IFS does not differentiate between true zeros and not availables; most of
the times we treat these values as errors and omissions, unless they evidently
represent zero flows. Mapping of the flows from BPM5 (until 2004 Q4) to BP6
(2005 Q1 onwards) in accordance to the guidelines of the 6th edition of the
Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual of IMF –
Reconciliation for quarters 2005 Q1 - 2008 Q4 for which there is data overlap.
Construction of Net Flows only when data on Inflows and Outflows are available
World GDP Growth (Quarterly): International Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics (accessed through IMF website in March 2013).
US GDP: Real Gross Domestic Product (Billions of Chained 2005 Dollars);

VAR Analysis
US Data
We use Gertler and Karadi (2014) variables. We complement their analysis
by adding the VIX series (logged) to the VAR.
29

UK Data
For the data used in the UK VAR spanning a period between 1995 and 2014,
we additionally employ: -Monthly CPI data and monthly industrial production
data (seasonally adjusted) from the IMF (IFS database). -A constructed mortgage spread series using monthly data from the Bank of England. The mortgage
spread is calculated as the difference of the Bank Rate Tracker (series bv24)
(extended further back with the Standard Variable Rate) from the 3M LIBOR.
-The UK policy rate calculated as a monthly average of the Official Bank rate
from the Bank of England.
