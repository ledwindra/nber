    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper uses the concept of the triad census first introduced by Holland and Leinhardt, and describes several distributions on directed graphs. Methods are presented for calculating the mean and the covariance matrix of the triad census for the uniform distribution that conditions on the number of choices made by each individual in the social network. Several complex distributions on digraphs are approximated, and an application of these methods to a sociogram is given.\n\n",
    "acknowledgement": "\nThis paper was prepared as a Ph.D. qualifying paper for the Department of Statistics at Harvard University. I an extremely grateful to Paul Holland who guided the research and made valuable comments on the data analyses conducted in Section 6. In addition, he suggested the form of the figure that appears in Section 7. I would also like to thank Professors Fred Mosteller and David Oakes who made helpful suggestions on an earlier draft of this paper, and Sandy Moriarty and Sheila Howard who typed this manuscript, and an earlier version.\n\n\n"
