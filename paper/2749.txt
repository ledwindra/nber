         Newly-developed     genetic     tests   based        on restriction     fragment   length    polymorphisms

                                                                                                 Several such tests
(RFLPs) promise to facilitate the early detection of genetic diseases.

are now available       for the prenatal detection of cystic fibrosis                  (CF), a common and costly

disease.      The tests for CF are currently             limited to prenatal         diagnosis    in siblings   of a

victim    of CF.   Direct     gene probe    tests, which have yet to be developed                 for CF, would be


applicableeven in families that have not already borne a child with the disease.                         We examine

the costs and benefits         of prenatal testing for cystic fibrosis using existing                    RFLP-based

tests and using a hypothetical direct gene probe test.                      We find that even an expensive      RAP-
based testing program produces substantial net benefits, because it is applied in pregnancies

in   which the risk of CF is 25%.          If a direct gene probe test is applied in all pregnancies,

it will need to be much less expensive to generate                     net benefits,    and it will lead to the

abortion    of many normal fetuses unless it             is    highly specific.      Because these new tests are

likely    to generate      substantial    savings in medical           expenditures    and to increase     lifetine


earnings, parents of CF-affected children may be subjected to strong pressures to participate

in prenatal    testing programs     and to abort fetuses that test positive.                It   is imperative that

the ethical dilemmas        arising from this promising screening test be discussed                   openly before

it becomes widely available.

      Affected       individuals,    their families, and society as a whole share the burden of

genetic diseases. Many victims of these diseases die during               infancy. Others face a lifetime

of intensive medical treatment,            frequent    hospitalization, and severe activity        restrictions.

The monetary cost to the patient's              family and to society can be staggering.             Less easily


quantified but also important          is the psychological toll; children who have genetic diseases


often suffer impaired psychosocial development and their parents have high divorce rates.1ZS

Few of the more than 3000 known human genetic diseases can be prevented or cured.4 However,

recent advances       in molecular   biology have led to the development of prenatal tests that can

detect these diseases, even when their precise etiologies and specific genetic defects are

unknown. The new tests, based upon restriction fragnent length polymorphisms                     (RFLP5), promise

to determine       with   near   perfect    accuracy    whether the fetus   is afflicted          with    a   genetic

disease.

      Such tests are now available for the prenatal diagnosis of one of the nost devastating

of all genetic diseases, cystic              fibrosis            This astosomal      recessive    disease,     which
                                                         (CF).

affects    the sweat      glands,   pancreas,    lungs, and other     organs,   is    incurable    and costly.5'°


Pulmonary       exacerbations    can cost nore than $18,000 if treated          in the hospital,          and older

children    may have these episodes         several tines in a year.7 While          extensive    supportive care

has prolonged       the survival of CF patients, most die by their mid-twenties.                  CF is the cost

common of all lethal genetic          diseases    among cascasians    in this country,       with an incidence

of about    1    in 2,000 births.89'5'1 The 257. risk of CF in subsequent pregnancies                    deters many


parents of children        with CF from bearing more children.72 Because many of these couples are

eager to reduce this risk of CF and give birth to unaffected children, CF is a prime target

for genetic testing.         At one CF center 92% of the still-fertile               parents with CF-affected

children    expressed     interest in prenatal diagnosis and more than 70% claimed that they would
have more children       if an accurate     prenatal test were available.'3

        We report here the results of an analysis of the costs and benefits of prenatal genetic

testing     for cystic fibrosis. Our analysis is limited to the monetary              consequences       of CF   --


 the direct     health care costs of the disease and the effects of lost income due to death and

disability.     The analysis of this test differs from many cost-benefit analyses sf health care

because the disease is incurable and can only be prevented by averting                 the birth of affected

children.     The financial     impact of the test depends on choices made by parents who discover

that their fetus is affected. If they choose to have more children, carrying to term only

those   fetuses    who test negative,        population-wide   earnings   will    rise more       than   if they

terminate     or avoid subsequent pregnancies.

        We also evaluate the consequences of testing with a direct gene probe test. Such tests

are less cumbersome and may replace RFLP testing. Although direct gene probe tests for CF

are not currently available, they could be produced soon after the CF gene                  is   identified and

sequenced, a breakthrough that many experts believe is insninent.'4'5 Unlike RFLFs, which can

only be used when there is a family history of the disease,               direct gene probes will allow

detection     of the disease gene in members of the general population, whose risk of bearing

a child with CF is about 1/500th as great. Universal application of               a   highly accurate probe.

if fetuses who tested positive were aborted, would also prevent nearly all births of CE-

affected     children.




THE   NEW   GENETIC TESTS

        Genetic   tests for the prenatal        detection of CF employ        restriction    fragment     length

polymorphisms     of the DNA       sequences   near   the   CF gene to track disease             inheritance     in

families.'6 Similar tests have been            developed    for the detection     of sickle cell anemia,

polycystic kidney disease, Huntington's          disease, and Duchenne's      muscular dystrophy.'7161023

These tests allow families to determine the disease status of             a   fetus (affected, unaffected,

or heterozygous      carrier)    as early    as the ninth week of pregnancy.           Because     RFLP testing
requires    genetic     information    from family        members to determine        whether    the fetus has the

disease,    samples must be obtained        from each parent, an affected sibling (or other affected

relative), and from the fetus at risk. These requirements usually nake it impossible to apply

RFLP testing to avert the birth of the first CF-affected child                       in a family.

        RFLP testing uses the individual's                pattern   of DNA fragments          as a marker for the

presence    or absence of the CF gene.            It places these patterns           in the context of the known

disease    states    of the family      members;     thus,      an exact    match    of RFLP5 from the affected

relative    and the fetus indicates        that the fetus is probably affected                as well. To increase

the probability      that the test will be able to discriminate between the parental chromosomes

and determine which chromosomes          carry the disease gene, the genetic probes and enzymes used

in RFLP testing are chosen to be highly polymorphic                  in   the testing population.           The ability

to distinguish the parental           chromosomes    is   called informativeness.            An uninformative     test,

because    it does not indicate         whether     the fetus     inherited a pair of the disease-carrying

chromosomes,    does not influence the probability that the fetus has the disease.

        The tightness of the linkage between the markers and the CF gene locus also affects

the performance      of the test. For example,           in   a given family the test may be informative for

two markers that appear on both sides of the CF gene. These flanking markers make it possible

to detect whether recombination          has occurred         between the CF gene and the test probe binding

site.      Similarly,     nearness    of the markers           to the     CF gene reduces       the   probability    of

recombination       and strengthens    the association between the marker and the gene.                     Commercial

laboratories claim to have accurate and informative tests because they use multiple flanking

markers;    for example, Collaborative Research of Waltham, Massachusetts,                       uses twelve probes

which flank, and are at varying distances from, the CF locus.2'

        The RFLP-baoed prenatal        tests for CF appear to be substantially               more accurate than the


alternative, enzyme assays, which are neither sensitive nor specific.°''°° Despite the great

promise of the new tests, they have significant drawbacks: they are expensive                           and they can


predict    disease      status   incorrectly.       In    routine   use,    errors    that    occur    in    laboratory
                                                           4

processing,     such as mislabeling specimens, might occur. Secondly,                       if recombination       occurs,

the RFLP patterns        might no longer be linked to the disease gene.                          Because   the    rate of

recombination     is roughly    proportional       to the distance           between tho marker and the disease

gene, and because most laboratories                use markers      that      are near the disease           gene,    such

recombination     is unlikely    for most of the available tests. Third,                    the mutation     causing CF

might not be at the same locus in all pmrsons, although this is unlikely.24 Failure to obtain

fetal tissue would preclude         testing, but ongoing improvements                 in chorionic villus sampling

and amniocentesis       are likely to diminish both the failure rate and the incidence of maternal

and fetal complications.25          It is also possible         that     a    test will        he noninformative     in a

particularfamily, but most labs now claim that their tents are informative in at least 97%

of the families tested.

        Incorrect or equivocal test results can have fateful consequences.                        False positive tests

lead to the     abortion    of unaffected      fetuses, while false                negatives    lead   to the    birth of

affected    children.    The   frequency   of these        errors   is   unknown.       No published       studies    have

reported    the sensitivity     and specificity of RFLP tests in human populations.                         Preliminary

results    of testing CF-affected       children      and their siblings              suggests that the tests are

extremely    accurate    (personal communication,          H. Kazazian,       Johns Hopkins University),            and it

is   assumed that over 99% of test results are correct.2627 However, whether these                               excellent

results will be duplicatedwhen the tests are used on a wider scale is unknown.

       For each 1,000 pregnancies tested with a test that                     is   99% sensitive and specific, 745

of the fetuses will test negative, of which two would be affected; 255 fetuses test positive,

of which seven would be unaffected.                Thus,    nine of every           1,000   tested     fetuses    will be

misdiagnosed,    two of which will have CF. Because the genetic tests are the only technology

that can reliably       determine    whether   a    fetus had CF,        it would be difficult           to verify the

false-positive    rates of these tests.            Eventually, however, the false-negative                 fetuses that

are carried to term will be recognized             as misdiagnoses.

POPULATIONS

          Prenatal     testing    for    CF based   on RFLPs can only be applied in families                 of   CF-affected

individuals. In this population, the probability that each pregnancy will yield a CF-affected

infant     (the pre-test risk)           is 0.25.    We    assume that only women who would consider abortion

will undergo testing. Since the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation currently has over 15,000 patients

in its registry, thousands of American                 families are candidates             for testing. For the analysis

of   a   hypothetical      direct gene probe test applied to the general population,                         we assume that

one in twenty caucasians                is   a heterozygous carrier of the CF gene, so that one of every

1,600 pregnancies          will be affected.6




COSTS OF CF

          Table 1 presents some published estimates of the medical expenditures for CF; although

the estimates          vary widely,          it is clear    that the amounts             involved    are many thousands       of

dollars per patient per year.                  The extraordinary       costs of caring for CF patients arise from

               hospitalizations         and the need for expensive medications,                     such as antibiotics      and
frequent

replacementpancreatic enzymes. We assume                    a   constant expense of $8000 per year for CF-related

health care. We use 25 years as our estimate of the mean life expectancy,                                 based on the most

                                                     Fibrosis Foundation.28               Annual costs of care, and all
recent      (1985) reports of the Cystic

costs and earnings in future years, are discounted                          at    5%.    These figures are conservative

estimates      of the total costs of care of cystic fibrosis, since both life expectancy and the

cost of the therapy have been increasing.

          In   cost of illness or cost-benefit                   studies,        costs    are usually divided into two

categories,          direct and indirect.29'30 A comparison is always implicit in the cost estimates;

usually the comparison            is to the expenditures             and earnings that would accrue if the disease

could      be eradicated                            The direct costs of cystic                fibrosis    include    those    of
                                 costlessly.

testing, abortion or birth, health care, and all costs associated with preventingor treating
the illness. rndirect costs are the earnings lost due to disease-related                           disabilityand early

death. When compared              to unaffected    individuals, CF patients have brief lives, frequent work

absences      (if    they    survive     to working        age   and   enter    the   labor    force),    and-    low        (often

negligible)         expected      earnings.    We define the change            in   indirect    costs, or the earnings

benefit    of testing, as the difference between the expebted value of (discounted) lifetime

earnings      under    a   testing strategy       and under a no testing strategy. Lifetime                earnings          under

a   testing    strategy depend          on additional        decisions made by the parents.          For 'example, if a

fetus tests positive,              the family opts for abortion, and they proceed to bear a normal                           child

in a subsequent tested pregnancy ("replacement" of affected and aborted fetuses), 'the change

in indirect costs is the difference between the lifetime earningsof a normal child and the

lifetime earnings           of an affected child. If they opt to abort and do not have another child

("no replacement"),               the earnings    benefit     of testing will         be the difference'between the

earnings      of an abortus and the discounted                   future   earnings     of an affected        fetus.          Pain.

suffering, and other non-monetary                 inipacts    of the disease are not included

         To compare         the    lifetime    costs   (direct and        indirect)     for    affected   and     unaffected

children,     it is necessary          to account for the total lifetime health care costs of unaffected

individuals         as welt as the decreased           earnings of individuals          with CF. Therefore,             the net

present    value of an unaffected              individuaFs lifetime health care costs is subtracted from

his or her expected lifetime earnings to get the incremental difference in totalcosts (both

indirect      and    direct)       between    unaffected      and   affected     individuals.     We estimated          average

lifetime      health care costs for the general population                     by using age-specific        annual health

expenditures from the Consumer Expenditure Survey,3' age-specific mortality'rateo                                  from U.S.

the average discounted value of'iifetime health expenditures                             at birth    is 5ll,l63               This

figure    appears      in Table 2, as         doall    the dollar      amounts used as central estimateo                 of the

costs and benefits          in our analysis. These cost estimates are from the providers                         of the tests

themselves,     local hospital charges, insurance reimbursements,                     and published reports. Although
the total lifetime health care expenditures of unaffected individuals are large, most of them

occur in the later years of life. These delayed costs add little to the present value, or

discounted lifetime costs of care, since even large costs add little to the present value

if they are delayed for many years and discounted            at a 5% annual rate.

        Prenatal RFLP testing requires tissue from the mother, father, affected relative, and

the fetus at risk.         Peripheral   blood   provides the DNA for all the family members          but the

fetus, and the cost of venipuncture is assumed to be negligible.            Costs for testing the tissue

vary: CollaborativeResearch currently charges $1,100 to test the family ($800 for the family

members and $300 for the fetus); Baylor University charges $600/family              (or $150/sample);     and

Integrated Genetics of Framingham, Massachusetts           charges $850/family.    (Although we have used

data    from Collaborative     Research    as the basis    of our analysis,    this does not imply our

endorsement of this or any other specific assay.)

        There are two methods of obtaining fetal tissue for testing.              The test in most common

use    is amniocentesis,     which can be performed beginning        at about     the sixteenth      week of

pregnancy.     Chorionic    villus sampling     (CVS) is a newer procedure    that can be performed        as

early as the ninth or tenth week of pregnancy.33 The base-case analysis assumes that CVS will

be used, because many families undergoing          prenatal genetic testing are likely to prefer the

earlier diagnosis    it provides.       In addition to these costs, a slight risk of miscarriage is

associated with each of these procedures. Aside from the risks of venipuncture itself, no

further risks result from obtaining         tissue from family members.




TEST CHARACTERISTICS

        Some laboratories     that perform      these tests, such as Collaborative       Research,    do not

report the results     of the test as           positive   or "negative."     Instead,    they   report   the

probability that the fetus will have CF. Although the test performance                   and the operating
                                                        8


characteristics      have not been studied prospectively, we assume that the test is extremely

             as the laboratories claim, and for the purposes of our calculations,                we estimate
accurate,

both the sensitivity and specificityto be 0.99. We then show how the results of our analysis

change as we modify these assumptions about test performance.



INCORPORATING     COSTS AND PROBABILITIES INTO A DECISION FRAMEWORK

       Our analysis explores the consequences of two major decisions:                   whether to test and

whether to abort. A family that decides to abort a fetus testing !positive faces a third

decision:    whether to "replace" the aborted fetus with another pregnancy. The outcomes, their

            and the probabilities     of various events are schematized         in the decision    tree that

appears     in Figure        The upper two-thirds of the tree shows the costs and outcomes based

upon a decision to test; the lower one-third is based on              a   decision    not to test. Following

conventional     notation,   this decision   tree represents      "decision    nodes," or points at which

                                              maker, ss boxes.        Circles represent      "chance nodEs,"

probabilities     of each of the outcomes. We explore the decision problem from the perspective

of a policymaker (e.g., an insurer or Medicaid official deciding whether to offer or require

these tests). The policythaker weighs the relative costs of the options and the values of the

             outcomes. The considerations     for   a   woman (or family) who has had a child with CF
possible

are displayed     in Figure 1. First, note that the pre-test probability               of CF is 0.25. If the

test   is   99% sensitive and specific, a positive test result will be obtained 25.5 percent of

the time and a negative test iesult 74.5 percent of the time. The post-test probability of

                     a   positive   test result,   is 0.97,    and   the probability of disease with           a
disease,     given

negative     test result is 0.003.

        The costs and outcome probabilities        associated with the decisions on Figure 1 are based

on the cEntral estimates (Table 2) and the following assumptions:              1)    fetuses testing positive


 are aborted;    2) under the replacEment     condition,      the families attempt to conceive,       testing
                                                        9

subsequent fetuses and aborting those that test positive, until they conceive                     a fetus that

                                                                                        do not attempt further
tests negative;          3) under the no replacement    condition,   the families

pregnancies        if the fetus    tests   positive   and is aborted;    4)   fetuses    testing negative     are

carried to term; and 5) families that refuse the test carry pregnanciesto term. The dollar

amounts on the right side of the tree are the sums of the costs and benefits for each of the

associatedoutcomes. The expected value of each branch is the product of its probability and

the costs incurred in reaching that branch (testing, abortion, live birth, and CF health care

suewned   as direct costs, and lost earnings and disability          added as indirect costs); thus, one

can work back to estimate average values for the decisions preceding                    the terminal    branches.

This results in the numbers under the words             ]j and No Test;       these numbers can be used to

compare the expected values of testing and not testing.

          A               analysis was performed on hypothetical        data for a direct gene probe that
              separate

could be applied to all pregnant women            (see Appendix).    The central assumption is that the

test would cost $10. Because CF can only be inherited if both parents are carriers, we assume

that the least expensive          way to perform such pregnancy screening would be to test only one

member of      a   couple, then test the spouses of those who test positive (sequential                strategy).

An alternative approach, testing all fetuses, would require performing amniocentesis or CVS

for every pregnancy,         and would be prohibitively     expensive unless these procedures were being

performed for other reasons. We further assume that the sensitivity                     and specificity    of the

probe would be 99%. Using these assumptions, we calculate the potential costs and benefits

of such testing, and show how the estimated benefits vary as we alter the assumptions about

the costs of the hypothetical          probe, the test accuracy, and other uncertain quantities.

      RFLP-based testing.             Figure   1   illustrates,         is the        form    of a decisiontree,            the

consequences of testing.         The cost figures are in 1985 dollars,                       and are estimated on aper

fetus basis. Negative        values are negative           costs or, equivalently,              positive       benefits.    The

expected    value of both        the direct and            indirect        costs      of testing        are    largest     with

"replacement"     of all fetuses aborted after a positive test. Since the desire                               to give birth

to unaffected children is the primary reason for testing, individuals who choose testing

would be expected to pursue the replacement strategy. The calculations for the replacement

strategy    are based on a maximum of four cycles of testing and attempted conception;                               because

25.5% of fetuses test positive             in any iound            of testing,       fewer than half           of 1% of the

families   will need to go through more than four rounds of testing before conceiving a fetus

that tests negative. Values for the total costs of testing with replacement                                    appear as the

upper of each pair of dollar values                     on Figure      1     (values    without        replacement    are    in


parentheses below). The expected            benefit       of testing         is more than        $145,000,      compared    to

aborting    the   pregnancy.    Compared    to abortion:            giving    birth    tO a child        without     prenutal

testing    produces   a   financial    benefit of over $109,000. Even in this high risk population

three-fourths     of the children       will be unaffected             and have normal          lifetime      earnings.     The

impact of testing,        then, is the difference          between these expected             values, or about $35,000

per pregnancy. Compared to giving birth at each pregnahcy,                       a   family that chooses testing with

a reØlacement     strategy generates       greater       benefits primarily because nearly                    all births are

free of the curtailed earnings          and excess health costs of CF.

      The benefits of testing are smaller                 -   about    $25,000 per fetus          --    if   the family does

not opt for replacement. This figure represents a 25% reduction in the cost of CF care. Part

of this reduced cost comes from the decreased number of live births for tested pregnancies

(all untested     pregnancies    go to term), but birth costs are a small                        fraction       of the total

health care costs for CF-affected          fetuses. The $10,000 difference between the two strategies
                                                          11


is the tradeoff between increased earnings of unaffected                fetuses born if families     replace

pregnancies    until testing is negative and the increased costs of repeated cycles of testing.

                              is economically                                      and replacement   over no
Consequently,       testing                       preferred over not testing

replacement.

          If only the direct      costs     are considered,    the least costly option would be to abort

all fetuses so that no birth, testing,            or health care expenses would be incurred. The fear

of dauntingly       high direct    costs    led many families     to use contraceptives     or to abort all

pregnancies prior to the advent of prenatal testing. However, this strategy has high indirect

          since     the lost lifetime                   of the unaffected    individuals    (estimated   to be
costs,                                      earnings

$1g8,000 per fetus) far outweigh            the expenses of birth and health care. If only earnings         or

indirect costs are considered,          one would choose not to test because testing may lead to the

abortion    and loss of earnings           of some unaffected     fetuses.   When both   types of costs are

considered,     testing reduces direct costs while keeping earnings              high.

         Population-wide      carrier   screenino.      Under the central    assumptions,   the net benefits

of population-wide       screening with a hypothetical direct gene probe are small. The benefits

depend on gene prevalence, costs of testing, and accuracy. At a relatively small level of

error, population-wide        screening will be unacceptsble because many unaffected fetuses would

be aborted.     In addition, because the majority of CF patients are born to families that have

no past history of the disease,            compliance    with testing programs will need to be extremely


high in order to decrease         the incidence of CF.

         Assuming    that the test has a sensitivity           and specificity   of •gg, and that the gene

prevalence is 1 in 20, Figure 2 shows how the net benefit per couple tested varies with the

cost of the test.       A $10 test would produce net financial benefits of $50 per tested family;

if the test cost slightly more than $50, it would generate net costs.

         The prevalence of the CF gene alters both the efficacy of the test and the net benefit

of testing.       In the high risk population,          very few errors in diagnosis will occur. In the

general population,        a screening test with the same sensitivity and specificitywill result
                                                        12

in more misdiagnoses.        For example,      the RFLP-based test in families with a prior history of

CF results in misdiagnosis less than 1% of the time.                 In the general population, where the

risk    is approximately 0.06%,          there will   be 29 falsely negative        and 19 falsely positive

results    per 1,000 tested        fetuses,     for an error rate of almost          5% (see the Appendix).

Therefore, the successful application of prenatal genetic testing in high risk families with

one or more CF-affected children does not imply that such                   a   test will be useful     in other

populations.



SENSITIVITYANALYSIS

        The values of several parameters used to cal cul ate           the costs    and   benefits of prenatal
screening    for   CF    are uncertain.        We   assessed the    sensitivity     of our findings to the

assumptions     about     the   values    of   key parameters,      including      the   test   characteristics

(sensitivity and specificity),           lifetime earnings, and the costs of testing, abortion, birth,

and health care for both CF-affected            and unaffected     individuals.

        RFIP-based      testing.   The net benefits of testing, assuming that parents attempt to

conceive another child after aborting a fetus which tests positive (i.e., replacement),                      range

from about $9,000        if CF does not generate any excess health expenditures,                to over $35,000

if CF care costs $8,000 annually, to over $75,000 if CF care costs $20,000 annually.                          The

net benefit    of RFIP-based testing without replacement              is   about $12,000    less than for the

replacement strategy at any level of cost of CF care; the net benefit is positive under no

replacement if CF care costs more than about $1,000 annually.

        As Figure 3 demonstrates, the net benefits of testing rise with the lifetime earnings

of an unaffectedindividual if the parents attempt replacement. Net benefits decline slightly

with earnings      under a policy        of no replacement because falsely aborting             a   normal   fetus

becomes more costly as lifetime           earnings rise.

        A test that is frequently noninformative produces smaller benefits, on average, than

a   highly informative     test.   The diminution in benefits that results           from noninformativeness
                                                            13

depends on actions that the parents take when they confront a noninformative                          test.    The net

benefits are always greater if the parents opt against abortion                         in this situation, but even

if they choose to abort when the test is noninformative, the test generates net benefits as

long as it is informative           about 85% of the time or more (Figure 4). Each of the commercial

laboratoriei that we contacted claims that their test's informativeness substantially exceeds

this value.

        Although    the benefits       of using a screening test depend on the accuracy of the test,

as reflected       in the sensitivity        and specificity, the benefits of CF testing change                  little

with test accuracy        in the range of relevant          values.     These tests are highly sensitive            and

specific,      and the RFLP-based      tests are applied in a high-prevalence               population.       As Figure

5 demonstrates,      the net benefit of testing changes little as the test sensitivityor test

                 falls   from   1   to .9;   if the upecificity       is   1,   the net benefit of testing         falls
specificity

from about      $38,000 to $32,000 as sensitivity            declines from 1 to .9; the net benefit                falls

somewhat    less if the specificity            declines     from 1    to .9.      The    purported   sensitivity    and

specificity      of all commercially available testu are substantially higher than the lower end

of the ranges displayed here.

        The net benefits of RFLP testing decline little as the cost of testing increases; even

if it   cost    $5,000 to test a family, the net benefits of testing would exceed $20,000 with

no replacement,      and $30,000 with replacement.

        Carrier     screening.       In addition       to the unknown cost of the hypothetical gene probe

test, the sources of uncertainty              in the estimates of the net benefits of carrier screening

are the gene prevalence in the tested population and the accuracy of the test. Figure 6 shows

how the net benefit per tested couple for CF screening varies with gene prevalence                            (assuming

full compliance and a $10 test).             In   a   population with a gene prevalence of 1 in 40 (0.025),

the benefits      of screening       are small. If the prevalence is 1 in 20, the net benefit exceeds

$40 per couple.

          The test cost that is just high enough so that the benefits of a
                                                                           testing program equal
the costs is called the threshold cost.         At this cost, the decision maker will be indifferent

between screening and not screening       the population. Figure 7 shows the relation between the

threshold     cost of the screening and the gene prevalence.      The benefits exceed the costs of

testing     as long as the test costs    less than $100, if the gene prevalence      is 70 per 1,000.

If the prevalence is 40 per 1000, the test produces net benefits only if it costs less than

$40.

        As with the RFLP test, the accuracy of a carrier screening test will strongly influence

the net benefit of a screening program. Figure 8 shows how the sensitivity and
                                                                               specificity
affect those benefits. As in Figure 5, net benefits are positive            for the expected   accuracy

for the test (sensitivity 99% and specificity 99%). However, the benefit vanishes               if both

sensitivity and specificity      are less than 95%.




                                                DISCUSSION
        Although they have not undergone extensive clinical evaluation,       RFLP-baued tests appear

to be highly sensitive and specific assays for genetic diseases. For many of the csnditions

that they detect, alternative     tests are either inaccurate or unavailable.

        Cystic fibrosis is perhaps the most promising candidate for prenatal screening becausv

it is common,    its treatment is costly, and it is ultimately     fatal.    Other genetic diseases,

such as some forms of muscular      dystrophy    and lipid storage disorders,    usually cause death

early in infancy and do not result       in several years of burdensome      expenditures   for health

care.     Some other genetic diseases,     such as Huntington's   disease,   do not cause morbidity
until late in the course of the disease, so that the excess medical
                                                                    expenditures attributable

to the disease are small compared to the direct costs of CF.         A large number of other fatal

genetic    diseases   are exceedingly   rare.   The intense efforts to develop     tests    for CF are
stimulated by its importance as a cause of suffering as well as by the scientific
                                                                                  challenges
it presents.

       Existing genetic tests for CF are limited to families that have already borne children

with the disease.         In this population,       the 25% prevalence    of disease means that the tests

will misdiagnose very few fetuses.            In   the general population,    CF occurs in only about one

of 2,000 births. A screening test applied to all fetuses would need to be extremely specific

to avoid the abortion        of many unaffected        fetuses.    The costs of fetal testing,            and the

chances for error, could         be reduced by first testing all pregnant women,            then testing the

spouses of those who test positive for the gene, and only testing fetuses after both parents

test positive      (see Appendix).      Even this strategy would         require a highly    accurate      assay.

Furthermore,      the cost of averting        the birth of a child with CF would be high unless               the

screening    test were inexpensive.

       While RFLP-based tests usually cannot be applied until a family has borne a child with

the disease,      the families   that use the tests can be confident that they will be able to bear

unaffected    children.    If prenatal testing enables these families           to have nore children,         of

whom two-thirds will be CF carriers, the CF gene will become more prevalent among adults of

childbearing      age. Carrier screening may also increase the gene prevalence by increasing the

number of childbearing        heterozygotes.       The prevalence of genes linked to the CF gene would

increase as well. The long-term consequences             of the change in the genetic composition of the

population are unknown.




ETHICAL ISSUES

       Increased     concern about the magnitude         of health expenditures motivates      the quest for

opportunities     to lower the costs of treating illnesses. The new tests for prenatal diagnosis

of cystic    fibrosis     represent    such    an opportunity.    The government    programs        and   private

insurance    companies     that pay for some        of the costs of cystic fibrosis         will have strong

incentives to pressure parents of affected children to participate in screening prograns                      and

to abort affected fetuses. Even when the costs of testing exceed $1,000, participation                         in

such   programs    will   generate    large    savings   for   insurers. While insurers       and    government
                                                       16


programs might not compel families to submit to testing and to abort affected                     fetuses, they

could deny reimbursement         for health care of the "preventable"            cases   of CF. Because the

disease can only be prevented by aborting affected              individuals, many people will object to

testing    and    its implications.     Others   will feel that     the large    savings that result         from

                                                                                                     to pay for
screening justify its widespreadadoption, and that there is no social obligation

the care of a disease that could           have been prevented.      It is likely      that testing will be


advantageous      for insurers   even in the absence of coercion,           since a high percentage     of the

families    at risk are likely to comply voluntarily.               Nevertheless,      in the     absence   of a

consensus on these issues or of a procedure to balance the rights of families at risk against

the costs to the larger population, it is imperative that these implications of screening

be discussed and evaluated openly before testing becomes widely available.

      A    direct gene probe test presents         somewhat different issues. It could sharply reduce

the number of CF births because it could be applied to all pregnant mothers,                    not just those

who had given birth to an affected child.               But because disease prevalence          is low in the


                          prenatal     testing   of all fetuses would        lead to the abortion      of many
general    population,

unaffected fetuses. The sequential strategy described above, which tests the fetus only if

both parents are found to be carriers, would sharply limit the number of false-positive                     tests

while producing       a small number of additional          false-negative    tests,   compared    to prenatal


testing     of all    fetuses.   Regardless      of the strategy,     any    test applied to the general

population would need to be relatively inexpensive to generate a net savings in health costs.

Consequently,      there is weaker pressure to test the general population than to test affected

families.

      Cystic fibrosis is one of many genetic diseases that will become targets for prenatal

testing with novel molecular biology techniques.               The strategies that result from prenatal

diagnosis    of such conditions need not be limited to abortion, but might include lifetime

monitoring       for signs of disease so that specific        treatment could be instituted         early. Some

fear that a "brave        new world"    of eugenics will be forged from genetic testing programs.
                                              17

Parents who seek the "perfect child" might abort fetuses with mild abnormalities   or handicaps

that could be detected by prenatal tests. Whether these fears will become reality depends

on the responsible development and application of genetic tests. While the risk that any
                                                                                  benefits
genetic test will be misused is real, it must be balanced against the substantial

that the new tests offer to families plagued by genetic disease.

APPENDIX:      THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A SEQUENTIAL STRATEGY FOR POPULATION-WIDE                       SCREENING



      One parent is tested first.              The second parent is tested only if the test shows that

the firot parent       is a carrier of the CF gene.                 If both parents    test positive,     the fetus

undergoes testing      for CF.

      Assuming     that 1/20th of individuals            of child-bearing age carry the CF gene, and that

affected    individuals    are as likely to survive to birth as other fetuses,                    approximately    one

in 1,600 births will result         in   CF.    In   the following calculations we present rates per one

million pregnancies;       if no abortions are performed, 625 of these pregnancies will result                      in

the birth of an infant with cystic fibrosis.

      If the sensitivity         and specificity        of a direct gene probe test are each gg%, the test

yields the outcomes at each stage of testing                 as   described in Figure g. The remainder of this

appendix    describes how the consequences           of testing were assessed.



Stage I --   tasting    the first parent:

                                               Test +                   Test    -




                  CF gene +                    49,500                        500          50,000

                 CF gene    -                   g,soo                  950,000          950,000

                                               5g,000                  941,000         1,000,000


      The 2x2 table above shows the resulto of testing                  in    this population,    classified    by the

true genetic status of the individuals.              Of 1,000,000 parents tested, there will be only 500

false-negatives    and 9,500 false-positive             test results.     A   false-negative     result leads to no

further testing.       One of every 80 false-negatives               at the first stage will later result in

the birth of an    infant with CF (1/20 chance of pairing with another carrier, multiplied by

1/4 chance that a child will have CF when both parents are carriers).                            Consequently,    the

500 false-negative      test results      at Stsge       I   will result in the birth of approximately             six
                                                                19

children       with CF.        All positive    test results lead to further testing            (Stage II).



               --
Stage     11        testing     the second parent:


                                                     Test +                Test   -




                      CF gene +                   2,920.5                   29.5             '2,950

                      CF gene -                       560.5             55,489.5             56,050

                                                     3,481              55,519               59,000


          The 59,000 spouses of individuals                  testing positive     in Stage I also undergo testing.

Of these individuals,              2,950   will      be carriers     of the CF gene.        Approximately 30 of the

carriers       will test negative.           Since    about 16% of the individuals testing positive            in Stage

I   were fal ne-positives, 21% of the false-negatives at Stage                     II   (rather than 25%) will result

in the birth of children with CF.                    Consequently,    false-negative     tests at Stage II result in

the birth of about 6 infants with CF.



Stage Ill       -
                    testing     the fetus:

                                                     Test +                Test   -




                      CF   ÷                      606.4                     6.1               612.5

                      CF -                           28.7                2839.8              2868.5

                                                  635.1                  2845.9              3461.0

          Stage     III tests     the 3,481    fetsses whose parents both tested positive.             Because 560.5

of the Stage II tests are false-positives,                     and because about 16% of the true positives in

Stage II are spounes of individuals                   who had a false-positive          test result in Stage    I,   only

2450.25 of the 3,481 fetuses tested are offspring of two carriers.                            Thus the prevalence      of

CF   in   the Stage III population            is 17.6%, rather than the 25% expected             in the offspring      of

two carriers.
                                               20

      This sequential   strategy results   in relatively    few false-positives;    despite   the low

prevalence of CF among all births, there will be only zg false-positive          tests in Stage III,

meaning that the chances of aborting a normal fetus because of prenatal          screening would   be

three in 100,000 pregnancies.    There are six false-negative       tests in Stage    III; thus the

number of unexpected births of affected    infants is about ig (slightly more than six births

resulting from false-negatives   in each stage of testing).      Consequently,     1,062,481 genetic

tests and 3,481 fetal tissue sampling procedures    (amniocentesis or CVS) were done to detect

606 fetuses with CF, resulting in the abortion of 2g normal infants and missing ig affected

infants.   If each test cost $10, and amniocentesis        or CVS cost $1,000, the cost per case

detected would be $23,260.   A less sensitive test would have a higher cost per case detected,

while a less specific test might also be more costly because it would result in more Stage

III testing.   Furthermore, lower specificity would lead to the abortion of more fetuses who

did not have CF.
