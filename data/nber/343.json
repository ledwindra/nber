The problem inherits a special form because the regimes in which the equilibria can lie are each linear. By placing restrictions on the parameters that insure the uniqueness of such a solution for each value of the exogenous and random variables, we can improve the estimation procedure. This paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for uniqueness -- or \"coherency.\" These conditions are applied to a variety of models that have been prominent in the literature on econometrics with 'switching regimes' such as those of self-selectivity (Maddala), simultaneous equation tobit and probit (Amemiya, Schmidt) and multi-market macroeconomic disequilibrium (Gourieroux, Laffont and Nonfort).\n\n",
