    "abstract": "\n\nAbsent explicit quotas, incentives, reporting, or fiscal year-end motives, drug approvals around the world surge in December, at month-ends, and before respective major national holidays. Drugs approved before these informal deadlines are associated with significantly more adverse effects, including more hospitalizations, life-threatening incidents, and deaths \u2013 particularly, drugs most rushed through the approval process. These patterns are consistent with a model in which regulators rush to meet internal production benchmarks associated with salient calendar periods: this \u201cdesk-clearing\u201d behavior results in more lax review, leading both to increased output and increased safety issues at particular\u2014and predictable\u2014periodicities over the year.\n\n",
