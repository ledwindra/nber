JEL No. I18
ABSTRACT
This paper estimates the number of people at risk of contracting malaria in Africa using GIS methods
and the disease's epidemiologic characteristics. It then estimates yearly costs of covering the population
at risk with the package of interventions (differing by level of malaria endemicity and differing for
rural and urban populations) for malaria as recommended by the UN Millennium Project. These projected
costs are calculated assuming a ramp-up of coverage to full coverage by 2008, and then projected out
through 2015 to give a year-by-year cost of meeting the Millennium Development Goal for reducing
the burden of malaria by 75% We conclude that the cost of comprehensive malaria control for Africa
is US$3.0 billion per year on average, or around US$4.02 per African at risk.

INTRODUCTION
The burden of malaria in Africa continues to be extremely high, despite the existence of
effective interventions to curb the mortality and morbidity of the disease. Every year, up to three
million people die from malaria on the continent.1 The Millennium Development Goals set in
2000 recognize that malaria must be controlled if Africa is to escape from the cycle of extreme
poverty and disease. The MDG on malaria is to “Have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the
incidence of malaria,” which has been made more specific by the UN Millennium Project’s
working group on malaria as “Reduce malaria morbidity and mortality by 75 percent by 2015
from the 2005 baseline level.” In January 2005, the working group on malaria recommended that
countries where malaria is rife should use an integrated package of preventive and treatment
methods to achieve this goal.2 The project also recommended that insecticide treated mosquito
bed nets and effective malaria drugs be given away free of charge, a move endorsed by UN
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in March, and by heads of state at the UN World Summit in
September 2005.
There are existing, effective methods to control malaria: prevent people from being bitten
by mosquitoes — using insecticide treated bed nets and insecticide spray applications — treat
those who get infected with effective drugs such as artemisinin-based combination therapies
(ACTs), promote health education and communication, and conduct monitoring and evaluation.
This paper estimates the number of people at risk of contracting malaria in Africa using GIS
methods, and then estimates the yearly costs of covering the population at risk with the package
of interventions recommended by the UN Millennium Project.

DERIVATION OF POPULATION AT RISK

2

Due to lack of adequate data collection in Africa’s health system, there is incomplete
information on the morbidity and mortality associated with malaria.3 The WHO Global Burden
of Disease program estimates burden in Africa through “active” case-detection studies of
populations living under different transmission intensity risks, which is subject to underdetection. Several alternative studies have estimated population at risk using other methods,
including estimates based on national surveys,4 estimates based on climate suitability for malaria
transmission,5,6 and estimates based on maps of the geographic extent of malaria in a Geographic
Information System (GIS).7
We follow the GIS-based strategy by overlaying the following maps: a high-resolution
(30 arc-seconds) map of 2005 human population;8 a map of country boundaries, the most recent
(2002) map of the extent malaria of risk9 (shown below); a map of malaria endemicity levels
constructed in 196810 (shown below); and a map of the extent of urban areas.8 The latter four
maps were rasterized to the same 30 arc-second cell size. Population sums were then calculated
by country for the following categories: total population within the malaria risk zone, population
within a malaria risk zone and within an urban zone, population within a malaria risk zone and
within a zone of unstable malaria transmission (either hypoendemic or mesoendemic zones in the
endemicity map), and population within a malaria risk zone, an urban zone, and a zone of
unstable transmission. (Note that areas showing up on the 1968 endemicity map but are outside
the area of 2002 malaria risk are considered to no longer have malaria and are ignored). The
resulting estimate for population at risk of malaria in Africa in 2006 is 672 million people, of
which 485 million are in rural areas (see Table 1). Finally, we used the UN Population Division’s
median forecast of projected population to calculate a population growth rate for each country,
and used it to estimate the population in each country in the above categories for every year

3

between 2006 and 2015. This now allows us to calculate the cost of each intervention, by country
and by year, based on the urban and rural population at risk, in stable and unstable malaria
transmission areas.

DESCRIPTION OF COMPREHENSIVE INTERVENTIONS
The interventions included in this costing exercise encompass most of the key interventions
recommended by the UN Millennium Project, and many details of the costing follow those of the
report of the Working Group on Malaria.2 For prevention of disease, they include long-lasting
insecticidal bed nets (LLINs), indoor residual spraying (IRS) in unstable transmission areas,
training of community health workers, and cost of an information, education, and
communication program. For enhanced diagnosis and treatment, they include microscopy, rapid
diagnostic tests, effective drugs such as artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs) for
uncomplicated malaria, and treatment of severe malaria. Finally, the costing includes resources

4

for monitoring and evaluation, and for the overhead costs of a global push on malaria control.
Below are the assumptions made for each intervention:

•

Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs): Following the UN Millennium Project’s
recommendation, we calculate the cost of complete coverage of LLINs for the population
at risk by the end of 2008, with a ramp-up of coverage during 2006, 2007, and 2008.
Note that this is a more ambitious target than other costing exercises; the efficacy of
LLINs and the mass action effect implies that the entire population, and not just children
and pregnant women, should be targeted by LLIN distribution programs.11 We assume
that one net is needed for every two people at risk. The cost of LLINs is around $5, with
an additional $2 estimated cost of storage and distribution, and the net needs to be
replaced after 5 years (as is the case with Olyset nets).12 Note that long-lasting nets do not
need to be re-impregnated with insecticide during their 5-year lifespan.

•

Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS): Selective vector control (including IRS) was part of
the WHO’s Global Strategy for Malaria Control which was adopted by the Ministerial
Conference in 1992 and subsequently endorsed by the World Health Assembly (WHA)
and the UN General Assembly. The Global Strategy was also taken up by the RBM
partnership for the use of selective control in appropriate epidemiological settings.
Recently, the U.S.’s President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) has also emphasized the benefits
of IRS. We have estimated the average annual cost of using IRS against malaria in
unstable transmission areas at $206 million. However, the cost of blanket spraying all
malaria transmission areas is $1.1 billion or up to $2 billion considering intense

5

transmission areas require more than one round of spraying per year. Thus blanket
coverage with IRS seems prohibitively expensive, especially since intense transmission
areas will be scaling up LLIN coverage, and LLINs are easier to distribute, last for up to
five years, face less complex logistic challenges than IRS, and require fewer human
resources. We therefore include costs for IRS in unstable transmission areas only, since
these areas higher risks of mortality (note that there are some stable transmission areas of
special economic consideration, such as resorts or mining operations, where private
sector budgets will cover the high per capita costs of IRS). We assume that Lysenko’s
map of endemicity in Africa continues to represent relative transmission strength in
Africa today, since unlike other parts of the world, the continent has benefited from few
anti-malaria interventions. We consider the areas of the 2002 extent of malaria risk which
are hypoendemic and mesoendemic in Lysenko’s map to be low- and moderatetransmission and thus recommended for IRS. (This area, encompassing much of eastern
African, part of southern Africa and the Sahel countries is roughly the area experts
describe as having unstable transmission13). By overlaying this area with the population
map, we estimate that 149 million people lived in low- and moderate-transmission areas
in Africa in 2005. We follow the costing methodology of the UN Millennium Project
Working Group on Malaria. Since costs are at the household level, we assume an average
of 5 people per household, that each household has about 300 m2 of surface that needs to
be sprayed, that each square meter requires 2.67 grams of insecticide (DDT, the
insecticide of choice), add a ten percent margin of insecticide, and use a cost of US$4.3
per kilogram of insecticide (this cost corresponds to DDT). In addition, we cost labor
requirements for IRS. We divide number of households by 360 person-days to get the

6

number of spray persons needed. We assume 5 spray persons for each squad, 5 squads for
each team and for each technician, and 1 supervisor for 5 teams. Wages were set at
US$10 per day for the spray persons (for 40 days of work plus 6 training days), US$15
per day for squad chiefs and technicians (both also for 46 days), and US$20 per day for
supervisors (for 18 person-days of work). For field equipment, we include a tent
(US$2000) for each team and each supervisor, and add $100 per person for all personnel
for coveralls, handgloves, goggles, buckets, soaps, etc., and US$0.06 in forms and
stationary for each household sprayed. For the first year (2006) we include the cost of the
spray pump and spare parts (US$500) for each spray person. Finally, we recognize the
costs of other logistics, including vehicles to transport equipment and personnel, spare
parts and maintenance, fuel and lubricant, and insurance for the spraying team and
vehicles. Since the UN Millennium Project Working Group on Malaria estimated costs
for these items in Ethiopia based on number of districts, we cannot replicate the costing
in this exercise (since we are only working with population at risk in each country). We
therefore totaled these costs (for every year) in the Working Group’s exercise and found
them to be 30% of the other costs of IRS (which we do model). We therefore added 30%
of total IRS costs as an estimate of the cost of logistics.

•

Training Community Health Workers (CHW): An RBM survey indicated that
between 70% and 90% of febrile children are treated at home.2 There is therefore an
urgent need to treat uncomplicated malaria at the community level, especially given
evidence of decreased child mortality among those who see a community health worker
(CHW).14 A number of countries are seeking to improve coverage by extending health

7

services using CHWs for malaria diagnosis and treatment services. We assume that one
CHW is needed per 500 population, and that training for malaria control lasts 8 days and
costs $10 per day. .

•

Human Resource Development: Note that there are other needs in human resource
development; the Malaria Working Group indicates that besides CHWs, training of
nurses, physicians, entomologists and malariologists will be needed to guide and
implement the program activities. However, these costs are estimated based on the size of
the formal health sector (number of hospitals, etc.), and are not estimated based on the
size of the population at risk. We approximate the costs based on the methodology of the
Working Group on Malaria as follows: we consider the total cost of leadership training
for program managers and topping up salary for medical officers, epidemiologists,
entomologists, biologists, health officers, nurses, environmental health workers, and
malaria technicians. The estimated costs total $704 million for Ethiopia from 2005--2015.
Using our estimate of population at risk, we find that this number of human resource
development needs translates into around $1.00 per person at risk per year, and use the
same assumption for all countries in Africa based on population at risk.

•

Microscopy: We expect that health facilities such as health centers, rural hospitals, and
all hospitals in urban areas will use microscopic examination of stained thick and thin
blood smears, the gold standard for malaria diagnosis. The Working Group on Malaria
estimates the cost of microscopy using the numbers of hospitals and other health centers
in a country, which cannot be duplicated in this paper. We therefore estimate the cost of

8

microscopy as we did for topping-up of salaries. The Working Group on Malaria
estimated that the total cost of microscopy for Ethiopia from 2005--2015 to be around
$29 million. Using our estimates of population at risk, we find that this number is
equivalent to around $0.04 per person at risk per year, and use this number to estimate
microscopy costs for all the countries. Note that microscopes can be used for other
purposes (TB, other parasitic and bacterial diseases).

•

Rapid Diagnostic Testing (RDT): Given that peripheral levels of the health system –
particularly rural areas – often cannot meet the laboratory requirements for microscopy, a
variety of simple and rapid diagnostic tests have been developed for accurate and reliable
malaria diagnosis by community health workers and health facilities. We assume that
RDT should be used only in unstable transmission areas, for all age groups.

In areas of intense transmission, where severe disease and mortality are largely
concentrated in children under five years of age, malaria should be treated on the basis of
clinical suspicion of malaria and not on confirmed diagnosis by RDTs. People older than
5 years of age have a well developed level of immunity, are at lesser risk of developing
severe malaria and a significant proportion are asymptomatic in the presence of malaria
parasites. This group (above 5 years old living in intense transmission areas) constitutes
the bulk of the febrile cases in Africa (we estimate around 218 million fever episodes)
and at the moment will be too expensive to subject every one of them to RDT
examination. They should therefore be treated clinically on the basis of seasonality and
clinical manifestation of the disease.

9

We use the UN Population Division’s World Population Prospects’ demographic
breakdown for every year between 2006 and 2015 to divide our population at risk into
groups aged 0--4, 5--9, 10--14, and 14+. Following WHO guidelines, the first age group
does not require RDT, since in patients below age 5 every fever episode immediately
receives malaria treatment due to the possibility of misdiagnosis.15 Following similar
assumptions to the costing done by the UN Millennium Project Working Group on
Malaria, the 5--9 and 10--14 age groups are assumed to experience one fever episode per
year and the age 14+ group experiences 0.5 fever episodes per year (these are taken as the
average number of fevers from all causes, across all endemicity levels). One RDT kit is
needed for each of these fever episodes (again, we restrict ourselves to unstable
transmission areas), and costs at US$0.61 per kit. Note, that we have built into the model
a decrease in fever episodes as LLIN coverage increases: we assume that the proportion
of the population covered by LLINs has a 50% reduction in fever episodes (measured
reduction in morbidity has ranged from 44%--75%16,17,18,19). This decreases the need for
RDT as LLIN coverage increases. Moreover, we have assumed that the number of fever
episodes for populations living in urban areas is 25% smaller, since transmission tends to
be lower in urban areas.

•

Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs): We again calculated fever
episodes for each of the four age groups mentioned above (including the 0--4 age group,
which we assume experience 2 fever episodes per year). We assume that RDT in unstable
transmission areas will reveal that around 40% of the fevers are due to malaria and

10

require ACTs (as was assumed by the UN Millennium Project Working Group on
Malaria). In intense transmission areas, on the other hand, we assume that 20% of the
fever episodes will be examined by microscopy, and these will have a slide positivity rate
of 40% (Ethiopia’s current slide positivity rate). The 80% of fevers not examined by
microscopy all require ACTs. Our total number of fever episodes requiring malaria
treatment in 2006 is 395 million, which is within the range of other published estimates.20
We assume that each treatment course can be treated with either artemether-lumefantrine
or artesunate-amodiaquine. Artemether-lumefantrine is assumed to cost US$0.45 for the
0--4 age group, US$0.90 for the 5--9 age group, US$1.35 for the 10--14 age group, and
US$1.80 for the 14+ age group.21,22 Artesunate-amodiaquine is estimated to cost US$0.23
for the children under 1, $0.45 for the 1--6 age group, US$0.80 for the 7--13 age group,
and $1.48 for the 13+ age group (we use RBM’s recommended dosages23 and averages of
prices from Sanofi-Aventis, Ipca, and Cipla,24 and adjust to match age groups in our
analysis). We use the average of the cost of artemether-lumefantrine and artesunateamodiaquine. As above, we assume a 50% reduction in fever episodes for the population
covered by LLINs, and 25% fewer fever episodes among urban populations. For intense
transmission areas, this is a 50% reduction in all fevers; for unstable transmission areas, it
is a 50% reduction of fevers that needs ACTs, that is, a 50% reduction of the original
40% of total fevers. ACT production is a bottleneck, as discussed below; we assume that
enough ACTs will be produced to meet need starting in 2008, but for 2006 and 2007
there will be a shortage. We include a US$0.10 cost of using other drugs (sulfadoxinepyrimethamine (SP)-amodiaquine combination or SP-chloroquine combination) to treat
the fevers that will not be treated with ACTs in 2006 and 2007. It is expected that in a

11

year’s time, ACTs such as dihydroartemisinin piperaquine will become available,
resulting in overall increased production and cost reduction.

•

Management of Severe Malaria: We include a rough approximation of management of
severe malaria, using the median cost of $29.50 for managing a severe malaria case as
derived by WHO/AFRO.25 We assume that about 1% of the malaria episodes would
progress to severe malaria.26

•

Information, Education and Communication: A program to educate communities and
promote behavioral change is an important element in successful malaria reduction. The
program should produce information, education, and communication materials targeting
health workers, community leaders, and communities; it should use radio spots,
television, drama and other educational media to increase treatment-seeking behavior,
compliance, and use of LLINs, target IRS; and organize sensitization and advocacy
meetings at district, regional, and national levels. The Working Group on Malaria
estimated that the cost of IEC for Ethiopia $614,000 per year. Using our estimates of
population at risk, we find that this number is equivalent to around $0.011 per person at
risk per year, and use this number to estimate IEC costs for all the countries.

•

Monitoring and Evaluation: Monitoring and evaluation are essential components of
malaria control programs to track effectiveness of the interventions over time. Activities
involve assessment of routine health services data and periodic community and
household surveys in order to develop process indicators for implementation, and

12

outcome indicators for case management, prevention, and program impact.27 In addition,
the effectiveness of antimalarials and insecticides must be monitored. Following the
standard practice in programs funded by the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria,
we add 7% of costs as monitoring and evaluation.

•

Overhead Costs: Finally, we add 10% of the cost to account for the overhead costs in a
global effort to reach full coverage of these malaria interventions by 2008.

Using our estimated population at risk and the costing assumptions above, we arrive at the
projected total yearly costs for all of Africa shown in Table 2 and graphed below:

Global Overhead Costs

The most striking fact from these numbers is their modest magnitude. Given that we are talking
about a disease that kills around two million African children every year, the fact that full

13

coverage of LLINs and ACTs (plus the other interventions) costs only $3.00 per African (or
$4.02 per person at risk of malaria) is astounding and encouraging.
We examined these numbers in comparison with earlier studies. The UN Millennium
Project Working Group on Malaria performed a detailed costing of interventions for Ethiopia,
and arrived at an average of US$238 million per year, which comes to around US$2.70 per
capita per year (compared to $3.00 in our results above; note that unlike the working group, we
include salaries for CHWs, without which our per capita cost is $2.29). Another costing estimate
(Kiszewski A and others, unpublished) of malaria interventions for Africa results in $1.7 billion,
an equivalent of around US$2.10 per person at risk per year. It is heartening that our GIS-based
approach and different costing assumptions produce similar results and corroborate the
magnitude of the per capita cost of these interventions.

SCALING UP TO FULL COVERAGE IN 2008
Given that our model assumes full coverage of LLINs by the end of 2008, it is instructive
to look at costs before 2008 carefully. In order to reach full coverage of all interventions by
2008, the international community needs to begin planning ahead to guarantee sufficient
production of LLINs and ACT treatment courses. Full coverage in 2008 means that around 352
million nets must be distributed in Africa by the end of that year. Around 20 million nets have
been distributed in 2005 (the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria – the largest provider
of resources for malaria control in Africa – has approved purchases of around 22--31 million
LLINs between 2005 and 2007, and we looked at the GFATM disbursement reports and found
that roughly 20 million nets had been distributed in 2005). Our costing model above includes a
ramping up of distribution to 100 million new nets in 2006, 110 million new nets in 2007, and

14

122 million new nets in 2008. Since production of LLINs by the two producing companies
(Sumitomo and Vestergaard) in 2006 is currently planned for around 80 million nets, the donor
countries should commit as soon as possible to funding a scale up of production in 2007 and
2008 so that full coverage can be reached by 2008. Two other LLIN products from other
manufacturers are also expected to be in the market soon, which would alleviate the production
capacity constraint.
With regard to treatment, the current estimate for production of ACTs in 2006 is 130
million treatment doses, which is insufficient to meet the estimated 395 million treatments
needed. In 2006 and 2007, our costing model assumes that fevers that cannot be treated with
ACTs will be treated with either SP-amodiaquine combination or SP-chloroquine combination,
which both cost about US$0.10. By 2008, we assume that enough ACTs will be produced to
meet the need, which our projections show to be around 251 million treatment courses. This
implies a doubling of ACT production between now and 2008. For our model, we use the
estimated 130 million treatment courses for 2006 production, and in order to ramp up to 251
million by 2008, we use 200 million as the number of ACT treatments produced in 2007. Again,
since ACTs are produced by private companies, this increase in production can only happen if
donors agree in advance to purchase the required treatment courses.
Note that this costing exercise was carried out in early 2006; since scale up in 2006 has
been slower than expected, this implies a faster scale up will be needed in 2007 and 2008, and
full coverage could perhaps be reached by early 2009. The important point, however, is that full
coverage can be reached within approximately three years, and average annual costs between
now and 2015 are not high.

CONCLUSION
We have employed a GIS-based method to estimate the population in Africa at risk of
contracting malaria, and proceeded to calculate the cost of providing this population a
comprehensive set of interventions to reduce malaria incidence and mortality. The interventions
in our model are adjusted for urban areas and for unstable transmission areas. Although these
estimates are rough and cannot replace country-specific malaria planning and cost estimates, the
exercise shows that a GIS-based costing strategy comes up with comparable results to methods
that estimate population at risk using survey methods. In areas where survey methods may
severely underestimate population at risk, GIS-based estimates provide a useful alternative
method. Ideally, maps of malaria risk and intensity will be updated frequently in the future to
provide up-to-date estimates given the impact of interventions. Our results make it evident that
the costs of comprehensive malaria interventions are very low on a per-capita or per-patient
basis. Nevertheless, full coverage is beyond the reach of African government budgets. Given that
the disease kills millions, is readily preventable and curable, and has been shown to hamper
economic development, the international community should seize the opportunity to reduce
massively this human disease burden at such a low cost. Other public health efforts, such as
measles and polio campaigns currently underway, present an opportunity to synergize by also
delivering malaria interventions, especially bed nets.28,29
