    "abstract": "\n\nWe explore a view of the crisis as a shock to investor sentiment that led to the collapse of a bubble or pyramid scheme in financial markets. We embed this view in a standard model of the financial accelerator and explore its empirical and policy implications. In particular, we show how the model can account for: (i) a gradual and protracted expansionary phase followed by a sudden and sharp recession; (ii) the connection (or lack of connection!) between financial and real economic activity and; (iii) a fast and strong transmission of shocks across sectors and countries. We also use the model to explore the role of fiscal policy\n\n",
    "acknowledgement": "\nWe dedicate this research to the memory of Paul Samuelson, the best economist of the twentieth century, and the first one to understand that pyramid schemes are possible and might raise welfare even if we are all rational and well informed. We thank Fernando Broner and Francesco Caselli for comments on an earlier draft, and Stavros Panageas for a very helpful discussion. We also thank Robert Zymek for excellent research assistance. We acknowledge financial support from the European Research Council, the Lamfalussy Program sponsored by the European Central Bank, the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, the Generalitat de Catalunya, and the Barcelona GSE Research Network.
