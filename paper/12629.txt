JEL No. F41
ABSTRACT
We use more than one century of Argentine and Mexican data to estimate the structural parameters
of a small-open-economy real-business-cycle model driven by nonstationary productivity shocks. We
find that the RBC model does a poor job at explaining business cycles in emerging countries. We then
estimate an augmented model that incorporates shocks to the country premium and financial frictions.
We find that the estimated financial-friction model provides a remarkably good account of business
cycles in emerging markets and, importantly, assigns a negligible role to nonstationary productivity
shocks.

Introduction

Recently, a number of studies have departed from the mainstream view that in order to
explain economic fluctuations in emerging markets theoretical models must take explicitly
into account the role of policy and market failures. This line of research argues that business
cycles in emerging countries can be explained well using a neoclassical model featuring no
distortions and driven solely by shocks to total factor productivity. Finn Kydland and
Carlos Zarazaga (2002), for instance, adopt a strong view by arguing that the RBC model
can replicate satisfactorily the ‘lost decade’ of the 1980s in Argentina. More recently Mark
Aguiar and Gita Gopinath (2007) have suggested that an RBC model driven primarily by
permanent shocks to productivity can explain well business cycles in developing countries.
These authors acknowledge the fact that shocks impinging upon emerging countries are
numerous and of different natures, but argue that their combined effect can be modeled as
an aggregate shock to total factor productivity with a large nonstationary component. In
addition, they argue that the neoclassical model is an adequate framework for understanding
the transmission of such shocks.
In this paper, we undertake an investigation of the hypothesis that an RBC model driven
by a combination of permanent and transitory shocks to total factor productivity can account
satisfactorily for observed aggregate dynamics in developing countries. To this end, we
conduct an econometric estimation of the parameters of a small open economy RBC model
using Argentine and Mexican data over the period 1900-2005. Our use of long time series is
motivated by what we believe is an important drawback of existing studies advocating the
ability of the RBC model driven by permanent technology shocks to explain business cycles
in developing countries. Namely, the use of short samples both for the characterization of
observed business cycles and for the estimation of the parameters of the theoretical model,
particularly those defining the stochastic process of the nonstationary productivity shock.
We find that, when estimated over the long sample, the RBC model driven by permanent and transitory productivity shocks does a poor job at explaining observed business
cycles in Argentina and Mexico along a number of dimensions. One such dimension is the
trade-balance-to-output ratio. Specifically, the RBC model predicts that the trade balanceto-output ratio is a near random walk, with a flat autocorrelation function close to unity. By
contrast, in the data, the highest autocorrelation coefficient of the trade balance-to-output
ratio takes place at the first order and is less than 0.6, with higher-order autocorrelations
converging quickly to zero. In addition, we find that the RBC model fails to match several
other important features of the business cycle in emerging countries. In particular, in Argentina and Mexico, as well as in many other emerging countries, consumption is significantly

1

more volatile than output. The RBC model fails to capture the observed excess volatility in
consumption, and in the case of Mexico it actually predicts consumption to be significantly
less volatile than output. Also, the model predicts the trade balance to be significantly more
volatile than its corresponding empirical counterpart. Furthermore, the RBC model does
poorly at matching the correlation of the trade balance with the domestic components of
aggregate absorption.
To gauge the role of nonstationary productivity shocks in explaining business cycles
in emerging countries, we estimate using Bayesian methods an augmented version of the
baseline RBC model that incorporates preference shocks, country-premium shocks and a
realistic debt elasticity of the country premium. The latter two features are meant to capture
in a simplified form an economy facing international financial frictions. We find that the
augmented model mimics remarkably well the observed business cycles in Argentina over the
period 1900-2005. In particular, the model replicates the downward-sloping autocorrelation
function of the trade-balance-to-output ratio, the excess volatility of consumption, the high
volatility of investment, and a volatility of the trade-balance-to-output ratio comparable
to that of output growth. Importantly, the estimated model assigns a negligible role to
permanent productivity shocks lending little support to the hypothesis that the cycle is the
trend.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 analyzes empirical regularities of business cycles in emerging countries. It argues that, contrary to the moderation that
took place in developed countries after the second world war, the amplitude and frequency
of business cycles in emerging countries has been stable over the past century. Section
3 presents the RBC model. Section 4 describes the econometric estimation of the model
using Bayesian methods and Argentine data from 1900 to 2005. It also evaluates the performance of the RBC model. Section 5 develops, estimates, and evaluates a version of the
model that incorporates financial frictions, country spread shocks, preference shocks, and
domestic-spending shocks. Section 6 estimates the model using Mexican data over the period 1900-2005 and relates the results to those obtained in the related literature that uses
shorter samples. Section 7 concludes.

Business Cycles in Emerging Countries: 1900-2005

Our joint analysis of pre- and post-world-war-two data represents a departure from the
usual practice in studies of the developed-country business cycle. Typically, these studies
concentrate either on the pre-world-war-two period—often emphasizing the Great Depression
years—or on the post-world-war-two period—as do most of the many papers spurred by the
2

work of Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott (1982). There is a good reason for separating
the pre- and post-world-war-two periods when examining developed-country data. For the
volatility of business cycles in industrialized countries fell significantly in the second half
of the twentieth century. In sharp contrast, in emerging countries business cycles do not
appear to moderate after the second world war. This fact is clearly illustrated in figure 1,
which depicts the evolution of output in Argentina (panel a) and the United States (panel
b) over the period 1900-2005. Data sources are presented in the appendix. The figure shows
with solid lines the logarithm of GDP per capita and with broken lines the associated cubic
trend. In the United States, the first half of the twentieth century is dominated by the Great
Depression and appears as highly volatile. By comparison, the half century following the end
of World War II appears as fairly calm, with output evolving smoothly around its long-run
trend. On the other hand, in Argentina output fluctuations appear equally volatile in the
prewar period as in the postwar period.1 More specifically, over the period 1900-2005 the
United States and Argentina display similar volatilities in per-capita output growth of about
5 percent. However, in the United States the volatility of output growth falls significantly
from 6.4 percent in the prewar period to 3.4 percent in the postwar period. By contrast, in
Argentina the volatility of output growth falls insignificantly from 5.7 in the earlier half of
the twentieth century to 5.2 percent in the later half.
The patterns of aggregate volatility observed in Argentina and the United States extend
to larger sets of developed and emerging countries. Figure 2 displays the cyclical component
of the log of real GDP per capita for seven Latin American countries and thirteen small
developed countries over the period 1900-2005. In the figure, the cycle is computed as
percent deviations of GDP from a cubic trend. Three main conclusions emerge from the
data presented in figure 2. First, over the period 1900-2005, business cycles are equally
volatile in the group of Latin American countries as in the group of developed countries.
The average standard deviation of detrended output is about 10 percent for both groups.
Second, in the group of Latin American economies, business cycles are as volatile in the
period 1900-1945 as in the period 1946-2005, with average standard deviations of 10.1 and
9.8 percent, respectively. By contrast, in the group of developed countries business cycles are
significantly more volatile in the period 1900-1945 than in the period 1946-2005, with average
standard deviations of 12.7 percent versus 7.2 percent, respectively. Third, the period 19801

Susanto Basu and Alan M. Taylor (1999) also find no differences in output volatility in Argentina in
the prewar and postwar eras (see their table A3). Using data from Argentina for the period 1884 to 1990,
Adolfo Sturzenegger and Ramiro Moya (2003) find that business cycles in the pre world war II period were
more volatile than in the postwar period. This different result is due to the fact that their sample does not
include the years 1991-2005, which are among the most volatile of the postwar era and that their sample
includes the period 1884-1900, which was particularly volatile (see Basu and Taylor, 1999, table A3).

2005 contains only between one and a half and two cycles for most of the Latin American
economies included in the figure. This fact suggests that if one is to uncover the importance
of permanent productivity shocks as drivers of business cycles in emerging countries , limiting
the empirical analysis to the post 1980 period—as do many recent related studies—may be
problematic. The empirical evidence presented thus far serves as motivation for our focus
on a long sample for the analysis of business cycles in emerging countries.

2.1

The Autocorrelation Function of the Trade-Balance-To-Output
Ratio

At center stage in virtually every study of the business cycle in emerging economies is
the trade balance. Examples of strands of the literature in which this variable features
prominently include the literatures on balance of payments crises, sudden stops, sovereign
debt, and exchange-rate-based stabilization. One reason for the interest in understanding the
behavior of this variable is that typically the onset of economic crises in emerging countries
are characterized by large reversals in the trade balance. It is therefore natural to ask
whether the RBC model can capture observed movements of the trade balance over the
business cycle. More specifically, one of the dimensions along which we will scrutinize the
empirical performance of the RBC model is the autocorrelation function of the trade-balanceto-output ratio.
Figure 3 displays the autocorrelation function of the trade-balance-to-output ratio of
sixteen emerging countries. Although there is some variation across countries, the pattern
that emerges is that of a downward-sloping function with a first-order autocorrelation of
about 0.65 and that approaches zero monotonically at the fourth or fifth order.

2.2

Second Moments: Argentina 1900-2005

Table 1 displays empirical second moments of output growth, consumption growth, investment growth, and the trade-balance-to-output ratio for Argentina over the period 1900-2005.
Argentina is one of two countries for which we constructed long time series for the four variables considered in the table. The other country is Mexico, which we analyze in section 6.
Notably, unlike in developed countries, per-capita consumption growth in Argentina is
significantly more volatile than per-capita output growth. The excess volatility of consumption relative to output is more than two percentage points. Others have documented this fact
for Argentina and other emerging countries using post-1980 data (Pablo A. Neumeyer and
Fabrizio Perri, 2006, Aguiar and Gopinath, 2007, and Martı́n Uribe, 2006). Here, we show
that the high volatility of consumption relative to output remains present after augmenting

the sample to include the first three quarters of the twentieth century. Gross investment
growth is enormously volatile. Its standard deviation is about four times as large as that
of output growth. At the same time, the trade balance-to-output ratio is about as volatile
as output growth. The observed correlation between the trade balance-to-output ratio and
output growth is negative but insignificantly different from zero. By contrast the domestic
components of aggregate demand, private consumption growth and investment growth, are
significantly negatively correlated with the trade balance. Finally, the bottom row of table 1
shows that the first-order autocorrelation of output growth is positive but small and not
significantly different from zero.

The RBC Model

The theoretical framework is the small open economy model presented in Stephanie SchmittGrohé and Uribe (2003) augmented with permanent productivity shocks as in Aguiar and
Gopinath (2007). The production technology takes the form
Yt = at Ktα (Xt ht )1−α ,

(1)

where Yt denotes output in period t, Kt denotes capital in period t, ht denotes hours worked in
period t, and at and Xt represent productivity shocks. Our interpretation of these two sources
of aggregate volatility is not limited to exogenous variations in technology, but includes other
8

disturbances that may affect total factor productivity, such as terms-of-trade shocks. We
use upper case letters to denote variables that contain a trend in equilibrium, and lower case
letters to denote variables that do not contain a trend in equilibrium.
The productivity shock at is assumed to follow a first-order autoregressive process in logs.
That is,
ln at+1 = ρa ln at + at+1 ;

at ∼ N (0, σa2 ).

The productivity shock Xt is nonstationary. Let
gt ≡

Xt
Xt−1

denote the gross growth rate of Xt . We assume that the logarithm of gt follows a first-order
autoregressive process of the form
ln(gt+1 /g) = ρg ln(gt /g) + gt+1 ;

gt ∼ N (0, σg2 ).

The parameter g measures the deterministic gross growth rate of the productivity factor Xt .
The parameters ρa , ρg ∈ [0, 1) govern the persistence of at and gt , respectively.

where Dt+1 denotes the stock of debt acquired in period t, rt denotes the domestic interest
rate on bonds held between periods t and t + 1, Ct denotes consumption, It denotes gross
investment, and the parameter φ introduces quadratic capital adjustment costs. The capital
stock evolves according to the following law of motion:
Kt+1 = (1 − δ)Kt + It ,

(3)

where δ ∈ [0, 1) denotes the depreciation rate of capital.
In order to induce independence of the deterministic steady state from initial conditions,
we assume that the country faces a debt-elastic interest-rate premium as in Schmitt-Grohé
and Uribe (2003). Specifically, the domestic interest rate is assumed to be the sum of the
world interest rate r∗ > 0, assumed to be constant, and a country premium that is increasing
in a detrended measure of aggregate debt as follows:

Estimation and Evaluation of the RBC Model: Argentina 1900-2005

The time unit in the model is meant to be a year. We assign values to the structural
parameters using a combination of calibration and econometric estimation techniques.
¯ θ, ω, and γ using long-run data relations from
We calibrate the parameters α, δ, ψ, d,
Argentina as well as parameter values that are common in related business-cycle studies.
Table 2 presents the calibrated parameter values. We set the parameter d¯ to induce a small
steady-state trade balance-to-output ratio of about 0.25 percent, as observed on average
in Argentina over the period 1900-2005. We follow Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2003) and
assign a small value to the parameter ψ, measuring the sensitivity of the country interestrate premium to deviations of external debt from trend, with the sole purpose of ensuring
independence of the deterministic steady state from initial conditions, without affecting the
short-run dynamics of the model. The value assigned to the depreciation rate δ implies
an average investment ratio of about 19 percent, which is in line with the average value
observed in Argentina between 1900 and 2005. The value assumed for the discount factor
β implies a relatively high average real interest rate of about 8.5 percent per annum, which
is empirically plausible for an emerging market like Argentina. There is no reliable data on
10

factor income shares for Argentina. We therefore set the parameter α, which determines
the average capital income share, at 0.32, a value commonly used in the related literature.
We set θ = 2.24, to ensure that in the steady state households allocate about 20 percent of
their time to market work. The parameter γ, defining the curvature of the period utility
function, takes the value 2, which is standard in related business-cycle studies. Finally, ω
is calibrated at 1.6, which implies a labor-supply elasticity of 1/(ω − 1) = 1.7. This value
is frequently used in calibrated versions of small open economy models (see Mendoza, 1991;
and Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2003).
We estimate the remaining parameters of the model using Bayesian methods and Argentine data on output growth, consumption growth, investment growth, and the tradebalance-to-output ratio over the period 1900-2005. Specifically, we estimate six structural
parameters, namely, the five parameters defining the stochastic process of the productivity
shocks, g, σg , ρg , σa , and ρa and the parameter governing the degree of capital adjustment
costs, φ. We also estimate four nonstructural parameters representing the standard deviations of i.i.d. measurement errors on the observables, σy , σc , σi , and σtby . We impose uniform
prior distributions on all estimated parameters. Measurement errors are permitted to absorb
no more than 6 percent of the variance of the corresponding observable time series. Table 3
presents key statistics of the prior and posterior distributions. The reported posterior statistics are computed from a two-million MCMC chain from which the first one million draws
were discarded. The estimation delivers quite persistent processes for both productivity
shocks (i.e., high values of ρg and ρa ) and a relatively large value for the adjustment-cost
parameter φ.

The Performance of the RBC Model

Figure 4 displays with a circled line the autocorrelation functions of the trade balance-tooutput ratio implied by the RBC model. To facilitate comparison with the data, the figure
reproduces with a solid line the corresponding estimated autocorrelation function, and with
broken lines a two-standard-deviation confidence interval around the point estimate. All
four autocorrelations predicted by the RBC model take values close to unity, indicating that
in the model the trade balance-to-output ratio behaves as a near random walk. By contrast,
the empirical autocorrelation function takes a value slightly below 0.6 at order one and
then declines quickly toward zero, resembling a variable with a stationary autoregressive
behavior. Further, the theoretical autocorrelation function lies entirely outside the twostandard-deviation band around the empirical point estimate.
The result that the autocorrelation function of the trade balance to output ratio pre-

Note: Estimation is based on Argentine data from 1900 to 2005. All prior distributions
are uniform. Posterior statistics are based on a two-million MCMC chain from which
the first million draws were discarded. The upper bound of the prior distributions
of the standard deviations of measurement errors equal 25 percent of the standard
deviation of the corresponding empirical time series. The log-marginal likelihood was
computed using Geweke’s modified harmonic mean method with truncation parameter

dicted by the RBC model is flat and close to unity is not a consequence of the presence of
nonstationary productivity shocks. Specifically, shutting off the nonstationary productivity
shock in the RBC model by setting σg equal to zero and keeping all other parameter values unchanged results in an autocorrelation function that is virtually identical to the one
shown with a circled line in figure 4. Given our parameterization of the RBC model, the
flat nature of the trade-balance-to-output ratio reflects the endogenous random walk of consumption typical of small open economies with incomplete asset markets. Our RBC model
does not generate an exact endogenous random walk in consumption because we incorporate a small debt elasticity of the country interest rate (governed by the parameter ψ) that
induces stationarity. However, because the debt-elasticity of the country premium is small,
consumption is highly persistent in equilibrium. In general, however, the value assigned to
the parameter ψ is not the only determinant of the shape of the autocorrelation function of
the trade-balance-to-output ratio in the small open economy RBC model. In effect, given the
value of ψ, the values assigned to other parameters (such as the degree of capital adjustment
costs or the persistence of the stationary productivity shock, among others) can deliver a low
and downward sloping autocorrelation function of the trade-balance-to-output ratio. This is
the case, for instance in the RBC model analyzed by Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2003). The
Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe model is of particular interest for the present discussion because it
features the same value of ψ as the one used in our parameterization of the RBC model, but

13

different values for other structural parameters. However, an autocorrelation of the tradebalance-to-output ratio that is flat and close to unity is a robust prediction of the small
open economy RBC model in the following sense: Given the values of all other structural
parameters of the model, there exists a small enough value of the parameter ψ, governing
the debt-sensitivity of the country premium, that, up to first order, ensures stationarity of
the equilibrium dynamics and at the same time delivers an autocorrelation function of the
trade-balance-to-output ratio that is flat and close to unity.
One way to eliminate the near random walk behavior of the trade balance is to introduce financial imperfections as in the sovereign debt literature. In such environments trade
deficits that result in increases in the net foreign debt position cause increases in the country
premium, because, for instance, of elevated risks of default. In turn, larger country premia
tend to incentivate domestic savings and discourage private investment, thereby dampening
the increase in trade deficits. An ad-hoc way of capturing this channel in the context of
the present model would be to sufficiently raise the value of the parameter ψ governing the
debt-elasticity of the country premium. By placing financial frictions at center stage, however, this type of transmission mechanism would represent a significant departure from the
RBC paradigm. We explore the empirical relevance of financial frictions in section 5. Alternatively, a downward-sloping autocorrelation function of the trade-balance-to-output ratio
could be obtained by adopting a sufficiently elastic subjective discount factor with respect
to consumption or a sufficiently large cost of adjusting the net foreign asset position. Again,
assigning to any of these avenues a role larger than that of merely inducing stationarity,
would imply a departure from the RBC paradigm.
Table 4 reports second moments implied by the RBC model. To facilitate comparison,
the table reproduces the empirical counterparts and their associated standard errors from
table 1. In the RBC model, consumption growth is slightly more volatile than output growth.
This prediction is qualitatively in line with the data, but falls short quantitatively, as the
RBC model predicts the excess volatility of consumption to be about half a percentage point,
whereas in the data it is more than two percentage points. The insufficient excess volatility
of consumption comes about not because consumption is predicted to be too smooth, but
because output is predicted to be too volatile. In effect, the RBC model overestimates the
volatility of output growth by about 2 percentage points. More importantly, the modest
excess volatility of consumption predicted by the RBC model comes at the cost of an enormous implied volatility of the trade balance to output ratio of about twenty times the value
observed in the data.
To a large extent, both the excess volatility of consumption relative to output and the
volatility of the trade-balance-to-output ratio are the consequence of a high estimated value

for the parameter ρg , measuring the persistence of the growth rate of the nonstationary
component of total factor productivity, Xt /Xt−1 . In effect, if one lowers the value of ρg
from its posterior median level of 0.82 to 0 holding all other parameter values equal (so
that the growth rate of the nonstationary component of productivity becomes both less
persistent and unconditionally less volatile), consumption becomes significantly less volatile
than output and the trade-balance-to-output ratio becomes about eighty percentage points
less volatile (although still several times more volatile than in the data). The intuition
behind this result is as follows. When the growth rate of the nonstationary component of
productivity is highly persistent, a positive permanent innovation in productivity (gt > 0)
generates positive growth rates in productivity not only in the current period but also in the
future. As a consequence, the trend level of productivity becomes steeper. Faced with this
upward-sloping revision in the path of productivity, agents decide to smooth consumption
by borrowing against future income. Thus, current consumption increases beyond current
output and the trade balance deteriorates. So the volatilities of consumption growth and the
trade balance move hand in hand with changes in the persistence of productivity growth.
This is problematic because although a reduction in ρg improves the performance of the
RBC model by making the trade balance less volatile, it worsens its performance by making
consumption less volatile relative to output.
The intuition provided in the previous paragraph suggests that another parameter that
may play a significant role in determining both the excess volatility of consumption and the
volatility of the trade balance is σg , the standard deviation of the innovation in the growth
rate of the nonstationary component of productivity. This is indeed the case. Shutting
off the nonstationary productivity shock by setting σg equal to zero lowers the volatility of
the trade-balance-to-output ratio to about 25 percent but it also results in a volatility of
consumption growth significantly lower than that of output growth. As in the case of ρg ,
lowering σg improves the performance of the RBC model along one dimension (the volatility
of the trade balance) but in detriment of another important dimension (the excess volatility
of consumption relative to output).
The RBC model significantly underpredicts the volatility of gross investment (12.9 in the
model versus 20.4 percent in the data). A higher volatility of the nonstationary productivity
shock would contribute to narrowing this difference, but at the expense of exacerbating the
immense overestimation of the volatility of the trade-balance-to-output ratio.
Finally, the RBC model correctly predicts a near-zero correlation between output growth
and the trade balance-to-output ratio. However, it significantly underpredicts the negative
correlations of the trade-balance-to-output ratio with consumption growth and investment
growth. The fact that the trade-balance share is more correlated with the domestic com16

ponents of aggregate demand than with output growth may be an indication that shocks
other than movements in total factor productivity could be playing a role in driving business
cycles in Argentina. We explore this possibility next..

Financial Frictions and Country-Spread Shocks

The goal of this section is to build and estimate a model in which the sources of uncertainty
and the transmission mechanism invoked by the RBC model compete with additional shocks
and frictions. To this end, we augment the RBC model with a simple form of financial
friction, and with shocks to the country premium and to domestic absorption. Specifically,
we now allow the parameter ψ, governing the debt elasticity of the country premium, to
be econometrically estimated, rather than fixing it at a small number. In this way, the
role of the debt elasticity of the country premium is no longer limited to simply inducing
stationarity, but to potentially act as the reduced form of a financial friction shaping the
model’s response to aggregate disturbances. The additional sources of uncertainty include
a domestic preference shock, a spending shock, which may be interpreted as a government
purchases shock, and a country premium shock. We interpret the shock to the country
premium as possibly stemming from financial imperfections that open the door to stochastic
shifts in the country premium that are uncorrelated with the state of domestic fundamentals.
Uribe and Vivian Yue (2006) find that this type of disturbance explain about two thirds of
movements in country premia in emerging countries. To distinguish it from the standard
RBC model studied thus far, we will refer to the model presented in this section as a ‘model
with financial frictions.’

All other elements of the model, including the production technology, the evolution of the
stationary and nonstationary productivity shocks, and the evolution of the capital stock
are as in the baseline RBC model presented above. Note that the present model nests the
baseline RBC model of section 3.
We estimate the model using Bayesian methods and Argentine data on output growth,
consumption growth, investment growth, and the trade-balance-to-output ratio over the
period 1900-2005. We estimate 13 structural parameters, σg , ρg , σa , ρa , σν , ρν , σs , ρs ,
σµ , ρµ , φ, ψ, and g, and 4 nonstructural parameters representing the standard deviations
of i.i.d. measurement errors on the observables, σy , σc , σi , and σtby . We impose uniform
prior distributions on all estimated parameters. Table 3 shows key statistics of the prior and
posterior distributions. We highlight the following features: First, the posterior distributions
of the parameters σg and ρg defining the nonstationary productivity shock are quite disperse,
with 90-percent probability intervals of (0.0006, 0.03) and (−0.66, 0.83), respectively. This
result suggest a weak identification of the trend shock to productivity. Second, the median of
σg takes the value 0.007, which is four times smaller than the corresponding point estimate
in the baseline RBC model, suggesting a reduced importance of the permanent technology
shock under the present specification. Third, the estimated distribution of the parameter
ψ implies a high sensitivity of the country premium to the level of external debt. The
posterior median of this parameter is estimated to be 2.8, which implies that if the stock of
external debt increases by one percentage point of GDP then the country premium increases
by over half a percentage point. This finding indicates that the data assign a nonnegligible
role to financial frictions. Fourth, the estimated volatility of the country-premium shock
is large. The median value of σµ of 0.056 implies that a one-standard-deviation innovation
in µt raises the interest rate at which the country borrows from world financial markets by
about 5 percentage points. The bottom panel of table 3 presents the log-marginal likelihoods
associated with the RBC and financial-friction models. These statistics indicates that the

18

data favor the financial-friction model over the RBC specification.
Figure 4 displays with a crossed line the autocorrelation function of the trade-balanceto-output ratio predicted by the model. In producing this autocorrelation function, the
structural parameters are set at the median of their posterior distributions. The figure
shows that the model augmented with financial frictions is highly successful at replicating
the downward-sloping autocorrelation function of the trade-balance-to-output ratio observed
in Argentina over the period 1900-2005. This success is due to three features of the model.
One is the financial friction captured by the parameter ψ, governing the sensitivity of the
country premium to movements in the stock of external debt. When ψ is relatively high,
deviations of the trade-balance ratio below its long-run level cause the external debt to
increase, which, by the presence of a debt-elastic interest-rate premium, produces a rise in
the country interest rate. In turn, elevated interest rates tend to curb the growth rates of
consumption and investment, thereby inducing the trade balance to revert to its long-run
level. A similar intuition applies to deviations of the trade-balance ratio above its long-run
level. It follows that the larger is ψ the more trend reverting is the trade-balance ratio,
and therefore the more downward-sloping is its autocorrelation function. Indeed, lowering
the value of ψ from its median value of 2.8 to the small value of 0.001 imposed in the
calibration of the baseline RBC model causes the autocorrelation function of the tradebalance-to-output ratio to become flat and close to unity as in the RBC model. The other
two elements of the model that are important in mimicking the observed autocorrelation
function of the trade-balance-to-output ratio are country-premium shocks and preference
shocks. Shutting down these two shocks by setting σµ = σν = 0, while keeping all other
parameter values at their posterior medians, causes the autocorrelation function of the tradebalance-to-output ratio to lie entirely above the upper limit of the two-standard-error band
around the empirical point estimate. On the other hand, productivity shocks are not essential
for the model’s ability to match the autocorrelation function of the trade-balance-to-output
ratio. In effect, shutting off both productivity shocks by setting σg = σa = 0 one obtains a
predicted autocorrelation function of the trade-balance-to-output ratio that matches quite
well its empirical counterpart.
Table 4 displays second moments predicted by the model with financial frictions. The
table shows that the augmented model overcomes a number of difficulties faced by the
RBC model. First, the model with financial frictions captures the fact that in Argentina
over the period 1900-2005, as in most other developing countries, consumption growth is
significantly more volatile than output growth. Specifically, in accordance with the data,
the financial-friction model predicts that consumption is about 2 percentage points more
volatile than output. By contrast, the RBC model predicts that the excess volatility of
19

consumption is less than half a percentage point. In the financial-friction model the bulk of
the predicted excess volatility of consumption is explained not by nonstationary productivity
shocks—as maintained by the hypothesis that ‘the cycle is the trend’—but by domestic
preference shocks. This observation will become apparent shortly when we present predicted
variance decompositions. Second, the model with financial frictions corrects the RBC model’s
severe overestimation of the volatility of the trade-balance-to-output ratio as well as the
underestimation of the volatility of investment growth. Finally, as in the data, the model
with financial frictions predicts a significant negative correlation of the trade-balance ratio
with consumption and investment growth. By contrast, the RBC model predicts virtually
no correlation between the trade balance and the components of domestic absorption.

tions. The most remarkable result that emerges from this exercise is that the contribution of
nonstationary productivity shocks to business cycles is predicted to be virtually nil. That is,
the model gives little credence to the hypothesis that ‘the cycle is the trend.’ This result is in
line with the findings of Javier Garcı́a-Cicco (2008), in the context of a model with a richer
set of shocks and frictions and using the same set of observables, and Roberto Chang and
Andrés Fernandez (2008), in a model with additional financial frictions and using Mexican
data post 1980. By contrast, the stationary component of total factor productivity explains
most of the predicted movements in output growth.
20

Disturbances in productivity, whether permanent or temporary, play virtually no role in
explaining movements in investment growth or the trade balance-to-output ratio. These two
variables are to a large extent driven by innovations in country interest rates. In addition,
private consumption growth is explained in equal parts by domestic preference shocks and
stationary productivity shocks. Importantly, preference shocks are responsible for most
of the excess volatility of consumption growth over output growth. This result is in stark
contrast with the hypothesis according to which the excess volatility of consumption observed
in emerging countries is due to permanent movements in productivity. Finally, domestic
spending shocks are estimated to have a negligible role in explaining business cycles.

Mexico 1900-2005

The case of Mexico is of interest because it has been used in earlier studies to test the
potential of the RBC model driven by trend shocks to productivity to explain business
cycles in emerging countries. We begin by estimating the RBC model using a long annual
sample of Mexican data ranging from 1900 to 2005. We then compare the results with those
obtained in related studies that use shorter samples for the estimation and the evaluation of
the RBC model. To make the comparison with related studies a step closer, we estimate the
model by GMM. Specifically, we estimate the parameters g, σg , ρg , σa , ρa , and φ of the RBC
model using annual data on output growth, consumption growth, investment growth, and
the trade-balance-to-output ratio from Mexico over the period 1900-2005 (see the appendix
for data sources). In the GMM estimation, we include 16 moment conditions: the variances
and first- and second-order autocorrelations of output growth (g Y ), consumption growth
(g C ), investment growth (g I ), and the trade balance-to-output ratio, (tby), the correlation
of g Y with g C , g I , and tby, and the unconditional mean of g Y . (See Garcı́a-Cicco, Pancrazi,
and Uribe, 2009, for more details.)
All calibrated parameters are set as in the Argentine case (table 2), except for d and
δ, which were set at 0.05 and 0.082, respectively, to match the Mexican average tradebalance-to-GDP ratio (1.25 percent) and average investment-to-GDP ratio (14.7) over the
sample period. Table 6 displays point estimates and associated standard errors of the six
structural parameters estimated by GMM. Table 7 displays empirical and theoretical second
moments. The RBC model estimated using Mexican data counterfactually predicts that
output is more volatile than consumption. In addition, the model overpredicts the volatilities
of investment and the trade balance and underpredicts the volatility of consumption. The
high volatility of investment growth predicted by the model is a consequence of the fact that
the GMM estimate of the parameter φ governing the degree of capital adjustment costs is

virtually zero. The model also overestimates the cyclicalities of consumption and the trade
balance and overestimates the cyclicality of investment. Further, the RBC model severely
underestimates the serial correlations of output, consumption, and investment. The model
predicts a first-order autocorrelation of the trade-balance-to-output ratio significantly less
than unity and close to its empirical counterpart. This result is due to the behavior of gross
investment. The virtual absence of adjustment costs induces firms to bunch investment
rather than spread this type of expenditure over time. As a result, investment growth is
highly negatively serially correlated. In turn, the negative serial correlation of investment
growth has a depressing effect on the first-order serial correlation of the trade balance.
However, this effect represents only a parallel downward shift in the autocorrelation function
of the trade balance, which is counterfactually flat. This point is conveyed graphically by
figure 5, which shows that the autocorrelation function of the trade balance predicted by the

model starts at around 0.6 but, is flat (indeed slightly increasing). To highlight the flatness
of the predicted autocorrelation function of the trade-balance-to-output ratio, the figure
displays autocorrelations up to order 10. However, the theoretical autocorrelation function
remains above 0.6 way beyond order 100. By contrast, the empirical autocorrelation function
is strictly decreasing and converges relatively quickly to zero.
We conclude that the RBC model with nonstationary productivity shocks does a poor
23

job at matching the Mexican business cycle over the period 1900-2005. This result is in stark
contrast with the findings of Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) (henceforth AG), namely, that the
RBC model driven by permanent shifts to productivity performs well over the shorter period
1980-2003. Why does the RBC model do a good job at matching the short-sample moments
but a poor job at matching the long-sample moments? We begin to address this question by
establishing that the different results are not due to the application of different econometric
techniques in the AG paper and in the present study. This first step is in order because,
unlike AG, and guided by our reading of the econometric literature on GMM estimation of
business-cycle models with persistent time series, we HP filter neither the empirical nor the
theoretical data before estimation. Instead, our estimation procedure uses growth rates of
output, consumption, and investment and the trade-balance-to-output ratio. Accordingly,
we estimate the RBC model employing the same data set used by AG (a quarterly sample
of Mexican data covering the period 1980:Q1 to 2003:Q2), but applying the same GMM
technique we used to estimate the model over the sample 1900-2005. We find that over the
shorter sample the fit of the RBC model increases significantly. In particular, the model
matches the volatilities of output, consumption, and the trade balance quite well. We note
especially that the model predicts consumption to be as volatile as output. It overestimates
the volatility of investment, but not significantly. Finally, the model estimated over a short
sample does a good job at replicating the observed autocorrelation function of the tradebalance-to-output ratio up to the fourth order. (Details of this estimation exercise are
available at Garcı́a-Cicco, Pancrazi, and Uribe, 2009.) This result demonstrates that it is
not differences in econometric techniques applied in the AG paper and in our paper that
account for our finding that the RBC model performs significantly worse over the long
sample.
A salient feature of the Mexican data that is to a large extent responsible for the better
fit of the RBC model over the short sample than over the long sample is the higher volatility
of consumption relative to output over the long sample. In effect, over the period 1900-2005,
consumption growth was almost 50 percent more volatile than output growth, whereas over
the shorter period 1980-2003 it was less than 25 percent more volatile than output growth.
If appropriately parameterized, the RBC model driven by trend shocks to productivity can
indeed generate high relative volatility of consumption. We showed earlier in the paper that
this can be achieved by raising the persistence and/or the volatility of the nonstationary
productivity shock. However, a byproduct of doing this is a higher implied volatility of
the trade-balance-to-output ratio. This would not be a problem if the longer sample were
characterized by a relatively more volatile trade-balance-to-output ratio than is the short
sample. But this is not the case. On the contrary, over the period 1900-2005, the trade24

balance-to-output ratio was actually less volatile than output growth, whereas over the
period 1980-2003 it was 15 percent more volatile than output growth.2 A natural question
is therefore whether the long sample or the short sample is more suitable for characterizing
business cycles in emerging countries. In section 2 of the paper, we show that for most
Latin American economies the period 1980 to 2003 contains only one and a half to two
business cycles, whereas the sample period 1900 to 2005 that we consider contains about
nine business cycles. There, we also argue that the amplitude and frequency of business
cycles in emerging countries has been stable over the past century. Taken together, these
observations suggest that the long sample is more representative of business-cycle regularities
in emerging countries than is the short sample.
One might argue that an advantage of using a relatively short sample is the possibility
of picking a period of relative stability in macroeconomic policy. Arguably, a time span in
which policy has been stable could be a more fertile ground for testing the explanatory power
of an RBC model—in which, by design, government intervention is completely absent—than
a period characterized by frequent policy regime switches. Stability is, however, hardly a
characteristic of Mexican macroeconomic policy over the period 1980 to 2003. We briefly
point out three policy areas along which Mexico experienced major swings over the period
in question. One is financial regulation. The Mexican financial sector was relatively unregulated until 1982 when, in response to the developing-country debt crisis, the government
applied severe financial repression, which included the nationalization of the banking sector.
Financial policy changed again in the mid 1980s, when these regulations were removed. A
second source of policy heterogeneity during this period was monetary policy. High inflation
during the period 1982-1987 was followed, as a result of an exchange-rate-based stabilization
program, by a period of relative price stability over the period 1987-1994. The so called
Tequila crisis rendered the antiinflationary policy unsustainable, causing a resumption of
high inflation in 1995 and 1996, which was gradually brought down afterwards. Finally,
Mexico also experienced significant changes in trade policy over the period 1980-2003. Until
1985 trade policy displayed a marked protectionist bias. Beginning in 1985, the country
engaged in a gradual process of opening to international trade that culminated in the early
1990s with the signing of the North America Free Trade Agreement with the United States
and Canada.

Conclusion

The present study scrutinizes the hypothesis that business cycles in developing economies
are driven by permanent and/or transitory exogenous shifts in total factor productivity and
transmitted through the familiar mechanism of the frictionless RBC model.
The starting point of our investigation is the notion that if permanent shocks are to play
an important role in the macroeconomy, then long time series are called both for characterizing business cycles, as well as for identifying the parameters defining the stochastic processes
of the underlying shocks. Accordingly, we build a data set covering more than a century of
aggregate data from Argentina and Mexico. We use these data to estimate a battery of statistics that provide a fairly complete picture of the Argentine and Mexican business cycles.
We then formulate a standard RBC model of the small open economy driven by permanent
and transitory productivity shocks. We estimate the parameters of these productivity shock
processes and other structural parameters of the model using our data from Argentina and
Mexico.
Comparing the predictions of the model with the data, we arrive at the conclusion that
the RBC model does a poor job at explaining business cycles in Argentina and Mexico. One
dimension along which the RBC model fails to explain the data is the trade-balance-to-output
ratio. In the model, the trade balance-to-output ratio follows a near random walk, with a flat
autocorrelation function that is flat and close to one. In the data, the autocorrelation of the
trade-balance share is far below unity and converges quickly to zero. Another challenge for
the RBC model is the empirical fact that in Argentina and Mexico, as in many other emerging
countries, private consumption growth is significantly more volatile than output growth. In
both Argentina and Mexico consumption growth is about two percentage points more volatile
than output growth. By contrast, the RBC model predicts that consumption growth is less
than half a percentage point more volatile than output growth in the case of Argentina
and actually less volatile than output growth in the case of Mexico. In order for the RBC
model to generate a realistically amount of excess consumption volatility, permanent shocks
to productivity must be sufficiently predominant. Our estimates do not assign permanent
shocks this predominance. On the other hand, there is a sense in which permanent shocks
are too volatile in the model. In effect, the model predicts a volatility of the trade-balanceto-output ratio that is twenty times as large as in the data in the case of Argentina and twice
as large in the case of Mexico.
Taken together, our findings suggest that the RBC model driven by productivity shocks
does not provide an adequate explanation of business cycles in emerging countries. We further test this conclusion by estimating, using Bayesian methods and the Argentine data set,

26

an augmented version of the RBC model that incorporates an empirically realistic debt elasticity of the country premium—which aims to capture in a reduced-form fashion the presence
of financial frictions—and three additional sources of uncertainty: country-premium shocks,
preference shocks, and domestic spending shocks. The augmented model does a remarkable
job at explaining the Argentine business cycle. In particular, the model delivers a downwardsloping autocorrelation function of the trade-balance-to-output ratio, excess volatility of
consumption, a high volatility of investment, and a volatility of the trade-balance-to-output
ratio similar to that of output growth. More importantly, the model predicts that permanent productivity shocks explain a negligible fraction of aggregate fluctuations, giving little
support to the hypothesis that the cycle is the trend. We interpret these results as suggesting that a promising area for future research is to formulate, estimate, and quantitatively
evaluate dynamic stochastic models of the emerging economy with microfounded financial
imperfections.
