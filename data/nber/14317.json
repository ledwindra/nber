    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper reviews evidence on age discrimination in U.S. labor markets and on the effects of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) in combating this discrimination.  It focuses on the challenge of population aging facing the U.S. economy in coming decades.  Combating age discrimination is likely to help in meeting this challenge by encouraging employment of older individuals.  But the paper also explores how rapid aging of the population protected by the ADEA might inhibit the ADEA's effectiveness, and raises questions about possible changes in age discrimination policies and enforcement that could enhance the ability of the ADEA to mitigate some of the adverse consequences of population aging.\n\n",
