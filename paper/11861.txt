Can Standard Preferences Explain the Prices of out of the Money S&P 500 Put Options

ABSTRACT
Prior to the stock market crash of 1987, Black-Scholes implied volatilities of S&P 500 index options
were relatively constant across moneyness. Since the crash, however, deep out-of-the-money S&P
500 put options have become ‘expensive’ relative to the Black-Scholes benchmark. Many
researchers (e.g., Liu, Pan and Wang (2005)) have argued that such prices cannot be justified in a
general equilibrium setting if the representative agent has ‘standard preferences’ and the endowment
is an i.i.d. process. Below, however, we use the insight of Bansal and Yaron (2004) to demonstrate
that the ‘volatility smirk’ can be rationalized if the agent is endowed with Epstein-Zin preferences
and if the aggregate dividend and consumption processes are driven by a persistent stochastic growth
variable that can jump. We identify a realistic calibration of the model that simultaneously matches
the empirical properties of dividends, the equity premium, the prices of both at-the-money and deep
out-of-the-money puts, and the level of the risk-free rate. A more challenging question (that to our
knowledge has not been previously investigated) is whether one can explain within a standard
preference framework the stark regime change in the volatility smirk that has maintained since the
1987 market crash. To this end, we extend the model to a Bayesian setting in which the agent
updates her beliefs about the average jump size in the event of a jump. Note that such beliefs only
update at crash dates, and hence can explain why the volatility smirk has not diminished over the last
eighteen years. We find that the model can capture the shape of the implied volatility curve both preand post-crash while maintaining reasonable estimates for expected returns, price-dividend ratios,
and risk-free rates.

Introduction

In recent years, option prices on the S&P 500 index (e.g., the SPX contract) have been the focus of
much attention. One ﬁnding that researchers generally agree upon is that, prior to the 1987 stock
market crash, implied ‘volatility smiles’ were relatively ﬂat (see, e.g., Bates (2000)). However, since
the crash, the Black-Scholes (B/S) formula has been producing systematic biases across ‘moneyness’
and maturity of SPX options. In particular, the B/S formula has been signiﬁcantly underpricing
short maturity, deep out-of-the-money puts. This property has been referred to as a ‘volatility
smirk’ (see, e.g., Jackwerth and Rubinstein (1996) and Rubinstein (1994)).
Given the empirical failures of the B/S model in post-crash option data, much research has
gone into identifying which assumptions of that model do not hold in practice. Focusing solely on
stock returns, several authors have documented that, in contrast to the assumptions of B/S, stock
prices jump and are subject to stochastic volatility.1 As such, new option pricing models have been
proposed that incorporate these features (see, e.g., Bates (1996), Duﬃe et al. (2000), Heston (1993)).
Furthermore, these extended models have been tested empirically. Among recent contributions,
Bakshi et al. (1997, 2000), Bates (2000), and Huang and Wu (2004) extract information about the
model parameters of the underlying returns process from derivatives prices alone. Benzoni (2002),
Broadie et al. (2004), Chernov and Ghysels (2000), Eraker (2004), Jones (2003), and Pan (2002)
use data on both underlying and derivatives prices to ﬁt the model. Overall, these studies concur
that a model with stochastic volatility and jumps signiﬁcantly reduces the pricing and hedging
errors of the Black-Scholes model, both in- and out-of-sample.2
These previous studies, however, focus on post-1987 option data. Further, they follow a partial
equilibrium approach and let statistical evidence guide the exogenous speciﬁcation of the underlying
return dynamics. Such an approach leaves open two important questions:
• Does there exist a reasonable model for the dividend process and the preferences of agents
that can explain the post-1987 SPX prices within a general equilibrium framework?
• Can such a model also explain the stark regime change in the volatility smirk that has
maintained since the crash?

See, e.g., Andersen et al. (2002), Chacko and Viceira (2003), Chernov et al. (1999, 2003), and Eraker et al. (2003).
A related literature investigates the proﬁts of option trading strategies (e.g., Coval and Shumway (2001) and
Santa-Clara and Saretto (2004)) and the economic beneﬁts of giving investors access to derivatives when they solve
the portfolio choice problem (e.g., Constantinides et al. (2004), Driessen and Maenhout (2004) and Liu and Pan
(2003)). Overall, these papers suggest that derivatives are non-redundant securities and, in particular, that volatility
risk is priced. These ﬁndings are consistent with the evidence in Bakshi and Kapadia (2003) and Buraschi and
Jackwerth (2001), as well as with the results of the studies that use data on both underlying and derivatives prices
to ﬁt parametric stochastic volatility models.

These questions are the focus of this paper. Interestingly, while the ﬁrst question has already
received considerable attention in the literature, the second question, to our knowledge, has been
largely ignored.
Regarding the ﬁrst question, the general consensus of the existing literature seems to be that it
is diﬃcult to reconcile the post-crash prices of short-maturity, deep out-of-the-money put options
within a general equilibrium setting when the representative agent has standard expected utility
preferences. For example, the problem with specifying a constant relative risk-aversion utility
function for the representative agent is that the risk-aversion parameter γ is forced to govern both
the premium on equity and out-of-the-money puts. Liu, Pan and Wang (2004, LPW) consider
a model in which the endowment is an i.i.d. process and demonstrate that in this setting such
restriction is inconsistent with the empirical evidence presented in, e.g., Jackwerth (2000), Pan
(2002), and Rosenberg and Engle (2002). Further, LPW ﬁnd that even the two-parameter recursive
utility of Epstein-Zin (1989) and Kreps-Porteus (1978) cannot explain the puzzle within their
framework, since it generates results very similar to those of a standard power utility setting (see,
e.g., page 151 of LPW).
Consistent with these empirical ﬁndings, much of the literature has advocated alternative preferences outside of the standard state-independent expected utility framework (see, e.g., Bates (2001),
Brown and Jackwerth (2004), and LPW).3 For example, LPW view the option smirk as evidence
for non-expected utility preferences on the part of market participants. Speciﬁcally, they argue
that if the endowment is an i.i.d. process, then in order to reconcile the prices of options and
the underlying index, agents must exhibit ‘uncertainty aversion’ towards rare events that is diﬀerent from the standard ‘risk-aversion’ they exhibit towards diﬀusive risk. In eﬀect, they provide a
decision-theoretic basis to the idea of crash aversion advocated by Bates (2001), who proposed an
ad-hoc extension of the standard power utility that allows for a special risk-adjustment parameter
for jump risk distinct from that for diﬀusive risk.
In this paper, however, we take a diﬀerent approach. In particular, we expand upon the insights
of Bansal and Yaron (2004, BY) by considering Epstein and Zin (1989) preferences and specifying
the expected growth rate of dividends to be driven by a persistent stochastic variable that follows a
3

Bates (2001) proposes a model in which agents exhibit special crash aversion to capture many stylized facts
from stock index options markets. Brown and Jackwerth (2004) consider a representative agent model in which the
marginal utility of the representative agent is driven by a second state variable that is a function of a ‘momentum’
state variable. Related, Bondarenko (2003) argues that in order to explain S&P 500 put prices a candidate equilibrium
model must produce a path-dependent projected pricing kernel. Finally, Buraschi and Jiltsov (2005) consider a model
in which heterogeneity in beliefs over the dividend growth rate generates state dependent utility. They focus on the
volume of trading in the option market.

jump-diﬀusion process. This approach contrasts with that of LPW and Bates (2001), who consider
non-standard preferences and specify dividends as an i.i.d. jump-diﬀusion process with constant
drift and volatility. However, as noted by BY and Shephard and Harvey (1990), it is very diﬃcult
to distinguish between a purely i.i.d. process and one which incorporates a small persistent component. Nevertheless, the presence of a small persistent component can have important asset pricing
implications.
Our approach has several desirable features. First, consistent with observation, our model
predicts that the dividend process is relatively smooth during a crash event, in contrast to these
previous papers that can only capture a 23% market crash with a 23% drop in dividends. Second,
our model is consistent with a large drop in the risk-free rate on crash dates, unlike these previous
papers that predict a constant risk-free rate. Finally, in contrast to Brown and Jackwerth (2004),
by incorporating jumps in the underlying processes we can capture the volatility smirk with a model
calibration that is more consistent with observation.
Within this framework, we show that a model with standard preferences and a realistic calibration of the aggregate endowment process can simultaneously capture the levels of the equity
risk premium and the risk-free rate, and the prices of deep out-of-the-money put options. The
intuition for these results is similar to that discussed in BY.4 Epstein and Zin preferences allow
for a separation of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) and risk aversion. When the
EIS is larger than one, the intertemporal substitution eﬀect dominates the wealth eﬀect. Thus,
in response to higher expected growth agents buy more assets, and consequently prices increase.
The opposite occurs when there is a decrease in expected growth, e.g., because of an unexpected
downward jump in the predictable component of dividends that triggers a market crash. In this
framework, the risky asset exhibits positive returns when the state is good, while it performs poorly
in the bad state. As such, investors demand a high equity premium and are willing to pay a high
price for a security that delivers insurance in the bad state, like, e.g., a put option on the S&P 500
index.
To maintain parsimony, we follow LPW and restrict our dividend dynamics to have constant
volatility. That is, we consider only the so-called ‘one-channel’ BY case. Extending the model
to incorporate stochastic volatility (the ‘two-channel’ BY case) is straightforward, but in order to
keep the model parsimonious, we choose to focus on a rather minimal model. We solve the model
4

We emphasize, however, that most existing models that capture the equity premium (e.g., BY, Bansal et al.
(2004), and Campbell and Cochrane (1999)) specify the dividend growth rate process as continuous. As such, these
models cannot account for the high premium on near-term out-of-the-money put options, nor the possibility of a
market crash.

3

using standard results in recursive utility (e.g., Duﬃe and Epstein (1992a,b), Duﬃe and Skiadas
(1994), Schroder and Skiadas (1999, 2003), and Skiadas (2003)). We show that the price-dividend
ratio satisﬁes an integro-diﬀerential equation that is non-linear when the EIS is diﬀerent from
the inverse of the coeﬃcient of risk aversion. To solve such equations, we use the approximation
method of Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2005), which is itself an extension of the Campbell-Shiller
approximation (see Campbell and Shiller (1988)).
We consider a realistic calibration of the model and we illustrate its implications for the pricing
of short-maturity SPX options. In our baseline case, a put option with maturity of one month
and a strike price that is 10% out-of-the-money has an implied volatility of approximately 24%. In
contrast, a one-month, at-the-money option has an implied volatility of approximately 14%. That
is, consistent with empirical evidence, we ﬁnd a 10% volatility smirk. Further, we ﬁnd that our
baseline case also captures the empirical properties of dividends and consumption, and generates a
realistic 1% real risk-free rate, a 6% equity premium, and a price-dividend ratio of 20. Sensitivity
analysis is performed suggesting that the main qualitative results are robust to a wide range of
parameter calibrations. In sum, we conclude that our speciﬁcation successfully captures many
salient properties of the SPX prices during the post-1987 period.
Next, we proceed to investigate the second question of the paper. In particular, we examine
whether our model can also explain the stark change in the implied volatility pattern that has been
observed since the 1987 market crash. We note that an extreme event such as the 1987 crash is
likely to dramatically change the investor’s perception about the nature of possible future market
ﬂuctuations. To formalize this intuition, we extend the model to a Bayesian setting in which the
agent formulates a prior on the average value of the jump size, and then updates her prior when
she observes an extreme event such as the 1987 crash. Note that the updating of beliefs only occurs
at crash dates. As such, her posterior beliefs on the average value of the jump size are potentially
very long lived, and hence can explain why the volatility smirk has remained high even eighteen
years after the crash.
We ﬁnd that our model can capture the implied volatility pattern of option prices both before
and after the 1987 crash. Speciﬁcally, we present simulation results in which the steepness of the
volatility smirk (i.e., the diﬀerence between implied volatilities of 10%-out-of-the-money and at-themoney puts) is approximately 3%, a number that is consistent with the pre-crash evidence reported
in, e.g., Bates (2000). At the same time, the occurrence of a jump triggers the updating of the
agent’s beliefs about the expected value of the jump size. As such, after the crash, out-of-the-money
put options are perceived to be more valuable, and the volatility smirk becomes as steep as 10%.

4

Furthermore, consistent with observation the model predicts a downward jump in the risk-free rate
during crash events.
One failure of our model, however, is its predictions for the day of the crash. In particular, our
model predicts jumps in both the stock price and risk-free rate that are even more extreme than
what was observed in the 1987 crash. We attribute this failure to our choice of keeping the model
as parsimonious as possible, and we suppose that if additional parameters and/or state variables
were added, we could further improve the ﬁt. In addition, we note that there are institutional
features that may have attenuated the ﬂuctuation in interest rates and market prices during the
crash day.5
In focusing on the pricing of both out-of-the-money put options and the equity index, our
paper is related to the recent literature that searches for a pricing kernel derived within a general
equilibrium setting that can simultaneously capture the salient features of equity returns, riskfree rates, and the prices of derivative securities. For example, Chen et al. (2004) investigate
the ability of the BY and Campbell and Cochrane (1999) models to jointly price equity and risky
(defaultable) corporate debt. Bansal et al. (2004) examine the implications of the BY and Campbell
and Cochrane (1999) models for the pricing of at-the-money options on a stock market index as
well as on consumption and wealth claims.6
Also related is a growing literature that investigates the eﬀect of changes in investors’ sentiment
(e.g., Han (2005)), market structure, and net buying pressure (e.g., Bollen and Whaley (2004),
Dennis and Mayhew (2002), and Gârleanu et al. (2005)) on the shape of the implied volatility
smile.7 These papers, however, do not address why end users buy these options at high prices
5
On October 19 and 20, 1987, the S&P 500 Futures price was considerably lower than the index price, which
suggests that the drop in the index level does not fully represent the magnitude of the market adjustment in prices.
This evidence can be explained by the existence of signiﬁcant delays in the submission and execution of limit orders
during the crash events, magniﬁed by the standard problem of ‘stale’ prices (see, e.g., Kleidon (1992)). Moreover,
interventions of the exchange might have further contained the ﬂuctuations in stock prices during the crash. Finally,
the Fed assured that it would provide adequate liquidity to the U.S. ﬁnancial system necessary to calm the equity
and other markets (see, e.g., p. 3 of the November 3, 1987, ‘Notes for FOMC Meeting’ document available from the
Federal Reserve web site http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/transcripts/1987/871103StaﬀState.pdf).
6
Other papers that examine the asset pricing implications of the BY model include Bansal and Lundblad (2002),
Hansen, Heaton, and Li (2004), and Malloy et al. (2005).
7
This literature argues that due to the existence of limits to arbitrage, market makers cannot always fully hedge
their positions (see, e.g., Green and Figlewski (1999), Figlewski (1989), Hugonnier et al. (2005), Liu and Longstaﬀ
(2004), Longstaﬀ (1995), and Shleifer and Vishny (1997)). As such, they are likely to charge higher prices when
asked to absorb large positions in certain option contracts. Consistent with this view, Han (2005) ﬁnds that the
S&P 500 option volatility smile tends to be steeper when survey evidence suggests that investors are more bearish,
when large speculators hold more negative net positions in the S&P 500 index futures, and when the index level
drops relative to its fundamentals. Related, Bollen and Whaley (2004) and Gârleanu et al. (2005) identify an excess
of buyer-motivated trades in out-of-the-money SPX puts and ﬁnd a positive link between demand pressure and the
steepness of the volatility smirk.

5

relative to the B/S value or why the 1987 crash changed the shape of the volatility smile so
dramatically and permanently. Our paper oﬀers one possible explanation.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present an option pricing model
that explains the post-1987 volatility smirk in SPX prices. In Section 3, we extend our setting
to incorporate Bayesian updating of the agent’s believes. We use this setting to show that an
event such as the 1987 market crash can generate a change in the SPX price that is qualitatively
consistent with what we observe in the data. We conclude in Section 4.

A General Equilibrium Model of the Volatility Smirk

In this section, we present a general equilibrium model that produces option prices that are consistent with the post-1987 evidence. We specify the consumption and dividend dynamics as

(7)

We note that our speciﬁcation is similar to the so-called one-channel BY model, in which the
expected growth rates in dividend and consumption are stochastic. There is however one important
diﬀerence—in our setting, the state variable driving the expected growth rate in consumption and
dividend (i.e., the x process) is subject to jumps. Consistent with BY, we calibrate the mean
reversion parameter κx to be relatively low, implying that the eﬀect of a downward jump may be
very long-lived. As we demonstrate below, this persistence causes the agent in our model to be
willing to pay a high premium to buy out-of-the-money put options in order to hedge downside
risk.
6

In contrast to our model, LPW assume that the dividend growth rate is subject to jumps, while
the expected dividend growth rate is constant in their model. That is, in their model a crash is due
to a downward jump in the dividend level.8 In particular, in order to explain a 23% drop in market
prices, their model predicts that the dividend also drops by 23%. We note that such large jumps
are not observed in the dividend data, which are instead relatively smooth.

2.1

Recursive Utility

Following Epstein and Zin (1989), we assume that the representative agent’s preferences over a consumption process {Ct } are represented by a utility index U (t) that satisﬁes the following recursive
equation:


U (t) = (1 − e−βdt )Ct1−ρ + e−βdt Et U (t + dt)1−γ

1−ρ
1−γ

1−ρ

.

(8)

With dt = 1, this is the discrete time formulation of Kreps-Porteus/Epstein-Zin (KPEZ), in which
Ψ ≡ 1/ρ is the EIS and γ is the risk-aversion coeﬃcient.
The properties of the stochastic diﬀerential utility in (8) and the related implications for asset
pricing have been previously studied by, e.g., Duﬃe and Epstein (1992a,b), Duﬃe and Skiadas
(1994), Schroder and Skiadas (1999, 2003), and Skiadas (2003). In Appendix A, we extend their
results to the case in which the aggregate output has jump-diﬀusion dynamics.9 The solution to
our model is a special case of such general results and follows immediately from Propositions 1 and
2 in Appendix A. Speciﬁcally, when ρ, γ = 1 Proposition 1 gives the agent’s value function as:

Barro (2005) and Bates (2001) make a similar assumption about the dividend dynamics in their model.
A related literature studies the general equilibrium properties of a jump-diﬀusion economy in which the agent
has non-recursive utility; see, e.g., Ahn and Thompson (1988) and Naik and Lee (1990). Also related, Cvitanić et al.
(2005) and Liu, Longstaﬀ, and Pan (2003) examine the optimal portfolio choice problem when asset returns (or their
volatility) are subject to jumps.

To obtain an approximate solution for I(x), we use the method of Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein
(2005), which itself is in the spirit of the Campbell-Shiller approximation. In particular, we note
that I(x) would possess an exponential aﬃne solution if the last term on the right-hand-side (RHS)
of equation (10) (the θ term) were absent. As such, we move θ to the left-hand-side (LHS) and
then add to both sides of the equation the term h(x) ≡ (n0 + n1 x) eA+Bx . Hence, we re-write
equation (10) as
(n0 + n1 x) eA+Bx − θ = (n0 + n1 x) eA+Bx

We then approximate the RHS to be identically zero and look for a solution of the form
I(x) = eA+Bx .

(13)

We ﬁnd this form to be self-consistent in that the only terms that show up are either linear in or
independent of x. This approach provides us with two equations, which we interpret as identifying
the {n0 , n1 } coeﬃcients in terms of B

Note that our solution is speciﬁed once we identify the four parameters {A, B, n0 , n1 }. To this
end, the system (14)-(15) provides two identifying conditions. The last two equations necessary
to identify the remaining parameters are obtained from minimizing the following unconditional

The logic of this condition is as follows. Recall that we have set the RHS to zero above. Here, we
are choosing the parameters so that the LHS is as close to zero as possible (in a least-squares error
metric). Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2005) show that this approach provides a very accurate
approximation to the problem solution.

The Equity Premium

The general form of the risk premium on the risky asset is given in equation (102) of Proposition
2 in Appendix A. Here, such expression simpliﬁes to
Equity Premium = γ σD ρC,D Ω + (1 − θ)BGσx2 Ω − λ [ χPG+(θ−1)B − χPG − χP(θ−1)B + 1 ] ,

(38)

where the transform χP• was previously deﬁned in equation (16).
In equation (38), the second and third terms represent the risk premia on the diﬀusive and jump
components of expected growth risk. We note that in the constant relative risk aversion (CRRA)
case, γ equals 1/Ψ, and therefore θ = 1. As such, the last two terms in equation (38) vanish and
the CRRA equity premium reduces to (γ σD ρC,D ). Thus, as in BY, with CRRA utility a persistent
endowment process cannot generate a realistic equity premium, let alone explain out-of-the-money
put prices.
On the other hand, in the KPEZ case with Ψ > 1, the risk premium on expected growth
risk is positive. As in BY, the mechanism for this results is as follows. When Ψ > 1, the intertemporal substitution eﬀect dominates the wealth eﬀect. Thus, in response to higher expected
growth, agents buy more assets, and consequently the wealth-to-consumption ratio increases. That
is, in this scenario the coeﬃcient B in the wealth-to-consumption-ratio function (13) is positive. In
addition, due to the eﬀect of leverage the coeﬃcient G in the price-to-dividend ratio function (30)
is larger than B. Hence, the last two terms in equation (38) are positive. Intuitively, with KPEZ
utility and Ψ > 1, the stock exhibits positive returns when the state is good, while it performs
poorly in the bad state. As such, investors demand a higher risk premium.

We note that our model is aﬃne. As such, the option pricing problem can be solved using standard
inverse Fourier transform techniques (see, e.g., Bates (1996), Duﬃe et al. (2000), and Heston
(1993)). In Appendix B, we report a semi-closed form formula for the price of an option given in
equation (39).

2.6

Model Calibration

To illustrate the implications of the model, we consider a realistic calibration of its coeﬃcients.
In the next section, we will show that our main result is robust to a wide range of parameter
calibrations.
1. Consumption and Dividend Dynamics:
To calibrate the consumption process in equations (6), we rely on the model coeﬃcients
reported in BY. BY use the convention to express their parameters in decimal form with
monthly scaling. Here, instead, we express them in decimal form with yearly scaling. After
adjusting for diﬀerences in scaling, we ﬁx μC = 0.018 and Ω = 0.00073.
We note that corporate leverage justiﬁes a higher expected growth rate in dividends than in
consumption (see, e.g., Abel (1999)). This can be modeled by setting μD > μC and φ > 1 in
equation (7). As such, we ﬁx μD = 0.025 and φ = 1.5. We note the diﬀerence with BY, who
assume μD = μC and model leverage entirely through the φ coeﬃcient, which they choose to
be in the 3-3.5 range. We use σD = 4.5, the same value of BY. Finally, we allow for a 60%
correlation between consumption and dividend, i.e., ρC,D = 0.6.
In the x-dynamics (3), we use κx = 0.3. This is in line with the value used by BY (if we
adjust for diﬀerences in scaling and we map the BY AR(1) ρ coeﬃcient into the κx of our
continuous-time speciﬁcation, we ﬁnd κx = 0.2547). We ﬁx σx = 0.4472, a value similar to,
but slightly lower than that of BY (i.e., 0.5280, after adjusting for diﬀerences in scaling). A
slightly lower value of σx is justiﬁed by the fact that part of the variance of the x process is
driven by the jump component, which is absent in the BY model.
Finally, we calibrate the Poisson jump intensity process to yield, on average, one jump every
ﬁfty years, i.e., λ = 0.02. This is consistent with the intuition that our jump process captures
extreme and very rare price ﬂuctuations such as the 1987 market crash. Further, we ﬁx
μν = −0.094. This approach implies that one jump of average size produces a fall in market
prices of approximately 23%, which is in line with the 24.5% drop in the S&P 500 index

12

observed in between the close of Thursday, October 15, and Monday, October 19, 1987.
Finally, we ﬁx the standard deviation of the jump size to σν = 0.015.
2. Preferences:
We use a time discount factor coeﬃcient β = 0.023.
Mehra and Prescott (1985) argue that reasonable values of the relative risk aversion coeﬃcient
γ are smaller than 10. BY consider γ = 7.5 and 10. Bansal et al. (2004) report γ = 7.1421.
As such, we ﬁx γ = 7.5 in our baseline case.
The magnitude of the coeﬃcient ρ is more controversial. Hall (1988) argues that the EIS is
below 1. However, Attanasio and Weber (1989), Bansal et al. (2004), Guvenen (2001), Hansen
and Singleton (1982), among others, estimate the EIS to be in excess of 1. In particular,
Attanasio and Weber (1989) ﬁnd estimates that are close to 2. Bansal et al. (2004) estimate
the EIS to be in the 1.5-2.5 region, and ﬁx it at 2 in their application. Here we follow Bansal
et al. (2004) and use Ψ = 1/ρ = 2 for our baseline case.
In the next section, we document the sensitivity of our results to diﬀerent values of γ and Ψ.
3. Initial Conditions:
In the plots below, we ﬁx the state variable x at its steady-state mean value x0 = μν λ/κx .
We note that x0 is nearly zero in our calibration, i.e., it is very close to the steady-state mean
value of x in the BY model. Further, we emphasize that our results are robust to the value
assigned to the state x. Speciﬁcally, when option prices are computed at values of x that are
within ± 3 standard deviations from the steady-state mean x0 , we obtain implied volatility
plots that are very similar to those reported below.

2.7

Simulation Results

We note that our calibration yields realistic values of the risk-free rate, the equity premium, and
the price-dividend ratio. Speciﬁcally, in the baseline case we ﬁnd that the steady-state real risk-free
rate is 0.93%, while the equity premium predicted by the model is 5.76%. Further, we ﬁnd that
the steady-state price-dividend ratio is 20.
Most importantly, the model produces a volatility smirk that is consistent with post-1987 market
crash observation. Figure 1 reports implied volatilities for options on the S&P 500 index with one
month to maturity for the baseline case. The main result is that put options that are 10% out-ofthe-money have a 23.8% implied volatility, which is roughly consistent with the evidence in, e.g.,

13

Bakshi et al. (2003), Bates (2000), Eraker (2004), Foresi and Wu (2003), and Pan (2002). Further,
at-the-money options have a 13.8% implied volatility. As such, the model predicts a realistic 10%
volatility smirk, as measured by the diﬀerence in 10%-out-of-the-money and at-the-money implied
volatilities.

Sensitivity Analysis

Here we investigate the sensitivity of our ﬁndings to changes in the underlying parameters:
Jump Coeﬃcients
Figure 2 illustrates the sensitivity of our results to the jump coeﬃcients λ and μν . In the left panel
we lower the jump intensity coeﬃcient λ to 0.01, which corresponds to an expected arrival rate of
one jump every 100 years. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that most of the volatility smirk remains intact.
As intuition would suggest, increasing the jump intensity to 0.03, i.e., one jump every 33 years,
makes our results much stronger.

14

In the right panel, we illustrate the eﬀect of a one-standard-deviation perturbation of the average
jump size coeﬃcient. We note that in the model a value of μν = (−0.094 + σν ) = −0.079 implies
that a jump of average size determines a 20.6% fall in stock prices, which is smaller than the 24.5%
drop in the S&P 500 index observed in between the close of Thursday, October 15, and Monday,
October 19, 1987.11 Still, the model predicts a steep volatility smirk.

Preferences Coeﬃcients
Figure 3 illustrates the sensitivity of our results to the preferences coeﬃcients γ and Ψ ≡ 1/ρ. The
left panel shows that when the coeﬃcient of risk aversion is lowered to 5, most of the volatility
smirk remains intact. Further, we note that when γ = 10 (the upper bound of the range that
Mehra and Prescott (1985) consider reasonable) the volatility smirk becomes considerably steeper.
11
Note, however, that the drop in prices between the close of Friday October 16 and Monday October 19 was
20.46%. Furthermore, the S&P 500 closing prices over that week are as follows. 1987-10-13: $314.52; 1987-10-14:
$305.23; 1987-10-15: $298.08; 1987-10-16: $282.94; 1987-10-19: $225.06; 1987-10-20: $236.84.

15

The right panel illustrates the sensitivity of the volatility smirk to the EIS coeﬃcient. As noted
previously, researchers have obtained a wide array of estimates for this parameter. Our base case
estimate of ρ = 2 is consistent with that of Bansal et al. (2004). Here we demonstrate that even
lower estimates for ρ, such as 1.25 and 1.5, still produce steep volatility smirks.

Bayesian Updating of Jump Beliefs

In this section, we examine whether our model can also explain the stark change in the implied
volatility pattern that has maintained since the 1987 market crash. In the previous section, we
assumed that the speciﬁed parameters of the model are known to the agent. In what follows, we
will assume that, because stock market crashes are so rare, the agent does not know the exact
distribution of the jump size. As such, she will update her prior beliefs about the distribution of
jump size after observing a crash. Note that this Bayesian updating only occurs at crash dates. As
such, the eﬀect on the implied volatility pattern can be extremely long-lived.

16

We specify the model so that, prior to the ﬁrst crash, given the agent’s information set, the
distribution of the jump size ν1 is a normal random variable whose mean value μ̄ν is itself an
unknown quantity, and is selected from a normal distribution:
ν1 |μ̄ν
μ̄ν

; N (μ̄ν , σ̄ν2 )

(40)

¯ ν , σ̄
¯ ν2 ) .
; N (μ̄

(41)

That is, before the ﬁrst crash occurs, the agent’s prior is
¯ ν , σ̄ν2 + σ̄
¯ ν2 ) .
ν1 ; N (μ̄

(42)

After the ﬁrst crash occurs and the agent observes the realization of ν1 , she updates her beliefs
about the distribution of μ̄ν via the projection theorem:
Cov(μ̄ν , ν1 )
( ν1 − E[
ν1 ] )

(44)

Hence, the agent sees the second crash size as distributed normally
ν2

; N E[μ̄ν |
ν1 ], σ̄ν2 + Var[μ̄ν |
ν1 ] .

(45)

We see from equation (43) that if the realization of ν1 is substantially worse than the pre-crash
estimate μ̄ν , then, after the ﬁrst crash, the expected size of the next crash is considerably worse.
Further, we emphasize that the random variable μ̄ν is chosen only once at date-0, and hence
uncertainty about its value is reduced at the crash date, as noted in equation (44). Indeed, prior to
¯ ν2 , as can be seen from equation (41). However,
the crash the uncertainty about the value of μ̄ν is σ̄
after the crash, this uncertainty reduces to

so that σ̄
ﬁrst crash. While the agent would typically continue to update her beliefs about the distribution of
μ̄ν when subsequent crashes occur, given the parametrization of the model we choose below, there
would be little change in the subsequent posterior beliefs. Therefore, and because it considerably
simpliﬁes the analysis, we make the assumption that the updating of jump beliefs occurs only once,
17

when the agent observes a jump for the ﬁrst time. Eﬀectively this approach implies that the preand post-crash jump distributions are given by, respectively:

Model Solution with Bayesian Updating

We have assumed that the agent updates her beliefs only once, when she observes the ﬁrst jump.
As such, we only need to consider two cases when solving our problem. First, the case in which the
agent is aware that stock market prices can jump, but she has not yet seen a jump occur. Second,
the case in which the agent has witnessed a jump in market prices and therefore has updated her
beliefs on the jump distribution. Intuitively, we can think of the ﬁrst case as a description of the
pre-1987 crash economy, while the second one depicts the post-1987 regime.
Once the agent has updated her beliefs in reaction to the occurrence of the ﬁrst jump, the postcrash problem reduces to the setting without Bayesian updating that we have already considered in
Sections 2.1-2.3. As such, the solution to the problem is unchanged, except that the mean μν and
variance σν2 in the jump distribution (5) are replaced by those of the post-crash jump distribution
(47).
When solving the pre-crash problem, instead, we need to account for the fact that the agent
rationally anticipates that the occurrence of a crash will determine an updating of the prior on
the jump coeﬃcients. To this end, we proceed as follows: As before, we exogenously specify
the aggregate consumption and dividends dynamics as in equations (3)-(7). However, we now
assume that the pre-crash jump size distribution is given by equation (46). Further, we consider a
representative agent’s whose preferences over the consumption process {Ct } are represented by a
utility index U (t) that satisﬁes the recursive equation (8).
Proposition 1 in Appendix A still applies. As such, when ρ, γ = 1 the pre-crash value function
Jpre has the form:
ec(1−γ) θ
β Ipre (x)θ ,
1−γ
where the price-consumption ratio Ipre satisﬁes the following equation

ν1 ) and B̃ ≡ B(
ν1 )
where, for each diﬀerent possible realization of ν1 , the coeﬃcients Ã ≡ A(
minimize the squared error in equation (17).
An approach similar to that followed in Section 2.1 delivers an approximate solution of the form
Ipre (x) = eApre +Bpre x .

(51)

Speciﬁcally, we re-write equation (49) as
(p0 + p1 x) eApre +Bpre x − θ − λe(1−θ)(Apre +Bpre x) Eν eθ(Ã+B̃(x+ν1 )) = (p0 + p1 x) eApre +Bpre x

The intuition for this formula is similar to that discussed previously in Section 2.4. That is, the
ﬁrst term in equation (72) is identical to the risk premium in a model with CRRA. The following
terms are the risk premia on diﬀusive and jump components of expected growth risk. Again, in
the KPEZ with Ψ > 1 case, the agent demands a positive premium on expected growth risk, which
increases the risk premium on the risky asset.

Valuing Options on the Dividend Claim

The option pricing problem for the pre-crash economy is outside of the aﬃne class. Thus, we
lack an analytical formula for the option price. However, the problem is easily handled via Monte
Carlo simulation. Speciﬁcally, we simulate two antithetic samples of 50,000 paths of the dividend
δ and the process x from the Q-dynamics (23) and (24). For each simulated case, we use the

we compute the simulated value of the contingent claim Vpre (T ) = DT Ipre

Finally, we average across the simulated discounted realizations of |Vpre (T ) − K|+ to approximate
the expectation in (39).

Model Calibration

We note that the requirements imposed on this model is considerably higher than in the previous
section in that here we want to explain not only the post-1987 volatility smirk, but also the regime
shift in option prices that was observed immediately after the 1987 crash. As such, we consider a
slightly diﬀerent baseline calibration. We argue that the coeﬃcient values that we use below are
still consistent with observation and similar to those used in, e.g., BY and Bansal et al. (2004).
1. Consumption and Dividend Dynamics:
In the consumption dynamics (6), we ﬁx μC = 0.018 and Ω = 0.00078.
For the dividend process (7), we use μD = 0.018, φ = 2.1, and σD = 3.5. We ﬁx the correlation
between shocks to dividend and consumption at 25%, i.e., ρC,D = 0.25.
In the x-dynamics (3), we use κx = 0.34 and σx = 0.6325. We ﬁx the Poisson jump intensity
process at λ = 0.007, which on average corresponds to less than one jump every hundred
years.
¯ ν = −0.011 and we assume that at the time of the crash ν1
In equations (46)-(47), we ﬁx μ̄

takes value −0.094. Further, we set σ̄ν = 0.0023 and σ̄
The intuition for this calibration is as follows. Before a crash occurs, the agent does not fully
appreciate the extent to which prices can fall. As such, her prior is that the jump size ν1 has
¯ ν = −0.011. The agent realizes however that there is considerable uncernearly zero mean, μ̄

of ν1 , which equals σ̄ν2 + σ̄

22

Suddenly, she unexpectedly observes a crash of the proportion of the 1987 event. When that
happens, she updates her beliefs about the post-crash jump distribution according to (47). As
such, the mean and standard deviation of the post-crash jump size ν2 become, respectively,

(74)
¯ν

That is, immediately after the crash the agent updates her prior on the average jump size in
a way that reﬂects the possibility of a large, although very rare, stock price fall.
Further, we note that the occurrence of a crash determines a stark increase in the precision
of the agent’s belief about the jump size. Speciﬁcally, the standard deviation of the postcrash jump size is over seven times smaller than its pre-crash value. As discussed above, this
observation is consistent with the intuition that a single event of the proportion of the 1987
market crash can generate most of the updating of the agent’s beliefs.
2. Preferences:
We use a time discount factor coeﬃcient β = 0.017. We ﬁx the coeﬃcient of relative risk
aversion at γ = 10. Finally, we follow Bansal et al. (2004) and we use Ψ = 1/ρ = 2 for our
baseline case.
3. Initial Conditions:
In the plots below, we ﬁx the state variable x at the its steady-state mean value. In the

Simulation Results

We note that our calibration yields realistic values of the risk-free rate and the equity premium,
both pre- and post-crash. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that the pre-crash steady-state real risk-free rate is
1.33%, while the equity premium predicted by the model is 4.48%. Post-crash, the steady-state
value of the risk-free rate drops to 0.7%, while the equity premium becomes 6.4%. Further, the
calibration matches other aspects of the economy. For instance, we ﬁnd that the steady-state value

23

of the price-dividend ratio is around 27, a value that drops to approximately 19 in the post-crash
economy.
Rubinstein (1994) argues that until 1987 the Black-Scholes formula worked quite well to explain
S&P 500 index option prices. Similarly, Bates (2000) notes that pre-crash implied volatilities from
out-of-the-money puts on the S&P 500 futures where almost invariably higher than those from
at-the-money options. However, pre-crash implicit volatilities from out-of-the-money calls were
sometimes below and sometimes above those from at-the-money options. As such, pre-crash implied
volatilities displayed either a mild ‘smile’ or tenuous ‘smirk’ pattern. Our calibration produces a
mild smirk that is qualitatively consistent with the Bates evidence. As we illustrate in Figure 4,
the diﬀerence between the implied volatilities from 10%-out-of-the-money and at-the-money puts
is approximately 3%.
Immediately after the crash, however, the agent updates her beliefs about the expected value of
the jump size. As such, the volatility smirk steepens dramatically. In Figure 4, we show that post1987 the diﬀerence between the implied volatilities from 10%-out-of-the-money and at-the-money
puts becomes nearly 10%.
Finally, we note a drawback of our calibration. During the two weeks after the ‘Black Monday’
in October 1987, the 3-month Treasury bill rate was on average 1.5% lower than the same rate
during the two weeks preceeding the crash.12 Consistent with observation, our model predicts a
fall in the risk-free rate at the time of a market crash. However, the magnitude of the drop is larger
than what was observed in October 1987. To study this model implication, we use data from the
COMPUSTAT database and compute the price-dividend ratio for the S&P 500 index as of the end
of September 1987. We ﬁnd it to be 36.24. Next, we infer the pre-crash value xt of the latent
process x (where t is the end of September 1987) by matching the pre-crash price-dividend ratio
predicted by the model with the value observed in the data:
D
(xt ) = eFpre +Gpre xt ≡ 36.24 .
Ipre

(75)

Then, we use equation (57) to compute the change in the risk-free rate determined by a jump in x
from the pre-crash value xt to the post-crash level xt + ν1 . We ﬁnd the jump in the risk-free rate
to be -5.2%.
Related, we can use our model to predict the drop in stock prices at the time of the 1987 crash.
We do so by following an approach similar to that we used above to determine the jump in the

Conclusions

Prior to the stock market crash of 1987, the Black-Scholes model of option prices worked rather
well across all strikes. Since the crash, however, deep out-of-the-money S&P 500 put options have
become ‘expensive’ relative to the Black-Scholes benchmark. These observations motivate two
important questions. First, whether there exists a reasonable model for the endowment process
25

and the preferences of agents that can explain the post-1987 SPX prices. Second, whether such a
model can also explain the stark change in the volatility smirk that has maintained since the 1987
market crash. These are the questions that we address in the paper.
Many researchers (e.g., Liu, Pan and Wang (2005)) have investigated the ﬁrst of the two questions. In general, they conclude that the prices of these securities cannot be justiﬁed in a general
equilibrium setting if the representative agent is endowed with ‘standard preferences’. In this paper, however, we demonstrate that the prices of these securities can be reconciled if the agent is
endowed with Epstein-Zin preferences and if the expected growth rate of the aggregate dividend
can experience (rare) jumps. We identify a realistic calibration of the model that simultaneously
matches the empirical properties of dividends, the equity premium, and the level of the risk-free
rate. Most importantly, we ﬁnd that the agent, concerned with the possibility of a market crash,
is willing to pay a high premium to buy out-of-the-money put options and hedge downside risk.
Speciﬁcally, in our baseline calibration the implied volatility of 10% out-of-the-money put options
with one month to maturity is close to 24%. At-the-money options, instead, have an implied
volatility of approximately 14%. That is, consistent with empirical evidence we can generate a 10%
volatility smirk.
We then proceed to investigate the second question, namely, whether the model can also explain
the regime change observed in S&P 500 prices immediately after the 1987 market crash. We note
that an extreme event such as the 1987 market crash is likely to dramatically change the investor’s
perception about the nature of possible future market ﬂuctuations. To formalize this intuition, we
extend the model to a Bayesian setting in which the agent uses the information on a jump in market
prices to update her belief about the expected magnitude of future jumps. Speciﬁcally, we assume
that the jump size is a normal random variable whose mean value is itself a normally distributed
random variable. The agent formulates a prior on the mean value of the jump size, and updates
her prior when she observes an extreme event such as the 1987 crash.
We ﬁnd that the model can explain the time variation in the shape of the volatility smirk.
Speciﬁcally, we present simulation results in which the steepness of the pre-crash volatility smirk
(i.e., the diﬀerence between implied volatilities from 10%-out-of-the-money and at-the-money puts)
is approximately 3%, a number that is consistent with the pre-crash evidence reported in, e.g., Bates
(2000). At the same time, the occurrence of a jump triggers the updating of the agent’s beliefs
about the expected value of the jump size. As such, after the crash out-of-the-money put options
are perceived to be more valuable, and the volatility smirk becomes as steep as 10%, consistent
with the post-crash evidence.

26

Our model shows that a single channel (a rare jump in consumption growth) suﬃces to reconcile
option and index prices. However, for the case with Bayesian updating, the model consistent with
pre- and post-crash data seems to predict a crash on the day of the event larger than what was
observed in 1987. We note that there are several channels available that would most likely improve
the ﬁt on this dimension also. For instance, as in Collin Dufresne et al. (2003), we can allow for
Bayesian updating not only on the size of the jump, but also on its intensity, i.e., on the probability
that a jump will occur. Further, following BY we could model volatility as stochastic (possibly
with jumps). We leave these interesting extensions to future research.

Appendix A: Equilibrium Prices in a Jump-Diﬀusion Exchange
Economy with Recursive Utility

There are several formal treatments of stochastic diﬀerential utility and its implications for asset
pricing (see, e.g., Duﬃe and Epstein (1992a,b), Duﬃe and Skiadas (1994), Schroder and Skiadas
(1999, 2003), and Skiadas (2003)). For completeness, in this Appendix we oﬀer a very simple informal derivation of the pricing kernel that obtains in an exchange economy where the representative
agent has a KPEZ recursive utility. Our contribution is to characterize equilibrium prices in an
exchange economy where aggregate output has particular jump-diﬀusion dynamics (Propositions 1
and 2).

5.1

Representation of Preferences and Pricing Kernel

We assume the existence of a standard ﬁltered probability space (Ω, F, {Ft }, P ) on which there

exists a vector z(t) of d independent Brownian motions and one counting process N (t) = i 1{τ ≤t}
for a sequence of inaccessible stopping times τi , i = 1, 2, . . ..13

i

Aggregate consumption in the economy is assumed to follow a continuous process, with stochastic growth rate and volatility, which both may experience jumps:
d log Ct = μC (Xt )dt + σC (Xt )dz(t)
dXt = μx (Xt )dt + σx (Xt )dz(t) + νdN (t) .

(77)
(78)

We note that Xt is a n-dimensional Markov process (we assume suﬃcient regularity on the coeﬃcient
of the stochastic diﬀerential equation (SDE) for it to be well-deﬁned, e.g., Duﬃe (2001) Appendix
B). In particular μx is an (n, 1) vector, σx is an (n, d) matrix and ν is a (n, 1) vector of i.i.d. random
13
We note that N (t) is a pure jump process by construction and hence is independent of z(t) by construction (in
the sense that their quadratic co-variation is zero).

27

variable with joint density (conditional on a jump dN (t) = 1) of g(ν). We further assume that the
t
counting process has a (positive integrable) intensity λ(Xt ) in the sense that N (t) − 0 λ(Xs )ds is
a (P, Ft ) martingale.
Following Epstein and Zin (1989), we assume that the representative agent’s preferences over
a consumption process {Ct } are represented by a utility index U (t) that satisﬁes the following
recursive equation:

U (t) = (1 − e−βdt )Ct1−ρ + e−βdt Et U (t + dt)1−γ

1−ρ
1−γ

1−ρ

.

(79)

With dt = 1, this is the discrete time formulation of KPEZ, in which Ψ ≡ 1/ρ is the EIS and γ is
the risk-aversion coeﬃcient.
To simplify the derivation let us deﬁne the function
 1−α

0 < α = 1
(1−α)
uα (x) =

α = 1.

1−ρ

Then deﬁning the ‘normalized’ utility index J as the increasing transformation of the initial utility
index J(t) = uγ (U (t)) equation (79) becomes simply:
g(J(t)) = (1 − e−βdt )uρ (Ct ) + e−βdt g (Et [J(t + dt)]) .

(80)

Using the identity J(t + dt) = J(t) + dJ(t) and performing a simple Taylor expansion we obtain:
0 = βuρ (Ct )dt − βg(J(t)) + g (J(t)) Et [dJ(t)] .

(81)

Slightly rearranging the above equation, we obtain a backward recursive stochastic diﬀerential
equation which could be the basis for a formal deﬁnition of stochastic diﬀerential utility (see Duﬃe
Epstein (1992), Skiadas (2003)):
Et [dJ(t)] = −

To obtain an expression for the pricing kernel note that under the assumption (which we maintain throughout) that an ‘interior’ solution to the optimal consumption-portfolio choice of the agent
exists, a necessary condition for optimality is that the gradient of the Utility index is zero for any
small deviation of the optimal consumption process in a direction that is budget feasible. More
precisely, let us deﬁne the utility index corresponding to such a small deviation by:

economy.14

Proof 2 To prove the result for the interest rate, apply Itô-Doeblin to the pricing kernel and it
follows from r(t) = −E[ dΠ(t)

Now substitute the expression for

(103)

from the equation in (89) to obtain the result.

To prove the result for the consumption claim, deﬁne S(t) = ct I(xt ). Then using the deﬁnition
of

Π(t) = e
we obtain:

Appendix B: The Price of an Option in the Post-Crash Aﬃne

We note that the model in Section 2 is aﬃne. In particular, the value of the dividend claim

(109)
(110)

As such, the option pricing problem can be solved using standard inverse Fourier transform techniques. In particular, the date-t value of a European call option on the dividend claim Vt , with
maturity T and strike price K, is given by

exp (M (T − t) + N (T − t)xt + α log V (t))

and obtain that
Et [dYt ] = 0
holds when N and M satisfy equations (115)-(116) above. A standard argument then shows that
Yt is a Q-martingale.
