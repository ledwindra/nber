July 2005

ABSTRACT
The potential for portfolio diversification is driven broadly by two characteristics: the degree to
which systematic risk factors are correlated with each other and the degree of dependence individual
firms have to the different types of risk factors. Using a global vector autoregressive macroeconomic
model accounting for about 80% of world output, we propose a model for exploring credit risk
diversification across industry sectors and across different countries or regions. We find that full
firm-level parameter heterogeneity along with credit rating information matters a great deal for
capturing differences in simulated credit loss distributions. These differences become more
pronounced in the presence of systematic risk factor shocks: increased parameter heterogeneity
reduces shock sensitivity.

Allowing for regional parameter heterogeneity seems to better

approximate the loss distributions generated by the fully heterogenous model than allowing just for
industry heterogeneity. The regional model also exhibits less shock sensitivity.

Introduction

In theory the potential for credit risk diversification for banks can be considerable. Insofar as different industries or sectors are more or less pro-cyclical, banks can alter their lending policy and
capital allocation across those sectors. Similarly, internationally active banks are able to apply
analogous changes across countries. In addition to such passive credit portfolio management, financial engineering, using instruments such as credit derivatives, enables banks (and other financial
institutions) to engage in active credit portfolio management by buying and selling credit risk (or
credit protection) across sectors and countries. Credit exposure to the U.S. chemical industry, say,
can be traded for credit exposure to the Korean steel sector. One may, therefore, think of a global
market for credit exposures where credit risk can be exported and imported.
Within such a global context, default probabilities are driven primarily by how firms are tied
to fundamental risk factors, both domestic and foreign, and how those factors are linked across
countries. In order to implement such a global approach in the analysis of credit risk, we have
developed in Pesaran, Schuermann and Weiner (2004), hereafter PSW, a global vector autoregressive macroeconometric model (GVAR) for a set of 25 countries accounting for about 80% of world
output. Importantly, the foreign variables in the GVAR are tailored to match the international
trade pattern of the country under consideration.
Pesaran, Schuermann, Treutler and Weiner (2005), hereafter PSTW, relate asset returns for
a portfolio of 119 firms to the global macroeconometric model, thus isolating macro eﬀects from
idiosyncratic shocks as they relate to default (and hence loss). The GVAR eﬀectively serves as the
macroeconomic engine capturing the economic environment faced by an internationally active global
bank. Domestic and foreign macroeconomic variables are allowed to impact each firm diﬀerently.
In this way we are able to account for firm-specific heterogeneity in an explicitly interdependent
global context. Developing such a conditional modeling framework is particularly important for
the analysis of the eﬀects of diﬀerent types of shock scenarios on credit risk, an important feature
we exploit here.
In this paper we extend the analysis of PSTW along four dimensions. First, we provide some
analytical results on the limits of credit risk diversification. Second, we illustrate the impact of two
diﬀerent identification restrictions regarding the default condition on the resulting loss distributions.
Third, we use this framework to understand the degree of diversification with five models which
diﬀer in their degree of parameter heterogeneity, from fully homogeneous to allowing for industry
and regional heterogeneity but homogeneous factor sensitivities. Fourth, we have more than doubled
the number of firms in the portfolio from 119 to 243 firms providing for more robust results and
allowing us to explore the importance of exposure granularity. We go on to explore the impact
of shocks to real equity prices, interest rates and real output on the resulting loss distribution as
implied by the diﬀerent model specifications.

2

Such conditional analysis using shock scenarios from observable risk factors is not possible
in the most commonly used model in the credit risk literature, namely the Vasicek (1987, 1991,
2002) adaptation of the Merton (1974) default model. In addition to being driven by a single and
unobserved risk factor, this model also assumes that risk factor sensitivities, analogous to CAPMstyle betas, are the same across all firms in all regions and industries, yielding a fully homogeneous
model. This single factor model also underlies the risk-based capital standards in the New Basel
Accord (BCBS 2004), as shown in Gordy (2003).
We find that firm-level parameter heterogeneity and information about credit ratings matter a
great deal for capturing diﬀerences in the loss distributions. In line with theoretical and empirical
results in Hanson, Pesaran and Schuermann (2005, HPS), we show that neglected heterogeneity
leads to under estimation of expected losses, and once those are controlled for, to over estimation of
unexpected losses. Wrongly imposing homogeneity results in excessively skewed and fat-tailed loss
distributions. In the process of allowing for firm heterogeneity, credit rating information turns out
to be particularly important since default correlation and credit ratings are closely related even if
return correlations across firms are kept constant. These diﬀerences become more pronounced in
the presence of systematic risk factor shocks: increased parameter heterogeneity greatly reduces
shock sensitivity. For example, an adverse 2.33σ shock to U.S. equity prices increases loss volatility
by about 31% for the fully heterogeneous model, but by 73% for the homogeneous pooled model.
These diﬀerences become even more pronounced as shocks become more extreme: for an adverse
5σ shock to U.S. equity prices, loss volatility increases by about 85% for the heterogeneous model,
but by more than 240% for the restricted model.
We further find that symmetric shocks result in asymmetric and nonproportional loss outcomes due to the nonlinearity of the default model. Loss increases arising from adverse shocks are
larger than corresponding loss decreases from benign (but equiprobable) shocks. Here too there
are important diﬀerences in the loss distributions depending on the degree of underlying model
heterogeneity. While all models exhibit this asymmetry for expected losses and loss volatility, only
the fully heterogeneous model exhibits this particular asymmetric response in the tail of the loss
distribution. For the restricted models the opposite is true: the reduction in tail risk arising from
the benign shock is larger than the corresponding increase due to the adverse shock. By imposing
homogeneity, not only are the relative loss responses exaggerated (most of the percentage increases
and all of the decreases are larger for the restricted than for the unrestricted model), but perceived
reduction of risk in the tail of the loss distribution tends to be overly optimistic. Failing to properly
account for parameter heterogeneity could therefore result in too much implied risk capital.
Both the baseline and shock-conditional loss distributions seem to change noticeably with the
addition of heterogeneous factor loadings. Allowing for regional heterogeneity appears to be more
important than allowing for industry or sector heterogeneity. However, the biggest marginal change
arises when allowing for full heterogeneity.
3

The apparently innocuous choice of identifying restriction — same default threshold versus same
unconditional probability of default (or distance to default), by credit rating — appears to make a
material diﬀerence. Under the same threshold (by rating) restriction, conditioning on risk factor
forecasts changes firm default probabilities only somewhat: unconditional and conditional probabilities of default are highly correlated (96%). By contrast, such conditioning has a significant impact
under the same distance to default (by rating) restriction. The conditional default probabilities
disperse resulting in a lower correlation with unconditional default probabilities (79%).
We find that the loss distributions are relatively insensitive to typical business cycle shocks
arising from changes in interest rates or real output. Furthermore, these results seem to be reasonably robust to the choice of firm-specific return regressions, and if true are likely to have important
policy implications, particularly given the intense debate surrounding the possible procyclicality of
the New Basel Accord (Carpenter, Whitesell and Zakrajšek 2001, Altman, Bharath, and Saunders
2002, Carey 2002, Allen and Saunders 2004).
Finally, we are able to assess the impact of granularity or portfolio size on the risk of the
portfolio for a simplified version of the model where analytic solutions for unexpected loss (UL)
are available. The lower the average correlation across firm returns, the greater is the potential for
diversification. But to achieve the theoretical (asymptotic) lower bound to the UL, a relatively large
N is required when return correlations are low. A common rule of thumb for return diversification
of a portfolio of equities is around 50. Default correlations are, of course, much lower than return
correlations, and we show that to come within 3% of the asymptotic UL values, more than 5,000
firms are needed. Thus credit portfolios or credit derivatives such as CDOs which contain rather
fewer numbers of firms most likely would still retain a significant degree of idiosyncratic risk. In
the case, for instance, of our more modestly sized portfolio of 243 firms, the UL is some 44% above
its asymptotic value.
The plan for the remainder of the paper is as follows: Section 2 provides a model of firm value and
default. Section 3 covers some useful analytical results for the loss distribution of a credit portfolio.
Section 4 presents the framework for conditional credit risk modeling including a brief overview of
the global macroeconometric model. In Section 5 we introduce the credit portfolio and present the
results from the multi-factor return regressions that link firm returns to the observable systematic
risk factors from the macroeconomic engine. We present results for five models ranging from the
homogeneous pooled model to one allowing for full heterogeneity, with intermediate specifications
that allow for industry and geography eﬀects. In Section 6 we consider how those models impact
the resulting loss distributions under a variety of macroeconomic shock scenarios. In this section we
also consider the impact of portfolio size and granularity on the resulting loss distribution. Some
concluding remarks are provided in Section 7.

Firm Value and Default1

2

Most credit default models have two basic components: (i) a model of the firm value, and (ii)
conditions under which default occurs. In this section we set out such a model by adapting the
option theoretic default model due to Merton (1974) to our global macroeconometric specification
of the systematic factors. Merton recognized that a lender is eﬀectively writing a put option on the
assets of the borrowing firm; owners and owner-managers (i.e. shareholders) hold the call option.
If the value of the firm falls below a certain threshold, the owners will put the firm to the debtholders. Thus a firm is expected to default when the value of its assets falls below a threshold
value determined by its liabilities. In this way default risk is expected to vary across firms due to
diﬀerences in leverage or volatility. While the latter is typically estimated using market data, the
former is often measured using balance sheet data which is noisy and prone to manipulation.
The problem of modeling firm default inherits all the asymmetric information and agency problems between borrower and lender well known in the banking literature. The argument is roughly as
follows. A firm, particularly if it is young and privately held, knows more about its health, quality
and prospects than outsiders, e.g. lenders. Banks are particularly well suited to help overcome these
informational asymmetries through relationship lending; learning by lending. Moreover, managers
and owners of firms have an incentive to substitute higher risk for lower risk investments as they
are able to receive upside gains (they hold a call option on the firm’s assets) while lenders are not
(they hold a put option). See the survey by James and Smith (2000) for a more extensive discussion, as well as Garbade (2001). If the firm is public, we have other sources of information such as
quarterly and annual reports which, though accounting based, are then digested and interpreted
by the market. Stock and bond prices serve as summary statistics of that information.
The scope for credit risk diversification thus can manifest itself through two channels: how firm
value reacts to changes in the systematic risk factors and through diﬀerentiated default thresholds.
Both channels need to be modeled. Since we shall be concerned with possibilities of diversification
along the dimensions of geography and industry (or sector), we will consider firms j, j = 1, ..., N,
in country or region i, i = 1, ..., M, and sector s, s = 1, ..., S, and denote the firm’s asset value at
the end of period t by Vjis,t , and its outstanding stock of debt by Djis,t . According to Merton’s
model, default occurs at the maturity date of the debt, t + H, when the firm’s assets, Vjis,t+H ,
are less than the face value of the debt at that time, Djis,t+H . This is in contrast with the firstpassage model where default would occur the first time that Vjis,t falls below a default boundary (or
threshold) over the period t to t + H.2 Under both models the default probabilities are computed
1
2

This section follows the approach introduced in PSTW.
See Black and Cox (1976). More recent modeling approaches include direct strategic default considerations

(e.g. Mella-Barral and Perraudin (1997)). Leland and Toft (1996) develop a model where default is determined
endogenously, rather than by the imposition of a positive net worth condition. For a review of these models, see, for
example, Lando (2004, Chapter 3).

with respect to the probability distribution of asset values at the terminal date, t + H in the case
of the original Merton model, and over the period from t to t + H in the case of the first-passage
models. Although our approach can be adapted to the first-passage model, for simplicity we follow
the Merton approach here.
We follow the approach developed in detail in PSTW where default is said to occur if the value
of equity, Ejis,t+H , falls below a possibly small but positive threshold value, Cjis,t+H ,
Ejis,t+H < Cjis,t+H .

(1)

This is reasonable since technical default definitions used by banks and bondholders are typically
weaker than outright bankruptcy. Moreover, because bankruptcies are costly and violations to the
absolute priority rule in bankruptcy proceedings are so common, in practice the debtholders have an
incentive to put the firm into receivership even before the equity value of the firm hits the zero value.
The default point could vary over time and with firm’s particular characteristics (region and sector
being two of them, of course). It is, however, diﬃcult to measure, since observable accounting-based
factors are at best noisy and at worst reported with bias, highlighting the information asymmetry
between managers (agents) and shareholders and debtholders (principals).3
To overcome these measurement diﬃculties and information asymmetries, we make use of a
firm’s credit rating R ∈ R = {AAA, AA, ...}.4 This will help us specifically in nailing down the

default threshold, details of which are given below in Section 2.1. Naturally rating agencies have
access to, and presumably make use of, private information about the firm to arrive at their firm-

specific credit rating, in addition to incorporating public information such as, for instance, financial
statements and equity returns.
To simplify the exposition here we adopt the standard practice and assume that asset values
follow a Gaussian geometric random walk with a fixed drift.
ln (Ejis,t+1 /Ejist ) = rjis,t+1 = µjis + σ jis εjis,t+1 ,
where εjis,t+1 v N (0, 1), distributed independently across t (but not necessarily across firms, σ jis
is the return innovation volatility and µjis the drift of the one-period holding return, rjis,t+1 . This
specification is “unconditional” in the sense that it does not allow for the eﬀects of business cycle
and monetary policy variables on returns (and hence defaults). We shall return to conditional asset
return specifications that allow for such eﬀects in Section 2.2. The distribution of the H-period
ahead holding period return associated with the above specification is then given by
rjis (t, t + H) =

H

rjis,t+τ

v N (Hµjis , Hσ jis ),

Duﬃe and Lando (2001), with this in mind, allow for imperfect information about the firm’s assets and default

threshold in the context of a first-passage model.

For an overview of the rating industry, see Cantor and Packer (1995). For no reason other than convenience, we
shall be using the ratings nomenclature used by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch.

where the notation (t, t + H) is used throughout to mean over the period “from t + 1 to t + H.”
Default then occurs at the end of H periods if the H-period change in firm value (or return)
falls below the log threshold-equity ratio, or return default threshold, as in

π jis (t, t + H) = Φ

where Φ(·) is the distribution function of the standard normal variate. The argument of Φ(·) in
(3) is sometimes called the distance to default (DD). We may rewrite the H-period forward return
default threshold as
√
λjis (t, t + H) = Hµjis + Φ−1 (π jis (t, t + H)) σ jis H.
where Φ−1 (π jis (t, t + H)) is the quantile associated with the default probability π jis (t, t + H). The
firm defaults if its H-period return, rjis (t, t + H), falls below its expected H-period return, less a
multiple of its H-period volatility.5

2.1

Identification of the Default Threshold

In this section we provide a brief discussion of the problem of identifying the default threshold for
each firm. Details can be found in Hanson, Pesaran and Schuermann (2005), hereafter HPS. In
what follows we shall be suppressing the country and sector subscript for simplicity. Suppose now
that at time t we have a portfolio of size Nt of firms, or credit exposures to those firms, and denote
P t
6
the exposure share or weight for the j th firm as wjt ≥ 0 such that N
j=1 wjt = 1. At time t the
expected portfolio default rate at the end of H-periods from now (e.g. one year) is then given by

Relation (4) may be thought of as a moment estimator for the unknown thresholds λj (t, t + H),
since µj and σ j and π(t, t + H) can be estimated from past observed returns and realized defaults.
With one moment condition and Nt unknown thresholds, one needs to impose Nt − 1 identifying

Note that Φ−1 (πjis (t, t + H)) is negative for πjis (t, t + H) < 0.5, which covers the default probability values

typically considered in the literature.

restrictions; for example, one could impose the same threshold for every firm in the portfolio. The
number of required identifying restrictions could be reduced if further information can be used.
One such type of information is provided by credit rating-specific default information.
Although firm-specific default probabilities, π j (t, t + H), are not observable, the default rate
by rating, π R (t, t + H), can be estimated by pooling historical observations of firms’ defaults in a
particular rating class, using a sample spanning t = 1, ..., T . In this case the number of identifying
restrictions can be reduced to NT − k, where k denotes the number of rating categories, and NT

the number firms in the portfolio at time T . There are two simple ways that identification can be
achieved. One could, for example, impose the same distance to default on all firms in the same
rating category, namely
λ̂j (T, T + H) − H µ̄j
√
= DDR (T, T + H) ∀j ∈ R,
σ̄ j H

(5)

where λ̂j (T, T + H) is default threshold estimated on the basis of information available at time T ,
and µ̄j and σ̄ j are sample estimates of (unconditional) mean and standard deviations of one-period
holding returns obtained over the period t = 1, 2, ..., T . Then with estimates of default frequencies
by rating in hand, namely π̂ R (T, T + H), we are able to obtain an estimate of DDR (T, T + H)
given by7
d R (T, T + H) = Φ−1 (π̂ R (T, T + H)) ,
DD

(6)

and hence the firm-specific default thresholds

√
λ̂j (T, T + H) = σ̄ j H Φ−1 (π̂ R (T, T + H)) + H µ̄j .

(7)

Note that imposing the same DD by rating as in (5) imposes the same unconditional P D for each
R-rated firm, as in (6), but allows for variation in the estimated default thresholds λ̂j (T, T + H)
across firms within a rating because of diﬀerent unconditional means and standard deviations of
returns, as in (7). Note also that each element on the right-hand-side of (7) is horizon dependent,
making the default threshold horizon dependent.
Alternatively, one could impose the restriction that the default threshold λ̂j (T, T + H) is the
same across firms in the same rating category:
λ̃j (T, T + H) = λ̂R (T, T + H) ∀j ∈ R,

(8)

which, when substituted into (4), now yields
π̂ R (T, T + H) =

(9)

Condition (5) implies that all firms with rating R have the same unconditional distance to default and hence the

same unconditional default probability, as in (6).

8

This is a non-linear equation that needs to be solved numerically for λ̂R (T, T + H). Condition
(9) implies that DD, and hence unconditional P Ds, will vary across firms within a rating, since
λ̂R (T, T +H) is chosen such that on average the P D by firm with rating R is equal to π̂ R (T, T +H).

2.2

Firm-Specific Conditional Defaults

For the credit risk analysis of diﬀerent shock scenarios it is important to distinguish between
conditional and unconditional default probabilities. For the conditional analysis we assume that
conditional on the information available at time t, Ωt , and as before the return of firm j in region i
and sector s over the period t to t + H, rjis (t, t + H) = ln (Ejis,t+H /Ejis,t ) , can be decomposed as
rjis (t, t + H) = µjis (t, t + H) + ξ jis (t, t + H),

(10)

where µjis (t, t + H) is the (forecastable) conditional mean (H-step ahead), and ξ jis (t, t + H) is
the (non-forecastable) component of the return process over the period t to t + H. It may contain
firm-specific idiosyncratic as well as systematic risk factor innovations. We shall assume that
£
¤
ξ jis (t, t + H) ∼ N 0, σ 2jis (t, t + H) .

(11)

We can now characterize the separation between a default and a non-default state with an indicator
variable zjis (t, t + H),
zjis (t, t + H) = I [rjis (t, t + H) < λjis (t, t + H)] ,

(12)

such that,
zjis (t, t + H) = 1 if rjis (t, t + H) < λjis (t, t + H) =⇒ Default,

(13)

zjis (t, t + H) = 0 if rjis (t, t + H) ≥ λjis (t, t + H) =⇒ No Default.
Using the same approach as above, the H-period ahead conditional default probability for firm j
is given by
π jis (t, t + H) = Φ

µ

λjis (t, t + H) − µjis (t, t + H)
σ jis (t, t + H)

¶

.

(14)

µjis (t, t + H) and σ jis (t, t + H) can be estimated using the firm-specific multi-factor regressions
using a sample ending in period T . In what follows we denote these estimates by µ̂jis (T, T +H) and
σ̂ jis (T, T + H), respectively. The default thresholds, λjis (T, T + H), can be estimated, following the
discussion in Section 2.1, by imposing either the same distance to default by rating, DDR (T, T +H),
as in (5), or the same default threshold by rating, as in (8). Specifically, under the same DD by
rating, the firm-specific conditional P D will be given by
Ã
!
√
σ̄ jis H Φ−1 [π̂ R (T, T + H)] + H µ̄jis − µ̂jis (T, T + H)
π̂ jis (T, T + H) = Φ
.
σ̂ jis (T, T + H)
9

(15)

Under the same default threshold by rating we have
Ã
!
λ̂R (T, T + H) − µ̂jis (T, T + H)
π̂ jis (T, T + H) = Φ
,
σ̂ ξjis (T, T + H)

(16)

where λ̂R (T, T + H) is determined by (9).
Similarly, in the case of the same DD by rating the empirical default condition for firm j with
credit rating R can now be written as
i
h
√
I rjis (T, T + H) < λ̂jis (T, T + H) = 1 if rjis (T, T + H) < σ̄ jis H Φ−1 [π̂ R (T, T + H)] + H µ̄jis ,

(17)

and in the case of the same default threshold by rating the default condition will be
i
h
I rjis (T, T + H) < λ̂R (T, T + H) = 1 if rjis (T, T + H) < λ̂R (T, T + H),

(18)

where as before λ̂R (T, T + H) is given as the solution to (9). Note that in the case of (18) there
are only as many default thresholds as there are credit ratings, whereas in the case of (17), each
default threshold is firm specific (through µ̄jis and σ̄ jis ).
Mappings from credit ratings to default probabilities are typically obtained using corporate
bond rating histories over many years, often 20 years or more, and thus represent averages across
business cycles. The reason for such long samples is simple: default events for investment grade
firms are quite rare; for example, the annual default probability even for an ‘A’ rated firm is
approximately one basis point for both Moody’s and S&P rated firms (see, for example, Jafry and
Schuermann (2004)). Accordingly, we will make the further identifying assumption that credit
ratings are "cycle-neutral", in the sense that ratings are assigned only on the basis of firm-specific
information and not on systematic or macroeconomic information. On this interpretation of credit
ratings also see Saunders and Allen (2002) and Amato and Furfine (2004).
Given suﬃcient data for a particular region or country i (the U.S. comes to mind) or sector
s, one could in principle consider default probabilities that vary over those dimensions as well.
However, since a particular firm j’s default is only observable once, multiple (serial) bankruptcies
notwithstanding, it makes less sense to allow π to vary across j.8 Empirically, then, we abstract
from possible variation in default rates across regions and sectors, so that probabilities of default
vary only across credit ratings and over time.
Finally, another important source of heterogeneity that could be of particular concern for our
multi-country analysis is the diﬀerences that prevail in bankruptcy laws and regulations across
8

To be sure, one is not strictly prevented from obtaining firm-specific default probabilities estimates at a given

point in time. The bankruptcy models of Altman (1968), Lennox (1999) and Shumway (2001) are such examples, as
is the industry model by KMV (Kealhofer and Kurbat (2002)). However, all of these studies focus on just one country
at a time (the U.S. and U.K in this list) and do not address the formidable challenges of point in time bankruptcy
forecasting with a multi-country portfolio.

countries. However, by using rating agency default data, which broadly speaking are based on
homogeneous definition of default, we expect our analysis to be reasonably robust to such heterogeneities.

Credit Loss Distribution9

3

The complicated relationship between return correlations and defaults manifests itself at the portfolio level. Consider a credit portfolio composed of N diﬀerent credit assets such as loans at date
t, and for simplicity assume that loss given default (LGD) is 100%, meaning that no recovery is
made in the event of default. Then we may define loss as a fraction of total exposure by

wj = 1/N . Full diversification is possible only in the extreme case where ρ∗ = 0 (which is implied
by ρ = 0), and assuming that the above granularity condition is satisfied.

The loss distribution associated with this homogeneous model is derived in Vasicek (1991,
2002) and Gordy (2000). Not surprisingly, Vasicek’s limiting (as N → ∞) distribution is also fully
determined in terms of π and ρ. The former parameter sets the expected loss of the portfolio, while
the latter controls the shape of the loss distribution. In eﬀect one parameter, ρ, controls all aspects
of the loss distribution: its volatility, skewness and kurtosis. It would not be possible to calibrate
two Vasicek loss distributions with the same expected and unexpected losses, but with diﬀerent
degrees of fat-tailedness, for example.12
Further, Vasicek’s distribution does not depend on the portfolio weights so long as (22) is
satisfied. Therefore, for suﬃciently large portfolios that satisfy the granularity condition, (22), there
is no further scope for credit risk diversification if attention is confined to the homogeneous return
model that underlies Vasicek’s loss distribution. Also, Vasicek’s set up does not allow conditional
risk modeling where the eﬀects of macroeconomic shocks on credit loss distribution might be of
interest. With these considerations in mind, we allow for systematic factors and heterogeneity
along several dimensions. These are: 1) multiple and observable factors, 2) firm fixed eﬀects, 3)
diﬀerentiated default thresholds, and 4) diﬀerentiated factor sensitivities (analogous to firm “betas”)
by region, sector or even firm-specific. If the Vasicek model lies at the fully homogeneous end of
the spectrum, the model laid out in Section 2 above describes the fully heterogeneous end. How
much does accounting for heterogeneity matter for credit risk? The outcomes we are interested in
exploring are diﬀerent measures of credit risk, be it means or volatilities of credit losses (expected
and unexpected losses in the argot of risk management), as well as quantiles in the tails or valueat-risk (VaR). Before we are able to answer some of these questions we first need to introduce the
macroeconomic or systematic risk model that we plan to utilize in our empirical analysis.

Conditional Credit Risk Modeling

4.1

The Macroeconomic Engine: GVAR

The conditional loss distribution of a given credit portfolio can be derived by linking up the return
processes of individual firms, initially presented in equation (10), explicitly to the macro and global
12

The literature on modeling correlated defaults has been growing enormously. For a recent survey, see Lando

(2004, ch. 9).

variables in the GVAR model. The macroeconomic engine driving the credit risk model is described
in detail in PSW. We only provide a very brief, non-technical overview here. The GVAR is a
global quarterly model estimated over the period 1979Q1-1999Q1 comprising a total of 25 countries
which are grouped into 11 regions, (shown in bold in Table 1 from PSTW, reproduced here for
convenience). The advantage of the GVAR is that it allows for a true multi-country setting;
however, it can become computationally demanding very quickly. For that reason we model the
seven key economies of the U.S., Japan, China, Germany, U.K., France and Italy as regions of their
own while grouping the other 18 countries into four regions.13 The output from these countries
comprises around 80% of world GDP (in 1999).
[Insert Table 1 about here]
In contrast to existing modeling approaches, in the GVAR the use of cointegration is not confined
to a single country or region. By estimating a cointegrating model for each country/region separately, the model also allows for endowment and institutional heterogeneities that exist across the
diﬀerent countries. Accordingly, specific vector error-correcting models (VECM) are estimated for
individual countries (or regions) by relating domestic macroeconomic variables such as GDP, inflation, equity prices, money supply, exchange rates and interest rates to corresponding, and therefore
country-specific, foreign variables constructed exclusively to match the international trade pattern
of the country/region under consideration. By making use of specific exogeneity assumptions regarding the ‘rest of the world’ with respect to a given domestic or regional economy, the GVAR
makes eﬃcient use of limited amounts of data and presents a consistently-estimated global model
for use in portfolio applications and beyond.14
The GVAR allows for interactions to take place between factors and economies through three
distinct but interrelated channels:
• Contemporaneous dependence of domestic on foreign variables and their lagged values;
• Dependence of country specific variables on observed common global eﬀects such as oil prices;
• Weak cross-sectional dependence of the idiosyncratic shocks.
The individual models are estimated allowing for unit roots and cointegration assuming that
region-specific foreign variables are weakly exogenous, with the exception of the model for the U.S.
economy which is treated as a closed economy model. The U.S. model is linked to the outside world
through exchange rates, which in turn are themselves determined by the rest of the region-specific
13
14

See PSW, Section 8, for details on cross-country aggregation into regions.
For a more updated version of the GVAR model which covers a longer period and a larger number of countries

see Dees, di Mauro, Pesaran and Smith (2005). This version also provides a theoretical framework where the GVAR
is derived as an approximation to a global unobserved common factor model.

13

models. PSW show that the careful construction of the global variables as weighted averages of the
other regional variables leads to a simultaneous system of regional equations that may be solved
to form a global system. They also provide theoretical arguments as well as empirical evidence in
support of the weak exogeneity assumption that allows the region-specific models to be estimated
consistently.
The conditional loss distribution of a given credit portfolio can now be derived by linking up
the return processes of individual firms, initially presented in equation (10), explicitly to the macro
and global variables in the GVAR model. We provide a synopsis of the model developed in full
detail in PSTW.

4.2

Firm Returns Based on Observed Common Factors Linked to GVAR

Here we extend the firm return model by incorporating the full dynamic structure of the systematic
risk factors captured by the GVAR. We present a notationally simplified version of the model
outlined in detail in PSTW. Accordingly, a firm’s return is assumed to be a function of changes in
the underlying macroeconomic factors (domestic and foreign), the exogenous global variables (in
our application oil prices) and the firm-specific idiosyncratic shocks η jis,t+τ :
rjis,t+τ = αjis + γ 0jis ft+τ + σ jis ηjis,t+τ , t = 1, 2, ..., T,

(23)

where η jis,t+τ v i.i.d.N (0, 1), τ = 1, 2, ..., H, rjis,t+τ is the equity return of firm j (j = 1, ..., nci ) in
region i and sector s, αjis is a regression constant (or firm “alpha”), γ jis are the factor loadings (firm
“betas”), and ft+τ collects all the observed macroeconomic variables plus oil prices in the global
model (totaling 64 in PSW). To be sure, these return regressions are not prediction equations per
se as they depend on contemporaneous variables.
The GVAR model provides forecasts of all the global variables that directly or indirectly aﬀect
the returns. As a result default correlation enters through the shared set of common factors,
ft+τ , and the factor loadings, γ jis . If the model captures all systematic risk, the idiosyncratic risk
components of any two companies in the model would be uncorrelated, namely the idiosyncratic
risks ought to be cross-sectionally uncorrelated. In practice, of course, it will be hard to absorb all
of the cross-section correlation with the systematic risk factors modeled by the GVAR.
Note that we started by decomposing firm returns into forecastable and non-forcastable components in (10), namely rjis (t, t + H) = µjis (t, t + H) + ξ jis (t, t + H). In the case of the above
specification we have
rjis (t, t + H) = Hαjis + γ 0jis

The composite innovation ξ jis (t, t + H) contains the idiosyncratic innovation ηjis,t+τ , and common
macro innovations from the GVAR, here represented by vt+τ , for τ = 1, 2, ..., H. The predictable
component is likely to be weak and will depend on the size of the factor loadings, γ jis , and the extent to which the underlying global variables are cointegrating. In the absence of any cointegrating
relations in the global model, none of the asset returns are predictable. As it happens the econometric evidence presented in PSW strongly supports the existence of 36 cointegrating relations in
the 63-equation global model and is, therefore, compatible with some degree of predictability in
asset returns, at least at the quarterly horizon modeled here. The extent to which asset returns
are predicted could reflect time-varying risk premia and does not necessarily imply market ineﬃciencies. Our modelling approach provides an operational procedure for relating excess returns of
individual firms to all the observable macro factors in the global economy.

4.3

Expected Loss Due to Default

Given the value change process for firm j, defined by (23), with µjis (T, T + H) and ξ jis (T, T + H)
by (25) and (26), and the return default threshold, λ̂R (T, T + H), obtainable from an initial credit
rating (see Section 2), we are now in a position to compute (conditional) expected loss. Suppose
we have data for firms and systematic factors in the GVAR for a sample period t = 1, ..., T. We
need to define the expected loss to firm j at time T + H given information available to the lender
(e.g. a bank) at time T, which we assume is given by ΩT . Default occurs when the firm’s return
falls below the return default threshold λ̂jis (T, T + H) or λ̃jis (T, T + H) defined by (7) and (8),
depending on the scheme used to identify the thresholds. Expected loss at time T (and realized at
T + H), ET (Ljis,T +H ) = E (Ljis,T +H | ΩT ) , is given by (using λ̃jis (T, T + H) = λ̂R (T, T + H), for

j ∈ R, for example) and
i
h
ET (Ljis,T +H ) = Pr ξ jis (T, T + H) < λ̃jis (T, T + H) − µjis (T, T + H) | ΩT ×Ajis,T ×ET (ϕjis,T +H ),
(27)

where Ajis,T is the exposure assuming no recoveries (typically the face value of the loan) and is
known at time T, and ϕjis,T +H is the percentage of exposure which cannot be recovered in the

event of default or loss given default (LGD). Typically ϕjis,T +H is not known at time of default
and is therefore treated as a random variable over the unit interval. In what follows we make the
simplifying assumption that LGD is 100%.
Substituting (23) into (27) we obtain:
ET (Ljis,T +H ) = π jis (T, T + H) × Ajis,T ,

assumption that the macro and the idiosyncratic shocks are normally distributed and that the
parameter estimates are given, we have the following expression for the probability of default over
T to T + H formed at T 16

H) and σ ξjis (T, T + H) in the case of the GVAR model are provided in the Supplement to PSTW.
The expected loss due to default of a loan (credit) portfolio can now be computed by aggregating
the expected losses across the diﬀerent loans. Denoting the loss of a loan portfolio over the period
T to T + H by LT +H we have
ET (LT +H ) =

where nci is the number of obligors (which could be zero) in the bank’s loan portfolio resident in
country/region i.
Finally note that, µjis,T is the explained or expected component of firm j’s return, obtained from
the multi-period GVAR forecasts which in general could depend on macroeconomic shocks worldwide. Thus, although individual firms operate in a particular country/region i, their probability of
default can be aﬀected by global macro economic conditions.
16

Joint normality is suﬃcient but not necessary for ξ jis (T, T + H) to be approximately normally distributed. This

is because ξ jis (T, T + H) is a linear function of a large number of weakly correlated shocks (63 in our particular
application).

Simulation of the Loss Distribution

The expected loss as well as the entire loss distribution can be computed once the GVAR model
parameters, the return process parameters in (23) and the thresholds using either (7) or (8), have
been estimated for a sample of observations t = 1, 2, ..., T . We do this by stochastic simulation
using draws from the joint distribution of the shocks, ξ jis (T, T + H), which is assumed to have a
conditional normal distribution with variance σ 2ξjis (T, T + H).

Note that Z0 is shared by all firms for a given draw b. Details on the derivation of ψ jis,H for
the GVAR model can be found in PSTW. The idiosyncratic portion of the innovation is comprised

5.1

An Empirical Application
The Credit Portfolio

To analyze the eﬀects of diﬀerent model specifications, parameter homogeneity versus heterogeneity,
we construct a fictitious large-corporate loan portfolio. This portfolio is an extended version of that
17

used in PSTW and is summarized in Table 2a. It contains a total of 243 companies, resident in 21
countries across 10 of the 11 regions in the GVAR model. In order for a firm to enter our sample,
several criteria had to be met. We restricted ourselves to major, publicly traded firms with a credit
rating from either Moody’s or S&P. Thus, for example, Chinese companies were not included for
lack of a credit rating. The firms should be represented within the major equity index for that
country. We favored firms for which equity return data was available for the entire sample period,
i.e. going back to 1979. Typically this would exclude large firms such as telephone operators which
in many instances have been privatized only recently, even though they may represent a significant
share in their country’s dominant equity index today. The data source is Datastream, and we took
their Total Return Index variable which is a cum dividend return measure.
The third column in Table 2a indicates the inception of the equity series available for the multifactor regressions. We allocated exposure roughly by share of output of the region (in our “world”
of 25 countries). Within a region, loan exposure is randomly assigned. Loss given default is assumed
to be 100% for simplicity. Table 2b provides summary information of the number of firms in the
portfolio by industry.
[Insert Tables 2a & 2b about here]
In order to obtain estimates for the rating-specific default frequencies (π̂ R,T +H|T ), we make use
of the rating histories from Standard & Poor’s spanning 1981-1999, roughly the same sample period
as is covered by our GVAR model. The results are presented in Table 3 below for the range of ratings
that are represented in our portfolio of firms, namely AAA to B. Empirical default probabilities,
π̂ R,T +τ , for τ = 1, 2, ..., H are obtained using default intensity-based estimates detailed in Lando
and Skødeberg (2002) and computed for diﬀerent horizons under the assumption that the credit
migrations are governed by a Markov process (in our application H = 4 quarters). This assumption
is reasonable for moderate horizons, up to about two years; see Bangia et al. (2002). Since S&P
rates only a subset of firms (in 1981 S&P rated 1,378 firms of which about 98% were U.S. domiciled;
by early 1999 this had risen to 4,910, about 68% U.S.), it is reasonable to assign a non-zero (albeit
very small) probability of default, even if the empirical estimate is zero. This is particularly relevant
if we wish to infer default behavior for a much broader set of firms than is covered by the rating
agencies. With this in mind, we impose a lower bound on the quarterly default frequency of 0.025
basis points per quarter or 0.1 basis points per annum. As can be seen in Table 3, this constraint is
binding only for the AAA rating. In this table we also show in parentheses the exposure share by
rating and the resulting EL. Based on the exposures in our portfolio, the (unconditional) expected

default (or loss under the maintained assumption of no recovery) over one year is 0.294% or 29.4bp
(basis points), bolded in the table.

5.2

Multi-factor Return Regressions: Specification, Estimation and Selection

With the GVAR framework serving as the global economic engine, multi-factor return regressions
are specified in terms of the observed macro factors in the GVAR model. A general form of these
return regressions is given by (23). Given the diverse nature of the firms in our portfolio, one
is tempted to include all the domestic, foreign and global factors (i.e. oil price changes) in the
multi-factor regressions. Such a general specification may be particularly important in the case
where a multinational is resident in one country, but the bulk of its operations takes place in the
global arena. However, because there is likely to be a high degree of correlation between some of the
domestic and foreign variables (in particular the domestic and foreign real equity prices), it is by no
means obvious that a general-to-specific model selection process would be appropriate, particularly
considering the short time series data available relative to the number of diﬀerent factors in the
GVAR.
An alternative model selection strategy, which we adopted in PSTW and follow in this paper,
is to view the 243 multi-factor regressions as forming a panel data model with heterogeneous
coeﬃcients. Such panels have been studied by Pesaran and Smith (1995) and Pesaran, Smith and
Im (1996) where it is shown that instead of considering firm-specific estimates one could base the
analysis on the means of the estimated coeﬃcients, referred to as the mean group estimates (MGE).
This approach assumes that the variations of factor loadings across firms in diﬀerent regions are
approximately randomly distributed around fixed means. This is the standard random coeﬃcient
model introduced into the panel literature by Swamy (1970) and used extensively in the empirical
literature.17 The choice of the factors in the multi-factor regressions can now be based on the
statistical significance of the (population) mean coeﬃcients by using the MGE to select a slimmeddown regressor set.18
The above factor selection procedure applied to the panel of 243 firms led to the following set
of factors: changes in domestic or foreign real equity prices, which we denote by ∆q̃i,t+1 , domestic
interest rate (∆ρi,t+1 ) and oil price changes (∆pot+1 ). We ran two sets of multi-factor regressions
(including the interest rate and oil price variables); one with ∆qi,t+1 (the domestic aggregate
∗ (the foreign country-specific equity return variable),
equity return variable) and another with ∆qit

and selected the regression with the higher R̄2 . For three-quarters of the portfolio (183 firms) the
domestic equity market return was chosen. This fully heterogeneous return equation (to be denoted
as model M0 ) is given by
rjis,t+1 = αjis + β 1,jis ∆q̃i,t+1 + β 2,jis ∆ρi,t+1 + β 3,jis ∆pot+1 + εjis,t+1 ,

(35)

where the idiosyncratic errors, εjis,t+1 , are assumed to be i.i.d.N (0, σ 2jis ). As credit rating information is used, default thresholds are computed using (7) and (8), depending on whether we fix DD

A recent review of the random coeﬃcient models is provided by Hsiao and Pesaran (2004).

or λ by rating.
The summary of the final set of multi-factor regressions of (35) and the associated MG estimates
are given in Table 4. In this specification changes in equity prices, interest rates and oil prices remain
the key driving factors in the multi-factor regressions.
[Insert Table 4 about here]
As is to be expected, the portfolio equity “beta” is highly significant, but somewhat below unity
at 0.918. An increase in the rate of interest results in a decline in firm returns while the overall eﬀect
of the oil price changes is positive. This seems a reasonable outcome for energy and petrochemical
companies and for some of the banks, although one would not expect this result to be universal. In
fact we do observe considerable variations in the individual estimates of the coeﬃcients of oil prices
changes across diﬀerent firms in our portfolio. In the final regressions, of the 243 firm regressions,
the coeﬃcient on oil price changes was positive for 144 firms (about 59% of the total), and negative
for the remaining firms. The MGE for each subset was also significant. A pooled estimate would,
of course, impose the same factor loadings, in this case positive, on all firms.19
The lack of other observable systematic risk factors entering the return model confirms that
most information relevant for firm returns is contained in the contemporaneous market return.
Only interest rates and oil prices changes provided marginal explanatory power. To be sure, when
forecasting the macroeconomic variables, and when conducting scenario analyses, the dynamics
of all the variables modeled in the GVAR (all 63 of them, plus oil prices) can still aﬀect returns
through their possible impacts on equity returns and interest rates. A direct presence in the firm
return equation is not necessary for real output, for example, to influence returns. Output shocks
influence returns and credit losses to the extent that real output, interest rates and stock market
returns are contemporaneously correlated.
In addition to the above fully heterogeneous specification, we also consider a number of specifications with diﬀering degrees of slope and error variance heterogeneity, but based on the same
three systematic factors (∆q̃i,t+1 , ∆ρi,t+1 , ∆pot+1 ). We consider the following additional models:
M1 (Fully Homogeneous Model): Pooled return equations with the same “alpha” and “beta”
across all 243 firms in the portfolio:
rjis,t+1 = α + β 1 ∆q̃i,t+1 + β 2 ∆ρi,t+1 + β 3 ∆pot+1 + εjis,t+1 ,

(36)

where the error variances are assumed to be the same for all firms, i.e. σ 2jis = σ 2ε ∀ jis.20
M2 (Firm Fixed Eﬀects): This is the standard fixed eﬀects specification:
rjis,t+1 = αjis + β 1 ∆q̃i,t+1 + β 2 ∆ρi,t+1 + β 3 ∆pot+1 + εjis,t+1 ,
19
20

Similarly for ∆ρi,t+1 , 38% of firms actually have a positive coeﬃcient.
The parameters α and β 0i are estimated by pooled OLS.

20

(37)

where the error variances are assumed to be the same for all firms, as in the model M1 .
M3 : (Industry/Sector Fixed and Marginal Eﬀects): This model imposes the same intercept (“alphas”) and slopes (“betas”) within an industry/sector but allows those parameters to
vary across industries:

all t, i and j. All firms within a given sector have the same error variance, but those variances are
allowed to vary across industries.
M4 : (Region Fixed and Marginal Eﬀects): In this model we impose the same intercept
(“alpha”) and slope (“beta”) within a region but allow those parameters to vary across regions.

to vary across regions.
Model M2 is arguably the simplest complication beyond a fully homogeneous model in that
it allows firm fixed eﬀects (firm “alphas”) but still imposes the same error variance on all firms.
Models M3 and M4 explore the impact of parameter (mean and variance) heterogeneity by industry
and region respectively.
Table 5 summarizes the regression results for the remaining models, M1 to M4 . The equity
factor loading is highly statistically significant (1% or better) across all models, and for the pooled
models, with or without a firm fixed eﬀect, M2 (0.869) and M1 (0.865) respectively, the coeﬃcient is
close to the MG estimate for the heterogeneous model, M0 (0.918). There is, however, considerable
variation across industries (M3 ) and regions (M4 ). For the industry model, the equity “beta”
is lowest for Communication, Electric & Gas and Non-durable Manufacturing, both 0.752, and
highest for FIRE (Finance, Insurance and Real Estate), 0.909. The sector equity “beta” closest to
the pooled model is Agriculture, Mining & Construction, 0.889.
[Insert Table 5 about here]
There is even more variation in the equity “beta” across regions, ranging from a low of 0.622 for
Latin America to a high of 1.926 for the Middle East, represented in our portfolio simply by four
21

Turkish firms and so should not be taken as typical.21 The second lowest “beta” was estimated
for Italy, 0.663, and the second highest for neighboring Germany, 1.165. Evidently geographic
proximity does not translate to similarity in equity betas, at least not for our portfolio. South East
Asia is closest to the pooled “beta” at 0.842.
Turning now to interest rate sensitivity, recall that the MGE of the interest rate variable for the
heterogeneous model is -2.990, meaning an increase in interest rates has an adverse eﬀect on firm
returns. This coeﬃcient is not significant for either of the pooled models, M1 and M2 , and it has the
wrong sign. Allowing for variation across sectors, M3 , results in significant and negative coeﬃcients
for FIRE, -5.590, and Wholesale & Retail Trade, -3.711. Just one of the positive coeﬃcients is
significant: 3.402 for Non-durable Manufacturing. Similar results are obtained in the case of Model
M4 , where the interest rate variable is statistically significant with a correct sign only in case of
US firms (-5.974), the Turkish firms in the Mid East region (-6.676), and South East Asia (-5.454).
Only one of the positive estimates is statistically significant, although it is small, and that is for
Latin America, 0.111.
The coeﬃcient on oil price changes is significant and positive for both pooled models, M1 (0.063)
and M2 (0.064), echoing the MGE for the heterogeneous model M0 (0.145). Recall, however, that
the MGE of the sub-groups with positive and negative coeﬃcients were also significant, suggesting
that firm-level heterogeneity for this factor loading may be particularly important. When grouping by industry or region, however, only the positive coeﬃcients are significant. Indeed, in the
indeustry/sector model, the coeﬃcient of the oil price variable is significant only for Communication, Electric & Gas, at 0.113. In the regional model it is significant for several regions, including
the U.S. (0.076), Germany (0.230), Mid East (2.341), which is not surprising, and Latin America
(1.035), although the oil exporter Venezuela is not part of our Latin American region.
From a model fit perspective, as measured by R̄2 , regional heterogeneity is more important
than industry heterogeneity: R̄2 = 0.171 for the former and 0.151 for the latter. Both are preferred
to just adding firm fixed eﬀects to the pooled model: the R̄2 for M2 is 0.148. By comparison, the
average R̄2 for the heterogeneous model M0 is 0.201; see Table 4.
Finally, we computed the average pair-wise cross-sectional return correlation across all firms
in our portfolio as well as of the residuals for each of the return specifications, M0 through M4 .
The average pair-wise cross-sectional return correlation turns out to be about 11.2%. While this
may seem low for equity returns, note first that returns are measured at relatively low frequency
— quarterly, and second that our portfolio is quite well diversified, with firms from 21 countries
grouped into 10 regions, and across all major industry groups. The three factors used in the five
model specifications are able to absorb a significant amount of the cross-firm dependence: the
average residual correlation ranges from 3.7% to 4% across the models.
21

The Middle East region did not include a domestic equity variable, so all return equations for the Turkish firms

include the foreign equity return variable, ∆qi,t+1

22

Another consideration in our comparative analysis is the extent to which the five alternative
parametric specifications aﬀect cross section correlations of the simulated returns. Since all the five
models are based on the same set of observed factors, cross section correlations of the simulated
returns will be aﬀected significantly by parameter heterogeneity only if the diﬀerences of parameters
across firms are systematic. In the case of pure random diﬀerences across slopes, it is easily seen
that all specifications would imply similar degrees of error cross correlations, and this is in fact true
in the present application.

Simulated Credit Loss Distributions

6.1

Unconditional and Conditional Loss

With the estimated GVAR model serving as the macroeconomic scenario generator and the fitted
multi-factor regressions as the linkage between firms and the global economy, we simulated loss
distributions one year ahead. We do this by first forecasting, out-of-sample, the evolution of
the 64 GVAR risk factors, using those forecasts and the risk factor loadings or return regression
coeﬃcients to compute firm return forecasts, and then seeing if that return forecast falls below the
default threshold. A one year horizon is typical for credit risk management and thus of particular
interest. We carried out 200,000 replications for each scenario, baseline as well as shock scenarios,
using Gaussian innovations.
The estimation period ends in 1999Q1, and we generate the loss distribution out of sample over
one year to the end of 2000Q1. The year over which the loss distribution is simulated turned out
to have been relatively benign for the firms in our portfolio when compared to the sample period
which we use to compute unconditional parameters such as expected returns and return volatilities.
The unconditional one-year portfolio return (i.e. the exposure weighted average return of all firms
in the portfolio) is 14.67%, whilst using the specification for the fully heterogeneous model M0 ,
the conditional portfolio return projected for the forecast year is 37.78%. This is reflected in the
diﬀerence between conditional and unconditional portfolio default (the same as expected loss, EL,
under the maintained assumption of no loss recovery). Recall from Table 3 that unconditional EL
is 0.294%, but conditional EL under the default threshold (λ) identifying assumption (8) is 0.096%,
and under the same distance to default (DD) assumption (5) is 0.089%.22 When we compare
the analytical to the simulated conditional portfolio default or expected loss, they are very close:
0.096% for same λ and 0.087% for same DD.
Fixing DD to be the same across firms by rating also fixes the unconditional default probability;
the two are isomorphic. Conditioning on return forecasts updates those probabilities. Fixing
22

The diﬀerences between the latter two estimates are due to rounding error arising from the inverse normal

transform on very small probabilities.

23

the default threshold λ by rating, however, allows for heterogeneity in the unconditional default
probabilities; they just need to be the same on average (see the discussion in Section 2.2). Those,
in turn, may be updated over time as conditioning information is incorporated. This firm-level
heterogeneity in unconditional probabilities of default (P D) can make a big diﬀerence empirically,
as is seen in Figure 1 which displays a scatter plot of unconditional (horizontal axis) and conditional
(vertical axis) one-year P Ds for the 243 firms in the portfolio. The top panel is for the same default
threshold (λ) by credit rating for all firms, while the bottom panel is for the same distance to default
(DD) by credit rating for all firms. The axes on both charts are scaled to be directly comparable.
We see immediately in the top panel that conditional and unconditional P Ds are not only widely
dispersed, reflective of the underlying firm level heterogeneity, but also highly correlated (ρ = 0.961).
By contrast the same DD by rating chart (bottom panel) has both the unconditional and conditional
P Ds tightly clustered in a narrow range. As there are six credit ratings represented in this study,
so we see six vertical lines, where the vertical scatter represents the variation in conditional P D by
rating (all having the same unconditional P D, of course) resulting in a lower correlation between
unconditional and conditional P Ds (ρ = 0.790). In contrast to same λ, the P Ds implied by same
DD change dramatically through conditioning (or updating). These diﬀerences will become more
explicit and pronounced in the loss distributions across the model specifications, an issue we address
next.

6.2

Model Heterogeneity and Baseline Losses

In moving from the most homogeneous model M1 to M2 , we add heterogeneity in the conditional
mean by allowing for firm fixed eﬀects, as well as heterogeneity in the unconditional probability of
default, namely by introducing credit rating information. To isolate the eﬀects of these relaxations
of the homogeneity restrictions, we add an intermediate model which augment model M1 with credit
rating information. Consequently we denote M1a to be the homogeneous model without the use of
rating information, and M1b the homogeneous model that allows for credit ratings in determination
of the default thresholds.
HPS provide theoretical results and empirical support showing that neglecting parameter heterogeneity can lead to underestimation of expected losses (EL). But once EL is controlled for,
neglecting parameter heterogeneity can lead to overestimation of unexpected losses or risk. Their
results are not sensitive to the choice of identification restrictions.
Table 6 gives summary statistics for the baseline (i.e. no risk factor shocks) loss distribution
for all models, with the top panel imposing the same threshold, λ, identifying restriction, and the
bottom panel the same distance to default, DD, restriction. We show the first four moments as
well as three tail quantiles or values-at-risk (VaR): 99.0%, 99.5% and 99.9%, corresponding to levels
24

commonly used by risk managers, and in the last case, the risk tolerance level of the New Basel
Capital Accord (BCBS (2004)).
[Insert Table 6 about here]
Looking first at the top panel, EL and UL vary significantly across the diﬀerent specifications,
both increasing as we increase model heterogeneity. However, as shown in HPS, it is important that
the diﬀerences in EL’s across the diﬀerent portfolios are taken into account, before implications of
heterogeneity for unexpected losses can be evaluated. There is no obvious way that this can be
done. Here we normalize risk, whether measured by unexpected loss (UL) or VaR, by EL. We shall
refer to these as EL multiples.
The results in Table 6 show that it takes about 21 EL multiples to obtain one standard deviation
of losses for the most homogeneous model M1a , just 11 for the industry model M3 , and only 2.5
for the fully heterogeneous model M0 . The third and fourth moments, skewness and kurtosis
respectively, also decline when more heterogeneity is allowed for. Imposing homogeneity results in
overly skewed and fat-tailed loss distributions. This point becomes quite clear when looking at the
99.9% VaR: model M1a and M1b have EL multiples in excess of 300, while the regional model M4
has a multiple of only 54 and the fully heterogeneous model M0 only 21, less than one-tenth of the
most homogeneous model.
An important source of heterogeneity turns out to be the credit rating which influences, among
other things, the default threshold. Adding credit ratings to the homogeneous specification, model
M1b , results in a noticeable drop in EL multiples: UL/EL drops from 20.8 to 17.1, and 99.9%
VaR from 382 to 305. Adding firm fixed eﬀects, model M2 , does not help; in fact risk seems to
increase slightly, although this could be due to simulation errors. We need to allow for variation
in factor loadings, either by industry, model M3 , or region, model M4 , before EL multiples decline
further. These findings are in line with the results reported in HPS: the factor that changes the
shape of the loss density the most is the use of information on credit ratings in construction of
the loss distribution. Considering that the New Basel Capital Accord is centered around more
careful modeling of credit ratings, either internal or external, this emphasis seems well placed
indeed. A similar pattern holds when looking at value at risk. In this regard regional heterogeneity
seems to play a more important role than industry heterogeneity, perhaps not surprising given the
international nature of this portfolio.23
Turning to the bottom panel, where the loss distributions are simulated under the same DD
identifying restriction, diﬀerences across model specifications are much more muted. The results
for the heterogeneous model M0 are broadly in line with its same λ counterpart in the top panel
(EL and UL, and VaR are similar). However, EL decreases as we increase the degree of parameter
23

We tried a diﬀerent industry specification using 10 instead of 6 groups to match the number of parameters in the

regional model (there are 10 regions). This did not change our conclusions.

25

heterogeneity. Moreover, there is little diﬀerence in EL multiples, whether looking at loss volatility
(UL) or VaR. In fact, the results would suggest that increased heterogeneity actually increases risk:
UL/EL for M1a is 1.4 and for M0 is 3.0. Further, 99.9% VaR, normalized by EL, is 11 for M1a and
28 for M0 .
These results diﬀer both from those under the same threshold identifying restriction and from
those reported in HPS for the same DD restrictions. Under the same DD assumption, the actual
default threshold used in the simulations is firm-specific, and is computed using firm-specific estimates for unconditional expected returns and their standard deviations. Since the sample period
is short for several firms, we may have rather poor estimates of the unconditional moments. The
same λ assumption implies varying DDs (and hence unconditional P Ds) across firms within a
rating category, although importantly they average out to match the rating-specific unconditional
P D. In the absence of reliable estimates of unconditional means and volatilities of firm returns,
the resulting firm-specific default thresholds are likely be rather noisy. In light of these results, and
the previous discussion of unconditional and conditional P Ds, in the remaining analysis we focus
on the same threshold (λ) identifying restrictions.
Before proceeding to the shock scenarios, it may be of interest to compare the simulated UL
to that implied by the Vasicek model as discussed in Section 3. This asymptotic expression, given
in (21), is driven by the average default rate across the portfolio, π, and the default correlation,
ρ∗ , itself a function of π and the average return correlation of the firms in the portfolio, ρ, which
is 11.2% for our portfolio; see (20) in Section 3. Thus using the unconditional portfolio default
rate from Table 3, π = 0.294%, this yields a default correlation of ρ∗ = 0.470% and an asymptotic
p
U L = π(1 − π)ρ∗ = 0.371%, which is above the simulated UL of all models. However, those
simulated ULs are conditional, not unconditional, and if we substitute the simulated (conditional)
EL (which, under the maintained assumption of no loss recovery, is identical to π), all asymptotic
UL values are below their simulated counterparts, as they should be, assuming that the average
return correlation ρ remains unchanged. For example, in the case of model M0 , π = 0.094%, so
that ρ∗ = 0.208% . In that case asymptotic U L = 0.140% which is below the simulated UL of
0.239%. The diﬀerence is clearly due to granularity, an issue we pick up in Section 6.5 below.
[Insert Figure 2 about here]
In Figure 2 we compare the simulated loss distributions across model specifications. The top
panel displays the 20% tail (80th percentile and beyond) and the bottom panel focuses on the 5% tail.
The tail of that loss distribution rises earlier and more gradually for the most heterogeneous model
M0 , and late and suddenly for the more homogeneous models. We see that the fully heterogeneous
model in particular accumulates losses much earlier in the distribution, already by about the 82nd
percentile, than the other models. Significant losses are not seen until about the 95th percentile

26

for the regional model M4 , not until after the 97th percentile for the industry model M3 , and well
beyond the 99th percentile for all other models.

6.3

Model Heterogeneity and Risk Factor Shocks

One of the main advantages of our conditional modeling approach is that it allows us to consider
the impact of diﬀerent macroeconomic or risk factor shock scenarios. The ability to conduct shock
scenario analysis with observable risk factors is clearly important for policy analysis, be it business
or public policy.
Recall that the risk factors in the firm return models are equity returns, interest rates and
oil prices. In addition we shall explore the impact of business cycle heterogeneity across diﬀerent
countries by considering shocks to real output, which (as noted earlier) can influence the loss
distributions indirectly through their contemporaneous correlations with equity returns and interest
rates. Accordingly we examined the following equiprobable scenarios, though others are possible,
of course:24
• a ±2.33σ shock to real U.S. equity, corresponding to a quarterly change of ±14.28% from the
baseline forecast,25

• a +2.33σ shock to the German short term interest rate, corresponding to a quarterly rise of
0.33%,

• a −2.33σ shock to real U.S. output, corresponding to a quarterly drop of 1.85%.
In order to learn more about the tail properties of the various loss distributions, we also consider
an extreme stress scenario for the U.S. equity market as reported in PSTW, namely an adverse
shock of 8.02σ. This corresponds to a quarterly drop of 49% which is the largest quarterly drop in
the S&P 500 index since 1928, and that occurred over the three months to May of 1932. Finally,
we include an intermediate negative equity shock of −5σ which corresponds to a quarterly decline

of 30.64%. Details of how the macroeconomic shocks are generated and how they feed through firm
returns to the loss distribution can be found in PSTW.
[Insert Table 7 about here]
We start the discussion with a ±2.33σ shock to real U.S. equity under the same threshold,

λ, restriction, summarized in Table 7. For each model we repeat the baseline results for ease of
comparison and display the percentage increase (decrease) from that baseline of EL, UL and 99.9%
24

2.33σ corresponds, in the Gaussian case, to the 99% Value-at-Risk (VaR), a typical benchmark in risk manage-

ment.
25
Relative to historic averages, this shock corresponds to a rise (drop) of 17.95% (11.35%), computed as
exp (2.23% ± 14.28%) − 1.

27

VaR. For each model, the percentage increase in EL and UL arising from the adverse shock is
always larger than the corresponding decline in losses due to a benign shock. Consider model M1a :
EL (UL) increases by 172% (73%) under the adverse shock and decreases by 67% (48%) under the
benign shock. The size of those impacts declines as we allow for more heterogeneity. The regional
model M4 , for instance, shows an increase in EL (UL) of 88% (42%) from the adverse shock against
a decline of 46% (29%) from the benign shock. The smallest impact can be seen from the most
heterogeneous model, M0 : the adverse shock increases EL (UL) by 51% (31%) and the benign shock
decreases EL (UL) by 31% (21%).
This asymmetric and non-proportional response of credit losses to symmetric shocks is due to the
nonlinearity of the credit risk model. When focussing on the tails of the loss distribution, however,
only the fully heterogeneous model M0 exhibits this particular asymmetric response, namely that
risk reductions are proportionately less than risk increaes due to an adverse and benign shock,
respectively. For all other model specifications the opposite seems to be true: the reduction in
99.9% VaR arising from the benign shock is larger than the corresponding increase in 99.9% VaR
due to the adverse shock. Thus, by imposing homogeneity, not only are the relative loss responses
exaggerated (all the percentage increases and decreases are larger for the restricted than for the
unrestricted model), but perceived reduction in risk in the tail of the loss distribution tends to be
overly optimistic.
Finally, note that an adverse shock results in less skewed and fat-tailed loss distributions, relative
to their respective baselines, across all models, and conversely a benign shock renders them more
extreme. The adverse (benign) shock results in more (fewer) firms defaulting systematically due
to the displacement of expected (i.e. forecast) returns, before any additional idiosyncratic risk is
accounted for. As a result an adverse (benign) shock shifts probability mass of the loss distribution
closer to (farther from) the mean. The eﬀects of the shocks on the shape of the loss distribution is
quite large for relatively homogeneous models, and much more modest for heterogeneous ones. For
instance, the skewness (kurtosis) for M1a decreases to 19.4 (537) under the adverse shock compared
to the baseline, 29.4 (1200), but increases to 38.0 (1652) under the benign shock. By contrast, the
skewness and kurtosis decreases to 5.1 and 37, respectively, for the regional model, M4 , under the
adverse shock scenario as compared to the baseline values of 6.5 and 56, but increases to 8.4 and
86 under the benign shock scenario, respectively. The relative impact is, of course, even smaller for
the fully heterogeneous model, M0 .
The evidence thus far suggests that heterogeneity is important in controlling risk both under
a baseline forecast and under shock scenarios. Allowing for regional heterogeneity appears to be
more important than allowing for industry or sector heterogeneity. Both the baseline and shockconditional loss distributions seem to change noticeably with the addition of heterogeneous factor
loadings, i.e. starting with model M3 . However, the biggest marginal change arises when allowing
for full heterogeneity with model M0 .
28

Next we consider an adverse shock to German interest rates. Naturally we could have shocked
interest rates of other countries, e.g. the U.S., but since we already have other U.S.-based shock
scenarios, we wanted to broaden the discussion by considering shocks to other countries’ macroeconomic factors. Interest rate shocks are of particular interest in our modeling context because the
corresponding factor loading is positive, but insignificant, for the pooled models M1 and M2 , on
average negative and significant for the heterogeneous model M0 , and rather mixed for the industry
and regional models, M3 and M4 .
[Insert Table 8 about here]
The loss simulation results are summarized in Table 8. Compared with adverse U.S. equity
shocks, the impact on credit losses due to an equiprobable adverse shock to German interest rates
is more modest. EL increases on average by only about 24%, UL by only 12%, and 99.9% VaR by
around 5%. Here too we see a similar model ranking as before, with the most homogeneous model
M1a being the most shock sensitive, at least when measured by EL and UL impact, and the most
heterogeneous model M0 the least shock sensitive. The impact on 99.9% VaR is modest, and given
parameter uncertainty, broadly similar across the diﬀerent model specifications.
Even though the factor loading on interest rates is positive, albeit small and not significant,
for the pooled models M1a , M1b and M2 , losses still increase in reaction to an adverse interest rate
shock. Because of the complicated inter-dependencies that exist in the GVAR model, shocking
one of the factors will potentially impact all the other 62 factors. As a result the overall eﬀect of
the shock on the loss distribution need not have the same sign as the coeﬃcient of the factor in
the return equation. Consequently an adverse interest rate shock may have the counter-intuitive
benign direct eﬀect on firm returns in the pooled return regressions, but the intuitive adverse
indirect eﬀects through the equity return factor.
With this in mind we consider the eﬀects of an adverse shock to real U.S. output. Recall that
output does not enter the firm return regressions; however, shocks in output may enter indirectly
through the other variables such as interest rates and equity prices. We summarize those results
in Table 9 and notice immediately that the changes from the baseline are of the "wrong" sign but
quite small and are unlikely to be statistically significant. One year after the shock, credit losses
are projected to actually decline somewhat. Average decline in EL across models is about 5%, the
decline in UL is about 3%, and the decline in 99.9% VaR about 2% relative to the baseline loss
distribution. In Section 6.4 below we explore whether including output directly in the firm-specific
return regressions makes any diﬀerence.
[Insert Table 9 about here]
Finally, we consider the eﬀect of extreme risk factor shocks on the resulting distribution of
credit losses under diﬀerent model specifications. Table 10 presents results from two diﬀerent U.S.
29

real equity shock scenarios: −5.00σ in Panel A and −8.02σ in Panel B, the latter matching the
largest quarterly drop in the S&P 500 index since 1928. To be sure, a shock as extreme as −8.02σ

is, of course, outside the bounds of the estimated model. It would be unreasonable to believe that
such a large shock would not result in changes to the underlying parameters. However, it is still
instructive to examine the impact of an extreme shock, one way one might stress a credit risk
model. Moreover, 5σ events are more common at higher frequencies than the quarterly data we
have available to us, and in this way our results will likely underestimate the true loss outcomes.
[Insert Table 10 about here]
Under the −5σ shock scenario, shown in Panel A, increases in expected losses across models

range from eleven-fold (1035%) (M2 ) to nine-fold (794%) (M1a ) to just 154% (M0 ). UL increases
for the same models are about three and a half-fold for M1a (244%) and M2 (266%) and not quite
double for M0 (85%). Diﬀerences in the tail impact at the 99.9% level are not as extreme: 150%
for M1a , 107% for M2 and 83% for M0 . As the shock becomes more extreme and takes the value of
−8.02σ, the diﬀerent shock sensitivities of the models, as measured, for instance, by 99.9% VaR,

become even more apparent. See Panel B in Table 10. Increases in VaR values relative to baseline
losses are less than 200% for models M0 and M4 , and nearly 400% for model M1a . The broad
pattern observed so far holds: the more restrictive (homogeneous) the model, the more sensitively
it reacts to shock scenarios.
[Insert Figure 3 about here]
As the shock becomes more extreme to −8.02σ, the resulting loss distribution for all models

becomes less skewed and fat-tailed, as measured by kurtosis. To see this graphically we generated
density plots for model M0 , presented in Figure 3, where we display the simulated loss densities for
the baseline, the symmetric ±2.33σ shocks and the two severe adverse shocks to U.S. real equity

prices. The ordering of the shocks is clearly seen in the plot around the 1% portfolio loss point:
from benign and lowest density to most adverse and highest density.

6.4

Business Cycle Shocks: An Alternative Model Specification

The return regressions used in the above simulation exercises do not select the growth rate of real
output as a risk factor. As noted earlier this might not be that surprising as the eﬀects of business
cycle fluctuations on firm returns could have already been incorporated indirectly through market
returns. It is, however, possible that the factor selection and the subsequent model estimation
could have been biased due to the use of country-specific asset return variables, particularly in the
case of countries with relatively small asset markets.26
26

Recall that the estimates of the output eﬀects are obtained by regression of firm-specific returns on the market

returns, output growth and other variables such as changes in the interest rates and oil prices. Since market returns

30

With this in mind, and following the work of Kapetanios and Pesaran (2004), we proceeded
to estimate an alternative version of the fully heterogeneous model which includes a global equity
return, ∆q̄t+1 , defined as the cross-sectional average of all equity indices in the GVAR model
instead of the country-specific market returns, ∆q̃i,t+1 used in (35). We then run this version of
the return regression augmented with real output growth for region i, denoted by ∆yi,t+1 , and the
other variables, namely changes in interest rates (∆ρi,t+1 ) and oil prices (∆pot+1 ):27
rjis,t+1 = αjis + β 1,jis ∆q̄t+1 + β 2,jis ∆ρi,t+1 + β 3,jis ∆pot+1 + β 4,jis ∆yi,t+1 + ξ jis,t+1 .

(40)

The MGE results for the alternative specification (40) using PPP weights are given in Table 11.
These new estimates attribute a smaller eﬀect to market returns with the average market ”beta”
falling from 0.918 to 0.780 and the interest rate eﬀects rising (in absolute value) from −2.99 to

−4.236. The average eﬀect of real output growth on firm returns is also statistically significant and
has the correct sign, which contrasts with the earlier results based on country-specific equity market

returns. The average eﬀects of oil price changes, although still positive, are no longer statistically
significant. The change in the estimates as a result of using ∆q̄t+1 instead of ∆q̃i,t+1 are in line
with a priori expectations and could be explained by a positive correlation between the countryspecific market returns and the errors in the firm-specific return regressions. This is also reflected
in the estimates of the in-sample fit of the return regressions where the avg. R̄2 declines from 0.201
to 0.103 as we move from ∆q̃i,t+1 to ∆q̄t+1 . The decline in the fit is quite substantial and could
be an important consideration in the choice between the alternative specifications, although any
simultaneity arising from inclusion of ∆q̃i,t+1 could in itself result in an upward bias in the avg. R̄2 .
[Insert Table 11 about here]
Bearing in mind the uncertainty associated with these alternative specifications, the loss simulations based on the new return regressions for the baseline scenario as well as for the 2.33σ shock
scenarios are summarized in Table 12. These simulations can be viewed as providing a check on the
robustness of the loss simulation results obtained so far. Baseline loss behavior is only somewhat
diﬀerent from M0 (see last row of Table 6, top panel), but importantly it is closer than any of the
other restricted models, even though their in-sample goodness of fit was higher. When we examine
the impact of shocks, even though real output now directly enters the firm return regressions, the
impact of an adverse shock to real U.S. output growth is very similar to the previous specification:
are in eﬀect weighted averages of the firm-specific returns, the return regressions could yield biased estimates if the
market return happens to be based on a relatively few firms.
27
This cross-sectional average may be either equal weighted or PPP-weighted. We experimented with both. In the
latter case we used PPP weights from 1996, the same weights used in the GVAR to construct regions from countries.
There were little diﬀerences in the result, and in what follows we focus on the estimates based on the PPP-weighted
global real equity index.

31

it is both small and of the wrong sign. Meanwhile the impact of the other shocks are similar in this
as in the original specification.
[Insert Table 12 about here]
Although the average loading on output is positive, statistically significant and large at 0.7, it
turns out that about half (45%) of the firms actually have a negative coeﬃcient (loading) on output.
Indeed when we look at the MGE of the positive and negative subsets, they are both significant.
Hence it is not surprising that for our portfolio, the net impact of an adverse shock to output is
about zero. Of course, if the portfolio were comprised only of firms with a positive loading, credit
losses would likely increase in the event of an adverse output shock.
As far as loss distributions are concerned, our overall conclusions seem to be robust to the choice
of the firm-specific return regressions.

Idiosyncratic Risk and Granularity

Portfolio-level results of credit risk models such as those discussed in Vasicek (1987, 2002) assume
that the portfolio is suﬃciently large that all idiosyncratic risk has been diversified away. More
generally we consider a credit portfolio composed of N diﬀerent credit assets such as loans, each with
exposures or weights wi , for i = 1, 2, .., N , such that the granularity condition (22) holds. Recall
¢
¡
that a suﬃcient condition for (22) to hold is given by wi = O N −1 .28 The lower the average firm
return correlation, the greater the potential for diversification, but a larger N is required to attain
that limit if correlations are lower. A common rule of thumb for return diversification of a portfolio
of equities is N ≈ 50. But as seen in Section 6.2, default correlations are much lower than return
correlations, meaning that more firms are needed to reach the diversification limits of credit risk.

Thus it seems reasonable to ask if a portfolio of N = 243 is large enough to diversify away the
idiosyncratic risk. To answer this question we used an empirical version of the one-factor Vasicek
model described in Section 3 and analyzed the impact of increasing N on simulated compared to
analytic (asymptotic) unexpected loss (UL). For simulation purposes, Vasicek’s model takes the
following form:
rj,t+1 = r̄ + σ f ft+1 + σ ε εj,t+1 ,
where r̄ =

Conditions (22) on the portfolio weights was in fact embodied in the initial proposal of the New Basel Accord

in the form of the Granularity Adjustments which was designed to mitigate the eﬀects of significant single-borrower
concentrations on the credit loss distribution. See Basel Committee (2001, Ch.8).

(44)

For our portfolio, for the one-year horizon we have the following parameter values: r̄ = 13.356%,

σ̂ f = 11.230%, σ̂ ε = 34.856%, π̂ = 0.294%, so that the implied average return correlation ρ =
9.404%, with an associated default correlation of ρ∗ = 0.369%.29 Substituting these values in (44)
obtains a one-year return default threshold of −87.51%, meaning that any firm that experiences a
one-year return worse than −87.51% would default.

Calibrating Vasicek’s model to these parameters we simulated losses assuming diﬀerent portfolio

granularity, ranging from 119 to 10,000 firms. To be sure, all firms share the same draw of the
systematic factor f and the same default threshold lambda, while each firm carries idiosyncratic risk
(reflected by firm-specific draws from εj,t+1 v N (0, 1)). Idiosyncratic risk should diversify away,
with the simulated UL approaching the analytic UL as the number of firms increases.
The results are summarized in Table 13. The result for N = 119 relates to the number of firms
in the PSTW portfolio. By more than doubling N we cut idiosyncratic risk nearly in half. But to
come within 3% of the asymptotic UL of the portfolio, more than 5,000 firms are needed! Thus
credit portfolios or credit derivatives such as CDOs which contains rather fewer number of firms
will likely still retain a significant degree of idiosyncratic risk, an observation also made by Amato
and Remolona (2004).

Concluding Remarks

In this paper we have made use of a conditional credit risk model with observable risk factors,
developed in Pesaran, Schuermann, Treutler and Weiner (2004), to explore several dimensions of
credit risk diversification: across industries (sectors) and across diﬀerent countries or regions, either
in a relatively restrictive fixed eﬀects return specification, or by allowing for full firm-level heterogeneity. Specifically, we fix the number of risk factors — there are three: market equity returns and
29

The relationship between ρ and ρ∗ is given by (20).

changes in domestic interest rates and oil prices — and only vary the degree of parameter heterogeneity across models. We find that full firm-level parameter heterogeneity matters a great deal for
capturing diﬀerences in simulated credit loss distributions. Expected loss (EL) increases as more
heterogeneity is allowed for. However, unexpected losses, normalized by EL, decline dramatically.
Moreover, imposing homogeneity results in overly skewed and fat-tailed loss distributions.
These diﬀerences become more pronounced in the presence of shocks to systematic risk factors.
The most restricted model which imposes the same factor sensitivities across all firms is overly
sensitive to such shocks, and thus failing to properly account for parameter heterogeneity could
result in too much implied risk capital. Allowing for regional parameter heterogeneity seems to
better approximate the loss distributions generated by the fully heterogeneous model than allowing
just for industry heterogeneity.
Our findings have a number of implications for both public and private (or business) policy.
For example, in the case of a bank’s risk management practices, neglected heterogeneity resulting
in underestimation of expected losses would cause a bank to underprovision for (expected) losses.
Furthermore, the resulting overestimation of unexpected losses would cause a bank to hold too
much capital. Another example is the structuring and pricing of collateralized debt obligations
(CDOs). These increasingly popular and widespread credit instruments are structured, and priced,
by segmenting the loss distribution into risk tranches. We have shown that the shape of the
loss distribution is aﬀected significantly under neglected heterogeneity, in which case the resulting
pricing and risk assessment would in turn be significantly aﬀected. Related, our analysis shows that
the size of the portfolio needed to eliminate most of the idiosyncratic risk, and thus fully exploit the
diversification potential which exists in credit portfolios, may be in the thousands. This is sobering
considering that most CDOs rarely contain more than 100 names. Finally, the relative insensitivity
of credit risk to business cycle shocks under alternative model specifications, could be important
in the current debate over the pro-cyclicality of the New Basel Accord.
The results raise a number of questions and issues that merit further exploration. Our portfolio,
by virtue of being allocated across 21 countries in 10 regions, is already quite diversified as evidenced
by an average cross-sectional pair-wise return correlation of 11.2%. Concentrating all of the nominal
exposure into just one region or one industry would undoubtedly have significant impact on the
resulting loss distribution, in addition to yielding diﬀerences across models. A diﬃculty one would
quickly encounter in exploring this problem are the rating or default probability diﬀerences across
those dimensions. The average rating in the U.K., for instance, is much higher than for the
Latin American obligors, especially if one follows the rule that an obligor rating cannot exceed
the sovereign rating.30
It is also worth exploring the impact of fat-tailed innovations on the resulting loss distributions.
30

This rule seems quite reasonable when one considers debt denominated in, say, USD (or euros), but perhaps less

so if the debt is exclusively in the local currency.

34

The current application is limited to the double-Gaussian assumption (both idiosyncratic and
systematic innovations are normal), but it seems reasonable to relax this assumption by considering,
say, draws from Student-t distributions with low degrees of freedom.

Simulated one year ahead loss distributions for all return model specifications using 200,000 simulations. Details on the return specifications for
models M0 to M4 are given in Section 5.2. Table compares two alternative identification restrictions: top panel imposes the same return default
threshold, λ, by rating when rating information is used (this is the case for all models except M1a), while bottom panel imposes the same distance to
default, DD, by rating when rating information is used.

Figure 3: Comparing simulated loss densities across different shocks to U.S. real equity prices, fully heterogeneous
model M0 imposing the same default threshold λ identifying condition, 200,000 simulations. All densities are
estimated with an Epanechnikov kernel using Silverman’s (1986) optimal bandwidth. The vertical axis is cropped
at the top (hence the up-arrow) to allow for better visualization of the different densities; most of the loss
density is at or very near the origin. The ordering of the shocks is clearly seen in the plot around the 1%
portfolio loss point: from benign and lowest density to most adverse and highest density.
