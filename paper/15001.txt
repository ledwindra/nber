The Impact of State-Level Nutrition-Education Program Funding on BMI: Evidence from
the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System

ABSTRACT
Currently, there is insufficient evidence regarding which policies will improve nutrition, reduce BMI,
the probability of obesity and the probability of overweight nationwide. This preliminary study investigates
the impact of a nutrition-education policy relative to price policy as a means to improve nutrition and
reduce BMI. Model estimations are created with pooled cross-sectional data from the Centers for Disease
Control’s (CDC), Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), American Chamber of Commerce
Research Association (ACCRA) state-level food prices and the United States Department of Agriculture’s
(USDA) funding of state-specific nutrition-education programs from 1992 – 2006. During this period,
federal funding for state-specific nutrition-education programs rose from approximately $600 thousand
for a few states to nearly $248 million for all states. After controlling for state fixed effects, year effects
and a state specific linear time trend, I find that nutrition education spending has the intended effect
for individuals from certain, but not all, income and education-levels. Also, the results indicate that
increasing the price of food purchased for consumption away from home is consistent with decreasing
BMI, obesity and overweight for the lowest income groups. However, the overall effect is minimal.

Introduction
The average US Body Mass Index (BMI), defined as weight in kilograms divided by

height in meters squared (kg/m2), has increased dramatically since the 1980s. Due to this
rise, more Americans are classified as overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m2) and obese (BMI > 30
kg/m2). This increase has serious implications for the state of national health. A substantial
amount of cross-disciplinary research has investigated the potential reasons for the increase.
The economics literature attributes the dramatic increase with the hypothesis: the increase in
average BMI is the result of economic changes that alter Americans’ preferences for exercise
and high calorie, low-nutrient food and drinks (Philipson, 2001; Lakdawalla and Philipson,
2002; Cawley,1999; Cutler, Glaeser and Shapiro, 2003; Chou, Grossman and Saffer, 2004).
To determine the impact of relative prices, more targeted economic research has
investigated the impact of food prices and income levels (Auld and Powell, 2008; Beyoun,
Powell, Yuan, 2008; Goldman, Lakdawalla, and Zheng, 2009), restaurant location and
advertising (Chou, Rashad and Grossman, 2008; Rashad, Grossman, Chou, 2006), and
prices of non-food items (e.g., soda prices) on BMI and obesity prevalence (Fletcher, Frisvold,
Tefft, 2010). These studies all indicate technological change causes reductions in food and
non-food prices and increases in access to high-calorie, low-nutrient food, which then shifts
the nutritional content of processed food and the nutritional choices of Americans. To
incentivize proper nutrition, economic policy typically alters the price of and/or access to lowpriced foods that offer lower nutritional content. However, invoking policies affecting access
or price may result in regressive effects that disproportionately and negatively impact those
who are more disadvantaged or part of a lower income group. For this reason, other

1

strategies that directly target consumer information may be more effective in reducing
demand without imposing regressive losses on the most economically vulnerable.
This paper offers a preliminary study of the impact of federal spending on nutritioneducation programs on BMI, obesity and overweight. Despite a wealth of research on
nutrition-education programs from other disciplines, such as public health and nutrition, the
current economic literature fails to provide an economic analysis that compares different
policies and their overall effects on BMI, obesity and overweight. This paper contributes to
the economic literature in two ways. First, it investigates the impact of nutrition education
policy on individual-level weight outcomes. Second, the relative impact of nutrition-education
policy and price policy is considered. This study uses individual-level data from the 19922006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for each state. These data are
augmented with state-specific federal nutrition-education program funding levels and food
prices over the same time period.
In addition, to my knowledge, this is the first study in any discipline to investigate the
impact of nutrition-education policy across states. Therefore, this study is an important
addition to the general investigation of the impact of price policy on weight outcomes. Extant
studies that investigate price policy have done so using state-fixed effects to control for statelevel attitudes and strategies to combat obesity. This paper improves on the previously
described strategy from the price policy literature by holding actual state-level policies and
annual expenditures to combat obesity constant in models that use state-fixed effects, yearfixed effects and state-specific time trends. The model design, described in more detail later,
provides direct estimates of policy and expenditure impacts on BMI and obesity outcomes.

This study provides new and important information about the effectiveness of state-level
policies designed to reduce obesity.

Background

2.1

BMI Growth

Table 2 documents the large increase in prevalence of overweight and obesity among
individuals 18 years of age and older between 1976 and 2004. The 19% increase in
overweight and 55% increase in obesity over the roughly 15 - year period between NHANESII
and NHANESIII generated considerable concern. Obesity prevalence continued to rise by
42% over the roughly 15 years from NHANES (1988 – 1994) to NHANES (2003 - 2004), while
over the same time-period the increase in the prevalence of overweight remained fairly
constant at about 18%.

Data from the BRFSS provide additional evidence of these trends. As can be seen in Figure
1, the average BMI for the US population increased by roughly 7% from 1995–2006. 3 The
persistence in the trend is of interest to policy makers because the increase in the average
BMI continued even after the problems associated with increasing BMI and obesity were
identified. Additionally, the rise in the average BMI continues while expenditures on weight-

BMI is not a perfect measure of overall fatness or health of an individual. However, given the current state of the literature I selected BMI,
because it is the most widely accepted measure of obesity. For further information, see Burkhauser and Cawley, 2008.

loss services and products designed to aid weight reduction, including medical procedures
and pharmaceuticals are rising (Reuters, April 21, 2009).

2.2

Associated Medical Complications and Costs
The literature on obesity has been growing rapidly since the mid-1990s. The

importance and salience of the research derives from well-documented adverse health
outcomes associated with obesity and overweight (McGinnis and Foege, 1993; Allison et al.,
1999). Obesity and overweight are currently associated with an increased risk of coronary
heart disease, type-2 diabetes, certain cancers (endometrial, breast, and colon),
hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, liver and gallbladder disease, sleep apnea and
respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, and gynecological problems (Kahn, et. al, 1997).

In 2006, the estimated medical costs associated with obesity were $147 billion (2008
dollars) (Finkelstein, et al., 2009). At the individual level, persons with a BMI in the obese
range increase their medical expenditures by $1,429 (2008 dollars) per year when compared
4

to counterparts with a healthy BMI (Finkelstein, et al. 2009). Previously, a study using data
from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and the National Health Accounts (NHA)
found that medical spending on obesity ranged from US$26.8 to US$47.5 billion dollars per
year, as described in Table 1 from Finkelstein, Fiebelkorn and Wang (2003).

Table 1 illustrates that obesity also places a significant burden on publicly-funded
programs. In 1998, approximately 42% of the obesity-related costs were publicly financed, as
described by Table 1. In fact, the public funding of overweight and obesity rivals the amount of
public funding associated with smoking (National Center for Tobacco Free Kids, 2002).

2.3

Policies to Combat Obesity
As mentioned previously, the main conclusion in the economics literature is that due to

evolving technological change has correlated with a sustained increase in calorie
consumption relative to calorie expenditure. The literature varies in identification of the causal
mechanism of this imbalance. To date, the literature has focused on the implications of price
policy as a tool to effect a change away from high-calorie, low-nutrition food (Philipson ,2001;
Lakdawalla and Philipson, 2002; Auld and Powell, 2008; Beyoun, Powell, Yuan, 2008;
5

Cawley, 1999; Cawley, Lakdawalla, and Philipson, 2002; Chou, Grossman, and Saffer, 2004;
Chou, Rashad, Grossman, 2008; Goldman, Lakdawalla, Zheng, 2009; Fletcher , Frisvold,
Tefft, 2010; Rashad, Grossman, Chou, 2006).

An understudied mechanism for change is

nutrition-education policy. Nutrition-education policy could be a successful means to reduce
individual-level BMI, particularly among higher income, more highly-educated consumers
(Chaloupka, 1991). In fact, recent economic literature has found that spending on education
programs can be a successful means to induce other healthy behaviors. For example, the
literature on anti-smoking campaigns has found that cigarette sales and anti-smoking
campaign funding are inversely related (Farrelly, et al., 2003).
Other disciplines have devoted more attention to assessing existing nutritioneducational programs relative to economics. Clinical studies have found that nutritioneducation has been effective in reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease,
diabetes and obesity (Lasker et al., 2008; Dansinger, 2005). In addition, some specialized
research has demonstrated the effectiveness of nutrition-education programs in small clinical
trials (Connelly, et al., 2007). Other studies have examined the impact of nutrition education
on college students, finding a positive effect on nutrition and weight reduction (Clifford, et al.
2009; Byrd-Williams, et al., 2009). Given the suggestive evidence from smaller studies, it
seems likely that broad-scale federal funding of state nutrition-education programs may be an
effective means to reduce the prevalence of overweight and, more specifically, obesity without
implementing tax or other pricing policies, which are regressive and strongly opposed by
corporations and interest groups.
2.3.1 Background on Federal Nutrition-Education Funding Program
Funding: Federal and Non-federal Public Nutrition Programs

6

Federally, nutrition and obesity education is delivered through the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA). The USDA relies on state-level public entities, public
schools (school systems and universities), public health clinics, etc. to extend information to
the population. The USDA funds these programs through grants and other contracts to the
states’ health departments. Many of the programs are funded by the USDA through the
Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Therefore, SNAP created the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program’s Education Program (SNAP-ed) to distribute the
federal nutrition-education funds. SNAP-ed is a dollar-per-dollar federal match to all nonfederal public funds already allocated at the state-level for the delivery of nutrition-education
programs.
The USDA started allocating funds through SNAP-ed in 1988 with a grant to
Wisconsin. By 1992, USDA distributed $661,000 across seven states (Wisconsin, Minnesota,
Ohio, New Hampshire, New York, Oklahoma, and Washington). By 2004, fifty states
participated in the program and they received a combined total of $228.2 million.
State-level Federally Funded Programs
Currently, the USDA regulation 7 CFR 272.2 gives states the option of participating in
the program by applying for the federal match. Although participation is not mandatory, it is
strongly encouraged. The main objective is to improve the likelihood that persons eligible for
SNAP will make healthy food choices and choose physically active lifestyles. The goals are
consistent with the current Dietary Guidelines for Americans for the general US population
(U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
2005).

7

Limited guidance is provided to the states regarding the structure of state nutrition
education programs. In general, states are encouraged to use “the most effective nutrition
education tools and strategies available” to develop interventions focusing on the following
key behavioral outcomes:
1.

Eat fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat milk products
daily.

2.

Be physically active every day.

3.

Balance caloric intake from food and beverages with calories expended.

Interventions range from broad social marketing campaigns, to the provision of a
comprehensive nutrition education curriculum, to an individual or group (direct intervention).
The indirect interventions involve social marketing campaigns which disseminate information
and messages in a variety of ways, from recipe cards and wristbands to flyers and television
or radio public service announcements. The variability in the delivery approach may result in
somewhat diffuse treatment effects despite a fairly uniform overall use of learner-centered
and behavioral-focused interventions. One representative state, Indiana, offered direct
education programs in the following settings: local cooperative extension offices, youth
education sites (preschools and day care), emergency food assistance sites, elderly services
site, WIC clinics, adult education and training sites and churches/other faith based
organization sites. The indirect materials used by programs in the state of Indiana included
widely disseminated print material and participation in public events. Given the focus of
Indiana’s program, 90% of the participants are adults (18 years old or older). In comparison,
Michigan, one of the first recipients of the funds, offers a well developed program that targets
both direct education and indirect education through multiple venues. The direct education
8

sites include all the direct education venues listed for Indiana plus the following additional
sites: public schools (K-12), food stores or other retail outlets and health care sites. The
indirect education includes mass communication (radio, television, newspapers, posters),
print materials and participation in public events. The demographic profile of Michigan’s
program is estimated to be 52% school aged children (5 to 17 years old) and infants (less
than 5 years old) and 48% adults (18 years old or older) (USDA, 2004). 4

3.

Analytical Framework
Any behavioral model aimed at describing BMI must include the energy balance

equation, defined as the difference between energy consumed and energy expended (Chou
et al., 2002; Chou et al., 2004; Philipson, 2001). If the energy consumed is greater than the
energy expended and the imbalance persists over time, an increase in BMI results. If
marginal increases in BMI persist, overweight could become obesity. To counteract the
growth in an individual’s BMI, the imbalance must be reversed. However, constraints may
impede an individual’s ability to reverse the energy imbalance and reduce their BMI. Some
constraints are exogenous, for example age and genetics, while others, such as knowledge
and prices may be influenced by policy.
A health production framework that incorporates the energy balance framework can be
used to model improvements in health as providing utility (Grossman, 1972). When applied
to nutrition and weight gain, an individual is assumed to gain utility from alterations to the
production process that balances energy intake and output resulting in healthy weight.
Disutility results from a BMI that is outside of the healthy (normal) range (18.5 kg/m2 ≤ BMI <
25 kg/m2). With this in mind, a BMI outside of the normal range, according to economic
4

At the time of this writing the only data available regarding the state-specific programs was from 2004.

9

theory, must result from changes to the production process or from changes in the prices of
inputs to the production process. If BMI increases over time to be consistent with utility
maximization or the household production frameworks, then BMI must be a by-product of
some other production process, such as leisure. Chou, Grossman and Saffer (2004)
conceptualize the rise in obesity as a by-product. Household production of other
commodities, such as leisure, which can include dining out with friends, may produce effects
that negatively impact weight and health. Alternatively, leisure could also be conceptualized
as an input to health production with negative or positive marginal product depending on its
effect on BMI. In either conceptualization, negative effects may be moderated by improved
information or education about the health production process and the caloric content of
inputs to it (e.g. nutrition-education).
In this paper, the production of an undesirable BMI is conceptualized as a by-product
of household production. Reductions in information asymmetries about caloric and
nutritional content through nutrition-education resulting in more efficient health production
can be viewed as managerial shifts in the household production process that reduce the byproduction of weight gain (Grossman, 1972). This mirrors other production processes where
economic research has shown that on-the-job training and on-the-job learning increases
production efficiency (Mincer, 1984; Barron, et al. 1989). Training and educational programs
with a targeted purpose, such as increased health production, should similarly reduce BMI
and the probability of an individual being overweight or obese. Within this framework, we also
test the hypothesis that BMI and weight outcomes are influenced by the stock of information
rather than the within period flow.

Data Description and Empirical Implementation
10

4.1

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)

Three individual-level outcomes are investigated: 1) actual BMI, 2) an indicator that the
individual’s BMI is above the normal range (overweight) (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2), and 3) an indicator
that an individual’s BMI-level is in the obese range (obese) (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). The individuallevel variables and all demographic variables used to describe the three weight outcomes
derive from repeated cross-sections of the BRFSS, an annual telephone survey of persons 18
years and older. Surveys are conducted by each participating state’s health department and
administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC uses
BRFSS to calculate national and state-specific estimates of the prevalence of lifestyles and
behaviors that contribute to various health outcomes, including obesity.
Fifteen states participated in the first survey in 1984. State participation rose to 49
states by 1992 and all 50 states by 1996. During this time, the respondent participation in the
BRFSS rose from 96,213 in 1992 to 355,216 in 2006. The final analysis sample for the
pooled cross-section 1992-2006 includes 2,262,952 individuals from 1992-2006. 5 As was
seen in Figure 1, the U.S. average BMI increased by 2.10 kg/m2, or approximately 7%
between 1992 and 2006.

Obesity

Figure 2 provides evidence of the growth in the prevalence of overweight and obesity within
the US as described by BRFSS. The growth in obesity is fed by those transitioning from a
BMI in the overweight range to a BMI in the obese range. Therefore, by focusing on
overweight rather than individual categories allows for a more accurate picture of the
“fattening” of the US population. Over the time-frame of study, the prevalence of overweight
in the BRFSS increased from 1992 to 2006 by nearly 35%.
Further analysis of the individual-level variables used in the empirical model reader is
found in Table 3, which presents the descriptive statistics for the variables for the 1992-2006
time frame. The variables include measures of age, gender, marital status, education-level,
employment and income-levels. The income-levels are used to create a real income variable
(in 1984 dollars) for consistency with the other variables that measure prices and funding. A
description of the state-level price and funding variables presented in Table 3 are provided in
subsequent sections.

Data on USDA Funding

State expenditures on nutrition education are measured by federal funds annually
allocated to each state’s CES office to allocate to the nutrition education program. As
previously noted, these funds represent the federal match to the public non-federal funds
allocated to the states. Because the dollar for dollar match that requires states to take the
initiative to secure the funds, it likely reflects the state’s interest and engagement in nutrition
education and is associated with endogeneity at the state-level. To the extent that unobserved
13

determinants of state interest in providing nutrition education are correlated with unobserved
individual traits that influence food choice and weight, the endogeneity represents a potential
source of bias in estimation of the effect of expenditures on weight outcomes. For this reason,
I impose identifying restrictions, which are described later, on the estimated models in order to
obtain causal estimates of the relationship between educational funds, BMI and the
probabilities of overweight and obesity.

In 1992, only 7 states were approved for a total of $661,076 in federal funding. 6 In 2000,
the number of states receiving funding increased to all states except Delaware, Maryland and
Alaska, for a total of $247,024,645. Expenditures are deflated by the CPI to reflect 1984
dollars. The nominal state-level funding is publicly available from the USDA. This data reflect
both participation and amount of funding. The trend in the average state-level real nutrition6

has increased substantially from 1992-2006.
4.3

Price Data

An additional policy variable of interest is food price. Given the analytical model with
individual weight as the outcome is, in effect, a reduced-form weight or health production
function, the model must include a measure of input prices (i.e., food prices). Models use
state-level food price indices, classified by whether food is purchased for preparation and
consumption at home (home food price) or purchased away from home and already prepared
(away food price). Price data is from the ACCRA Cost of Living Index, which is published
quarterly by the American Chamber of Commerce Research Association (ACCRA) for 250300 urban centers. The index is widely used by economists, researchers and corporations to
measure relative cost of living. Quarterly state-specific population-weighted city prices in a
given year were averaged to get annual prices.
The state-level home food price index is calculated as a population weighted average
of the nominal prices for all items included in the home food index for each urban area in a
state. The away food price is created similarly. When calculating the away food price and
home food price, only food items that are available in the ACCRA COLI consistently from
1992-2006 are included. 8 Food prices are deflated by the CPI to 1984 prices (real home food
price and real away food price). The averages for the real home food price and the real away
food price are provided in Table 3.

For simplicity, I will refer to real nutrition-education funding as simply nutrition-education funding in the text.
Therefore, items such as tomatoes are excluded from the home food price calculation.

In order to estimate the effect of food prices and nutrition-education funding on the weight
outcomes, we closely follow the methodologies that estimate the effect of other prices, as well
as educational campaigns funding on outcomes. Tobacco consumption and its response to
changes in price and anti-smoking campaign funding has been modeled in the past.
Examples include Chaloupka and Warner (2000), which provides an extensive review of the
cigarette price and tax literature, and Farrelly et al. (2002), which examines the anti-smoking
campaign literature.
Linear probability models are used to estimate the effects of nutrition education funding
on two individual-level binary indicator variables: overweight and obese. For the continuous
outcome, BMI, a linear model is used. As a baseline, the following estimating equation is
offered,
(1) Y ist =β 0 + β 1 X ist + β 2 (Real Nutrition Education Funding) st + β 3 (Real Away Food Price) st +
β 4 (Real Home Food Price) st + β 5 State+β 6 Year+ε ist
Where i indexes the individual, s indexes the state, and t indexes the year. Y ist is one of two
individual-level indicators for the binary outcomes of having a BMI in the overweight or obese
range. For the continuous model, Y ist is the individual-level BMI (BMI). X ist is a vector of
individual demographic characteristics, including dummies for male, white, black, Hispanic,
high-school graduate, some college or more, age and age squared, and a continuous variable
for real income. Real Away Food Price and Real Home Food Price are the state and year
specific real price indices for Food Away Price and Food Home Price. State is a vector of
state dummies, and Year is a vector of year dummies. Again, β 2 , β 3, and β 4 are the
coefficients of interest. Identification of the parameters of interest in equation (1) is achieved

16

by within state variation in funding over time relative to state that does not experience
changes in funding over time.
This identification strategy fails to control for state-specific unobserved characteristics
that may vary over time and impact weight outcomes, nutrition-education funding levels and
prices. To address this limitation, Gruber and Frakes (2006) suggest improving equation (1)
by adding controls for state-specific linear time trends.
(2)Y ist =β 0 + β 1 X ist + β 2 (Real Nutrition Education Funding) st + β 3 (Real Away Food Price) st +
β 4 (Real Home Food Price) st + β 5 State + β 6 Year + β 7 State x Time + ε ist .
A model described by equation (2) is more accurate if nutrition-education expenditures
are endogenous. A model with fixed state effects and year effects will not capture all potential
state-level causal responses to nutrition education. For instance, as states change funding
levels in response to local economic conditions, BMI within the state could also change.
Equation (2) includes state-specific linear time trends to ensure only the estimated real
spending on nutrition-education and price effect reflects exogenous policy changes rather
than a combination of the effects of spending, price policy changes and some unmeasured
state characteristics, (e.g. trends in nutrition awareness or social norms within a state that
differ across states and over time). This identification strategy uses the variation in
implementation of nutrition-education programs across the country to control for unobservable
factors for changes in these influences over time.
To address any unobserved social norms regarding physical health impact funding,
prices and weight outcomes, I estimate a specification that includes a 1 year lagged value of
the state average BMI. Finally, as a falsification test, I estimate the impact of nutritioneducation funding on the probability that the individual wears a bicycle helmet.

17

The data definitions, means, and standard deviations of all individual-level and statelevel variables were discussed previously in the data section and reported in Table 3. The
statistics are based on a sample of 2,252,664 individuals. Finally, in all regressions the
BRFSS survey weights and the standard errors are corrected for heteroskedasticity and
clustering within states.
5. Results and Discussion
All results presented in this section are generated from the regressions described in
equations (1) and (2) above. Results describe the influence of both the real nutritioneducation program funding and real food prices on BMI, as well as probabilities of overweight
and obesity. Because these models are linear probability models, the presented regression
coefficients are marginal effects and the standard errors are corrected for heteroskedasticity
and clustering at the state-level.
Table 4 provides a baseline assessment of federal nutrition spending and price effect
from estimation of equation (1). In addition, Table 4 includes the results of equation (1)
omitting the real food prices. Results in Table 4 suggest that inclusion of real food prices has
very little effect on the size of the marginal effect of nutrition education spending. In addition,
the results suggest that nutrition-education spending (on average) has the intended marginal
effect on individual level BMI, but not on probability of overweight or obesity. The size of the
effect is quite small, however, implying that a $1 million increase in expenditures will
decrease individual BMI by 0.0017 kg/m2. For the average 45 year old male, at a height of 5
feet, 9 inches (1.75 meters) and weight of 180 lbs (81.81 kg), this would be a 0.01915 lb
(0.008686 kg) loss. This model does not control for state-specific linear time trends.

18

Therefore, the results may be biased by unobserved state- and individual-level traits that
vary over time.

Table 5 presents the results of specification (2), the estimating equation that adds a
state-specific time trend. As shown, the estimated relationship between real nutritioneducation funding and all individual-level outcomes is positive. Interestingly, the effect of
price policy is larger in magnitude than the estimated expenditure effects and is statistically
significant for BMI.

The positive relation between real spending on nutrition-education programs and the
weight outcomes as described in Table 5 is troubling and suggests that models controlling for
19

unobservable changes in the state-specific trends in attitudes about nutrition or trends in
combating obesity may still may be imprecisely estimating the average impact of real funding
for nutrition-education programs and/or price policy. For instance, the results in Table 5
suggest that reverse causality may be a source of bias. Perhaps, states with higher BMI are
allocated more federal funding or are more aggressive in obtaining funding to combat obesity.
If true, then state-specific time trends cannot control for such influence. Given a potential
reverse causality problem and the dynamics of weight, using a lagged measure of statespecific real nutrition education funding and prices may be more appropriate when estimating
the impact on individual-level measure of BMI, obesity and overweight.
Table 6 illustrates the effect of real nutrition-education funding and real food prices
when one and two period lags are used for real funding for nutrition-education programs, real
home food price and real away food price. In these models, an interesting change is
illustrated. While controlling for both state-specific linear and quadratic time trends, neither a
one nor two-period measure of lagged funding shows a significant impact on BMI, obesity or
overweight. However, in the two-period model, the impact of the real price of food purchased
for home consumption has a negative and significant effect on all individual-level outcome
measures. This suggests real nutrition-education program funding may be less effective than
targeted price policy. Over at least a two period lag, the results suggest increasing food
prices may reduce individual food demand to a level consistent with weight stabilization rather
than weight gain.

a= p < 0.01. Additional variables included are age, age squared, gender, education level, real income, martial and employment status.

Another possibility that derives from the lagged nature of intake and weight change is
that the stock of information about nutrition and calorie balance is more important than the
period-specific flow of information. Table 7 demonstrates the cumulative impact of real
nutrition education funding. As demonstrated, the impact across all three weight outcome
measures is negative. There is a statistically significant and negative impact of cumulative
real nutrition-education funding on BMI. While the impact on obese and overweight is
negative, neither coefficient is statistically significant. This result suggests, the stock of statelevel investment in real nutrition-education information has more power than the annual
investment.

Finally, real education funding and price policies could possibly have differential effects
21

based on income and education level. The effects illustrated in Table 5 are estimates of the
average effect for all income groups. Therefore, Table 8 considers the interactive effect of
real nutrition education policy and price policy by income level. To create the interaction
terms, the following income categories provided by the BRFSS were used: less than
$25,000/year; between $25,000 and $50,000/year; and over $50,000/year. The three
categories were interacted with real nutrition-education funding and the real food price
indices. Results indicate that the impact of real nutrition-education funding and price policy
varies by level of real income.
From Table 8, the interaction effects allow us to identify the appropriate effect of real
nutrition-education funding for the highest income groups. In fact, only the BMI and
prevalence of obesity among the middle income group is significantly impacted by the level of
real nutrition-education funding. Table 8 also describes the differential effects of real food
prices by income group for the weight outcomes. The real food away price has the intended
and significant effect on the lowest income group. In comparison, the weight outcomes for the
highest income groups are positively, but insignificantly, influenced by increases in the real
price of food purchased for away from home consumption (real away food price). The real
price of food purchased for at-home consumption (real home food price), has an interesting
impact on one weight outcome: obese. For the highest income group, the real home food
price has a negative and significant impact on the probability of being obese.

a= p < 0.01. Additional variables included are age, age squared, gender, education level, real income, martial and employment status.

Another useful analysis is determining the impact of nutrition education funding by
education level. Table 9 considers the interactive effect of real nutrition education policy and
price policy by education level. To create the interaction terms, the BRFSS used the following
categories: less than a high-school education (less than high school); only a high school
degree (high school); and some college or more (some college). The three categories were
interacted with real nutrition-education funding and the real food price indices. The results are
qualitatively the same as the income effect. As expected, the effect of nutrition-education
funding has a larger impact on the higher educated group. Additionally, the same qualitative
effects result for the interaction of education level and real food prices as estimated for the
interaction of income level and real food prices. Thus, describing the same differential effects
of price policy and education policy. These results suggest the lowest income and education
levels price policies, although regressive, have a larger and more significant impact on weight
outcomes relative to funding nutrition education programs.

Conclusion
The estimates contained in the previously reported tables suggest the nutrition-education

funding is having less success than intended. As reported above, cumulative and lagged
effects of real nutrition-education funding show some evidence of a larger impact on some
measures of weight than the impact of contemporaneous funding. In addition, individuals
from some income groups and education levels are more responsive to price and real
nutrition-education funding than others, although the significant effects are quite small.
These results are consistent with previous work that suggests lower income, less welleducated individuals are more responsive to price whereas higher income, better educated
individuals will be more responsive to information. For lower income groups, regressive real
price increases for food prepared away from home has the intended but perhaps not the
24

desired regressive impacts. Also, for individuals with incomes in the range of $25,000 to
$50,000 / per year, BMI and probability of being obese appear to respond to changes in real
nutrition-education funding.
An important note is the estimated impacts of all of the evaluated policies were small. In
addition, some evidence suggests that education policy is less effective relative to price
policy. This research takes advantage of already existing data to provide a useful analysis.
Further research could offer an investigation of the mechanisms by which states obtain and
implement nutrition education programs, as well as if different types of programs produce
better results than others. This line of research will continue as these data become available.
