    "abstract": "\n\nHow do the different elements in the standard bundle of property rights \u2013 such as the right of possession or the right of transfer \u2013 differentially impact outcomes, such as urban development? This paper incorporates insecure property rights into a standard model of urban land prices and density, and makes predictions about investment in land and property, informality, and the efficiency of land use. Our empirical analysis links data on institutions related to land titling and transfer with multiple urban outcomes, from 190 countries. The evidence is generally consistent with the model\u2019s predictions, and more broadly with the Demsetz\u2019s (1967) approach to property rights institutions. Indeed, we document world-wide improvements in the quality of institutions facilitating property transfer over time.\n\n",
