ABSTRACT
The General Educational Development (GED) credential is issued on the basis of an eight hour subject-based
test. The test claims to establish equivalence between dropouts and traditional high school graduates,
opening the door to college and positions in the labor market. In 2008 alone, almost 500,000 dropouts
passed the test, amounting to 12% of all high school credentials issued in that year. This chapter reviews
the academic literature on the GED, which finds minimal value of the certificate in terms of labor
market outcomes and that only a few individuals successfully use it as a path to obtain post-secondary
credentials. Although the GED establishes cognitive equivalence on one measure of scholastic aptitude,
recipients still face limited opportunity due to deficits in noncognitive skills such as persistence, motivation
and reliability. The literature finds that the GED testing program distorts social statistics on high school
completion rates, minority graduation gaps, and sources of wage growth. Recent work demonstrates
that, through its availability and low cost, the GED also induces some students to drop out of school.
The GED program is unique to the United States and Canada, but provides policy insight relevant
to any nation's educational context.

1 Introduction
1

The General Educational Development (GED) program has become a major factor in American education.

Dropouts from high school can take a seven hour battery of tests to obtain a GED credential. GEDs are widely
held to be equivalent to individuals who receive a traditional high school diploma by taking courses and acquiring
credit hours. Indeed, capturing this sentiment, many erroneously term the GED certicate as a General Equivalency Degree.

The GED program is quantitatively signicant.

Figure 1 shows that currently 12% of all high

2 and that there has been substantial growth overtime in the number of GED

school credentials issued are GEDs,
certicates issued.

This chapter reviews a body of literature, starting with Cameron and Heckman [1993], that shows that GEDs are
not equivalent to ordinary high school graduates.

GEDs have higher achievement test scores than dropouts in

part because they complete more years of high school. Controlling for their greater scholastic ability, GEDs are
equivalent to uncredentialed dropouts in terms of their labor market outcomes and their general performance in
society. On average, obtaining a GED does not increase the wages of dropouts. While GEDs go to college at higher
rates than dropouts, few nish more than one semester. The same traits that lead them to drop out of school also

3

lead them to leave from jobs early, to divorce more frequently, and to fail in the military.

Given the preponderance of evidence against benecial eects of GED certication for the average GED recipient,
it is surprising that the GED program has grown so dramatically in the past 50 years. We examine explanations
for its growth. A primary cause is the growth of government programs that promote the GED as a quick x for
addressing the high school dropout problem. Adult Education programs and programs designed to promote convict
rehabilitation are major contributors, the latter being especially important for African-American males. We present
evidence that high schools are increasingly promoting the use of the GED.

None of this would matter if the GED were harmless, like wearing a broken watch and knowing that it is broken. But
the GED is not harmless. Treating it as equivalent to a high school degree distorts social statistics and gives false
signals that America is making progress when it is not. A substantial part of the measured convergence of black and
white high school attainment is fueled by prison-issued GEDs. Counting GEDs as dropouts, the African-American

limitations of using achievement exams to certify preparedness for schools and the workplace.

issued that year.

male high school graduation rate in 2000 is at the same level as it was in 1960.

Improperly counting GEDs as

high school graduates also overestimates the returns to college. We document how American social statistics are
distorted by assuming that GEDs are equivalent to ordinary high school graduates. We also show how the GED
creates problems. It induces students to drop out of school and lose the benets of a high school degree.

There are larger lessons from a study of the GED program. GEDs are as smart as ordinary high school graduates,
as measured by a scholastic achievement test. Yet, as a group, GEDs fail to perform at the level of high school
graduates. We show that noncognitive decits  such as lack of persistence, low self-esteem, low self-ecacy, and
high propensity for risky behavior  explain the lack of success for many GEDs. Decits of what are sometimes
called soft skills are often not taken into account in public policy discussions involving economic opportunity. A
study of the GED shows the inuence of personality traits on success in life and the need for public policies that
address both cognitive and personality decits.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a short introduction to the GED, its structure, and a brief
history. Section 3 looks at dierences among dropouts, GEDs, and high school graduates, and discusses the evidence
on labor market performance and educational attainment of GEDs. Section 4 presents evidence on the sources of
growth of the GED program, and the changes over time in demographic groups it serves. Section 5 reviews the

5

adverse consequences of the GED. Section 6 concludes.

2 Institutional Background and Functions of the GED
There are substantial consequences of being a high school dropout.

Wage premia for education have increased

over the last three decades. Using Census PUMs data, Goldin and Katz [2008] report that the wage dierential
between high school graduates and dropouts grew from 16.7% in 1970, to 21% in 1990, to 25.5% in 2000. Figure 2,
reproduced from Autor, Katz, and Kearney [2008], shows that real wages by educational level have diverged across
time for both males and females. At the same time that real wages for those with college are steadily increasing,
real wages for male dropouts are currently below their 1963 levels, and real wages for female dropouts are eectively
unchanged since 1970.

4 The rate of

Figure 3 shows that across cohorts, college attendance and college completion have both increased.

college attendance conditional on nishing high school, and the rate of college graduation conditional on attendance
have both trended upward. The outlier is the high school graduation rate, which has trended downward starting
with the 1950 birth cohort.

The growth in people seeking alternative certication through the GED is a major

contributor to this trend. Figure 4 shows that dropout rates since 1970 have decreased if GEDs are counted as high
school graduates, but have increased if they are counted as dropouts.

2.1 The GED Test
The GED was introduced by the American Council on Education (ACE) in 1942 as a credential for returning World

5 The test was originally used as

a tool for placing returning veterans in college and high school. It was quickly expanded as a method for earning
high school diplomas or equivalency credentials.
States began to oer the test to civilians in the late 1940s and, by 1959, civilian GED test takers outnumbered
veteran GED recipients [GED Testing Service 1958-2008, Quinn 2002]. Relative to its very targeted beginning, the
GED program has expanded to serve dropouts across a wide population. The GED currently targets a large and

6

diverse population, including many who are unqualied to join the military [Laurence, forthcoming].

The GED Test:

The GED exam has been a battery of ve tests since its introduction. Its content has been

updated three times with the introduction of new series designed to keep the test relevant to job skills and
educational requirements [GED Testing Service, 2009]. The current version of the GED test takes just over seven
hours to complete and focuses on interpretation and analysis of information rather than on factual recall.

The

reading section has changed from being a general reading comprehension test to a test of reading real life work
materials or newspaper articles.

The math content demands more analysis and synthesis than factual recall.

Examples of an easy and hard math problem are shown in Figure 5. The GED test introduced a short essay or
writing sample starting in 1988, and the use of a calculator for part of the math subsection was introduced on the
2002 test series [GED Testing Service, 1958-2008].

It was initially decided that the pass score should be set so that 80% of graduation-bound high school seniors could
pass [Boesel et al. 1998, Quinn 2002].

An analysis of the 1943 norming study suggests that the 80% pass rate

overstates the actual diculty of the original test [Quinn, 2002]. Quinn [2002] also highlights that the original test
included a high probability of passing due to chance.

After three increases in the diculty of the test, only 60% of current graduation-bound high school seniors are now
estimated to be able to pass the entire test on their rst try [GED Testing Service, 2009].

Key changes to the GED test are displayed in Table 1, which also documents the expansion of the test. In 1947,
New York was the rst state to oer the test to civilian dropouts [Quinn, 2002]. In 1974, California was the last
state to oer a recognized GED certicate for passing the GED test. The table covers the three changes in test series
as well as the three changes in test diculty. For more details on the GED's history, content, standards, norming,
and scoring procedures see Section A of the Web Appendix (http://jenni.uchicago.edu/GEDHandbookChapter/).

GED Preparation and Means of Benet:

The data on preparation times suggest that study for the GED is

likely to lead to little or no human capital formation. In 1980, the median test-taker had studied for 20 hours and,

7 However, a sizable

in 1989, had invested 30 hours of preparation [Quinn 2002, GED Testing Service 1958-2008].

number of individuals study more than 100 hours, growing from 11.8% to 24.2% of takers in that same period. This
indicates that certain populations may benet somewhat from their preparation for the GED. To put this statistic
into perspective, an average high school student spends approximately 1,080 hours in class a year [Carroll, 1990].
changes in the demographic groups served by the GED have led to dierences in composition away from the motivated, disciplined
group of individuals to whom it was initially targeted.

7 This

amount applies only to test takers not qualifying as exceptions to the minimum age requirement.

More recently, Zhang et al. [2009] nd that, in 2006, the median study time for those who reported studying for
the GED was 25 hours.

At the same time, the availability of the GED may induce a decrease in the eort spent on schooling.

The

academic literature often compares outcomes for GEDs to those for dropouts. However, for many individuals, the
relevant counterfactual comparison is between the GED and high school graduation. As passing the GED requires
substantially less eort than completing high school, its availability induces many students who would otherwise
complete school to leave [Heckman et al. 2008, Humphries 2010]. This evidence is corroborated by a 2002 survey
by the National Center for Education Statistics [2006] which found that 40.5% of surveyed high school dropouts
listed would be easier to get the GED as among their reasons for leaving school. Behind Missed too many school
days, this was the second most frequently cited reason for leaving.

With the possible exception of individuals in the right-hand tail of the preparation time distribution, it seems unlikely
that GED test takers are producing valuable human capital that will directly increase their wages. However, as a
widely-recognized credential that tests for certain types of ability, it may serve as a signal to employers, the military,

8 A

and post-secondary institutions that the individual is more capable than the average uncredentialed dropout.

key caveat to the signaling argument is that the signaling value of a GED will reect all associations due to sorting,
such as through disproportionate receipt by the incarcerated or unmotivated takers who are able to complete high
school but choose not to. The quality of the signal has changed over time due to shifts in the attributes of the
GED-certied population.

GED Acceptance:

The extent to which employers and colleges treat the GED as equivalent to a high school

diploma is uncertain. A poll reported by the Society for Human Resource Management [2002] nds that 96% of
U.S. employers and training programs respond armatively to the question Does your company accept applications
with a GED credential for jobs requiring a high school degree? [GED Testing Service, 2009]. A positive response
suggests that a GED is an acceptable prerequisite for consideration, but does not indicate what relative weight
employers give to the GED.

The GED's wide acceptance as a valid prerequisite for admission to post-secondary institutions suggests that the
GED might facilitate human capital development. A poll by the The College Board [2007] nds that 98% of colleges
respond positively to the prompt that High school diploma is required and GED is accepted. Again, it is unclear

8 Spence

[1973] is the classic reference on signaling.

12

if GEDs get equal consideration for admission relative to high school graduates.

3 The Eects of GED Certication
Section 3.1 reviews the literature on the value of the GED credential in labor markets. Section 3.2 focuses on the
question of whether, and for whom, the GED leads to enrollment and completion of post-secondary education.

3.1 The Direct Benet of GED Certication
This section demonstrates that pre-existing dierences in traits causally unrelated to the eect of the GED are
responsible for the dierent labor market outcomes experienced by dropouts and GEDs. The early literature on
the topic found that GED certication has little or no eect on labor market outcomes for the average test taker.
Subsequent work has attempted to identify dierent populations and margins for which it might hold more value.

worked for terminal GEDs and terminal high school graduates over uncredentialed dropouts.

There is a clear

ordering among dropouts, GEDs, and traditional high school graduates in each measure. These dierences persist
across the life cycle, with the wage and hours premia for higher credentials increasing from their late 20s to their
late 30s.

Background Dierences Among Dropouts, GEDs, and High School Graduates:

The dierences in

labor market outcomes among these three groups can be largely explained by pre-existing characteristics that may
generate economic returns, creating a non-causal association among education levels and wages. Tables 2 and 3
show comparisons of early life characteristics by nal level of education for white males in the NLSY79 and in the

These tables show a clear ordering across nal levels of educationnotably highest grade completed, magazine

do not continue to college) generally fall between dropouts and terminal high school graduates. There are some

was administered, the surveyed individuals were of dierent ages and had acquired dierent levels of schooling.
These dierences aect their measured performance. In order to make comparisons of academic ability, we adjust
individual scores to account for the level of schooling at the time of the test. This adjustment controls for nal
educational attainment using a structural model as laid out in Hansen et al. [2004] and implemented in Heckman,
Urzua, and Veramendi [2010]. This allows comparisons of latent cognitive ability between dropouts, GED recipients,
and high school graduates prior to schooling decisions.

The comparisons in Figure 7 show that, before entry into high school, individuals who eventually GED certify
have higher cognitive ability than dropouts, and are very similar to terminal high school graduates. The cognitive
ability distribution for GEDs is nearly identical to that of high school graduates and is strongly right shifted from
uncredentialed dropouts for both males and females.

Accounting for Cognitive Ability:

Cameron and Heckman [1993] nd that the GED provides on average no

benet to male test takers after controlling for either years of completed schooling or AFQT scores. While their
study follows the NLSY79 sample through age 28, subsequent analysis replicates this nding through later ages.
Heckman and LaFontaine [2006] use later waves of the NLSY79 and nd that the GED has no benet on average log
hourly wages after controlling for AFQT. They nd that high school graduation is still associated with a positive
wage premium.

Once Heckman and LaFontaine correct for selection and control for AFQT scores, male GEDs

earn on average 1% less per hour than dropouts while terminal high school graduates make 3.6% more per hour on
average than dropouts. Similarly they nd that female GEDs earn 1.7% more per hour than dropouts while high
school graduates with no college earn 10.6% more per hour. They also show that the GED has little or no benet
after controlling for reported test scores using the National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS) data.

Figure 8 shows that, relative to the dierences shown in Figure 6, the economic benets associated with the GED are

including estimated post-high school AFQT scores, the benet of the GED is further reduced for all three economic
outcomes. For terminal high school graduates, however, economic benets persist after controlling for pre-existing
cognitive ability.

This suggests a causal eect of high school graduation.

That high school still has value after

controlling for pre-existing cognitive ability suggests high school graduates possess a valued trait not captured by
an achievement test. Section 3.1.3 extends this discussion to encompass both cognitive and noncognitive ability.
The next section follows the development of the literature in trying to identify specic populations that benet
from the GED.

3.1.2 Heterogeneous Labor Market Returns
Recent work on the GED has sought to identify groups of test takers for which individual traits or circumstances
contribute to a stronger signal or increased human capital development. This section focuses on several dierent
potential margins of benet, discusses hypotheses and reviews the related literature.

Wage Growth for GEDs with Experience:

It is argued that, similar to the pattern of returns to college, the

benets to a GED would increase with time in the labor market. Clark and Jaeger [2006] present evidence from the
Current Population Survey (CPS) that is apparently consistent with the hypothesis that the wage premium to GED
certication for males is increasing with age. Given the cross-sectional nature of the CPS data, this nding may
be attributed to either experience eects or cohort eects. Using white males and females in the NLSY79 sample,
Heckman and LaFontaine [2006] show that this higher premium to older cohorts is explained by their greater ability.
When not controlling for ability, the NLSY79 sample shows a wage premium for GED recipients that is comparable
to that found in samples of individuals from the CPS data for the same birth cohorts. Once one controls for AFQT
scores for the NLSY79 sample, there is no statistically signicant eect of certication on wages.

Using longitudinal data on earnings in the NLSY79, Murnane et al. [1995] argue that the value of the GED increases
with experience as recipients use the degree's signal for promotion, better job placement in the future, and on-theschooling attained over the seventh grade level using the procedure of Hansen et al. (2004) as implemented in Carneiro, Heckman, and

of the procedure is that the unobservables generating T (st , sF ) are mean independent of St given SF = sF . For each SF = sF , we can

Post schooling mean test scores are obtained in a similar fashion, but now adjusting to years of nal schooling. See Section D

have not yet been incarcerated. Regressions for hourly wage and hours worked are restricted to those reporting
more than $1/hour and less than $100/hour, and individuals working less than 4,000 hours in a given year. Wage
income regressions are restricted to individuals reporting wage incomes between $1,000/year and $100,000/year.

wage levels at age 28, but they report a statistically signicant 2.4% wage increase for every year of experience after
receiving a GED. Murnane, Willett, and Boudett [1999] control for cognitive ability or individual xed eects in
dierent models specications. They nd that the complementarity of GED and years of experience is statistically
signicant only for individuals with low ability.

Murnane, Willett and Boudett pool person-year observations in their regressions. They infer increasing returns to
the GED from variables interacting GED receipt with years of experience. In contrast to this approach, Heckman
and LaFontaine [2006] estimate separate regressions for earnings at dierent ages, allowing separate estimates of
returns to ability and experience by age. They nd that there is no statistically signicant eect to GED certication
at any age for both white males and white females.

Males vs. Females:

Males and females might derive dierent value from the GED through having dierent

motivations for dropping out of school. Using data from the NLSY79 Market Experience survey, Rumberger [1983]

16 Males were 65% more likely

than females to report school related issues, indicating dislike of school, being expelled, and poor performance as
their primary reason for leaving school. Among other explanations, males were more likely to leave school due to
economic reasons while a third of all women left due to pregnancy or marriage. If there are gender dierences in
later-life motivations to work and seek higher education, there could be dierential value of the GED for men and
women.

Cao, Stromsdorfer, and Weeks [1996] test for the GED's direct eect on economic outcomes for women using data
from the NLSY79 and from Washington State. Given their focus on women who may have custody of children and
be eligible for public transfer programs, they attempt to eliminate selection bias related to both the decision to
participate in the labor force and to not enroll in welfare. They nd no statistically signicant dierences between
the labor supplies of women of dierent education levels. The positive association of GED certication with hourly
wage is eliminated by controlling for the number of years of schooling completed at the time people drop out.

Table 4 presents a comparison of qualitative ndings for males and females from selected papers in the literature
and information on which data sets and cohorts are studied. In addition, both Murnane et al. [2000] and Tyler et al.
[2003] use the High School and Beyond (HSB) data set and nd, respectively, positive eects of GED certication

identify the sources of selection of each gender into drop out statusor selection into educational status and work
in generalit is dicult to interpret these ndings.

Using evidence from the NLSY79, CPS, and NALS, Heckman and LaFontaine [2006] establish that both male and
female GEDs have higher wages than dropouts and that, for both genders, the explanation is sorting by ability and
not a causal eect of the GED. They consistently nd a small but statistically signicant benet for females of 1-2%
on hourly wage which is not present or slightly negative for males. This nding is consistent with the hypothesis
that females are more likely to drop out of high school for reasons unrelated to intrinsic labor market motivation,
for example, due to pregnancy. Similarly, they nd much larger benets from high school graduation for females
than for males.

immigrants,

argue that the GED might provide a signal of ability that is more familiar to employers than educational credentials
earned outside the country, or may signal language ability and cultural assimilation. Clark and Jaeger use earnings
data in the CPS and nd that only foreign-born GEDs with no domestic credentials have a statistically signicantly
higher wage than native-born dropouts.

Heckman and LaFontaine [2006] examine the Clark and Jaeger [2006] analysis and nd that their results are
produced by data artifacts and limitations.

the CPS imputes values of missing wages for GEDs by sampling earnings of high school graduates, a process that
contaminates comparisons of the outcome dierences between those two groups and dropouts. A second source of
bias is the reliance on cross-sectional variation of wages. By making longitudinal comparisons with the CPS data,
Heckman and LaFontaine [2006] nd that receipt of a GED has no eect on earnings and explain Clark and Jaeger's
ndings as due to sorting along characteristics unmeasured in the CPS. Heckman and LaFontaine also analyze the
NALS which also identies the foreign born. They demonstrate no earnings premium to GED receipt for any group
once selection and cognitive ability are controlled for. Table 5 shows a comparison of qualitative ndings for nativeand foreign-born individuals from selected papers in the literature and information on which data sets and cohorts
are studied.

Signaling:

Tyler et al. [2000] use a dierence-in-dierences approach to examine the returns to the GED for

individuals at the cusp of passing the test.

Using variation in test score thresholds across states, they contend

that focusing on individuals who would pass the GED under one regime but not under the other will identify
the signaling eect of the GED for people at that margin. Using data from the GED Testing Service and Social
Security Administration, they separate individuals into groups by performance on the GED exam and state of
residence. Variation in the passing standards enforced by dierent states arguably creates a natural experiment
where individuals with the same score do or do not pass the GED based on their state of residence. To understand
their paper we use the notation in Table 6. Let - over a variable denote its mean.
The dierence-in-dierences estimator (DID) used by Tyler et al. [2000] is:

DID = (ȲLS,LP − ȲLS,HP ) − (ȲHS,LP − ȲHS,HP ) .

In the notation of Table 6,

ȲA,B

represents the mean wage of individuals with score

is either low passing standard (LP ) or high

passing standards, none of the individuals studied are high scoring in an absolute sense.

The rst term in equation (1) takes the dierence in average earnings between individuals who have the same ability
but dierent credential status. The second term is used to adjust for the possibility that wages in the two states
in the rst dierence are unequal. The second dierence is an estimate of the baseline wage dierence across those

19

states for individuals with the GED credential at the same low ability margin (in absolute terms).

20 They argue

Tyler et al. [2000] report a 10-19% earnings benet to GED certication at the margin for whites.

that these estimates are consistent with earlier studies whose ndings of no eect of certication only apply to the
average test taker. They claim that for the particular margin they investigatethat of low-skilled takersthere are
high signaling benets to certication that are absent for the general population of test takers.

To defend the assumption of exogeneity of state passing standards with respect to individual earnings, they perform
robustness checks considering selective mobility, dierential access to post-secondary training, dierences in state
labor markets, selective taking of the GED, and selective eort in studying across states. Rubinstein [2003] discusses
their paper, claiming that the endogeneity of studying eort would lead to upwardly-biased estimates. His model
predicts that, at the margin, low-ability individuals will exert more eort than high-ability individuals when passing

et al. [2000] implement this estimation in a linear regression to pool all states together and control for mean gender dierences

20 They

suggest that their lack of a signicant nding for non-whites may be due to an institutional eect where both disproportionate

representation of minorities in prison and the growth of GED programs for the incarcerated lead to negative associations with the test,
thus decreasing its signaling value. See Section 4 below for evidence of these demographic trends in prison-based GED receipt. The
separate estimation of the GED eect by race is rare in the literature, which typically includes regression controls for race but does not
treat it as a separate conditioning variable. See Section E.1 of the Web Appendix (http://jenni.uchicago.edu/GEDHandbookChapter/)
for a full account of study samples, treatment of race, and separate estimates by race.

assumes that these studying eorts represent cramming, and do not represent durable investments in human capital.

leads to upward bias in the DID estimate. He presents no direct empirical evidence on this bias. It is also possible
that the higher passing standard discourages low ability persons from taking the test so that his conclusion is
reversed.

GED policy in Missouri permits individuals to pass the GED if their maximum scores on individual tests across

administration of the test in its rst panel, and the distribution of maximum scores across all administrations of
the GED exam that each individual opted to take in its second panel, where a clear discontinuity arises at the
passing standard of 2,250. This behavior introduces several possible sources of bias in the comparisons between
GED certiers and dropouts. Selective retaking will lead to low ability individuals being improperly counted in
higher score groups.

If changes in scores across retakes are due to unproductive cramming (as conjectured by

Rubinstein, 2003) coupled with luck, this misclassication will lead to over-representation of low ability persons
among GEDs producing a downward bias in comparisons of successful GED test takers with those who fail. On
the other hand, if the choice to retake the test is associated with a trait of persistence that is productive in the
workplace, these persons who become GEDs have high noncognitive skills that will moderate the downward bias
due to their low ability. Jepsen et al. [2010] use Missouri administrative data on rst test scores and nal GED

Dropouts with Low Initial Endowments:

Population

Method/Identification

Tyler et al. [2000] focus on a low ability margin, and argue that low

ability GEDs command higher wages relative to dropouts of comparable ability than high ability GEDs command
relative to their non-GED counterparts. Murnane et al. [1999], Murnane et al. [2000], and Tyler et al. [2003] suggest
a human capital explanation for large eects at a low ability margin where, in order to meet a uniform passing
bar, GED recipients with the lowest academic ability when leaving school must have made the largest human
capital investments in order to pass. That is, individuals with low initial ability may disproportionately comprise
the sizable right tail in the distribution of preparation hours discussed in Section 2.1, and may thus generate a
nontrivial amount of human capital. While no data sets combine information on GED preparation times, schooling
at the time of dropping out, cognitive ability, and wages, the ndings of these three papers are consistent with the
hypothesis that low ability GEDs study more. As previously noted, the low ability GEDs who try repeatedly to
pass and do so may have higher noncognitive traits than their low ability non-GED counterparts and this might
explain their ndings. The samples and qualitative ndings of each paper are summarized in Table 7.

All of these papers nd positive returns to the GED associated with low levels of academic ability.

Murnane

et al. [1999] control for individual heterogeneity using a long panel of earnings data from the NLSY79 sample to
control for individual xed eects. The wage returns are limited, with Murnane et al. [1999]'s analysis suggesting
a statistically signicant 6% hourly wage premium ve years after GED certication. It would be instructive to
compare the noncognitive skills of the low ability GEDs with those of dropouts who do not certify. To the best of
our knowledge, this has not been done.

Murnane et al. [2000] use the High School and Beyond (HSB) data to examine growth in scores on subject tests

27

that are administered with the initial wave when participants are in 10th grade, and tests that are administered
in the next wave that is sampled two years later. Controlling for completion of 10th and 11th grade and baseline
test scores, GEDs make larger test score gains than do dropouts. They note that while this nding may be due to
dierential returns to education or other unobserved heterogeneity, this pattern is consistent with the hypothesis
that studying for the GED examination did increase the math skills of dropouts.

3.1.3 Cognitive and Noncognitive Ability
Just as cognitive ability is commonly a confounding factor in explaining the labor market returns to education,
Heckman and Rubinstein [2001] demonstrate that dropping out is associated with negative social traits such as
criminal behavior, divorce, risky social behaviors, and job turnover that are not controlled for in statistical studies.
As a test of cognitive ability, the GED does not directly measure these negative social traits or induce sorting along
the lines of positive traits.

Heckman and Rubinstein introduce the idea that this association of the GED with

negative social traits makes it a mixed signal.

While Section 3.1.1 demonstrates that GEDs lie between dropouts and high school graduates in academic outcomes
and home background, Figures 10 and 11 show that GEDs are similar to, or worse than, dropouts in terms of social

distributions of noncognitive ability while high school graduates are substantially right shifted.

cognitive and noncognitive measures (which are standardized to mean zero, standard deviation 1) on log hourly

and sex, noncognitive skills are of equal or greater importance at many educational levels as measured in eects on
outcomes of unit changes in standard deviations.

Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua [2006] and Heckman, Urzua, and Veramendi [2010] study the eect of education
and noncognitive skills on earnings and other outcomes. Both papers use factor models to generate estimates of
cognitive and noncognitive ability from multiple measures of those traits, and both choices of education levels and
earnings outcomes as functions of those skills. Both papers use a generalized Roy model to control for selection
into schooling and to estimate labor market returns to educational attainment that vary by levels of cognitive and
noncognitive skill. While both papers measure cognitive ability from AFQT scores, Heckman et al. [2006] measure
noncognitive factors using Rosenberg and Rotter scales in conjunction with educational choices. Heckman et al.
[2010] construct noncognitive factors from measures of teenage behavior, specically participation in minor and
major illegal activity, smoking, drinking, drug use, involvement in after-school clubs, and sexual intercourse by the
age of 15.

Notes: The top panel represents the log wage eect of GED

receipt by joint distribution of cognitive and noncognitive ability. The lower panels show the log wage eect of GED
receipt by marginal distributions of cognitive and noncognitive ability.

Figure 13 shows the estimated distributions of noncognitive ability for dropouts and dierent types of GED recipients
from Heckman and Urzua [2010]. Consistent with dierences displayed in Figures 10 and 11, it shows that all GEDs,
except those with some college, are below uncredentialed dropouts in noncognitive ability. Figure 14, reproduced
from Heckman et al. [2010], shows how the eect of GED certication on wages varies by levels of individual skill
type. It shows that the marginal benet of increasing a decile of noncognitive ability for GEDs, especially in the
bottom two deciles, is greater than the marginal benet of increasing a decile of cognitive ability. This analysis
conrms the ndings of Heckman et al. [2006] that there are positive returns to both noncognitive and cognitive
ability in low skill labor markets.

A key observation is that GEDs are typically far down in the distribution of noncognitive ability. As discussed in

34

the next section, noncognitive ability is also a key characteristic for predicting which individuals will successfully
use the GED to obtain post-secondary training.

3.2 Educational Attainment
Patterns of Post-Secondary Enrollment and Persistence:

As noted above, the GED is widely accepted as

a prerequisite for admission to post-secondary education. Thus it serves as an intermediate step to obtaining more
valuable credentials. In 2008, 60% of GED test takers self-reported further education as a reason for taking the
test. Of this 60%, 20% planned on enrolling in four year college, 28% in two year college, and 22% in a technical
or trade program [GED Testing Service, 1958-2008]. Figure 15 presents time trends in the motivation to use the
GED for post-secondary education, showing an awareness of the increasing returns to college. As the college-high
school wage gap has grown, so has the percentage of GED recipients planning further education.

Few GEDs follow through with these plans. A recent study by the GED Testing Service [Patterson et al., 2009]
followed 1,000 randomly selected individuals who passed the GED test after the increase in test diculty in 2002.
It found that 31% ever enrolled in a post-secondary institution of any kind, and that 77% of those who ever enrolled
did so for only a single semester.

28 , 29 As documented in the Patterson

et al. [2009] report, many GEDs enrolled in college by age 22 but very few went on to ever earn degrees or complete
a meaningful amount of post-secondary education.

In contrast to the trend of self-reported plans in Figure 15,

30 Figure 17 demonstrates that by 2006,

fewer GED recipients had enrolled by age 22 in NLSY97 than in NLSY79.

when the NLSY79 sample is in their 40s, very few GEDs managed to earn four year credentials although more earn
associates degrees. As we discuss below, this trend may also be due to changes in the composition of GED test
takers which is increasingly younger and more likely to attempt the GED through institutional requirements.

Causal analysis of outcomes pertaining to post-secondary education through the GED:

GED recipients

receive tangible improvements in their labor market outcomes when they complete post-secondary education. A
summary of the qualitative ndings and approaches of selected papers in this literature is presented in table 9.

Cameron and Heckman [1993] calculate the option value or expected benet of GED receipt through a wide array of
types of post-secondary trainingon- and o-the-job training, military service, and two and four year collegeas the

28 We

compare NLSY79 and NLSY97 at age 22 as it is the oldest age reached by the entire NLSY97 sample. The low rates of earned

bachelor's/four year college degrees is explained by the fact that many students in this young sample are still working towards their
degrees, given their relatively young age and the number of individuals reporting current enrollment in four year college in the NLSY97
survey.

29 Murnane

et al. [1997] contains a table that displays participation rates by degrees of participation in post-secondary activities

including on-the-job training, o-the-job training, college and military. These gures are divided by level of nal educational attainment
and by gender. Their table is reproduced in Section C.3 of the Web Appendix (http://jenni.uchicago.edu/GEDHandbookChapter/).

30 Sampling

variation may explain this trend across NLSY79 and NLSY97 samples given that relatively few GEDs attempt post-

secondary training. Another possible factor, discussed below, is that the composition of GED test takers has changed for the worse.

associated with further education is much larger than the direct eect of GED receipt. Murnane et al. [1999] nd
strongly signicant hourly wage and income premiums conditional on receiving these types of training, but note
that few GEDs receive them. Murnane et al. [1997] use the same NLSY79 data as both of these studies and conrm
that, net of controls, GEDs pursue more of these types of post-secondary education than dropouts, but that the
predicted rates of completion are very low.

Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua [2006], Heckman, Urzua, and Veramendi [2010], and Heckman and Urzua [2010]
study the probability of selecting higher levels of educational attainment as a function of cognitive and noncognitive

GED for higher levels of education. Each approach studies the net present value (NPV) of income for individuals of
a given skill set and choice of education level. Heckman and Urzua [2010] use a dynamic discrete choice framework
where individuals make a sequence of decisions based on their expected income returns and psychological costs and
payos (i.e. non-pecuniary factors that inuence individual decisions beyond just income returns). Heckman and
Urzua [2010] estimate option values, which are the benets conferred by completing one stage of education in
terms of access to the returns of later stages of education. The option value associated with an educational choice
at a given level of education is dened as the NPV of future educational decisions that choice opens up, net of the
NPV of staying at the same level of education. For an individual with a given set of cognitive and noncognitive
skills, the option value of the GED equals the returns that individual would receive from post-secondary education
multiplied by the probability that they would choose and successfully complete that education.

Figure 18 shows for white males the respective probabilities of being a terminal dropout and of obtaining a GED
based on population deciles of cognitive and noncognitive ability. 1 represents the lowest decile and 10 represents
the highest. The rst panel (A) shows that the probability of being a terminal dropout is primarily associated with
low cognitive ability. The second panel (B) shows that, relative to the probability of dropping out, the probability
of obtaining a GED is higher for higher levels of cognitive ability, and is higher for lower levels of noncognitive
ability.

Figure 19 shows the estimated option values of the GED as a function of cognitive and noncognitive ability. The
option value increases sharply in both cognitive and noncognitive ability. The axes of this graph represent population
deciles. Very few dropouts are in the upper deciles of cognitive or noncognitive ability. As is evident from Figure
degree is decisively higher than that for a complete two year (associate) degree, there is no consensus on which type of college is
associated with higher returns to earned credits that are not associated with degree completion.

32 Like

Heckman et al. [2006], Heckman and Urzua [2010] use the Rosenberg and Rotter scores to measure noncognitive ability.

4 Changes and Growth in the GED Test Taking Population
Given the low returns to GED certication for the majority of GED test takers, the question remains why GED
certication has reached such a large scale and continues to grow. As shown in Figure 1, the GED program grew
from 50,000 takers in 1960 to over one million in 2001. A recent increase in the test's diculty paired with the
introduction of a new test series led to a decrease in takers in 2002, but growth resumed afterward with 700,000
people taking the test in 2008. In this section we review several explanations for the growth of the GED testing

41

program over time. We show the signicant role of government programs which both directly and indirectly subsidize
the cost of GED certication. Much of the recent growth has occurred in populations such as younger teenagers
and the incarcerated, populations that the literature shows have low expected benet to GED certication.

4.1 Government Education and Training Programs
Many government educational and job training programs have adopted the GED as a second chance program. These

33 and Adult Education programs.

include government programs such as Job Corps, state anti-poverty programs,

The GED test is used as a standardized, external measure of success for programs providing education. Figure 20
shows that 50% of individuals in the NLSY97 report obtaining the GED through either Adult Education programs
or another job training program, demonstrating the role these government programs play in promoting the GED.

Adult Education is the largest government program promoting and subsidizing GED preparation and certication.
The Adult Basic Education Act was signed into law in 1964. It was intended to provide funding for educating people
aged 18 and older who lacked basic skills such as reading and basic arithmetic [National Advisory Council on Adult
Education, 1980]. The program expanded in 1970 to include Adult Secondary Education (ASE), which focused on

34 The GED was quickly adopted by ASE programs as both a goal and a

high school-level learning [Rose, 1991].

33 One

example, documented in Quinn [2002], is of welfare reform initiatives in Ohio which paid mothers for sending their teenagers

to attend GED classes.

34 With

the introduction of ASE, the age requirement was decreased to 16. Adult Education was extended to incarcerated populations

metric of program success. Adult Education programs are not homogeneous. They range from stand-alone GED
classes to programs bundling job and vocational training with GED preparation.

Adult Education is a signicant producer of GED certicates. In 1975, 26% of GED credentials were issued through
Adult Education, increasing to 40% by 1980 and 50% in 1990 [U.S. Department of Education, Various Years].
In 1995, six times as many people achieved a GED rather than a traditional high school diploma through Adult
Education [National Advisory Council on Adult Education, Various Years]. McLaughlin et al. [2009] examine the
preparation methods for 90,000 GED test takers, and nd that 46% of the sample took the GED through an Adult

graphed against the number of GED test takers. Expansion of Adult Basic Education promoted the growth of the
GED. Figure 22 shows the proportions of individuals taking dierent routes of preparation for the GED test.

4.2 Changes in the Costs and Benets to Education
The costs and benets of being a dropout, of GED certication, and of college completion have changed over time.
These shifts play key roles in determining who selects into GED certication. As discussed in Section 2, the wage
in 1981, though total expenditures on incarcerated education programs was capped at 20% of total Adult Education funding.

35 These

90,000 were chosen from a larger sample, removing individuals facing institutional inuences on testing such as those in states

requiring a practice test or being in prison.

premium associated with getting any level of education above that of dropping out has been stable or increasing

At the same time, both the nancial and eort costs to education have changed.

completion has increased in terms of class hours needed to graduate (measured in Carnegie Units

implementation of exit exams that must be passed in order to graduate. The late 1980s saw growth in the number
of Carnegie Units required for graduation increasing from an average of 13.5 in 1985 to 17.4 in 1990. Only one state
required an exit exam to earn a high school diploma in 1980, increasing to twenty-two states by 2008. Warren et al.
[2006] show that completion rates decrease, and 16-to-19-year-old GED testing rates increase when high school exit
exams are introduced. The increasing diculty of high school may induce more students to dropout or to GED
certify thinking that they can then go straight to college.

The monetary costs of college have also grown in the last three decades.

From 1985 to 2005 the real cost of

public and private four year colleges grew, respectively, by 95% and 83% [National Center for Education Statistics,
Various Years].

On the other hand, Federal assistance may have lowered the cost for some individuals.

establishment of Pell grants in 1972 decreased the costs of post-secondary education for individuals with high

school-level credentials, including the GED. Figure 23 displays Pell grant funding and GED test-taking rates across
time. The spike in the average age of GED test takers in 1972, shown in Figure 26, is due to a number of older
dropouts seeking the GED to become eligible for Pell grants when they rst became available. This demonstrates
the responsiveness of GED test taking to incentives to participate in complementary programs.

Monetary costs of GED certication have always been nominal. Testing fees for taking the GED range from $0 to
$100, and enrollment in programs such as Adult Education often leads to reduced-fee or free testing [GED Testing
Service, 1958-2008]. On the other hand, the diculty of passing the GED test has increased over time. National
minimum diculty has increased three times, but many states have consistently required higher passing standards.
Figure 24 displays the population-weighted average GED diculty, measured by the percentage of graduation-bound
high school seniors estimated to be able to pass the GED in a single try. The eect of an increase in the diculty
of the test is seen in the dramatic decline in 2001 shown in Figure 23.

Incarceration and Prison Education

The number of incarcerated individuals in the United States has grown

rapidly since the mid 1970s. Figure 25 plots the total incarceration rate from 1926 to 2005, adding racial breakdowns
starting in 1981. Growth occurs across all race groups, with a disproportionate amount coming from blacks. Faced

with a growing population of the incarcerated, prison educational programs have been promoted on the basis of the
belief that education will decrease recidivism. The GED has quickly become a key ingredient in prison education
programs [United States Sentencing Commission, 2009]. In Federal prisons, inmates without a secondary degree
are required to complete 240 hours of class work, or to GED certify [United States Sentencing Commission, 2009].
Incarcerated individuals can qualify for monetary compensation for earning a GED as well as earning credits towards
early release [Ekstrand 2001, U.S. Department of Justice 2008]. Furthermore, in 1995, the incarcerated made up
9% of all Adult Education participants [National Advisory Council on Adult Education, Various Years]. A Bureau
of Justice Statistics (BJS) special report states that in 1997, 26% of all prison inmates earned a GED in prison

38 Figure 10 shows the percent of GEDs produced in prison which has grown consistently from 1994

[Harlow, 2003].

to 2005. Overall, the GED has become a near-mandatory component of the prison education system. The growth
of prison GEDs weakens its overall signaling value by its association with criminality.

Tyler and Kling [2007] study the post-release earnings of individuals who studied for the GED in prison.

They

use longitudinal data from the Florida Department of Corrections and other Florida state agencies to compare preand post-incarceration earnings for those who study for and receive GEDs. They nd that GED preparation and
receipt are associated with an increase in earnings for the rst three years after release, but fade thereafter. The

47

positive initial impact might be explained by non-random institutional sorting of individuals and by self-selection.
To net out self-selection, the authors also compare earnings of those obtaining a GED with those that take GED
preparation classes but do not earn a credential. They nd no eect. Because both of these populations undertook
some amount of study, this nding rules out a signaling eect of the GED.
There is a substantial literature that studies the impact of prison-based educational systems with a focus on
recidivism, but this work faces signicant challenges in addressing the endogeneity of educational attainment and
the lack of baseline data on prior to imprisonment.

Gaes [2009] surveys this literature and highlights the eect

of GED receipt, as well as vocational training and Adult Basic Education training, on post-release wages and
recidivism. Results from studies that he identies as methodologically sound are generally mixed with eects that
are either very modest or statistically insignicant.

4.3 Growth in High School-Age Test Takers
In 1955, as more states began oering the GED to civilians, the American Council of Education implemented a
minimum age of 20 for taking the GED test to prevent teen-aged students from seeking the GED as a replacement
for high school [Quinn, 2002]. In 1970, the national age requirement was lowered to 18. Following a period between
1981 and 1992 where there was no national age requirement, the national minimum has been set at 16. Many states
set age requirements above the national minimum. Figure 26 shows the population-weighted average national age
requirement for taking the GED and the average age of GED test takers over time.

The sharp fall in both age

requirement and average age in the early 1970s represents the expansion of the population eligible to take the GED.
Originally, states granted exceptions to age requirements in specic cases, such as teenage pregnancy. The number of
exceptions to age restrictions has greatly increased over time, leading to growth in the number of 16-to-17-year-olds
attempting the GED. The two relevant age restrictions for taking the GED are the statutory age requirement and,
indirectly, the minimum age that students can drop out of high school. Figure 27 plots the percentage of GED test
takers qualifying as age exceptions to the minimum testing age, and the percentage of GED test takers qualifying as
both an exception to the minimum testing age and the minimum age for compulsory high school attendance. Both
series are increasing with GED age exceptions growing from 6% in 1980 to nearly 14% in 2007, and dual exceptions
growing from 1% in 1990 to over 6% in 2007 Humphries [2010].
Trends in the age composition of GED takers reect these changes in eligibility and institutional allowances. Figure
28 shows the number of test takers by age.

The rst panel shows that growth since the early 1980s is almost

completely attributable to growth in 16-to-19-year-old takers. Test taking rates were distinguished between 16-to17-year-old and 18-to-19-year-old takers in 1980. The second panel shows that 16-to-17-year-olds are responsible
for virtually all growth in GED test taking within the 16-to-19 age group. Because these individuals are still of
high school age, their growth as a group raises the question of whether the GED is serving as a true second chance
opportunity or as a substitute for a more valuable high school degree. Of particular concern is the possibility that
teenagers with the lowest levels of noncognitive skills are the most likely to opt out of high school in order to receive
the GED and least likely to benet from doing so.

The decision-making process of teens may lead them to make choices that restrict their educational paths and

may increase the rate of ill-advised dropping out. Many state-issued GED certicates have names such as Kansas
State High School Diploma or Maryland High School Diploma which mislead students into false expectations of
equivalence with traditional high school [GED Testing Service, 1958-2008].

The GED Option Programs represent another institutional path to GED certication for high school students. In
some states, the American Council on Education has approved programs which directly target at-risk students in
high school and guide them toward GED certication. While states set their own determination of at-risk, this

an institutional shift toward younger populations.

39 The

literature in psychology formally recognizes this as time-inconsistent preferences, where teens may discount future outcomes at

a higher rate than they would at full maturity. Recent work in neuroscience gives concrete support to the common notion that teens
in late adolescencethe period when the decision to drop out is mademake decisions that are inconsistent with their adult preferences.
See Steinberg [2007] and Steinberg [2008].

40 See the GED Option Statistical Report [GED Testing Service, 2008] for more detail on these programs.
41 Virginia for example has a demanding Option Program requiring 15 hours of academic preparation per week,

work- or career-based

training for 10 hours a week, and scores of 450 on each subsection of the ocial practice test (higher than the 410 minimum 450 average
state passing requirement for the GED) before GED certication is allowed. On the other hand, Oregon allows the requirements to be
set to a much higher degree by the institution allowing much more exibility including self-study, and technology-assisted study as a
means of GED preparation. Similarly, the hours of studying and days enrolled in the option program also vary greatly. For example,
Oregon's GED Option participants reported studying for a median of 20 hours with few explicit requirements. Louisiana, on the other
hand, reported a mean of 150 hours and require 15 hours of academic preparation per week and 10 hours a week of job training.

Notes: The categories of GED credentials are not mutually exclusive; an individual may be counted in multiple categories.
Years missing specic categories are due to missing data. Specic years have been excluded from the graph due to highly
incomplete data. Prior to 1990, the age categories are imputed from the percent of GED test takers in the specic age category
times the number of credentials. Adult Education statistics did not separate between GEDs and high school diplomas after
1996. From 1997 to 2006 the numbers are imputed by multiplying the total number of GEDs and high school diplomas issued
by the average ratio of GEDs to GEDs plus high school diplomas from 1991 to 1996.

4.4 Summing up the Sources of Growth of GEDs
Since its introduction, the GED has grown rapidly.

This rapid growth occurs despite the GED's low economic

returns. The growth of the GED can be credited to the adoption of the GED by government and non-prot entities,
as well as the expansion of the GED into new populations. Figure 29 shows the number of total credentials issued
each year, as well as the number of credentials contributed by Adult Education, prison populations, 16-to-17-year-old
GED test takers and 18-to-19-year-old GED test takers. These four categories each account for a large percentage
of the credentials issued. Unfortunately, the promotion of the GED has pushed it further from subpopulations that
might potentially benet from it. The test has expanded to younger populations which provides adverse incentives
to high school-age individuals discussed in more detail below. Figure 30 and 31 provide a time line of key events in
the growth of the GED.

5 Adverse Consequences of the GED
The GED's low returns may be unfortunate, but one might argue that its low costs and low returns balance and
may not do much harm. In this section we show that its availability and scale does cause harm. One concern is that
the availability of the GED as an easier-to-obtain secondary credential induces many individuals to drop out of high
school. The alternative to GED receipt for these individuals is high school completion and not dropping out. An
additional harm arises from counting GEDs in graduation statistics. This practice hides declines in traditional high
school graduation rates and thus has disguised educational problems. Finally, the practice of improperly counting
the GED as a high school diploma generates biased estimates of the returns to education.

5.1 The GED Induces Would-Be High School Graduates to Drop Out
The availability of the test induces some students to drop out and seek a GED rather than persist in high school.
Several papers in the literature demonstrate that changes in the relative costs of the GED certication and high
school completion induce substitutions of one degree for the other at dierent margins. Lillard and DeCicca [2001]
demonstrates that the number of students who drop out of high school (including GEDs) increases when the number
of credits needed to graduate increases. They estimate that a standard deviation increase in the course graduation
requirements in the US would cause 26,000 to 65,000 individuals to drop out of high school. Chaplin [1999] provides
descriptive evidence that high school-aged students are dropping out to take the GED and that requiring parental
consent helps curb this practice.

Humphries [2010] demonstrate that 16-to-17-year-old GED test taking rates

respond to high school credit requirements, minimum high school dropout age, and the diculty of the GED test.
He estimates that a minimum dropout age of 18 policy would decrease state-wide GED test taking by 0.22% of the
entire population of 16-to-17-year-olds. He also nds that an increase the diculty of the GED so that 10% fewer
graduation-bound high school seniors could pass the test would decrease state-wide GED test taking by 0.14% of

rates respond to the presence of high school exit exams and other state high school policies. They report that a
high school exit exam leads to a state-wide increase in GED test taking of 0.12% of the entire 16-to-19-year-old
population.
Heckman et al. [2008] analyze two large natural experiments to study the eect of introducing the GED on inducing
dropouts. The national minimum diculty for passing the GED increased in 1997 which forced only a subset of

42 Median

54

states to increase their passing standards to be compliant.

The increase raised the diculty of the test so that

only 60% rather than 66% of graduation bound high school seniors would be able to pass the test on a single try.
The study also looks at the eect of California's introduction of a GED credential in 1974. Dierence-in-dierences
estimates show that these two policy changes resulted in a 1.3% decrease in dropout rates for states where the

43

passing standard increased, and 3.1% fall in high school graduation rates when the GED became available.

Humphries [2010] examines the eect of introducing GED Option Programs at the school district level using data

44 Using school district-level panel data from Oregon with year and district xed eects, Humphries

from Oregon.

nds that introduction of these programs at the district level or in traditional high schools led to a fall of approximately 5% in four year high school completion rates. Interestingly, in districts where the Option Program was only
introduced in alternative institutions, such as community colleges or charter schools, the eect was a decrease of

45

only 1.8%.

Heckman et al. [2008] and Humphries [2010] demonstrate that the GED induces some would-be high school graduates
into dropping out, but we do not know which individuals drop out or how successful they would have been if they had
stayed in high school. The dynamic model of Heckman and Urzua [2010] can be used to simulate counterfactuals.
Table 11 contrasts the actual patterns of educational attainment of white males in the NLSY79 sample with predicted
values if the GED were abolished. Not all GEDs persist as dropouts. Of the 3.7% of the sample that obtains a
terminal GED or some college through the GED, only 2.3% remain as dropouts in the counterfactual state, whereas
the rest either nish high school or complete higher levels of post-secondary education. While this line of structural
research is still being rened, it has the promise of generating the likely eects on educational attainment arising
from enforced age limits or increased test diculty. The magnitudes in Table 11 are broadly consistent with the
estimates reported from natural experiments in Heckman et al. [2008].

5.2 The GED Inates High School Graduation Statistics
The high school graduation rate is a barometer of the health of American society and the skill level of its future
workforce. Historically, the U.S. graduation rate continued to climb as schooling became increasingly important.
This trend, however, counts GEDs as high school graduates. When GEDs are counted separately, the traditional
high school graduation rate was falling until 2000.

Two commonly-used measures of the high school graduation rate are reported by the National Center of Education
Statistics (NCES). The rst is the high school status completion rate which counts the number of 18-to-24-yearolds possessing a high school credential and divides it by the population aged 18 to 24. The second is the 17-year-old
graduation ratio, which is the number of diplomas issued in any given state divided by their 17-year-old population
in a given year. The former includes the GED as a high school credential; the latter does not.

Figure 32 shows the time path of both measures, including the completion rate by race. The overall completion rate
and 17 year-old graduation ratio were relatively similar in 1968 but diverged afterward. High school graduation
was falling from the 1970s through about year 2000, The US graduation rate has only recently returned to where
it was forty years ago.

The dierences between status completion rates and the graduation ratio has previously been noted. Most of the
gap comes from alternative certications which are predominantly GEDs [Finn, 1987]. Once the nonequivalence
of GEDs to high school graduates is demonstrated, the growing gap in the status completion rate and graduation
ratio becomes a great concern. Rather than an 88% graduation rate in the recent decade, estimates were reported
as low as 66% as several researchers made eorts to construct correct high school graduation rates not counting
GEDs as high school graduates (Greene [2001], Swanson [2004], Miao and Haney [2004], Warren [2005]).

These

corrected estimates varied depending on the data set and methodology used, leading to further confusion over which
number was the real graduation rate.

Heckman and LaFontaine [2010] systematically examine each data set used in this debate and consider sources of

56

Statistics (NCES) publication Dropout Rates in the United States: 2005 (Laird et al. [2007]). Notes: Rates prior to 1972 are
based on author's calculations using Current Population Survey (CPS) data. The status completion rate is the percentage of
18-to24-year-olds not enrolled in secondary school who have a high school credential. High school credentials include regular
diplomas and alternative credentials such as GED certicates. Hispanic ethnicity is not available before 1972. The 17-yearold graduation ratio is from the Digest of Education Statistics. HS graduates for the graduation ratio include both public
and private school diplomas and exclude GED recipients and other certicates. October 17-year-old population estimates
are obtained from Census Bureau P-20 reports.

year 2000 Census data, removing GEDs lowers overall graduation rates by 7.4%. Because of dierential rates of
alternative credentialing, graduation rates fall by dierent amounts for dierent groups: 8.1% for males, 6.6% for
females, 10.3% for black males, and 8.7% for black females.

While the completion rates by race shown in Figure 32 shows a decreasing white-black and white-Hispanic high
school certication rate over time, those trends are fully explained by increasing rates of alternative certication.

5.3 The GED Obscures the Actual Returns to Education
The misclassication of GEDs also aects estimates of the returns to education. While the dropout-to-high school
and high school-to-college wage gaps have indeed been increasing, the GED misclassication is responsible for a

58

sizable amount of this gap. Using the traditional CPS method of treating GED recipients and high school graduates
as equivalent, Cameron and Heckman [1993] estimate a 21% return to four year college completion. When classifying
GEDs and high school graduates separately, the high school-to-college gap falls to 19.6%.

Heckman and LaFontaine [2006] show that the imputation method used by the CPS generates biased wages across
educational levels. The CPS imputes missing wages by matching on socioeconomic data using other observations in
the same educational categories: 1) high school dropouts; 2) high school graduates with up to, but not including, a
bachelor's degree; and 3) bachelor's degree or above. This procedure allocates missing GED wages with data drawn
from high school graduates (including individuals with some college), and lls in missing high school graduate
wages with data drawn from GEDs. Heckman and LaFontaine nd that estimated returns to GED certication
were overstated by 35% when CPS allocated wages are included for native-born males, and 25% for native-born
females. Similarly, they nd that excluding allocated earners lowers the returns to high school graduation for the
full sample of males by 5% and the returns to college by 12%. The fact that the CPS increasingly reports missing
values, coupled with the misallocation error of GED and high school wages, has lead to increasingly biased estimates
of the returns to education over time.

Table 12 displays evidence from three birth cohorts within the NLSY79 sample to compare how high school-tocollege and dropout-to-high school wage dierentials vary depending on how GED recipients are classied. Because
the number of GED recipients grows from 9% of high school credentials to 20% across these birth cohorts, the bias
the GED generates in returns to educational categories also increases over time. For the 1957-1958 birth cohort,
GED misclassication accounts for 6.1% of the college-high school wage gap in log annual earnings. By the 19621964 birth cohort, GED misclassication grew to 9.5% of the college-high school wage gap in log annual earnings
and 5.6% of the dropout-college wage gap.

6 Conclusion
This chapter reviews the scholarly literature on the General Educational Development certicate. The consensus
in the literature is that the GED testing program does little good for the substantial majority of its takers in
generating economic opportunity directly and in opening the door to post-secondary education.

especially troubling given the size and rate of growth of the GED. Growth in the GED appears to be largely fueled
by various government policies. Until recently, misclassication of the GED as a high school equivalent credential has

Table 12: The Role of the GED in Explaining Rising Educational Wage Gaps

Source: Reproduced from Heckman and LaFontaine [2010] who use NLSY79 data on males and females aged 25-29. Notes: The college
category includes those with a four year degree or higher. Those with some college and no two or four year degree are included in the
GED and HS categories, respectively, depending on their credential. Two year degree holders are estimated separately. All education
dummies are mutually exclusive. Estimated wage gaps are based on the following 3 OLS specications; Model 1: GEDs are included as
HS graduates; Model 2: GEDs treated separately; and Model 3: GEDs treated as dropouts. Persons enrolled in school at each age are
deleted as are those who are not working or self-employed. Those making less than $2 or more than $100 per hour are deleted as are
those making less than $100 or more than $4,000 weekly. In addition, those making less than $2,000 or more than $200,000 are dropped.
Region dummies are included in all regressions but are not shown. Percentages of GEDs are calculated using sampling weights. Weekly
wage estimates are weighted by weeks worked last year. Hourly wage estimates are weighted by hours worked last year. Huber-white
robust standard errors clustered by individual are reported.

The study of the GED sheds considerable light on the value of noncognitive skills and the danger of relying solely
on tests of scholastic aptitude to monitor the success of American educational policy.
