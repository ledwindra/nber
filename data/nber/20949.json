    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper examines heterogeneity in the responsiveness to default options in a large state retirement plan, focusing on individuals\u2019 decision-making approaches as well as their economic and demographic characteristics. Using a survey of plan participants, we find that procrastination and the need for cognitive closure are important determinants of the likelihood of default. We also explore an important implication of defaulting \u2013 individuals who default are significantly more likely to subsequently express a desire to enroll in a different plan. The desire to change plans is also correlated with numerous economic and decision-making characteristics, including procrastination.\n\n",
