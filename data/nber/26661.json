    "abstract": "\n\nThis article reviews the recent literature in economics on small-scale entrepreneurship (\"microentrepreneurship\") in low-income countries. Major themes in the literature include the determinants and consequences of joining the formal sector; the impacts of access to credit and other financial services; the impacts of business training; barriers to hiring; and the distinction between self-employment by necessity and self-employment as a calling. The article devotes special attention to unique issues that arise with female entrepreneurship.\n\n",
