Should Flavors be Banned in E-cigarettes? Evidence on Adult Smokers and Recent Quitters
from a Discrete Choice Experiment

ABSTRACT
E-cigarettes are available in over 7,000 flavors, whereas all flavors but menthol are banned in
combustible cigarettes. The FDA recently requested a ban on e-cigarette flavors, but was rejected.
The FDA is again considering this ban and also a ban on menthol in combustible cigarettes, but
there is little information on the impacts of alternative bans on the market for combustible and ecigarettes. Our study provides these much-needed estimates. We conduct a discrete choice
experiment on a nationally representative sample of 2,031 adult smokers and recent quitters that
we collected. We estimate preferences for flavors and other attributes and use these preferences to
predict the demand for each cigarette type and for “none of these.” We then predict the impact of
alternative bans and compare results for the current treatment of flavors to results for the
alternative bans. We find that the recently denied FDA ban would result in increased choice of
combustible cigarettes, the most harmful alternative. However, a ban on menthol in combustibles
would result in the greatest reduction in smoking of combustibles. Our results are timely and
policy-relevant, suggesting which flavor bans are likely to be most effective in protecting public
health.

INTRODUCTION
Currently in the U.S., e-cigarettes are available in over 7,000 flavors, but all flavors except
menthol are banned in combustible cigarettes. E-cigarettes, which are relatively new, are
increasingly popular in the U.S. but have been largely unregulated. This is in contrast to
combustible cigarettes, which have a very long history, have become less popular over time, and
are now highly regulated by the U.S. government. The growth in e-cigarette use has led to concern
over their impacts on the health of the public and interests in regulating them at different levels of
the government. 1 At the national level, the Center for Tobacco Products of the Federal Drug
Agency (FDA) that recently gained authority over tobacco products and is considering banning
flavors in both e-cigarettes and also menthol in combustibles. Banning flavors has also been
suggested by public health experts (Ribisl et al., 2016a). However, e-cigarette regulation is
complicated by lack of evidence about their impact on health and varying perceptions as to the
extent to which e-cigarettes are less harmful than combustibles (Kenkel, 2016; Ribisl et al., 2016b).
The Health Impact of E-cigarettes
Differences in the health impact of e-cigarettes can occur either due to differences that are
inherent to the cigarette itself or related to how and why e-cigarettes are used. E-cigarettes are
believed to be inherently less harmful to both the user and those around them because they do not
burn tobacco (Royal College of Physicians, 2016). It is the burning of tobacco and its addictiveness
due to nicotine that result in cancer and other health harms. Instead of burning tobacco, e-cigarettes
use a heating filament to vaporize a liquid that make them less harmful. And consequently, e-

There are also 79 countries that have implemented some e-cigarette regulations and Kennedy et al. (2017). For
example, the UK implemented a minimum age of 18 for e-cigarettes (Department of Health, 2015)

2

cigarettes do not produce harmful secondhand smoke. Also, because e-cigarettes typically, but not
always, contain nicotine, there may be less concern about addiction.
In addition to the inherent differences between e-cigarettes and combustibles, there are
important differences in how they are used that could affect public health. E-cigarettes are used in
ways that are beneficial to health to the extent that: 1) smokers switch to e-cigarettes, 2) smokers
use them as a cessation device, and 3) youths may choose them over combustibles. These benefits
not only help the smoker, or would-be-smoker, but also the non-smoker due to the lack of
secondhand smoke. However, in contrast, e-cigarettes may be harmful to public health to the extent
that they: attract new smokers (adult or youth) of combustibles and serve as method for current
smokers of combustibles to skirt bans on smoking in public places and thus maintain their
addiction. The net effect of these offsetting impacts is unknown.
Although there is insufficient evidence to draw clear conclusions on the impact of the offsetting
effects of e-cigarettes on smoker behavior, there is nonetheless evidence for several of the above
points. First, evidence suggests that current smokers on the whole may be either helped or
unaffected by e-cigarettes (Shahab et al., 2017; Goniewicz et al., 2017). Second, recent studies
find that current smokers use e-cigarettes as a harm reduction method and/or as a cessation device
(Hartman-Boyce et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2017). In fact, e-cigarettes are more attractive to smokers
than some of the alternative cessation medications and nicotine replacement therapy devices.
Regarding adult use, e-cigarettes are used almost exclusively by current smokers and recent
quitters (Glasser et al., 2017). Indeed, because e-cigarettes are rarely banned in public places,
current smokers may use e-cigarettes to maintain their nicotine addiction despite smoking bans
(Marti et al., 2016).

3

Evidence is not yet clear as to the net impact of e-cigarettes on youths. E-cigarettes may attract
mainly those youths who would have used combustibles, thus offering relative protection.
Alternatively, e-cigarettes may serve as a gateway to the use of combustibles (Gostin and Glasnet,
2014). Surprisingly, it is estimated that most youths (up to 80 percent) “vape” e-cigarettes without
nicotine (Meich et al., 2017), which mitigates the concern about the gateway effect, as there is
much less risk of nicotine addiction and, perhaps reducing the risk later use of combustibles.
Flavor Availability in Cigarettes and E-cigarettes
One important difference between the two cigarette types that may affect net harm of ecigarettes is the availability of flavors in e-cigarettes. All flavors but menthol have been banned in
combustibles at the federal level, but none have been banned for e-cigarettes nationally in the U.S.
This stark difference likely impacts the choice of combustibles, e-cigarettes, or abstinence. Thus,
to the extent that flavors make e-cigarettes more appealing (Berg et al., 2014; Berg, 2016; Patel et
al., 2016), they could potentiate the public health impact of e-cigarettes either positively or
negatively. Specifically, a ban on flavored e-cigarettes might drive those who like flavors toward
combustibles. Or such a ban might reduce the overall smoking rate by eliminating a popular
alternative. Similarly, a ban on only menthol combustibles might drive menthol smokers to ecigarettes. 2 The first effect would be relatively harmful; the second beneficial. If all flavors are
banned, both smokers and youths who have not yet initiated use of either cigarette type might be
more inclined to abstain from both.

2

Menthol cigarettes are used disproportionately by African American smokers and by youths (Rock et al 2010;
Giovino et al., 2013). It is thought that the ‘cooling effect’ of menthol makes smoking less harsh for first-time
smokers, thus the appeal to youths; menthol cigarettes are falsely believed to be healthier, which may increase its
appeal (Anderson, 2011).

4

Thus, a disruption to the status quo of flavor availability due to flavor bans is likely to drive
smokers to different cigarette choices, or to choose none. Consequently, it is difficult to know the
net impact of flavor bans due to the multiple, potentially offsetting impacts. There are no
empirically-based predictions of the net impact of different flavor bans. Yet to ensure the most
positive impact of such bans, it is important to understand the offsetting, net effects.
FDA Regulations Concerning Flavors: The Current Landscape
In 2016, the FDA gained the authority to regulate e-cigarettes and other tobacco products. 3
Prior to this, the FDA had the authority to regulate only if e-cigarettes were marketed for
therapeutic purposes (though none were), and this was done by another branch of the FDA. 4 The
authority to regulate e-cigarettes followed the FDA being granted the authority to regulate the
manufacturing, marketing, and sales of other tobacco products through the 2009 Family Smoking
Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. The Tobacco Control Act mandated that in regulating
tobacco products, the new branch of the FDA had to pursue the goal of protecting the health of the
public. This means that the FDA is to consider the societal impact and not only assess the safety
and effectiveness of drugs or devices, as required in other branches of the FDA. In addition, the
FDA must produce a full cost-benefit analysis prior to implementing a regulation (White House,
2011; Chaloupka et al., 2014). Thus, the full impact of regulations needs to be considered and
quantified, including impacts on those who could be newly drawn into or out of cigarette use and
the impact of secondhand smoke.
To protect the health of the public, in May 2016 the FDA requested a ban on flavors in ecigarettes and other newly covered products, at least until the agency had time to fully review the

impact of so-called characterizing flavors. 5 But this request to ban flavors was denied by the White
House Office of Management and Budget. The reasons for the denial are not publicly known.
Thus, the current situation is that flavors are not available in combustible cigarettes with the
exception of menthol, but in contrast there are no FDA restrictions on e-cigarette flavors.
Despite the recent dismissal of the FDA’s request, the issue of flavor bans is still relevant and,
in fact, timely. It is important to note that the FDA recently issued a statement indicating that it is
seeking approaches to regulating child-appealing flavors in e-cigarettes and may consider banning
menthol in combustibles FDA (2017). This has also been suggested in the literature (Ribisl et al.,
2016a). However, in the absence of national bans on flavors in e-cigarettes, cities and counties in
the U.S. have passed flavor bans on e-cigarettes and combustibles. Among the cities with flavor
bans are Berkeley, Hayward, and Manhattan Beach in California; Chicago; New York;
Boston/Cambridge; and Minneapolis/St. Paul. Other locations include California’s Santa Clara and
Yolo Counties. In addition, some of these cities have also passed bans on menthol cigarettes
(Tobacco Control Legal Consortium, 2017). 6 Thus, given the recent FDA statement and actions at
other levels of government, it is timely to consider the impact of alternative flavor bans on public
health.
With the potential for nationwide flavor bans for e-cigarettes, it is important to consider the
impact of alternative bans in order to choose those that are most beneficial. An optimal flavor ban
could serve to protect the health of society, while other bans might either be harmful or not be the
best approach. To select the best ban, the impact of alternative bans on the combustible and ecigarettes must be considered in tandem; flavors may drive choice of cigarette type and affect the

tobacco is not typically considered a “characterizing” flavor in e-cigarettes.

Parliament, 2014) and globaltobaccocontrol.org.

desire to abstain. Thus, quantitative information is needed on the likely impact of alternative flavor
bans, however, such information is not currently available.
We address the need for information on the likely impact of alternative flavor bans for ecigarettes and combustibles. Specifically, we provide useful predictions of the impact of
alternative flavor bans on the use of combustible cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and neither of these. We
estimate the impacts of a set of five alternative flavor bans on choice of cigarette type as compared
to the status quo. These estimates provide empirical guidance on the selection of optimal flavor
bans to protect public health.
To examine the potential impacts of alternative flavor ban policies across combustible and ecigarettes, we conduct an online discrete choice experiment (DCE). Specifically, we collect data
from a representative sample of 2,031 U.S. smokers and recent quitters ages 18 to 64. Using the
data from the experiment and the accompanying survey that we conduct, we estimate preferences
for flavors and cigarette types and heterogeneity across individual characteristics. Using these
regression results, we predict the demand for combustible and e-cigarette types under alternative
policies banning flavors while controlling for other characteristics of both types of cigarettes.
The five flavor banning policies that we examine are displayed in Table 1. This set of bans
includes: those currently in place; the FDA’s recently proposed ban; and four alternative flavor
bans for either or both combustible and e-cigarettes. For each policy, we predict the percentage of
each type that is selected based on our model results. Then, we discuss which flavor policy bans
would be optimal under alternative criteria for protecting public health.
We add to the literature in a number of ways. While some studies have examined the potential
impact of a ban on menthol combustible cigarettes (O’Connor et al., 2012; Da’Silva et al., 2015;
Levy et al., 2011; Kotlyar et al., 2015), only Da’Silva examined the impact on e-cigarette use.

7

Pesko et al. (2016) studied flavors and e-cigarettes, but did not make predictions. Studies have also
examined the impact of flavors on combustible cigarette use (Courtmanche et al., 2017) and the
prevalence of flavored tobacco product use (Villanti et al., 2017), but neither examined the impact
of potential bans on flavored e-cigarettes. We not only examine flavor bans on both types of
cigarettes, but we also examine the impact on choice of cigarette type. We also add to the literature
by collecting a large, current, nationally representative data set composed of current and former
smokers. In addition, we are the first to study how preferences for flavored cigarettes vary across
individual characteristics in a single study; the results across groups offer valid comparisons. Thus,
our methods are rigorous and our results are policy-relevant and timely.
METHDOS
Data and Sampling
We recruited a sample of 2,031 adult smokers and recent quitters online. 7 To be eligible,
current smokers and recent quitters had to have smoked at least 100 cigarettes, or equivalent ecigarettes, in their lifetime. Respondents had to be between ages 18 and 64 and U.S. residents. Our
sample size is large relative to other choice experiments in health, and it is in excess of minimum
sample size calculations of several hundred observations (de Bekker-Grob et al., 2015). To make
our sample nationally representative, respondents were drawn to match proportions of smokers in
regional/demographic quotas. The quotas were derived from data from the Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System (BRFSS) based on six geographical regions (New England, Mid-Atlantic,
Midwest, South, Southwest, and West), gender, and age bands (18–34, 35–49 and 50–64).
Discrete Choice Experiment

The survey firm Qualtrics was used.

We use a discrete choice experiment (DCE) with a survey conducted alongside. DCE is a
preference elicitation technique that allows estimation of the causal effect of products’
characteristics on individuals’ choices (in this case, the impact of cigarette flavors on cigarette
choices; see Louviere et al., 2000). It has been applied to health and health behaviors (AmayaAmaya et al., 2008; Louviere and Lancsar, 2009; de Bekke-Grob et al., 2012; Clark et al., 2014;
Vass et al., 2016), and in tobacco product studies (Ida and Goto, 2009; Regmi et al., 2017). The
DCE approach is used to estimate the effect of flavors on the choice of cigarette type and then to
predict the impact of flavored cigarette ban alternatives.
In our DCE, respondents are asked to respond to choice scenarios by choosing their favorite
among combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes or “choose none of these” options. 8 The choice
scenarios were generated based on the principle of D-optimality, which is common for DCEs
(Hensher et al., 2015), resulting in 36 choice scenarios. Respondents are randomized to three
blocks, such that each respondent responds to 12 scenarios. 9 In the scenarios, each of the cigarette
types is described by four attributes: flavor, health impact of smoking, amount of nicotine, and
price. In turn, each of these attributes has specific values, termed “levels.” For example, flavor is
an attribute, and tobacco, menthol, fruit, and sweet are levels. The set of cigarette types and
attributes is kept constant throughout each choice scenario, but the levels vary for each scenario.
Respondents’ choices form the data set that is used in our models to estimate the value of
preferences for the cigarette types and attribute levels. To increase the effective sample size,
respondents chose a first and second choice in each scenario; this is referred to as a best-best DCE

8

Because the choice options take the form of a specific cigarette, this is a ‘labeled’ experiment, which is beneficial
for realism (de Bekker-Grob et al., 2010)
9
This also helps to alter the order in which respondents face scenarios, though recent evidence finds that this does
not appear to be an issue (Pesko et al., 2016)

9

(Ghijben et al., 2014). That is, 2,031 respondents answer 12 choice scenarios each (n=24,372), but
as they make two choices per scenario rather than one, there is more preference information
gathered per observation. See Fig. 1 for a sample choice scenario.
We took several steps to increase the quality of responses. Prior to asking our sample to
respond to the DCE, we provided respondents with a detailed narrative and visual information. We
describe the cigarette types and their features used in the study, ensuring all respondents had an
equal base level of knowledge prior to responding. Next, we are clear with the terminology (note
that we use the same terminology throughout the paper). We use “cigarette type” as a general term
for combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes. By “flavor” we mean a flavor of cigarette independent
of its type, 10 e.g. “tobacco” or “menthol.” By “flavored cigarette” we mean the partnership of a
flavor and a cigarette type, e.g. “tobacco combustible cigarette” or “menthol e-cigarette.” Lastly,
a sample experimental task is provided before the full experiment, giving respondents practice in
responding.
The experimental design includes the cigarette types, attributes, and levels, as seen in Table 2.
The four attributes selected are considered key factors in consumer decisions. They are: flavors,
health risk, amount of nicotine, and price. The specific flavors were chosen to emulate cigarette
types currently available in the U.S. market: tobacco and menthol for cigarettes; and tobacco,
menthol, fruit, and sweet for e-cigarettes. While there are many flavors of e-cigarettes available
(Zhu et al., 2014; Kruseman et al., 2017), the overwhelming majority of these can be classified as
menthol, fruit, or sweet (Berg, 2016; Bonhomme et al., 2016; Pepper et al., 2016). Health risk was
expressed as years of life lost by the average user. For combustible cigarettes, this was set at 10 to
reflect the known harm. For e-cigarettes, four levels were used: 2, 5, 10 and unknown; these

10

Note that tobacco is a flavor that needs to be specifically added to the e-cigarette. This is in contrast to the
combustible cigarette which has a tobacco flavor naturally.

10

options reflect both the lower health risk of e-cigarettes and that their exact risk is not known
(Dinakar and O’Connor, 2016), helping to make the choices realistic. The levels of nicotine are
low, medium, and high. Both types of cigarettes are currently available in these levels. In addition,
a level of “none” was provided for e-cigarettes to make the choices realistic, as nicotine-free
options are available in e-cigarettes. Finally, we defined price as the price paid for 20 combustible
cigarettes or the equivalent volume of e-cigarettes. 11 We scanned the market for current prices and
developed a representative set. The prices used are $4.99, $7.99, $10.99, and $13.99. The “.99”
suffix connotes a retail purchase experience.
To complement the DCE, a survey was administered to collect socioeconomic data and
smoking behavior information on each respondent. These data allow the study of response
heterogeneity across these personal characteristics. Descriptive statistics of our sample are
reported in Table 2.
In addition to the above quality enhancements we also used “forced responses” to prevent
respondents from skipping through large sections of the survey. And we also used a minimum time
threshold 12 to remove respondents who rushed through. Finally, we used attention filters
embedded in the survey to check that respondents were paying attention (e.g. “please select option
two to show that you are paying attention”). Failed checks resulted in individuals being ejected
from the survey.
Cigarette Type Choice Model
Respondents were asked to select their preferred cigarette type in choice scenarios, so they are
assumed to be maximizing their utility when making choices (Louviere et al., 2000). We defined

11
12

We used a conversion ratio of 1 disposable cigarette/1 e-cigarette refill to 30 cigarettes.
Which is 1/3 of the median time taken in the pilot

11

a general cigarette type utility function that relates individuals’ choices to their preferences for
cigarette types and attributes:
𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈(𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐)
= 𝑓𝑓(𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐, 𝑓𝑓𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑐𝑐, 𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐, 𝑛𝑛𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐𝑓𝑓𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐, ℎ𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈ℎ 𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟)

(1).

This utility function serves as the basis for the empirical model. From (1), we can
straightforwardly build an econometric model to put numerical values on individuals’ ordinal
preferences (Hensher et al., 2015). Here, utility comprises an observed and unobserved
component, 𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , respectively. We then defined the observed component in terms of the
attributes and cigarette types,
𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 (𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐) = 𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗
= 𝛽𝛽𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 . 𝐹𝐹𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝛽𝛽𝑝𝑝𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑝𝑝 . 𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝛽𝛽𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑓𝑓𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑛𝑛𝑝𝑝 . 𝑁𝑁𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐𝑓𝑓𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗

(2),

+ 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗
where 𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is the utility that respondent i derives from cigarette type j in choice scenario c.

The utility is related to the cigarette’s attributes, namely flavor (𝐹𝐹𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑐𝑐), price (𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐), level
of nicotine (𝑁𝑁𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐𝑓𝑓𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐), and health risk (𝐻𝐻𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈ℎ 𝑅𝑅𝑈𝑈𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟); 𝛽𝛽𝑝𝑝𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑝𝑝 are the preferences for the attributes
to be estimated. Next, individuals’ underlying preferences were estimated for e-cigarettes (𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸)
and the “none of these” option (𝑁𝑁𝑓𝑓𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 − 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 − 𝑈𝑈ℎ𝑐𝑐𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐). The omitted cigarette type is combustible
cigarette, and thus these coefficients show the preference for these options relative to a combustible
cigarette. 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is an error term that is assumed to follow a type-I extreme value distribution to
facilitate estimation.
As noted above, we are interested in the impact of flavored cigarette ban alternatives. Thus,
we redefined the choice model (2) to capture preferences for flavored cigarettes directly, rather
12

than for cigarette types and flavors separately. To do this, we redefined 𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 using (a) flavored
cigarette constant terms (which are combinations of flavors and cigarette type constant terms); and
(b) combined fruit/sweet flavors. 13 We therefore estimate parameters separately for the set of
cigarette type and flavor pairs as indicated below, with tobacco combustible cigarette as the
omitted category. The flavored cigarette type utility function is defined as:
𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 (𝑓𝑓𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑓𝑓 𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐) = 𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗

(3).

+ 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗

The four flavored cigarette constants each represent the preference for a flavored cigarette type
relative to a tobacco flavored combustible cigarette (the omitted category). These constants are:
𝑀𝑀𝑐𝑐𝑛𝑛_𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐, which captures the relative preference for menthol combustible cigarettes, and
𝑇𝑇𝑓𝑓𝑇𝑇_𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐, 𝑀𝑀𝑐𝑐𝑛𝑛_𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐, and 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐𝐹𝐹_𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐𝑈𝑈𝑐𝑐, which capture relative preference for, respectively,
tobacco, menthol, and fruit/sweet flavored e-cigarettes. Further, the preference for not choosing
any of the flavored cigarettes, relative to the omitted tobacco combustible cigarette, was captured
by 𝑁𝑁𝑓𝑓𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐 − 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 − 𝑈𝑈ℎ𝑐𝑐𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐. The terms 𝛽𝛽𝑝𝑝𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑝𝑝 , 𝛽𝛽𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑓𝑓𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑛𝑛𝑝𝑝, and 𝛽𝛽ℎ𝑝𝑝𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑛𝑛ℎ 𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 capture preferences for the
attributes of price, nicotine content, and health risk, respectively.
In specification (3), preferences are estimated at the sample level. In addition to this basic
model, we introduced heterogeneity across personal characteristics. Specifically, we interact
sociodemographic and smoking behavior variables with the flavored cigarette constants in the

13

We combine the categories of sweet and fruit because: together they incorporate many of the flavors of ecigarettes available; historically they have been regulated differentially from menthol; and this is consistent with
previous literature (Bonhomme et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2016; Pepper et al., 2016). We also test for the validity of
pooling them as explained below.

utility function. The full list of items that are interacted with the flavored cigarette constants are
given in Table 3 and results are presented in Table 4, panel B. We used estimates of these
interaction terms to make the policy predictions.
Finally, we define the choice model which gives the probability of choice as a function of the
relative utilities (which are, as above, a function of flavored cigarette and attribute preferences).
Because respondents make two sequential choices without replacement, we use the exploded, or
rank order, logit model (Luce and Suppes, 1965; Yoo and Doiron, 2013),
𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 (𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑛𝑛𝑟𝑟 1,2)
=

.

𝑐𝑐 𝑉𝑉𝑈𝑈𝑗𝑗𝑐𝑐

(4),

∑𝐽𝐽𝑗𝑗=1 𝑐𝑐 𝑉𝑉𝑈𝑈𝑗𝑗𝑐𝑐 ∑𝐽𝐽𝑗𝑗=2 𝑐𝑐 𝑉𝑉𝑈𝑈𝑗𝑗𝑐𝑐

where 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is the probability that individual i ranks cigarette type j first or second in choice scenario
c. The first term is the probability that cigarette type j is ranked first (which is akin to the
multinomial logit model for a single choice). The second term is the probability that cigarette type
j is ranked second when the first choice has been removed from the options.
Policy Predictions
To make policy predictions, we use the flavored cigarette choice model in (4) with
sociodemographic and smoking behavior interactions. The estimated choice model yields the
predicted probability of a participant choosing each cigarette type (or “none of these”) in each
choice scenario; the cigarette type with the highest probability of selection is the model’s
prediction of the individual’s choice. By aggregating these predicted choices across the sample,
we observe the “choice shares” or “market shares” for combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes, and
“none of these” across all choices.

14

To make predictions that correspond to the different policy bans, we first predict the status quo
from the model. We then impose the set of policy scenarios on the model and predict the new
market shares. We base our predictions on coefficients only when they are positive and significant.
This yields behaviorally plausible policy predictions: banning a product the respondent does not
like is unlikely to change behavior, whereas banning a product that is liked is likely to change
behavior.
RESULTS
Model Estimates
Table 4 shows the results from the cigarette choice models— for both the basic model without
interactions and the interacted model. For both models, panel A displays the coefficient values for
variables that are common across the two models, that is, coefficients for flavored cigarette types
and “none of these” as well as the attribute levels: price, nicotine, and health. Tobacco combustible
cigarette is the omitted category. Model diagnostic information is also presented. There are 2,031
individuals, each facing 12 choice scenarios, yielding 24,372 observations (there are of course
48,744 choices analyzed since respondents made two choices per task).
In panel A, the coefficients are the preferences for the cigarette/flavor pairs relative to the
omitted tobacco combustible cigarette. On average, combustible cigarettes are preferred to ecigarettes; specifically, all of the e-cigarette constants are negative (disliked) and significantly so.
Menthol combustible cigarettes appear to be disliked less than the three flavored e-cigarettes. Of
the e-cigarettes, the tobacco flavored is disliked the least, followed by fruit/sweet, followed by
menthol, reflecting a general dislike of flavors. Also, seen in panel A is that smokers are, on
average, averse to higher cigarette prices, prefer healthier outcomes, and prefer a medium level of

15

nicotine. These are seen in the negative and significant coefficients and is consistent with theory
and previous research.
In panel B, the full set of interaction terms introduced to the model from equation (4) are
presented. A likelihood ratio test confirms that this specification is preferred in terms of fit to the
model without these interactions. There is substantial preference heterogeneity across individuals’
characteristics. Specifically, younger adult smokers and recent quitters 14 have preferences for
menthol combustible cigarettes and all flavored e-cigarettes, which is in keeping with the literature
(Carrieri and Jones, 2016; Huang et al., 2016; Hartwell et al., 2016; Pesko et al., 2016; Villanti et
al., 2017). Older adult smokers prefer tobacco flavored combustible cigarettes, which is also
consistent with extant literature (Bonhomme et al., 2016; Harrell et al., 2017). African Americans
like menthol, which is consistent with previous literature (Rock et al., 2010; Giovino et al., 2013).
This preference for menthol is stronger than that for fruit/sweet flavored e-cigarettes (larger
coefficients). Asians have a slight preference for flavored e-cigarettes in general. Those with
higher education prefer menthol combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes of all flavors (Carrieri and
Jones, 2016; Hartwell et al., 2016). Those who report low health prefer menthol combustible
cigarettes.
There is interesting heterogeneity in preferences across smoking status. Those who have
attempted quitting show a preference for e-cigarettes (all flavors), which is in keeping with the use
of e-cigarettes as a cessation aid (Beard et al., 2016; Marti et al., 2016; Hartman-Boyce et al., 2016;
Zhu et al., 2017). They are indifferent between tobacco and menthol combustible cigarettes.
Unsurprisingly, both dual users and vapers (those using only e-cigarettes) show very strong

14

To be precise regarding our sample, we use the terms ‘smokers and recent quitters’, however, to prevent the reader

shorter, though less precise, phrases.

16

preferences for all types of e-cigarette, and vapers prefer e-cigarettes to combustible cigarettes. 15
Lastly, recent quitters display a preference for fruit/sweet flavored e-cigarettes, but not for other
flavored e-cigarettes. Recent quitters have a strong aversion to menthol combustible cigarettes.
As confirmed by a likelihood ratio test, our preferred specification with interactions improves
the fit from the model which has only cigarette type constant terms (“LL (constants only)” in Table
3, panel A; see Greene, 2009). The coefficients in the basic model and the model with
heterogeneity are very similar, which is a sign of reliability.
Testing and Robustness
In addition to the data quality measures described above, statistical testing for model
specification, and correspondence of our findings to the literature, further statistical tests and
empirical robustness analyses were conducted and our findings were confirmed. First, alternative
model structures were estimated, including the multinomial logit based only on respondents’ first
choice and the exploded logit with the adjustment for scaling differences between the first and
second choices (Yoo and Doiron, 2013). We further estimated a model with random parameters to
allow for unobserved heterogeneity. In addition, we estimated a model that discarded the recent
quitters. In all cases, we find the results to be very similar to those presented.
In addition, our specification of the paired flavored cigarettes was tested (rather than flavors
as attributes and cigarette types separately). We use pairwise testing of all flavored cigarette
constants and find that we can reject the null that the two coefficients are equal per pair in every
test (at the one percent level). We observe an improvement in model fit when moving from a model
with flavors as attributes and cigarette types separately to the model in Table 3 (although it is not

15

This can be seen as the positive coefficient for the interaction of vaper and tobacco e-cigarette is greater than the
negative coefficient for tobacco e-cigarettes. Thus, all else equal, tobacco e-cigarettes are preferred to tobacco
combustible cigarettes by vapers. This is also true for fruit/sweet e-cigarettes, but not for menthol.

17

statistically significant). We also test our categories of flavors. In preliminary modeling, we find
no differences between preferences for fruit and sweet flavors. Using a Wald test, we are unable
to reject the null that the two coefficients were equal. In addition, we find that preferences for
fruit/sweet were statistically distinct from menthol. These tests support the categorization of sweet
and fruit together that we use. In summary, our treatment of flavors is in line with policymakers’
options, but also consistent with the literature and is statistically supported.
Several internal validity checks supported our results. First, we used a series of follow-up
questions to check for consistency between choice task responses—e.g. health is self-reported by
our sample as one of the leading reasons for using e-cigarettes. Second, we checked that our
estimated coefficients are in line with theoretical a priori expectations, that is, price coefficients
are negative, respondents preferred healthier cigarettes and that those who report using e-cigarettes
prefer e-cigarettes to combustible cigarettes.
Policy Predictions
Table 5 displays the predicted market shares across the set of flavor bans. For the convenience
of the reader, Table 5, panel A displays the information from Table 1 on the status quo flavor
policy and the set of alternative flavor bans. Panel B presents predictions of the impact of these
flavor bans on cigarette type choice shares. Panel C displays the percentage change in the choice
shares between the current policy and each of the proposed policies; these are calculated directly
from panel B.
Policymakers can use these predictions to design optimal flavor bans based on their policy
goals. However, the optimal policy also depends on the policymaker’s view of e-cigarettes as a
harm reduction device and how this view defines their objective. We see two likely goals: 1) to
minimize the selection of combustible cigarettes, as they are arguably the most dangerous, and 2)
18

to maximize the choice of abstaining, which we proxy with “none of these.” For using either of
these goals as selection criterion, the table provides the needed information.
The predicted shares of cigarette type choices under the current set of flavor bans are, as seen
in the first row of panel B of Table 5: 45.2 percent for combustible cigarettes, 37.5 percent for ecigarettes, and 17.2 percent for “none of these.” Note that these choice shares are roughly in line
with the reported smoking statuses in Table 3. Exact matches would not be expected since we are
experimentally varying products’ attributes, respondents are making two discrete choices, and the
smoking categories are not perfectly comparable across the two measures. But the similarity is
nonetheless encouraging.
The results from panel B of Table 5 indicate that policymakers seeking to minimize the use of
combustible cigarettes should ban only menthol (policy alternative 3). This results in the lowest
choice of combustible cigarettes—at 40.0 percent—across the policy options, which represents a
5.2 percent reduction in the percentage of choices that are combustible cigarettes (panel C). Of this
reduction, the majority goes to e-cigarettes at 3.8 percent, with the remaining choices being “none
of these" at 1.6 percent.
Policymakers seeking to minimize the use of all cigarette types should ban all flavors in both
cigarette types (policy Alternative 1). In Alternative 1, as seen in panel B, 22.4 percent of the
choices would be “none of these”; this is the highest choice of “none of these.” Those who prefer
e-cigarettes for their flavors are predicted to change their choice of cigarette type (or choose none)
when these flavors are banned. Specifically, as seen in panel C, e-cigarette choice declines by 7.9
percent; instead, people increase their choice of combustible cigarettes by 2.7 percent and “none
of these” by 5.2 percent. Thus, when denied their first choice of flavored e-cigarettes, they select

19

their next preferred alternatives, with some choosing combustible cigarettes and almost twice as
many choosing “none of these.”
Importantly, Table 5 indicates that the recent comprehensive e-cigarette flavor ban proposed
by the FDA would not maximize either of the above goals. Although the comprehensive ban would
result in the second-largest reduction in selecting either cigarette type, as seen in panel B (20.2
percent of the choices would be “none of these”), the selection of combustible cigarettes would
increase from 45.2 percent to 53.4 percent (see panel B). Unfortunately, as seen in panel C, 8.3
percent would change from e-cigarettes to combustible cigarettes—the most dangerous type—and
only around 3.0 percent would choose “none of these.” Thus, this policy would likely drive current
e-cigarette users toward cigarettes more than toward abstinence.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Flavor bans for e-cigarettes and menthol in combustibles are pressing policy issues that have
received relatively little empirical study. Now that the FDA has the power to regulate flavors in
both combustible and e-cigarettes, it has again been considering flavor bans for all types of
cigarettes (FDA, 2017). Thus, there is an urgent need for an analysis of the impact of flavor bans
on public health. Despite the need for this information, there are no studies predicting the impacts
of alternative bans on the use of combustibles, e-cigarettes, and neither. We provide such
information for adult smokers and recent quitters using a DCE and a large, nationally
representative survey.
Findings
We find that flavors themselves serve as an attribute that drives choices across combustibles
and e-cigarettes and choosing none. We conclude that flavor bans can be effective levers that affect
smokers’ choices. Alternative flavor bans can either enhance protection of the health of the public
20

or worsen it. Specifically, our results indicate that banning flavors in e-cigarettes, while allowing
them to remain in combustibles, would result in the greatest increase in smoking of combustible
cigarettes; and the use of e-cigarettes would decline (10.3 percent).
By comparison, we find that a ban on menthol combustible cigarettes would produce the
greatest reduction (4.8 percent) in the use of combustible cigarettes across the flavor bans that we
study. Much of this movement from combustible cigarettes would be to e-cigarettes (3.5 percent)
and the remainder would be toward “none” (1.3 percent). Given that combustible cigarettes impose
the most significant harms on those who smoke them, reducing the smoking rate would likely
increase the health of the public. Our results suggest that policymakers need to consider
simultaneously the impact of flavor policies on combustibles, e-cigarettes, and abstinence.
Strengths and Limitations
We add to the literature in several ways including using robust methods to address timely
policy questions empirically that have not been fully studied. Specifically, we make needed
predictions about a wide set of flavors across e-cigarettes and combustibles. Use of the DCE
approach is one of the few ways that allows for examination of the set of counterfactual flavor
policies. We collected our own data from a nationally representative sample comprising current
and former smokers. Using these data, we present the only available estimates of alternative flavors
bans across both combustible and e-cigarettes for the U.S. In addition, we present what we believe
are the first estimates of how preferences for flavored cigarettes vary across individual
characteristics; furthermore, because we estimate the effects within a single sample using the same
methods, our comparisons across groups are more comparable and consistent than what could be
gleaned from multiple studies. In addition, we have conducted our experiment in line with best

21

practice (Johnson et al., 2013), found evidence of internal and external validity of the results, and
applied a broad range of robustness checks and sensitivity analyses.
Despite the above strengths, our study has several limitations. First, DCEs rely on hypothetical
choice: we observe stated choices and not real-world behaviors. Thus, there is a risk of hypothetical
bias (Harrison, 2014). To help address this concern, our sample includes current and recent
smokers, individuals who have made such real-world decisions. In addition, DCEs tend to perform
well when the range of options is small and familiar to the respondents (McFadden, 2014), which
is the case here since all respondents are current or recent smokers. A second limitation is that,
while the demographics of our sample are nationally representative, smokers in our sample smoke
slightly more heavily than the U.S. average. Third, while the impact on adult smokers and recent
quitters is an important consideration, our results are pertinent only to these groups. Youth
smoking decisions should be examined separately, but that was beyond the scope of this study.
Fourth, the meaning of the “none of these” option is somewhat ambiguous. Lastly, we do not
observe whether smokers alter their consumption quantity depending on the product selected; for
example, in changing to e-cigarettes, smokers may decide to smoke more or less heavily.
Policy
Our results have important policy implications for flavor bans. According to our predictions, a
ban on flavored e-cigarettes would drive smokers to combustible cigarettes, which have been
found to be the more harmful way of getting nicotine (Goniewicz et al., 2017; Shahab et al., 2017).
In addition, such a ban reduces the appeal of e-cigarettes to those who are seeking to quit; ecigarettes have proven useful as a cessation device for these individuals (Hartmann-Boyce et al.,
2016; Zhu et al., 2017), and we find that quitters have a preference for flavored e-cigarettes.

22

However, these results refer to adult smokers and recent quitters, not those under age 18. With
36.5 million adult smokers in the U.S., policy that protects the health of those over 18 is critical.
To best apply our findings to protect public health, policymakers should determine their stance
on the potential health impacts of e-cigarettes. Specifically, is their main aim to encourage smokers
of combustible cigarettes to switch to e-cigarettes to reduce the harms to their health? Or is the
primary aim to reduce the use of either type of cigarettes? Given the goals of regulators, our
predictions provide information that is not otherwise available but is needed by policymakers. This
information is timely, given that cities and counties are adopting flavor ban policies and that the
FDA has been actively considering bans on both e-cigarettes and menthol in combustible
cigarettes. Our results have some perhaps surprising implications that could prove valuable to
lawmakers and regulators in crafting the best policies for public health.

Notes: Each row corresponds to a policy scenario; these are defined also in Table 1. Panel A, “Permitted flavors by cigarette type”,
shows the availability of menthol and fruit/sweet flavors for combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes: “Allowed” or “Allow” shows when
the flavor is permitted, “Banned” or “Ban” shows when the flavor is banned. Panel B, “Cigarette type choice shares”, shows the
percentage of predicted choices for each product. Panel C, “Change in choice shares”, shows the percentage change in predicted choices
from the current US policy to the policy scenario, which is the difference between the current policy and the predicted policy share(s).
a
denotes the policy with the largest predicted reduction in combustible cigarette choice; b denotes the policy with the largest increase in
the “None of these” option. There may be error from rounding in the estimates.
