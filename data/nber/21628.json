    "abstract": "\n\nWe develop a simple algorithm for detecting exam cheating between students who copy off one another\u2019s exam.  When this algorithm is applied to exams in a general science course at a top university, we find strong evidence of cheating by at least 10 percent of the students.  Students studying together cannot explain our findings.  Matching incorrect answers prove to be a stronger indicator of cheating than matching correct answers.  When seating locations are randomly assigned, and monitoring is increased, cheating virtually disappears.\n\n",
