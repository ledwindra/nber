Variations in the labor market assimilation of immigrants according to their gender and country of origin are also analyzed.  The results suggest that recent immigrant cohorts have had more difficulty being assimilated into the Canadian labor market than earlier ones, an apparent consequence of recent changes in Canadian immigration policy, labor market discrimination against visible minorities, and the prolonged recession of the early 1980s.\n\n",
