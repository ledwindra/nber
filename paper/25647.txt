Do Minimum Wage Increases Reduce Crime?

NBER Working Paper No. 25647
March 2019, Revised October 2020
JEL No. J01,J3
ABSTRACT
An April 2016 Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) report advocated raising the minimum wage
to deter crime. This recommendation rests on the assumption that minimum wage hikes increase
the returns to legitimate labor market work while generating minimal adverse employment
effects. This study comprehensively assesses the impact of minimum wages on arrests using data
from the 1998-2016 Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) and the 1998-2016 waves of the National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97). In contrast to the CEA claim, our results provide
no evidence that minimum wage increases reduce arrests. Instead, we find that raising the
minimum wage increases property crime arrests among 16-to-24-year-olds, with an estimated
elasticity of approximately 0.2. This result persists when we use longitudinal data to isolate
workers for whom minimum wages bind. Auxiliary analyses using the Current Population Survey
(CPS) suggest that our findings are likely driven by adverse labor demand effects of the minimum
wage. Our estimates suggest that a $15 Federal minimum wage could generate criminal
externality costs of nearly $2.5 billion.

1. Introduction
“Raising the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour could prevent as many as half a million crimes
annually, according to a new report from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers…as
fewer people would be forced to turn to illegal activity to make ends meet.”
-Washington Post, April 25, 2016

Increasing incarceration and police can be effective (Levitt 2004; Corman and Mocan
2005; Chalfin and McCrary 2018), but expensive (Kearney et al. 2014) policy strategies to fight
crime. Expenditures on police and the criminal justice system are estimated to be on the order of
$296 billion per year (Bureau of Justice Statistics 2019).1 An alternative set of policies to deter
crime, which are often less costly to taxpayers, includes those that improve labor market
conditions and incentivize greater human capital acquisition. Among those at the margin of
crime commission, criminal behavior is negatively related to employment opportunities (Mustard
2010; Schnepel 2018), wages (Gould et al. 2002; Yang 2017), and educational attainment
(Machin and Meghir 2004; Anderson 2014). An April 2016 report from the White House
Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) contrasted the high public costs of deterring crime via the
criminal justice system with lower cost alternatives and recommended a novel policy strategy for
combating crime: raising the minimum wage.
The CEA argued that because minimum wage increases raise the hourly wages of lowskilled workers, the opportunity cost of engaging in criminal activity will rise, resulting in less
crime. Using estimates of the crime elasticity with respect to wages from Gould et al. (2002), the
CEA concluded that raising the Federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $12 per hour would
decrease crime by 3 to 5 percent, or 250,000 to 510,000 crimes annually (CEA 2016), resulting
in $8 to $17 billion dollars per year in cost savings (CEA 2016). Consistent with the CEA’s
prediction, recent work by Agan and Makowsky (2020) finds that minimum wage increases are
negatively related to criminal recidivism.

The $296 billion estimate is comprised of $142 billion for police, $88 billion for corrections (e.g. prisons, jails, and
staffing), and $65 billion for the judicial system (Bureau of Justice Statistics 2019). Additionally, the FBI estimates
that in 2016, the victims of property crime (excluding arson) suffered losses of $15.6 billion (FBI 2017c).
1

While intriguing, the CEA’s policy conclusion rests on the assumption that (i) minimum
wage increases do not cause adverse labor demand effects that lead to more crime, or (ii) any
adverse labor demand effects are sufficiently small to be swamped by wage gains (Agan and
Makowsky 2020) or by enhanced expectations for higher-paying jobs. But there are important
reasons to expect that the adverse labor demand effects from minimum wages may not always be
small (Neumark 2018; Clemens and Wither 2019; Gittings and Schmutte 2016; Powell 2016;
Baksaya and Rubenstein 2015; Sabia et al. 2012; 2016; Churchill and Sabia 2019). Minimum
wage-induced job loss or hours reductions may lead to more property crime for economic
reasons (Grogger 1998; Mustard 2010) and more violent crime for despair-related, emotionally
expressive reasons (Wang et al. 2010; Nordin and Almen 2017).2 Minimum wage increases
could also affect crime through their human capital effects, including impacts on school
enrollment (Neumark and Wascher 2003; Pacheco and Cruickshank 2007) and on-the-job
training (Neumark and Wascher 2001; Acemoglu and Pischke 2003). Additionally, they may
also affect crime via their impacts on expected labor market opportunities, conditional on actual
opportunities (Galbiati et al. Forthcoming). The net effect of minimum wages on crime depends
on (i) the magnitudes of wage, employment, schooling, and on-the-job training elasticities with
respect to the minimum wage, (ii) the magnitudes of crime elasticities with respect to wages,
employment, schooling, and on-the-job training, (iii) the distribution of labor market effects of
the minimum wage across individuals with heterogeneous propensities for crime, and (iv) on
how higher minimum wages impact future expectations of labor market opportunities.
The current study assesses the credibility of the CEA claim by comprehensively
examining the relationship between minimum wages and crime. Using data from the 1998-2016
Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) and the 1998-2016 waves of the National Longitudinal Study of
Youth 1997 (NLSY97), difference-in-differences estimates provide little evidence of crimereducing effects of the minimum wage. Instead, we find robust evidence that minimum wage
hikes increase property crime arrests among teenagers and young adults ages 16-to-24, a
population for whom minimum wages are likely to bind (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2017). We
2

Wang et al. (2010) find that male ex-offenders in Florida released into counties with higher levels of
unemployment are more likely to commit violent crime, which the authors suggest may be due to despair created by
the lack of employment opportunities. They suggest this may also lead to male ex-offenders seeking alternative
ways to express their masculinity (through violent crime, as opposed to employment). Nordin and Almen (2017)
find that long-term unemployment spells are associated with increases in violent crime, which they suggest may be
due to the strain created by these spells resulting in violent behavior.

estimate a property arrest elasticity with respect to the minimum wage of 0.2. This result is
consistent with adverse labor demand effects of the minimum wage, a result that we confirm
using data from Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Groups (CPS-ORG). Our
confidence in the common trends assumption underlying our identification strategy is bolstered
by event-study analyses.
Furthermore, we find little evidence that minimum wage increases affect arrests for
violent offenses, or net crime among older individuals, but do increase delinquency-related
crimes related to teenage idleness (Jacob and Lefgren 2003; Luallen 2006; Anderson 2014). In
contrast to Agan and Makowsky (2020), we find no evidence that increases in the minimum
wage reduce net crime among working-age individuals, suggesting that different margins of
criminal behavior may be differentially affected by minimum wages.
Finally, estimates of the effect of the minimum wage on “treated workers” in the
NLSY97, those workers earning wages such that they are affected by minimum wage increases,
add to our confidence in interpreting our UCR-based findings causally. Our findings in
individual-level panel data suggest that minimum wages increase the probability of property
crime commission among those bound by such hikes.
To put our findings in the context of the 2016 CEA report, increasing the Federal
minimum wage to $12 would represent a 66 percent increase in the current Federal minimum
wage. Lower bound intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates from the UCR suggest that a $12 minimum
wage would result in approximately 231,000 additional property crimes, generating annual
criminal externality costs of $1.4 billion (in 2019$) (McCollister et al. 2010). Moreover, the
Raise the Wage Act of 2019 (HR 582), endorsed by Democratic Presidential Candidate Joe
Biden, would raise the Federal minimum wage by 107 percent to $15 per hour.3 Our estimates
suggest that this minimum wage hike would generate approximately 423,000 additional property
crimes and $2.5 billion per year in additional crime costs. We conclude that increasing the

House Resolution (HR) 582 was introduced by Congressman Bobby Scott (D-VA) on January 16, 2019 and
endorsed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). HR 582 passed the House on 7/18/2019 and is currently on the
Senate calendar as General Order No. 156. The resolution proposes a seven-step (over seven years) increase in the
Federal minimum wage until it reaches $15 per hour, in which subsequent increases are indexed to median wage
growth. The resolution also proposes increases in the tipped minimum wage (topping out at $14.10 per hour, and
indexed to median wage growth thereafter). Legislative updates on HR 582 can be found at the following link:

minimum wage will at best be ineffective at deterring crime and at worst will have unintended
consequences that increase property crime among young adults.

2. Background
2.1 Crime, the Labor Market, and Human Capital
Becker’s theory of rational crime (1968) posits that criminal behavior is responsive to
labor market conditions and human capital acquisition, and there is strong empirical evidence to
support this theory. First, studies that have exploited changes in local employment conditions for
populations on the margin of criminal behavior find that crime is positively related to
unemployment rates (Raphael and Winter-Ebmer 2001; Gould et al. 2002; Machin and Meghir
2004; Levitt 2004; Oster and Agell 2007; Lin 2008; Mustard 2010) and business cycle
contractions (Arvanites and Defina 2006; Rosenfeld and Fornango 2007). Recidivism also
decreases when low-skilled job opportunities in construction and manufacturing rise (sectors
more willing to hire ex-offenders) in the communities to which ex-offenders are released
(Schnepel 2018). In addition, there is strong evidence that criminal behavior responds to wages.
Gould et al. (2002) find that a 10 percent increase in the wages of non-college-educated men is
associated with a 5.4 percent decrease in property crime and a 10.8 percent decrease in violent
crime.4 Along the same lines, Yang (2017) finds that ex-offenders released in counties with
higher low-skilled wages are less likely to recidivate, particularly in sectors more willing to hire
ex-offenders.
Second, increases in educational attainment may reduce crime. Raising the minimum
legal school dropout age leads to a decline in criminal behavior among affected students
(Lochner and Moretti 2004; Machin et al. 2011; Anderson 2014). These schooling effects can be
explained by incapacitation effects (Jacob and Lefgren 2003; Luallen 2006) as well as enhanced
human capital acquisition (Lochner and Moretti 2004; Machin et al. 2011), the latter of which
may change both the opportunity costs of crime as well as the tastes for crime.5

4

They also find that a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate for non-college-educated working
males ages 18 to 65 is associated with a 2.3 percent increase in property crime and a 1.3 percent increase in violent
crime.
5

Anderson (2014) finds little evidence of displacement effects of crime in schools.
4

Crime-reducing effects of human capital acquisition can also be attained through on-thejob training (Lochner 2004), which is expected to increase workers’ wages (Mincer 1962; Brown
1989). On-the-job training has an important impact on the wages of young adult workers
without a college degree (Lynch 1992).

2.2 Effect of Minimum Wages on Labor Market Outcomes
Minimum wages may affect each of the labor market outcomes described in Section 2.1,
thereby impacting crime. First, there is strong and uncontroversial evidence that minimum wage
increases raise the wages of low-skilled teenage and young adult workers (Card and Krueger
1994; Neumark and Wascher 2008; Dube et al. 2010; Allegretto et al. 2011; Sabia et al. 2012;
Belman and Wolfson 2014; Neumark et. al. 2014a,b). Estimated wage elasticities from this
literature are around 0.1 to 0.3.6
In contrast, the literature on the employment effects of U.S. minimum wages is far more
controversial. Quasi-experimental studies have taken a number of approaches to identify
employment effects, including methods that exploit, (i) temporal variation across jurisdictions in
minimum wage levels (Cengiz et al. 2019; Neumark et al. 2014a,b)7, (ii) heterogeneity in
bindingness of minimum wage increases across jurisdictions with heterogeneous pre-treatment
shares of low-wage workers (Stewart 2004; Thompson 2009), and (iii) jurisdiction-level
differences in bindingness of a Federal minimum wage change due to pre-treatment differences
in minimum wage levels (Clemens and Wither 2019; Currie and Fallick 1996). In addition,
recent work has attempted to overcome the endogeneity of minimum wages by randomly
assigning minimum wages to firms that post job openings online (Horton 2018).
The debate on the minimum wage’s employment effects is unlikely to be settled for some
time, owed, in part, to disagreements about the appropriateness of “close controls” (Dube et al.
2010; Neumark et al. 2014a) and whether partialling out geographic-specific time trends reduces
or exacerbates bias in estimates of the minimum wage’s employment effects (Allegretto et al.

These estimated wage elasticities are “intent-to-treat” estimates that are often far less than one, often closer to 0.1
to 0.2. This is because not all low-skilled workers earn wages such that they are affected by minimum wage
increases and those that are may earn a wage between the old and new minimum wage.

2011; Neumark et al. 2014a). Moreover, differences in studies’ findings may be explained by
heterogeneous treatment effects of the minimum wage across low-skilled sub-groups (withinand across-industries), jurisdictions, and time periods (Neumark 2019). If there are adverse
employment and hours effects of the minimum wage, they are likely concentrated among the
least-experienced low-wage workers. In summary, Neumark (2019) concludes that “the
preponderance of evidence indicates that minimum wages reduce employment of the leastskilled workers” and suggests that “there is a great deal of uncertainty about the employment
effects of a $15 minimum wage” (pp. 323-324).8
Minimum Wages and Human Capital Acquisition. Raising the minimum wage may also
affect crime via its effects on schooling and job training. Evidence on the schooling effects of
minimum wages are somewhat mixed. Early studies find heterogeneity in schooling effects
across income groups, reducing enrollment for teenagers in low-income families while
increasing enrollment for those in high-income families (Ehrenberg and Marcus 1980; 1982).
More recent studies find adverse school enrollment effects of minimum wages (Neumark and
Wascher 2003; Pacheco and Cruickshank 2007) and little impacts on overall educational
attainment (Card 1992; Campolieti et al. 2005; Warren and Hammock 2010; Sabia 2012).9
There is stronger evidence that minimum wages reduce on-the-job training (Neumark and
Wascher 2001; Acemoglu and Pischke 2003), a finding consistent with the hypothesis that wage

8

While most studies have focused on the effects of state and Federal minimum wage changes, others have examined
the effects of local minimum and living wages on labor market outcomes, with mixed results. In a study of Seattle’s
minimum wage, Jardim et al. (2018) find that the increase from $11 to $13 per hour resulted in a 3.2 percent
increase in wages of low-skilled workers, but a 6.9 percent decrease in hours worked and 5.9 percent decrease in
employment (see Tables 5 and 6 in Jardim et al. 2018). In contrast, studies of local minimum wages in San
Francisco (Schmitt and Rosnick 2011), Santa Fe (Schmitt and Rosnick 2011), and San Jose (Allegretto and Reich
2018) find evidence of minimum wage-induced wage gains, but no adverse employment effects; whereas, Luca and
Luca (2019) find that the minimum wage increases in the San Francisco Bay Area were associated with restaurant
closures. For living wages, studies find increases in wages (Neumark and Adams 2003a,b; 2005b; Brenner 2005;
Fairris 2005; Reich et al. 2005; Neumark et al. 2012), yet there is also evidence of adverse employment effects
(Neumark and Adams 2003a,b; 2005b; Fairris 2005; Neumark et al. 2012). Furthermore, Neumark and Adams
(2003a) find that living wages which cover businesses receiving financial assistance bind the most for low-wage
workers (compared to living wages covering other forms of employment: municipal employees, public contract
workers, or hotel workers), with Neumark and Adams (2005a) finding that living wages covering these businesses
generate larger wage increases and employment reductions.
9

Warren and Hamrock (2010) find some modest evidence that larger minimum wage increases may have small
negative effects on high school completion rates in states where students are permitted to drop out before age 17.

floors reduce an employer’s flexibility to finance job training out of workers’ wages (Rosen
1972).

2.3 Minimum Wages and Crime
The literature on the crime effects of minimum wages is recent and small and was
unmentioned in the April 2016 CEA report. Estimates obtained in this literature are sensitive to
the (i) low-skilled population, (ii) time period, and (iii) margin of criminal behavior examined.10
Hansen and Machin (2002) examine the introduction of a new national minimum wage
law in the United Kingdom and find that crime declines more in localities with larger shares of
low-wage workers. Fernandez et al. (2014) use a clever identification strategy to estimate the
effect of living wage ordinances enacted between 1990 and 2010 on overall crime rates for 239
large U.S. cities. They identify “control” cities as those that narrowly defeated living wage
ordinances or passed such ordinances, but had them enjoined or repealed by state courts, and find
that living wage increases are associated with reductions in both property and violent crimes.
Although not emphasized in their paper, Fernandez et al. (2014) also find that minimum wage
increases are associated with reductions in property and violent crimes, though these associations
are sensitive to the inclusion of observable controls and city-specific time trends. In contrast,
Beauchamp and Chan (2014) use individual-level panel data over a comparable period, and
focusing on low-wage workers for whom minimum wages are more likely to bind, find that
increases in the minimum wage increase property and violent crimes among teenagers, but often
find the opposite effect for young adults.
Finally, a new working paper by Agan and Makowsky (2020) explores the impact of
minimum wage increases on recidivism. They examine nearly six million prison releases (four
million unique offenders) across 43 states from 2000 to 2014 and find that minimum wage
increases are associated with a decline in recidivism, primarily through reduced property and

10

Most studies in this small literature have used a difference-in-differences identification strategy that exploits
variation in minimum wages across jurisdictions and over time. There are exceptions to this approach. For instance,
Hashimoto (1987) uses national data between 1947 and 1982 to estimate a time series regression and finds that
Federal minimum wage increases are positively related to property crimes for youths ages 15-to-19, with estimated
elasticities of 0.1 to 0.5.

drug crime.11 The authors posit that (i) wage gains from minimum wage increases may dominate
any negative employment effects, and (ii) some ex-offenders may see increases in employment
following minimum wage increases if employers respond to minimum wage hikes by
substituting away from less experienced workers and toward more experienced workers with a
felony record. Their implied property and drug crime elasticities are quite large, ranging from 0.451 to -0.553, which would suggest that large shares of ex-offenders are affected by minimum
wage increases or, perhaps, that media coverage about minimum wage hikes substantially
changed ex-offenders’ expectations about higher-paying jobs in the future (Galbiati et al.
Forthcoming).12
We contribute to this literature by using two large national datasets over a two-decade
period to comprehensively examine the impact of Federal, state, and local minimum wages on
crime. In contrast with many prior papers, our study (i) focuses on younger, lower-skilled
individuals for whom minimum wages are most likely to bind (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2017)
and are more prone to crime (FBI 2017a), (ii) explicitly examines employment, hours, and
human capital effects of minimum wages over the same time period (and occasionally for the
same people for whom) we measure crime, (iii) explores the sensitivity of our findings to tests of
the common trends assumption, including event studies, controls for jurisdiction-level time
trends, and pseudo-falsification tests on demographic groups that should be less affected by
minimum wages, and (iv) examines overall crime rates that include first-time arrests as well as
criminal arrests that do not result in incarceration and release. Finally, we attempt to understand
and reconcile sometimes conflicting results across the existing small minimum wage-crime
literature.

11

In addition, they find that expansions in the state Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) reduces recidivism among
women, consistent with the EITC increasing returns to legitimate employment. The authors posit that this result is
driven by eligibility rules that make the EITC bind most strongly for custodial parents.
12

Estimated intent to treat estimates of wage elasticities with respect to the minimum wage for low-wage workers
tend to range from 0.1 to 0.3 (Card and Krueger 1994; Neumark and Wascher 2008; Dube et al. 2010; Allegretto et
al. 2011; Sabia et al. 2012; Belman and Wolfson 2014; Neumark et. al. 2014a,b; Jardim et al. 2018).

3. Data and Methods
3.1 Data
The primary data source for our crime analysis is the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR),
supplemented by data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97). Each
dataset has advantages and disadvantages, which we discuss below.13
From the UCR, we generate county-by-year criminal arrest rates from 1998 to 2016 by
the age of the offender. Our primary “treatment group” is comprised of teenagers and young
adults ages 16-to-24, an age cohort for whom minimum wages are most likely to bind (Bureau of
Labor Statistics 2017). Arrest data are collected for property crimes (larceny, burglary, motor
vehicle theft, and arson), violent crimes (homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault), and
other minor crimes often linked to idleness and delinquency (vandalism, liquor law violations,
drunkenness, disorderly conduct, and drug crimes). To assure data quality, we drop county-year
arrest rates that are greater than two standard deviations from the county arrest rate mean, control
for the number of agencies that report to a county each year, and limit our sample to counties
where at least 65 percent of agencies report arrest data (see, for example, Anderson 2014).14
Alternate methods of ensuring consistent reporting, including requiring a balanced panel of
agencies, generated a similar pattern of results.
Means of county-level arrests per 1,000 population are reported in Table 1. The average
property crime arrest rate among 16-to-24 year-olds over the sample period is 15.83 per 1,000.

13

The UCR data used in this study are the Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race files (United States 2016). These data can
be downloaded from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR):
https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACJD/series/57?start=0&sort=TITLE_SORT%2520asc&SERIESQ=57&ARC
HIVE=NACJD&PUBLISH_STATUS=PUBLISHED&rows=50
14

Explicitly, we utilize the “coverage indicator” sample criterion:
n
Agency Populationit
12 − Months Reportedit
Coverage Indicatorct = (1 − ∑ {[
]∗[
]}) ∗ 100
County Populationct
12
i=1

Where c denotes county, i denotes agency, and t denotes year. For a county with all agencies reporting 12 months of
arrest data, the coverage indicator takes on the value of 100. For a county with none of the agencies reporting arrest
data for any month, the coverage indicator takes on the value of zero. The coverage indicator measure was
developed by the ICPSR (US DOJ 2017), and has been used by researchers as a sample criterion to assure data
quality (see Freedman and Owens 2011; Thomas and Shihadeh 2013). Alternate cutoffs of the percentage of
agencies reporting within the county (e.g. 60 percent, 75 percent, or 90 percent) generate a similar pattern of results.

9

For violent crime arrests, the mean is 5.04 per 1,000. As expected, arrest rates decline by age
and are larger for men than women (see Appendix Table 1A).15, 16
We add to the above analysis by using individual-level panel data from the National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) from 1998 through 2016. A key advantage of
these longitudinal data is that we can identify low-wage workers who earn wages such that they
are affected by future minimum wage increases. Thus, while the UCR-based analysis will permit
us to identify intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates, the NLSY97 will permit estimates of the effect of
treatment-on-the-treated (TOT). Moreover, the NLSY data permit us to measure crime that does
not necessarily result in arrest, as well as jointly model labor market outcomes and criminal
behavior.17 While Current Population Survey data permits us to examine net labor demand
effects over the same period during which we measure crime, the NLSY97 actually permits us to
examine crime and employment effects for the same persons.
Despite these advantages, the NLSY97 data have a number of limitations. Data collected
as part of the NLSY97 survey are self-reported and hence the crime variables are likely to
understate the true prevalence of crime. However, as long as such measurement error is
orthogonal to minimum wage changes, estimated policy impacts in terms of percent changes
(relative to mean reporting crime) should be unbiased. Second, as the original sample consists of
8,983 respondents, the sample is not designed to be representative of low wage workers at the
jurisdiction-by-year level.18 Often, there are very small numbers of low wage workers bound by

15

Appendix Table 1B shows mean arrest rates for specific property, violent, and minor crimes in the UCR.

16

To supplement crime data from the UCR, we draw data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System
(NIBRS) from 1998 through 2016. A key advantage of these data is that we can measure race/ethnicity-specific
criminal incidents for 16-to-24 year-old arrestees, which is not possible with the UCR. This may be important if
there are heterogeneous impacts of minimum wages by race or ethnicity. However, external validity using the
NIBRS is limited. As of 2016, 38 states and the District of Columbia reported to the NIBRS (FBI 2017b), which
represents 37.1 percent of the coverage in the UCR program (FBI 2017a) and smaller, more rural jurisdictions, are
overrepresented (McCormack et al. 2017). Thus, if there are heterogeneous impacts of minimum wages by
jurisdiction location and size, this could explain differences in results across the UCR and NIBRS.

These data also permit us to control for individual fixed effects to more effectively disentangle the effects of local
minimum wages from difficult-to-measure time-invariant individual characteristics and examine person-specific
changes in minimum wages, employment, and crime. In supplemental analysis, we take this tack, though results are
somewhat less precisely estimated.
18

Moreover, the NLSY97 ceased asking crime questions to all the respondents starting in round 8 of the survey
(2004), asking crime questions only to individuals who had reported being arrested at least once beginning 2004 in
addition to about 10 percent of survey participants as a control group.

minimum wage increases, which might suggest that estimates may be imprecise and sensitive to
model specification. Thus, estimates obtained from the NLSY97 should be treated as suggestive
as opposed to being conclusive.
Our primary sample consists of approximately 38,000 person-years for individuals ages
16-to-24 for whom self-reported criminal engagement information is available. We generate five
measures of crime using responses to seven questionnaire items. 19 Any Crime is set equal to 1 if
a survey participant reported committed a drug crime, a property crime (theft, damaging
property, other property crime), or a violent crime (assault) since the date of the last interview,
and is set equal to 0 otherwise; Property Crime is set equal to 1 for individuals who reported they
had committed a theft or a property crime, or had damaged others’ property since the date of the
last interview, and is set equal to 0 otherwise; Violent Crime is set equal to 1 for individuals who
reported committing assault since the date of the last interview, and is set equal to 0 otherwise,

19

The following are the survey questions used for the NLSY crime questions. For each survey question, the possible
answers are “Yes” and “No.”
Property Crime Items:
“Since the last interview on, have you stolen something from a store or something that did not belong to
you worth less than 50 dollars?
“Since the last interview on, have you stolen something from a store, person or house, or something that did
not belong to you worth 50 dollars or more including stealing a car?”
“Since the last interview on, have you purposely damaged or destroyed property that did not belong to
you?”
“Since the last interview on [date of last interview], have you committed other property crimes such as
fencing, receiving, possessing or selling stolen property, or cheated someone by selling them something
that was worthless or worth much less than what you said it was?”
Violent Crime Item:
“Since the last interview on, have you attacked someone with the idea of seriously hurting them or have
had a situation end up in a serious fight or assault of some kind?”
Drug Crime Item:
“Since the last interview on, have you sold or helped to sell marijuana (pot, grass), hashish (hash) or other
hard drugs such as heroin, cocaine or LSD?”
Arrest Item:
“Since the date of last interview on, have you been arrested by the police or taken into custody for an illegal
or delinquent offense (do not include arrests for minor traffic violations)?”
11

Drug Crime is set equal to 1 for individuals who reported selling drugs and is set equal to 0
otherwise; and Arrest, set equal to 1 if respondents had been arrested and 0 otherwise.20
Appendix Table 2 shows means of these crime outcomes from the NLSY.

3.2 Minimum Wages and Living Wages
Our main policy variable of interest for the UCR-based analysis is the higher of the
Federal, state, or local minimum wage, MW. Federal and state-level minimum wages are
collected from the United States Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division. For county and
city-level minimum wages, we use data compiled by Vaghul and Zipperer (2016) and update
these data through 2016 via our own searches of local minimum wage ordinances. In addition,
we measure living wage ordinances using effective dates compiled from the National
Employment Law Project (2011) as well as our own individual contacts with local governments.
During the period from 1998 to 2016, there were 3 Federal minimum wage increases, 217
state minimum wage increases, 77 local minimum wage increases, and 116 living wage
ordinances enacted. Figure 1 shows county-level variation in minimum wages over the period
under study. The average state-legislated minimum wage hike over the 1998-2016 period was
$0.55 (in 2016$) and 12 states indexed their minimum wages to inflation.
For the NLSY97-based analysis, our key treatment variable differs as we identify a
treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) estimate. Following Currie and Fallick (1996), we define
Binding MW as an indicator set equal to 1 if an individual is employed and earns a wage at year t
that was no lower than the state or local minimum wage at year t and no higher than the state or
local minimum wage at year t+1, and set equal to 0 if a worker earned a wage higher than the
minimum wage at year t+1 or lower than the minimum wage at year t (i.e. because he or she was
a tipped or informal worker not bound by the minimum wage). Thus, by construction, our
estimation sample is limited to those who were employed in year t.
Given that wage spillovers are possible to those who earn wages at year t higher than the
minimum wage at t+1 if firms engage in labor-labor substitution (or treat such laborers as
complements), we experiment with dropping workers who earn hourly wages that are higher

20

Following Beauchamp and Chan (2014), we assume that the absence of response is because of inactivity. Thus,
we replace missing values for crime variables to zero for those who ever reported criminal behavior. Estimates
without replacing missing crime variable observations produce similar results to those presented here.
12

than, but are within $1 or $2 of the next period’s minimum wage. We also experiment with
dropping sub-minimum wage workers (e.g. informal workers or tipped employees) from the
analysis sample. The results were qualitatively similar to those presented below.21

3.3 Empirical Methods
We begin with data from the 1998-2016 UCR and estimate the following two-way fixed
effects model via ordinary least squares (OLS):
𝑌𝑐𝑠𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑙𝑛 (𝑀𝑊𝑐𝑠𝑡 ) + 𝑋𝑐𝑠𝑡 ′𝛼 + 𝐸𝑠𝑡 ′𝜑 + 𝐶𝑠𝑡 ′𝜃 + 𝑃𝑠𝑡 ′𝜔 + 𝜏𝑡 + 𝛿𝑐 + 𝜀𝑐𝑠𝑡 ,

(1a)

where 𝑌𝑐𝑠𝑡 is the arrest rate per 1,000 population for those ages 16-to-24 in county c in state s in
year t. The independent variable of interest ln(MWcst), is the natural log of the maximum of the
city, county, state, or Federal minimum wage for a given county in year t, measured in 2016
dollars.22, 23 The vector 𝑋𝑐𝑠𝑡 includes demographic and crime reporting controls (the share of the
county population that is African American, Hispanic, and male; the share of the state population
ages 25 and older who have a Bachelor’s degree or higher; and the number of agencies reporting
arrests in the county); the vector 𝐸𝑠𝑡 includes state-level economic controls (the natural log of the
average hourly wage rate of 25-to-54 year-olds and the natural log of the male unemployment
rate of 25-to-54 year-olds); the vector 𝐶𝑠𝑡 includes state-level crime policy controls (shall issue
concealed carry permit laws, the natural log of law enforcement employees per 1,000 population,
and the natural log of police expenditures per 1,000 population); and the vector 𝑃𝑠𝑡 includes
state-level health and social welfare policies (whether the state has a refundable EITC, whether

21

Following Currie and Fallick (1996), we also experimented with MW Gap, set equal to 0 if a worker earned a
wage higher than the minimum wage at year t+1, and equal to the difference between the minimum wage in period
t+1 and the worker’s wage in period t when the worker’s wage is between the old and new minimum wages. Albeit
less precise, the pattern of results is similar for regressions that replace Binding MW with MW Gap.
22

The county minimum wage is coded as the weighted average of the higher of the county/city minimum wage,
where the weight depends on the share of the year the wage is in effect. We experiment with alternative coding of
the minimum wage, including a weighted average of the prevailing county wage and the city wage, where the
weight depends on the share of the year the wage is in effect and the share of the county population that the city
represents as of the 2010 Census, and find similar patterns of results.
23

In some specifications, we also include an indicator for the presence of living wage laws, following Fernandez et
al. (2014).
13

the state Medicaid program has been expanded to include childless adults, whether all vehicles
are exempt from an asset test for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program eligibility, whether
the state minimum legal high school dropout age exceeds 17, whether the state has an E-Verify
mandate, whether the state or county has a “ban-the-box” employment law, whether the state has
a marijuana legalization or medical marijuana laws, and the natural log of the real beer tax).24 In
some specifications, we also include controls for state-specific time trends, both linear and
higher-order trends:
𝑌𝑐𝑠𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑙𝑛 (𝑀𝑊𝑐𝑠𝑡 ) + 𝑋𝑐𝑠𝑡 ′𝛼 + 𝐸𝑠𝑡 ′𝜑 + 𝐶𝑠𝑡 ′𝜃 + 𝑃𝑠𝑡 ′𝜔 + 𝜏𝑡 + 𝛿𝑐 + 𝜇𝑠 × 𝑡 + 𝜇𝑠 × 𝑡 2 + 𝜀𝑐𝑠𝑡 25

(1b)

In equations (1a) and (1b), identification of 𝛽1 comes from within-state, and occasionally
within-county, variation in minimum wages. For our estimates to be interpreted causally, the
common trends assumption must be satisfied. We take a number of tacks to address this
concern. First, we carry out an event-study analysis, with particular attention to whether pretreatment trends in arrests are similar between treatment and control jurisdictions. Our eventstudy approach accounts for the continuous and cumulative nature of minimum wage increases,
namely that (i) the magnitudes of minimum wage increases vary over time, and (ii) jurisdictions
may see multiple minimum wage increases over time. While specifying minimum wage events

We compile the share of population ages 25 and older with a Bachelor’s degree, the prime-age (ages 25-to-54)
average hourly wage and the prime-age male unemployment rate using the CPS Merged Outgoing Rotation Groups.
Population data are collected from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results, U.S. Population Data (SEER).
Police employment and expenditures are generated using data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Shall issue laws
are updated using the sources available in Anderson and Sabia (2018). State EITC data are collected from the Tax
Policy Center and E-verify data are collected from Churchill and Sabia (2019). Minimum legal dropout age data are
collected through 2008 using Anderson (2014) and updated to 2016 from the National Center of Education
Statistics. SNAP rules on vehicles are collected from U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service.
Medicaid eligibility is compiled using various reports by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Ban-the-box laws
are updated from Doleac and Hansen (2020) using the National Employment Law Project (2017). Marijuana
liberalization laws are updated using Sabia and Nguyen (2018). Beer taxes are collected from the Beer Institute.
Population-weighted means and standard deviations of the main dependent and independent variables can be found
in Table 1.

25

The inclusion of controls for state-specific time trends is intended to mitigate bias in the estimates of minimum
wage effects. However, the inclusion of these trends, particularly linear state time trends, may come at a cost of
reduced precision, eliminating important dynamic labor market effects of the minimum wage (Meer and West 2016:
Clemens 2019), or conflating minimum wage effects with the local business cycle (Neumark et al 2014a,b; Neumark
and Wascher 2017). Thus, we also examine the robustness of estimated crime elasticities to the inclusion of statespecific higher-order polynomial trends.

14

in this manner removes the non-parametric appeal of dichotomous event study specifications, it
aligns with the continuous minimum wage measure used in equations (1a) and (1b) and is most
similar to a distributed lag model.26 Following Schmidheiny and Siegloch (2019), we estimate:

𝑌𝑐𝑠𝑡 = 𝛾0 + ∑

𝑗
𝑗≠−3 𝑡𝑜−1 𝛾𝑗 𝐷𝑐𝑠𝑡

𝜑 + 𝐶𝑠𝑡
𝜃 + 𝑃𝑠𝑡
𝜔 + 𝜏𝑡 + 𝛿𝑐 + 𝜇𝑠 × 𝑡 + 𝜇𝑠 × 𝑡 2 + 𝜀𝑐𝑠𝑡 , (2)

𝑗

where j denotes event time and 𝐷𝑐𝑠𝑡 is a set of variables that captures the “intensity” of a
minimum wage increase (i.e., the difference between the natural logs of new and old minimum
wages) that occurred j periods from the time of the minimum wage change. Each 𝛾𝑗 is then a
difference-in-differences estimator of the cumulative effect of minimum wage increases on
arrests of 16-to-24 year-olds relative to the omitted time period j(c,s,t) = -3 to -1.27 We choose a
multiple year reference period of 1 to 3 years prior to enactment (i) to guard against any
idiosyncratic shock in a specific reference year driving our estimated contrasts, (ii) to avoid
under-identification of the parameters 𝛾𝑗 in settings with dynamic treatment effects and
jurisdiction-specific time trends (Borusyak and Jaravel 2017 suggest use of a “multiple period
reference window” of up to 3 periods) 28, and (iii) to ensure that the reference period includes a
time window prior to passage of the legislation (“pre-announcement period”).29 This event-study
framework will allow us to test for common trends prior to minimum wage enactment.
As an additional test of the common trends assumption, we explore heterogeneity in the
impact of minimum wages across the age distribution. Older, more experienced individuals, may
26

An alternative approach to the one we employ would be to estimate a traditional event study in which we
dichotomize minimum wage increases by their magnitudes (Simon 2016; Fuest et al. 2018). In Appendix Figure 1,
we show an event-study analysis of the top 25th percentile of real minimum wage increases over our sample period.
The results are qualitatively similar to those shown in Figure 2.
−6
For our two “endpoints” 𝐷𝑐𝑠𝑡
is the backward cumulated events that occurred six or more years into the sample
2
period, and 𝐷𝑐𝑠𝑡 is the forward cumulated events that occurred two or more years prior to the end of the sample
𝑗
period. Hence, the binned endpoints of 𝐷𝑐𝑠𝑡 capture the cumulative nature of minimum wage increases. See
Schmidheiny and Siegloch (2019) for a formal derivation of this event study approach, and for multiple numerical
examples.
27

28

Borusyak and Jaravel (2017) illustrate that fully-dynamic event study specifications (which include both unit and
time fixed effects) in staggered treatment adoption settings suffer from under-identification when only one pretreatment period is omitted. Additionally, when unit-specific time trends are included, it requires another pretreatment period to be omitted to achieve identification.
29

We also experiment with a reference window several years prior to enactment (4 to 6 years prior to enactment)
with a qualitatively similar pattern of results.

be less likely to be bound by the minimum wage or, may serve as labor-labor substitutes (or
complements) for younger, less experienced workers. Thus, to ensure that any “post-treatment”
trends we observe for 16-to-24 year-olds are not driven by differential trends unrelated to the
minimum wage, we explore whether effects differ for older workers. While these are imperfect
placebo tests, we expect smaller spillover effects to these workers.
Finally, our use of the NLSY97 will permit us to examine minimum wage effects for
those for whom minimum wages bind. Specifically, in the spirit of Beauchamp and Chan
(2014), we pool data from the 1998-2016 NLSY97 and estimate:
′
′
′
′
𝑌𝑎𝑖𝑠𝑡 = 𝛽0𝑎 + 𝛽1𝑎 𝐵𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑀𝑊𝑎𝑖𝑠𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖𝑠𝑡
𝜗 𝑎 + 𝐶𝑠𝑡
𝜃 + 𝐸𝑠𝑡
𝜑 + 𝑃𝑠𝑡
𝜔 + 𝜏𝑡 + 𝛿𝑠 + 𝜀𝑎𝑖𝑠𝑡 ,

(3)

where 𝑌𝑎𝑖𝑠𝑡 is an indicator for the type of crime we are observing for respondent i, in age group a
(ages 16-to-24 vs. 25 and older), in state s, during year t. Our primary coefficient of interest, 𝛽1𝑎 ,
captures the effect of minimum wage increases on criminal behavior for respondents (in age
group a) who are bound by such increases compared to those who are not. The vector Xist
includes individual-level controls for race/ethnicity, age, math PIAT (Peabody Individual
Achievement Test) scores, maternal education, and family income. The remainder of controls
are identical to those in equation (1). Here, identification comes from changes in workers’
wages and/or changes in minimum wage policies that affect the bindingness of the minimum
wage for a teen or young adult worker.

4. Results
4.1 UCR Results
Tables 2 through 5 show estimates of 𝛽1 from the UCR. All models are weighted by the
county population and standard errors are clustered on the state (Bertrand et al. 2004). Our
primary focus is on property and violent offenses (Part I offenses).
In Table 2, we present estimates of 𝛽1 from equation (1).30 Column (1) presents findings
from the most parsimonious specification, including only socio-demographic controls, while
column (2) adds economic controls, column (3) adds crime policy controls, column (4) adds
30

Estimates on the control variables present in Table 2 (column 4) appear in Appendix Table 3.
16

social welfare and health policy controls, column (5) adds state-specific linear time trends, and
column (6) adds state-specific quadratic time trends.31 Across specifications in Panel I, we find
consistent evidence that minimum wage increases are associated with increases in property crime
arrests for 16-to-24 year olds. The estimated arrest elasticity with respect to the minimum wage
is relatively stable across specifications, remaining around 0.2. We find no evidence that
minimum wage increases had a statistically significant effect on teen and young adults violent
crime arrests, though the estimated elasticities are positive (Panel II). These results suggest that
minimum wage increases induce income-generating crimes among young adults.32
To explore whether the effects we observe in Panel I of Table 2 can be explained by pretreatment trends in property crime arrests, we next report results from the event study analyses
described by equation (2). Panel (a) of Figure 2 shows that pre-treatment property arrests 16-to24 year-olds were similar for “treatment” and “control” counties. Following enactment of
minimum wage increases, we see substantial increases in property crime, with the largest
increases occurring one year after a minimum wage increase, after which there is a slight decline.
This pattern of pre- and post-treatment trends is consistent with minimum wage-induced
increases in property offense arrests. While we find that pre-treatment trends in violent offense
arrests were similar, we fail to detect any evidence that minimum wages impact violent crime
(Panel b).33
As a further test of the common trends assumption, we explore whether there are
heterogeneous crime effects of minimum wage hikes across the age distribution.34 Older, more
31

In Appendix Table 4, we present estimates from specifications that include higher-order polynomial trends and
census region-specific year effects. In the main, the results are qualitatively similar to the findings shown in Table
2.
32

In results available upon request, we supplement our UCR-based analyses with analyses using the NIBRS. In the
main, these results suggest that the property crime effects we find are largest in counties with populations of 100,000
or greater.
33

This finding is not sensitive to the functional form of the state-specific time trends included as controls. In Panels
(a) and (b) of Appendix Figure 2, we show very similar event-studies when using state-specific linear time trends as
opposed to quadratic time trends as controls.
34

For models that estimate crime effects for individuals ages 25 and older, we do not control for prime-age male
unemployment rates, prime-age wage rates, or the share of individuals ages 25 and older with a college degree, as
these measures may capture mechanisms through which minimum wages affect crime. Instead, following Clemens
and Wither (2019) and Agan and Makowsky (2020), we control for the state-level housing price index (available
from: https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index.aspx). This approach is designed to
control for macroeconomic conditions that are not directly affected by minimum wage changes.
17

experienced individuals are less likely to be bound by minimum wages and hence any crime
effects should likely be smaller. On the other hand, older individuals on the margin of crime
commission may be more likely than the average older individual to be bound. The results in
Panel I of Table 3 show that minimum wage hikes increase property crime arrests among
teenagers ages 16-to-19 (Panel I, column 1) and young adults ages 20-to-24 (Panel I, column 2),
with estimated elasticities of 0.162 to 0.270. There is little evidence of minimum wage-induced
increases in property crime arrests for older individuals, which adds to our confidence that
estimates of 𝛽1 for those ages 16-to-24 are not capturing differential jurisdiction-level time
trends. Finally, we find no evidence that minimum wage increases affect violent arrests among
younger or older individuals (Panel II of Table 3).35, 36
Finally, in column (8) of Table 3 we present estimates of the effect of minimum wages on
net crime among all working age individuals (16-to-64 year-olds). Our estimates are positive,
although statistically indistinguishable from zero, with estimated arrest elasticities around 0.08.
We next explore whether these effects differ by gender (Table 4) and offense type (Table
5). With regard to gender, we find that both male and female property crime rise similarly in
response to minimum wage increases, with estimated elasticities of 0.215 to 0.343 (Table 4).
Given that larcenies comprise 72 percent of all property offenses for 16-to-24 year-olds
during our sample period, we unsurprisingly find that the increase in property crime arrests for
teens and young adults is driven by larcenies (Panel I, Table 5), where the estimated arrest
elasticity is 0.241. There is no evidence that minimum wages affect other types of property
(burglary, motor vehicle theft, and arson) or violent (homicide, robbery, rape, and aggravated
assault) offenses (Panel II, Table 5). Finally, in Panel III of Table 5, we examine more minor

35

In Appendix Table 5, we explore finer age groups for property crime arrests and probe the sensitivity of estimated
arrest elasticities with respect to the minimum wage to the inclusion of state-specific time trends. We find estimates
similar to Table 3, with the most consistent evidence of minimum wage-induced increases in property crime
concentrated among 16-to-19 and 20-to-24 year-olds.
36

In an alternate specification, we separate out the effects of state legislative minimum wage increases as compared
to state minimum wages caused by changes in the Federal minimum wage over the time period (the 2007-2009
Federal increase from $5.15 to $7.25 per hour). We define an indicator variable Bound, that is set equal to one for a
state-year in which a state experiences a minimum wage increase that is due to one of the Federal minimum wage
increases between 2007-2009, and zero otherwise. We then re-estimate equation (1), including the Bound indicator
and the Ln(MW)*Bound interaction term (as well as the minimum wage main effect). In Appendix Table 6, we
present these estimates for 16-to-24 year-olds. While the coefficient on the interaction is positive, we do not detect
any evidence that state minimum wage increases caused by the 2007-2009 Federal increase were significantly
different from state legislative increases.
18

offenses (Part II offenses) and find that minimum wage hikes increase disorderly conduct arrests,
consistent with job-loss induced idleness among teens and young adults (Jacob and Lefgren
2003; Luallen 2006; Anderson 2014).37

4.2 Mechanisms: CPS Results
An important mechanism for minimum wage increases to influence property crime is
through their effects on the labor market outcomes of low-skilled workers. To explore this
possibility, we draw data from the 1998-2016 Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation
Groups. We restrict our sample to individuals ages 16-to-24 with less than a high school
diploma, as they are more likely to be bound by minimum wages and be on the margins of crime
commission.38 Table 6 shows these results.
Consistent with the prior literature, we find that minimum wage increases raise the hourly
wages of teen and young adult workers, with estimated wage elasticities of 0.168 to 0.199 (Table
6, Panel I). However, we also find evidence that minimum wage increases lead to a reduction in
employment, with estimated elasticities of -0.156 to -0.224 (Panel II). On the intensive margin,
we find a reduction in usual weekly hours worked (conditional on employment), with estimated
elasticities of -0.071 to -0.114 (Panel III). For unconditional weekly hours, we estimate
elasticities of -0.222 to -0.343 (Panel IV). These findings suggest that adverse labor demand
effects may be an important mechanism through which minimum wage increases lead to more
property crime. Finally, we find that minimum wage increases are negatively (though

37

To gauge whether crime effects differ across minimum wages as compared to living wage laws, in Appendix
Table 7, we include an indicator for living wage laws in our model, as well as an interaction term for whether a
living wage law applies to employers who receive financial assistance from the state or local government. For the
financial assistance living wage provision, we find that laws including them are associated with a statistically
significant 9.1 percent increase in property crimes. This result is consistent with evidence from the living wageemployment literature, which finds that living wage laws covering financial assistance recipients generates stronger
adverse employment effects (Neumark and Adams 2005a). We also find some evidence that living wage ordinances
are associated with increases in violent crime.
38

Means of labor market outcomes and school enrollment used in the CPS are available in Appendix Table 8.
19

imprecisely) related to weekly earnings (Panel V), but have relatively little effect on school
enrollment (Panel VI).39, 40
Event-study analyses are consistent with a causal interpretation of these results.41 In
specifications that exclude (Appendix Table 10) and include (Figure 3) state-specific time trends,
we find that the adverse labor demand effects we detect are not driven by differential pretreatment trends and are triggered following the enactment of the minimum wage hike.
Moreover, property offense arrests are largest in the post-treatment event year (j = 1) precisely
when employment and hours effects are largest, and both decline (in absolute magnitude) two
years following the minimum wage increase. Additionally, when we examine higher-skilled,
more experienced individuals, those ages 25-to-64 with a college degree or more, we find little
evidence of wage or employment effects following minimum wage increases (see Appendix
Figure 3).

4.3 NLSY97 Results
In Table 7A, we turn to individual-level panel data from the NLSY97 to explore whether
minimum wages have the biggest bite on those 16-to-24 year-olds for whom the minimum wage
is binding. That is, we move from the intent-to-treat framework of our UCR-based analysis to a
treatment-on-the-treated framework in the NLSY97, following an approach similar to Currie and
Fallick (1996) and Beauchamp and Chan (2014). We find that 16-to-24 year-olds bound by the
minimum wage are 1.8 percentage-points (12.9 percent) more likely to engage in criminal
activity, driven by a 1.7 percentage-point (21.3 percent) increase in property crime. For
minimum wage bound individuals ages 25 and older, we also find evidence of minimum wageinduced increases in property crime, as well as an increase in the probability of being arrested.

Using data from the CPS’s October Supplement from 1998-2016, we estimate the effects of minimum wage
increases on school enrollment via a probit model (Panel VI).
39

40

In Appendix Table 9, we present estimates that control for the state-level housing price index in place of controls
for the state-level prime-age male unemployment rate and prime-age wage rate. The estimates are qualitatively
similar to Table 6, actually showing stronger evidence of adverse labor demand effects. Estimates with these
alternate economic controls are also presented for arrests (Appendix Table 9, columns 1 and 2), with results
quantitatively similar to those presented in Table 2.
41

The adverse labor demand effects of the minimum wage are not sensitive to the functional form of the statespecific time trend, as shown in panels (c) and (d) of Appendix Figure 2
20

Thus, we find no evidence to support the claim that minimum wage hikes reduce crime among
those who are directly affected by it.42
As our CPS-based estimates suggest, the lack of any crime-reducing effects of minimum
wages may be explained by adverse labor demand effects borne by individuals bound by them.
Our findings in Table 7B provide strong evidence that minimum wage increases negatively
affect both the intensive and extensive margins of work, the likely mechanism at work.
Furthermore, our results show stronger property crime effects for those below the median annual
hours worked (Table 8, Panel I) as compared to individuals above the median (Table 8, Panel II),
consistent with labor demand effects being an important mechanism at work.

4.4 Comparisons with Prior Estimates
Two relatively recent papers produce some evidence of crime reducing effects of
minimum wages. We attempt to explain differences in our results from this prior work. First,
while focusing largely on living wages, estimates shown in Tables 3A-B of Fernandez et al.
(2014; pp. 488-489) show that minimum wages enacted between 1990 and 2010 reduced overall
property and violent crime in large cities. First, to replicate their specification, we generate total
arrest rates per 100,000 population for the 239 largest cities (as of 1990) from the UCR, collect
data on their controls, and use their preferred log-log specification to estimate the effect of
minimum wage increases on overall property (Panel I) and violent (Panel II) crime arrests from
1990-2010.43 The results in column (1) of Table 9 are consistent with their results: minimum
wage increases enacted between 1990 and 2010 resulted in large, statistically significant
reductions in aggregate city-level arrests. The inclusion of a set of observable demographic and
macroeconomic controls used by Fernandez et al. (2014) (column 2) produces an elasticity of 0.094 for property crime arrests and -0.237 for violent crime arrests, though both estimates are
statistically indistinguishable from zero at conventional levels. In columns (3) through (5), we

42

We also experimented with including controls for individual fixed effects, which would require individualspecific changes in the bindingness of minimum wages over time for identification. Estimated property crime
effects continue to be positive in these models, though the magnitudes of the estimated treatment effects are
somewhat smaller and only marginally significantly different from zero for bound workers.
43

Following Fernandez et al. (2014), we gather data for this replication using https://www.ucrdatatool.gov/, where
the FBI uses an imputation procedure to estimate crime rates for agencies with poor reporting. These data are only
available through 2014.

include controls for city-specific time trends; in these specifications, estimated property crime
elasticities become small and positive and violent crime arrests elasticities fall to near zero.
These results are largely consistent with our UCR-based findings nationwide, where we find
little evidence of net effects on arrests for working-age individuals.
Second, Agan and Makowsky (2020) find that minimum wage increases enacted between
2000 and 2014 are associated with a reduction in recidivism rates, mainly through reduced
property and drug crime. We explore whether our findings may differ due to (i) differences in
the states and years comprising the analysis sample, (ii) demographic composition of arrestees,
and (iii) margin of criminal behavior examined (recidivism versus overall crime). We collect
data on the controls used by Agan and Makowsky (2020) to rule out observable controls as an
explanation for differences in results.
In column (1) of Table 10, we estimate the effect of minimum wage increases on total
arrests for all ages using the sample of states and years that were available in the National
Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP), the data source used by Agan and Makowsky (2020).44,
45

We also use a specification similar to that employed by the authors. Our results show no

evidence that minimum wage increases affected net property, violent, or drug crime. Estimated
elasticities with respect to the minimum wage are 0.155 for property crime, 0.090 for violent
crime, and -0.137 for drug crime arrests, each statistically indistinguishable from zero at
conventional levels. These estimated effects are far more positive than the implied recidivism
elasticities obtained by Agan and Makowsky (2020; Table 8, columns 1-3), -0.553, -0.121, and 0.451, respectively. Adding the full set of states and years available in the UCR imputed crime
data files from 2000-2014 (column 2), we continue to find no evidence of minimum wageinduced declines in net crime.
To gauge whether results may differ across demographic groups, we also examine adults
ages 18 and older (columns 3-4), adult males (columns 5-6), and African American adults

44

In the sample of arrestees of all ages, we use imputed UCR crime compiled by the ICPSR. These data include
imputed crime counts for jurisdictions which have poor reporting, and are available from:
https://www.ojjdp.gov/OJSTATBB/ezaucr/asp/methods.asp
45

We identify the state-years available in the National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP) public use files by
state and year of release from prison, approximating the analysis sample used by Agan and Makowsky (2020).
Additionally, we drop California from the analysis sample, as does Agan and Makowsky (2020). The NCRP public
use files may be obtained from: https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/studies/37021
22

(columns 7-8). Across each of these demographic groups, we find no evidence of crime-reducing
effects of minimum wages. Expanding the sample period through 2015 and 2016 (columns 4, 6,
and 8) produces a similar pattern of results.46, 47 Together with the findings of Agan and
Makowsky (2020), our results in Table 10 suggest that minimum wage increases may have
heterogeneous effects on different margins of criminal behavior, including first-time arrests as
well as arrests that do not result in incarceration and release.

5. Conclusion
An April 2016 report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers claimed that
raising the Federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $12 per hour could reduce crime by 3 to 5
percent, generating substantial social benefits. However, this conclusion rested on the
assumption that minimum wage increases would only generate wage gains with no offsetting
employment or human capital effects. This study comprehensively examines the effects of
recent changes to Federal, state, and local minimum wages on crime. Our results suggest that
minimum wage increases enacted from 1998 to 2016 led to increases in property crime arrests
for those between the ages of 16-to-24, with an estimated elasticity of around 0.2. This finding is
robust to the inclusion of controls for state-specific time trends, survive falsification tests on
policy leads, and generally persist for workers who earn wages such that minimum wage changes
bind. Increases in property crime appear to be driven by adverse labor demand effects of
minimum wages. We find little evidence that minimum wage increases affect arrests for violent
or minor offenses.
Our back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that a 10 percent increase in the minimum
wage between 1998 and 2016 led to nearly 80,000 additional property crimes committed by 16to-24 year-olds, generating annual crime costs of $467 million (2019$) (McCollister et al.
2010).48 Moreover, if our estimated crime elasticities are used to make predictions of future

46

In Appendix Table 11, we present estimates using the Agan and Makowsky (2020) specification for 16-to-24
year-olds over the 2000-2014 and 2000-2016 period, which are consistent with our main results from Table 2.
47

In results available upon request, we also examine the effect of minimum wage increases on arrests among 25-to54 year-old males, an age demographic that comprises around 80 percent of the sample in Agan and Makowsky
(2020). We find little evidence of arrest-reducing effects of the minimum wage among this demographic group.
48

To generate this cost estimate, we first gather Part I property and violent crimes committed over the 1998-2016
period using the FBI’s Crime in the United States reports (available from: https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the23

policy changes, raising the Federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, as the Raise the Wage Act of
2019 proposes and is endorsed by Democratic Presidential Candidate Joe Biden49, would
generate approximately 423,000 additional property crimes and $2.5 billion in additional crime
costs.50 These could be lower bound estimates if living wage ordinances also have the
unintended consequence of increasing crime or if there are modest increases in delinquencyrelated crimes. Together, the findings from this study suggest that, in contrast to the CEA claim,
higher minimum wages are unlikely to be an effective tool to fight net crime.

u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/topic-pages/tables/table-1). We then use the UCR’s Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race
files from 1998-2016 to calculate the share of property crimes committed by 16-to-24 year-olds. To generate an
estimate of the number of crimes committed by 16-to-24 year-olds, we calculate the product of the average crime
counts over the 1998-2016 period from the FBI’s Crime in the United States report and the share of crimes
committed by 16-to-24 year-olds from the UCR’s Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race files. Using the estimated crime
elasticity with respect to the minimum wage of 0.210 for property crime (Table 2, Panel I, column 4), we estimate
79,902 additional property crimes would be generated by a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage. Then, we use
the per crime cost of a property offense of $5,844 (in 2019USD) from McCollister et al. (2010) to estimate the total
additional crime cost from a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage. We obtain an estimate of $467 million for
property crime.
49

Vice President Biden pledges to increase the Federal minimum wage to $15 as well as eliminate the Federal
tipped minimum wage. For more information, see: https://joebiden.com/empowerworkers/
50

To generate this cost estimate, we first gather state-specific Part I property crimes committed in 2016 using the
FBI’s Crime in the United States report (available from: https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.2016/topic-pages/tables/table-3). We then use the UCR’s Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race files from 2016 to calculate
the state-specific share of property crime committed by 16-to-24 year-olds. To generate the state-specific estimate
of the number of crimes committed by 16-to-24 year-olds, we calculate the product of state-level crime counts from
FBI’s Crime in the United States 2016 report and the share of crimes committed by 16-to-24 year-olds from the
UCR’s Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race files. Then, to calculate the state-specific percentage change in the minimum
wage caused by a $15 Federal minimum wage, we use the higher of the state or Federal minimum wage in July 2018
to calculate a state-specific measure of the increase in the minimum wage they would experience from a $15
minimum wage. Using our estimated property crime elasticity with respect to the minimum wage of 0.210 from
column (4) of Table 2, we estimate the number of additional property crimes that would be generated in each state.
Summing across states, we estimate 422,742 additional property crimes would be generated by a $15 minimum
wage. Then, we use the per crime cost of a property offense of $5,844 (in 2019USD) from McCollister et al. (2010)
to estimate the total additional crime cost from a $15 minimum wage of $2.5 billion.

16-to-24, UCR, 1998-2016

Panel (a): Arrests for Property Offenses

Panel (b): Arrests for Violent Offenses

Notes: Event study coefficients plotted from the regression outlined in equation (2). Error bars are 95 percent confidence intervals. Following Borusyak and
Jaravel (2017), we use a multiperiod reference period of 1 to 3 years prior to enactment given that the model includes jurisdiction-specific time trends.
Weighted OLS estimates are generated using data from the 1998-2016 Uniform Crime Reports. Arrest rates are arrests per 1,000 people ages 16-to-24. All
regressions include controls for county fixed effects, year fixed effects, state-specific linear and quadratic time trends, socio-demographic controls, economic
controls, crime policy controls, and social welfare & health controls (available in Table 1). Samples are restricted to counties with crime arrest rates within two
standard deviations of the county’s average crime arrest rate, and counties with a coverage indicator of at least 65%. Estimates are weighted by the county
population ages 16-to-24. Standard errors are clustered at the state level.

(CPS) Outgoing Rotation Groups (ORG). All regressions include age, state, year, and month fixed effects, as well as state-specific linear and quadratic time trends. The list of
socio-demographic controls, economic controls, crime policy controls and social welfare & health controls are available in Table 1. Panels (a), (c), and (d), are estimated via OLS;
Panel (b) is estimated via probit. Estimates are weighted using the sample weights provided by the CPS, and standard errors are clustered at the state level.

Notes: Weighted OLS estimates are generated using data from the 1998-2016 Uniform Crime Reports. Arrest
rates are arrests per 1,000 people of the specified age group. All regressions include controls for county fixed
effects, year fixed effects, socio-demographic controls, economic controls, crime policy controls, and social
welfare & health controls. Regressions in columns (3)-(6) do not control for prime-age male unemployment rates,
prime-age wage rates, or the share of individuals with a college degree to avoid controlling for mechanisms;
instead, they control for the state-level housing price index. Samples are restricted to counties with crime arrest

Notes: Weighted OLS estimates are generated using imputed UCR city crime data over the 1990-2010 period,
which include imputed crime counts for jurisdictions that have poor reporting. Controls from Fernandez et al.
(2014) include the percent of the county population that is African American, white, female, ages 0-19, 20-29, 3039, 40-49, and 50-64, as well city-level log of police per capita, the state-level log of imprisonment rates, adult
unemployment rates, and per capita personal income. Estimates are weighted by city population, and standard
errors are clustered at the state level.

a Estimates from columns (1)-(2) use imputed UCR crime, which include imputed crime counts for jurisdictions that have poor reporting.
b Estimates from columns (3)-(8) use data from the UCR’s Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race files, the data which we have used for Tables 1-5.
Notes: Weighted OLS estimates are generated using data from the 2000-2016 Uniform Crime Reports. Arrest rates are arrests per 1,000 people of the specified age group. All
regressions include controls for county fixed effects, year fixed effects, the number of agencies reporting to a county, county level percent male, African American, white, ages
0-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, and 50-64, as well as state level police per capita, state level housing price index, the share of individuals with a college degree, an indicator for
whether the governor is democrat, whether drug convicts are eligible for TANF benefits, whether parolees are eligible to vote, and the presence of a state EITC top-up. Samples
are restricted to counties with crime arrest rates within two standard deviations of the county’s average crime arrest rate, and counties with a coverage indicator of at least 65%.
Estimates are weighted by the county population of the specified age group. Standard errors are clustered at the state level.

Panel (a): Arrests for Property Offenses
Panel (b): Arrests for Violent Offenses

Panel (c): Ln(Hourly Wages | Employment)

Panel (d): Usual Weekly Hours

Notes: Event study coefficients plotted from the regression described in footnote 26. Error bars are 95 percent confidence intervals. Following Borusyak and
Jaravel (2017), we use a multiperiod reference period of 1 to 3 years prior to enactment given that the model includes jurisdiction-specific time trends. Events
are composed of dichotomous indicators for “large” minimum wage increases (in the top 25 th percentile of the percentage increases of real minimum wages)
48

that occurred j years from the date of the minimum wage increase. Weighted OLS estimates are generated using data from the 1998-2016 Uniform Crime
Reports for panels (a) and (b) and the 1998-2016 Current Population Survey (CPS) Outgoing Rotation Groups (ORG) for panels (c) and (d). Regressions in
panels (a) and (b) control for county fixed effects, year fixed effects, state-specific linear and quadratic time trends, socio-demographic controls, economic
controls, crime policy controls, and social welfare & health controls (available in Table 1). Regressions in panels (c) and (d) include controls for age fixed
effects, state fixed effects, year fixed effects, month fixed effects, state-specific linear and quadratic time trends, socio-demographic controls, economic
controls, crime policy controls, and social welfare & health controls. For panels (a) and (b), samples are restricted to counties with crime arrest rates within
two standard deviations of the county’s average crime arrest rate, and counties with a coverage indicator of at least 65%. Additionally, estimates from panels
(a) and (b) are weighted by the county population ages 16-to-24, with standard errors clustered at the state level. Estimates from panels (c) and (d) are
weighted using the sample weights provided by the CPS, with standard errors are clustered at the state level.

Notes: Weighted OLS estimates are generated using data from the 1998-2016 Uniform Crime Reports. Arrest
rates are arrests per 1,000 people of the specified age group. All regressions include controls for county fixed
effects, year fixed effects, socio-demographic controls, economic controls, crime policy controls, and social
welfare & health controls. Regressions in columns (3)-(8) do not control for prime-age male unemployment
rates, prime-age wage rates, or the share of individuals with a college degree to avoid controlling for
mechanisms; instead, they control for the state-level housing price index. Samples are restricted to counties with
crime arrest rates within two standard deviations of the county’s average crime arrest rate, and counties with a
coverage indicator of at least 65%. Estimates are weighted by the county population of the specified age group.
Standard errors are clustered at the state level.

Notes: Weighted estimates are generated using data from the 1998-2016 Uniform Crime Reports for columns (1) and (2), the 1998-2016 Current Population
Survey (CPS) Outgoing Rotation Groups (ORG) for columns (3) through (7), and the 1998-2016 CPS October Supplement for column (8). Regressions in
columns (1) and (2) control for county fixed effects, year fixed effects, socio-demographic controls, economic controls, crime policy controls, and social
welfare & health controls. Regressions in columns (3) through (8) include controls for age fixed effects, state fixed effects, year fixed effects, month fixed
effects, socio-demographic controls, economic controls, crime policy controls, and social welfare & health controls. For the economic controls, the prime-age
male unemployment rate and prime-age wage rate are replaced with the state-level housing price index. Columns (1)-(3) and (5)-(7) are estimated via OLS and
columns (4) and (8) are estimates via probit. For columns (1) and (2), samples are restricted to counties with crime arrest rates within two standard deviations of
the county’s average crime arrest rate, and counties with a coverage indicator of at least 65%. Additionally, estimates from columns (1) and (2) are weighted by
the county population ages 16-to-24, with standard errors clustered at the state level. Estimates from columns (3) through (8) are weighted using the sample
weights provided by the CPS, with standard errors are clustered at the state level.

Notes: Weighted OLS estimates are generated using data from the 2000-2016 Uniform Crime Reports. Arrest
rates are arrests per 1,000 people of the specified age group. All regressions include controls for county fixed
effects, year fixed effects, the number of agencies reporting to a county, county level percent male, African
American, white, ages 0-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, and 50-64, as well as state level police per capita, state level
housing price index, the share of individuals with a college degree, an indicator for whether the governor is
democrat, whether drug convicts are eligible for TANF benefits, whether parolees are eligible to vote, and the
presence of a state EITC top-up. Samples are restricted to counties with crime arrest rates within two standard
deviations of the county’s average crime arrest rate, and counties with a coverage indicator of at least 65%.
Estimates are weighted by the county population of the specified age group. Standard errors are clustered at the
