That elasticity can be measured by the response of the rate of change of consumption to changes in the expected real interest rate. A detailed study of data for the twentieth-century United States shows no strong evidence that the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is positive. Earlier studies flnding substantially positive elasticities are shown to suffer from a bias related to the timing of instrumental variables.\n\n",
