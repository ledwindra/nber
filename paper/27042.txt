Which Retail Outlets Generate the Most Physical Interactions?
Avi Goldfarb and Catherine Tucker
NBER Working Paper No. 27042
April 2020
JEL No. M38
ABSTRACT
This paper seeks to answer the simple question of what category of retail outlets generates the
most physical interactions in the regular course of life. In this way, we aim to bring a marketing
perspective to discussions about which businesses may be most risky from the standpoint of
spreading contagious disease. We use detailed data from people's mobile devices prior to the
implementation of social distancing measures in the United States. With this data, we examine a
number of potential indicators of risk of contagion: The absolute number of visits and visitors,
how many of the visits are generated by the same people, the median average distance traveled by
the visitor to the retailer, and the number of customers from Canada and Mexico. We find that
retailers with a single outlet tend to attract relatively few visitors, fewer one-off visitors, and have
fewer international customers. For retailers that have multiple stores the patterns are non-linear.
Retailers that have such a large number of stores that they are ubiquitous, tend to exhibit fewer
visits and visitors and attract customers from a smaller distance. However, retailers that have a
large enough footprint to be well known, but not large enough to be ubiquitous tend to attract a
large number of visitors
who make one-off visits, travel a long distance, and are
disproportionately international.

Introduction

COVID-19 has shut down large parts of the economy in order to save lives and increase
long run economic output (Grinberg, 2007).1 These non-pharmaceutical interventions have
a long history in epidemiology (Heymann and Shindo, 2020), and there is recent evidence
of effectiveness in the context of COVID-19 (Fang et al., 2020). At some point, it will be
time to consider which parts of the economy to open first. Which businesses should remain
open and which should shut? There is very little data to aid policymakers in these decisions
(Aledort et al., 2007). That decision will partly depend on the economic benefit of opening
those businesses with respect to employment, wages, and externalities on other industries.
Perhaps more importantly, it will depend on whether there is a risk that opening those
business will lead to a return to exponential growth of disease.
In this paper, we show that several key measures used in marketing analytics can also
be used to establish which kind of businesses are likely to generate higher risk. To do this
we highlight the evolution of several measures of retail traffic which have been developed in
the digital era using location data from mobile phones. We employ February 2020 data from
SafeGraph, which tracks over 40 million mobile devices in the US. This retail marketing data
allows us to track the number of visits and unique visitors, median distance traveled to a
retailer, the average time spent at a retail store, and number of foreign visitors across the
month. By understanding the different types of customers that different retail businesses
attract, we can provide suggestive guidance on the relative risk of opening businesses during
an epidemic.
We focus on the question of whether small retailers or retail brands with multiple storefronts present the most risk. This is already a policy question in economies which are seeking
to emerge from shutdown. For example, Austria has announced that it will allow small busi1

nesses to open before large businesses.2 Given the liquidity constraints experienced by small
retailers when faced with challenges (Dunne et al., 1988; Musso and Schiavo, 2008), this may
seem to be an attractive type of business to open up early especially given recent survey
evidence (Bartik et al., 2020), but in this paper we ask whether or not from a retail traffic
perspective such a policy is justified.
We find that smaller retailers generally give rise to fewer physical interactions between
people. Retailers with just a single store have fewer visitors and visits, more repeat visitors and fewer one-off visits. Surprisingly, brands with a very large physical footprint (as
measured by a large number of stores) also exhibit the same characteristics, and attract
customers from the smallest relative distance. We suggest this is because brands with over
5000 outlets in the US are relatively ubiquitous, and therefore do not act as a magnet for
shoppers to travel long distances to reach them. For example, Autozone, - a retailer that has
over 5000 retail stores in the US, has a large footprint in order to minimize travel time for
potential users, and does not act as a magnet for shoppers to make particularly long trips
to its store. On the other hand, brands that have a mid-size footprint of between 10-1000
stores do attract more visitors and visits, and one-off visits, and customers who travel a
longer distance to reach them. We speculate that this is because the brand is sufficiently
strong to resonate in customers’ minds, but the physical footprint is not large enough to
make the store ubiquitous in the sense of being present in most American neighborhoods.
This data on retail traffic relates to the risk of contagion. For example, the Center for
Disease Control (CDC) recommendations on postponing mass gatherings emphasize that
larger gatherings “offer more opportunities for person-to-person contact and therefore post
greater risk of COVID-19 transmission”3 . The Public Health Agency of Canada adds that

events that draw people from distant isolated communities generate greater risk.4 More
generally, it is well-established in the epidemiology literature that higher-density places where
more people interact increase the likelihood of the spread of contagious disease (Fenichel,
2013).
This paper contributes to two strands of the management literature.
The first are economics and management papers that aim to guide policy during the
time of global pandemic. These include papers have tried to use past history to guide policy
(Barro et al., 2020), those that have studied the effectiveness of social distancing directives
at halting the spread of the pandemic (Fang et al., 2020; Chiou and Tucker, 2020), and
those that have tried to project out the likely business effects of the pandemic (Baker et al.,
2020; Tucker and Yu, 2020; Baker et al., 2020). By contrast, this paper takes a marketing
perspective and provides input into the specific forward-looking policy question of how to
decide what a loosening of social distancing restrictions should look like.
The second are papers that have investigated the interaction between physical distance
and retailing. Recently much of this literature has investigated the role of the internet and
the ‘death of distance’ hypothesis (Kolko, 2000; Forman et al., 2009, 2018). Other work has
studied how the digitization of supply chains has affected the role of distance in the supply
of products to retail (Evans and Harrigan, 2005). Though much of this work has emphasized
the idea that the internet has shifted the role of distance in retailing, we show that there is
still substantial variation in the distance people travel to retailers, and that this seems to be
systematically related to the nature of their physical footprint.
More broadly, this paper seeks to use mobile phone data to help guide a general policy
framework about how to use mobile phone tracking data to estimate optimal public health
responses. Phone data has already been widely used in the public health response to COVID4

https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirusinfection/health-professionals/mass-gatherings-risk-assesment.html

19. Phones have helped trace past contacts of infected individuals (Servick, 2020). Phone
data has also been used to understand previous epidemics, such as the recent cholera epidemic
in Haiti (Bengtsson et al., 2015). In marketing, papers have used mobile phone tracking data
to try and optimize promotions and targeting (Ghose et al., 2019). Our analysis is specific
to retail establishments, but the measures we analyze would be useful inputs into a more
general model of how opening up specific workplaces would impact disease transmission.
Overall, this paper provides suggestive data and an empirical framework for helping
decision-makers with respect to a specific and suddenly important policy problem: Which
businesses can be allowed to open and which should remain shut in the face of COVID-19?
We recognize that this guidance would be one piece of a more complete assessment of
risk. While we are not epidemiologists, we believe our perspective provides a useful input
into their models. Interpreting our results to suggest that small businesses should be allowed
to open first requires a number of additional assumptions, including that spillovers from
still-closed larger businesses do not reverse our result, and that small businesses will be
as good as larger businesses at public health measures such as masks for employees, hand
sanitizer, and non-touch doors. Our results are not equilibrium, and do not take into account
spillovers to other workplaces or the potential heterogeneity of prevention practices across
businesses. Instead, our contribution is to demonstrate that a marketing perspective focused
on customer behavior and data-driven marketing analytics can inform epidemiological models
that simulate the impact of opening up different parts of the economy.

Data

We use data provided by Safegraph for the purposes of studying the spread of coronavirus
for February 2020. This data is built on a panel of 44,546,450 million devices that collect
anonymous location data. This represents about 10 percent of devices in the United States.5
5

https://www.safegraph.com/blog/what-about-bias-in-the-safegraph-dataset

5

Each of the users of these devices has given permission for their location to be tracked
by a variety of mobile apps. Safegraph matches the location of these devices to a variety
of locations of branded physical retail locations within the US, and its main business is
focused on providing data on retail traffic to firms and analysts.6 This is advantageous for
our purposes, as Safegraph’s business model means it has already done substantive work to
check the accuracy of the data.
There are several variables we focus on in particular. First, we examine the number of
visits and the number of unique visitors to a store. These are measured by the number of
times any mobile device visits a store location, and the number of times a unique device
visits the store location. As we use aggregated measures of devices and their behavior, we
do not have any insight about what the person holding the device was doing at that venue.
They may have been shopping, they may have been browsing, they may have been meeting
someone, or working at that store. Our measure does not distinguish between these purposes,
but given that in a pandemic the largest concern is whether people congregate, rather than
why they are congregating, we believe this does not pose too large a challenge for our core
objective, though it does restrict the interpretation of the analysis.
The second variable is the median distance that month that a device traveled to go to
that retail outlet. This is measured from the place that Safegraph has assigned as the home
of the device. The home of the device is assigned to the place where that device spent the
most time overnight. Evidently there is the potential for measurement error in the allocation
of the home of the device if someone works overnight or stays overnight at another person’s
house regularly. However, given that we are interested predominantly in distance traveled
to the store by the device, rather than distance traveled from home to the store, we believe
that this type of error will not be consequential from our measurement.
6

Safegraph also shared data with researchers who are working on measuring the effects of the spread of
COVID-19.

Third, we examine time spent at the store. The effect of time spent at a store on contagion
is ambiguous. More time spent at the store increases the likelihood of contagion at that store.
At the same time, it means that those people are less likely to visit a large number of other
stores. In other words, if non-branded stores have customers who spend more time, then
it is unlikely that those customers visit a larger number of stores. We display the results,
but a full assessment of the implications of time spent requires additional data and a more
complete model.
Fourth, we examine devices that appear to be based in Canada and Mexico but travel to
the US regularly. These are a small fraction of the data, and when we analyze these visits by
foreign devices we focus on the states bordering each country in the US, where these visits
tend to happen. We include this as an incomplete measure of the degree to which foreign
nationals tend to visit stores within the US.
We use data from February 2020. We choose this period as this was before people in the
US shifted behavior towards self-isolation. On February 29th, the US experienced its first
COVID-19 death. Our intention therefore with this selection of data is that it provides the
last glimpse of normal human traffic patterns prior to the shifts in behavior due to intentional
social distancing. We look at the entire month of February, and use data on over 1 million
commercial retail locations in the US, for which Safegraph had allocated a NAICS code. To
look at retailers we focus on all locations which had the 2-digit NAICS code of 44-45 which
spans the category of ‘Retail Trade’.
This dataset is focused on the US. Two avenues exist whereby the data is potentially
not representative of behavior in February 2020. First, it does not represent behavior of
people who do not have smartphones. Another source of bias is that the people who opt in
to allow their location to be tracked may not be representative of the population. Goldfarb
and Tucker (2012) show that willingness to divulge personal information decreases with age.
Athey et al. (2017) suggests that to some extent the decision to divulge information is highly
7

contextual and can be easily shifted through small incentives and changes in interfaces,
implying that at least potentially some randomness in the decision to divulge may exist.
Safegraph suggest that their data does align with Census data.7
Table 1 provides summary statistics for the Safegraph data. It suggests that the average
distance traveled is 19.6 km to the retail store in our data, but the median is 8.6 km. On
average people spent 30 minutes in a store, with a median of 20 minutes. The average store
had 176 separate visitors and 283 visits during the month from devices in the Safegraph data.
The ‘Visitor to Visit Ratio’ measures the extent to which the same visitor made multiple
visits. A value of 1 indicates that no visitors made repeat visits. A lower value indicates
that visitors tended to make repeat visits throughout the month.
Table 1 also provides some insights into the nature of the retail stores in our data. The
average number of outlets is 1221.4, but this is highly skewed. The median number of oulets
is 1, with 52% of the data having a single outlet. To deal with the skewed nature of this
variable in our analysis, we created a series of binary indicators which indicate what bucket
in terms of number of outlets that particular retail chain belongs to. Most of these buckets
consist of around 10% of our observed data, with the exception of the indicator for 10-99
outlets which is 6% of our observed data.
11% of the outlets are gas stations. 14% of outlets are devoted to food. 3% are drug
stores. We exclude gas stations, pharmacies and food retailers for some of our analysis,
as these are retailers are usually classified as ‘essential businesses’ whose opening is not in
question.
The specific stores that tended to exhibit the greatest distance traveled were not particular surprising. For example, ‘Pilot Flying J,’ a chain of truck stops had a median distance
traveled to them of 379km. ABC Stores - a chain of stores that targets tourists in Hawaii 7

had an average median distance of 2329km. The stores that exhibited the greatest number
of visitors were also not surprising - Walmart accounts for 73% of all stores that had over
10,000 visits.
Table 2 breaks down these summary statistics by 3-digit NAICS codes for the different
types of stores in our data. It is clear that there are large differences by type of store.
Clothing stores attract people from the furthest distance. General stores (which encompass
brands such as Walmart and Target) attract the most visits and visitors. Home stores have
the most repeat customers, while clothing stores have the fewest repeat visitors. Stores
with only a single outlet are most concentrated in the leisure category, which spans music,
books, sports, and hobbies. In the appendix Figures A1, A2 and A3, we provide further
breakdowns of Table 2, for single-outlet, mid-tier, and large footprint brands. There are
no brands of stores in our data that have over 5000 outlets in the Furniture, Misc, Gas, or
Leisure categories, so we also checked the robustness of our results to their exclusion.

Empirical Analysis

Figure 1 and 2 look at the number of visits and vistors by number of outlets. They show
similar patterns, in that brands that only have a single storefront receive fewer visits and
visitors. The number of visits and visitors peaks at stores that have between 1000-5000
outlets.
Because there are differences across location and store-type that this graphical evidence
does not take into account, we shift to regressions. Our empirical specification is straightforward. It presents the descriptive statistics from the figures above, but in regression form in
order to control for zip code and type of store. For store i of type k in zipcode z, we model
visitation pattern as:

V isitationP attern = βN umberof Outlets + αk + γz + z
Our focus is on how the stores’s physical footprint, or number of individual outlets across
the US, affects visitation patterns. αk is a vector of fixed effects for the different six-digit

10

Figure 1: Number of Visits

Figure 2: Number of Visitors

NAICS codes of stores in our data. γz is a vector of fixed effects for each zipcode.
Table 3 examines how the extent of a brand’s physical store footprint affects visitation
patterns. More visits and more visitors likely mean more risk of contagion. Columns (1)-(3)
look at the entire data set, and Columns (4)-(6) excludes Gas Stations, Food Stores, and
Drug Stores. The motivation for this exclusion is that most stay-at-home orders exclude
pharmacies, gas stations, and food stores from having to shut because they are essential
services. Therefore, given our focus is on helping policy makers understand which stores to
open first, it makes sense to look at stores which are shut as a result of a variety of state
directives.
There is a reasonably consistent pattern that stores with just one outlet (the excluded
group) attracted fewer visitors and visits, while stores with more than 1000 outlets but fewer
than 5000 outlets tend to attract the most visitors and the most visits. In addition, stores
with the largest number of outlets attract relatively few visitors. These large stores also
exhibit fewer visits than single storefronts when we control for location and store-type. In
order to check that this pattern was not driven by differences in number of outlets across
categories, we confirmed robustness to excluding categories such as electronics and clothing
where chains did not have more than 1000 outlets.

Figure 3 shows that the stores with the largest number of outlets tend to have customers
who travel the least distance and who spend the least time. Stores with 10-99 outlets have
a relatively large distance traveled.
Table 4 presents these descriptive statistics on distance traveled and time spent in regression form. In Columns (1) and (3) we present results for the full sample. In Columns
(2) and (4) we present results for non-essential businesses only.
The results suggest that similar to Figure 3, there is a non-linear pattern in terms of
how far people travel to visit stores. In general, if a brand is large enough to be relatively
ubiquitous and has hundreds of stores, then people are less likely to travel far to visit.
Presumably by the time a brand has 5000 outlets it is likely trying to minimize travel time
for its potential customers. By contrast brands where there are fewer than 100 outlets (but
more than a single outlet) are more likely to attract people to drive a greater distance.

and Alaska since they might be expected (given the distances tourists travel to them) to have
particularly long median distances traveled. The general pattern of results remains similar.
The results for time spent, by contrast, suggest a linear pattern in how a brand’s physical
footprint affects how long people stay there. People are most likely to spend longest at a
retail store with a single storefront. By contrast, as a brand’s retail store footprint becomes
ubiquitous, people are less likely to stay long at the outlet. Therefore, it is unlikely that
visitors to these single outlet stores visit a larger number of stores.
Table 5 looks at how foreign visitors to a store vary with the store’s footprint. In general,
Canadian visitors are more likely to visit stores with a midsize footprint and less likely to
visit stores that are either more ubiquitous or a single storefront. One explanation of this is
simply that these visits reflect Canadians crossing the border in attempt to shop at stores
with lower prices than those found in Canada, and that price-orientated stores that do not
exist in Canada tend to have these mid-tier footprints. There are somewhat similar patterns
for Mexican visitors, but many of our estimates are not significant.

Conclusion

This paper uses metrics of retail foot-traffic which are commonly used in marketing analytics,
to provide policymakers with suggestive evidence about what kind of businesses can be most
safely opened up when the economy emerges from directives that closed down all but essential
businesses. We demonstrate that such metrics may be a useful input into policy models which
evaluate which businesses are safest to allow to reopen in the wake of a global pandemic.
In this paper we present evidence that is generally supportive of a policy which enables
small businesses, particularly stores with a single retail storefront, to open first. These stores
attract fewer visits and fewer visitors, and more repeat customers. However, their customers
do travel a longer distance and spend longer in the store relative to stores whose brands are
relatively ubiquitous.
There are limitations to our paper. First, we look simply at mobile tracking data. We do
not have any information about what types of activities (working, browsing, or purchasing)
people took in these stores. Second, we do not try and make a relative assessment of which
of the factors we consider - distance traveled, time spent, number of visits, number of visitors
and visitor to visit ratio - is most important to prioritize when making decisions about which
stores to allow to open first. Third, we have very limited behavior on the pattern of people
who have visited foreign countries, and the data we have is unlikely to be representative of the
behavior of such people in general, as it appears we are mainly capturing the actions of people
who cross the border to save money by shopping in the US. Fourth, data from February may
not fully represent traffic patterns during the time period that policy-makers are considering
re-opening businesses. Notwithstanding these limitations, we believe that this paper is a
useful step for trying to set up a framework to evaluate what kind of businesses should open
first, providing a marketing perspective to a key input into models of non-pharmaceutical
interventions.
