ABSTRACT
We extend Farmer's (2012b) Monetary (FM) Model in three ways. First, we derive an analog of
the Taylor Principle and we show that it fails in U.S. data. Second, we use the fact that the model
displays dynamic indeterminacy to explain the real effects of nominal shocks. Third, we use the
fact the model displays steady-state indeterminacy to explain the persistence of unemployment.
We show that the FM model outperforms the NK model and we argue that its superior
performance arises from the fact that the reduced form of the FM model is a VECM as opposed
to a VAR.

Keynesian Economics Without the Phillips Curve
By Roger E.A. Farmer and Giovanni Nicolò∗
We extend Farmer’s (2012b) Monetary (FM) Model in three ways.
First, we derive an analog of the Taylor Principle and we show that
it fails in U.S. data. Second, we use the fact that the model displays dynamic indeterminacy to explain the real effects of nominal
shocks. Third, we use the fact the model displays steady-state indeterminacy to explain the persistence of unemployment. We show
that the FM model outperforms the NK model and we argue that
its superior performance arises from the fact that the reduced form
of the FM model is a VECM as opposed to a VAR.

United States macroeconomic data are well described by co-integrated nonstationary time series (Nelson and Plosser, 1982). This is true, not just of data
that are growing such as GDP, consumption and investment. It is also true of data
that are predicted by economic theory to be stationary such as the unemployment
rate, the output gap, the inflation rate and the money interest rate, (King et al.,
1991; Beyer and Farmer, 2007).1
The dominant New Keynesian paradigm is a three-equation model that explains
persistent high unemployment by positing that wages and prices are ‘sticky’ (Galı́,
2008; Woodford, 2003). Sticky-price models have difficulty generating enough
persistence to understand the near unit root in unemployment data, as do models
of the monetary transmission mechanism that assume sticky information (Mankiw
and Reis, 2007) or rational inattention, (Sims, 2001a).2
Farmer (2012b) provides an alternative explanation of persistent high unemployment that we refer to as the Farmer Monetary (FM) model.3 The FM model
differs from the three-equation NK model by replacing the Phillips curve with
the belief function (Farmer, 1993), a new fundamental that has the same methodological status as preferences and technology. In the FM model, search frictions

1 A bounded random variable, such as the unemployment rate, cannot be a random walk over its
entire domain. We view the I(1) assumption to be an approximation that is approximately valid for
finite periods of time.
2 We prefer to avoid the assumption of menu costs (Mankiw, 1985) or price rigidity (Christiano et al.,
2005; Smets and Wouters, 2007), because our reading of the evidence as surveyed by Klenow and Malin
(2010), is that prices at the micro level are not sticky enough to explain the properties of monetary
shocks in aggregate data. The approach we follow here generates permanent equilibrium movements in
the unemployment rate that are consistent with a unit root, or near unit root, in U.S. unemployment
data.
3 Farmer and Konstantin Platonov (Farmer and Platonov, 2016) build on this idea to explain the relationship between the FM model and alternative interpretations of the textbook IS-LM model (Mankiw,
2015) on which modern New-Keynesian models are based.

lead to the existence of multiple steady state equilibria, and the steady-state
unemployment rate is determined by aggregate demand.
The FM model displays both static and dynamic indeterminacy. Static indeterminacy means there are many possible equilibrium steady-state unemployment
rates. Dynamic indeterminacy means there are many dynamic equilibrium paths,
all of which converge to a given steady state. We resolve both forms of indeterminacy with a belief function that pins down a unique rational expectations
equilibrium.
The structural properties of the FM model translate into a critical property
of its reduced form. Appealing to the Engle-Granger Representation Theorem
(Engle and Granger, 1987), we show that the FM model’s reduced form is a
co-integrated Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). The inflation rate, the
output gap, and the federal funds rate, are non-stationary but display a common
stochastic trend. The fact that our model is described by a VECM, rather than
a VAR, implies that it displays hysteresis. In the absence of stochastic shocks,
the model’s steady-state depends on initial conditions.
The FM model was introduced by Farmer (2012b) in a paper in which he
discussed the limitations of the NK model and proposed the FM model as an
alternative. Our paper extends his work in three directions.4
First, we study the role of monetary feedback rules in stabilizing inflation, the
output gap and the unemployment rate in the FM model.5 It is well known that
the NK model has a unique determinate steady state when the central bank reacts
aggressively to stabilize inflation, a concept that Michael Woodford (2003) refers
to as the Taylor principle. We develop the FM analog of the Taylor principle and
we show that it does not hold in the U.S. data either before or after 1980.
Second, we use the fact that our analog of the Taylor Principle fails to hold in
the U.S. data to explain the observation that monetary shocks have real effects.
Unlike the NK model, which assumes that prices are exogenously sticky, we explain the real effects of nominal shocks as an endogenous equilibrium response to
nominal shocks which is enforced by the properties of the belief function.
Third, we exploit the property of static indeterminacy to explain why the unemployment rate has a (near) unit root, in U.S. data. Our model resolves both
dynamic indeterminacy and static indeterminacy by introducing beliefs about
future nominal income growth as a new fundamental. We assume that individuals form expectations about future nominal income growth and we model these
expectations as a martingale as in Farmer (2012b).
4 Related papers to our current work are those of Farmer (2012a,b), Plotnikov (2012, 2013) and Farmer
and Platonov (2016). Farmer (2012b) develops the basic three-equation model that we work with here
and he discusses the philosophy that distinguishes his approach from the NK model. Farmer (2012a)
developed the labor market theory that accounts for persistent unemployment and Plotnikov (2013, 2012)
adds investment and capital accumulation. Farmer and Platonov (2016) extend the theoretical model of
Farmer (2012a) by adding money.
5 Because there is a one-to-one mapping between the output gap and the difference of unemployment
from its natural rate, we will move freely in our discussion between these two concepts.

Relationship with Previous Literature

Our paper is connected with an empirical literature that studies the medium
term persistence of business cycles. This includes the work of Robert King,
Charles Plosser, James Stock and Mark Watson (1991), Diego Comin and Mark
Gertler (2006), King and Watson (1994), and Andreas Beyer and Farmer (2007).
Importantly, this literature finds that the unemployment rate is highly persistent and one cannot reject the hypothesis that the unemployment rate is a random walk. Viewed through the lens of neoclassical or New Keynesian theoretical
models, the persistence of the unemployment rate is a supply side phenomenon.
Something must be changing in either technology or preferences to cause permanent changes in the natural rate of unemployment.6
The supply-side approach is not the only way to interpret the fact that unemployment is persistent. As Christopher Sims demonstrated in his seminal paper
on Vector Autoregressions (Sims, 1980), rational expectations models are typically under-identified.7 That fact leads to an important question: Is the persistent
slow-moving component of the unemployment rate caused by aggregate supply
shocks, or is it caused by aggregate demand shocks? This paper is part of a
growing literature that provides theory and evidence in favor of the demand-side
explanation for the persistence of high unemployment following a recession.8
II.

The Structural Forms of the NK and FM Models

In Section II we write down the two structural models that form the basis
for our empirical estimates in Section VII. These models have two equations in
common. One of these is a generalization of the NK IS curve that arises from the
Euler equation of a representative agent. The other is a policy rule that describes
how the Fed sets the fed funds rate. The two common equations of our study are
described below.9
6 This is the interpretation of Robert Gordon (Gordon, 2013), who argues that unemployment is nonstationary because the natural rate of unemployment is a random walk. Because the natural rate of
unemployment is associated with the solution to a social planning optimum, if persistent unemployment
were caused by a permanent increase in the natural rate of unemployment, high persistent unemployment
would, at least to a first approximation, be socially optimal. That is possible, but in our view, implausible.
7 Building on that idea, Beyer and Farmer (2004) provided an algorithm to construct families of
models, all of which have the same likelihood in a given data set. Some of the models generated by their
method lead to a unique determinate equilibrium; others lead to an indeterminate equilibrium driven by
self-fulfilling beliefs. Both classes of theoretical models have the same likelihood.
8 Lawrence Summers (Summers, 2014) has recently resurrected a term secular stagnation coined by
Alvin Hansen (Hansen, 1939) to refer to the fact that the economy may be stuck in a period of permanent
under-employment equilibrium and Gauti Eggertsson and Neil Mehrotra (Eggertsson and Mehrotra,
2014) have formalized Hansen’s mechanism in an overlapping generations framework. My own previous
work Farmer (2012a); Farmer and Platonov (2016) provides a complete internally consistent explanation
of secular stagnation that is consistent with the fact that the stock market and the unemployment rate are
cointegrated random walks (Farmer, 2013). Olivier Blanchard and Summers (Blanchard and Summers,
1986, 1987) provided an alternative explanation.
9 Our discussion in sections II and III closely follows Farmer (2012b).

Two Equations that the NK and FM Models Share in Common

We assume the log of potential real GDP grows at a constant rate and we
estimate this series by regressing the log of real GDP on a constant and a time
trend. The residual series is our empirical analog of the output gap. The FM
model implies that the output gap is non-stationary and cointegrated with the
CPI inflation rate and the federal funds rate. The NK model implies that the
output gap is stationary.
In Equations (1) and (2), yt is our constructed output gap measure, Rt is the
federal funds rate and πt is the CPI inflation rate. The term zd,t is a demand
shock, zR,t is a policy shock and zs,t is a random variable that represents the Fed’s
estimate of potential GDP.10

(1) ayt − aEt (yt+1 ) + [Rt − Et (πt+1 )]
= η (ayt−1 − ayt + [Rt−1 − πt ]) + (1 − η)ρ + zd,t .
(2)

Rt = (1 − ρR )r̄ + ρR Rt−1 + (1 − ρR ) [λπt + µ (yt − zs,t )] + zR,t .

Equation (1) is a generalization of the dynamic IS curve that appears in standard representations of the NK model. In the special case when η = 1 this
equation can be derived from the Euler equation of a representative agent.11 An
equation of this form for the general case when η 6= 1 can be derived from a
heterogeneous agent model (Farmer, 2016) where the lagged real interest rate
captures the dynamics of borrowing and lending between patient and impatient
groups of people. In the case when η = 1, the parameter a is the inverse of the
intertemporal elasticity of substitution and ρ is the time preference rate.
Equation (2) is a Taylor Rule (Taylor, 1999) that represents the response of the
monetary authority to the lagged nominal interest rate, the inflation rate and the
output gap. The monetary policy shock, zR,t , denotes innovations to the nominal
interest rate caused by unpredictable actions of the monetary authority. The
parameters ρR , λ and µ are policy elasticities of the fed funds rate with respect
to the lagged fed funds rate, the inflation rate and the output gap.
B.

Two Equations that Differentiate the Two Models

The third equation of the NK model is given by
(3.a)

πt = βEt [πt+1 ] + φ (yt − zs,t ) .

10 More precisely, z
s,t is the Fed’s estimate of the deviation of the log of potential GDP from a linear
trend.
11 See for example Galı́ (2008), or Woodford (2003).

KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS

Here, β is the discount rate of the representative person and φ is a compound
parameter that depends on the frequency of price adjustment. Since β is expected
to be close to one, we will impose the restriction β = 1 when discussing the
theoretical properties of the model. This restriction implies that the long-run
Phillips curve is vertical. If instead, β < 1, the NK model has an upward sloping
long-run Phillips curve in inflation-output gap space. An extensive literature
derives the NK Phillips curve from first principles, see for example Galı́ (2008),
based on the assumption that frictions of one kind or another prevent firms from
quickly changing prices in response to changes in demand or supply shocks.
In contrast to the NK Phillips curve, the FM model is closed by a belief function
(Farmer, 1993). The functional form for the belief function that we use in this
study is described by Equation (3.b),
(3.b)

Et [xt+1 ] = xt ,

where xt ≡ πt + (yt − yt−1 ) is the growth rate of nominal GDP.
The belief function is a mapping from current and past observable variables
to probability distributions over future economic variables. In the functional
form we use here, it asserts that agents’ forecast about future nominal GDP
growth will equal current nominal GDP growth; that is, nominal GDP growth
is a martingale. Farmer (2012b) has shown that this specification of beliefs is a
special case of adaptive expectations in which the weight on current observations
of GDP growth is equal to 1.12
In the FM model, the monetary authority chooses whether changes in the current growth rate of nominal GDP will cause changes in the expected inflation rate
or in the output gap. Importantly, these changes will be permanent. The belief
function, interacting with the policy rule, selects how demand and supply shocks
are distributed between permanent changes to the output gap, and permanent
changes to the expected inflation rate.
III.

The Steady-State Properties of the Two Models

In this section we compare the theoretical properties of the non-stochastic
steady-state equilibria of the NK and FM models. The NK model has a unique
steady-state equilibrium. The FM model, in contrast, has a continuum of nonstochastic steady-state equilibria. Which of these equilibria the economy converges to depends on the initial condition of a system of dynamic equations. This
property is known as hysteresis.13
Rather than treat the multiplicity of steady state equilibria as a deficiency, as
is often the case in economics, we follow Farmer (1993) by defining a new fundamental, the belief function. When the model is closed in this way, equilibrium
12 Farmer (2012b) allowed for a more general specification of adaptive expectations and he found that
the data favor the special case we use here.
13 This analysis reproduces the discussion from Farmer (2012b) and we include it here for completeness.

uniqueness is restored and every sequence of shocks is associated with a unique
sequence of values for the three endogenous variables.
We begin by shutting down shocks and describing the theoretical properties of
the steady-state of the NK model. The values of the steady-state inflation rate,
interest rate and output gap in the NK model are given by the following equations

(3)

π̄ =

φ(r̄ − ρ)
,
φ(1 − λ) − µ(1 − β)

R̄ = ρ + π̄,

ȳ = π̄

(1 − β)
.
φ

When β < 1, the long-run Phillips curve, in output gap-inflation space, is upward
sloping. As β approaches 1, the slope of the long-run Phillips curve becomes
vertical and these equations simplify as follows,
(4)

π̄ =

(r̄ − ρ)
,
(1 − λ)

R̄ = ρ + π̄,

ȳ = 0.

For this important special case, the steady state of the NK model is defined by
Equations (4).
Contrast this with the steady state of FM model, which has only two steady
state equations to solve for three steady state variables. These are given by the
steady state version of the IS curve, Equation (1), and the steady state version
of the Taylor Rule, Equation (2).
The FM model is closed, not by a Phillips Curve, but by the belief function.
In the specific implementation of the belief function in this paper we assume that
beliefs about future nominal income growth follow a martingale. This equation
does not provide any additional information about the non-stochastic steady state
of the model because the same variable, steady-state nominal income growth,
appears on both sides of the equation.
Solving the steady-state versions of equations (1) and (2) for π̄ and R̄ as a
function of ȳ delivers two equations to determine the three variables, π̄, R̄ and ȳ.
(5)

π̄ =

(r̄ − ρ)
µ
+
ȳ,
(1 − λ) (1 − λ)

R̄ = ρ + π̄.

The fact that there are only two equations to determine three variables implies
that the steady-state of the FM model is under determined. We refer to this
property as static indeterminacy. Static indeterminacy is a source of endogenous
persistence that enables the FM model to match the high persistence of the unemployment rate in data and it implies that the reduced form representation of
the FM model is a VECM, as opposed to a VAR.
An implication of the static indeterminacy of the model is that policies that
affect aggregate demand have permanent long-run effects on the output gap and
the unemployment rate. In contrast, the NK model incorporates the Natural Rate
Hypothesis, a feature which implies that demand management policy cannot affect

real economic activity in the long-run.

The FM Analog of the Taylor Principle: A Simple Case

In this section we discuss the NK Taylor Principle and we derive an analog
of this principle for the FM model. For both the NK and FM models we study
the special case of ρR = 0, and η = 0. The first of these restrictions sets the
response of the Fed to the lagged interest rate to zero. The second restricts the
IS curve to the representative agent case. These restrictions allow us to generate,
and compare, analytical expressions for the Taylor Principle in both models.
The special cases of Equations (1) and (2) are given by
(1′ )

ayt = aEt (yt+1 ) − (Rt − Et (πt+1 )) + ρ + zd,t ,

and
(2′ )

Rt = r̄ + λπt + µ (yt − zs,t ) + zR,t .

The Taylor Principle directs the central bank to increase the federal funds rate
by more than one-for-one in response to an increase in the inflation rate. When
the Taylor Principle is satisfied, the dynamic equilibrium of the NK model is
locally unique. When that property holds, we say that the unique steady state is
locally determinate (Clarida et al., 1999).
When the central bank responds only to the inflation rate, the Taylor principle
is sufficient to guarantee local determinacy. When the central bank responds to
the output gap as well as to the inflation rate, a sufficient condition for the NK
model to be locally determinate is that
(6)

1−β
µ > 1.
φ

For the important special case of β = 1 this reduces to the familiar form of the
Taylor principle (Woodford, 2003).
In Appendix A we derive this result analytically and we compare it with the
dynamic properties of the FM model. There we establish that for the special
case of logarithmic preferences, that is when a = 1, a sufficient condition for local
determinacy in the FM model is,
(7)

λ
> 1.
λ−µ

This is our FM analog of the Taylor principle. In the usual case when λ and µ
are positive, it requires the interest-rate response of the central bank to changes in
inflation to be greater than the output-gap response. When this condition holds,
each element of the set of steady state equilibria of the model is dynamically

V.

The FM Analog of the Taylor Principle: The General Case

When the representative agent has CRA preferences with a 6= 1, the FM version
of the Taylor principle is more complicated and we are unable to find an analytic
expression except in the case when λ = µ.14 In this special case, the Taylor
Principle fails whenever
(8)

a<1+

λ
.

Although the parameter restriction, λ = µ, is unlikely to hold in practice, it
does give us an indication of whether or not the FM Taylor principle is likely to
hold outside of the case of logarithmic preferences. The answer to that question
is no. Consider, as an example, the special case when λ = µ = 0.7. For this
parametrization, the determinacy condition fails when a is larger than 1.35. Since
estimates of a in data are typically larger than 2, it seems likely that failure of the
Taylor Principle will be the normal case. Indeed, that conjecture is verified by
our empirical estimates. When we allow λ and µ to differ and we estimate them
using Bayesian techniques, our estimated model displays dynamic indeterminacy
for positive values of a that are greater than, but much closer to, one.
In Figure 1 we set three key parameters to their estimated values of η = 0.89,
ρ = 0.021, and ρR = 0.98 and we plot the roots of the system as functions of the
risk-aversion parameter a. This matrix always has a unit root and a root of zero.15
The determinacy condition requires that the remaining two roots must both be
greater than one in absolute value. The figure shows that for our estimated
parameter values, one root falls below unity in absolute value for values of a
greater than 1.004.
We conclude from our analysis of the roots that plausible parametrizations of
the FM model display dynamic as well as static indeterminacy and that conclusion
is confirmed by our empirical estimates, described in Section VII, in which we
freely estimate a to be equal to 3.8.
The conjunction of static and dynamic indeterminacy provide two sources of endogenous persistence. Static indeterminacy implies that the output gap contains
an I(1) component. Instead of converging to a point in interest-rate-inflationoutput gap space, the data converge to a one-dimensional linear manifold. Dynamic indeterminacy implies that the fed funds rate, the inflation rate and the
unemployment rate display persistent deviations from this manifold.
The fact that the model displays dynamic indeterminacy allows us to explain
why prices appear to move slowly in data. In response to an increase in the fed

adjustment. Prices are not sticky in the sense that there is a cost or barrier to
price adjustment. They are sticky because people believe, correctly, that future
prices will validate their decision to demand fewer goods and services in response
to an increase in the money interest rate.

The shocks εt are called fundamental and the shocks ηt are non-fundamental. By
exploiting a property of the generalized Schur decomposition (Gantmacher, 2000)
Sims provided an algorithm, GENSYS, that determines if there exists a VAR of
the form
(11)

Xt = Ĉ + G0 Xt−1 + G1 εt ,

such that all stochastic sequences {Xt }∞
t=1 generated by this equation also satisfy the structural model, Equation (9).17 To guarantee that solutions remain
bounded, all of the eigenvalues of G0 must lie inside the unit circle. When a
solution of this kind exists, we refer to it as a reduced form of (9).
GENSYS reports on whether a reduced form exists and, if it exists, whether it is
unique. The algorithm eliminates unstable generalized eigenvalues of the matrices
{Γ0 , Γ1 } by finding expressions for the non-fundamental shocks, ηt , as functions
of the fundamental shocks, εt . When there are too few unstable generalized
eigenvalues, there are many candidate reduced forms.
For the case of multiple candidate reduced forms, Farmer et al. (2015) show how
to redefine a subset of the non-fundamental shocks as new fundamental shocks.
For example, if the model has one degree of indeterminacy, one may define a
vector of expanded fundamental shocks, ε̂t ,

The parameters of the variance-covariance matrix of expanded fundamental shocks

We assume that prices are subject to an independent sunspot shock that is
uncorrelated with the innovations to the other three fundamental shocks. This
assumption forces shocks to the policy rule to be transmitted contemporaneously
to the output gap and it enables the FM model to explain a monetary transmission

mechanism in which nominal shocks are transmitted to prices slowly over time.
To solve and estimate both the NK and FM models, we use an implementation
of GENSYS, (Sims, 2001b) programmed in DYNARE (Adjemian et al., 2011), to
find the reduced form associated with any given point in the parameter space.
We use the Kalman filter to generate the likelihood function and a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo algorithm to explore the posterior.
B.

An Important Implication of the Engle-Granger Representation Theorem

The reduced form of both the NK and FM models is a Vector Autoregression
with the form of Equation (11). We reproduce that equation below.
(11′ )

Xt = Ĉ + G0 Xt−1 + G1 εt .

Robert Engle and Clive Granger (1987) showed how to rewrite a Vector-Autoregression
in the equivalent form
(13)

∆Xt = Ĉ + Π̂Xt−1 + G1 εt ,

where Xt ∈ Rn . If the matrix Π̂ has rank n, this system of equations has a well
defined non-stochastic steady state, X̄, defined by shutting down the shocks and
setting Xt = X̄ for all t. X̄ is defined by the expression,
(14)

X̄ = −Π̂−1 Ĉ.

When Π̂ has rank r < n, it can be written as the product of an n × r matrix α
and an r × n matrix β ⊤ ,
(15)

Π̂ = αβ ⊤ .

The rows of α are referred to as loading factors, and the columns of β are called
co-integrating vectors.18
When Π̂ has reduced rank there is no steady state and in the absence of stochastic shocks the sequence Xt will converge to a point on an n − r dimensional linear
subspace of Rn that depends on the initial condition X0 .
The NK model has a unique steady state and its Engle-Granger representation
leads to a matrix Π̂ with full rank. In contrast, the FM model has multiple steady
states and its Engle-Granger representation leads to a matrix Π̂ with reduced
rank. It follows that the reduced form of the FM model is a VECM as opposed
to a VAR.
18 The co-integrating vectors are not uniquely defined; they are linear combinations of the steady state
equations of the non-stochastic model.

Rt = (1 − ρR )r̄ + ρR Rt−1 + (1 − ρR ) [λπt + µ (yt − zs,t )] + zR,t .

For the NK model these equations are supplemented by the Phillips curve, Equation (3.a),
(3.a)

πt = βEt [πt+1 ] + φ (yt − zs,t ) ,

and for the FM model they are supplemented by the belief function, Equation
(3.b),
(3.b)

Et [xt+1 ] = xt .

We assume in both models that the demand and supply shocks follow autoregressive processes that we model with equations (16) and (17),
(16)

zd,t = ρd zd,t−1 + εd,t ,

(17)

zs,t = ρs zs,t−1 + εs,t .

Figure 2 plots the data that we use to compare the models. We use three time
series for the U.S. over the period from 1954Q3 to 2007Q4: the effective Federal
Funds Rate, the CPI inflation rate and the percentage deviation of real GDP from
a linear trend.
To estimate the models, we used a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm, implemented in DYNARE (Adjemian et al., 2011). Formal tests reject the null of
parameter constancy over the entire period. Beyer and Farmer (2007) find evidence of a break in 1980 and we know from the Federal Reserve Bank’s own
website (of San Francisco, January 2003) that the Fed pursued a monetary targeting strategy from 1979Q3 through 1982Q3. For this reason, and in line with
previous studies (Clarida et al., 2000; Lubik and Schorfheide, 2004; Primiceri,
2005), we estimated both models over two separate sub-periods.
Our first sub-period runs from 1954Q3 through 1979Q2. The beginning date
is one year after the end of the Korean war; the ending date coincides with the
appointment of Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. We

excluded the period from 1979Q3 through 1982Q4 because, over that period, the
Fed was explicitly targeting the growth rate of the money supply. In 1983Q1, it
reverted to an interest rate rule.
Our second sub-period runs from 1983Q1 to 2007Q4. We ended the sample
with the Great Recession to avoid potential issues arising from the fact that the
federal funds rate hit a lower bound in the beginning of 2009 and our linear
approximation is unlikely to fare well for that period.

Table 1.A summarizes the prior parameter distributions that we used in this
procedure for those parameters that were the same in both sub-samples. The table
reports the prior shape, mean, standard deviation and 90% probability interval.
Table 1.B presents the prior distributions for parameters that were different in
the two subsamples. These were λ, the policy coefficient for the interest rate
response to the inflation rate, and σs , the standard deviation of the supply shock.

KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS

We set λ = 0.9 in the first sub-period and λ = 1.1 in the second. We chose these
values because Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) found that policy was indeterminate
in the first period and determinate in the second. These choices ensure that our
priors are consistent with these differences in regimes.
We set the standard deviation of σs to 0.1 in the pre-Volcker sample and 0.01 in
the post-Volcker sample. We made this choice because earlier studies (Primiceri,
2005; Sims and Zha, 2006) found that the variance of shocks was higher in the
post-Volcker sample, consistent with the fact that there were two major oil-price
shocks in this period.
We restricted the parameters of the policy rule to lie in the indeterminacy region
for the pre-Volcker period and the determinacy region for the post-Volcker. Those
restrictions are consistent with Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) who estimated a NK
model, pre- and post-Volcker, and found that the NK model was best described
by an indeterminate equilibrium in the first sub-period. Our priors for a, λ and µ
place the FM model in the indeterminacy region of the parameter space for both
sub-samples.
To identify the NK model in the pre-Volcker period, and for the FM model in
both sub-periods, we chose a pre-determined price equilibrium. We selected that
equilibrium by choosing the forecast error
ηtπ ≡ πt − Et−1 [πt ]
as a new fundamental shock and we identified the variance covariance matrix of
shocks by setting the covariance of ηtπ with the other fundamental shocks, to zero.
The results of our estimates are reported in Tables 2, 3 and 4. Table 2 reports the logarithm of the marginal data densities and the corresponding posterior model probabilities under the assumption that each model has equal prior
probability. These were computed using the modified harmonic mean estimator
proposed by Geweke (1999). In Tables 3 and 4 we present parameter estimates for
the pre-Volcker period (1954Q3-1979Q2) and the post-Volcker period, (1983Q12007).

The dynamic properties of the FM model depend on the value of the parameter
a. We tried restricting this parameter to be less than 1, a restriction that places
the FM model in the determinacy region of the parameter space. We found that
the posterior for a model that imposes this restriction was clearly dominated by
allowing a to lie in the indeterminacy region. In both the FM and NK cases, we
used the approach of Farmer et al. (2015) which allows the econometrician to use
standard software packages to estimate indeterminate models.
Table 3, reports the estimated parameters of both the FM and NK models. For
both of these models, the parameter estimates place the model in the indeterminacy region and, in both cases, we resolved the indeterminacy by selecting an
equilibrium in which the co-variance parameters of shocks to the inflation surprise
with the other fundamentals shocks was set to zero.
Table 4 reports the posterior estimates for the post-Volcker period (1983Q12007Q4). For this sample period, the FM estimates place the model in the region
of dynamic indeterminacy and, once again, we resolved the indeterminacy by
selecting a pre-determined price equilibrium. In contrast, the posterior means of
the NK model satisfy the Taylor Principle, thus guaranteeing that the equilibrium
of NK model is locally unique.

We find differences in the policy parameters r̄, and µ and large significant differences in λ, and ρR . In line with previous studies (Primiceri, 2005; Sims and Zha,
2006), we find that the estimated volatility of the shocks dropped significantly
after the Volcker disinflation.
In Section VIII we provide further insights on the role that these changes played
in affecting the relationship between inflation rate, output gap and nominal interest rate.
VIII.

What Changed in 1980?

There is a large literature that asks: Why do the data look different after the
Volcker disinflation? At least two answers have been given to that question. One
answer, favored by Sims and Zha (2002), is that the primary reason for a change
in the behavior of the data before and after the Volcker disinflation is that the
variance of the driving shocks was larger in the pre-Volcker period. Primiceri
(2005) finds some evidence that policy also changed but his structural VAR is
unable to disentangle changes in the policy rule from changes in the private sector
equations.
Previous work by Canova and Gambetti (2004) explains the reduction in volatility after 1980 as a consequence of better monetary policy. But when Lubik and
Schorfheide (2004) estimate a NK model over two separate sub-periods they find

18

UCLA WORKING PAPER

MARCH 2017

significant difference across regimes, not only in the policy parameters, but also
in their estimates of the private sector parameters. That leads to the following
question. Can the FM model explain the change in the behavior of the data before and after 1980 in terms of a change only in the policy parameters? To answer
that question, we estimated five alternative models. The results are reported in
Table 5.
In Model 1, Fully unrestricted, we estimated all the parameters of the FM model
separately for the two sub-periods. In Model 2, Policy and shocks, we allowed
the variances of the shocks and the parameters of the policy rule to change across
sub-periods, but we constrained the parameters of the IS curve to be the same. In
Models 3, Shocks only, we allowed only the variances of the shocks to change and
in Model 4, we allowed only the Policy Rule parameters to change. Finally, in
Model 5, we restricted all of the parameters to be the same in both sub-periods.

The results in Table 5 indicate that the specification in which policy parameters
and shocks are allowed to differ explains the data almost as well as the fully
unrestricted model specification. But as soon as we restrict either the policy
parameters or the shocks to be the same, the explanatory power of the FM model
drops substantially. With the exception of Model 2, Policy and shocks, all of the
restrictions are clearly rejected.
Why was the post-Volcker regime relatively benign? In line with previous studies, we find that both good policy and good luck had a part to play. The postVolcker period, leading up to the Great Recession, was associated with fewer large
shocks and with no large negative supply shocks of the same order of magnitude
as the oil price shocks of 1973 and 1978. It was also associated with a change in
the policy rule followed by the Fed. What we add to previous studies is a model in
which our estimates of the structural private sector parameters remain invariant
across both regimes. The Fed changed its behavior; households did not.

Conclusions

The FM model gives a very different explanation of the relationship between
inflation, the output gap and the federal funds rate from the conventional NK
approach. It is a model where demand and supply shocks may have permanent
effects on employment and inflation and our empirical findings demonstrate that
this model fits the data better than the NK alternative. The improved empirical
performance of the FM model stems from its ability to account for persistent
movements in the data.
In the FM model, beliefs about nominal income growth are fundamentals of the
economy. Beliefs select the equilibrium that prevails in the long-run and monetary
policy chooses to allocate shocks to permanent changes in inflation expectations
or permanent deviations of output from its trend growth path.
Our findings have implications for the theory and practice of monetary policy.
Central bankers use the concept of a time-varying natural rate of unemployment
before deciding when and if to raise the nominal interest rate. The difficulty of
estimating the natural rate arises, in practice, because the economy displays no
tendency to return to its natural rate. That fact has led to much recent skepticism about the usefulness of the Phillips curve in policy analysis. Although we are
sympathetic to the Keynesian idea that aggregate demand determines employment, we have shown in this paper that it is possible to construct a ‘Keynesian
economics’ without the Phillips curve.

Appendix A: The Reduced Forms of the NK and FM Models

In Appendix A we find solutions to simplified versions of the two models and
we show how they are different from each other. To find closed form solutions, we
set ρ = 0, η = 0, a = 1, r̄ = 0 and ρR = 0. These simplifications allow us to solve
the models by hand using a Jordan decomposition. For more general parameter
values we rely on numerical solutions that we compute using Christopher Sim’s
code, GENSYS Sims (2001b).

Solving the NK Model

Consider the following stripped down version of the NK model
yt
Rt
πt
η1,t
η2,t

=

=

Et [yt+1 ] − (Rt − Et [πt+1 ])
λπt + µyy + zR,t
βEt−1 (πt+1 ) + φyt
yt − Et−1 (yt )
πt − Et−1 (πt )

The model can be written in the following matrix form
(A1)

Γ0 Xt = Γ1 Xt−1 + Ψεt + Πηt ,

where Xt ≡ (yt , πt , Et (yt+1 ), Et (πt+1 ))⊤ , εt = (zR,t ) and ηt = (η1,t , η2,t )⊤ .
Defining the matrix Γ∗1 ≡ Γ−1
0 Γ1 we may rewrite this equation,
(A2)

Xt = Γ∗1 Xt−1 + Ψ∗ εt + Π∗ ηt .

The existence of a unique bounded solution to Equation (A2) requires that two
roots of the matrix Γ∗1 are outside the unit circle. This condition is satisfied when
the following generalized form of the Taylor Pricipal holds,
λ+

µ > 1.

In this case, the reduced form is an equation,
(A3)

Xt = GN K Xt−1 + H N K zR,t

where H N K is a 5 × 1 vector of coefficients and GN K is a 5 × 5 matrix of zeros.
When the Taylor Principle breaks down, one or more elements of the vector of
non-fundamental shocks, ηt , can be reclassified as fundamental. In that case, the

Solving the FM model

The equivalent stripped-down version of the FM model is represented by the
equations,
yt
Rt

Et [yt+1 ] − (Rt − Et [πt+1 ]) ,
λπt + µyt + zR,t ,

yt − yt−1 + πt ,
xt − Et−1 (xt ).

Using the definition of xt and the Taylor Rule to eliminate πt and Rt . this can
be rewritten as a system of three equations in the variables xt , yt and Et [xt+1 ],
Et [xt+1 ] − λxt − (µ − λ)yt = λyt−1 + zR,t
Et [xt+1 ] − xt = 0,
xt = Et−1 (xt ) + ηt .
In matrix notation
Γ0 Xt = Γ1 Xt−1 + Ψεt + Πηt ,
where Xt ≡ (Et [xt+1 ], xt , yt ), εt = (zR,t )⊤ and

When the Taylor Principle holds, the reduced form is an equation of the form

Appendix B: Dynamic Properties for generalized IS curve

We now show that the dynamic properties of the FM model depend not only
on the parameters of the monetary policy reaction function but importantly also
on the parameter of relative risk aversion a. To simplify the notation, we consider
the case of ρR = 0 and proceed to solve the model as in Appendix A. The roots
of the system are λ1 = λ2 = 0, λ3 = 1 and
p
−(λ − µ − a + 1) ± (λ − µ − a + 1)2 + 4λ(a − 1)
.
λ4,5 =
2(a − 1)
Given the posterior mean of the parameter λ = 0.92 and µ = 0.99, we focus on
the approximated roots for (λ − µ) = 0. Thus, we obtain

for realistic values of the parameter λ and a. If (a − 1) > 0, then λ4 > 1. If
(a − 1) < 0, then 0 < λ4 < 1 if and only if 4λ < (1 − a) or equivalently a < 1 − 4λ.
For realistic values of the parameter λ, this is never the case, implying that λ4 is
always an unstable root of the model.
Given that the FM model has two forward-looking

The posterior means reported in Table 3 and 4 for both the pre- and postVolcker period indicate that this condition is violated, and that the dynamic
properties of the FM model crucially depend on the value of the parameter a.
