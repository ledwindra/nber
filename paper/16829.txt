New measures of the costs of unemployment: Evidence from the subjective well-being of
3.3 million Americans

ABSTRACT
Using two large US surveys, we estimate the effects of unemployment on the subjective well-being
of the unemployed and the rest of the population. For the unemployed, the non-pecuniary costs of
unemployment are several times as large as those due to lower incomes, while the indirect effect at
the population level is fifteen times as large. For those who are still employed, a one percentage point
increase in local unemployment has an impact on well-being roughly equivalent to a four percent decline
in household income. We also find evidence indicating that job security is an important channel for
the indirect effects of unemployment.

A growing literature uses data on subjective well-being to study macroeconomic determinants of life quality and relate them to policy discussions. Di
Tella et al. (2001) use self-reported life satisfaction from the Euro-barometer
surveys to estimate the unemployment-inﬂation tradeoﬀ. Wolfers (2003) uses
the same source of data to evaluate the cost of business cycle volatility. Di
Tella et al. (2003) focuses on European style welfare state policies. There is
also an active literature on the social-norm eﬀects of unemployment (Clark,
2003; Clark et al., 2010; Powdthavee, 2007; Shields and Price, 2005; Shields
et al., 2009; Chadi, 2013).
In this paper, we focus on the indirect or spillover eﬀects of unemployment
on the subjective well-being of U.S. residents, especially those who are still
employed. Using two recent large surveys, we estimate the well-being costs of
unemployment separately for diﬀerent segments of the population, and decompose the total cost into monetary and nonmonetary costs of job losses, and
the population-wide indirect eﬀects. The indirect eﬀects in the aggregate are
found to be much larger than the direct eﬀects. This suggests that more precise
estimation and understanding of unemployment’s indirect eﬀects are essential
for any cost-beneﬁt analysis of policies designed to mitigate the economic and
social eﬀects of unemployment.
The two recent surveys we use are the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index
from 2008 to 2011 and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 2005, or in cases from
the early 1990s, to 2010. Both are large daily surveys, giving us a combined
sample of more than 3 million U.S. respondents since 2005. The surveys include
measures of subjective well-being that cover both life evaluations and emotional
reports. The surveys’ ﬁne-grained geographic identiﬁers allow us to relate vari-

1

ations in well-being to local labor market conditions. These two surveys will
add question variety and much sample size and richness to a literature in which
US studies were based mostly on the happiness question in the General Social
Survey (GSS).
In addition to bringing in new survey data and ﬁner-grain unemployment
statistics, we experiment with a variety of identiﬁcation strategies in order to
provide more conclusive evidence and a better understanding on the spillover
eﬀects of unemployment. In the literature, Di Tella et al. (2001) and Wolfers
(2003) ﬁnd signiﬁcantly population-wide negative eﬀects using European and
US survey data. Clark (2003) and Mavridis (2010), focusing on the labour force,
uncover no statistically signiﬁcant eﬀects from the British Household Panel
Study surveys. In this paper we will examine both the sample of employed
workers and the wider population. More importantly, our analysis adopts a
wide range of model speciﬁcations to make use of diﬀerent sources of variations
including those in oﬃcial unemployment statistics, external industrial trends,
unemployment by occupation and workplace downsizing. These experiments
not only help check robustness, but also shed light on the structure and dynamics of the spillover eﬀects of unemployment. In particular, we ﬁnd evidence
that the anticipation of future increases in local unemployment has a negative
impact on the population’s well-being, and that job security is an important
channel underneath the indirect eﬀects.
The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 1 reviews the literature.
Section 2 describes the data and the estimation method. Section 3 presents
empirical ﬁndings. Section 4 concludes.

Literature review

The literature on the macroeconomics of well-being can be traced back to the
seminal paper by Easterlin (1974) showing that the rise of income in the US
since 1946 was not accompanied by an increase in its population’s happiness.
A more recent body of literature starts with Di Tella et al. (2001), which compares the costs of unemployment and inﬂation on happiness, using data from
the Euro-Barometer surveys. It is found that both unemployment and inﬂation
reduce satisfaction but the coeﬃcient on the unemployment rate is almost twice
as large as the coeﬃcient on the rate of inﬂation. Blanchﬂower (2007) also reports that the negative eﬀect of unemployment is greater than that of inﬂation.
Di Tella et al. (2003) expand the study to cover more macroeconomic factors,
and report that both the level of and the changes in GDP have positive eﬀects
on life satisfaction. Also using the Euro-Barometer as the main data source,
Wolfers (2003) extends the literature to include measures of economic volatility
as explanatory variables, and ﬁnds that greater unemployment volatility lowers
well-being.
There is an active literature on the social-norm eﬀect of unemployment,
whereby unemployed individuals may suﬀer less in areas where more people are
unemployed. Clark (2003) ﬁnds from British survey data that that aggregate
unemployment has a greater negative eﬀect on employed workers than it does
on unemployed workers, consistent with the social-norm hypothesis. Clark et al.
(2010) present consistent ﬁndings using the German Socio-Economic Panel, but
also present evidence that the appropriate distinction may be between higher
and lower levels of labour-market security, instead of between employment and
unemployment. Powdthavee (2007) reports ﬁndings consistent with the socialnorm eﬀects using South African survey data. Shields and Price (2005) use
3

data from the Health Survey for England and report that individuals who live
in areas with high degrees of deprivation report lower levels of psychological
well-being, with an inverse u-shape relationship. They also ﬁnd evidence consistent with the social-norm hypothesis. Shields et al. (2009) ﬁnd from Australian
survey data a negative relationship between neighborhood deprivation and individual life satisfaction, though the unemployment rate does not standard out
by itself. Chadi (2013) uses the German Socio-Economic Panel Study to study
the interaction between individual and aggregate unemployment, and draws a
conclusion that is very diﬀerent from the literature, that being unemployed is
more distressing in regions with higher unemployment rates.
The literature using US data is more limited. Di Tella et al. (2001), Di Tella
et al. (2003) and Wolfers (2003) use US data from the General Social Survey
(GSS) in addition to European data. The GSS has interviewed, on average,
1,500 respondents a year since 1972, and has a three-step happiness question
“Taken all together, how would you say things are these days - would you say
that you are very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy?” Di Tella et al. (2001)
ﬁnd that the average happiness in the US is negatively correlated with yearto-year changes in inﬂation and in unemployment. Wolfers (2003) reports that
state-level unemployment rate has a signiﬁcantly negative eﬀect.
Finally, we note a few examples that focus on the negative eﬀects of individual unemployment. They are Winkelmann and Winkelmann (1998) and
Kassenboehmer and Haisken-DeNew (2009). Our focus in this paper is the
indirect eﬀects of unemployment.

Data and the estimation method

2.1

Measures of well-being

Our ﬁrst data source is the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS). The BRFSS is a state-based system of surveys collecting information
on health risk behaviors, preventive health practices, and health care access. It
collects information from more than 350,000 American adults (age 18 and over)
a year in recent years. Starting from 2005, the BRFSS includes a question on
life satisfaction: “In general, how satisﬁed are you with your life?” Respondents
choose one of the following answers: very satisﬁed, satisﬁed, dissatisﬁed, or very
dissatisﬁed. Oswald and Wu (2010) is a recent study that uses this measure of
subjective well-being. As of April 2012, the latest available year is 2010.
As highlighted in Kahneman and Deaton (2010), there are interesting differences between life evaluations (such as the life satisfaction described above)
and reports of emotional experiences. To ensure that our study covers both aspects of well-being, we include an alternative measure from the BRFSS based
on a questions of mental health: “Now thinking about your mental health,
which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, for how many
days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good?” This question
entered the BRFSS in 1993. We start the sample from 1994 in order to have a
consistent set of income categories. About 4 million US residents answered the
question of mental health from 1994 to 2010.
Measured by the two indicators described above, the US population is by
and large happy. Overwhelmingly (93 percent), US residents are satisﬁed or
very satisﬁed with their lives; slightly more choose “satisﬁed” as opposed to
the top category (49 percent to 45). Among the rest, 4.5 percent say they

5

are dissatisﬁed, only 1 percent choose “very dissatisﬁed.” For the measure of
mental health, most Americans (68 percent) say they never have any days in
the past 30 when mental health was not good.
The second survey that we use is the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index,
a daily survey of U.S. residents that interviews about 1,000 adults every day
since 2008. One of its primary measures of subjective well-being is the Cantril
Self-Anchoring Ladder (life ladder or ladder hereafter). It is the response to
the following question: “Please imagine a ladder with steps numbered from
zero at the bottom to ten at the top. Suppose we say that the top of the
ladder represents the best possible life for you, and the bottom of the ladder
represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would
you say you personally feel you stand at this time, assuming that the higher the
step the better you feel about your life, and the lower the step the worse you
feel about it? Which step comes closest to the way you feel?” The response thus
has 11 levels from 0 to 10 in an ascending order, with higher values indicating
better outcomes. From 2008 to 2011 (the latest available data as of April 2012),
the Gallup-Healthways surveys provide a total of 1.4 million observations. 76
percent of them choose 6 or above (the middle rung is 5). The mode is 8 with
a mass of 26 percent; 9 and 10 each accounts for about 9 percent. Among the
rest, 14 percent choose 5, 10 percent choose between 0 and 4.
For measures of emotional well-being, we use a set of questions in the GallupHealthways survey that ask about survey respondents’ experiences the day before the interview. Examples include “Did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday?”
and “Did you experience the following feelings during a lot of the day yesterday? How about worry?” We identify eight questions, primarily based on
availability, that are evenly divided into positive and negative emotions. The

6

four positive emotions are “smile or laugh a lot”, “enjoyment”, “happiness”,
and “learn or do something interesting”. The four negative ones are “worry”,
“sadness”, “stress” and “anger”. From the answers to these questions, we derive a score of positive emotions and a score of negative emotions. Speciﬁcally,
we count the number of “yes” answers to the ﬁrst four questions to reach a positive score. The resulting score has ﬁve steps from 0 to 4. Between 2008 and
2011, 54 percent of the respondents report all four types of positive emotions
and thus have the maximum score of four; 27 percent have a score of three; 14
percent have a score at two or one; only 4 percent report no positive experiences
whatsoever. The negative score is constructed in the same manner based on
the second set of emotions (worry, sadness, stress and anger). About 50 percent
of the respondents report zero negative experience; 20 percent have a score of
one; 14 percent two; 9 percent three; leaving less than 5 percent reporting the
maximum score of four negative emotions.
In addition to the two scores for emotions, we use the same set of emotional reports to construct an indicator for the dominance of negative emotions. It serves as a proxy for the U-index that was introduced in Kahneman
and Krueger (2006), who raise concern about measuring life satisfaction with
numerical scales, because “there is no guarantee that respondents use the scales
comparably” (p. 18). Instead they proposed a U-index (“U” is for “unpleasant” or “undesirable”) to measure the proportion of time an individual spends
in an unpleasant state. The Gallup-Healthways survey does not allow a literal
construction of the index, because it does not record minutes or hours associated with each mood or experience. Instead we construct a proxy by comparing
the score of negative experiences to the score of positive ones. If the negative
score is strictly greater than the positive one, we classify the respondent’s day

7

(before the interview) as an “unpleasant” one in the dichotomous manner advocated in Kahneman and Krueger (2006) and assign the value 1 to the index;
otherwise the index is zero. In the survey, 11 percent of respondents have a
pseudo u-index that is 1.
In total, our analysis makes use of six measures of subjective well-being in
two distinct categories. The life assessment category includes the four-step life
satisfaction and the 11-step life ladder. The emotional experiences category
includes the self-reported number of days when mental health is not good and
the pseudo u-index that indicates the recent dominance of negative emotions
over positive emotions. We also include the positive and negative components
of the pseudo u-index as separate indices in the second category, as they may be
diﬀerentially linked to unemployment and other factors inﬂuencing well-being

2.2

Local and state-level statistics

Unemployment statistics at the county level come from the Local Area Unemployment Statistics program of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). There
were 3,141 counties or equivalents in the 2000 Census; most are included in our
data (more than 3,100 counties in Gallup-Healthways and more than 2,300 in
BRFSS). There are other statistics that serve speciﬁc purposes, such as statelevel unemployment rates, external industrial trends and unemployment rates
by occupation. We will describe those data as they enter the analysis (Table A.1
in the appendix tabulates the sources).

erage happiness and unemployment rates. Figure 1 shows the scatter plots
between the two variables across states over the sample periods. When deriving average happiness, we exclude unemployed workers from the sample. The
purpose is to focus on the indirect eﬀect of unemployment on people who are
not themselves unemployed. The relationships are negative in all cases, all with
conventional statistical signiﬁcance. The correlations are thus consistent with
the hypothesized indirect eﬀects of unemployment.

Next we look at variations over time by plotting the happiness trajectories
according to local labor market conditions. Speciﬁcally, we divide counties into
quartiles according to changes in the unemployment rate from 2007 to 2010.
Those in the top quartile are the hardest hit, those in the bottom quartile the
least aﬀected. We then compare the two groups (top and bottom quartiles)
in the trajectories of their happiness measures. Again, we exclude unemployed
workers from the survey samples.
Figure 2 shows the plots. We note that the happiness measures are rather
stable despite the severity of the recession. This is consistent with the ﬁndings
10

reported in Deaton (2012). But national time-series do not reﬂect the substantial diﬀerences at the local level. Here our hypothesis is that counties that were
the hardest hit during the recession experienced larger declines in well-being
relative to the least aﬀected group. We also note that the average levels of
the survey responses are aﬀected by changes in survey design. Speciﬁc to the
Gallup-Healthways surveys, Deaton (2012) reported that “Life evaluation questions are extremely sensitive to question order eﬀects–asking political questions
ﬁrst reduces reported life evaluation by an amount that dwarfs the eﬀects of
even the worst of the crisis.” The large jump in life ladder after the change in
questionnaire also shows up in Figure 2 in the middle panel on the left-hand
side. In our regression analysis we will use time dummies to remove the impact
of conditioning eﬀects caused by change in questions order or in other aspects
of the surveys.
Back to Figure 2 and the hypothesis that counties that were the hardest
hit fared worse. The evidence is weak in BRFSS but stronger in the GallupHealthways surveys. In the BRFSS, the hardest-hit counties had lower life
satisfaction even before the recession, starting from 2005 when the data became
available. There is no obvious trend for the gap to narrow or widen thereafter.
The BRFSS’s other measure is the number of days with bad mental health.
This measure begins from the early 1990s. Here the evidence is also mixed. In
the 1990s the two groups are quite similar in this happiness measure. But the
two began to diverge around 2003. Since then there is a statistically signiﬁcant
gap between the two groups in the expected direction; but the timing appears
to be oﬀ.
There is stronger evidence in the Gallup-Healthways survey. For the Cantril
ladder, the pseudo u-index and the index of positive emotions, there is little

11

diﬀerence between the top and bottom groups in early 2008. A statistically
signiﬁcant gap, in the expected direction and consistent with the negative impact of unemployment, emerged in late 2008, at the onset of the ﬁnancial crisis.
The evidence is weaker for the index of negative emotions. According to this
measure, the hardest-hit counties always fare worse than the better-oﬀ group
even in early 2008. But the diﬀerence widens somewhat during the economic
crisis, consistent with the hypothesized impact of unemployment.
To summarize the observations from the correlations reported above, both
surveys, the BRFSS and the Gallup-Healthways, show strong cross-sectional
correlations that are consistent with unemployment’s negative impact on the
happiness of people who are not themselves unemployed. The evidence is less
clear cut in terms of dynamic relationships. Consistent observations are made
in the Gallup-Healthways data, but not in the BRFSS. Our later regression
analysis will try to control for relevant factors at the individual and local levels.
Next we examine the relationship between subjective well-being and income,
which plays an important role in our analysis. We will express the estimated
eﬀect of unemployment in terms of income equivalents, i.e., the amount of
monetary gains or losses that have the same eﬀect on well-being as would a
one-percent higher unemployment rate.1
Figure 3 plots the income-happiness relationship. The top panels are for life
satisfaction and mental health from the BRFSS, both plotted against the logarithm of household income. Life satisfaction increases steadily and linearly with
log income over the entire range. The measure of mental health also rises with
1

Both BRFSS and Gallup-Healthways collect their income information as household income in categories. We turn the information into continuous values by estimating a monetary
value for each category, assuming that the overall income distribution is lognormal. We do
so for each individual year to allow the midpoint to grow over time. We then smooth the
year-speciﬁc estimates using three-year moving averages centering on the current year, before
turning them into constant 2010 dollars using the Consumer Price Index.

log income, but the relation is stronger at lower levels of income and weakens as
income rises. This distinction between life evaluative measures and emotional
well-being is similar to those reported in Kahneman and Deaton (2010) based
on the Gallup-Healthways surveys. They found that while the life ladder has
a positive and relatively steady relation with log income, the relationship between emotional well-being and income ﬂattens out after an annual household
income of $75,000. In the BRFSS, there does not appear to be a satiation point
even for the measure of mental health. Figure 3 also plots the four measures of
well-being in the Gallup survey against log income. They are similar to those
in Kahneman and Deaton (2010): life ladder has a positive relation with log income throughout, while emotional well-being increases little, if at all, at higher
levels of income.
We note that there is uncertainty on whether or not the cross-sectional cor13

relations between income and SWB truly reﬂect income’s eﬀect on happiness.
There are possibilities for both upward and downward biases. First, if SWB
adapts to income changes over time, the eﬀects of income would be stronger
in the short run than in the long run. The cross-sectional correlations are
more likely to pick up the weaker longer-term relationships, and thus to underestimate the short-run impact. In the opposite direction, there may be omitted
factors in the regressions that are common to both higher income and better
happiness outcomes. This will lead to over-estimation of the income eﬀect.
Despite the uncertainty, we use the income-equivalent representation for two
reasons. First, the income-equivalents provide a standardized representation
of estimated eﬀects across multiple measures of well-being that have diﬀerent
scales (0 or 1, 1 to 4 and 0 to 10). Without a standardized scale, we would not
be able to evaluate whether or not the estimated eﬀects are comparable across
the six measures of well-being. Secondly, the positive relationship between income and SWB is one of the most robust ﬁndings in the happiness research and
is relatively well-known (Kahneman and Deaton, 2010). An income-equivalent
presentation is thus a relatively easy-to-understand choice of standardization.
In addition, we hope that the income equivalents can provide some indication,
crude and imperfect as it may be, of the economic importance of unemployment’s spillover eﬀects.
Finally, we note that detailed summary statistics are in the appendix.

2.4

Estimation method

We employ a two-level regression approach for our analysis, using both individual and contextual information to predict individual well-being. The most
important contextual variable is the county-level unemployment rate at the

14

time of interview. The following equation describes the basic estimation, or
Model-1.

w(i,t),j = α0 ln(y(i,t) ) + X(i,t) α1 + β0 urj,t + Zj,t β1 + Dt β2 + u(i,t)
The dependent variable w(i,t),j is the well-being measure of worker i in county
j who is interviewed at time t. In the subscript, we use a parenthesis to enclose
i and t to highlight the fact that the surveys are not longitudinal. The time
subscript t is in the unit of quarters.
The ﬁrst variable on the right-hand side is the logarithm of household income, or ln(y(i,t) ).2 The vector X(i,t) has all other personal and demographic
information including age categories, gender, marital status, educational attainment, race and labor force status. The variable urj,t is the unemployment
rate in county j at time t. The vector Zj,t has other county-level information,
including the log of average household income, the log of population density,
the urbanization rate, the racial composition of each county’s population, the
percentage of owner-occupied housing (to measure the stability of population),
and the longitude and latitude of the geographic centroid. It also includes
2

We turn categorical income information into continuous values under the assumption
that the income follows a log-normal distribution. We then assign the estimated mid-point
value to each of the income categories. The midpoint estimate is likely to be less accurate
for open-ended brackets, so we add to the regressions a dummy indicator for the top income
category. We did not include a dummy indicator for the lowest income category, because the
respondents in the bottom category are either few in number (in BRFSS) or removed before
regressions (in Gallup-Healthways; more later on this). The top bracket presents a greater
concern because it has a much larger concentration of survey respondents. The BRFSS’s top
bracket starts from $75, 000 in annual terms and includes about a quarter of the respondents
in recent years. The Gallup-Healthways survey’s top bracket starts from $120, 000 in annual
terms and includes about 10 percent of the respondents. Following Kahneman and Deaton
(2010), we deleted respondents in the Gallup-Healthways survey whose reported monthly
incomes are lower than $500, as such values are unlikely to be serious estimates of household
income. The lowest BRFSS income bracket is $10, 000 a year or below; it includes about 4%
of the sample in recent years. We keep those observations in our analysis. Both surveys have
non-trivial portions of respondents with missing income information (about 10-20 percent).
We include a dummy indicator for missing income in all regressions.

15

dummy indicators for Alaska and Hawaii, so that the longitude and latitude
variables reﬂect diﬀerences within the continental U.S. Finally, we include a set
of year-quarter dummies Dt to capture time trends as well as possible framing
eﬀects due to changes in the survey questionnaires.
We estimate Model-1 with ordered Probit for all measures of well-being except for the number of days when mental health is not good, which is estimated
linearly. All estimations use weights from the surveys and allow errors to cluster
at the county level.
Besides the basic model, we employ a set of alternative speciﬁcations for robustness and experiments. We run a horse race between state-level employment
rates and county-level statistics, and ﬁnd the latter to have closer correlations
with subjective well-being. Other tests are listed below; we will provide more
details as the analysis proceeds.
• Model-2 focuses on changes in unemployment rates instead of their levels.
• Model-3 uses ﬁxed eﬀects models to remove unobserved local characteristics.
• Model-4 uses instrumental variables (IV) to remove unobserved local characteristics.
• Model-5 adds regional dummies to remove inter-regional correlations between happiness and unemployment rates.
• Model-6 uses occupational-speciﬁc unemployment rates to explore job
security as a channel responsible for unemployment’s indirect eﬀects.
We report estimates from the full-sample and, separately, the sample of
employed workers. All regressions on the full sample control for respondents’
16

own unemployment status so that the local unemployment rate picks up the
indirect eﬀect. The BRFSS provides an indicator of unemployed persons in
all years. The Gallup-Healthways poll, however, changed its questions on labor market activity, starting from the second quarter of 2009, to match the
unemployment deﬁnition in the Current Population Survey (CPS), creating a
hurdle for identifying the unemployed in a consistent manner over time. We
follow the CPS-based deﬁnition when the information is available. For the period before the second quarter of 2009, we deﬁne the unemployed as all those
who are not working for pay, self-employed, full-time students, retired, home
makers or disabled. This approach likely under-counts unemployment, because
some of the people who are studying or working at home will be classiﬁed as
being unemployed under the CPS deﬁnition if they are actively looking for
work. Indeed, the national unemployment rate in 2008 that we calculated in
the Gallup-Healthways is only 3.8%, while it is 5.8% in the CPS. In contrast,
the two sources generate almost-identical estimates of the unemployment rate
in 2010 (9.7% and 9.6%, respectively). For our interest in unemployment’s indirect eﬀect, under-counting unemployment poses a challenge as it may inﬂate
the estimated indirect eﬀects. Fortunately, we can use our separate regressions
that use only the sample of employed workers, thereby avoiding the need to
identify unemployed individuals. The sub-sample regressions also highlight our
interest on the indirect eﬀects of unemployment.

county-level average household income, population density, share of urban population, of
owner-occupied housing, of black residents, of Hispanic residents, and of other minorities,

while higher household income and higher levels of educational attainment are
linked to higher well-being. Married couples are happier than the never-married
singles, while the never-married are happier than the divorced, separated, or
widowed. There is a robust U-shape in age, with happiness falling as age rises
before picking up again in later years. Men report lower life satisfaction and
life ladder than females, while women tend to report higher scores of emotional
experiences in both the positive and negative directions.
We use county-level unemployment (as a fraction of the labor force) to
capture the indirect eﬀects of unemployment. The coeﬃcients on county-level
unemployment are consistently negative across all of our measures of subjective
well-being. They are all statistically signiﬁcant at the conventional levels (1%
or 5%). Tables 2 expresses the estimated indirect eﬀects as monetary equivalents that are constructed as ratios of coeﬃcients, with estimates from the
basic model presented in the column labeled as Model (1). In our estimations,
unemployment is in fractional terms, while household income is in logarithms.
The ratio of the unemployment coeﬃcient to that on log income is thus the
monetary equivalent, in logs, for a fractional unit change in the unemployment
variable. In turn, this means that the ratio of coeﬃcients is the percentage income equivalent for a one percentage point change in the unemployment rate.
The ﬁrst column of Tables 2 shows the income equivalents from the basic
model; they range from 2.7% to 4.2% in the full sample, and 2.7% to 6.3% in
the sample of the employed. The point estimates from the employed sample
tend to be are higher than those from the full sample in 5 of the 6 measures of
well-being, indicating that labor market conditions may have weaker impacts
on those outside the labor force, although in most cases the results are driven
by a smaller estimated income eﬀect among the working sample (i.e., a smaller

The table shows the estimated coeﬃcients on the unemployment-rate variables of interest

In models 1, 3, 4 and 5, the unemployment variable of interest is the level of local

the change in local unemployment rate from same quarter last year. In model 6, the
unemployment variable is the occupation-speciﬁc unemployment rate.

denominator in the calculation of the equivalent income). There are not obvious
patterns of diﬀerences between the evaluative measures (life satisfaction and life
ladder) and the four measures of emotional reports. Take the life ladder and

20

the pseudo u-index as an example: the estimates are similar and within two
standard errors of each other. The average from the ﬁrst four measures (leaving
out the two components of the u-index) is 3.3% for the full sample and 3.8%
for the sample of employed workers.
Our ﬁrst robustness test is to repeat the regressions but with unemployment
rates at the state level added as an extra variable, in addition to the countylevel unemployment rate. This test serves two purposes. First, it presents
a horse race between the two unemployment rates to see which one is more
closely related to the measures of well-being. Secondly, it detects potential
spillover eﬀects from state-level unemployment beyond those at the local level.
The results, presented in the appendix as the ﬁrst panels of Tables A.7 and
A.8, suggest that county-level unemployment tends to have a tighter statistical
relationship with subjective well-being. In 9 out of the 12 regressions, the estimated coeﬃcients on county-level unemployment are statistically signiﬁcant,
compared to 3 in the case of state-level unemployment. Importantly, however,
we ﬁnd that the state-level unemployment rates almost all have the same sign
as the county-level unemployment rate. In most cases, other than the emotional reports in the Gallup-Healthways, they have roughly similar magnitude
to those at the county level. Such ﬁndings are indicative of important spillover
eﬀects from statewide unemployment: it exerts a negative impact on well-being
on a scale comparable to that of county-level unemployment.
The next model, labeled as Model-2 in Tables 2, intends to shed light on
the dynamic aspects of unemployment’s indirect eﬀects. It does so by treating
recent increases in unemployment rates separately from the levels. If the population has a tendency to adapt gradually to a higher level of unemployment, a
recent increase in unemployment likely has a greater impact on well-being than

21

the level per se. Speciﬁcally, we break time-t unemployment rate into a base
component urj,t−4 (where t − 4 is the same quarter last year), and a change
component, ∆urj,t = urj,t − urj,t−4 . The regressions then include both ∆urj,t
and urj,t−4 on the right-hand side. Our interest is in the change component;
the base serves as a control. Tables A.7 and A.8 present the estimated coefﬁcients on both components, while the second column in Table 2 presents the
income equivalents only for the change components ∆urj,t . In all cases, recent
increases in unemployment rates are negatively linked to well-being. The estimated eﬀects are mostly statistically signiﬁcant, except when life satisfaction
in the BRFSS is the dependent variable, in which case it is the lagged unemployment rate that has strong statistical signiﬁcance with the expected sign.
In terms of magnitudes, the eﬀects of recent changes tend to be greater than
estimates based on the level of unemployment rates (the ﬁrst column); but the
conﬁdence intervals overlap in all cases. The evidence for adaptation is thus
indicative but not overwhelming.
The next two models both deal with possible concerns about unobserved
local characteristics. The ﬁndings described above are based on variations in
unemployment rates and happiness at the county level. A concern is that
there are unobserved local characteristics responsible for both unemployment
and (un)happiness. We deal with this concern using both ﬁxed eﬀects and
instrumental-variables (IV) models. The ﬁxed-eﬀect model eliminates all crosscounty variations, including any unobserved ones. The IV approach uses variations that are clearly driven by labor market ﬂuctuations.
The third column of Table 2, labeled as Model-3, has the income equivalents from the ﬁxed eﬀects models. Tables A.7 and A.8 show the underlying

22

estimates.3 The income equivalents from the ﬁxed eﬀects models are clearly
weaker than those from the basic model. In the BRSS, none of the estimates
is signiﬁcant. In the Gallup-Healthways survey, only 4 of the 8 estimates are
signiﬁcant at conventional levels, with a ﬁfth one having a 10% borderline signiﬁcance. The size of the income equivalents are also smaller than those from
previous models. Among the conventionally-signiﬁcant estimates, they range
from 2.3% to 3.7%, just slightly over half of their counterparts from the basic
model in column 1.
A ﬁxed-eﬀects model is not a costless way to handle unobserved factors.
In a short time horizon, it has diﬃculty distinguishing stable local ﬁxed eﬀects
from the well-being consequences of a persistent increase in unemployment that
occurred before the sample period. Our samples indeed have short horizons:
ﬁve of the six well-being measures have a sample period of either 4 or 6 years.
Fixed-eﬀects models are also vulnerable to what we call the anticipation eﬀect,
when future increases in unemployment are foreseen and such predictions reduce
today’s well-being (more discussion of this later).
An IV approach is another way to deal with the problem of omitted variables. We will instrument county-level unemployment rates with observable
features in the labor market while leaving out the residuals including any unobserved components. Compared to the ﬁxed-eﬀects model, the IV approach
3

We switch to linear models in order to take advantage of STATA’s built-in command
to handle large dummy-variable sets (about 3000 counties in our case). The choice is also
motivated by the incidental parameters problem that renders ﬁxed eﬀects probit models
inconsistent. The choice of linear vs probit models makes little qualitative diﬀerence in SWB
regressions, as documented in Ferrer-i-Carbonell and Frijters (2004). But it does mean that
the estimates in Tables A.7 and A.8 for the ﬁxed eﬀects models are not strictly comparable
to those from the probit models. The income equivalents in Table 2, on the other hand, are
comparable as they are expressed as income equivalents (or ratio of coeﬃcients). Ratios of
coeﬃcients are robust to the choice of probit or linear models, because switching from one
to the other tends to aﬀect estimated coeﬃcients proportionally (see Helliwell and Huang
(2009)).

23

allows us to keep using parts of the cross-county variation that are clearly driven
by labor-market ﬂuctuations. Speciﬁcally, we calculate the time series of likely
employment losses for individual counties based on their shares of employment
by industry and external state-wide employment losses by industry. We then
use the contemporaneous and lagged likely losses to instrument for local unemployment rates in standard two-stage regressions. This approach leaves out
unobserved local characteristics except for those that are correlated with local
compositions of industries or with statewide loss of employment by industries,
the only two pieces of information used in the IV approach.4
We implement the IV approach using the industry classiﬁcation at the level
of 11 supersectors deﬁned in the BLS.5 The current likely loss and its three
year lags, namely LikelyLossRatej,s,t−k for k = 0, 4, 8, 12, are then used as instruments in a two-stage least squares IV regressions. These likely employment
losses are strong predictors of county-level unemployment rates: even without
any co-variates, the likely losses explain 42% of the variation in the county-level
unemployment rates since 2005.

Formally, the likely rate of employment losses from the same quarter last year (i.e., from
t − 4 to t) in county j of state s is

The loss rate is expressed as a fraction. The denominator on the right-hand side is the total
employment in the county j at t−4, expressed as the number of employed workers N summed
across industry x. The numerator is the likely employment losses, summed across industries.
The likely losses are in turn the product of two factors: one is the proportional employment
losses by state and industry (excluding the inﬂuence of county j); the other the number of
workers by industry in county j in the base period. We note that the subscription −j in the
numerator means that we exclude county j when calculating the state-wide industrial trend

We label the IV model as Model-4 in Table 2 for the income equivalents.
Tables A.7 and A.8 have the underlying estimates, where 11 of the 12 indirect eﬀects are signiﬁcant at conventional levels. As income equivalents, they
tend to be greater than those from the basic model, particularly so in the sample of employed workers. For example, local unemployment’s impact on life
satisfaction in the basic speciﬁcation is 2.7% in the working samples. The corresponding IV estimate is 4.8%. In the case of life ladder, the estimated eﬀect
jumps from 4.4% to 8.2% with no overlap in the conﬁdence intervals. The contrast is even greater between the IV estimates and the ﬁxed-eﬀects estimates
in column Model-3.6
Why are the IV estimates greater than those estimates based on the actual
unemployment rates? Two likely explanations are adaptation and anticipation.
By adaptation, we mean that recent employment losses have greater impacts
on well-being than the level, because people are able to adjust to higher unemployment; those who cannot adjust may choose to migrate. For those who
remain on their jobs, the adaptation may in part reﬂect a lower threat of job
losses compared to the period when unemployment is rising. Psychologists regard threat as a cause of “a drawn-out process of appraisal and reappraisal”
leading to the feelings of helplessness and confusion (Lazarus and Folkman,
6

There is a diﬀerence in sample period between the IV model and other models; but that
sample period is not responsible for the observed pattern of diﬀerence in estimates. The IV
model (column Molde-4 ) does not include 2011 data, because as of April, 2012, the necessary
QCEW full-year data are not yet available. This is not a concern for the BRFSS data, since
its sample period ends with 2010. For the Galllup-Healthways data, Model-1 and Model-3
are based on the 2008-2011 sample; the IV model uses the 2008-2010 sample. We can remove
the diﬀerence in sample periods by running Model-1 and Model-3 using only the 2008-2010
data. From such regressions, the estimated income equivalents among employed workers is
4.3% in the case of life ladder, 4.5% for the u-index, 5.8% for the positive emotions and
3.4% for negative emotions. In the ﬁxed-eﬀects model, they are 1.6%, 2.2%, 3.8% and 0.07%,
respectively. Without exception, they are either smaller or similar to those from the 4-year
estimates. As a result, they are all substantially smaller than the IV estimates, the pattern
of diﬀerence that we focus on.

1984, p. 92). A stabilization of unemployment, even if it is to a still-high level,
can be beneﬁcial for those who are still employed. This is a hypothesis that is
supported in a previous robustness test, shown in Model-2, that indicating the
negative SWB eﬀects of recent rises in unemployment tend to be greater than
those estimated based on contemporaneous levels of unemployment. Anticipation is about the threat of job losses in the immediate future. One of our later
analyses shows that working in a company that is downsizing is more damaging
to the emotional measures of SWB than is actually being unemployed. This is
also consistent with psychologists’ emphasis in the anticipatory aspect of threat
(see chapter 2 of Lazarus, 1966, for discussions and evidence). The instruments
we use are predicted employment losses based on local industry shares and
the wider area’s employment trends. They very likely can predict a county’s
employment trends in the near future better than the current unemployment
rate. Indeed, in a panel of county-level unemployment rates, our instruments
(namely LikelyLossRatej,s,t−k for k = 0, 4, 8, 12) predict the unemployment
rises over the next year (namely, urj,s,t+4 − urj,s,t ) with an r-squared of 23% in
the 1990-2010 period (48% in the 2005-2010 period). The current employment
rate’s predictive power is much poorer with an r-squared that is 3% and 6% in
those two periods, respectively. If the anticipation of future employment losses
has a negative eﬀect on well-being, we should expect the IV estimates to be
greater than those from the basic model.
The anticipation eﬀect can also explain why the estimates from the ﬁxedeﬀects models are weak: if the anticipation eﬀect is substantial, the ﬁxed-eﬀects
estimates are misleading. Consider a sample with a short time horizon (a small
number of years). Let’s say a county’s unemployment rate rises substantially
from the early years to the later years. The ﬁxed-eﬀect estimations will take

26

an average of the two periods’ unemployment rates and treat it as the county’s
long-term unemployment level. The earlier period is the “good” time because
its unemployment rate is low; the latter period the “bad” time. But the anticipation eﬀect concentrates more in the earlier period, when the residents can
see that the bad times are coming based on industrial trends. The fear is in
fact stronger in the “good” time. The anticipation eﬀect thus weakens the relationship between current employment rates and well-being in the ﬁxed-eﬀect
models. The larger is the anticipation eﬀect, the weaker are the estimates from
the ﬁxed-eﬀect models. Finally, we note that a strong anticipation eﬀect is
consistent with job security being an important channel behind the indirect
eﬀect of unemployment. When workers expect possible job losses in the future,
the weakened sense of job security lowers well-being. After the employment
losses actually take place, however, the still-employed workers may sense an
improvement in their job security and thus experience a recovery in well-being.
Later we will present analysis that focuses on the job security channel.
There is one more potential explanation for why county ﬁxed-eﬀect models
return lower estimates: regional diﬀerences in happiness that are correlated
with unemployment. County-level dummies variables remove local eﬀects and
thus regional diﬀerences as well. What are the likely causes of regional diﬀerences? Some of those may have to do with diﬀerences in population density,
urban shares, and race/ethnic composition. Our basic model already has those
control variables, in addition to average income, longitude, latitude and others.
The model can thus handle systemic regional diﬀerences due to the observed
factors. Problems arise, however, from unobserved or omitted factors. We can
address this concern by adding regional dummy variables to the model, which
will remove unemployment-happiness correlations between regions. Speciﬁcally,

27

we use the Census Bureau’s deﬁnition of regions: Northeast, Midwest, South
and West. There are substantial diﬀerences in unemployment rates among regions. In 2009, for example, the population-weighted unemployment rate was
8.4 percent in the Northeast, 9.7 percent in the Midwest, 8.9 percent in the
south and 10.1 percent in the West.
We report the test results in Model (5) of Tables 2. The appendix Tables A.7 and A.8 show the underlying estimates. Adding regional dummies
does indeed lower the estimates for unemployment’s indirect eﬀect, indicating
that the inter-region correlations between unemployment and happiness are
steeper than those within regions. Almost all estimated income equivalents retain strong statistical signiﬁcance, with only a few in the BRFSS dropping to
the borderline signiﬁcance of 10 percent conﬁdence level. Quantitatively, the
estimated income equivalents fall by an average of a quarter in the full sample,
and a third in the sample of employed workers. The estimates now range from
1.2 percent to 4.4 percent with an average of 2.4 percent in the full sample and
2.8 percent in the sample of employed workers.
A more drastic way to control for regional diﬀerences would be to add state
dummy indicators, thereby eliminating all inter-state correlations in well-being
and unemployment. We decide against this approach for two reasons. First,
inter-state variations account for a large proportion of the diﬀerences in unemployment rates. In 2009, 56 percent of the variation in the county-level
unemployment rates is among states. Second, excluding inter-state diﬀerences
ignores the potential spillover eﬀects from statewide unemployment on happiness. One of our earlier tests provides indicative evidence of the statewide
spillover eﬀect. It uses regressions that include both county-level unemployment rate and state-level unemployment rate on the right-hand side as pre-

28

dictors. The state-level unemployment rate has an additional contribution to
the dependent variables on top of those from county unemployment. In most
cases, the state-level eﬀects are comparable in magnitude to the county-level
eﬀects. Removing the state-level spillover eﬀect thus is thus likely to weaken
the link between unemployment and happiness. However, we should note that
even with the state-level dummies, we still ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant estimates in the Gallup-Healthways that ranges from 1.5 to 4.6 percent in terms
of income equivalent, with an average of 1.9 percent in the full sample and 3
percent in the sample of employed workers. In the BRFSS, however, all estimates lose statistical signiﬁcance and are quantitatively small (see appendix
Tables A.9 and A.10). We note that there are more counties in the GallupHealthways surveys than in the BRFSS (3100 counties versus 2300) and thus
more variation across counties within states. Another possible explanation is
that happiness-unemployment correlations over time are lower in the BRFSS
than in the Gallup-Healthways, as shown by Figure 2.

The job-security channel behind the indirect eﬀect
Why does local unemployment, or the anticipation of its increase, reduce subjective well-being? One likely channel is job security: rises in local unemployment lead to fear of losing one’s own job.7 But there are other possibilities.
Higher unemployment may lead to deterioration of social conditions such as
more crime.8 Rapid reshuﬄing in the labor-market can be disruptive in the
7

A recent paper, Luechinger et al. (2010), tries to disentangle the eﬀects by comparing the
well-being of public-sector workers, who have greater job security, to that of private-sector
workers. They ﬁnd that the former are less aﬀected by high levels of unemployment. Such
ﬁndings are certainly consistent with the job-security channel. See also Clark et al. (2010).
8
The evidence linking crime to unemployment is mixed. At least one study, Raphael and
Winter-Ember (2001), using defense contracts and state-speciﬁc exposure to oil shocks to
instrument for unemployment rates, found signiﬁcantly positive eﬀects of unemployment on
property crime. On the other hand, US crime rates continued their downward trend during

29

short run. While it is not easy to disentangle the mixture, our reasoning above
suggests an important role for the job-security channel. In this section, we
present further relevant observations regarding the job-security channel.
We recognize that the estimated eﬀect of local unemployment is a mixture
of the eﬀects of lower job security (fear of job losses due to a bad local economy)
and of other local channels (say social disruption). The local unemployment
rate alone cannot tell them apart. We need variations that are related to job security but are not local in nature. The unemployment rate by occupation meets
these criteria. It is linked to job security. It may have some correlations with
local unemployment due to industrial clustering. In a manufacturing recession,
for example, residents in manufacturing regions face higher local unemployment
rates and on average higher levels of occupation-speciﬁc unemployment rates.
But we can deal with these correlations by controlling for local labor market
conditions. If the orthogonal part of the occupational rate aﬀects well-being,
we attribute that particular impact to job security instead of local factors.
Below we conduct the exercise using the Gallup-Healthways survey, which
classiﬁes workers into 11 occupation categories.9 The quarterly time series
of occupation-speciﬁc unemployment rates are from the Current Population
Surveys (CPS). We cannot do the same for the BRFSS, which does not identify
the Great Recession. The 2010 FBI Uniformed Crime Report indicates that property crimes
in the US fell from 9.8 million in 2008 to just above 9 million in 2010. Even though national
ﬁgures cannot reveal local heterogeneities, it does raise questions about the importance of
business cycles in crime trends.

occupations. We run the regressions only on the sample of employed workers,
as unemployment by occupation is less relevant for people outside the labor
force.
The last column in Table 2 presents the income equivalents for the occupational unemployment rate. The appendix tables A.8 shows the underlying
estimates. In all regressions, local unemployment has negative and signiﬁcant
eﬀects on employed workers’ well-being. The occupational rate has similar
eﬀects on the life ladder and the pseudo u-index, as well as the positive component of the u-index. For the negative emotions, however, a higher occupational
rate leads to a reduction instead of an increase. But this beneﬁcial impact is
small and is completely overwhelmed by the reductions in positive emotions.
As a result, a higher occupational unemployment rate signiﬁcantly increases the
pseudo u-index, or the chance that the positive emotions become dominated.
In term of income equivalents in Table 2, the occupation-based estimates are
broadly comparable to county-based estimates. For the life ladder, the comparison is 4.8% for the occupational rate and 4.4% for the county rate in column
1. For the pseudo u-index, it is 4.1% to 4.7%. In both cases, the conﬁdence
intervals overlap.
There is broad similarity between the occupation-based estimates and the
county-based estimates. The job security channel is present in both estimates.
If our assumption is right, that the occupational rates aﬀect well-being only
through the job security channel, the quantitative similarity would then suggest
that job security is the major driver behind local unemployment rate’s indirect
eﬀect on well-being.
Our ﬁnal test attempts to provide direct evidence on the well-being impact
of job security. It uses a Gallup-Healthways survey question: “Based on what

31

you know or have seen, would you say that, in general, your company or employer is hiring new people and expanding the size, not changing the size of
its workforce, and letting people go and reducing the size.” In regressions that
are otherwise identical to model (1), we ﬁnd that workforce downsizing, relative to “not changing the size of its workforce”, has substantial negative eﬀect
on employed workers’ well-being. Workforce expansion, on the other hand, is
associated with greater happiness. Appendix Table A.11 reports the estimates.
The coeﬃcients on the dummy indicators of downsizing and expanding are statistically signiﬁcant in all cases. In terms of magnitude, the negative eﬀects of
downsizing are close to or exceed the impact from lowering the log of income by
an entire unit. These extremely large estimated impacts are probably due to
the immediacy of the danger of job losses. For the three measures of emotional
reports, the impact of downsizing is greater than that of actual unemployment
(in terms of income equivalents compared to their counterparts found in the
baseline regressions). The fear of job losses thus seems to be more detrimental
than the actual status of unemployment. This is not true for life evaluations,
for which the actual unemployment status hurts more than does downsizing.
Overall, the two tests above demonstrate that job security is an important
channel for the spillover eﬀect of unemployment. This is also consistent with the
emphasis and ﬁnding in Clark et al. (2010), which ﬁnd that regional unemployment has stronger negative eﬀects for men with higher levels of labour-market
security, and weaker ones for those who already fare poorly in the labour market.

32

Accounting for the well-being impacts of unemployment
The analysis above focuses on indirect eﬀects, but unemployment also has direct
eﬀects on the unemployed. This section decomposes unemployment’s inﬂuence
on the subjective well-being of a population into three parts. The direct monetary cost is the loss of well-being due to income losses from unemployment.
The direct nonpecuniary cost is the further loss of well-being suﬀered by those
who become unemployed. The indirect cost is the loss suﬀered by those who are
not themselves unemployed. We conduct the exercise using estimates from the
basic speciﬁcation (Model-1 ), which generates estimates that are either smaller
or similar to the IV model. Adding regional dummies tends to reduce the indirect eﬀects by about one third. But estimates from other speciﬁcations, based
on recent changes, IV and occupational unemployment rates, tend to generate
higher estimates. The baseline estimates thus present a reasonable median case.
The estimates for the direct eﬀects, on the other hand, are relatively invariant
to model speciﬁcations when expressed in proportion to the eﬀect of income on
well-being.
To evaluate the direct costs on the unemployed themselves, we ﬁrst estimate the reduction in income associated with unemployment by regressing the
log of household income on personal unemployment status, together with all
the covariates in Tables 1 that include gender, age, education, race and others. In the BRFSS data, personal unemployment status has a coeﬃcient of
-0.36 in the income equation, indicating a 43% income diﬀerence between the
unemployed and others with similar characteristics. In the Gallup-Healthways
survey, the estimated diﬀerence is 0.34 in logs or 40%. These estimate are likely
higher-end estimates of the income losses from unemployment, as there could
be unobserved factors responsible for a lower level of income as well as a higher
33

chance of being unemployed. This potential bias strengthens our later argument
that monetary loss is a small part of the costs of unemployment. How does the
lower income aﬀect well-being? The log income’s per-unit eﬀects on well-being
are reported in Tables 1. For life satisfaction, the eﬀect is 0.2. A 0.36 reduction
in log income has a negative impact of 0.36*0.2=0.072. The well-being equation
in Tables 1 also shows the coeﬃcient on personal unemployment status. Those
coeﬃcients measure the nonpecuniary eﬀect of personal unemployment, since
the income variable is already controlled for. For life satisfaction, personal unemployment’s coeﬃcient is -0.4. The ratio of nonpecuniary to pecuniary eﬀects
from personal unemployment is thus 0.4/0.072=5.6.10
There is an extra pecuniary eﬀect on other household members of the newly
unemployed. A job loss reduces household income, and hence negatively aﬀects
all members of the household according to our model speciﬁcation. The average household size is 2.58 according to the 2010 Census Briefs. So there is a
1.58 times additional monetary eﬀects on SWB through the within-household
spillover eﬀects.
To evaluate the indirect cost at the population level, we use the estimated
coeﬃcients on local unemployment in Tables 1. In the life satisfaction equation,
local unemployment has a coeﬃcient of -0.59. The indirect cost of a one percentage point increase in unemployment is thus 0.59*1 percent. Since the US
labor force participation rate is about 65 percent, a 1 percent increase in the
unemployment rate moves 0.65 percent of the population from the employment
pool to the unemployment pool. The direct well-being loss due to monetary
10

Our approach does not distinguish between temporary and permanent eﬀects of income
changes from unemployment. Knabe and Ratzel (2011) suggest that not making such distinction leads to overestimating the nonpecuniary costs of unemployment by about one-third.
But because the nonpecuniary costs in our data are on average several times as big as the
monetary costs, adjusting the estimates downward by one third would not change the picture
substantially.

34

losses, as calculated before, is 0.072 individually and thus 0.072*0.65 at the aggregate. The direct nonpecuniary eﬀect is 0.4 individually and 0.4*0.65 at the
aggregate. The ratio of the indirect loss to the direct pecuniary and nonpecuniary loss is therefore

0.59
0.072∗0.65+0.4∗0.65

= 1.9. Alternatively, we can express the

indirect eﬀect as a multiple of the direct pecuniary eﬀects on the unemployed.
In this case, the indirect eﬀect is

0.59
0.072∗0.65

= 12.6 as big.

Table 3 lists the decomposition for all the measures of well-being. Its last
two columns show the ratio of indirect eﬀects to direct eﬀects, and the ratio of
total non-pecuniary eﬀects to pecuniary eﬀects. They show that the nonmonetary cost of unemployment is about 6 to 9 times as large as the monetary costs,
and that the indirect eﬀects of unemployment at the population level are substantially greater than the direct loss suﬀered by the unemployed themselves.
Individually the indirect eﬀects are small, but they aﬀect a much broader population.

We can summarize the accounting exercise using the averages from the ﬁrst
four measures of well-being: if the direct monetary loss of the unemployed
themselves is 1, the additional SWB loss of the unemployed is about 5, while

35

at the population level the indirect or spillover eﬀect is about 16 including the
impact of monetary loss to other household members. All together, the total
well-being costs of unemployment are about 20 times as large as those directly
due to the lower incomes of the unemployed.

Conclusion

This paper estimates the impact of aggregate unemployment on subjective wellbeing, using two recent large-scale American surveys, the Gallup-Healthways
Well-Being Index from 2008 to 2011 and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in recent
years and since the early 1990s in some cases. We contribute to a literature
that is relatively thin in US-based evidence with larger samples, ﬁner-grained
contextual information and alternative model speciﬁcations.
We ﬁnd robust evidence that unemployment has signiﬁcant indirect eﬀects
on the population, particularly so for those who are still employed. The basic
speciﬁcation correlates individual well-being with unemployment statistics at
the county level. But the evidence holds up well in a variety of models, including those that use alternative sources of variation based on external industrial
trends and occupational unemployment rates. We ﬁnd weaker estimates of the
indirect eﬀect from the ﬁxed-eﬀects model and higher estimates from instrumental variables based on external industrial trends that are strong predictors
of unemployment losses in the near future. We interpret the latter result as
indicating that the anticipation of future employment losses has negative effects on subjective well-being. We also explore the channel behind the indirect
eﬀect, and ﬁnd evidence indicative of the importance of job security, including
substantial negative eﬀects of workplace downsizing on the well-being of still36

employed workers. Overall we ﬁnd stronger, more clear-cut evidence from the
Gallup-Healthways surveys than from the BRFSS. The former provides consistent evidence both cross-sectionally and over time. The BRFSS shows strong
cross-sectional relationships, but much weaker relationships over time.
In the aggregate, the spillover eﬀects are substantially greater than the direct well-being costs for the unemployed themselves. For those who are still
employed, a one percentage point increase in local unemployment has an eﬀect
on subjective well-being close to that of a four percent fall in household income.
The income equivalents are calculated based on the estimated cross-sectional
relationship between household income and subjective well-being, which potentially suﬀer biases of uncertain directions. The estimated income equivalents
serve only as a crude indication that the spillover eﬀects of unemployment are
economically meaningful.

* The race/ethnicity information shown here are from data between 2008q1 to 2011q2.
Since 2011q2, the Gallup-Healthways has a diﬀerent treatment of racial classiﬁcation that
allows many more possible combinations of multiple races. We create a separate set of
dummy indicators and include them in the regression analysis.

Notes: (1) All regressions include the right-hand-side variables that are present in the
regressions in Table 1. (2) The ﬁxed-eﬀects model, the IV model and the model with
regional dummies use linear estimations, making their individual coeﬃcients not
comparable to those from other panels. Switching between linear and probit models aﬀects
the estimated coeﬃcients roughly proportionally. As a result, the ratio of coeﬃcients shown
in Table 2 are on a comparable scale.

estimated coeﬃcients roughly proportionally. As a result, the ratios of coeﬃcients shown in
Table 2 are on a comparable scale.
