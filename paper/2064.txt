The Economic Consequences of the Franc Poincare

ABSTRACT

In this paper we reassess the cyclical performance of the French
economy in the 1920s, focusing in particular on the period 1926—1931 and on
France's resistance to the Great Depression. France expanded rapidly after
1926 and, unlike the other leading industrial economies, resisted the onset
of the Depression until 1931. We find strikingly little support for the
conventional explanation for these events, which emphasizes an undervalued
French franc and an export—led boom. While French exports as a share of GDP
turned down as early as 1928, the economy continued to expand for several
subsequent years. Investment, not exports, emerges as the proximate source
of the French economy's resistance to the Great Depression. And fiscal
policy emerges as the major determinant of the surge in French investment
spending. Previous accounts have emphasized the role of monetary policy in
determining the real and nominal exchange rates ostensibly responsible for
French economic fluctuations in the decade after 1921. In contrast, we argue
here for a more balanced view of the roles of monetary and fiscal policies

I. Introduction

The macroeconomic performance of the French economy in the 1920s
contrasts sharply with cyclical experience in the rest of the industrialized
world.

French gross domestic product and industrial output grew with

exceptional vigor over the first half of the 1920s (see Table 1).

1

After a

recession in 1926—27 and despite a noticeable deceleration in the rate of
economic growth, through the end of the decade the French economy continued to
expand at a rate significantly in excess of the international average.

Well

into calendar year 1930, France remained immune to the effects of the Great
Depression, and even in 1931 the downturn remained moderate compared to other
parts of the world. But once the full effects of the Depression were felt, its

impact in France was exceptionally severe; as late as 1938 gross domestic
product had not recovered to 1931 levels.

Accounts of the interwar period attach more weight to the exchange rate

than to any other variable affecting the French economy's macroeconomic
performance. Histories of the period 1919—1926 are dominated by "the battle
of the franc," when financial difficulties culminating in the loss of 80 per
cent of the currency's external value greatly stimulated the export industries

and macroeconomy. The period 1926—1931 is characterized as the golden era of

the "franc Poincaré," when exchange—rate stabilization at an undervalued
parity enhanced the competitiveness of French exports, stimulating growth
through the end of the decade and insulating the economy from the onset of the

starting in 1931 rendred the franc overvalued and greatly exacerbated the
impact of the slump on French industry and trade, largely accounting for the
singular depth and long duration of the French Depression.

Typically monetary policy is credited with driving the exchange rate and
the French economy over the decade ending in 1930. Fiscal policy plays a role

only insofar as it influences money supply. In conventional accounts, the
-

period through the summer of 1926 is marked by real and nominal exchange rate
depreciation due to excessive money creation. Real depreciation stimulated
-the French economy for reasons related to both aggregate demand and aggregate
supply.

On the supply side, the rise in producer prices exceeded the rate of

wage inflation, reducing unit labor costs and thereby encouraging firms to

In this conventional view, the French economy's expansion

in the decade ending in 1930 is a classic instance of export—led growth.

In this paper we reassess the cyclical performance of the French economy

in the 1920s, focusing particularly on the period 1926-1931 and on France's

resistance to the Great Depression.

Our analysis of French macroeconomic

performance differs from the conventional view.

We find strikingly little

support for the export—based explanation of French economic growth after 1926.

French investment spending. In effect, we argue for a more balanced view of
the roles of monetary and fiscal policies in French macroeconomic fluctuations
over the decade 1921—1930.

Throughout the

paper, our discussion of the links between French fiscal

stresses the resource flow or classic crowding—in

effects of observed reductions in the budget deficit. Eliminating the fiscal
deficit and moving the budget into successively larger surpluses made
available to private investors an increasing proportion of domestic savings.

There exists an alternative explanation which emphasizes instead Poincaré's
reputation for financial orthodoxy, according to which Poincaré's return to
power removed the spectre of financial uncertainty, prospective future budget

-deficits, and large—scale capital levies, igniting a massive capital inflow
that reduced the required rate of return on capital and stimulated investment.

In fact, the two hypotheses are

compatible, as we explain below. Our

empirical analysis suggests, however, that classic crowding in due to current
budgetary measures, rather than confidence—induced capital inflows due in part

to expected future budgetary measures, was the critical determinant of the
French investment boom.

In the course of challenging the traditional interpretation of French
macroeconomic trends in the 1920s, we touch on several issues of more general
interest relevant to contemporary experiences with fiscal stabilization.

We

provide an explicit analysis of the effects of a fiscal contraction in a
perfect—foresight model of an open economy in which the government budget is
linked to stocks of productive capital and foreign debt, and in which fiscal
policy has an impact on employment due to inertia in labor markets.

(Mundell, 1963; Fleming, 1962; Sachs, 1980). Dynamic models have

been developed but without capital accumulation (Branson and Buiter, 1983;
Sachs and Wyplosz, 1985; Cuddington and Vifials, 1986a, 1986b). Investigators
working in the disequilibrium tradition combine wage and price rigidities with

capital accumulation, but only under extremely restrictive assumptions about
dynamics (Neary and Stiglitz, 1983). In this paper, we integrate the essential
features of these models into a more general analytical framework.

II. French Economic Performance, 1921—1931

Historical accounts of the French economy in the years 1921—30 typically

divide the decade into three segments: the period of inflation from 1921
through mid-1926, the period of stabilization from Poincaré's return to power

in July 1926 through the 1927 recession, and the period of renewed growth
through the end of 1930. The decline of the franc in the first half of the

twenties is credited with subsidizing exports and promoting investment by
lightening the burden of fixed charges (Kemp, 1972, p.97; Bernard, 1975, p.
180; Jackson, 1985, p. 11). Establishment of the franc Poincaré in the second
half of the decade, "by slightly undervaluing the currency," is credited with
stimulating "an export—led boom to round off the period of postwar prosperity"

(Kemp, 1972, p.84).

The Great Depression has relatively little impact on

France as late as 1930 chiefly because of exchange—rate undervaluation (Kemp,
1971, p. 89; 1972, p. 100).

To assess the role of the exchange rate in these developments, it is
first necessary to have an adequate measure of its movement. We therefore

contruct quarterly time series for the real and nominal effective exchange

rates for the period 1922—1937. The nominal effective exchange rate is a
weighted average of bilateral rates against France's trading partners, with

trade shares serving as weights. The real effective exchange rate is the
product of the nominal effective rate and the ratio of foreign to domestic
prices. Both effective exchange rates are displayed in Chart

Chart 2, where exports in constant 1929 prices are plotted along with the

real effective exchange rate, confirms that the real exchange rate had
powerful demand—side effects.6 But although persistent real depreciation was

accompanied by steady export growth through 1926, post—1927 experience is
inconsistent with the export—based interpretation of the French economy's

peak level through 1930, export volume fell in 1929, reflecting the decline in
world incomes due to the onset of the Depression and the imposition of trade
restrictions abroad..7 The export share of GDP fell even earlier, in calendar

year 1928.
While exchange—rate depreciation may have prevented exports from
declining even more rapidly than this, the extent and even the very fact of
their decline suggests that the impact of real depreciation on export demand
cannot by itself account for the persistence of French economic growth after
1928.8

To see whether these demand-side effects were accompanied by supply—side
stimuli, we consider in Chart 3 two measures of real labor costs: the nominal
wage deflated by wholesale and retail price indices, respectively labelled the

real producer and real consumer wage. While each index includes both traded

and nontraded goods, the wholesale price index places a heavier weight on
traded—goods prices.9 Since the profitability of traded goods production is
particularly relevant to the export—led interpretation of the French economy's

growth, we focus initially on money wages relative to wholesale prices as a
measure of the real wage. Although Chart 3 confirms that nominal wages lagged
wholesale prices during the 1922—26 inflation, it indicates also that much of

this reduction in real producer wages was eroded within a

stabilization.10 Once inflation was halted in 1926, the franc appreciated over
-the second half of the year and prices declined, albeit more slowly than the

exchange rate recovered.

As prices fell, money wages lagged behind, and by

1927—111 the relationship between wager and wholesale prices had been restored

to 1923 levels. By 1928 the franc rio longer provided the producers of traded

goods an incentive to expand export supplies. Thus, it does not appear that
the franc's depreciation had long-lived supply—side effects.

This emphasis on supply—side considerations is predicated on the notion

that the real producer wage influenced the level of employment, because
employers adjusted hiring to equate the cost of labor and the value of its
marginal product. As evidence on this relationship, Chart 4 presents Calenson
and Zeilner's (1957) estimate of French unemployment along with our proxy for

the real producer wage. While this estimate of the unemployment rate is far
from definitive, even with a generous margin for error it would appear that
the real producer wage and unemployment tended to move in the same direction.
Although the 1927 recession, when firms apparently were demand constrained, is

a notable exception, the correspondence between the real producer wage and
unemployment is generally consistent with our interpretation.

The finding that the franc's depreciation failed to have long—lived
supply—side effects contrasts with experience elsewhere in Europe both in the

first half of the 1920s and after 1931.

In both instances, nominal

depreciation tended to reduce real wages and have a sustained impact on unit

labor costs.11

Only in France in the mid-1920s was the impact of nominal

depreciation on real wages not sustained. The reason for the contrast, Chart
3 suggests, is not necessarily any exceptional flexibility of the French labor

market, but that the Poincard stabilization initiated a large fall in the
nominal exchange rate and in prices which largely neutralized the implications
for aggregate supply of the preceding depreciation.

Thus, if the franc Poincaré insulated France from the initial effects of

the Great Depression, it must have worked through different channels than
those emphasized in simple aggregate-supply-aggregate--demand analyses. One

sectors of the economy did not share equally in France's initial immunity to

the Great Depression.

Textiles and autos did relatively poorly while

engineering machinery did relatively well.12 The general pattern seems to
favor investment—goods over consumer-goods industries.

Existing accounts

provide no guidance, however, as to why exchange-rate changes should have had
such differential effects.

To shed further light on the behavior of investment—goods industries,
Chart 5 and Table 2 decompose GNP into consumption, investment, government

spending and the current account of the balance of payments. The share of
investment in GNP rises rapidly toward the end of the 1920s, from 14 per cent
in 1927 to nearly 21 per cent in 1930 and 19 per cent in 1931. In comparison,

the current account moves only slightly, from a surplus of three per cent of

GNP in 1926 to balance in 1930. The direction of its movement is in fact
inconsistent with the hypothesis that the growth of net exports provided the
stimulus for expansion. Clearly, the "French boom" of the second half of the
1920s was investment-led expansion, not export-led growth. Insofar as France

resisted the onset of the Depression, credit lies with the buoyancy of

Chart 6 depicts the government budget balance as a percentage of GNP. The
budget moves from substantial deficit in the immediate postwar years to
balance by 1925—26 and then into surplus which peaks as a share of GNP in

1929. The correspondence between the budget surplus, the real effective
exchange rate and the share of investment in GNP indicates the need to explore
the links between these variables.

These shifts in the composition of demand between exports, investment and

government spending should have been promoted by the changes in relative
prices underlying the time series in Chart 3. As noted above, the rise in the

ratio of retail to wholesale prices after 1927 (shown explicitly in Chart 7)
implies an increase in the relative price of nontraded goods which should have
shifted resources out of the production of exportables and into the home goods

sector. This relative price appears to explain how the French economy

This

reallocation of resources cannot be viewed as a passive response to

the Depression, however.

Were this the case, one would expect the traded—

nontraded goods price to move concurrently with or to follow the decline in
export demand. In fact, the fall in the relative price of traded goods led by

a year the decline in the export share of French GNP. This suggests the need
to analyze supply conditions at a more disaggregated level.

This review of French economic performance in the 1920s identifies two
central questions. First, why did the price and production of French exports

fall after 1927 despite the maintenance of a depreciated exchange rate?
Second, what accounts for the current surge in domestic investment? We take up
these questions one at a time in the next two sections.

III. Export Growth and Stabilization: A Franco-Scandinavian Model

The relative price of traded and nontraded goods better tracks the path

of French exports than does the real exchange rate (the relative price of
imports and exports). Clearly, a one—sector model that fails to distinguish
between the production of traded and nontraded goods is incapable of capturing
key aspects of French economic performance in this period.'3

The distinction between traded and nontraded goods has been popularized

by Scandinavian economists (e.g. Aukrust, 1977; Edgren, Faxen and Odhner,
In the Scandinavian model, wages are tied to the prices of traded
1969).
goods.14 Chart 3 suggests, however, that in the l920s French wages were more

closely linked to the cost of living inclusive of the prices of nontraded

goods. Our model therefore departs from the Scandinavian approach in its
specification of wage determination, and in addition by allowing the overall
level of employment to be endogenously determined)5

We start with the small country assumption, which implies that rest—of—

Traded goods, in contrast, are Heckscher—Ohlin commodities, produced
using both labor and an exogenously fixed stock of capital. (We relax the
assumption of a fixed capital stock in the next section.) Given a production
function f(L,K) and the assumption of perfect competition, employment in the

traded goods sector is adjusted to equate the wage with the value marginal

Inverting (3) yields the derived demand for labor in the

(4)

Under the small country assumption, domestic producers of traded goods

are never constrained in the quantities they sell: while domestic demand
depends on relative prices and income, any excess of domestic supply over
demand is exported to foreign markets. Domestic producers adjust production
and hiring to be on their labor demand curves. In Figure 1, employment in the

production of traded goods is the distance PLT. This distance is determined
by the intersection of the employment schedule VMPLT with the wage.

In contrast to the demand for traded goods, which is perfectly elastic at

world prices, the demand for nontraded goods depends on domestic income (which

is proportional to total employment LT and LN) and on their relative price

The (uncompensated) price elasticity of demand for nontraded goods
appears in Figure 1 as the DN schedule, which (under the Ricardian assumption)

is also the derived demand for labor in the nontraded goods sector.

Aggregate labor supply is constant and represented in Figure 1 by the

exogenous, the model is closed by a wage determination rule. We assume that

labor mobility equates wages across sectors and, as suggested by Chart 3,
that economy—wide wages respond with a lag to the cost of living:16

the period of the depreciation, unemployment falls from LTLN to L4 L'N. In

the subsequent period, wages respond to the initial rise in the cost of
living, restoring the equality V =

initial level. In Figure 1 this is shown as an upward shift in the W =

schedule.
These dynamics are depicted in Figure 2. A one—time depreciation moves

the system from
the real wage has been reduced and the level of employment has been

correspondingly increased.

With no further change in the exchange rate, the

wage rises in the next period to ',

restoring employment to its initial

level.

The model can be used to interpret several macroeconomic features of the

1920s. According to leading accounts of the period (e.g. Sauvy, 1984), the
years 1921—26 were dominated by a series of unanticipated depreciations)8

Each time the exchange rate depreciated, domestic prices initially lagged

6'

w

5l

e

Figure 2

- 10
behind.

Prices and wages subsequently responded, however, to increases in the

exchange rate.

In Figure 2, the path a—l-2—3—4—5 is meant to capture these

aspects of French experience. As in Chart 3,

the real wage (nominal wage

deflated by the cost of living) initially falls but remains stable in the face

of successive depreciations. (In contrast, the path ct-1'--2'—3'-4'—5' shows

the effects of accelerating depreciation.)

As in Chart 7, the CPI falls

relative to the WPI, since nontraded goods, whose prices depend heavily on the

now lower real wage, are more heavily represented in the CPI. As in Chart 4,
depreciation is associated with a decline in unemployment.

As in Chart 2,

depreciation is accompanied by a rise in exports.

The effects of terminating inflation and pemitting the exchange rate to

appreciate before returning the franc to the gold standard (the policy
followed between Poincaré's return to power in the Summer of 1926 and the de

facto stabilization at the end of the year) are depicted in Figure 2 by the
path 5'—6'—&'. Due to the response of wages to lagged prices, real wages rise
above their initial level following stabilization, and employment temporarily

falls. As in Chart 4, stabilization is associated

with

transitional

unemployment, and, as in Chart 2, the volume of exports tends to decline.

Thus, a simple model provides a coherent explanation for many of the
dominant macroeconomic characteristics of the French economy in the 1920s,

including the declining role of exports in French economy following the
Poincaré stabilization.
What remains to be explained is the buoyancy of
investment in the post—stabilization era. In the next section, we therefore
imbed this Franco-Scandinavian framework in a dynamic, forward—looking model
of investment in the open economy.

IV.

Investment

and Fiscal Stabilization: A Dynamic Model

In this section, we explore the links between the 1926 stabilization, the

subsequent decline in the export share of GNP, and the surge in investment
spending which was the proximate source of the French economy's resistance to

the onset of the Great Depression. The previous section explains the decline
in the export share as a delayed effect of exchange—rate stabilization.

In

this section, we integrate that explanation with an analysis of the investment
response.

-

— 11 —

The

model providing the basis for the analysis is summarized in Table 3.

As in the Franco—Scandinavian model of the previous section, the domestic
economy produces both traded and nontraded goods, traded goods using capital
and labor, nontraded goods using labor alone. As in the previous section, the

price of nontraded goods is proportional to the wage. But in contrast to the

previous section, three distinct commodities are consumed: importables,
exportables and nontraded goods (with the domestic economy specialized in the
production of the last two). Demands depend on two relative prices, the price

of nontradables relative to exports

and the price of imports relative

to exports (eP*IPE). Exportables are the numeraire throughout. We adopt the

semi—small—country assumption, that the world price of imports is given

and the relative price of nontraded goods as:

(8)

In contrast to the Franco—Scandinavian model, the real exchange rate,

investment and the adjustment of government spending are now endogenously
determined.

Real GDP, in units of exportables, is given by eq. 9 in Table 3. Real
expenditure, given by eq. 10, is a function of real disposable income and real

wealth Q. Disposable income as a determinant of expenditure can be jusitified

on the basis of liquidity constraints; thus, our expenditure function
incorporates both Keynesian and permanent income features.

As in the previous section, the supply of traded goods is perfectly
elastic at the prevailing wage (eq. 12), with the wage adjusting gradually
over time to eliminate excess supply or demand in the labor market (eq.15).

Domestic expenditure is the sum of the demands of the private (eq. 13) and
public (eq. 14) sectors, whose allocations across commodities are derived from
instantaneous Cobb—Douglas utility functions.

The real exchange rate X adjusts instantaneously to clear the market for
exportables (eq. 17). The demand for exportables is the sum of private (eq.
18), public (eq. 19) and foreign (eq. 20) consumption plus domestic investment

(eq. 17). Capital accumulation is a function of Tobin's q (eq. 21). Gross
investment spending differs from capital accumulation by an allowance for
capital depreciation at rate 8 (eq. 22).

Domestic debt and equity are assumed to be perfect substitutes for one
another but imperfect substitutes for foreign assets. Foreigners do not hold
domestic assets. These assumptions highlight the role of the (exchange) risk
premium in rendering domestic residents willing to hold increasing quantities

of domestic assets. They are designed to capture the idea that increases in

public debt raise the danger of a capital levy on all domestic assets, a
policy option much discussed in France in the 1920s.

the form of changes in government spending, holding taxes constant.

Our neglect of the monetary sector in general, and of money financing of

the deficit in particular, in our analysis of the post—1926 situation can be
justified on two grounds. First, under the gold standard the supply of money
was in principle determined exclusively by money demand.

Given a credibly

pegged exchange rate, nominal interest rates were determined exclusively by

interest rates in the rest of the world. Changes in the domestic credit
component of the monetary base therefore should have had no implications for

total money supply. Second, after 1926 the Bank of France functioned under

new

regulations which prohibited it from monetizing government budget

deficits.

To analyze the post—1926 situation in France, we perform the following

experiment. Starting from steady—state equilibrium in period zero, we cut
government spending so as to reduce the steady state value of public debt from

B0 to L The real debt is assumed to evolve according to:

Since taxes are held constant, eqs. 25 and 26 together determine the path of
public spending.2°

Given its size, the model in Table 3 cannot be solved analytically.
Instead, we calibrate it using data for the l920s, linearize it around the

steady state, and simulate it under the assumption of perfect foresight.
Parameter values and initial conditions for endogenous variables are given in

Tables 3 and 4. While we have attempted to use historical data to guide the
selection of parameter values, any attempt at calibration can only approximate

the properties of the economy being modeled. We therefore urge caution in
interpreting the simulation results; they are meant only to illustrate the

properties of the simulation model and indicate the general orders of
magnitude of the result of our fiscal policy experiment.

Our discussion emphasizes three aspects of the simulation results in
Table 4: the impact of the change in fiscal policy on investment, on the real

exchange rate, and on the relative price of nontraded goods.

interested

in whether the simulation captures the surge in investment after

1927, the maintenance of the real exchange rate at low levels, and the early
rise in the relative price of nontraded goods.

The simulation generates a real depreciation on impact followed by a
relatively flat real exchange rate path. As the fiscal contraction reduces
domestic demand, an incipient excess supply of exportables develops and is

eliminated through a fall in their relative price, which increases export
sales. The brevity of the 1927 recession may be explicable in part on the
basis of this expenditure—switching effect.

Thus, we find that not only monetary policy but fiscal policy as well are

critical for understanding the post—1926 real exchange rate path. Had the
real depreciation of the period 1922—26, so prominent in Chart 2, resulted

simply from nominal exchange rate overshooting in response to monetary
expansion and inflation prior to the Poincaré stabilization (the Dornbusch

(1976) mechanism), one would expect the real exchange rate to recover
following monetary stabilization; instead, the real exchange rate remains at

its new higher level, suggesting that the domestic expenditure effects of

fiscal contraction played a dominant role in its post—1926 path. (The
correlation between the government budget deficit and the real exchange rate
is also evident in Chart 6.) Thus, the real depreciation of the franc, rather

than a clever ploy by French monetary policy makers, should be seen as a
consequence of the fiscal reforms which eliminated the budget deficit.

The simulation also generates a surge in investment like that observed in

France after stabilization. Investment rises as a result of a jump in Tobin's

q.21 Following its initial rise, q declines continuously toward its steady

state level, and investment falls gradually. The behavior of q is a
consequence of the impact of public debt reduction on interest rates and
arbitrage among financial assets.

The real exchange rate depreciates on

impact, after which it rises slowly; so long as it is rising the domestic
interest rate must fall relative to the yield on foreign assets. Over time, a

fall in the outstanding stock of domestic debt reduces the interest rate

domestic residents require in order to hold that debt, reinforcing this
effect.

Since arbitrage equalizes the rates of return on domestic debt and

equity, the lower interest rate on debt implies capital losses on equity,
causing q to fall over time. For q to fall over time, it must rise on impact,

providing

the initial stimulus to investment. While the contractionary fiscal

initiative results in crowding in of investment as in simple income—
expenditure models, in our framework it results indirectly

from

the

relationship between real interest rates, real exchange rates, and Tobin's q.

The one aspect of the simulation that does not conform to historical
experience is the simulated decline in the price of nontraded goods relative

to the price of exports. The reason for this result is our assumption that
investment spending falls exclusively on exportables while government spending

is distributed among exportables, importables and nontraded goods.

In the

simulation, as government spending falls and investment rises, expenditure
tends to be switched away from nontraded goods, resulting in a modest decline
in

their

relative price.

It would be straightforward to alter the

specification to better track this aspect of historical experience.

Finally, note the simulated path of GDP in the final column of Table 4.

which results from cumulated investment sustains an increased volume of
production.

The fiscal multiplier is positive in the short run, negative in

the long run. Over the span of time of concern to us here, 1926 to 1931, the

reduction in government spending probably remained contractionary, reducing
the rate of growth of the French economy.
This is consistent with the
deceleration in the rate of French economic growth between 1921—1926 and 1927—

1930 (see the first two rows of Table 1). At the same time, the fiscal
contraction switched demand toward domestic sources, namely investment,
reducing the economy's dependence on foreign demand and insulating the economy
from the initial effects of the Great Depression.

V. Further Evidence

The model of Section IV, while successfully replicating the critical
features of French macroeconomic experience after 1926, incorporates various

restrictive assumptions.

In this section we provide further evidence in

support of the specification.

Our specification of investment highlights the role of Tobin's q. Chart 8

illustrates the close correlation between q and French investment during the

years, but suggests that investment depended not on current but on

lagged real share prices.22 This is inconsistent with the early formulations

of the q theory of investment, as proposed by Tobin (1969) and developed by
Abel (1979) and Hayashi (1982), in which investment depends solely on current
q, which incapsulates all relevant information about the current and expected
future profitability of additions to the capital stock. However, a variety of

studies of the postwar period have found, as in Chart 8, that lagged q has
more explanatory Dover than current q, leading Fischer (1983), Kydland •and
Prescott

(1982)

and Ueda and Yoshikawa (1986) to incorporate order and

delivery lags into the q theory of investment and to derive estimating
equations in which current investment depends on lagged q.

Empirical versions of our investment equation appear in Table 5.

The

results confirm that lagged q dominates current q as a determinant of
investment.23 The role of lagged q in determining investment plays a central

role in our interpretation of French macroeconomic performance on the eve of

the Great Depression. The buoyancy of the French economy in calendar year
1930 is primarily a buoyancy of investment spending, which remains high in

1930 because q was high in 1929.

In other words, the investment boom

continued into 1930 because of lags in the ability of firms to order, receive

delivery and install capital goods and equipment that they would have wished

to obtain in 1929 when stock prices peaked.

The French economy was

exceptionally resistant to the onset of the Depression because demand had been

switched toward this domestic source — investment

—

and away from foreign

sources precisely when foreign markets collapsed.

How general was this surge in investment spending? Table 6 displays
investment trends in agriculture, three leading manufacturing industries,
construction, transportation, services and commerce. Investment rose in all
sectors but transportation in 1927 and across the board in 1928 and 1929.

In

1930 investment fell significantly only in the textile industry (which
produced luxury goods for export and therefore was overwhelmed by the onset of

Depression abroad), declining marginally in agriculture and commerce as well.
In 1931, in contrast, there was a dramatic fall in investment in every sector

except transportation, where developments reflect the relative stability of
government spending. Thus, the investment surge highlighted in our account of

post—1926 French macroeconomic trends is impossible to explain in terms of

shocks

to particular sectors, and surely

from

economy—wide

developments such as changes in the stance of fiscal policy.

In our model, fiscal policy is linked to investment via Tobin's q. Table
7 documents the influence of fiscal policy on q. In the first two equations,

q (and, according to Table 5, investment) responds positively to the budget
surplus.

Evidence of serial correlation led us to add additional regressors

to the equation. Neither the money supply nor its rate of growth (whether
measured in real or nominal terms) significantly influenced real share prices
or reduced the extent of autocorrelation. In contrast, the real exchange rate

was statistically significant, reduced the extent of autocorrelation, and
dominated the fiscal policy measure, as shown in the third line of Table 7.

This is evidence against the fiscal policy—q relationship only if the real
exchange rate is not itself a function of fiscal variables.
Our model

predicts that Tobin's q and the real exchange rate should be jointly
determined by fiscal policy.
Table 8 confirms that this was the case
empirically.

According to the coefficient on the budget surplus, fiscal

contraction led to real exchange rate depreciation. We enter as additional
regressors the rate of real money growth and the rate of real money growth
interacted with a dummy variable for the fixed exchange rate period to allow
the real exchange rate to respond to both monetary and fiscal policy. Adding
monetary policy confirms that both monetary and fiscal policies influenced the
path of the real exchange rate, as argued above, but does nothing to undermine
the real exchange rate's dependence on the budget surplus.

Finally, we attempt to test our explanation for the post—1926 investment
surge against a competing interpretation.

While our explanation for the

investment boom stresses observed reductions in the budget deficit and the
classic crowding—in effects of contractionary fiscal policy, the alternative

emphasizes the impact on confidence of Poincard's reputation for financial
orthodoxy. According to the reputational argument, Poincaré's return to power

removed the spectre of continued financial uncertainty, prospective future
budget deficits, and large—scale capital levies. This interpretation holds
that once confidence was restored, capital flight came to end, reducing the

required rate of return on capital and stimulating investment.

Thus,
confidence (and in particular confidence-induced capital inflows) rather than

the resource flow or classic crowding in effects of contractionary fiscal

policy supposedly explains the investment boom. Since Tobin's q captures

market expectations, the confidence interpretation is not incompatible with
our's; it simply differs in asserting that the rise in stock prices cannot be
explained solely by contemporary observable policy measures.

Attempts to test the confidence argument fail to turn up evidence in its

support. Capital inflows, under the alternative view, should be comprised of
both a component reflecting observed policy measures and a residual component

reflecting confidence. Since the equation includes both observed policy
measures and actual capital inflows, the confidence argument can be tested by

examining the coefficient on the capital inflows variable.241n the last
regressions in both Tables 7 and 8, the capital inflows proxy uniformly enters

insignificantly. Thus, we find no support for the alternative view.

VI. Conclusion

In this paper we have assembled evidence which contradicts the standard

view that the undervalued Franc Poincaré, by boosting exports, succeeded
initially in insulating France from the Great Depression. Our own explanation

emphasizes instead the role of investment growth as the proximate source of
France's resistance to the onset of the slump. The traditional interpretation

of this period has also tended to stress monetary factors, attributing
undervaluation of the franc even after 1929 to a sustained period of inflation

terminated by an abrupt monetary stabilization. We consider such a long—

lasting monetary non-neutrality unplausible and focus instead on fiscal
stabilization, which transformed the government budget from large deficit in
the early 1920s to surplus after 1926. Real depreciation, the surge in stock

prices and the attendant crowding in of investment spending are all shown to
be consequences of such a fiscal stabilization. We do not wish to belittle the

role either of monetary factors in the nominal depreciation or of monetary
finance of the budget deficits. But we wish to emphasize that the independent
effects of fiscal policy have not been adequately acknowledged.

These effects are analyzed here using a model with some relevance to
current policy discussions in countries attempting to curb their government
deficits and reduce their public debts. While we have not estimated the model,

its key assumptions are supported by the data. In particular, the links
between fiscal policy, the real exchange rate and Tobin's q are sufficiently

well established that we see no need to involve the purely psychological

— 19 —

effects of Poincaré return to power when attempting to understand the
macroeconomic sequel to that event. What mattered were Poiricaré's policies,
not merely his reputation.

these variations increase in size with sterling's devaluation in 1931 and
the dollar's devaluation in 1933.

where EXPORTS is Commerce Special (in millions of tons) from Sauvy (1884),

p.338, col. 8, REER is the real effective exchange rate (calculated as in
Chart 1, so that a rise denotes real depreciation), and Y* is the index of

world industrial production (from London and Cambridge Economic Service,
1970), shown in Table 1. The data are annual and the estimation period is
1922—38.

In the regression, all variables are entered in logs, vith t—

statistics in parentheses.

p

coefficient.

7. The pattern we describe in the text holds for exports of foodstuffs, raw
materials and manufactured goods alike, except that raw materials exports

fall in 1928, foodstuffs in 1929 and manufactures in 1930.

The early

downturn in exports of materials reflects the worldwide slump in primary

commodity markets (Levis, 1949), which even an "undervalued franc" was
apparently unable to overcome.

8. Another channel through which the exchange rate concei'ab1y might have
influenced demand was import substitution. Even if the volume of exports

fell after 1928 and the export/GNP ratio fell after 1927 depreciation

could have stimulated domestic demand had expenditure oi imports been
switched toward home goods at an even faster rate.

In fact, the trade

balance deteriorates rather than improving over the period, indicating
that imports declined less quickly than exports, which casts doubt on the
import—substitution hypothesis.

9. For example, such nontraded goods as housing, the prices of which moved n
a very different fashion due to rent control (Hawtrey, 1931), are included

only in the retail price index. On the construction of these indices, see
INSEE (1966).

— 22 —

10. The one exception to the general erosion of real wages during the
inflationary era — the rise in real wages between the first and second
the
quarters of 1924 — is itself explicable in terms of wage lag:
exceptional real wage increase of early 1924 took place in a period when

the authorities succeeded in temporarily stabilizing the franc and
actually engineering a price decline.

11. On the early 1920s in Europe, North America, Japan and the Antipodes, see
Eichengreen (1986b). On European experience in the 1930s, see Eichengreen
and Sachs (1985).

12. We have drawn disaggregated industrial production indices from League of
Nations (various issues).

13. The importance of this distinction did not escape contemporary French

economists such as Dessirier (1935),

who

calculated

indices

of

profitability separately for industries producing traded and nontraded
goods. In addition, Dessirier distinguished a third sector comprised of
firms engaged in the provision of public services.

14. It is this focus on wage formation that leads us to emphasize our model's

resemblance to the Scandinavian Model rather than the Dependent Economy
Model of Salter (1959) and Swan (1960), which also distinguishes traded
and nontraded goods.

15. To our knowledge, no previous model incorporates both these features,
although the framework developed below bears some resemblance to those of

Dornbusch (1974), Dornbusch (1980, pp.97—115) and Frenkel and Rodriguez
(1982).

Dornbusch's Dependent Economy Model implicitly the maintains the

assumption of full employment however, while in Frenkel and Rodriguez
(1982) output depends only on relative commodity prices.

16. Eq. (6) is a linear approximation around an initial position in which W, e
and

all equal unity and y is the share of traded goods in consumption.

17. A limitation of this framework is the absence of explicit treatment of the

monetary sector.
taken as exogenous.

Depreciation of the exchange rate therefore must be

— 23 —

18. The lack of foresight regarding the evolution of the exchange rate,
inflation and the money supply is justified on the grounds that changes in

the rate of money growth were related to unanticipated changes in
governments and Ministers of Finance.

There were 11 cabinets in the

period 1921—26 (Sauvy, 1984, Vol. I, pp.388—392).

19. In the limiting case of perfect substitutability, db/dz =

. The

analysis
which follows is based on the general case of imperfect substitutability.

In the interest of simplicity, we suppress the Laursen—Metzler effect.
However, permitting saving to be positively related to X would have no
effect on our simulation results.

20. Alternative deficit closing rules are discussed in Sachs and Wyplosz
(1984). Nothing of importance hinges on particular specification adopted
here since it is assumed that government spending falls on exportables,

nontradables and imported goods in the same proportions as private
spending.

21. By specifying investment solely as a function of q and eliminating any
accelerator mechanism, we reduce the danger that an investment response to
an autonomous recovery could be misconstrued as a cause of that recovery.

22. Note that the dependence of investment on real equity prices needs not
suggest that the stock market was a significant source of liquidity for

firms wishing to fund investment. (In fact, this was generally not the
case in interwar France.) Rather, it reflects the impact on investment of

assessments of the current and future profitability of additions to the
capital stock relative to the cost of those additions, assuming only that
the expectations of stock market participants are positively correlated if

not necessarily representative of the expectations of investors as a
whole.

23. Our preferred specification, eq. 2, provides supporr for a hybrid
investment equation which combines the q theory with he accelerator.
Such equations are sometimes justified on the grounds that some firms are

liquidity constrained and are able to increase inveriment only when
profits rise as a result of increased output.

24. Alternatively, we included a dummy variable for the years of Poincaré's
government as another proxy for confidence effects. This variable failed

to undermine the significance of the fiscal policy measure, was itself
statistically insignificant, and generally entered with a negative sign.

Data Sources

1) Effective Exchange Rates

The effective exchange rates ware calculated as weighted averages of the
exchange rates against France's major trading partners. The weights were based

on the aggregate percentage of trade, including exports and Imports but
excluding reiniports (Commerce Special) in the years 1923, 1927, 1932, 1935,
1938 of the major trading partners.' Major partners were defined as countries
accounting for at least 1% of total French trade during the above five years,
with the following exceptions:

1. Trade with French colonies was excluded (21.98% of total
trade) because of the dominance of non—price factors and owing to the
lack of reliable wholesale price indices for the colonies.

2. Trade with Brazil (1.26 % of total trade) was excluded
because of lack of a reliable wholesale price index.

3. Trade with Sweden (0.87 % of total trade) was included
because of its rapid growth over the period.

Trade weights for the intervening years were interpolated on a moving average
basis.2

2) Exchange Rates

Where data are from the Statistique Gdndrale de la France (1951),
exchange rate quotations are the average monthly exchange rate in Paris. Where

data are from the League of Nations Statistical Yearbooks,3 the exchange rate
was calculated as follows:

a) Pre 1931: Exchange rates against the dollar were converted to
French francs by the dollar/franc rate in Paris.

— 26 —

b)

1932—Sept. 1936: Exchange rates quoted as a percentage of

1929 gold parities were converted into current nominal rates,
multiplying by the 1929 gold parity of foreign currencies.

c) Post Oct. 1936: Exchange rates, as a percentage of 1929 gold

parities, were converted by multiplying both the franc and foreign
currency prices by their 1929 gold parities.

d) Exceptions: Egypt: exchange rate is quoted in terms of the
pound sterling (El = .975 units of local currency).

3) Prices

To calculate the real effective exchange rate, the nominal effective
exchange rate described above was multiplied by the ratio of foreign wholesale

prices to French wholesale prices. Sources of the wholesale price data are

described in (6) below. Foreign prices were weighted by the trade shares
described above.

Owing to large relative price movements at the time of German monetary

stabilization in 1924 and the dominant influence of political factors in
France—Germany trade, the weight of the German exchange rate was set to zero
for the period 1922—24. We recalculated the weights for the years before 1925

excluding Germany (which accounted for 4.2 percent of total French trade in
1924), and then included Germany in the weights for the period from 1925.

4) World Demand

Sources and methods of calculation are shown in Table 1. Of the original
set of countries, Australia, Egypt, India and Argentina were omitted for lack
of reliable data and weights were adjusted accordingly.
