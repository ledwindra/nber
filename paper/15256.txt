Estimating Causal Effects of Early Occupational Choice on Later Health: Evidence Using
the PSID

NBER Working Paper No. 15256

JEL No. I1,I10
ABSTRACT
In this paper, we provide some of the first empirical evidence of whether early occupational choices
are associated with lasting effects on health status, affecting individuals as they age. We take advantage
of data on occupational histories available in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to examine
this issue. To the PSID data, we merge historical Census data that reflect the labor market conditions
when each individual in the PSID made his first occupational choice. These data on labor market
conditions (e.g. state-level share of blue collar workers) allow us to instrument for occupational choice
in order to alleviate endogeneity bias. We use parental occupation as additional instruments. Since
our instruments may have indirect effects on later health, we also control for respondent’s pre-labor
market health, education and several family and state background characteristics in order to make
the instruments more plausibly excludable. We find substantial evidence that a blue collar occupation
at labor force entry is associated with decrements to later health status, ceteris paribus. These health
effects are larger after controlling for endogeneity and are similar across sets of instruments. We also
find differences in the effects of occupation by gender, race, and age.

Introduction
Occupation may be an important determinant of health, one which has received
relatively little attention in the economics literature. The potential significance of
occupation in affecting health is due in part to the large number of hours spent working
each week over many years. Exposure to different physical and psychological job
conditions across occupations suggests that health may vary systematically by
occupation. Occupation also affects income and fringe benefit coverage, such as paid
sick leave and health insurance.
First occupation may have a durable impact on later health. Health habits, which
are often established relatively early in life, may also be affected by first occupation both
due to the direct effect of workplace (e.g. stress, ability to smoke on the job) and
indirectly through social norms (e.g. socializing at bars after work versus enjoying sports
together). One’s first-occupation may be a critical determinant of later health as it sets in
place a trajectory of job conditions, income and health insurance coverage which in turn
affect health.
The importance of early occupation on later health is consistent with the growing
body of economics literature indicating that early circumstances and choices have lasting
effects on later health. Case et al. (2005), Almond (2006) and Van den Berg et al. (2007)
provide compelling evidence that conditions in utero affect long-term health and other
life outcomes. Growing up in poverty and other early conditions have been shown to be
highly correlated with adverse adult outcomes (see Johnson and Schoeni 2007 and cites
therein). Similarly, health habits are often initiated in youth and set in motion a trajectory
of lifetime health habits (e.g. Gruber 2001, Williams 2005). Studies have shown that
labor market circumstances at time of workforce entry have long-lasting effects (e.g.
Raaum and Roed 2006). There is ample evidence that years of schooling, which is
determined when relatively young, has long-term impacts on both health and occupation
(Cutler and Lleras-Muney 2006, Lleras-Muney 2005, and Fletcher and Frisvold 2008).
However, there is also some evidence that the impact of education is reduced as one ages
(Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2006); in contrast occupation may increase in importance as a
factor of production of health as individuals age (Case and Deaton 2003).

Despite the growing literature on early choices and conditions, relatively little is
known regarding the long-term health implications of choice of first occupation. We
advance the literature by examining whether early occupational choices affect later health
outcomes using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The PSID
dataset contains data on key relevant measures: first occupation after completing
education, health later in life and a rich set of pre-labor market characteristics including
parent’s education, respondent’s childhood health status, years of schooling, and
adolescent health habits (smoking). The latter serves both as a risk preference proxy and
a health production input. Information on state of birth also allows us to control for
state-level characteristics during childhood.
We advance the literature by our focus on causality. Simultaneity between health
and occupation is difficult to address, especially when examining contemporaneous
measures of each. We use several mechanisms to make progress on assessing causal
relationship. First we use occupation when young (first occupation) which is
predetermined (Granger causality) for the somewhat older individuals that we select to be
in our data set. Second, we use controls for childhood conditions including education of
mother and father, smoking as a teenager, and own health when under age sixteen. These
are rarely available in national surveys of adults but it allows us to control for important
predictors of future health. Use of own health when young in essence absorbs the health
aspects of other early conditions. The set of childhood controls together help to control
for potential pathways of early factors on later health. Third, we use an instrumental
variable approach, and are able to propose instruments from two different domains to
address potential endogeneity (Murray, 2006 and Basu et al. 2007). In particular, we
merge external data from the Census to measure state-level share of blue collar workers
when the survey respondents were entering the labor market. We also examine the use of
father’s occupation.
Overall, we find evidence that early choice of blue collar employment
substantially reduces health at later ages and show that our two-stage results are larger
than standard OLS results. We find substantial variation in the effects of blue collar
employment on health by age, race, and gender. We also show that our instruments are
strong predictors of initial blue collar employment and pass over-identification tests.

Background
There is substantial evidence that occupation affects health through factors such
as job conditions, income, fringe benefits (such as health insurance) and occupational
prestige. Further, there is evidence that early occupation affects later labor market
factors. A separate line of research indicates that early conditions in life can affect later
health. Taken together, the multiple lines of research suggest that early occupation could
affect later health. However, there is little direct evidence on the latter. We briefly review
some relevant literature.
Occupation affects health.
Occupational medicine and sociology literatures indicate that occupation can
affect health through job conditions such as job stress, latitude on the job, risk of injury
and other workplace hazards as well as others (Rom and Markowitz, 2006). A series of
studies use PSID data from 1968 to 1991 to examine the role of job stress and job control
on mortality. They find that cumulative exposure to adverse working conditions, low
control jobs, and passive work significantly increases mortality. The studies indicate the
importance of considering health determinants from a life course approach (e.g. Karasek,
Theorell et al. 1988; Amick and Celentano 1991).
An influential set of longitudinal studies examine how current occupation affects
contemporaneous health (e.g. Marmot 1983; Marmot and Smith 1997; Marmot et al,
1997). A key finding is that lower occupational status is associated with worse health,
controlling for demographics, health habits and income, among other factors. These
papers focus on social position, occupational stress, and job control as mechanisms for
the impact on multiple measures of health, including coronary heart disease, self-reported
health, morbidity and health related behaviors (e.g. Bosma, Marmot et al. 1997; Ferrie,
Martikainen et al. 2005). Both health and occupation are measured contemporaneously,
leaving open the question of simultaneity.
In the economics literature, evidence on the impact of occupation on health is
relatively sparse. Case and Deaton (2003), using repeated cross-sectional surveys,
provide evidence that individuals in manual occupations have more rapidly declining
self-reported health as they age. Choo and Denny (2006) use synthetic cohorts and

3

parsimonious empirical models and find that manual workers in Canada face rapid
decreases in health, even controlling for chronic conditions.
Early conditions matter.
There is much evidence that a large set of early life conditions have long-lasting
health impacts. For example, Almond (2006) provides evidence that individuals who
were exposed to influenza in utero had higher rates of adult physical disability and other
negative outcomes. Case, Fertig, and Paxson (2005) find that maternal smoking during
pregnancy predicts poor adult health of the affected children. Johnson and Schoeni
(2007) show that low birth weight is associated with poor educational and health
outcomes. There is also a wide variety of evidence of a link between birth quarter and
later health outcomes such as mortality, which when linked with nutritional intake and
maternal infections during pregnancy, is suggestive of the consequences of early
conditions on later health (Costa and Lahey 2005).1
Choices made during adolescence, especially health habits, also have been found
to affect later health. These can affect later health both through the direct effects on
health and also via the serial correlation of these health habits over time (e.g. Gruber
2001, Williams 2005). For instance, most smokers start smoking before age 18; very
few start smoking after this age. Thus the habit of smoking as an adult has its origins in
youth.
Conceptually, the adolescent choice that is likely most similar to occupation is
educational choice. Occupational and educational choices are both made during late
adolescence/early adulthood. Both can potentially affect life trajectories and can each be
thought of as both consumption and investment decisions. While there is substantial
evidence that education has long run impacts on health, there is very little literature
examining the exact mechanism. Most researchers treat education as a critical factor but
also as a “black box” Quality of the school, the courses taken, grades etc. are typically
not delineated in production functions of health for adults (see Fletcher and Frisvold 2009
for a recent example, though). Rather, researchers examine relationships between years of

1

For example, there is evidence that being born in a 19th century recession in the Netherlands led to
increased mortality (van den Berg et al. 2006). There is also a large literature in epidemiology that links
famines to later health outcomes (see Almond 2006 for cites).

schooling and measures of health2. Similarly, we treat occupation as a black box that, if
found to be an important factor of production of health, should be further analyzed for the
explicit mechanisms. For example, occupation too could be decomposed into specific
aspects, including environmental characteristics, work schedules, psycho-social aspects
of the job, impact of peers and social norms and fringe benefit generosity. However, the
first step is to determine if there is an interesting and important relationship between first
occupation and later health. This is the aim of the paper.
There is also substantial evidence in the economics literature that early
occupational choices affect later wages levels, wage growth trajectories, and occupational
mobility (Parent 2000, Kamborouv and Manovskii 2006, Pavan 2005, Oreopoulos et al.
2008). Von Wachter and Bender (2006) have found that labor market conditions faced by
a young worker affect later labor market success. Thus, early occupation has been found
to have an impact on later labor market factors, such as income, that in turn have been
shown to affect health.
Causality
Despite the potential importance of first occupation on later health, this topic has
been examined in only a small number of studies in the economics literature and no
studies have directly attempted to estimate causal effects. We are aware of only three
papers in the economics literature that have examined the effects of occupation on health
using longitudinal datasets, which allows controls for selection into occupations. Mare
(1990) uses the Older Men cohort of the National Longitudinal Study (1966) and
provides evidence that first occupation affects mortality, even controlling for later
occupational choices and a rich set of background variables. Sindelar et al. (2007 use the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics and show that first occupation is associated with selfrated health status and heart attacks in later life, controlling for pre-labor market
characteristics such as health status and other important background factors. Fletcher
(2008) uses the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) and sibling fixed effects to provide
evidence that first occupation is associated with health outcomes measured at age 50 and
near retirement. While these results are compelling, none of the studies are able to
completely address the endogeneity of occupation and some of the datasets used contain

important limitations.3 4 This current paper contributes to the small and growing literature
on the effects of first occupational choice by using a rich dataset with pre-labor market
controls as well as pursuing an instrumental variable strategy to estimate causal effects.

Data and Methodology
In this study, we use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID),
which is a representative longitudinal study that began in 1968 that focuses on economic
and demographic behaviors of individuals and households over time.5 The PSID has data
on current health as well as early health, first occupation and other information about the
family when the individual was young. These data combined with the ability to match
state level data provide the opportunity to begin to assess causality in the relationship
between first occupation and later health,
Analytic Sample. Since our primary variable of interest is initial occupational
choice, we focus on individuals in the PSID who were surveyed in the mid-90s and early
2000s, when information was gathered retrospectively on first occupation.
Approximately 8,400 individuals aged 30 and over reported a valid 3-digit census
occupational code for their first occupation. We select these older individuals to avoid
examining essentially contemporaneous data on health and occupation. As we describe
below, we use an instrumental variables strategy in some of our analyses, which also has
implications for our analysis sample. In particular, we use information from the Census
and self-reports of father’s occupation during the respondent’s childhood.
Approximately 7,500 individuals reported their father’s occupation. In order to merge the
Census data, we need information on the state the respondent grew up in, which is
available for 4,870 individuals.6 After dropping individuals with incomplete data, our

The NLS begins when individuals are ages 45-55 , collects retrospective information on occupation and
has limited pre-market controls. The WLS contains only individuals from Wisconsin in a specific cohort.
4
In a complementary literature, Oreopoulos et al. (2008) use variation in workforce entry conditions to
show that early shocks to labor demand have long term effects on income. We are not aware of any
research that uses this strategy to examine health outcomes.

Unfortunately, information on which state the respondent grew up in was only asked of heads of
households since the 1990s in the family data. This feature of the data skews our sample towards males
and single mothers due to the PSID definition of a head of household. We are able to add a few hundred
individuals to the sample, who were asked their state of birth in 1997 and 1999 but our sample is still not
representative of wives in the PSID survey. We examine this issue to some degree in our robustness

Variables. Health is self-reported in five categories that are typically used in selfreported health: poor, fair, good , very good and excellent. See Table 1 for means and
other descriptive information. From the data on current occupation, we categorize
individuals into blue collar occupations, or not. Specifically, the following occupational
categories are considered to be blue collar: craftsman, operative, laborer, farmer,
services. White collar occupational categories include: professionals, sales, managers,
and clerical. We use retrospective data on first occupation. The question asked of the
respondents is, “Thinking of your first full-time regular job, what kind of work did you
do?” These data are critical to our study and while PSID is longitudinal, there are so few
observations for which we are able to actually record data from the multiple waves (and
know that it was in fact the first job) that the retrospective data are likely the best
available for our purposes. Respondents were also asked about other aspects of their
early life, including: their health prior to age 16, their parents’ education, and whether
they smoked when they were a teenager. The standard demographic information is also
available for the respondent.
In order to construct one of our instruments, we create a Census data file using the
Census years 1940-1990 available from IPUMS.7 For each state x year8 cell, we
construct measures of the share of blue collar vs white collar employment. In particular,
we calculate the number of workers aged 15-30 in each state in each year who work in
blue collar occupations as a proportion of all workers of this age group.9 We then merge
this measure with the individuals in the PSID so that, for example, an individual who
turned 18 in Texas in 1980 would be given our constructed measure of the proportion of
workers aged 15-30 in Texas in 1980 who worked in blue collar occupations.
checks, where we present results that do not use the state of birth information and only use father’s
occupation as the instrument.

8
We linearly interpolate for years between census data points. We are aware of no other data source with
information on state x year labor shares for the years we require—from 1940-1980+.
9
We also experimented with creating differentials in average wages for this age group between blue collar
and white collar occupations in each state and year. The wage differential measures were not as strong a
predictor of first occupation as the measure we use.

7

After constructing and merging datasets, we then estimate a series of baseline and
two-stage least square empirical models of the relationship between blue collar
occupation upon work force entry and later health status. In particular, we estimate:
healthit = X it β + αOcci 0 + ε it

(1)

where the health status for individual i at time t (2001) is a function of individual level
characteristics that are predetermined at labor market entry (gender, age, race, schooling,
health from ages 0-16, maternal and paternal education, and smoking status) and whether
their first occupation was blue collar ( Occi 0 ).
We follow our baseline specification by estimating:
healthit = X it β + αOcci 0 + ε it

(2)

Occi 0 = X itδ + Z it γ + υit

(3)

where we use two instruments in the Z vector that we describe above—father’s
occupation and proportion of blue collar occupations from the Census.
Instrument Validity
We propose two instruments: father’s occupation and state employment condition
(see Oreopoulos et al. (2008) for a similar approach). In order to be valid, these variables
must be highly correlated with our endogenous variable (first occupation) and
uncorrelated with the error term in the health production function (equation (2)). It is
reasonable to imagine circumstances in which father’s occupation is directly related to his
child’s health in middle age. We attempt to control for the primary links between father’s
occupation and child’s adult health, including child’s health though adolescence, child’s
educational attainment, and child’s risk preference (proxied by smoking status). We
claim that these are the primary potential direct pathways linking father’s occupation and
child’s adult health and suggest that father’s occupation may indirectly affect child’s
adult health through affecting the child’s occupation choices, such as through providing
job contacts and occupation-specific knowledge. Thus, our implicit assumption is that
there is no residual effect of father’s occupation on the respondent’s adult health status
after controlling for parents’ education and respondent education and health endowment
except through its impact on the respondent’s occupational choice.

8

Since it is impossible to show the validity of father’s occupation as an instrument,
we take advantage of state level occupation characteristics as a second instrument, as
outlined above. Like our first instrument, we are aware that it is possible to craft stories
in which the proportion of same-aged individuals in one’s state who have blue collar
occupations at workforce entry might be correlated with unobservables in the health
production function (equation 2), such as state-level expenditures on health care or
education. Again, we attempt to minimize this possibility by controlling for the pathways
through which these variables likely affect adult health, such as educational attainments
and health during childhood. In robustness checks, we also control for state-level
educational and health characteristics10 that may be correlated with our instrument. We
find our results to be robust to these additional controls.
We assume that any other links between our state-level occupational characteristic
(percentage blue collar) and the respondent’s health is an indirect effect through
occupational choice. In particular, our state-level measure could affect occupational
choice through information channels (young people in blue collar occupations transmit
information about other blue collar opportunities) or demand factors. For example, a high
proportion of blue collar jobs available increases the probability that the individuals will
also obtain a blue collar job. The fact that a substantial proportion of the jobs in Michigan
are blue collar increases the likelihood that a new entrant will start working in a blue
collar job.
Even with our important pre-labor market controls, there may be remaining
questions of the validity of each of our instruments. Importantly, the availability of two
instruments allows us to use over-identification tests of the validity of our instruments. A
further strength of our set of instruments is that they are drawn in two different domains
(Murray, 2006 and Basu et al. 2007). Finally, we also show below that our main results
are similar if we use both instruments or use them individually, which gives us increased
confidence in our results.

10

For our state-level characteristics, we use education data from Card and Krueger (1992) on pupil-teacher
ratios, term length and teacher wages and health data from Lleras-Muney (2005) on number of hospitals
and number of physicians. We extend the Lleras-Muney health data through 1958 and use linear
interpolation for all data to fill in missing values.

Results
Table 2 presents baseline results predicting health status in 2001 for our analysis
sample11. We begin in column 1 by using standard OLS regression analysis to present
the age/sex adjusted correlation between blue collar employment at labor force entry
(henceforth “blue collar employment”) with self-reported health status.12 Results indicate
a significant decrease in self reported health status of 0.4 units. This magnitude is similar
to an increase in age of 20 years. Ordered probit results are nearly identical with our
OLS results in all analyses and are presented in Table 4A. In column 2, we add race and
education controls and show that the association between blue collar employment and
health status is reduced by half to 0.2 units, which is similar to a 10 year age increase. In
column 3, we control for our full vector of pre-labor market characteristics, and the
association is reduced by another 25% to 0.14 units—a seven year age increase, but
remains highly significant. Childhood health is a significant predictor of adult health; in
particular, reporting excellent health in childhood is highly correlated with adult health
(the omitted category is good health). Very good health as a child also increases adult
health, but the magnitude is about half that of excellent childhood health, as would be
expected. Table 3A in the appendix shows that our baseline results are similar when
estimated using our analysis sample or the full sample of individuals (some of whom we
drop because of missing data on state of birth or paternal occupation). Finally, column 4
shows that the results are robust to including state-level health and education
characteristics measured at birth and at age 15.
In Table 3, we examine the heterogeneity of the baseline results by age, race, and
gender. We find that the association between blue collar employment and health status is
50% larger for individuals ages 30 to 50 than individuals older than 50. Young males
report a larger health advantage than young females, although this is likely partly due to
the construction of the analysis sample—women in the sample are likely single mothers.
The black-white health gap seems to grow as individuals age. In columns 3 and 4 we
find that the association is greater for females than males and in columns 5 and 6 we find

measure of health outcome.

that the association between blue collar employment and health is greater for white
respondents, both in terms of significance and magnitude.
In Table 4, we attempt to estimate causal effects of blue collar employment on
health by using two instruments—state-level share of blue collar workers at age 18 and
whether the respondent’s father was in a blue collar occupation. Column 1 presents our
baseline two-staged least square results. Our instrumented results imply a stronger
relationship between blue collar employment and health status—a 0.63 unit reduction (vs.
the 0.14 reduction using OLS). As shown in the table, the F-statistics are sizable (most
over 10) and we cannot reject the validity of the instruments using over-identification
test. Like previous results, using a two-staged framework within an ordered probit
specification produced very similar results and are presented in Table 4A in the
appendix.13 In column 2, we again include state-level health and education
characteristics measured at birth and age 15; if anything, the results are slightly larger
than our baseline results. Importantly, results that only use one of the two instruments
are very similar, but have larger standard errors and are presented in appendix Table 5A.
As shown in Table 4, our IV results are substantially larger than the OLS results.
This may seem surprising because many omitted variable bias stories (e.g. ability bias)
would suggest that the IV estimates should be lower. However, our results match those
in the literature estimating schooling effects on wages or health, where IV estimates are
usually larger than OLS (Card, 1999, Currie and Moretti 2003). In principle, part of the
difference between IV and OLS results could be explained by measurement error, though
this argument may be more compelling in the schooling literature. The more likely
reason for the IV/OLS result difference is heterogeneous impacts of occupation on health.
In this case, IV estimates may exceed OLS estimates because (1) with heterogeneous
effects, the OLS estimates do not have a clear direction of bias and (2) IV estimates show
the effect of occupation on marginal individuals (LATE), which could be larger than the
effect on average (Carnerio et al. 2007, Imbens and Agrist 1994). The simple story
consistent with larger effects for the “marginal” blue collar worker is that workers likely
13

In order to generate the two stage ordered probit results, we relied on the conditional recursive mixed
process estimator (“cmp”) add-on to Stata 10. See David Roodman, 2007. "CMP: Stata module to

sort into occupations based on their multidimensional “match” with the job, which
includes the worker’s ability to absorb hazardous job conditions. Thus, it may be the
case that “marginal” workers are those that are least able to absorb job conditions that are
detrimental to health status, which would lead to larger long term declines in health
status.
In the remainder of the columns of Table 4, we find evidence that the effects of
blue collar employment increase with age, are greater for males, and may be greater for
non-white respondents, although the results stratified by race are not estimated precisely
and the instruments have only moderate strength. Differences in the impact of blue collar
by gender and race may relate to the fact that fewer whites and fewer females have blue
collar jobs. Further, it may be that characteristics of the blue collar and white collar jobs
are systematically different by race and gender, e.g. women in these cohorts were more
likely to be secretaries and teachers in the white collar jobs and were less likely to be
well-paid managers. Also, women in blue collar jobs may have had less physically
strenuous and hazardous jobs as compared to men in blue collar jobs.

Conclusions
Although there is much evidence across the social sciences to suggest that early
occupational choices could affect long term health, little research has been able to
directly examine the potential links. In this paper, we use the PSID combined with
Census information to present the first attempt to estimate a causal relationship between
blue collar employment at labor market entry and later health status. We find large
effects of blue collar employment, which are similar to aging an individual between 7 and
30 years. We also find large heterogeneity in the impact of early occupation on health,
which appear to grow with age and disproportionately affect males and minority
respondents. Our results extend the literature by using an instrumental variables strategy
in combination with direct controls for childhood health and other early family
conditions. Results from both the OLS and the IV approach suggest that interventions
that mitigate the adverse health effects of starting ones working life in a blue collar job
could be productive in enhancing health when older, ceteris paribus. While we aim to
suggest causality, however, even if this has not been incontrovertibly established, our

12

results indicate this area merits further research. A fertile area for further research could
be to investigate the mechanisms linking early labor market choices to later health as well
as examine ways to mitigate these effects.
