Social Security Programs and Retirement Around the World:
Reforms and Retirement Incentives – Introduction and Summary

ABSTRACT
This is the introduction and summary to the ninth phase of an ongoing project on Social Security
Programs and Retirement Around the World. This project, which compares the experiences of a
dozen developed countries, was launched in the mid 1990s, following decades of decline in the
labor force participation rate of older men. The first several phases of the project document that
social security program provisions can create powerful incentives for retirement that are strongly
correlated with the labor force behavior of older workers. Subsequent phases have explored how
disability program provisions affect retirement, whether there is a link between older employment
and youth unemployment, and whether older individuals are healthy enough to work longer.
In the two decades since the project began, the dramatic decline in men’s labor force participation
has been replaced by sharply rising participation rates. Older women’s participation has
increased dramatically as well. Over this same period, countries have undertaken numerous
reforms of their social security programs, disability programs, and other public benefit programs
available to older workers. In this ninth phase of the project, we explore how the financial
incentive to work at older ages has evolved from 1980 to the present. We highlight the important
role of reforms in these changing incentives and examine how changing incentives may have
affected retirement behavior.

Project Overview
Through the coordination of work of a team of analysts in twelve countries for
twenty years, the International Social Security (ISS) project has used the vast
differences in social security programs across countries as a natural laboratory to
study the effects of retirement program provisions on the labor force participation of
older persons and other questions related to the older workforce. The project’s first
several phases (Gruber and Wise, 1999, 2004, and 2007) documented the strong
relationship across countries between social security incentives and older men’s
labor force participation, confirmed this relationship in microeconomic analysis, and
estimated the labor market and fiscal implications of social security reform. Later
volumes have examined the relationship between disability insurance program
provisions, health, and retirement (Wise, 2012 and 2016) and explored whether older
employment affects youth unemployment (Gruber and Wise, 2010) and whether older
workers are healthy enough to work longer (Wise, 2017). Most recently, the project
examined recent trends in labor force participation at older ages and potential
explanations for these changes in behaviour (Coile, Milligan, and Wise, forthcoming).
In the current volume, we explore how the financial incentive to work at older ages
has evolved from 1980 to the present. We highlight the important role of reforms in
these changing incentives and examine how changing incentives may have affected
retirement behavior.
The results of the ongoing project are the product of analyses conducted for
each country by analysts in that country. Researchers who have participated in this

An important goal of the project has been to present results that are as
comparable as possible across countries. Thus the papers for each phase are
prepared according to a detailed template that we develop in close consultation with
country participants. In this introduction, we summarize the collective results of the
country analyses and focus on the combined analysis of the data from each of the
countries. The country papers themselves present much more detail for each country
and, in addition to the common analyses performed by all countries, often present
country-specific analysis relevant to each particular country.

1. Introduction: Old-age employment
While life expectancy has risen dramatically almost everywhere in the world,
the average retirement age in industrialized countries declined during much of the
20th century, putting enormous pressures on public pension systems. More recently,
however, working in later life has been making a comeback. In a striking reversal of
the earlier trend, almost all developed countries have seen substantial increases in
the employment of older workers since the mid-to-late 1990s.
This is illustrated in Figure 1 for men between ages 60 and 64. We observe a
distinct “U-shape” in the employment rate of older workers that is markedly similar
across countries. On average, employment rates for men ages 60 to 64 in these
countries rose by 14.9 percentage points between 1995 and 2016.

This is a remarkable reversal of the long-standing trend towards ever earlier
labor force exit ages, a trend which many viewed as a natural side effect of growing
prosperity and which was in contrast to the increases in life expectancy. It is also
striking that this trend has affected all countries even though the level of old-age
employment is very different across countries. France and Belgium feature relatively
low employment rates in this age group while Japan and Sweden have very high
employment rates. The trend reversal is most pronounced in Germany and the
Netherlands, and least in Japan.
Figure 2 shows the corresponding employment rate for women between ages
60 and 64. While the “U-shape” is less evident due to women’s initial low levels of
participation, the increase since the mid-1990s is similar to if not larger than that for
men, averaging 18.6 percentage points between 1995 and 2016. Again, the crossnational differences in levels of old-age employment are considerable, with Sweden
and the US at the top and Belgium and Italy at the bottom. The increase in old-age
employment among women – as for men – is strongest in Germany and the
Netherlands.

What explains these dramatic increases in employment at older ages?
Research in Coile et al. (2018) suggests that while better health, more education, and
changes in labor supply behavior of married couples may have played some role in
this trend reversal, these factors alone are insufficient to explain the magnitude of the
employment increase and its large variation across countries. At the same time,
many countries have enacted social security reforms over the past few decades that
have changed eligibility ages, actuarial adjustment factors, disability benefit eligibility,
and other parameters of public pension systems (Börsch-Supan, 2013). Coile et al.
(2018) highlight several cases where a specific reform – such as an increase in the
statutory retirement age in Japan or the UK – appears to have affected employment.
However, it is not yet well understood how much of the employment trend reversal in
this broad set of countries can be attributed to the collective effect of the many social
security reforms implemented in recent decades.
Past studies suggest that social security program provisions that affect the
financial incentive to work at older ages can exert a powerful influence on late-career
employment decisions. Gruber and Wise (1999) document that in the mid-1990s,
these incentives varied dramatically across countries and were strongly related to
employment at older ages. More specifically, they find that over 80 percent of the
differences across countries in the share of men ages 55 to 69 that were out of the
labor force could be explained by a single measure of the typical worker’s incentive to
4

work at older ages. Recent reforms are likely to have dramatically altered the
financial incentives to work at older ages, and thus may have affected employment.
The key research questions for this volume are therefore: how much has the
financial incentive to work at older ages changed between 1980 and the present as a
result of social security reforms and how much of the changes in employment over
this period can be explained by these changing incentives?
The richness of our analysis comes from both the cross-country differences in
social security policy across the twelve countries represented in this volume (US,
Canada, Japan and nine European countries) and from the inter-temporal changes in
policy that have been adopted within these countries over almost four decades. The
key question is whether differences in the incentive to work arising from this policy
variation correspond to the large variation in levels and temporal changes that we
see in old-age labor force participation among men and women in Figures 1 and 2.
This introduction starts with a brief characterization of policy changes (Section
2), introduces our key concept, the implicit tax on working longer (Section 3), and
summarizes our main results (Section 4). An extended appendix describes our
methodology in more detail, and a glossary defines the technical terms used in this
volume.
2. Policy changes
In most of the countries we study, many policy changes have occurred since
1980, and many of them are salient for changes in retirement patterns (OECD,
various issues; Social Security Administration; various issues). A remarkable
exception is the US, which has not passed a major social security reform since 1983
(although some changes mandated in the 1983 reform are still being phased in; such
phase-in periods are common, though typically of shorter duration). Some countries
have experienced major structural reforms (systemic changes) such as the
introduction of a notional defined contribution (DC) system (e.g., Sweden and Italy) or
the replacement of parts of the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system by a fully funded
system (e.g., Sweden and Germany). In some countries, changes in the private
(personal and occupational) pension sector have interacted with changes in public
programs or have otherwise influenced retirement behavior (e.g., UK and
Netherlands). In most countries, policies followed a long-term trend (e.g. gradually
increasing the retirement age as in the US), but some countries experienced an
inconsistent back and forth (e.g., raising then lowering the statutory retirement age or
increasing then decreasing benefit generosity).
This phenomenon is visible in Figure 3 where we take Germany as an
example. Germany introduced actuarial deductions for early retirement in the 1992
reform but cancelled them under certain conditions in 1997 only to re-introduce them
in 2000. Similarly, a gradual increase in the German statutory retirement age was
5

legislated in 2007 but seven years later a new pathway was created for early
retirement at age 63.
Figure 3: Policy changes affecting retirement age in Germany, 1980-2015

As a first step of our analysis, each of the twelve country chapters starts with a
description of these policy changes structured by important reform acts. These
changes may include:
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

raising or lowering the social security early or statutory eligibility ages (or
years of contributions required for early claiming of social security benefits)
introducing partial (“flexible”) retirement into social security
raising or lowering social security benefit generosity (this may include
changes to the benefit formula, the number of years of earnings used in the
benefit calculation, the use of wage vs. price indexation, etc.)
strengthening or weakening the actuarial adjustment of social security
benefits for early or delayed claiming
strengthening or weakening the earnings test
introducing a notional DC system
strengthening or weakening other public programs that offer a pathway to
retirement, including non-social security early retirement, disability
insurance, and unemployment insurance programs

These policy changes are described verbally in a consistent manner across
countries, using a common set of key words (see the glossary in the appendix). Table
1 summarizes the key policy changes. 1
1

The years listed in the table refer to when reforms were implemented, not when a reform law was
passed. A range of years indicates that the reform was phased in over time. Multiple entries in a single
cell indicate that there were multiple reforms with similar effects (e.g., that reduced benefit generosity).

6

7

Some distinct patterns emerge from Table 1. First, the table shows that the
period since 1980 has been one of great pension reform activity. Looking down each
column, it is apparent that every country has undertaken multiple types of reform –
for example, making changes to social security eligibility ages and also to non-social
security programs. Further, as seen in each row, for many broad types of changes,
half to three-quarters of the countries have implemented a change of that type over
the past thirty-five years.
Second, comparing across the various rows, it is clear there have been many
more reforms that strengthen the incentive to work at older ages than reforms that
weaken the incentive to work. Examples of the former include reducing benefit
generosity, raising eligibility ages, strengthening the actuarial adjustment, and
weakening non-social security pathways to retirement. More than half of the
countries have undertaken each of these reform types, far more than the number that
has done the opposite.
Third, the table provides more evidence of the back-and-forth reforms
described above, in that some countries have undertaken reforms of opposite types,
such as weakening and strengthening the actuarial adjustments at different points in
time. There are also countries that have undertaken multiple reforms of the same
type, suggesting that it is often necessary to make a larger change in several smaller
steps, perhaps for political reasons.
While these reforms are rather complex and not easy to quantify – pointing to
the necessity of the individual country chapters in this volume, which explain the
reforms in detail and show how they have affected the incentive for continued work at
older ages – there are some program parameters that can be more easily quantified,
such as eligibility ages.
Since 1980, changes in eligibility ages have been common. Figure 4 shows
how the social security early eligibility age (EEA) has evolved over time for men and
women in our countries. The EEA is the first age at which social security benefits are
available, often with an actuarial reduction relative to the benefits available at the
statutory eligibility age (defined below). While one country, Canada, lowered this age
from 65 to 60 for both men and women in 1987, the changes in this parameter
otherwise are all in the direction of increases. In Belgium, Germany, Japan, and the
UK, the EEA for women was initially lower than that for men, but it has been raised
(or is being raised, in the case of the UK) to the same level. The US is somewhat of
an outlier in not having raised the EEA during this period; only men in Japan and the
UK have been similarly unaffected.

8

Figure 4: Social Security Early Eligibility Age, by Sex, 1980-2016

Figure 5 shows the changes over time in the social security statutory eligibility
age (SEA). This term refers to the age at which the individual is eligible for full public
old-age pension benefits without reduction for early claiming (an age sometimes
referred to as the full or normal retirement age). Increases in the SEA have been
near universal over this period, with all countries except Canada and Sweden raising
this age. Similar to the EEA, the SEA was initially lower for women than for men in
Belgium, Italy, Japan, and the UK, but these differences are being eliminated over
time. An interesting difference from the EEA is that the SEA for men was cut in six of
the twelve countries before later being increased. Variation like this in program
parameters within a country over time may ultimately be used to help identify the
effect of social security programs on retirement.
Figure 5: Social Security Statutory Eligibility Age, by Sex, 1980-2016

Actuarial adjustments define how social security benefits relate to the claiming
age. They are usually defined as percentage adjustments and typically lower or raise
the monthly benefit amount if the worker claims benefits before or after the SEA.
Figure 6 provides information on the actuarial reduction for early claiming, plotting the
benefit available if claiming at age 62 as a share of the SEA benefit. This series is
undefined for those countries that do not have early claiming prior to the SEA, such
as the Netherlands. There are decreases in this series over time for several
countries, corresponding to a greater actuarial penalty for early claiming. In Spain,
for example, this value fell from about 80% in 2011 to under 60% in 2013. The U.S.
9

experienced a more modest decline, from 80% to 75%. At age 62, an actuarial
neutral value would have benefits reduced by about 6.5 percent per year of claiming
before the SEA (using a discount rate of 3% and average life expectancy for the 12
countries). As most countries currently have an SEA of 65 or 66, a reduction to
about 75 or 80% of the full benefit for claiming at 62 (some three to four years before
the SEA) is roughly actuarially fair.
Figure 6: Share of SEA Benefit if Claim at Age 62, by Sex, 1980-2016

Most countries feature an earnings test at ages before the SEA. This forces
individuals to stop working when they want to receive social security benefits, as
benefits are taxed, often dollar-for-dollar, against earnings (although a small amount
of earnings may be allowed without taxation). The decision to claim benefits and the
decision to exit the labor force, which are independent decisions from an individual’s
point of view, are thus intrinsically combined in these countries; this helps to explain
why the word “retirement” means both decisions in these countries. An earnings test
is currently in place before the SEA in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Japan,
Spain, and the UK; only France eliminated its earnings test during the period we
examine.
In Figure 7, we explore changes over time in the generosity of social security
benefits by reporting the median earner’s replacement rate. We focus on the net
replacement rate, which is the average annual social security benefit net of income
taxes and social contributions divided by the average annual earnings net of income
taxes and social contributions. As the figure shows, replacement rates have been
declining over time in a number of countries, although there are a few countries with
increases. In part, declining replacement rates reflect reforms that have lowered
benefit generosity – for example, increasing the number of years of earnings used in
the benefit formula (which reduces the average earnings on which benefits are based
by incorporating more low-earning years) or switching from wage indexation to price
indexation in the benefit formula. The figure also reveals large differences across
countries in the generosity of the social security program.

10

Figure 7: Replacement Rate, by Sex, 1980-2016

Note: Values calculated by authors of country chapters. The replacement rate is calculated as the
average after-tax benefit at ages 62-69 relative to the average age-tax earnings at ages 55-62 for the
median earner type (described below).

It is important to note the critical role that non-social security programs play in
decisions to retire very early in many countries. These other programs may include
disability insurance (DI), unemployment insurance (UI), and other special early
retirement programs that are distinct from the social security system. As seen in
Figure 1, many countries have reformed these other programs since 1980, often
reducing benefit generosity or tightening eligibility, for example by reducing age- or
occupation-based access to DI or long-term UI benefits. In the case of DI, Wise
(2012) concludes that such changes in program parameters are more important than
changes in health in explaining changes in DI participation over time. More details on
how these non-social security programs have changed over time are available in the
country chapters.
In summary, the past three to four decades has been a period of intense
pension reform activity. While the reform process sometimes includes a back-andforth element and not all reforms push in the same direction, the general thrust over
this period has been in the direction of raising eligibility ages, lowering benefit
generosity, strengthening actuarial adjustments for delayed claiming, and reducing
access to non-social security programs that offer alternative pathways out of the
labor force. All of these changes are expected to encourage workers to retire later.
Thus, it is critical to try to estimate how much of the trend towards higher employment
at older ages highlighted in the previous section might be driven by these substantial
changes in social security and other public programs.
3. Pension benefits and the implicit tax on working longer
The central piece of work in this volume is to condense the program
parameters discussed in the previous section into a comprehensive, one-dimensional
indicator that measures how the policy changes in Table 1 have altered the
incentives to work longer. To this end, the twelve country teams have set up social
security benefit calculators that compute the benefits from each salient social security
program (“pathway to retirement”) for a few typical benefit recipients who differ by
11

basic socio-economic characteristics (sex, marital status, and education). The main
input for the benefit calculation is the earnings history of the individual. In the set of
calculations that we focus on this in chapter, all countries use the same life-course
trajectory of net earnings and the same mortality assumptions, but country-specific
social security rules. While this is counterfactual, it separates cross-national
differences in social security policies and their changes over time from other
differences across countries or over time, e.g., differences in earnings histories and
life expectancies. The appendix precisely defines these common assumptions. In a
second set of calculations, the country chapters introduce these cross-national and
time series differences and illustrate their importance for the incentive to work at
older ages.
For each typical individual, the social security benefit calculation is done for
every year from 1980 to 2015, for every possible retirement age, and for every
pathway to retirement (such as old-age public pension, early retirement pension,
disability pensions, etc.) that is available for the individual. For simplicity and since
most countries feature earnings tests at least at ages before the SEA (Table 2), we
generally assume that retirement means both claiming social security benefits and
stopping work even in those countries in which no earnings tests are in effect. The
variation by year captures the many changes in social security laws and regulations
that occurred during this time span. The variation of social security benefits by
retirement age captures whether it was advantageous for a given type of individual in
a given country and year to retire earlier or later, something which differs greatly
across the 12 countries. Likewise, there are large differences across countries in
which pathways are available for retirement, with some pathways accessible
substantially earlier than the statutory eligibility age in the old-age pension.
A first product of this benefit calculation is the social security wealth, denoted
by SSW. It sums up the properly discounted social security benefits from the
beginning of retirement over the expected remaining life span. Postponing claiming
social security benefits by one year has two effects on social security wealth. On the
one hand, the individual receives one year less of benefits, which decreases social
security wealth. On the other hand, annual benefits increase with later claiming in
most countries due to additional contributions and actuarial adjustments. Additional
contributions accrue because the individual now works a year longer, and having an
extra year of earnings included in the benefit computation may result in a higher
benefit amount. Moreover, in almost all countries, benefits are adjusted upwardly if
benefits are taken later through the actuarial adjustment. The balance between these
mechanisms determines whether social security wealth increases or decreases with
earlier or later retirement. We call the numerical increase or decrease of social
security wealth the “accrual” of social security wealth. As we will see, this balance
has changed between 1980 and 2015, mostly in favor of later retirement.
If the accrual is negative, the social security system imposes an implicit tax on
working longer and claiming later. This is the key concept in this volume, abbreviated
12

as ITAX. The implicit tax on working longer is defined as the accrual of social security
wealth relative to the earnings of the individual. More precisely, we relate the accrual
of social security wealth when postponing retirement at a given age to the earnings
net of income taxes and social contributions that the individual will receive in this
additional year of work. A positive value of ITAX means that there is a tax on working
longer, a negative value represents a subsidy for working longer. ITAX collapses all
the various dimensions of social security policy – the discussion in the previous
section features some of them – into a single dimension. This is as much an
advantage as it is a disadvantage. The advantage is that the single dimension of
ITAX permits us to easily display associations between policy and potential outcomes
such as old-age employment or labor force participation. The obvious disadvantage
is that social security policies may be more complex and may even have
inconsistencies that are masked by a one-dimensional measure.
The main work in this volume is for each country to compute a time series for
the years 1980 to 2015 of the implicit tax rate on working longer that governs the
decision to retire and claim social security benefits at age R, where R ranges in most
countries from 55 to 69. Figure 8 displays the implicit tax on working at age 62 for a
typical man and its change from 1980 to 2015. We choose age 62 as it corresponds
roughly to the average retirement age across the 12 countries. A “typical man” has
median education and a stylized earnings history which is common for all twelve
countries. He looks forward to the median life expectancy which again is common for
all countries.

Figure 8 shows that the 12 countries described in this volume have very
different initial starting values of the implicit tax on working longer at 62 but a
common declining trend. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the implicit tax was about
35% on average (unweighted mean across all countries). In France and Japan it was
more than 75%, in Germany 35%, in the UK even negative. Despite this large
heterogeneity, there was a common trend which has reduced the implicit tax
substantially to only around 20% from 2007 onwards on average across the 12
countries, a decline of 43 percentage points. The decline is particularly steep for
Germany from a tax of about 40% in 1995 to an almost neutral value in 2013.
Figure 9 displays the change of the implicit tax on working longer for a woman
of age 62 with median education, earnings and life expectancy.

The implicit tax rates on working longer for women are similar to those for
men. The decrease from 1980 to 2015 is a bit larger: the average tax rate across the
12 countries was almost 50% in 1988 and only 15% in 2015.
In Figure 10, we plot ITAX by age for each country, separately for men and
women, in order to show the incentives to work across the full age range 55 to 69
(and not just at age 62, as in the previous figures). In most cases, the implicit tax on
working longer rises with age, which is consistent with declining employment at older
ages; Denmark and Sweden are notable exceptions to this pattern.
As we include series for three points in time (1980, 2000, and 2014), these
figures also illustrate how ITAX is changing over time. Although the patterns can be
complex, in many cases the implicit tax in 2014 is lower than that in 1980. More
specifically, the tax rate is more or less lower at every age in Germany, Italy, Japan,
the Netherlands, Spain, and the US, falling by 40 to 60 percentage points in most of
these cases. In Canada, Sweden, and the UK, the tax rate is lower at some ages
and higher at others in 2014 as compared to 1980. The case of France is interesting
because very early retirement (i.e., claiming benefits before age 60) was strongly
incentivized by high implicit taxes in 1980; due to the reversal of this policy, France
now has higher tax rates at older ages than it did in 1980. Belgium is the only country
where the tax rate at all ages was higher in 2014 than it was in 1980.

The country chapters show that incentives vary also with other socio-economic
characteristics, e.g. education and the resulting earnings profiles. In this volume, we
compute social security benefits and their implicit tax on working longer only for a
small set of synthetic types of individuals that are standardized across countries,
following a strict set of rules that are described in the methodological appendix of this
introduction. In future work, we will apply the benefit calculators to real survey data in
order to capture the full heterogeneity of life circumstances.
4. The association between employment and the implicit tax on working longer
The last step of the analyses in the twelve country chapters is to juxtapose the
changes in the incentive variable ITAX with the actual change in old-age
employment. Figure 11 shows this for all participating countries, separately for men
and women. Each panel has the employment rate for a specific age group on the
vertical axis and the corresponding ITAX on the horizontal axis. The three age groups
(55-59, 60-64 and 65-69) are drawn in different colors; a selection of years is
indicated by the size of the dots. Most countries show a negative association; most
clearly in Germany and Canada and for Dutch men and US women. This is the
expected correlation: a higher implicit tax on claiming later and not contributing longer
makes working longer a costly decision since social security wealth is lost by claiming
benefits later. The historical reduction of the implicit taxes by the various social
security reforms in many countries, visible in Figures 8 and 9, has made working
longer more attractive again.
Not all countries exhibit such systematic associations as seen in the above
four examples. In the UK, there is no correlation visible and it is positive in Sweden.
There are many reasons why the negative association is weak or not observable in
some countries. ITAX is one-dimensional and may not fully capture important aspects
of the national social security system such as changes in the earnings tests and
changes in labor regulations. In some countries, policies have been inconsistent
and/or quickly changing. Moreover, an average ITAX and an average employment
rate across a heterogeneous population with different macroeconomic developments
(service industry vs. manufacturing) and different regulations in some sectors (civil
servants, heavy industry) may not capture the appropriate outcome and correct
incentives for important subgroups of the population. Finally, employment of older
workers may be driven by other factors than social security regulations, e.g.,
employment in Spain suffered most from the financial crisis among our twelve
countries.

Nevertheless, the overall evidence is quite clear. Table 2 summarizes the data
in Figure 11 by a set of country-specific linear regressions, separately for men and
women and by the main early retirement age range 60-64 and the main late
retirement age range 65-69. The dependent variable is the employment rate in a
country for that age range and year which is regressed on ITAX and social security
wealth (SSW) for that age range and year, stratified by the three education
categories. The unit of observation is thus an education group-year, although only
the ITAX and SSW measures (and not the employment rate) vary by education. We
include SSW to account for life-time income effects. We also include dummies for the
three education groups. Table 2 only reports the 48 coefficients and their t-statistics
relating to ITAX that have been obtained from the 48 country-specific regression
equations. Two thirds of the coefficients are negative and almost half are negative
and statistically significant at the conventional level (p<0.01). 2 The results are much
stronger for the younger age range (age 60-64) for both women and men.

Note: The Netherlands provided only data for males in the 60-64 age range.

Condensing the evidence even further, Table 3 provides a pooled regression
across all countries and the entire observation period, again separately for men and
women and the early and late retirement age range. The unit of observation is now
country-year-education group. The dependent and explanatory variables are the
same as in Table 2; in addition, we included country fixed effects to account for the
different levels of employment in the 12 participating countries. Table 3 now lists all
coefficients and their t-statistics. The coefficients for the ITAX variable show the
statistically highly significant and economically strong relation between the incentive
2

There regression results may differ from those in the country chapters. For example, in the case of
the UK, the coefficient on ITAX for men is negative and statistically significant in the country chapter.
The difference likely arises because that analysis uses data on ITAX and employment that varies by
single year of age, education group, and year, rather than the more aggregated data we use here.

to work longer and the employment rate in the younger age range (age 60-64).
Increasing the implicit tax on working longer from 0% to 100% reduces the
employment of older men by 6.7 percentage points in the early retirement phase, for
women by 4.6 percentage points. The effect is much smaller in the older age range
(age 65-69) (1.8 and 0.3 percentage points for mean and women, respectively) and is
insignificant for women. In general, individuals with high SSW – corresponding to
higher lifetime income – have a higher employment rate although this is not true of
men in the earlier age range. The country dummies reflect the level of employment,
which is particularly low in Belgium and high in Japan, Sweden, and – especially for
women – in the US.

In conclusion, there is suggestive evidence for the expected negative
association between old-age employment rates and implicit taxes on working longer.
The correlations, however, should be interpreted with care. While they suggest a
causal influence of incentives on retirement behavior, there are also competing
explanations that need to be rules out. For instance, the underlying populations are
heterogeneous and their composition may have changed. Moreover, many
macroeconomic changes took place over the four decades considered. The next step
in this project is therefore to employ micro data in a formal regression analysis which
will take care of other changes over time.

5. Summary and conclusions
We have collected data on changes in social security laws and regulations
between 1980 and 2015 in 12 countries around the globe: 9 European countries, the
US and Canada, and Japan. We have computed the incentive to claim later and work
longer from these laws and regulations and expressed it as the loss of social security
wealth when claiming later and working longer divided by the earnings in that
additional year of work. We call this the implicit tax on working longer.
While the countries differ greatly in the level of this implicit tax and its changes
over time, we find a clear and common trend: the average of the implicit tax has
declined substantially from the 1980s to 2016. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the
implicit tax on working longer was about 35% on average (unweighted mean across
all countries of the tax rate at age 62) for men. In France and Japan it was more than
75%, in Germany 35%, in the UK even negative. Despite this large heterogeneity,
there was a common trend which has reduced the implicit tax substantially to only
around 20% from 2007 onwards on average across the 12 countries, a decline of 43
percent. The implicit tax rates on working longer for women are similar to those for
men, with an even larger decrease between 1980 and 2015: the average tax rate
across the 12 countries was almost 50% in 1988 and only 15% in 2015.
We then related this decline in the implicit tax on claiming later and working
longer to the actual change in the employment rate. From our country-specific
regressions, two thirds of the coefficients are negative, and almost half of them
negative and statistically significant. The results of a pooled regression are even
stronger and show a statistically significant and economically strong relation between
the incentive to work longer and the employment rate for men and for younger
women. Increasing the implicit tax on working longer from 0% to 100% reduces the
employment of older men by 6.7 percentage points in the early retirement phase and
1.8 percentage points in the late retirement phase. The equivalent effect for women
in the early retirement phase is 4.6 percentage points.
Overall, our findings in this volume support the hypothesis that social security
reforms over the past several decades have strengthened the incentives for work at
older ages, and that the resulting increase in the financial incentive to work at older
ages contributed to the rise in employment at older ages during this period. In future
work, we will employ microdata to conduct regression analyses within and across our
countries, which will allow for more accurate and causally interpretable
measurements of the incentives facing individual workers and for a comparison of the
relative effects of social security incentives and other factors on retirement.
