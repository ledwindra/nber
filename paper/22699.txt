JEL No. F41,F43
ABSTRACT
This paper evaluates the relation between house prices and economic growth. Using a dataset that
covers house prices for 19 countries from the first quarter of 1975 to the third quarter of 2013. We
find that house price appreciations are positively associated with economic growth, while the relation
between house price depreciations and economic growth is highly non-linear, depending on country-specific
characteristics. In the absence of concurrent banking crisis, large house price depreciations (rather
than prolonged and modest ones) are positively associated with economic growth. We also find that
the positive association between house price depreciations and economic growth is more pronounced
in countries with civil-law legal systems, in countries without mortgage insurance or personal bankruptcy
law.

1. Introduction
House price appreciations contribute to the economic growth through increasing household consumption
(i.e. via the wealth effect, see Mian, Gao and Sufi, 2013, Mian and Sufi, 2014) and firm investment beyond new
housing construction (i.e. via the network or collateral effect, see Acemoglu, Carvalho, Ozdaglar and Tahbaz‐
Salehi, 2012, Chaney, Sraer and Thesmar, 2012). Large house price appreciations, however, can lead to
overinvestment (Miao, Wang and Zhou, 2015), which crowd out the funding supply to more productive sectors
and reduce economic output (Chakraborty, Goldstein, and MacKinlay, 2016). The eventual house price
depreciations tend to happen with tightening credit conditions due to falling collateral value, declining realestate related employment and deteriorating consumption demand. The large depreciations that follow prolong
appreciations can potentially reduce capital market distortion and improve investment efficiency, which
subsequently enhances economic growth via reducing existing economic slack (Lau and Zheng, 2015).
Understanding the dynamics of house prices and economic growth is the objective of this paper.
To study the relation between economic growth and house valuations, we look at house prices in a panel of
19 countries from the first quarter of 1975 to the third quarter of 2013. In the econometric analyses, we find that
there is a positive relation between house price appreciations and economic growth. Interestingly, the eventual
house price depreciation has a non-linear relationship with economic growth. Similar to Jordà, Schularick and
Taylor (2015a), we find that house price cycles can be costly if it is accompanied by a banking crisis. In the
absence of a banking crisis, a large house price depreciation (rather than a prolonged and modest one) is
associated with a stronger economic output and productivity growth. This result is consistent with the finding
by Mian, Sufi and Trebbi (2015) that economic activity recovers faster after a larger decline in house prices,
driven by more foreclosure by delinquent homeowners. We also find that the positive relation between large

house price depreciations and economic output growth is more pronounced in countries with a civil law system,
and without mortgage insurance or personal bankruptcy law.
This paper is related to Mian, Sufi and Trebbi (2015) who use the U.S. household level data to evaluate the
impact of house prices on economic activity. We extend their exercise to an international context using countrylevel data and find similar evidence that a country’s economic output grows faster when its house price
undergoes sharp and deep corrections. The new evidence adds to the existing literature that study the dynamic
interaction between house price shocks and global macroeconomic fluctuations (Beltratti and Morana 2010;
Musso, Neri, and Stracca, 2011; Jordà, Schularick and Taylor, 2015b). This paper is also related to Borio,
Disyatat, and Juselius (2015), who find that credit conditions and property prices explain the cyclical variations
of output gap in the U.S. significantly, and Miller, Peng, and Sklarz (2011), who find that houses prices affect
aggregate economic growth using U.S. metropolitan data. While these studies focus on the U.S. market, we
offer cross-country evidence on the relation between house valuations and economic growth. Moreover, we
document a positive linkage between large house depreciations and economic growth, which may channel
through increasing capital allocation efficiency (Borensztein and Lee, 2002; Caballero, Hoshi and Kashyap,
2008) and labour mobility (Donovan and Schnure, 2011; Schulhofer-Wohl, 2011). These new findings have
important policy implications for managing bursting house bubbles.
The remainder of this paper as organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data, Section 3 presents the
results, Section 4 explores the implications of house price cycles on aggregate economic growth, Section 5
discusses the possible mechanisms that drive the positive relation between large house price depreciations and
economic growth, and Section 6 concludes.

2. Data
House price data come from The Economist’s house-price index1. Our estimation sample includes quarterly
house prices in real terms and price-to-rent ratios for 19 countries (both OECD and non-OECD) from the first
quarter of 1975 to the third quarter of 2013. We look at two measures: House Price Return (𝐻𝑃𝑅𝑖,𝑡 ), a threeyear cumulative return on real house price index in country i at period t, and House Price to Rent Ratio (PRR),
which is calculated as a three-year cumulative change on real price-to-rent ratio. Housing market related policies,
including maximum loan to value ratio (LTV), mortgage subsidies/insurance, personal bankruptcy law, are
drawn mainly from Shim, Bogdanova, Shek and Subelyte (2013).
Country-level macroeconomic variables come from IMF’s International Financial Statistics and Bank for
International Settlements (BIS). A set of dependent variables includes real GDP growth, per capita GDP growth,
and total factor productivity growth. In addition to house prices, we also include a set of control variables: (i)
Log(initialGDP), the log of real GDP lagged by one year; (ii) Investment, the annual return on the gross capital
formation to GDP calculated as the log difference in the gross capital formation to GDP between current quarter
and the same quarter of last year; (iii) Unemployment, the annual change in the log of unemployment rate; (iv)
Inflation, the annual change in the log of CPI index; (v) GovExp, the nominal government consumption divided
by the nominal GDP; (vi) TradeOpenness, the sum of nominal exports and imports as a ratio of the nominal
GDP; and (vii) Credit, the domestic credit to private sector divided by GDP. Appendix Table A1 summarizes
the data sources and variable definitions in details.
On aggregate, we have 1,920 common country-quarter observations for our regressions. The sample starts
from the first quarter of 1978 (the first three year observations are dropped when calculating HPR and PRR).

The data is available from http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/11/global-house-prices. The original data

covers 21 countries, Singapore and China are excluded from the final sample due to the lack of quarterly data on trade and
inflation in International Financial Statistics.

Table 1 reports summary statistics of these variables. House price appreciations are more frequent and larger in
size than house price depreciations: there are 1,212 country-quarter episodes of housing price appreciations with
an average HPR of 17%, and 718 episodes of housing price depreciations with an average HPR of -11%.

3. Results
3.1. Baseline Estimation
To estimate the association between economic growth and house prices, we use the following specification:
𝑦𝑖,𝑡 = θ ∙ 𝐻𝑃𝑅𝑖,𝑡 + γ ∙ |𝐻𝑃𝑅𝑖,𝑡 | ∙ 𝐷𝑖,𝑡 + Β ∙ Λ 𝑖,𝑡 + δ ∙ Country𝑖 + Quarter𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 ,

(1)

where we denote 𝑦 for economic growth, HPR for house price return for country i, and time period t (quarterly).
House price depreciation variable, 𝐷𝑖,𝑡 , is a dummy variable identifying the degree of house price depreciation:
DHPR <0, (DHPR <m, or Dm≤HPR <0) is equal to one if HPR is negative (lower than median of HPR depreciation, or
i,t

i,t

i,t

higher than the median of HPR depreciation), and zero otherwise. The main independent variable is the
interaction between HPR and house price depreciation dummy. To differentiate between house price
appreciations and depreciations, we use the absolute of house price return |𝐻𝑃𝑅𝑖,𝑡 | in the regression. The
coefficient of the interaction term, γ, thus captures the linkage between house price depreciations and economic
growth, relative to that between house price appreciations and economic growth. A positive value of γ suggests
that house price depreciations are more positively associated with economic growth than house price
appreciations.
We also include other explanatory variables (Λ) in the regressions. First, we control for the initial level of
economic development proxied by Log(InitialGDP) as well as the growth of capital and labor, captured,
respectively, by the annual log change in gross capital formation as a ratio to GDP (Investment) and the log
change in unemployment rate (Unemployment). These variables account for growth in factor inputs influencing

output growth. Following the literature, we also control for Inflation, captured by the annual change in the log
of consumer price index (CPI); the level of TradeOpenness of an economy, defined as the ratio of the exports
plus imports to GDP; the ratio of government expenditure to GDP (GovExp), and bank credit to private sector
as a ratio of GDP (Credit). All the level variables (TradeOpenness, GovExp, and Credit) are lagged by four
quarters in the estimation. Also included in the regression is country and quarter fixed-effects, where Quarter
takes the value of 1, 2, 3 or 4. The standard errors of the estimated coefficients allow for clustering of
observations by quarter.
Using Equation (1) as the baseline specification, Table 2 reports estimation results of the relation between
real GDP growth and house prices. Column 1 indicates that the economic growth is positively associated with
house price returns. As we differentiate the house price returns into depreciation (HPR < 0) and appreciation
(HPR > 0), we find that the association is highly non-linear: in absolute term, there is some evidence that both
house price appreciations and depreciations are positively associated with economic growth. The result in
column (2) suggests that a 1% house price appreciation is associated with 2.3 basis points increase in the
economic growth, while the house price depreciation of the same size is positively associated with 1.7 basis
points increase in the economic growth [the number 1.7 basis point is calculated as |𝐻𝑃𝑅| ∗
(γ − θ)=1%*(4.00-2.26)].
Motivated by Mian, Sufi and Trebbi (2015), who show that large and moderate house price depreciations
have asymmetric impacts on economic activity, we differentiate further the house price depreciations into large
depreciations and moderate depreciations; i.e. whether the negative HPR is lower (that is, more negative) or
higher than the median value of the negative HPR. Based on Table 1, a country-quarter housing price
observation is considered a large depreciation if it drops by more than 9.4% over three years, and moderate
depreciation otherwise. Interestingly, the estimation results in Table 2 columns (3) and (4) suggest that only

large depreciations are positively associated with the economic growth. More specifically, a large depreciation
of 10% is associated with 14 basis points increase in the real GDP growth. In Appendix Table A2, we also
differentiate the large appreciations with moderate appreciations, but find no evidence of an asymmetric relation
with economic growth.
The association between economic growth and other controls are as expected and in line with previous
studies; countries with lower initial GDP, more investment and less unemployment rate are found to have higher
economic growth; less trade openness is associated with higher growth, which is in line with Yanikkaya, (2003);
less financially developed economies are associated with higher economic growth, consistent with Alfaro,
Chanda, Kalemli-Ozcan and Sayek (2004). Overall, the baseline estimation can explain about half of the
variation in the growth rates across countries as suggested by the R-squared.
3.2. Endogeneity Issues
The ordinary least square (OLS) estimation results in Table 2 provide evidence that house price
appreciations and large depreciations are positively associated with the real GDP growth. In this section, we
address potential feedback from economic growth to housing prices; i.e. house price appreciates following
strong economic growth. In addition, the relation observed from Table 2 may be spurious if we omit common
variables that affect both house prices and economic growth. Both reverse causality and omitted variables could
result in the OLS estimated coefficients being biased and inconsistent. To address these concerns, we employ
an instrumental variable (IV) approach. We use the three-year cumulative change in the price-to-rent ratios,
PRR, to instrument house price returns, HPR. Almeida, Campello, and Liu (2006) find price-to-rent ratio to be
an important determinant of house prices. Further, it is plausible that price-to-rent ratios can affect the economic
growth mostly through house prices. Therefore, the excluded instrument PRR should satisfy the relevance and
exogenous criteria.

Together with the coefficient estimates from the first and second stage regressions, Table 3 reports the Fstatistics and p-value of Endogeneity Test under the null hypothesis that HPR are exogenous: they clearly reject
the null hypothesis at 1% significance level, supporting the use of IV approach. The endogenous regressor, HPR,
as well as its interactions with large and moderate depreciation dummy variables are instrumented with PRR
together with its interactions with the two depreciation dummy variables. Columns (1) - (3) provide the firststage regressions, using two-stage least square (2sls) methods. It shows that the excluded instruments are
significantly associated with HPR and the interaction terms. The under-identification test reports the
Kleibergen-Paap rank LM statistic and its corresponding p-value under the null hypothesis that the instrumental
variable is not relevant: it rejects the null hypothesis that the excluded instruments are not relevant at 5%
significance level. The weak-identification test reports a Kleibergen-Paap rank Wald F-statistic of 7.5. Given
that the Stock-Yogo weak ID test critical value at 10% maximum IV size is 7.03, the F-statistic rejects the null
hypothesis that the IV is a weak instrument. These test statistics support our choices of the instruments.
Column (4) of Table 3 reports the second-stage estimation results. It shows that house price appreciations
and large depreciations remain positively and significantly related to the real GDP growth. Moreover, coefficient
estimates from the IV estimation is larger than that the estimates from OLS: 10% house price depreciation
increases the real GDP growth by 30 basis points in the IV, compared to 14 basis points in the OLS regression.
For moderate house price depreciation, the estimate has become negative and insignificant. In particular, an 8%
depreciation in housing prices is associated with 35 basis point decline in real GDP growth [calculated as
8%*(6.44-2.07)]. Such a result is however not significant.

3.3. Cross-Sectional Heterogeneity
We next delve further into the cross-sectional differences in the relation between house valuations and

economic growth. Table 4 reports the second-stage estimation results based on the 2sls method, accounting for
differences across countries with additional country-specific characteristics. All regressions are controlled for
country and quarter fixed-effects. Across various specifications, the estimated coefficients of HPR and
|HPR|*DHPR<m are both positive and statistically significant, while that of |HPR|*Dm<HPR<0 is negative but
insignificant. The results are consistent with our earlier findings that house price appreciations and large house
price depreciations are positively associated with economic growth. The estimated coefficients for other control
variables included in Table 3 remain consistent (not reported for brevity).
Additional country-specific characteristics included in this set of estimation are in order. Columns (1) of
Table 4 report the estimation results that account for institutional characteristics, measured by CommonLaw that
equals to 1 if the country is in the common-law system as recorded in Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny
(1998), and zero otherwise. The estimated coefficient of the interaction term |HPR|*DHPR<m*CommonLaw is
statistically significant and negative, suggesting that large house price depreciations is less associated with
economic growth in common law legal framework than in civil law legal framework. In particular, a 10%
depreciation in house prices is associated with 60 basis points increase in the real GDP growth in countries with
civil law legal framework (the estimated coefficient of |HPR|*DHPR<m 7.98 minus the estimated coefficient of
HPR 1.96, multiplied by the magnitude of depreciation 10%), but only related to 3 basis point increases of the
real GDP growth in countries with common law legal framework [calculated as (7.98-1.96-5.71)*10%]. As the
civil law systems tend to provide relatively weak legal protection for investors as compared to the common law
systems (Porta, et al., 1998), our results seem to suggest a stronger relationship between larger house price
depreciations and economic growth in countries with weaker safety nets.
Columns (2) and (3) report the regressions that account for the availability of mortgage insurance and
personal bankruptcy law, respectively. The dummy MI takes a value of 1 if the government provides mortgage

insurance in country i at period t. The PBL is also a dummy that equals to 1 if there is personal bankruptcy law
in country i at period t. Both interaction terms |HPR|*DHPR<m*MI and |HPR|*DHPR<m*PBL are statistically
significant and negative, suggesting stronger relation between large depreciations and economic growth in
countries that do not provide mortgage insurance or personal bankruptcy law. As the provision of mortgage
insurance and personal bankruptcy law strengthens the cushion against large house price depreciations, the
results support our previous argument that the relation between large depreciations and economic growth is
stronger in countries with weaker safety nets.
Column (4) report results that account for housing policy, using the national requirement on maximum loan
to value ratio (LTV), based on Almeida et al. (2004), as a proxy. The dummy variable LTV<0.8 takes a value of
1 if the maximum LTV ratio is less than 80% (that is, the minimum down payment is more than 20%). The
interaction term |HPR|*DHPR<m*LTV<0.8 is negative but not statistically significant. Column (5) explore whether
the results differ between OECD and non-OECD countries. The interaction term |HPR|*DHPR<m*OECD, where
OECD is a dummy that equals to 1 for OECD countries, is positive but not statistically significant. Column (6)
reports results that account for a concurrent banking crisis. The dummy variable Crisis equals to 1 if there is a
banking crisis, as identified in Laeven and Valencia. (2013), and 0 otherwise. The interaction term
|HPR|*DHPR<m*Crisis is statistically significant and negative, indicating that the positive relation between large
depreciations and growth becomes weaker in the presence of the banking crises. In fact, when there is a banking
crisis, the relation between large depreciations and economic growth becomes trivial and insignificant.
To summarize, the positive relation between large depreciations and economic growth is more pronounced
in countries with civil-law legal systems, in countries without mortgage insurance or personal bankruptcy law,
and in countries without a concurrent banking crisis.
3.4. Alternative Measures of Growth

To check for the robustness of our results, we use two alternative measures of economic growth: Per Capita
GDP Growth (the change in log of annual GDP per capita) and Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth (the
Solow residual). Columns (1) and (3) provide estimation results based on OLS using, respectively, GDP per
capita growth and TFP growth as the alternative dependent variables. All regressions control for countryspecific time-varying characteristics as well as country and quarter fixed-effects (not reported). For both
alternative measures of economic growth, our main results remain robust: both house price appreciations and
large house price depreciations are positively related to economic growth. Columns (2) and (4) provide the
second-stage estimation results based on 2sls. The under-identification tests reject the null hypothesis that the
excluded instruments are not relevant at 5% significance level. The weak-identification tests reject the null
hypothesis that the excluded instruments are weakly identified. Both tests support the use of price-to-rent ratio
(PRR) and its interactions with depreciation dummies as the excluded instruments and their statistical relevance.
The 2sls estimation results suggest that large depreciations are positively associated with growth in GDP per
capita as well as TFP: we infer from the results that a 10% housing price depreciation is associated with 43 basis
points growth in GDP per capita and 38 basis points growth in TFP.
Based on Table 3 and 5, Figure 1 summarizes the relation between different measures of economic growth
and 1% marginal increment in house price appreciations, moderate depreciations, and large depreciations.
Regardless of which growth measures are used, house appreciations and large depreciations are associated with
higher economic growth.
3.5. Additional Controls
To mitigate the concern of spurious relation between house valuations and economic growth caused by
omitted variables, we control for additional variables. Table 6 reports the second-stage result based on 2sls
estimation. We find that including the lag of HPR, the lag of GDP growth, or both, does not affect our main

results. Throughout the various specifications, the estimated coefficient of HPR remains positive and
statistically significant. The estimated coefficients of the interaction between |HPR| and large house price
depreciation dummy remains positive and statistically significant. With the exception of column (6) when the
one-quarter lagged HPR and real GDP growth are included, the estimated coefficient of |HPR|* DHPR<m is
greater than that of HPR, further suggesting a positive linkage between large house price depreciations and
economic growth.
3.6. Plausibly Exogenous IV
The results that both house price appreciations and large depreciations are positively related to economic
growth are robust across different estimation methods, different measures of growth, and alternative
specifications. Nonetheless, the excluded instrument PRR may still be imperfect, it may affect the economic
growth directly or through channels other than house valuations that are neither documented in existing literature
nor easily observable. We shall, therefore, take caution in interpreting the causality running from house
valuations to economic growth.
To further check the robustness of the results, we take into considerations that the excluded IV may not
satisfy the exogenous criteria. In particular, we verify the results using the methodology in Conley, Hansen and
Rossi (2012), allowing the excluded IV to be not entirely exogenous. Table 7 reports the second stage estimation
results under flexible (plausibly exogenous) conditions based on the union of confidence intervals approach.
We find that our main findings on the association between house valuations and economic growth remain
consistent for all three measures of economic growth. Specifically, a 10% house price appreciation is associated
with 35, 29 and 22 basis points increase in real GDP growth, per capita GDP growth and TFP growth while a
10% house price depreciation is associated with 21, 33 and 18 basis points increase in the growth of real GDP,
per capita GDP and TFP, respectively.

4. Implications on Economic Growth
According to Bracke (2013), the average duration of housing appreciations in a housing cycle, deﬁned as
the time interval between a trough and a peak, is 24.1 quarters or approximately 6 years, and the average duration
of housing depreciations, defined as the time interval between a peak and a trough is 18.2 which is about 5 years.
In our sample, the average size of house price appreciations and depreciations over three years are 17% and 11%
respectively (see Table 1). If the housing market appreciates 17% per three years (or 5.4% per year) for the first
6 years, and then depreciates sharply at 11% per three years in the 5 years that follows, the total contribution of
a typical housing cycle to GDP growth is about 3.8% based on the estimation results in Table 3.2 Based on the
2sls estimation results in Table 5, such a housing cycle would be associated with 4.5% and 3.6% increment in
GDP per capita growth and TFP growth. If the house price depreciates slowly, say at 4% per three years over
the 5-year downturn periods, a typical housing cycle would have to be associated with 1%, 1.8% and 1.9%
increase in the real GDP growth, GDP per capita growth and the TFP growth respectively.
Based on the estimation results, we calculate the contribution of housing price dynamics to economic
outputs in terms of growth in GDP, GDP per capita, and TFP. In particular, for each country-quarter, we multiply
HPR with the difference of the estimated coefficient of HPR and its two interaction terms |HPR|*DHPR<m and
|HPR|*D0<HPR<0 based on two-stage least square as reported in Table 3 and 5 to calculate the economic
significance of the relation between house prices and economic growth. Table 8 presents the average annual
association between housing valuations and economic growth for each country. Figure 2 illustrates the average

2

It is calculated as [17%*2.07*6+11%*(5.06-2.07) *5]/100=3.76%, where 2.07 is the estimated coefficient of
HPR and 5.06 is the estimated coefficient of |HPR|*DHPR<m in Table 3. The difference between 5.06 and 2.07
measures the relation between large depreciations and economic growth. More precise calculations that simulate
the growth of housing prices and its cumulative association with growth yield similar results. For example, the
compounded cumulative return is (1+17%*2.07/100)6*(1+11%*(5.06-2.07)/100)5-1=3.82%.

relation between housing valuations and real GDP growth for each country. Such a relation is the strongest in
Hong Kong, translating housing valuations into the economic growth of 6.7 to 81 basis points per year: in the
absence of housing price cycles, the economic growth in Hong Kong would have been lower by 67 to 81 basis
points per year. If cumulated over several years, this can have a significant implication on its long-term
economic growth. On average, the housing price cycles add 26 to 35 basis points to economic growth annually.
Note that, given our sample periods, the contribution of housing valuations to economic growth in German and
Japan is negative, although the magnitude is comparatively small.
5. Discussion
It is intuitive that house price appreciations are positively related to the economic growth as they increase
the consumption and investment both directly (captured by the inputs in the control variable) and indirectly
(Mian, Gao and Sufi, 2013; Mian and Sufi, 2014; Acemoglu, Carvalho, Ozdaglar and Tahbaz‐Salehi, 2012;
Chaney, Sraer and Thesmar, 2012). While large house price depreciations are associated with lower levels of
consumption and investment that undermine economic growth, it can trigger financial and labour market
restructuring that benefits growth. According to Borensztein and Lee (2002), credit is reallocated to more
efficient firms after a crisis. One can, therefore, expect a credit market reshuffle that direct investment flows
from real estate to more productive sectors following a sharp and deep correction in the housing market as
captured by the large depreciations episodes, which improves the long-term economic growth. Moreover, in
countries where zombie lending distorts capital allocation and depresses growth (Caballero, Hoshi and Kashyap,
2008), steep housing prices corrections may force zombie firms out of the market, which allows banks to lend
more efficiently than committing loans to unproductive zombie firms. In this sense, large depreciations can be
related to higher economic growth through improving banking efficiency. Finally, large depreciations can
benefit economic growth through improving labor mobility. According to Donovan and Schnure (2011) and

Schulhofer-Wohl (2011), underwater mortgages provide greater incentive for households to relocate from a
relatively poor to a better labor market, which improves labor mobility. Large depreciations that increase the
number and magnitude of underwater mortgages, therefore, enhance labor mobility and subsequently economic
growth.

6. Conclusion
Our empirical study suggests that house price appreciations are positively associated with economic growth,
while the relation between house price depreciations and economic growth is highly non-linear, depending on
country-specific characteristics. In the absence of concurrent banking crisis, large house price depreciations are
positively associated with economic growth. We also find that the positive linkage between house price
depreciations and economic growth is more pronounced in countries with relatively weak safety nets, the
presence of a civil law system, provision of mortgage insurance and existence of personal bankruptcy law.
