Competition and Bank Liquidity Creation

NBER Working Paper No. 22195
April 2016
JEL No. G21,G28,G32,G38
ABSTRACT
Does an intensification of competition among banks increase or decrease liquidity creation? By
integrating the dynamic process of interstate bank deregulation that lowered barriers to
competition across U.S. states over the 1980s and 1990s with the gravity model of the geographic
expansion of banks, we construct time-varying measures of the competitive pressures facing each
individual bank. We find that regulatory-induced competition reduced liquidity creation.
Consistent with some theories, we also find that the liquidity-destroying effects of competition
are mitigated among more profitable banks and heightened among smaller banks.

1. INTRODUCTION
Liquidity creation is a vital service that banks provide to the economy. They create
liquidity by using relatively liquid liabilities, such as demand deposits, to fund relatively
illiquid assets, such as business loans. This simultaneously satisfies the demand for liquidity
by savers and the demand for longer-term financing commitments by firms (Bryant, 1980;
Diamond and Dybvig, 1983; Gatev and Strahan, 2006). Banks also create liquidity off the
balance sheet by providing loan commitments and standby letters of credit that allow firms to
develop and modify long-run investment strategies efficiently (Boot, Greenbaum, and Thakor
1993; Holmstrom and Tirole, 1998; Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein, 2002). By creating liquidity,
theory suggests that banks improve the allocation of capital and accelerate economic growth
(Bencivenga and Smith, 1991; Levine, 1991). Empirically, Berger and Sedunov (2016) find
that the positive impact of liquidity creation on economic growth is larger than the growth
effects of other services provided by banks.
Given the importance of liquidity creation, there is surprisingly little empirical work on
the factors shaping liquidity creation. Indeed, it is only recently that Berger and Bouwman
(2009) created the first comprehensive measures of liquidity creation, which include data on
all asset-side, liability-side, and off-balance sheet activities for U.S. banks over the period
from 1993 to 2003. With these data, they examine the connection between capital regulations
and liquidity creation. Cornett, et al (2011), Berger, Makaew, and Turk-Ariss (2015), and
Peydro, Polo, and Sette (2016) examine how liquidity creation changes when banks are under
financial duress.
In this paper, we evaluate whether U.S. bank regulatory reforms that intensified
competition among banks increased, decreased, or had no effect on liquidity creation. While
researchers have actively studied the impact of regulatory-induced competition on bank
risk-taking, efficiency, and valuations (e.g., Jayaratne and Strahan, 1998; Hellmann et al.,
2000; Boyd and De Nicolo, 2005; Goetz, Laeven, and Levine, 2013, 2016; and Houston et al.,
2010), we are unaware of any previous research on how competition shapes liquidity creation.
Theory offers differing perspectives on the impact of competition on bank liquidity
creation. One strand of research suggests that competition reduces liquidity creation by

2

lowering the risk absorption capacity of banks. There are two building blocks to this view.
First, by squeezing profit margins and depleting buffers against losses (Jayaratne and Strahan,
1998), competition can induce banks to reduce risk-taking (Boyd and De Nicolo, 2005;
Peydro, Polo, and Sette 2016). Second, liquidity creation is risky, i.e., banks tend to suffer
losses if they must quickly dispose of illiquid assets to meet the demands of those holding
liquid liabilities (Allen and Santomero 1998; Allen and Gale 2004). Thus, competition can
induce banks to lower their risks by reducing liquidity creation. A second strand of research
suggests that competition will reduce liquidity creation by impeding relationship lending. This
view begins by noting that competition can make it easier for firms to change banks, making
it harder for banks to recoup the costs of building long-run relationships with firms (Petersen
and Rajan, 1995; Black and Strahan, 2002; Cetorelli and Strahan, 2006). Furthermore,
research finds that long-run bank-firms relationships can facilitate banks’ acquisition of “soft”
information about firms, including the liquidation value of firm assets (Berger et al., 2005;
Berger and Udell, 1995; Diamond and Rajan, 2001). As a result, “relationship lenders” are in
a position to create liquidity more effectively than other lenders. Under these conditions,
competition can impede effective liquidity creation by reducing relationship lending.
Theory also suggests mechanisms through which competition can boost liquidity
creation. First, competition tends to spur financial innovation and improve efficiency (Boot
and Thakor, 2000; Black and Strahan, 2002; Laeven, Levine, and Michalopoulos, 2015). One
dimension along which the bank might innovate is liquidity creation. Second, competition
tends to make banks more transparent (Jiang, Levine and Lin, 2016), which can spur bank
managers to devote more effort to screening potential borrowers and monitoring firms. In turn,
improvements in credit allocation can encourage more bank lending and more liquidity
creation. Thus theory provides differing views on the effect of competition on liquidity
creation.
To assess the impact of competition on liquidity creation, we follow a two-step method
for constructing time-varying measures of the competitive pressures facing each bank. First,
as in Goetz, Laeven, and Levine (2013), we exploit the process of interstate bank deregulation
that lowered barriers to competition between banks in different states. From the late-1970s

3

through 1995, states removed regulatory barriers to banks from other states entering their
borders. States removed restrictions in a dynamic, state-specific process either by unilaterally
opening their state borders and allowing out-of-state banks to enter or by signing reciprocal
bilateral and multilateral agreements with other states. States started interstate bank
deregulation in different years and followed different paths of deregulation as they signed
agreements with different states in different years. The process ended with the passage of the
Riegle-Neal Act of 1994, which effectively eliminated restrictions on interstate banking.
Second, we integrate this dynamic process of interstate bank deregulation with the
“gravity model” of investment, as in Jiang, Levine, and Lin (2016). For any state j, the
process of interstate bank deregulation provides time-varying information on the ability of
banks from other states to enter and compete in state j. The gravity model differentiates
among banks within state j. It predicts that the costs to banks in state k of establishing a
subsidiary somewhere in state j are positively related to geographic distance. Thus, the
integration of interstate bank deregulation and the gravity model predicts that when state j
allows banks from state k to enter, this will intensify competition more among banks in state j
that are closer to state k than among banks in state j that are farther away from k.
Operationally, for each bank i in each period, we (1) identify those states whose banks can
enter bank i’s state, and (2) weight each of those states by the inverse of its distance to bank i.
This yields an inverse-distance measure of the regulatory-induced competitive environment
facing each bank i in each period. We create two additional competition measures by further
weighting by either the economic size of or the number of banks in each “foreign” state. Thus,
by integrating the dynamic process of interstate bank deregulation with the predictions of the
gravity model, we construct three time-varying, bank-specific measures of competition.
To measure liquidity creation, we use the four Berger and Bouwman (2009) measures of
liquidity creations and extend them to cover our sample period. For the two category-based
measures, each on- and off-balance sheet bank item was categorized as either liquid,
semiliquid, or illiquid. For example, liquid items include short-term deposits, trading assets,
securitizable loans, and commercial paper, while illiquid items include business loans, loan
commitments, and letters of credit. Then, a weight of 0.5 was assigned to illiquid assets,

4

liquid liabilities, and illiquid off-balance sheet items and a weight of -0.5 was assigned to
liquid assets, illiquid liabilities, and liquid off-balance sheet items. A weight of 0 was assigned
to all semiliquid items. A bank’s category-based liquidity creation measure was constructed as
the value-weighted sum of those items. Following Berger and Bouwman (2009), we also use a
category-based measure that excludes off-balance sheet items. For the two maturity-based
measures of liquidity creation, the on- and off-balance sheets items were categorized as liquid
or illiquid based on whether they mature in less than or more than one year and then follow
the same weighting schedule for the category-based measures. Given data availability, we
conduct the analyses over the period from 1984 through 2006 using annual data.
We use a difference-in-differences estimation strategy to identify the impact of
competition on liquidity creation. The dependent variable is one of the liquidity creation
measures, which is measured at the bank-year level. The key independent variable is a
measure of the deregulation-induced competition pressures facing each bank in each year. We
include state-year fixed effects to control for all time-varying state characteristics. We include
bank fixed effects to control for all time invariant bank traits. Furthermore, we show that the
results are robust to controlling for various time-varying bank-specific characteristics. In
addition, a large body of existing research, as well as validity tests reported below, supports
our estimation strategy. For example, research finds that interstate bank deregulation does not
reflect bank performance (Jayaratne and Strahan, 1998; Goetz, Laeven, and Levine, 2013) or
state economic performance (Jayaratne and Strahan, 1996; Beck, Levine, and Levkov, 2010).
Moreover, we find that liquidity creation by banks in a state does not predict the timing of
interstate bank deregulation and discover no evidence that differential pre-trends in liquidity
creation across different states or banks account for the results.
We find that an intensification of competition in the banking industry materially reduces
liquidity creation. This holds for each of the four measures of liquidity creation and for each
of the three different measures of the deregulation-induced competitive pressures facing
individual banks. The estimates indicate that the impact is economically large. For example,
we find that a one-standard-deviation increase in the competitive pressures facing a bank is
associated with a 3.5 percentage point reduction in liquidity creation, which is large

5

considering that the sample average level of liquidity creation is 20 percent of total assets.
When applying this estimate to the average (median) bank in our sample, which has gross
total assets of $104 million ($627 million), the 3.5 percentage point reduction in the ratio of
liquidity creation to assets implies a loss of $3.6 million ($21.9 million) in liquidity creation
by the average (median) bank. Although existing work advertises the beneficial effects of
interstate bank deregulation and the corresponding intensification of competition, our research
indicates that this process of deregulation reduced liquidity creation. We also explore the
relation between the regulatory reform measures and the three components of the
category-based liquidity creation measure: asset-side, liability-side, and off-balance sheet
liquidity creation. We find that a drop in asset-side liquidity creation accounts for a large
proportion of the negative effect of competition on liquidity creation.
We next push the analyses beyond our core question of assessing the net effect of
competition on liquidity creation and explore two potential mechanisms through which
competition can reduce liquidity creation. Specifically, one view is that by squeezing profit
margins, competition reduces the willingness of banks to absorb more risk through liquidity
creation and hence reduces liquidity creation. If competition affects liquidity creation through
this profitability channel, then the negative impact of competition on liquidity creation should
be smaller among more profitable banks that have a large risk-absorbing buffer that can better
hedge liquidity risk. To test whether the data are consistent with this profitability channel, we
examine whether the negative impact of competition on liquidity provision is smaller among
more profitable banks. A second view is that by reducing the incentives of banks to establish
long-term relationship with their customers, an intensification of competition impedes
liquidity creation. If competition reduces liquidity creation through this relationship-lending
channel, the negative effect of competition on liquidity creation should be stronger among
banks that engage more intensively in relationship lending. To test this conjecture, we use
small sized banks to proxy for relationship lenders.
We find evidence consistent with the view that a regulatory-induced intensification of
competition reduces bank liquidity creation both by squeezing profit margins and by
impeding relationship lending. Specifically, we find that more profitable banks, as measured

6

by net interest margins, experience a smaller reduction in liquidity creation in response to
interstate bank deregulation. Similarly, we find that an intensification of competition reduces
liquidity creation more among small banks. Taken together, this evidence on profitability and
size are consistent with two views on how competition affects liquidity creation.
Our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains data and econometric methodology.
Section 3 presents and discusses the empirical results. Section 4 concludes.

2. DATA AND METHODOLOGY
This section first discusses the data sources and sample of banks that we use to evaluate the
impact of an intensification of competition on liquidity creation by banks. Second, we
describe the construction of the key variables. Finally, we discuss our econometric strategy
and provide tests of the validity of this strategy.

2.1 Data sources and sample of banks
We start with the population of commercial banks in the United States from 1984
through 2006. For each bank, the annual call report data are obtained from the Federal
Reserve Bank of Chicago, which provides Condition and Income statements for all
commercial banks regulated by the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, and the Comptroller of Currency. We exclude a bank if it has no deposits, has
zero or negative equity capital in the current or lagged year, has no commercial real estate or
commercial and industrial loans outstanding, or has unused commitments exceeding four
times its gross total assets. We also exclude banks that resemble thrifts, are classified by the
Federal Reserve as credit card banks, or have consumer loans over 50% of gross total assets.
We further exclude banks with average gross total assets below $25 million. Finally, we
follow the literature and drop Delaware and South Dakota because they have special laws to
encourage credit card banking. Our final sample contains 192,564 bank-year observations,
from 15,081 banks during the period from 1984 to 2006.

2.2 Liquidity creation

7

We use the four Berger and Bouwman (2009) measures of liquidity creation. To
construct their two category-based measures, they first classify each on- and off-balance sheet
bank item as either liquid, semiliquid, or illiquid. Appendix Table 1 details how Berger and
Bouwman (2009) define each on and off balance sheet item as liquid, semiliquid, and illiquid.
Second, they assign a weight to each category. Specifically, a weight of 0.5 is assigned to
illiquid assets, liquid liabilities, and illiquid off-balance sheet items; a weight of -0.5 is
assigned to liquid assets, illiquid liabilities, and liquid off-balance sheet items; and a weight of
0 is assigned to all semiliquid items. These weights assume that $1 of liquidity is created
(destroyed) when banks transform $1 of illiquid (liquid) assets or off-balance sheet items into
$1 of liquid (illiquid) liabilities. Finally, they compute a bank’s category-based liquidity
creation measure, Liquidity Creation (Category Based), as the weighted sum of the following
items:
Liquidity Creation (Category Based) = Asset-side Liquidity Creation +
Liability-side Liquidity Creation +
Off-balance Sheet Liquidity Creation,
where

(1)

Asset-side Liquidity Creation = [0.5*Illiquid Assets + 0*Semiliquid Assets
– 0.5*Liquid Assets]/Gross Total Assets,
Liability-side Liquidity Creation=[0.5*Liquid Liabilities + 0*Semiliquid Liabilities
– 0.5 * Illiquid Liabilities]/Gross Total Assets,
Off-balance Sheet Liquidity Creation=[0.5*Illiquid off-balance Sheet Items +
0*Semiliquid Off-balance Sheet Items –
0.5*Liquid Off-balance Sheet Items]/Gross Total
Assets,

where the bank-specific measures of on- and off-balance sheet subcomponents, such as
illiquid assets, semiliquid assets, liquid liabilities, etc., are computed as dollar values.
Furthermore, to make the measures comparable across banks, we normalize by the bank’s
gross total assets, which equals the sum of total assets, allowances for loan and lease losses,
and the allocated transfer risk reserve (a reserve for certain foreign loans).
Besides Liquidity Creation (Category Based), we use three additional liquidity creation
measures from Berger and Bouwman (2009). First, we include only on-balance sheet items

8

and call this measure, Liquidity Creation (Category Based, excluding Off-balance Sheet).
Second, we use two maturity-based measures of liquidity creation. The maturity-based
measures classify on- and off-balance sheet items as illiquid or liquid by whether they mature
in more or less than one year. Then, based on these maturity categories, we use the same
process as above. That is, we (1) assign a weight of 0.5 to illiquid assets, liquid liabilities, and
illiquid off-balance sheet items and a weight of -0.5 to liquid assets, illiquid liabilities, and
liquid off-balance sheet items and (2) compute the two value weighted maturity-based
measures:

Liquidity Creation (Maturity Based) and Liquidity Creation (Maturity Based,

excluding Off-balance Sheet). We winsorize the four liquidity creation ratios at the 1% and 99%
levels. Appendix Table 1 provides more details on these liquidity creation measures.
We follow Berger and Bouwman (2009) and focus on the Liquidity Creation (Category
Based) for two main reasons. First, the liquidity of loans depends more on how easily and
inexpensively they can be securitized or sold rather than how soon the loans mature. Second,
off-balance sheet activities contribute materially to overall liquidity creation. As shown in
Table 1, roughly 20 percent of the total liquidity creation in our sample comes from
off-balance sheet items. As shown below, the results hold across the four liquidity creation
measures.

2.3 Measuring competition using interstate deregulation
To measure exogenous changes in the competitive pressures facing each individual bank,
we exploit the removal of regulatory impediments to interstate banking during the last quarter
of the 20th century. By lowering regulatory barriers to banks headquartered in one state
establishing subsidiaries in another state, interstate bank deregulation increased the
contestability of banking markets, intensifying competition among banks. As a result of this
competition, interstate bank deregulation reduced interest rates on loans and increased interest
rates on deposits (Jayaratne and Strahan, 1998).
From the late-1970s through 1995, states engaged in a process of interstate bank
deregulation, in which a state allowed banks from other states to acquire or establish
subsidiary banks within its borders. States removed restrictions in a dynamic, state-specific

9

process either by unilaterally opening their state borders and allowing out-of-state banks to
enter or by signing reciprocal bilateral and multilateral agreements with other states. States
both started interstate bank deregulation in different years and followed different paths of
deregulation as they signed agreements with different states in different years. The process of
interstate bank deregulation ended with the passage of the Riegle-Neal Act of 1994, which
effectively eliminated restrictions on interstate banking across the United States.
Following Jiang, Levine, and Lin (2016), we integrate the dynamic, state-specific process
of interstate bank deregulation with the “gravity model” of investment to construct a
time-varying measure of the competitive pressures facing each bank. In particular, for any
state j, the interstate bank deregulation provides a state-time indicator of the ability of banks
from other states to enter and compete in state j. The gravity model differentiates among
banks with state j. It predicts that the costs to a bank in state k of establishing a subsidiary in
state j are positively related to the distance between states j and k. Thus, the integration of
interstate bank deregulation and the gravity model predicts that when state j allows banks
from state k to enter, this will intensify competition more among banks in state j that are
closer to state k than among banks in state j that are farther away from k. By integrating the
dynamic process of interstate bank deregulation with the predictions of the gravity model, we
construct time-varying, bank-specific measures of competition.
More specifically, we measure a bank’s time-varying exposure to interstate deregulation
in two steps. First, for each bank i located in home state j in year t, we identify all of the states
(k’s) whose banks are allowed to enter bank i’s home state j in that year and compute the
inverse of the distance between bank i and state k’s capital city (i. e. , 1/𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 ). 1 Second,
for each bank i in each year t, we calculate the summation of the inverse distance to states

whose banks are allowed to enter bank i’s home state j, and then take the natural logarithm of
this summation. This yields a measure of the competitive pressures facing each bank in each
year. To put it formally, we calculate the following:
1

Specifically, we measure distance from bank i’s county to the county of state k’s capital city. The county
distance database is provided at: http://www.nber.org/data/ county-distance-database.html. As a robustness
check, we examine the distance from bank i to the city in state k with the largest number of banks. As shown in
Appendix Table 4, the results hold.

𝑂𝑗𝑗𝑗
𝑖 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖

(2)

where 𝑂𝑗𝑗𝑗 equals one if banks from state k are allowed to enter state j in period t and zero
otherwise. 2

Furthermore, besides this basic measure (Bank Competition (Distance Weighted)), we
create and examine two additional time-varying, bank-specific measures of competition. One
measure weights the summation of inverse of distance by the number of banks in state k
(Bank Competition (Distance and # of Banks Weighted)), while the other weights by the
economic size of state k (Bank Competition (Distance and GSP Weighted)). More specifically,
we compute the following:
𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑎𝑎𝑎 # 𝑜𝑜 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑡)𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝐿𝐿 �

(4)

where 𝐾𝑘𝑘 represents the total number of banks in state k in period t, and 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑘𝑘 represents

gross state product of state k in period t.

2.4 Other control variables
To control for other factors that might be related to bank competition and liquidity
creation, our regressions include a set of time-varying bank characteristics including the
logarithm of bank size (logSIZE), Capital Asset Ratio measured as the book value of equity
over total assets, and a dummy variable indicating whether a bank belongs to a multibank
holding company (Multibank Holding Company). Table 1 provides summary statistics of the
variables used in our analyses. The definitions of variables are presented in Appendix Table 1.
The median commercial bank in our sample has gross total assets of $104 million (in 2014
dollars), while the average bank has assets of $627 million. Given the skewness in bank size,

2

We set a value of 0.000001 to those cases where 𝐿𝐿 ∑𝑖

𝑂𝑗𝑗𝑗

𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖

= 0.

11

we use the natural logarithm of bank size. The average Capital Asset Ratio is 0.09, and about
30% of the commercial banks belong to multi-bank holding companies.

2.5 Econometric Strategy
To evaluate the impact of bank competition on liquidity creation, we use a
difference-in-differences (DID) methodology. Since the unit of analysis is at the
bank-state-year level, we control for both state-time and bank fixed effects. The state-time
fixed effects capture all time-varying state influences. Bank fixed effects capture all
time-invariant bank characteristics.
We use the following ordinary least squares (OLS) regression specification:
𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽 ∙ 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾 ′ 𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝑖 + 𝛿𝑗𝑗 + 𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

(5)

where 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖 is one of the measures of liquidity creation for bank i in state j

in year t, 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖 is one of the measures of the competitive pressures facing

bank i in state j in year t, 𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector of time-varying bank-specific characteristics

(logSIZE, Capital Asset Ratio, and Multibank Holding Company), and 𝛿𝑖 and 𝛿𝑗𝑗 are bank

and state-year fixed effects respectively. In seeking to assess the impact of an intensification
of competition on liquidity creation, we focus on estimating β. Since including endogenous
bank-specific characteristics could interfere with drawing sharp inferences about β, we
provide estimates both with and without the 𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖 control variables. We discuss and present a

series of robustness tests below. Throughout the analyses, we report standard errors that are
heteroskedasticity-consistent and two-way clustered at the state and year level. The results are

robust to clustering at either the state or state-year levels.

12

2.6 Validation test
One concern with our identification strategy is that liquidity creation influences a state’s
decisions on interstate bank deregulation. For example, the lack of bank lending within a state
may induce state officials to liberalize restrictions on interstate banking to boost lending. This
would confound our ability to identify the impact of competition on liquidity creation.
To assess this concern, we follow Kroszner and Strahan (1999). To their empirical model
of the timing of interstate bank deregulation, we include a measure of liquidity creation and
examine whether lagged values of liquidity creation predict the timing of interstate banking
reforms. Specifically, we calculate an aggregate index of liquidity created by banks within a
state by weighting each bank’s liquidity creation by its assets and test whether this index
predicts when a state first started to liberalize its interstate banking restrictions. We
experimented with different lags and report the results with lags of one to three years in Table
2. The dependent variable is the average across banks in a state-year of one of the three
competition measures (i.e. Bank Competition (Distance Weighted), Bank Competition
(Distance and # of Banks Weighted), and Bank Competition (Distance and GSP Weighted)).
Furthermore, we control for a set of state characteristics used in Kroszner and Strahan’s (1999)
exploration of the determinants of interstate bank deregulation. These controls include gross
state product per capita, state unemployment rate, the small firm share in the state, small bank
share in the state, capital ratio of small banks relative to large ones, relative size of insurance
in states where banks can sell insurance, relative size of insurance in states where banks
cannot sell insurance, an indicator for unit banking law, an indicator for one party control in
the state, and share of state government controlled by Democrats. In this way, we test whether
liquidity creation predicts regulatory induced changes in the competitive pressures facing
banks.
Table 2 shows that liquidity creation does not predict the timing of regulatory reforms.
Table 2 provides only the results for the main liquidity measure (Liquidity Creation (Category
Based)), while Appendix Table 2 shows that these results hold when examining the other three
liquidity creation measures. Consistent with our identification strategy, there is no indication
that liquidity creation predicts the timing of interstate deregulation.

13

3. EMPIRICAL RESULTS
This section presents results on the impact of a regulatory-induced intensification of
competition on liquidity creation. We first provide the baseline results using measures of
liquidity creation (the Category Based and Category Based, excluding Off-balance Sheet) and
show that all of these results hold when using the maturity-based measures of liquidity
creation. We then decompose and analyze the individual components of these
measures—asset-side on-balance sheet liquidity creation, liability-side on-balance sheet
liquidity creation, and off-balance sheet liquidity creation. We finish this section by
conducting an exploratory examination of the theoretical mechanisms underlying the link
between competition and liquidity creation.

3.1 The effect of bank competition on liquidity creation
Table 3 presents regression results based on equation (5), where the dependent variable is
one of the category-based measures of liquidity creation and the main explanatory variable is
one of the three time-varying, bank-specific measures of the competitive pressures facing
each bank. In Panel A, we only control for state-year and bank fixed effects. In Panel B, we
also control for bank-level controls (logSIZE, Capital Asset Ratio, and Multibank Holding
Company). In columns (1) –(3) of Panels A and B, the dependent variable is Liquidity
Creation (Category Based) and in columns (4) – (6) of both panels the dependent variable is
Liquidity Creation (Category Based, excluding Off-balance Sheet). Thus, Table 3 reports the
results of twelve regressions.
The results presented in Table 3 indicate that interstate bank deregulation reduced
liquidity creation by banks. Each of the three measures of regulatory-induced
competition—Bank Competition (Distance Weighted), Bank Competition (Distance Weighted
and # of Banks Weighted), and Bank Competition (Distance Weighted and GSP Weighted)
enters negatively and significantly at the one percent significance level. This holds across
both category-based measures of liquidity creation and when including or excluding the
bank-level controls.

14

The estimated coefficients indicate that the impact of bank deregulation on liquidity
creation is economically large. For example, consider the estimate from the regression in
which the dependent variable is Liquidity Creation (Category Based), the regulatory-induced
competition measure is Bank Competition (Distance Weighted), and the regression includes
bank-level controls (column 1 of Panel B of Table 3). The coefficient estimate on competition
(-0.0067) suggests that a one-standard-deviation increase (5.22) in Bank Competition
(Distance Weighted) is associated with a reduction in Liquidity Creation (Category Based) of
about 3.5 percentage points. This is a meaningful reduction, as the sample mean is 20 percent.
When applying this estimate to the average (median) bank in our sample, which has gross
total assets of $104 million ($627 million), the 3.5 percentage point reduction in the ratio of
liquidity creation to assets implies a loss of $3.6 million ($21.9 million) in liquidity creation
by the average (median) bank.
With respect to the bank-level control variables, the results in Panel B of Table 3 indicate
that banks with a higher Capital Asset Ratio tend to create less liquidity. This is in accordance
with the “financial fragility” view that additional bank capital makes the bank’s capital
structure less fragile so that banks are reluctant to commit to monitoring, which in turns
impedes the bank’s ability to create liquidity (Diamond and Rajan 2000, 2001). It is also
consistent with the prediction of the capital “crowd out” theory that a higher capital ratio may
reduce liquidity creation through crowding out deposits, since deposits are liquid and bank
equity is illiquid (Gorton and Winton 2014). We also find that liquidity creation is positively
related to Multibank Holding Company, suggesting that banks belonging to multiple BHCs
create more liquidity. This finding is consistent with the argument that banks within the same
BHC serve as an internal capital market to cross-provide liquidity in times of financial
distress (Berger and Bouwman 2009), including distress triggered by competition.
We confirm the finding that interstate bank deregulation reduced liquidity creation when
using the maturity-based measures of liquidity creation. As shown in Table 4, we confirm
all of the result in Table 3 using Liquidity Creation (Maturity Based) and Liquidity Creation
(Maturity Based, excluding Off-balance Sheet). The results in Table 4 are remarkably similar
to those reported in Table 3, both statistically and economically.

15

We next explore the relation between the regulatory reform measures and the three
components of Liquidity Creation (Category Based): asset-side, liability-side, and off-balance
sheet liquidity creation. Table 1 shows that the majority of bank liquidity creation (per unit of
asset) occurs through liability-side items. The means (standard deviations) of asset-side,
liability-side, and off-balance sheet liquidity creation ratio are -0.02 (0.14), 0.18 (0.06), and
0.04 (0.04), respectively. Table 5 reports the results of using the asset-side, liability-side, and
off-balance sheet liquidity creation measures as dependent variables in equation (5). For each
of the three dependent variables, we separately examine the three regulatory-induced
measures of competition. We report the results while including the bank-specific controls, but
the results are robust to excluding them.
Overall, the findings in Table 5 indicate that the negative effect of regulatory-induced
competition on liquidity creation is largely accounted for by the negative effect of competition
on asset-side liquidity creation. As shown, the interstate deregulation indicators induced a
large drop in asset-side liquidity creation, a small drop in off-balance sheet liquidity creation,
and an increase in liability-side liquidity creation. In terms of magnitudes, a
one-standard-deviation increase (5.22) in Bank Competition (Distance Weighted) (the first
row) induces a reduction in asset-side liquidity creation of 3.7 (=0.0070*5.22) percentage
points, an increase in liability-side liquid creation of 0.9 (=0.0018*5.22) percentage points,
and a decline in off-balance sheet liquidity creation of 0.7 (=0.0014 *5.22) percentage points.
Relative to their sample means, the effect of deregulation on asset-side liquidity creation is
larger than the other components, and the effect on liability-side liquidity creation is nearly
negligible.
We conclude this subsection by describing several additional robustness tests. First, since
many corporate policies might be determined at the BHC level, we redo the regressions using
data on BHCs, not on individual banks. The information on BHCs is obtained from the
consolidated balance sheets and income statements for holding companies that are provided
by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago since the 3rd quarter of 1986. We define a banking
institution as an ultimate BHC if it owns, but is not owned by, other banking institutions, with
at least 50% ownership of the subsidiaries’ equity stake (Goetz, Laeven, and Levine 2013;

16

Jiang, Levine, and Lin 2016). We are able to identify 834 BHCs headquartered in the U.S.
(excluding South Dakota and Delaware) between 1986 and 2006.
To construct BHC-level measures of liquidity creation, we aggregate the bank-level
liquidity creation measures to the BHC level by weighting each bank’s liquidity creation by
its proportion of assets within the BHC. Specifically, we take each bank i located in state j
within each BHC c headquartered in state w during period t and aggregate as follows:
𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐𝑐 = � 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,
𝑖∈𝑐

(6)

where 𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the proportion of assets of each bank i within BHC c in period t relative to the

total assets of BHC c, and state w and state j may or may not be the same.

We also compute the regulatory-induced competition measures at the BHC-level. We do
this by aggregating the bank-level competition measures to the BHC level. Specifically, we
first identify each bank i in state j that belongs to BHC c headquartered in state w in period t
and we then calculate BHC c’s distance weighted regulatory-induced competition measure as
follows:

𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑡)𝑐𝑐𝑐

(7)

= � 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑡)𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,
𝑖∈𝑐

We use the same method described in equation (7) to construct the other two BHC-specific
competition measures: BHC Competition (Distance and # of Banks Weighted) and BHC
Competition (Distance and GSP Weighted). Appendix Table 3 presents the BHC-level analysis
for both the category-based and maturity-based measures of liquidity creations. Consistent
with the bank-level results, BHC-level competition enters negatively and significantly across
all specifications.
The second sensitivity check examines an alternative measure of bank-specific
competition. Our previous measure of bank competition is based on the distance from a bank
to the county of a non-home state’s capital city. As a robustness check, use the distance from

17

the bank to the county of the city with the greatest number of banks in the non-home state.
Appendix Table 4 shows that all of the results hold.
Third, there might be concerns that the results are driven only by banks expanding
through mergers and acquisitions or by being purchased by other banks. Thus, we redid the
analyses while restricting the sample to only banks that are not part of any mergers or
acquisitions. They are still subject to changes in competitive pressures, as their markets
become more contestable due to bank deregulation. We find that all of the results hold, and
hold with similar parameters estimates, when restricting the sample to these banks.

3.2 An exploration of two possible mechanisms
So far we have found that bank competition—as measured by interstate bank
deregulation—reduces liquidity creation, but we have not explored the channels through
which competition shapes liquidity creation. Although the primary objective of this research is
simply to evaluate whether, on net, an intensification of competition among banks increases,
decreases, or has no effect on liquidity creation, we now provide an exploratory examination
of two potential channels: profitability and relationship lending.
One view is that by squeezing profit margins, competition reduces the willingness of
banks to absorb more risk through liquidity creation and hence reduces liquidity creation. If
competition affects liquidity creation through this channel, then the negative impact of
competition on liquidity creation should be smaller among more profitable banks that can
better absorb liquidity risk. Thus, we test this prediction.
To assess the profitability channel, we expand our baseline regression specification and
include the interaction between High Profit and the regulatory-induced competition measures.
To construct High Profit, we begin by calculating Profitability, which equals the net interest
margin, i.e., the ratio of net interest income to total assets. We then set High Profit equal to
one if in the initial sample period (1984-1986) Profitability is greater than the sample
median. 3 The profitability view predicts a positive relation between liquidity creation and the
3

All of the results hold if we instead set High Profit equal to one if a bank’s profitability is greater than the
sample median over the entire sample period and zero otherwise.

18

interaction between competition and profitability.
As shown in Table 6, the estimates are consistent with the profitability view, as the
estimated coefficients on the interaction between competition and profitability enter positively
and significantly in all specifications. We continue to find that the bank competition measures
enter negatively and significantly. If one interprets High Profit as positively associated with
the risk absorption capacity of banks, then our findings imply that competition reduces
liquidity creation less when banks have a greater capacity to absorb risk.
A second view is that competition reduces liquidity creation by impeding relationship
lending. This implies that the negative impact of competition on liquidity creation should be
stronger among banks that rely more heavily on relationship lending. Based on Petersen and
Rajan (1994), we use bank size to proxy for the bank’s reliance on relationship lending given
the absence of data tracking banks’ lending records with customers. Petersen and Rajan (1994)
document that relationship lending is more valuable to small firms. Thus, to proxy for
relationship lenders, we use Small Size, which equals one if a bank’s gross total assets are
smaller than the sample median during the entire sample period, and zero otherwise. We
include this proxy along with its interaction with the regulatory-induced competition measures.
If this interaction term enters with a negative coefficient, it would suggest that in response to
an intensification of competition, liquidity creation falls more among relationship lenders.
The estimates reported in Table 7 are consistent with the relationship lending effect. First,
consistent with the earlier results, the regulatory-induced measures of competition enter
negatively and significantly, confirming that interstate bank deregulation reduces liquidity
creation. Second, the interaction term of interstate bank deregulation and Small Size enters
negatively and significantly (except for columns 4-6). This implies that regulatory-induced
competition exerts a more pronounced negative effect on liquidity creation in small banks that
are major relationship lenders.

19

4. CONCLUSION
Although it is widely recognized that liquidity creation is one of the major services
provided by bank to the economy, there are only a few studies of the factors shaping bank
liquidity creation and no previous studies of the impact of competition on liquidity creation.
In this paper, we evaluate the impact of an intensification of competition among banks on
liquidity creation. To do this, we employ a novel approach to measuring the time-varying
competitive pressures facing each commercial bank in the United States over the period from
1984 through 2006.
The results are consistent with the view that an intensification of competition reduces
liquidity creation. This finding of a “liquidity-destroying” effect of competition is robust to
using different measures of liquidity creation, different measures of bank competition, the
inclusion or exclusion of time-varying bank characteristics, and controlling for state-year and
bank fixed effects. While research has identified many positive effects from competition, this
paper suggests some trade-offs with respect to liquidity creation.

Table 2. Validity Test - Banking Deregulations and Lagged Liquidity Creations
This table presents OLS regressions of bank regulatory reforms on lagged values of category based liquidity
creation and other potential predictors of regulatory reforms. The sample consists of state-year observations
from 1984 to 2006 and excludes states that deregulated in or before 1984. Definitions for the dependent
variable bank competition measures are presented in Appendix Table 1. The variable State Weighted Liquidity
Creation (Category Based) is calculated by the bank level liquidity creation measure Liquidity Creation
(Category Based) aggregated to the state level and weighted by the proportion of the commercial bank’s total
assets held by its subsidiaries and branches in that state. Detained definition and classification of liquidity
creation measures can be found in Appendix Table 1. Following Kroszner and Strahan (1999), the following
control variables are included: GSP per capita, state level unemployment rate, small bank share of all banking
assets, and capital ratio of small banks relative to large ones, relative size of insurance in states where banks
may sell insurance (zero otherwise), relative size of insurance in states where banks may not sell insurance
(zero otherwise), an indicator variable that equal to one if banks may sell insurance (zero otherwise), small
firm (fewer than 20 employees) share of the number of firms in the state, unit banking law, share of state
government controlled by Democrats, and an indicator that takes a value of one if the state is controlled by one
party. We also include state dummy variables. Standard errors are adjusted for state-level clustering and appear
in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significant at 1%, 5%, and 10%.

Table 4. Competition and Maturity Based Liquidity Creation
Panel A. Without Any Bank Level Controls
This table presents results of the effects of banking deregulations on maturity-based liquidity creation of
commercial banks, without including any bank level control variables in the regressions. The sample consists
of bank-year observations from 1984 through 2006. The dependent variables in columns 1-3 and 4-6 are
Liquidity Creation (Maturity Based) and Liquidity Creation (Maturity Based, excluding Off-balance Sheet),

Table 4. Competition and Maturity Based Liquidity Creation
Panel B. With Bank Level Controls
This table presents results of the effects of banking deregulations on maturity based liquidity creation of
commercial banks. The sample consists of bank-quarter observations from 1984 through 2006. The dependent
variables in columns 1-3 and 4-6 are Liquidity Creation (Maturity Based) and Liquidity Creation (Maturity
Based, excluding Off-balance Sheet), respectively. Detailed definition and classification for the liquidity
creation measures can be found in Appendix Table 1. The control variable logSIZE is defined as the natural
logarithm of gross total assets in thousand real 2014 U.S. dollars. Capital Asset Ratio is the ratio of book value
of equity over total assets. Both logSIZE and Capital Asset Ratio are lagged one year prior to the
observation of the dependent variable. Multibank Holding Company is an indicator variable that equals one
if a bank has been part of a multibank holding company in the past three years, and zero if otherwise. Standard
errors are heteroskedasticity-consistent, two-way clustered at the state and year level, and reported in
parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significant at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

Table 5. Decomposition of Category Based Liquidity Creation
This table presents results of the effects of banking deregulations on asset-side, liability-side, and off-balance sheet category based liquidity creation of commercial banks.
The sample consists of bank-year observations from 1984 through 2006. The dependent variables in columns 1-3, 4-6, and 7-9 are Asset-side Liquidity Creation,
Liability-side Liquidity Creation, and Off-balance Sheet Liquidity Creation, respectively, where Asset-side Liquidity Creation + Liability-side Liquidity Creation +
Off-balance Sheet Liquidity Creation= Liquidity Creation (Category Based). Detailed definition and classification for the liquidity creation measures can be found in
Appendix Table 1. The control variable logSIZE is defined as the natural logarithm of gross total assets in thousand real 2014 U.S. dollars. Capital Asset Ratio is the ratio
of book value of equity over total assets. Both logSIZE and Capital Asset Ratio are lagged one year prior to the observation of the dependent variable. Multibank
Holding Company is an indicator variable that equals one if a bank has been part of a multibank holding company in the past three years, and zero if otherwise. Standard
errors are heteroskedasticity-consistent, two-way clustered at the state and year level, and reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significant at 10%, 5%, and 1%,

Table 6. Profitability Effect
This table presents results of profitability effects of banking deregulations on liquidity creation. The sample consists of bank-year observations from 1984 through 2006. The
dependent variables in columns 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12 are Liquidity Creation (Category Based), Liquidity Creation (Category Based, excluding Off-balance Sheet), Liquidity
Creation (Maturity Based), and Liquidity Creation (Maturity Based, excluding Off-balance Sheet), respectively. Profitability is defined as net interest income over total assets, and

lagged one year prior to the observation of the dependent variable. High Profit is defined as a dummy that equal to one if in the initial period (1984-1986) a bank’s
median profitability is greater than the sample median profitability and zero otherwise. Other firm controls include logSIZE, Capital Asset Ratio, and Multibank

Holding Company. Detailed definition for all the variables are presented in Appendix Table 1. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity-consistent, two-way clustered at the state and

Liquidity Creation Measures
Liquidity Creation (Category

Liquidity Creation (Category

Liquidity Creation (Maturity
Based)

Liquidity Creation (Maturity
Based, excluding Off-balance
Sheet)

The construction of this measure follows a three-step procedure: First, all bank
balance sheet and off-balance sheet activities are classified as liquid,
semiliquid, or illiquid. Second, assign a weight of½ to both illiquid assets and
liquid liabilities and guarantees, and a weight of −½ to both liquid assets,
equity, liquid guarantees and derivatives and illiquid liabilities. For the
semiliquid assets, liabilities, and guarantees, an intermediate weight of 0 is
assigned. Third, combine the activities as classified in the first step and as
weighted in the second step to construct the liquidity creation measures.
Detailed classification of liquid/illiquid assets/liabilities and equity/off-balance
sheet activities can be found in definitions for asset-side, liability-side and
off-balance sheet liquidity creations. Liquidity Creation (Category Based) is
scaled by gross total assets, which equals total assets plus the allowance for
loan and lease losses and the allocated transfer risk reserve (a reserve for
certain foreign loans).

maturity instead of category. Details of loan classification can be found in
definitions for asset-side, liability-side and off-balance sheet liquidity
creations. Liquidity Creation (Maturity Based) is scaled by gross total assets,
which equals total assets plus the allowance for loan and lease losses and the
allocated transfer risk reserve (a reserve for certain foreign loans).

Asset-side Liquidity Creation

= Illiquid Assets – Liquid Assets, where “Liquid Assets” include cash
and due from other institutions, all securities regardless of maturity,
trading assets, and federal funds sold, and “Illiquid Assets” include the
following depending on different liquidity creation measures:
(Category Based Liquidity Creations) commercial real estate loans,
loans to finance agricultural production, commercial and industrial
loans, other loans and lease financing receivables.
(Maturity Based Liquidity Creations) all loans and leases with a
remaining maturity longer than one year.
(For both Category and Maturity Based Liquidity Creations) other real
estate owned, customers’ liability on banker’s acceptances, investment
in unconsolidated subsidiaries, intangible assets, premises, and other
assets.

Liability-side Liquidity
Creation

=Liquid Liabilities – Illiquid Liabilities, where “Illiquid Liabilities”
include: transactions deposits, savings deposits, overnight federal funds
purchased, and trading liabilities; and “Liquid Liabilities” include: bank’s
liability on bankers acceptances, subordinated debt, other liabilities, and
equity.

Off-balance Sheet Liquidity
Creation

=Illiquid Items – Liquid Items, where “Illiquid Items” include unused
commitments, net standby letters of credit, commercial and similar
letters of credit, and all other off-balance sheet liabilities; and “Liquid
Items” include net participations acquired, interest rate derivatives,
foreign exchange derivatives, and equity and commodity derivatives.

Competition Measures
Bank Competition (Distance
Weighted)

We calculate the interstate bank competitive pressure facing each commercial
bank i, located in state j in period t as the summation of the inverse distance
between bank i and each of the other state k that is allowed to enter in state j in
period t. We take the natural logarithm of the sum of the weighted distance
measures. The distance is measured from each commercial bank to the capital
of every other state using the great-circle distances based on internal pointes in
the geographic area from the commercial bank’s county to the capital city
county. The county distance database is downloaded and matched from the
NBER database: http://www.nber.org/data/county-distance-database.html.

Bank Competition (Distance
and # of Banks Weighted)

We calculate the interstate bank competitive pressure facing each commercial
bank i, located in state j in period t as the summation of the inverse distance
between bank i and each of the other state k that is allowed to enter in state j in
period t. We further weight this regulatory environment index by the number of
banks in the other state. We take the natural logarithm of the sum of the
weighted distance measures. The distance is measured from each commercial
bank to the capital of every other state using the great-circle distances based on
internal pointes in the geographic area from the commercial bank's county to
the capital city county. The county distance database is downloaded and
matched from the NBER database:
http://www.nber.org/data/county-distance-database.html.

35

Bank Competition (Distance
and GSP Weighted)

We calculate the interstate bank competitive pressure facing each commercial
bank i, located in state j in period t as the summation of the inverse distance
between bank i and each of the other state k that is allowed to enter in state j in
period t. We further weight this regulatory environment index by the economic
size (GSP per capita in $10,000) of the other state. We take the natural
logarithm of the sum of the weighted distance measures. The distance is
measured from each commercial bank to the capital of every other state using
the great-circle distances based on internal pointes in the geographic area from
the commercial bank’s county to the capital city county. The county distance
database is downloaded and matched from the NBER database:
http://www.nber.org/data/county-distance-database.html.

Bank Competition Alternative
(Distance Weighted)

We calculate the interstate bank competitive pressure facing each commercial
bank i, located in state j in period t as the summation of the inverse distance
between bank i and each of the other state k that is allowed to enter in state j in
period t. We take the natural logarithm of the sum of the weighted distance
measures. The distance is measured from each commercial bank to the city
with most banks of every other state using the great-circle distances based on
internal pointes in the geographic area from the commercial bank’s county to
that city’s county. The county distance database is downloaded and matched
from the NBER database:
http://www.nber.org/data/county-distance-database.html.

Bank Competition Alternative
(Distance and # of Banks
Weighted)

We calculate the interstate bank competitive pressure facing each commercial
bank i, located in state j in period t as the summation of the inverse distance
between bank i and each of the other state k that is allowed to enter in state j in
period t. We further weight this regulatory environment index by the number of
banks in the other state. We take the natural logarithm of the sum of the
weighted distance measures. The distance is measured from each commercial
bank to the city with most banks of every other state using the great-circle
distances based on internal pointes in the geographic area from the commercial
bank's county to that city county. The county distance database is downloaded
and matched from the NBER database:
http://www.nber.org/data/county-distance-database.html.

Bank Competition Alternative
(Distance and GSP Weighted)

We calculate the competitive pressure facing each commercial bank i, located
in state j in period t as the summation of the inverse distance between bank i
and each of the other states that is allowed to enter state j in period t. We
further weight this regulatory environment index by the economic size (GSP
per capita in $10,000) of the other state. We take the natural logarithm of the
sum of the weighted distance measures. The distance is measured from each
commercial bank to the city with most banks of every other state using the
great-circle distances based on internal pointes in the geographic area from the

Control Variables
logSIZE

The natural logarithm of gross total assets in ‘000 $ in year t-1, where gross
total assets equals total assets plus the allowance for loan and lease losses and
the allocated transfer risk reserve (a reserve for certain foreign loans). Amounts
are adjusted in real 2014 dollars using the implicit GDP price deflator.

Capital Asset Ratio

Ratio of book value of equity over total assets in year t-1.

Multibank Holding Company

Dummy =1 if a bank has been part of a multibank holding company in the any
of the past three years, =0 if otherwise.

Profitability

Ratio of net interest income over total assets in year t-1.

High Profit

An indicator that equal to one if in the initial period (1984-1986) a
bank’s median profitability is greater than the sample median
profitability and zero otherwise.

Small Size

An indicator that equals one if a bank’s gross total assets are smaller than the
sample median value over the entire sample period and zero otherwise.

Appendix Table 2. Validity Test - Banking Deregulations and Lagged Liquidity Creations:
Using Other Liquidity Creation Measures
This table presents OLS regressions of bank regulatory reforms on lagged values of category based (excluding
off-balance sheet) or maturity based liquidity creations and other potential predictors of regulatory reforms. The
sample consists of state-year observations from 1984 to 2006 and excludes states that deregulated in or before
1984. Definitions for the dependent variable bank competition measures are presented in Appendix Table 1. The
key explanatory variables in Panel A, B, and C, are State Weighted Liquidity Creation (Category Based,
excluding Off-balance Sheet), State Weighted Liquidity Creation (Maturity Based), and State Weighted Liquidity
Creation (Maturity Based, excluding Off-balance Sheet), respectively. The State Weighted Liquidity Creation
variables are calculated by the corresponding bank level liquidity creation measures aggregated to the state level
and weighted by the proportion of the commercial bank’s total assets held by its subsidiaries and branches in
that state. Detained definition and classification of liquidity creation measures can be found in Appendix Table 1.
Following Kroszner and Strahan (1999), the following control variables are included: GSP per capita, state level
unemployment rate, small bank share of all banking assets, and capital ratio of small banks relative to large ones,
relative size of insurance in states where banks may sell insurance (zero otherwise), relative size of insurance in
states where banks may not sell insurance (zero otherwise), an indicator variable that equal to one if banks may
sell insurance (zero otherwise), small firm (fewer than 20 employees) share of the number of firms in the state,
unit banking law, share of state government controlled by Democrats, and an indicator that takes a value of one
if the state is controlled by one party. We also include state dummy variables. Standard errors are adjusted for
state-level clustering and appear in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significant at 1%, 5%, and 10%.

Appendix Table 3. Competition and Liquidity Creation – BHC Level Analysis
Panel A. Dependent Variables: Category Based Liquidity Creations
This table presents results of the effects of banking deregulations on category based liquidity creation of bank
holding companies (BHCs). The sample consists of BHC-year observations from the 3rd quarter of 1986 through
2006. The sample consists of bank-year observations from 1986 through 2006. The dependent variables in
columns 1-3 and 4-6 are Liquidity Creation (Category Based) and Liquidity Creation (Category Based, excluding
Off-balance Sheet), respectively. These measures are calculated based on asset-weighted liquidity creation of
commercial banks that belong to the BHC. Detailed definition and classification for the liquidity creation
measures can be found in Appendix Table 1. BHC Competition (Distance Weighted), BHC Competition (Distance
and # of Banks Weighted), and BHC Competition (Distance and GSP Weighted) are asset-weighted regulatory
environment (Bank Competition (Distance Weighted), Bank Competition (Distance and # of Banks Weighted),
Bank Competition (Distance and GSP Weighted)) facing each subsidiary (including the subsidiaries in the state of
the BHC’s headquarters) across all subsidiaries owned by the BHC. Other bank controls include logSIZE,
Capital Asset Ratio, and Multibank Holding Company, where Multibank Holding Company is a dummy variable
that equals one if a BHC is a multibank holding company, and zero otherwise. Definitions for all the other
variables can be found in Appendix Table 1. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity-consistent, two-way clustered
at the state and year level, and reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significant at 10%, 5%, and 1%,
respectively.
