Aging and Pension Reform: Extending the Retirement Age and Human Capital Formation

NBER Working Paper No. 18856
February 2013
JEL No. C68,E17,E25,J11,J24
ABSTRACT
Projected demographic changes in industrialized and developing countries vary in extent and timing
but will reduce the share of the population in working age everywhere. Conventional wisdom suggests
that this will increase capital intensity with falling rates of return to capital and increasing wages. This
decreases welfare for middle aged agents with assets accumulated for retirement. This paper addresses
three important adjustments channels to dampen these detrimental effects of ageing: investing abroad,
endogenous human capital formation and increasing the retirement age. Although non of these suggestions
is new in itself, we examine their effects jointly in one coherent model. Our quantitative finding is
that openness has a relatively mild effect. In contrast, endogenous human capital formation in combination
with an increase in the retirement age has strong effects. Under these adjustments maximum welfare
losses of demographic change for households alive in 2010 are reduced by about 3 percentage points.

1 Introduction
The world will experience major changes in its demographic structure in the next decades. In
all countries, this process is driven by increasing life expectancy and falling birth rates. The
fraction of the population in working-age will decrease and the fraction of people in old-age
will increase. This process is already well under way in industrialized countries with many
developing countries following suit in a few decades. Standard economic analyses predict that
these demographic processes will increase the capital-labor ratio. Hence, rates of return to
capital will decrease and wages increase, which has adverse welfare consequences for current
cohorts who will be retired when the rate of return on assets is low.
The purpose of this paper is to ask how strongly three channels of adjustment to these ongoing developments and their interactions dampen such adverse welfare effects. First, compared to industrialized countries, developing countries are relatively young. In autarky, rates
of return to capital in these economies are therefore higher. From the perspective of industrialized countries, globalization and investing capital abroad may therefore stabilize the return
to capital. Second, as raw labor will become a relatively scarce factor and as life expectancy
increases, strong incentives to invest in human capital emanate. This improves productivity.
Such endogenous human capital adjustments may thereby substantially mitigate the effects of
demographic change on macroeconomic aggregates and individual welfare. Third, while human
capital adjustment increases the quality of the factor labor, a parametric pension reform through
increasing the retirement age will increase the quantity of labor. This will increase per capita
productivity further. In addition to this direct effect, increasing the retirement age will also extend the worklife planning horizon of households. This amplifies the incentives to accumulate
human capital.
Point of departure of our analysis is the demographic evolution in two world regions, the
major industrial countries and the rest of the world. As the distinctive feature of the two regions
is their population structure, we will call the industrialized countries “old” and the developing
countries “young”. The left panel of figure 1 illustrates the impact of demographic change on
the working-age population ratio — the ratio of the working-age population (of age 16 − 64)
to the total adult population (of age 16 − 90) — and the right panel the old-age dependency
ratio — the ratio of the old population of age 65 − 90 to the working-age population — in these
regions. As the figure shows, the demographic structure is subject to significant changes over
time in both regions. Currently, there are large level differences but overall demographic trends
are very similar.
We feed these demographic data into an Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987) style overlapping
generations (OLG) model with two integrated world regions, endogenous labor supply decisions
and endogenous human capital formation. Our model builds on Ludwig, Schelkle, and Vogel
(2012) who focus at the US as a closed economy and ignore any adjustments of the retirement
age. Our extensions of this earlier work allow us to compare different adjustments — which
have been identified as important in previous literature — within one coherent framework and
to highlight interactions. Despite these conceptual differences to earlier work, we also take a
broader view in that we focus on the group of industrialized “old” countries in an integrated
world and not the US in isolation.
As the central part of our analysis we work out the quantitative differences between a benchmark model — with open economies and endogenous human capital formation — and counterfactual models where countries operate as closed economies and where human capital may be

exogenous. Along this line we emphasize the role of pension policy. We combine our pension
reform of increasing the retirement age with two pension scenarios of a stylized pay-as-you-go
(PAYGO) pension system. In these scenarios either the contribution or the benefit level is held
constant and — given a balanced budget and the demographic trends as displayed in figure 1 —
benefits or contributions adjust.
Our main findings about the general equilibrium feedback effects of aging — concentrating
on our constant contribution rate pension scenario — can be summarized as follows. First,
newborn agents gain from increasing wages and decreasing returns. Expressed as consumption
equivalent variations, these welfare gains are between 0.8% and 1.1% of lifetime utility. Middleaged and asset rich households experience losses between 3.6% and 6.5%. The size of this
range strongly depends on the adjustment of human capital and the retirement age. These
losses must be compared with strong welfare gains for all future generations. Second, while
openness to international capital markets affects our predictions for per capita GDP and other
macroeconomic aggregates, the impact of openness on rates of return to physical capital and
wages is relatively small. This is due to the fact that the group of old countries is relatively
open to the rest of the world already today and demographic trends across the world regions
regions which cause price changes over time are so similar, cf. figure 1. Consequently, welfare
of generations that live through the demographic transition is relatively little affected by the
degree of capital market openness. Third, endogenous human capital formation has strong
welfare effects. In the open economy, maximum welfare losses of middle-aged households
shrink from 6.5% to 4.4% when human capital can endogenously adjust. Fourth, increasing
the retirement age has similarly strong welfare effects: maximum welfare losses of middleaged households further shrink from 4.4% to 3.6% when the retirement age is increased. We
also document that changes in retirement legislation lead to very small feedback effects at the
intensive margin. Hence, reform “backlashes” (Börsch-Supan and Ludwig 2009), are relatively
small. We therefore conclude that increasing the retirement age is a very effective reform. Our
qualitative finding — that endogenous human capital is an important adjustment mechanism —
holds also in a world where we keep benefits constant and increase contributions. However, as
this pushes up contribution rates the potentially welfare improving effect of human capital is
3

significantly dampened.
In closed economies İmrohoroğlu et al. (1995), Fuster, İmrohoroğlu, and İmrohoroğlu
(2007) Huang et al. (1997), and De Nardi et al. (1999) quantify the effects of social security adjustments on factor prices and welfare. In open economies, Domeij and Flodén (2006),
Bösch-Supan et al. (2006), Fehr et al. (2005), Attanasio et al. (2007) and Krüger and Ludwig
(2007), among others, investigate the role of international capital flows during the demographic
transition. Storesletten (2000) examines the effect of migration to industrialized countries as
a means to take pressure from social security systems. The effects of increased human capital
accumulation is examined by Fougère and Mérette (1999), Sadahiro and Shimasawa (2002),
Buyse et al. (2012), Ludwig, Schelkle, and Vogel (2012) and Heijdra and Reijnders (2012).
This work uses some version of the seminal paper by Ben-Porath (1967)1 and concludes that
human capital adjustments may significantly mitigate the adverse consequences of demographic
change.
While evidence of the effect of changes in the mandatory retirement age in the quantitative literature is scarce, there is a growing number of empirical papers estimating the effect of
pension system reforms on old-age labor supply and actual retirement age. For instance, Mastrobuoni (2009), Hurd and Rohwedder (2011) and French and Jones (2012) document that the
response of older workers to changes in retirement age legislation is large (extensive margin)
whereby younger workers do not react much (intensive margin), just as we find.2 While in
this paper we ignore the link between human capital accumulation endogenous growth in the
long-term, there is a considerable number of contributions shedding light on this topic.3
The remainder of our analysis is organized as follows. In section 2 we present the formal
structure of our quantitative model. Section 3 describes the calibration strategy and our computational solution method. Our results are presented in section 4. Finally, section 5 concludes
the paper. Detailed descriptions of computational methods and additional results are relegated
to separate appendices.
2 The Model
We use a large scale multi-country OLG model in the spirit of Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987)
with endogenous labor supply, human capital formation and a standard consumption-saving
decision. Our model extends Ludwig, Schelkle, and Vogel (2012) to an open economy setup
and a flexible treatment of the retirement age. The population structure is exogenously determined by time and region specific demographic processes for fertility, mortality, and migration,
the exogenous driving force of the model.4 The world population is divided into 2 regions.
We group countries into one of the two regions according to their demographic and economic
1 The

model developed by Ben-Porath (1967) is the workhorse model to understand questions linked to any sort of human
capital accumulation and wage growth over the life cycle (see Browning, Hansen, and Heckman (1999) for a review). Further,
Heckman, Lochner, and Taber (1998), Guvenen and Kuruscu (2009), and Huggett, Ventura, and Yaron (2012) used the model to
explain changes in income inequality.
2 Similarly, Imrohoroglu and Kitao (2009) find in a calibrated life cycle model that privatizing the social security system has
large effects on the reallocation over the life cycle but small effects on aggregate labor supply.
3 See, e.g., de la Croix and Licandro (1999), Echevarrı́a and Iza (2006), Ludwig, Schelkle, and Vogel (2007), Heijdra and
Romp (2009a) and Lee and Mason (2010).
4 Although changes in prices may have — via numerous mechanisms — feedback effects on life expectancy, fertility, and
migration we abstract from examining these channels. See Liao (2011) for a decomposition of economic growth into effects
caused by demographics (endogenous fertility) and technological progress.

stage of development. Our first region — which we label “old” — consists of industrialized
nations: USA, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Norway and the EU-15.
The second (“young”) region consists of all other countries. Demographic processes within the
set of countries are rather synchronized. Therefore intra-regional demographic differences do
not matter much for international capital flows. The quantitatively important capital flows will
occur between the two regions. Further — although timing and extent vary — most countries
in Europe currently implement pension reforms aiming at an increase in the retirement age.
Hence, assuming a perfectly aligned pension reform for the whole region captures the general
dynamics of these adjustments.
We follow Buiter and Kletzer (1995) and assume that physical capital is perfectly mobile
whereas human capital (labor) is immobile. Firms produce with a standard constant returns to
scale production function in a perfectly competitive environment. Agents contribute a share
of their wage to the pension system and retirees receive a share of current net wages as pensions. Growth of labor productivity in the steady-state is exogenous but it fluctuates during the
transition as agents adjust their pattern of human capital investment.
2.1 Timing, Demographics and Notation
The model is cast in discrete time with time t being measured in calender years. Each year, a
new cohort enters the economy. Since agents are inactive before they enter the labor market,
entering the economy refers to the first time agents make own decisions and is set to real life
age of 16 (model age j = 0). In the benchmark scenario agents retire at an exogenously given
age of 65 (model age jr = 49) and live at most until age 90 (model age j = J = 74). Both
numbers are identical across regions. At a given point in time t, individuals of age j in country
i survive to age j + 1 with probability φt, j,i , where φt,J,i = 0. The number of agents of age j
at time t in country i is denoted by Nt, j,i and Nt,i = ∑Jj=0 Nt, j,i is total population in t, i. In the
demographic projections migration happens at the age of 16. Thus, we implicitly assume that
new migrants are born with the initial human capital endowment and human capital production
function of natives. This assumption is consistent with Hanushek and Kimko (2000) who show
that individual productivity (and thus human capital) of workers appears mainly to be related to
a country’s level of schooling and not to cultural factors.
2.2 Households
Households are populated by one representative agent deciding about consumption, saving, labor supply, and time investment into human capital formation. The remaining time is consumed
as leisure. A household in region i maximizes lifetime utility at the beginning of economic life

(1)

where the per period utility function takes consumption c, working hours ℓ and time spent on
increasing the stock of human capital e, as inputs. Standardizing the time endowment to unity
leaves 1 − ℓ − e as leisure time. ϕ is the consumption elasticity in utility, β is the raw time
discount factor, and σ is the inverse of the inter-temporal elasticity of substitution with respect

5

to the consumption-leisure aggregate. πt, j,i denotes the unconditional probability to survive
j−1
until age j, πt, j,i = ∏k=0 φt+k,k,i , for j > 0 and πt,0,i = 1.
Agents earn labor income (pensions if retired), interest payments on their physical assets,
and receive accidental bequests. Social security contributions are a share τt,i of their gross
wages. Net wage income in period t of an agent of age j living in region i is given by
wt,n j,i = ℓt, j,i ht, j,i wt,i (1 − τt,i ), where wt,i is the (gross) wage per unit of supplied human capital at time t in region i. Annuity markets are missing and accidental bequests are distributed
by the government as lump-sum payments to households. The household’s dynamic budget
constraint is given by
{
(at, j,i + trt,i )(1 + rt ) + wt,n j,i − ct, j,i if j < jr
(2)
at+1, j+1,i =
(at, j,i + trt,i )(1 + rt ) + pt, j,i − ct, j,i if j ≥ jr,
where at, j,i denotes assets, pt, j,i is pension income, trt,i are transfers from accidental bequests,
and rt is the real interest rate, the rate of return to physical capital. Household start without
assets (at,0,i = 0) and do not intend to leave bequests to the next generation (at,J+1,i = 0).
2.3 Formation of Human Capital
The initial level of human capital ht,0,i = h0 is exogenously given, identical across households
of a birth cohort and cohort invariant. Then, at any point in time agents can spend a fraction of
their time to build human capital. We employ a frequently used twist of the Ben-Porath (1967)
human capital technology given by
ht+1, j+1,i = ht, j,i (1 − δih ) + ξi (ht, j,i et, j,i )ψi

ψi ∈ (0, 1), ξi > 0, δih ≥ 0,

(3)

where ξi is a scaling factor, ψi determines the curvature of the human capital technology and δih
is the depreciation rate of human capital. Parameters of the production function vary across
countries to allow for region-specific human capital profiles during our calibration period.5
Since we do not model any other labor market frictions6 or costs of human capital acquisition
this is the only way to replicate observed differences in age-wage profiles. However, we adjust
parameters such that they are eventually identical in both regions and thus agents will have —
everything else equal — the same life cycle human capital profile in the final steady state (see
section 3.3).
Investment into human capital requires only the input of time. Opportunity costs of human
capital accumulation are not only forgone wages but also the utility loss due to less leisure. As
we do not model formal education and on-the-job-experience (learning-by-doing) separately,
the accumulation of human capital is a mixture of formal and informal training programs. Human capital can be accumulated at all stages of the life-cycle but optimal behavior implies that
agents will spend more time on building human capital early in life and stop investing some
years before retirement.

parameters.

change.

2.4 Firms
There is a large number of firms in a perfectly competitive environment producing a homogenous good (which can be consumed or invested) using the Cobb-Douglas technology
α
Yt,i = Kt,i
(At,i Lt,i )1−α .

(4)

Here, α denotes the share of capital used in production. Kt,i , Lt,i and At,i are region-specific
stocks of physical capital, effective labor and the level of technology, respectively. Labor inputs
and human capital of different agents (of different age) are perfect substitutes. Aggregate effecjr−1
tive labor input Lt,i is then given by Lt,i = ∑ j=0 ℓt, j,i ht, j,i Nt, j,i . Factors of production are paid
their marginal products, i.e.,
wt,i = (1 − α )At,i ktα
Kt,i
kt = kt,i =
At,i Lt,i

rt = α ktα −1 − δ ,

(5a)
(5b)

where wt,i is the gross wage per unit of efficient labor, rt is the interest rate and δt denotes the
depreciation rate of physical capital. Since we have frictionless international capital markets,
capital stocks kt,i adjust such that the rate of return is equalized across regions and are therefore
determined by the global capital stock relative to global output (see section on aggregation and
equilibrium for more details). Since agents and their human capital are immobile by assumption,
wages differ across regions and are a function of the country specific productivity At,i . Total
A: A
factor productivity, At,i , is growing at the region-specific exogenous rate gt,i
t+1,i = At,i (1 +
A
gt,i ).
2.5 Capital Markets
We assume that both regions are initially closed economies. Opening up of capital markets
is modeled as a non-expected event. We first solve for the equilibrium transition path of both
economies with agents using only prices and transfers from the closed economy scenario. Then,
we “surprise” agents by opening up capital markets in 1970. Hence, from 1970 onwards there is
only one frictionless capital market and thus the marginal product of capital is equalized across
regions. Our choice is motivated by the fact that 1970 is commonly viewed as the beginning of
the opening up process of capital markets (Broner, Didier, Erce, and Schmukler (2011), Lane
and Milesi-Ferretti (2007) or Reinhart and Rogoff (2008)). The historic event initiating the
liberalization process is, in fact, the break-up of the Bretton Woods System in 1971. Since we
model opening up as a non-expected (zero probability) event, agents can re-optimize only for
their remaining lifetime.
2.6 The Pension System
The pension system is a pay-as-you-go system which is balanced every period by adjusting
inflows (i.e. the contribution rate) or outflows (i.e. the replacement rate). Contributions are a
fraction τt,i of gross wages and retirees receive a fraction ρt,i of current average net wages of
workers as pensions.7 Hence, pensions in each period are given by
pt, j,i = ρt,i (1 − τt,i )wt,i h̄t,i
7 Pension

systems across countries differ along many dimensions all of which we ignore for simplicity. See for instance
(Diamond and Gruber 1999) or Whitehouse (2003) for an overview.

where h̄t,i =

denotes average human capital of workers. Observe that we ignore

an earnings related linkage in our pension benefit formula as done, e.g., in Ludwig, Schelkle,
and Vogel (2012). Hence, we bias upwards the labor supply and human capital accumulation
distortions of our model. Consequently, we bias downwards the endogenous labor supply and
human capital accumulation responses to increases in the retirement age. The budget constraint

We consider two policy scenarios in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the public
pension system. In our first reform scenario we keep the retirement age at the baseline level (65
years). Then, we either hold the contribution rate constant τt,i = τ̄i (labeled “const. τ ”), and
endogenously adjust the replacement rate to balance the budget of the pension system or we
hold the replacement rate constant, ρt,i = ρ̄i (labeled “const. ρ ”), and endogenously adjust the
contribution rate. As the second dimension of pension reforms we increase the normal retirement age. This reform scenario captures two effects on incentives to acquire human capital: a
lengthening of the working life combined with — everything else equal — lowering the tax burden on currently working individuals. In fact, most governments currently implement a mix of
the two strategies. In order to highlight the most extreme economic impact of different reforms,
we perform the two types of policy experiments in isolation.

age j solves in region i, at the beginning of period t, the maximization problem

2.8 Thought Experiments
The exogenous driving force of our model is the time-varying and region specific demographic
structure. The solution of our model is done in two steps. We firstly assume that both regions are
closed and solve for the region specific artificial initial steady state. We then compute the closed
economy equilibrium transition paths to the new steady state. While computing the transition
paths, we include sufficiently many “phase-in” and “phase-out” periods8 to ensure convergence.
Then, we use the distribution of physical capital, human capital and population from the two
closed regions in year 1970 and recompute the equilibrium transition path until the new — open
economy — steady state is reached. Finally, we report simulation results for the main projection
period of interest, from 2010 to 2050. We use data from 1960 − 2005 in order to calibrate the
vector of structural model parameters (cf. section 3).
8 In

fact, changes in variables which are constant in steady state are numerically irrelevant already around 100 periods before
the we impose the steady state restriction.

9

When reporting our results, we will compare time paths of variables of interest across various
model variants for different social security reform scenarios for the old countries.9 Our baseline
model variant (which is also used in calibration) is one with agents adjusting their human capital,
open economy and benchmark retirement age. Hence, our strategy is to first solve and calibrate
for the transitional dynamics using the model as described above. Then, we use the results from
this model to compute average time investment and the associated human capital profile which
is used as input in the alternative model with a fixed productivity profile.10 We obtain the lifecycle profile of time investment into education ē j,i for each age j = 1, 2, . . . , J by averaging over
all life-cycle profiles of agents living during the calibration period.11 The human capital profile
is then computed by substituting the time series ē j,i into (3). Then, we use this profile in all our
experiments with exogenous human capital.
3

Calibration and Computation

The calibration of the model is standard. We choose parameters such that simulated moments
match their counterparts in the data. For the wage profile, we choose parameters such that the
endogenous wage profiles match the empirically observed wage profile during the calibration
period 1960 − 2005 (cf. section 3.3).12 We provide a condensed overview over all parameters
in table 1.
3.1 Demographics
Population data from 1950 − 2005 are taken from the United Nations (2007). For the period
until 2050 we use the same data source and choose the UN’s “medium” variant for the fertility projections. However, we have to forecast population dynamics beyond 2050 to solve our
model. The key assumptions of our projection are as follows: First, for both regions total fertility rate is constant at 2050 levels until 2100. Then we adjust fertility such that the number of
newborns is constant for the rest of the simulation period. Second, we use the life expectancy
forecasted by the United Nations (2007) and extrapolate it until 2100 at the same (region and
gender-specific) linear rate.13 Then we assume that life expectancy in the old nations stays
constant. Life expectancy in the rest of the world keeps rising until it reaches the level of the
old countries by the year 2300. This choice ensures that in the final steady state, the population structure is identical across world regions. By delaying this adjustment process to 2300
we make sure that we exclude any anticipation effects of currently living generations and have

restrict time investment into human capital production to be identical for all cohorts (instead of using each cohort’s own
endogenous profile and keeping it fixed). We do this in order not to change the time endowment available to households from
cohort to cohort.

12 We do the moment matching exercise in the model variant with endogenous human capital and constant contribution rate
scenario with the benchmark retirement age. We do not re-calibrate model parameters across social security scenarios or for the
alternative human capital model, mainly because any parametric change would make comparisons (especially welfare analysis)
across models impossible.
13 Life expectancy estimated by the UN for cohort born in 2050 is in the industrialized nations 81.5 year for men and 86.8 year
for women. In the rest of the world, life expectancy is 71.7 for men and 75.7 for women. The estimates of the trend are as follows:
in the industrialized countries life expectancy at birth increasers for each cohort at a linear rate of 0.12 years for men and 0.117
years for women. For the rest of the world the slope coefficient for is 0.204 for men and 0.217 for women. See also Oeppen and
Vaupel (2002) for the evolution of life expectancy.

a stationary population structure is reached in about 2200 in the old nations and in 2300 in the
rest of the world. While the assumptions from above seem to be arbitrary, they are close to what
is done in the rest of the literature.
3.2 Households
We set σ to 2. This corresponds to a standard estimate of the IES of 0.5 (Hall 1988). The
pure time discount factor β is chosen to match the empirical capital-output ratio of 2.8 in the
old countries which requires β = 0.98. To calibrate the weight of consumption in the utility
function, we set ϕ = 0.37 by targeting an average labor supply of 1/3 of the total available time.
We constrain the parameters of the utility function to be identical across regions.
3.3

Individual Productivity and Labor Supply

We follow Ludwig, Schelkle, and Vogel (2012) and choose the parameters of the human capital
production function such that average wage profiles resulting from endogenous human capital
model replicate empirically observed wage profiles. The estimates of wage profiles are based on
PSID data, adopting the procedure of Huggett et al. (2012). After normalizing the initial value
of human capital to h0 = 1 we determine the value of the structural parameters {ξi , ψi , δih }Ii=1
using indirect inference methods (Smith 1993; Gourieroux et al. 1993). To do this, we run
regressions on the wage profiles obtained from the simulation and the observed data on a 3rdorder polynomial in age defined as
log w j,i = λ0,i + λ1,i j + λ2,i j2 + λ3,i j3 + ε j,i .

(11)

where w j,i denotes age specific productivity. We write the coefficient vector from the regression
on the observed wage data as λid = [λ1,i , λ2,i , λ3,i ]′ and the one from the simulated human capital
profile of cohorts born in 1960 − 2005 by λ̂ s = [λ̂1,i , λ̂2,i , λ̂3,i ]′ . The vector λ̂ s is then a function of the deep structural parameters {ξi , ψi , δih }Ii=1 . We choose the values for the structural
parameters by minimizing the distance between the values of the polynomial obtained from
the regression on the actual data and the simulated data, i.e. minimizing ∥λid − λ̂is ∥ ∀i, see
subsection 3.6 for computational details.
Figure 2 presents the empirically observed productivity profile and the estimated polynomials for the different regions. The coefficients14 and the shape of the wage profile are in line
with the literature, e.g. number reported by Altig et al. (2001) and Hansen (1993). The value
of ψ ≈ 0.60 is also in the middle of the range reported in Browning, Hansen, and Heckman
(1999). The depreciation rate of human capital is δ h = 1.4% for young and δ h = 0.9% for old
countries. Although there is a considerable disagreement about δ h in the literature, our numbers are in reasonable range (see e.g. Arrazola and de Hevia (2004), Browning, Hansen, and
Heckman (1999)).
Due to lack of reliable individual wage data or good estimates for age-wage profiles we
cannot apply the same technique to young countries. Instead, we take the polynomial estimated
on the U.S.-profile and scale coefficient λ1 by a factor of 0.95. The resulting age-wage profile
coefficient estimates from the regression on the US profiles are λ0 : -1.6262, λ1 : 0.1054, λ2 : -0.0017 and λ3 : 7.83e-06.
The coefficients for the young countries are identical except for λ1 which is scaled by 0.95.
14 The

11

corresponds to a profile estimated on Mexican data by Attanasio, Kitao, and Violante (2007).
The main difference between the two profiles is that wages in the U.S. drop by 10% and Mexican
wages by 20% from their peak to retirement age and that the maximal wage in the U.S. is about
100% higher than the wage at entry into the labor market. The same number in Mexico is
about 90%. Attanasio et al. (2007) attribute these differences — US profiles are steeper and
drop less towards the end of working life — to differences in the physical requirements in the
two economies. Working in the probably less human capital intensive Mexican labor market
requires relatively more physical strength. This is likely to imply that the peak is reached earlier
and that productivity decreases faster afterwards. Further supportive evidence on flatter profiles
is provided by Lagakos, Moll, Porzio, and Qian (2012). Using a panel with 48 developing
and developed countries, they find that age-experience profiles are much steeper in developed
countries.

To minimize biases, we adjust the parameters of the human capital production function such
that they are eventually identical in both regions. To this end we parameterize the adjustment
path and calibrate it such that parameters start to change for the cohort born in year 2100 and are
identical for the cohort born in year 2300. We denote the vector of parameters {ξi , ψi , δih } = ⃗χi
and assume that

3.4

Production

The share of capital in production is set to α = 0.33 such that we match the share of capital income in national accounts. The average growth rate of total factor productivity, ḡAi , is calibrated
such that we match the region-specific growth rate of GDP per capita, taken from Maddison
(2003). Growth of output per capita in the old countries during our calibration period is 2.8%.
Accordingly, we set the growth rate of TFP to 1.85% to meet our calibration target. To match
12

the observed growth of GDP per capita of 2.2% in the young countries, we let TFP grow at a
rate of 1.5%. From 2100 onwards we let the growth rate of TFP in the young countries adjust
smoothly to the growth rate in the old countries. This adjustment process is assumed to be completed in 2300. Further, we compute relative GDP per capita from Maddison (2003) for both
regions in 1950 and use this ratio to calibrate the relative productivity levels at the beginning of
the calibration period. Initially, per capita GDP in the young countries is only 20% of income
per capita in the old nations. Finally, we calibrate δ such that our simulated data match an
average investment output ratio of 20% in the old countries which requires δ = 0.035.
3.5

The Pension System

In our first social security scenario (“const. τ ”) we fix contribution rates and adjust replacement
rates of the pension system. Since there is no yearly data on contribution rates for sufficiently
many countries, we use data from Palacios and Pallarés-Miralles (2000) for the mid 1990s
and assume that the contribution rate was constant through the entire calibration period. On
the individual country level, we use the pension tax as a share of total labor costs weighted
by the share of contributing workers to compute a national average. Then we weight these
numbers by total GDP to compute a representative number for the two world regions. The
contribution rate in the young (old) region is then 4.1% (10.9%). Given the initial demographic
structures, the replacement rate is 13.8% (20.4%) in the young (old) region. In our baseline
social security scenario we freeze the contribution rate at the level used for the calibration
period for all following years. When simulating the alternative social security scenario with
constant replacement rates (“const. ρ ”) we feed the equilibrium replacement rate obtained in
the “const. τ ” scenario into the model and hold it constant at the level of year 2000 for all
remaining years. Then, the contribution rate endogenously adjusts each period to balance the
budget of the social security system. In both scenarios we assume that the retirement age is
fixed at 65 years and agents do not expect any change. We label this scenario as “Benchmark”
(“BM”) in the following analysis.
For the second type of policy reform we increase the retirement age by linking it to remaining
life expectancy at age 65 (the current retirement age). We assume that for an increase in conditional life expectancy by 1.5 years, retirement increases by one year. We model this change
— labeled “Pension Reform” (“PR”) — by assuming that this reform affects already workers
in the labor market in 1955 (birth cohort 1939) by raising their retirement age immediately by
one year and thereby effectively increasing the number of workers already in 2001. We then
apply this rule for all following cohorts. This pattern mimics recent pension reforms in many
old countries.15 This reform has direct effects via lengthening expected lifetime labor supply
of workers and changing prices for retirees. Given our projections of life expectancy, the retirement age will eventually settle down at 71 years, a value also discussed in the public debate
about pension reforms. We show the stepwise increase in the retirement age in figure 3 as a
function of the respective labor market cohort.
3.6 Computational Method
For a given set of structural model parameters, we solve the model by iterating on household
related variables (inner loop) and aggregate variables (outer loop). In the outer loop, we solve

for the equilibrium by making an initial guess about the time path of the following variables: the
capital intensity, the ratio of bequests to wages, the replacement rate (or contribution rate) of the
pension system and the average human capital stock for all periods from t = 0, 1, . . . , T . For the
open economy we impose the restriction of identical capital intensity for both regions but require
all other variables from above to converge for each country separately. On the households level
(inner loop), we start by guessing {cJ , hJ }, i.e. the terminal values for consumption and human
capital. Then we iterate on them until convergence of the inner loop as defined by some metric.
In each outer loop, household variables are aggregated in each iteration for all periods. Values
for the aggregate time series are then updated using the Gauss-Seidel-Quasi-Newton algorithm
suggested in Ludwig (2007) until convergence.
To calibrate the model (we do this in the“const. τ ” scenario, benchmark retirement), we run
additional “outer outer” loops on the vector of structural model parameters in order to minimize
the distance between moments computed from the simulated data and their corresponding calibration targets for the calibration period 1960 − 2005. In a nutshell, the common parameter
values determined in this procedure are β , ϕ , δ , and the country and specific parameters of the
human capital production function {ξi , ψi , δih }.

Results

We divide the presentation of results into three parts. In the first part, in subsection 4.1, we look
at the evolution of economic aggregates such as the rate of return of detrended GDP per capita
along the transition. When we evaluate future trends of economic aggregates in this first part,
we do so in two steps.
In our first step, we look at a comparison of open and counterfactual closed economy versions of our model for two pension scenarios (a “fixed contribution rate” and a “fixed replacement rate” system) and two human capital scenarios (“exogenous” versus “endogenous” human
capital). What we learn from this exercise is that openness matters for the evolution of aggregates such as GDP per capita but, probably surprisingly, not so much for rates of return. What

matters more for the time path of the latter is whether human capital is endogenous and how the
pension system is designed.
In our second step, we evaluate how our findings are affected by increasing the retirement
age. To distinguish increases in the retirement age semantically from the aforementioned pension “scenarios”, we label the experiment of increasing the retirement age as a “pension reform”
(“PR”). Given our findings from the first step, we focus our analysis only at the more realistic
and policy relevant open economy model version of our model. We find that increasing the
retirement age, by increasing labor supply and human capital, will significantly alter the time
paths of future rates of return to capital and wages.
In the second part, subsection 4.2, we shed more light on how the increase in retirement age
affects effective labor supply. We ask how much of the exogenous increase in the retirement
age (extensive margin) is potentially offset by adverse endogenous labor supply reactions at
the intensive margin. Overall, we find little response at the intensive labor supply margin.
Consequently, increasing the retirement age is a very effective reform. However, we ignore the
endogenous adjustment of retirement to policy, as done by, e.g., Heijdra and Romp (2009b)
and Buyse et al. (2012). We leave extensions of our work along these dimensions for future
research.
In the third part, subsection 4.3, we evaluate welfare of households who live through the
demographic transition and show that endogenous formation of human capital and the design
of the pension system are — via future time paths of wages and returns — key for the welfare
effects of aging. Consistently with the literature16 , we find that, when the contribution rate
is held constant, increasing wages dominate for newborn households who experience welfare
gains whereby the converse applies to old and asset rich households. Gains of the young (and
losses of the old) are significantly higher (lower) when human capital can endogenously adjust
and when the retirement age increases. On the contrary, welfare differences between our closed

4.1 Macroeconomic Aggregates
Aggregate Variables for the Benchmark Model
Figures 4(a) and 4(b) depict the evolution of contribution and replacement rates for the benchmark pension system. Holding the replacement rate constant at 16.4% requires an increase of
the contribution rate to 18% in 2050. Conversely, keeping the contribution rate unchanged during the entire period at 10.9% requires a drop in the replacement rate to 9.4% until 2050. Small
differences emanate in the graphs for the closed and open economy scenarios of our model.
These are induced by differential paths of wages and labor supply as well as human capital
formation in the respective model variants.

Notes: “Open” and “Closed” refer to the results obtained from the closed and open economy versions.
All results obtained from the endogenous human capital scenario, benchmark pension system with
constant retirement age (“BM”).

The evolution of important macroeconomic variables for the scenario with constant contribution rate (“const. τ ”) is presented in figure 5. As in this subsection we concentrate on the model
comparison across capital market scenarios we report results for the alternative adjustment of
the pension system (“const. ρ ”) in figure 10 in appendix B.
Figure 5(a) shows the evolution of the rate of return to physical capital for different model
variants. Looking at the development of the rate of return in a closed economy we observe the
well known result of falling returns due to population aging. However, we also observe that
the drop in the interest rate is much lower in the model where human capital is endogenous as
opposed to the “standard” model with an exogenously given life cycle productivity profile. This
effect is the result of higher investment into human capital due to falling returns to physical
capital. In the open economy variant, we observe a qualitatively similar result with two differences. As the young economy is importer of capital, the interest rate in the open economy is
initially higher than in the closed economy. This pattern is reversed after year 2030 when baby
16

boomers retire in the old economy and withdraw their funds (see below). Quantitatively, initial
differences are relatively small when human capital formation is endogenous.
We next report the level of de-trended GDP per capita in figure 5(d) where we have standardized the value for the year 2010 to 100. In both model versions with endogenous human
capital the income level in 2050 is by an economically significant amount above the level of
the “standard” model. This effect is due to more investment into human capital. Turning to the
comparison between closed and open economies we observe that income in 2050 in the open
economy tends to be higher compared to the closed economy (for endogenous and exogenous
human capital).
GDP per capita in the closed economy is initially higher than in the open economy. The
reason is the inflow and outflow of physical capital during the transition period. As can be seen
from figure 5(b), the old region has a positive net foreign asset position until 2035 (2040) in the
version with endogenous (exogenous) human capital. This initial outflow of capital decreases
production at home and thereby GDP per capita. However, as the capital flows are reversed and
capital is repatriated, GDP per capita is surpassing the level of the closed economy.
These differences between the open and closed economy scenarios are most pronounced
when human capital adjusts. This can be seen in figure 5(c). Average human capital is higher
in the open economy compared to the closed economy after 2035. The initially lower time
investment into human capital accumulation in the open economy scenario can be attributed
to the lower wage growth and higher rate of return compared to the closed economy scenario.
In the closed economy, the demographic structure of the old economy leads to relatively more
pronounced accumulation of physical capital which can be only used domestically. Therefore,
opening up the economy and thereby exporting physical capital to regions with higher returns
is initially detrimental for investment into human capital at home.
The most striking result displayed in figure 5(d) is the increase of de-trended per capita GDP,
despite the seemingly detrimental effects of aging on raw labor supply. Endogenous human
capital formation in combination with a constant contribution rate pushes growth rates along
the transition above the long-run trend level of 1.8 percent. On the contrary, de-trended GDP
per capita decreases until about 2030 in the open economy when replacement rates are held
constant. In this case the associated increase in contribution rates — cf. figure 4(b) — reduces
incentives to invest in human capital, cf. figure 10 in appendix B.
Aggregate Variables when the Retirement Age is Increased
We now investigate how our results are affected once we let the retirement age increase according to the pattern shown in figure 3. To focus our analysis, we do so in our benchmark open
economy model with endogenous human capital formation. We continue with our comparison
across the two pension designs — constant contribution and constant replacement rates.
Figure 6 displays the associated time paths of replacement and contribution rates. Observe
that, in case of a fixed contribution (replacement) rate, the base replacement (contribution) rate
is higher when the retirement age adjusts. This is so for mainly two reasons. First, there is
a higher exogenous amount of raw labor in the economy. Second, as shown below, higher
retirement ages increase the incentive to invest in human capital. Hence, also the quality of
labor is higher when retirement ages are raised. The figure also displays jumps in the relevant
variables. This is due to the fact that our smallest unit of time is one calendar year and it

Notes: Results from the model with endogenous human capital and open capital markets.

Our results of this experiment on macroeconomic variables are summarized in figure 7. Increasing the retirement age has strong effects. The level of rates of returns are significantly
higher than in our benchmark scenario. This is so because of the aforementioned effects of
increasing the retirement age on total effective labor supply. As a consequence, even when replacement rates are held constant — and contribution rates adjust correspondingly — GDP per
capita is now found to increase.
Notice that in the endogenous human capital model the effect of increasing the retirement
age is stronger in the constant replacement rate scenario (e.g., compare panels (c) and (d) of
figure 7). To understand this, recall from figure 6 that the increase of contribution rates is
substantially dampened in the reform “PR”. The overall tax burden is therefore lowered which
induces additional incentives to invest in human capital. On the contrary, in the constant contribution rate scenario, the replacement rate decreases by less. This just has the opposite incentive
effects on human capital formation.
In figure 11 in appendix B we plot changes in the same variables for the model with exogenous human capital. As expected, when human capital cannot adjust the effect of a higher
retirement age are generally found to be smaller.
4.2 Labor Supply over the Life Cycle
To understand the effects of the pension reform on aggregate hours and human capital, it is
key to understand the response over the life cycle. Theoretical insights into these life cycle
effects are developed in appendix B.2 by use of a simple two-period model. To shed light on
these adjustments quantitatively, we isolate the effects induced by a change in the retirement
age from changes induced by general equilibrium feedback.
First, we define our benchmark to be the cohort entering the labor market in 1955. This is
the first cohort affected by an increase of the normal retirement age. Then, we take general

equilibrium prices and policy instruments from the benchmark economy (with retirement age at
65) and increase the retirement age. This enables us to compare household decisions in partial
equilibrium. In order to isolate the different adjustment channels — labor supply and human
capital — in this partial equilibrium setting we perform three experiments. We start by holding
constant the human capital profile and endogenously compute labor supply. We next hold the
labor supply profile fixed and allow human capital to adjust. Finally, we allow labor supply and
human capital to be endogenous and thereby capture the total effect (in partial equilibrium). As
a last step, we compare our results to the life cycle profiles of households observed in general
equilibrium after implementation of the pension reform.
Results of this decomposition analysis are summarized in figure 8 as percent deviations from
the benchmark life cycle profile. Ignoring general equilibrium adjustments and human capital
accumulation, an increase in the retirement age has a negligible impact on labor supply at the
intensive margin. With both margins of adjustment at work (“both endogenous”) the young invest more time in education and hence labor supply decreases relative to the benchmark. Older
agents work more to reap the benefits of higher levels of human capital. These predictions
are consistent with the theoretical model in the appendix (cf.equation (29)). Finally, in general
equilibrium, the endogenous labor supply and human capital response leads to higher pension
payments, lower increases in wages and relatively higher interest rates. This mitigates the incentives to invest into human capital and increases (decreases) labor supply when young (old)
relative to the case with constant prices. As a consequence, once all general equilibrium adjustments are considered, incentives to work and invest into human capital are weakened and lead
only to a small change of labor supply at the intensive margin.

Table 2 documents the total effect of these behavioral adjustments as the sum of changes of
life cycle allocations shown in the previous figure. Moving from left to right in the table, we
observe a reaction of labor supply at the intensive margin in partial equilibrium only when education and hours worked are simultaneously endogenous. This is offset in general equilibrium.
We can therefore conclude that the exogenous increase of the retirement age has a significant
21

impact on total aggregate effective labor supply only by inducing agents to work more in the
marginal year and investing more into human capital. On the contrary, reactions at the intensive
margin only shift allocations over the life cycle without affecting the aggregate much.17
These quantitative responses are in line with empirical estimates. As Mastrobuoni (2009)
shows, more than half of the increase in retirement age in the US is taken up by agents. In table
2 (rightmost column) we show that the increase in hours in the additional year corresponds to
an implicit pass-through of roughly 64% which we believe to be a reasonable approximation of
the empirical results.18 Therefore, although our model misses endogenous retirement choice as
a decision at the extensive margin, we are confident that our quantitative predictions resulting
from endogenous labor supply adjustments are about right.
A key aspect in this context is the elasticity of labor supply. As discussed in Ludwig,
Schelkle, and Vogel (2012) — especially section 4.1 — alternative measures of labor supply
elasticities range between 1.1 and 1.9 in this type of model. In light of adjustments at the extensive margins and the empirical work by Imai and Keane (2004) — who argue that standard
estimates are downward-biased by not considering endogenous human-capital accumulation
explicitly — this is a reasonable magnitude.

Notes: “Intensive” refers to the total amount of effective labor supply up to the “old” retirement age, “total” adds the additional working year. The variables reported (title of column) is always the endogenous
variable, the other is assumed to be exogenous (see description of methodology above).

4.3 Welfare
In our model, households are affected by three distinct consequences of demographic change
and policy reform. First, for given prices utility increases because survival probabilities increase. Second, households are affected by changes in prices and transfers due to general
equilibrium effects of aging. For cohorts currently alive, these profound changes can have —
depending on the position in the life cycle — positive or negative welfare effects. Third, when
the retirement age is increased, a constraint is relaxed which will lead to welfare gains. Furthermore, as shown above, increasing the retirement age leads to higher levels of rates of return
17 With

the exception of the first few years after the reform during which increased human capital investments through eduction
crowd out labor supply. The effect is, however, small and therefore not shown.
18 If workers would work full time, an increase in the retirement age by one year constitutes an increase of total time by
1
≈ 0.02. However, total hours worked over the working life increase by only about 1.3% which is a pass-through of
about 65−16
about 1.3/2 ≈ 0.64. An alternative estimate of the pass-through would be to argue that hours worked are roughly 1/3 on average
and households of age 65 work about 1/4 of their time in our model, see figure 16 in the appendix so that the pass-through
would be 4/3 · 64% ≈ 85%. We could also view each worker at age 66 as a potential full-time worker who then decides to spend
roughly 25% of time working, then the pass-through would be 25%.

22

(lower wages) and lower decreases of the rate of return as societies are aging — cf. figures 7(a)
and 7(b) — with associated feedback into welfare consequences
We want to isolate and quantify the effect of changing prices, taxes and transfers as well as
increasing the retirement age on households’ lifetime utility. To this end, we first compute the
(remaining) lifetime utility of an agent of age j born in year t using the full set of (time varying)
general equilibrium prices, taxes and transfers. Then, we hold all prices and transfers constant
at their respective year 2010 value and recompute agent’s remaining lifetime utility. For both
scenarios we keep constant survival probabilities at their year 2010 values. We compute the
consumption equivalent variation, gt, j,i , i.e., the percentage of consumption that needs to be
given to the agent at each date for her remaining lifetime at prices from 2010 in order to make
her indifferent between the two scenarios. Positive values of gt, j,i thus indicate welfare gains
from the general equilibrium effects of aging.19 In order to isolate the effects of changing
prices, taxes and transfers, we do not account for the gain in households’ lifetime utility during
the additional life years generated by the increase in life expectancy.
In the remainder of this section we stick to the structure from the previous section. We first
report numbers from our welfare analysis for agents living in the benchmark pension scenario
holding the retirement age constant. Then we advance to the comparison of the effects of
increasing the retirement age. To work out distributional consequences across generations, we
first look at welfare consequences for agents alive in 2010, followed by an analysis of welfare
of future generations.
Welfare of Generations Alive in 2010 in the Benchmark Model
The analysis in this section performs an inter-generational welfare comparison of the consequences of demographic change holding the retirement age at the current benchmark level. The
results for the “const ρ ” (“const τ ”) scenario are shown in figures 9(a) and 9(b). They can be
summarized as follows: for constant contribution rates, newborns in the endogenous (exogenous) model benefit up to 0.7% (0.4%) of lifetime consumption from the general equilibrium
effects of aging. This is due to increasing wages and decreasing interest rates. Higher wage
growth makes investment into human capital more attractive and falling interest rates decrease
the costs of borrowing. Middle aged agents with high levels of physical assets incur welfare
losses due to falling interest rates. Further, their ability to change human capital investment is
restricted as they are in a relatively advanced stage of their life cycle. Retired agents additionally incur losses from falling pensions (due to constant contribution rates).
Of particular interest is that agents in the endogenous human capital investment model incur
much lower losses compared to households with a fixed human capital profile. With endogenous
human capital, maximum losses are about 32% lower compared to the model with a fixed human
capital profile. Thus, agents with the possibility to react to changing prices will do so and this
decreases their potential losses by a considerable amount.
On the contrary, openness per se does not have strong effects on welfare. This is directly
related to our insights from the previous part where we have shown that time paths of rates of

return to physical capital (and thereby wages) do not differ much between our open and our
counterfactual closed economy scenario. Welfare results for the closed economy are shown in
figure 12 in appendix B.
In the constant replacement rate scenario the majority of the population loses from the effects
of demographic change. Young agents are worse off as constant replacement rates require rising
contributions which depresses net wages and incentives to invest in human capital. Very old
agents experience small gains in lifetime utility due to rising pensions. Also notice that welfare
consequences are more evenly distributed under constant replacement rates where maximum
losses are considerably smaller than with constant contribution rates.20
We also summarize welfare consequences for newborns in our benchmark economy with
open capital markets in table 3 and the maximum welfare losses in table 4. Results for the

Welfare of Generations Alive in 2010 when the Retirement Age is Increased
We next look at differences in welfare changes for agents living in 2010 across all pension
reform scenarios. For sake of brevity, we focus on the summary of results in tables 3 and 4
and relegate the corresponding figure 13 to appendix B. Gains to newborn households increase
by 0.3 to 0.4 percentage points under constant replacement rates and losses decrease by more
than one percentage point under constant replacement rates.21
Welfare of Future Generations in the Benchmark Model
We now report welfare changes for newborns between 2010 and 2050, see figure 14 in appendix B. Holding the replacement rate constant has a strong negative impact on lifetime utility
for future generations. Even with endogenous investment into human capital, maximum welfare
losses can be up to 7% (5.9%) in the open (closed) economy. With an exogenous efficiency profile, losses are even higher. With constant contribution rates, newborns gain up to 2.5% (1.5%)
in the open (closed) economy and endogenous human capital investment.
Welfare of Future Generations when the Retirement Age is Increased
In case of constant replacement rates, increasing the retirement age cannot totally eliminate
welfare losses from demographic change, see figure 15 in appendix B. However, the effect is
strong. In case of endogenous human capital, welfare losses of the cohort born in 2050 are now
at −2.6%, compared to −5.9% without the reform.
5 Conclusion
This paper revisits the literature on the consequences of demographic change — aging – for
welfare of generations who live through the demographic transition in industrialized countries
21 GDP

per capita and welfare increase due to higher capital accumulation and exogenous technical progress. Our methodology
to measure general equilibrium feedback effects, however, neglects these effects as we compare changing with constant prices
(“purged” from aging induced effects) for any level of GDP per capita. In other words, for any cohort the level of GDP is identical
for both scenarios at the beginning of the life-cycle but prices diverge later on.

25

by asking a straightforward question: How can the potentially detrimental consequences of aging of the group of industrialized countries be mitigated by two margins of adjustment, namely
investing abroad and human capital formation? We address this question in combination with
pension policy. That is, we ask how the design of pension policy may contribute to dampening
via these endogenous channels.
We conclude with a negative and a positive finding. Our negative finding is that openness
to international capital markets has only modest welfare implications vis-a-vis a counterfactual
closed economy world. The reason for this is that overall demographic trends across our two
highly aggregate world regions are very similar (despite strong differences in levels and the
heterogeneity within each region). To the extent that the group of industrialized countries is
relatively open to the rest of the world already today, this leads to relatively small price changes
over time when we contrast an open economy scenario with a counterfactual closed economy
scenario. Small price differences in turn lead to small welfare changes.
Our positive finding is that endogenous human capital formation in combination with constant contribution rates to the pension system and increases of the statutory retirement age has
strong welfare effects. We find that, in general equilibrium, the exogenous increase of the retirement age translates almost one for one into labor market participation of the elderly while
there is almost no reaction at the intensive margin of those already working. Hence, “reform
backlashes” (Börsch-Supan and Ludwig 2009) are small and effective labor supply is consequently increased quite strongly. This leads to strong welfare gains for all future generations
(under constant contribution rates). Welfare losses for middle aged and asset rich households
who suffer from decreasing returns on savings and decreasing pension payments are 6.5% if
human capital cannot adjust and if the statutory retirement age is held constant. These losses
decrease to 3.6% if human capital endogenously adjusts and increases of the retirement age
roughly track life expectancy.
Our main conclusion is therefore that labor market policies focusing at the extensive margin
(by increasing the retirement age) and adjustments at the education margin are key to mitigate
the adverse effects of demographic change. However, we only model labor supply decisions at
the intensive margin, treating retirement as exogenous. While we document that our estimates of
endogenous labor supply adjustments to changes in the exogenous reform of the retirement age
are reasonable, one may still argue that it is important to explicitly model the endogenous choice
of retirement at the extensive margin. We plan to extend our model along these dimensions in
our future research.

A.1 Household Problem
To simplify the description of the solution of the household model for given prices (wage and
interest rate), transfers and social security payments, we focus on steady states and therefore
drop the time index t and the country index i. Furthermore, we focus on a de-trended version
of the household problem in which all variables x are transformed to x̃ = Ax where A is the
technology level growing at the exogenous rate g. To simplify notation, we do not denote
variables by the symbol ˜· but assume that the transformation is understood. The de-trended
version of the household problem is then given by

where we have also replaced the bounded support of time investment and leisure with a one-side
constraint on ℓ because the upper constraints, ℓ = 1, respectively e = 1, and the lower constraint,
e = 0, are never binding due to Inada conditions on the utility function and the functional form
of the human capital technology (see below). Denoting by µℓ the Lagrange multiplier on the
inequality constraint for ℓ, we can write the first-order conditions as

Note that for the retirement period, i.e. for j ≥ jr, equations (14b) and (14c) are irrelevant and
equation (15b) has to be replaced by
Vh (a, h, j) = β̃ ghVh′ (a′ , h′ , j + 1).
From (14a) and (15a) we get
Va = (1 + r)uc

(16)

and, using the above in (14a), the familiar inter-temporal Euler equation for consumption follows as
uc = β̃

1+r

1+g c

(17)

From (14a) and (14b) we get the familiar intra-temporal Euler equation for leisure,
u1−ℓ−e = hw(1 − τ )uc + µℓ .

(18)

From the human capital technology (3) we further have
ge = ξ ψ (eh)ψ −1 h

(19a)

gh = (1 − δ h ) + ξ ψ (eh)ψ −1 e.

(19b)

We loop backwards in j from j = J −1, . . . , 0 by taking an initial guess of [cJ , hJ ] as given and
by initializing Va′ (·, J) = Vh′ (·, J) = 0. During retirement, that is for all ages j ≥ jr, our solution
procedure is by standard backward shooting using the first-order conditions. However, during
the period of human capital formation, that is for all ages j < jr, the first order conditions would
not be sufficient if the problem is not a convex-programming problem. And thus, our backward
shooting algorithm will not necessarily find the true solution. In fact this may be the case in
human capital models such as ours because the effective wage rate is endogenous (it depends
on the human capital investment decision). For a given initial guess [cJ , hJ ] we therefore first
compute a solution via first-order conditions and then, for each age j < jr, we check whether
this is the unique solution. As an additional check, we consider variations of initial guesses
of [cJ , hJ ] on a large grid. In all of our scenarios we never found any multiplicities.
The details of our steps are as follows:
1. In each j, h j+1 ,Va′ (·, j + 1),Vh′ (·, j + 1) are known.
2. Compute uc from (14a).
3. For j ≥ jr, compute h j from (3) by setting e j = ℓ j = 0 and by taking h j+1 as given and
compute c j directly from equation (23) below.
4. For j < jr:
(a) Assume ℓ ∈ [0, 1) so that µℓ = 0.
(b) Combine (3), (14b), (14c) and (19a) to compute h j as

(d) Calculate lcr j = cjj j , the leisure to consumption ratio from (18) as follows: From
our functional form assumption on utility marginal utilities are given by
(
)−σ
ϕ cϕ −1 (1 − ℓ − e)1−ϕ
uc = cϕ (1 − ℓ − e)1−ϕ
(
)−σ
u1−ℓ−e = cϕ (1 − ℓ − e)1−ϕ
(1 − ϕ )cϕ (1 − ℓ − e)−ϕ
hence we get from (18) the familiar equation:
u1−ℓ−e
1−ϕ

uc

and therefore:
lcr j =

(22)

(e) Next compute c j as follows. Notice first that one may also write marginal utility from
consumption as
uc = ϕ cϕ (1−σ )−1 (1 − ℓ − e)(1−σ )(1−ϕ ) .
(23)
Using (22) in (23) we then get
uc = ϕ cϕ (1−σ )−1 (lcr · c)(1−σ )(1−ϕ )
= ϕ c−σ · lcr(1−σ )(1−ϕ ) .

(24)

Since uc is given from (14a), we can now compute c as

cj = 

(25)

(f) Given c j , e j compute labor, ℓ j , as
ℓ j = 1 − lcr j · c j − e j .
(g) If ℓ j < 0, set ℓ j = 0 and iterate on h j as follows:
i. Guess h j
ii. Compute e as in step 4c.
iii. Noticing that ℓ j = 0, update c j from (23) as

iv. Compute µℓ from (14b) as

µℓ = u1−ℓ−e − β̃ hw(1 − τ )Va′ (·, j + 1)

where e is given from step 4(g)ii. We solve for the root of f to get h j by a nonlinear solver iterating on steps 4(g)ii through 4(g)v until convergence.
5. Update as follows:
(a) Update Va using either (15a) or (16).
(b) Update Vh using (15b).
Next, loop forward on the human capital technology (3) for given h0 and {e j }Jj=0 to compute
an update of hJ denoted by hnJ . Compute the present discounted value of consumption, PVC,
and, using the already computed values {hnj }Jj=0 , compute the present discounted value of income, PV I. Use the relationship
PV I
cn0 = c0 ·
(27)
PVC
to form an update of initial consumption, cn0 , and next use the Euler equations for consumption
to form an update of cJ , denoted as cnJ . Define the distance functions
g1 (cJ , hJ ) = cJ − cnJ
g2 (cJ , hJ ) = hJ − hnJ .

(28a)
(28b)

In our search for general equilibrium prices, constraints of the household model are occasionally
binding. Therefore, solution of the system of equations in (28) using Newton based methods,
e.g., Broyden’s method, is instable. We solve this problem by a nested Brent algorithm, that is,
we solve two nested univariate problems, an outer one for cJ and an inner one for hJ .
Check for uniqueness: Observe that our nested Brent algorithm assumes that the functions
in (28) exhibit a unique root. As we adjust starting values [cJ , hJ ] with each outer loop iteration
we thereby consider different points in a variable box of [cJ , hJ ] as starting values. For all of
these combinations our procedure always converged. To systematically check whether we also
always converge to the unique optimum, we fix, after convergence of the household problem, a
large box around the previously computed [cJ , hJ ]. Precisely, we choose as boundaries for this
box ±50% of the solutions in the respective dimensions. For these alternative starting values
we then check whether there is an additional solution to the system of equations (28). We never
detected any such multiplicities.
A.2 The Aggregate Model
To solve the open economy general equilibrium transition path we proceed as follows: for a
given r × 1 vector ⃗Ψ of structural model parameters, we first solve for an “artificial” initial
steady state in period t = 0 which gives initial distributions of assets and human capital. We
thereby presume that households assume prices to remain constant for all periods t ∈ {0, . . . , T }
and are then surprised by the actual price changes induced by the transitional dynamics. Next,
we solve for the final steady state of our model which is reached in period T and supported by
33

our demographic projections. In the sequel, the superscripts c and o refer to the closed or open
economy and M denotes the number of regions.
For the closed economy steady state, for each region j we solve[ for the equilibrium
of the
]′
c
c
⃗
aggregate model by iterating on the m ×1 steady state vector Pss, j = p1, j , . . . , pmc , j . p1, j is the
capital intensity, p2, j are transfers (as a fraction of wages), p3, j are social security contribution
(or replacement) rates and p4, j is the average human capital stock for region j. We perform this
procedure separately for both world regions.
To compute the open economy steady state we solve for
of the aggregate
[ the equilibrium
]′
o
o
⃗
model by iterating on the m × 1 steady state vector Pss = p1 , . . . , pmo , j where the number of
variables is given by mo = M(mc − 1) + 1. p1 is the common (world) capital intensity, p2, j are
transfers (as a fraction of wages), p3, j are social security contribution (or replacement) rates and
p4, j is the average human capital stock for region j. Notice that all elements of ⃗Pssc and ⃗Psso are
constant in the steady state.
Solution for the steady states for each closed region j (where we drop the region index for
brevity) of the model involves the following steps:
c,q
1. In iteration q for a guess of ⃗Pss solve the household problem.
2. Update variables in ⃗Pssc as follows:

(a) Aggregate across households to get aggregate assets and aggregate labor supply to
form an update of the capital intensity, pn1 .
(b) Calculate an update of bequests to get pn2 .
(c) Using the update of labor supply, update social security contribution (or replacement)
rates to get pn3 .
(d) Use labor supply and human capital decisions to form an update of the average human
capital stock, pn4 .
3. Collect the updated variables in ⃗Pssc,n and notice that ⃗Pssc,n = H(⃗Pssc ) where H is a vectorvalued non-linear function.
4. Define the root-finding problem G(⃗Pssc ) = ⃗Pssc − H(⃗Pssc ) and iterate on ⃗Pssc until convergence.
We use Broyden’s method to solve the problem and denote the final approximate Jacobi
matrix by Bss .
Solution for the steady states of the open economy of the model involves the following steps:
o,q
1. In iteration q for a guess of ⃗Pss solve the household problem.
2. Update variables in ⃗Psso as follows:

(a) Use the guess for the global capital intensity to compute the capital stock for region
j compatible with the open economy, perfect competition setup. Use this aggregate
capital stock with the aggregate labor supply to form an update of the global capital
intensity, pn1 .
(b) Calculate an update of bequests to get pn2, j ∀ j.
(c) Using the update of labor supply, update social security contribution (or replacement)
rates to get pn3, j ∀ j.
(d) Use labor supply and human capital decisions to form an update of the average human
capital stock, pn4 ∀ j.
34

3. Collect the updated variables in ⃗Psso,n and notice that ⃗Psso,n = H(⃗Psso ) where H is a vectorvalued non-linear function.
4. Define the root-finding problem G(⃗Psso ) = ⃗Psso − H(⃗Psso ) and iterate on ⃗Psso until convergence.
We use Broyden’s method to solve the problem and denote the final approximate Jacobi
matrix by Bss .
Next, we solve for the transitional dynamics for each of the closed economies (where we
again drop the region index j) by the following steps:
1. Use the steady state solutions to form a linear interpolation to get the starting values for
the mc (T − 2) × 1 vector of equilibrium prices, ⃗Pc = [⃗p′1 , . . . ,⃗p′mc ]′ , where pi , i = 1, . . . , mc
are vectors of length (T − 2) × 1.
2. In iteration q for guess ⃗Pc,q solve the household problem. We do so by iterating backwards
in time for t = T − 1, . . . , 2 to get the decision rules and forward for t = 2, . . . , T − 1 for
aggregation.
3. Update variables as in the steady state solutions and denote by ⃗P˜ c = H(⃗Pc ) the
mc (T − 2) × 1 vector of updated variables.
4. Define the root-finding problem as G(⃗Pc ) = ⃗Pc − H(⃗Pc ). Since T is large, this problem
is substantially larger than the steady state root-finding problem and we use the GaussSeidel-Quasi-Newton algorithm suggested in Ludwig (2007) to form and update guesses
of an approximate Jacobi matrix of the system of mc (T − 2) non-linear equations. We
initialize these loops by using a scaled up version of Bss .
We then solve for the transitional dynamics for the open economy setup by the following
steps:
1. Use the equilibrium transition solutions from the closed economies to get the starting
values for the mo (T − t˜ − 2) × 1 vector of equilibrium prices, ⃗Po = [⃗p′1 , . . . ,⃗p′mo ]′ , where
pi , i = 1, . . . , mo are vectors of length (T − t˜ − 2) × 1 where t˜ is the year of opening up.
2. In iteration q for guess ⃗Po,q solve the household problem. We do so by iterating backwards
in time for t = T − t˜ − 1, . . . , 2 to get the decision rules and forward for t = 2, . . . , T − t˜ − 1
for aggregation. For agents already living in year t˜ we use their holdings of physical assets
and human capital from year t˜ as state variables and solve their household problem only
for their remaining lifetime.
3. We then proceed as in the case for the closed economies (updating) but define the rootfinding problem now for the open economy as G(⃗Po ) = ⃗Po − H(⃗Po ) which we solve by the
same method as above.

B.2 Simple Model: Reallocation of Time over the Life Cycle
We want to understand theoretically the effects on labor supply and human capital at the intensive and extensive margin. We further decompose household’s reaction when we keep prices
and policy instruments fixed — i.e., wages, interest rates, the contribution rate and pension
payments — and when we allow for general equilibrium feedback.
To understand the mechanisms theoretically, consider a simplified two-period version of the
model used in the quantitative part. Households maximize utility
U = ϕ ln(c1 ) + (1 − ϕ ) ln (1 − ℓ1 ) + β (ϕ ln(c2 ) + (1 − ϕ )1 ln(1 − ℓ2 ))

with standard notation. h(e) ≥ 1 is a strictly concave human capital production function where
e is time investment which has to be made in the first period. 1 is an indicator function taking
on the value of 1 if the agent is working in the last (second) period and 0 if he is retired and
receives a pension p. Hence, changing the value of the indicator function from 0 to 1 mimics
the pension reform of the quantitative model in a consistent way. Without loss of generality we
normalize w1 = 1. Denote first-period labor supply in the benchmark model — where 1 = 0 —

by ℓBM
1 and labor supply with the higher retirement age — where 1 = 1 — by ℓ1 . Then, the
difference in labor supply after increasing the retirement age is

that allowing for endogenous human capital increases h(e

when the retirement age increases.
