TAs Like Me: Racial Interactions between Graduate Teaching Assistants and Undergraduates
Lester Lusher, Doug Campbell, and Scott Carrell
NBER Working Paper No. 21568
September 2015
JEL No. I2,I23
ABSTRACT
Over the past 40 years, higher education institutions in the U.S. have experienced a dramatic shift
in the racial composition of students enrolled in both undergraduate and graduate programs. Using
administrative data from a large, diverse university in California, we identify the extent to which the
academic outcomes of undergraduates are affected by the race/ethnicity of their graduate student teaching
assistants (TAs). To overcome selection issues in course taking, we exploit the timing of TA assignments,
which occur after students enroll in a course, and we estimate models with both class and student fixed
effects. Results show a positive and significant increase in course grades when students are assigned
TAs of a similar race/ethnicity. These effects are largest in classes where TAs are given advanced
copies of exams and when exams had no multiple choice questions. We also find that assignment to
similar race TAs positively affect both section and office hour attendance, suggesting that TA-student
match quality and role model effects are the primary drivers of the results.

Introduction

From 1995 to 2012, the United States has steadily fallen relative to other developed countries
in college completion rates. Over this short period of time, the US went from having the
highest young-adult college completion rate among OECD countries to nineteenth.1 Especially alarming is the fact that US college completion rates have stagnated despite increases
in overall college attendance (Turner, 2004; Pew Research Center 2014) and large increases
in the returns to a college education in the US (e.g. Goldin and Katz, 2009). Educational
mobility in the US also trails the majority of other OECD countries. For example, in the
US approximately 29% of men and 17% of women have less education than their parents,
compared to the OECD averages of 19% and 13% of men and women, respectively.2 Underlining these college completion rates are prominent racial gaps (Fry, 2002; Arcidiacono
et al., 2011). In 2009, over 50% of Asian adults aged 25 and older held a bachelor’s degree or
higher compared to less than 20% of African-Americans and Hispanics (Current Population
Survey 2009). Such differences in postsecondary educational attainment could lead to persistent income inequality across racial groups (Altonji and Blank, 1999; Card, 1999; Jencks
and Phillips, 1998).
A natural question to ask is, once students enter college, what factors determine the
likelihood they succeed and graduate? Several prior studies have presented causal evidence on
various university inputs that influence undergraduate success, including capacity constraints
and resources (Bound et al., 2010; Bound et al., 2012), professor quality, gender, and race
(Hoffmann and Oreopoulos, 2009b; Carrell and West, 2010; Hoffmann and Oreopoulos,
2009a; Carrell et al., 2010; Fairlie et al., 2014), coaching and advising (Bettinger and Baker,
2014; Angrist et al., 2009), and academic probation (Lindo et al., 2010).
One glaring omission from this literature centers on teaching assistants (TAs), who account for nearly 15% of the total employment of postsecondary teachers in the US annually

(Bureau of Labor Statistics, OES). TAs are graduate students employed by a university who
perform various duties in the course while under the supervision of a professor or lecturer.
Many of these duties likely impact student success in the course, including: 1) hosting small
weekly discussion sections; 2) holding office hours; 3) tutoring; 4) proctoring exams; 5) grading assignments and exams; and 6) arranging other meetings with students. TA-student
relationships are unique in that they are more likely to be a peer-based interaction, since
the typical age gap between undergraduates and TAs is relatively small.3 Additionally, with
class sizes and student-professor ratios increasing in the US (Cuseo, 2007; Kokkelenberg et
al., 2008; Schanzenbach, 2014), TAs are likely to play an increasingly important role in the
US post-secondary education system.
In this paper, we begin to shed light on the importance of TAs in the education production
process. To do so, we focus on the role of TA race. Understanding how TA race influences
student outcomes is particularly important given recent trends in the US. For the past 40
years, undergraduate and graduate programs have been experiencing a dramatic shift in
student racial composition. In 1976, 82% of students enrolled in undergraduate programs in
the US were White, compared to only 57% in 2013. A similar pattern can be observed in
post-baccalaureate programs, where the fraction of non-White students grew by 180% from
1976 to 2013 (NCES 2014).
Why might students be influenced by TA race? Role model effects are often mentioned
as an important determinant affecting educational outcomes. Another factor might include
racial differences in the academic expectation of the student. Research from psychology and
sociology suggests that equally skilled students of different races may perform differently due
to the students’ self-belief about their ability to succeed, and these gaps may be muted (or
exacerbated) by the TA’s race (Spencer et al., 1999). Another channel is a match quality
effect, where TAs of different races may have, on average, particular teaching styles or
3

Several studies have focused on the potential benefits of peer-based mentoring and tutoring. For example,
Castleman and Page (2014) find that near-aged peer mentors in college who sent text messages during the
summer to college-intending high school graduates substantially increased subsequent college enrollment.

capabilities which are better suited to students of similar race.4 Finally, TAs may exhibit
bias with respect to how they treat, consciously or subconsciously, students of a similar race.
Several studies have investigated the importance of race and gender interactions between
students and their teachers. A majority of these studies are at the primary and secondary
school levels, and show mixed evidence of such interactions (e.g. Ehrenberg et al., 1995;
Nixon and Robinson, 1999; Lahelma, 2000; Saft and Pianta, 2001; Dee, 2004; Dee, 2005;
Dee, 2007; Carrington et al., 2005; Carrington et al., 2008; Holmlund and Sund, 2008; Lavy
and Schlosser, 2011; Winters et al., 2013). Fewer studies have evaluated teacher-student
interactions at the postsecondary level, with a majority of studies focusing on professor
gender. Results from early studies found mixed results, though these studies likely suffer
from potential selection biases (e.g. Rothstein, 1994; Canes and Rosen, 1995; Neumark
and Gardecki, 1998). More recent studies, which have exploited within class and within
student variation to overcome selection issues have found positive same-gender effects on
course grades, choice of major, course credits, and course dropping (Bettinger and Long
(2005); Hoffmann and Oreopoulos (2009a); Hoffmann and Oreopoulos (2009b)). Likewise,
using random assignment to courses Carrell et al. (2010) find that professor gender has a
significant impact on female students’ performance in STEM courses. Finally, most closely
related to our study, Fairlie et al. (2014) focus on student-instructor race interactions at the
community college level and find that race interactions play a large role in student outcomes.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the importance of TA-student race
interactions.5 Our primary analyses come from detailed student administrative data from
a public university in California, coupled with TA assignment data from the university’s
Department of Economics. The institution we study is large and racially-diverse. In 2014,
of the over 34,000 students enrolled, 39% were Asian or Pacific Islander, 19% were Hispanic,
4

This channel includes language matching where all else equal, a student learns more if particular material
can be taught in the student’s native language, and students who share the same race as their TAs are more
likely to share the same native language.
5
One exception is a study by Borjas (2000) who examined selection into course sections with foreign-born
TAs across three introductory economics courses.

and 29% were White. Our data also include a survey that was offered to all professors who
taught an economics class during the period of our study, which asked about exam structure
(multiple choice vs. essay) and whether exams were shared with TAs prior to the exam date.
Lastly, our data include an audit study conducted during the 2014-15 school year, which
recorded student attendance during optional TA discussion sections and office hours.
We consider several empirical strategies to causally identify the effects of TA-student
racial interactions and to overcome concerns of potential selection bias. Our primary analyses
focus on models with class fixed effects, where we estimate differences in outcome variables
between students across different races when assigned to the same TAs within the same
class.6 Since the explanatory variable varies both within class, across students, and within
student, across classes, the data also allow us to control for sorting that occurs across classes
by simultaneously including student fixed effects and class fixed effects. This two-way fixed
effect specification helps mitigate potential omitted variables bias. Still, a selection bias
would arise in our setting if, for example, high ability students of particular races systemically
enroll in classes with TAs of the same races. We find no evidence of endogenous sorting into
classes by student race when predicting the race of the class’ TAs with a full set of controls,
including professor race and gender, student gender, high school GPA, age, class standing,
and major. The lack of evidence of endogenous sorting is unsurprising since undergraduates
in our setting have very little ability to identify which classes TAs are assigned to prior
to enrolling in the class. Furthermore, the primary registration period for undergraduates
occurs before TAs assignments are made by the economics department.7
We find that students perform better in classes taken with TAs who are of a similar
race. We predict a 7.7% of a standard deviation increase in course grade for students who
are assigned to TAs of similar race, relative to being assigned to TAs of dissimilar race.
6

We define class as a combination of a course (e.g. Introductory Microeconomics), term (e.g. Fall 2010),
and lecture. For popular courses, several lectures may be offered within the same term such that each lecture
constitutes a different class. TAs are assigned to a single class within a term.
7
While undergraduates still have the ability to register for courses after the end of the primary registration
period, the majority of classes fill up by the time this period is over, leaving little capacity for students to
be selective with their courses.

4

This result is robust across various specifications, racial categorizations, and subsamples.
Race interactions have no impact on course withdrawal rates or likelihood of enrolling in
subsequent courses in the same field.
Finally, we use the audit study and professor survey to offer evidence of the mechanisms
driving the results. Identification of potential mechanisms is largely missing in the previous
literature on racial interactions. Results show that students are more likely to attend their
TAs’ optional discussion sections and office hours when the TA is of a similar race, providing
direct evidence of students responding to similarly-raced TAs. We also see that racial interaction effects are especially prominent in classes where TAs had been given a copy of the
exam prior to the exam date. We interpret this result as evidence of “teaching to the exam”,
where TAs divulge information that is pertinent to the class’ exams if given the opportunity.
Students who are more likely to interact with the TAs by attending the TAs’ discussion sections and office hours are the beneficiaries of teaching to the test. Lastly, racial interaction
effects are strongest in classes which had no multiple choice on the exams. This result could
stem from several possible explanations. First, critical thinking is typically a key component
to success on essay-based questions, and critical thinking skills may be fostered in settings
where students discuss and ask questions about the course material, such as in TA discussion sections and office hours. Another explanation suggests that TAs are (subconsciously)
responding to students of similar race through grading. Classes with no multiple choice
exams are classes where TAs have to exercise more subjective judgments when grading, and
students of specific races may be more likely to answer non-multiple choice questions in a
manner which TAs of similar race favor.
The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the data. Section
3 discusses our identification strategies and econometric specifications. Section 4 presents
our results, and section 5 concludes.

Data

2.1

Data Sources and Institutional Background

Our paper centers on detailed student administrative data from a large, public university
in California with a highly diversified student community. In 2014, over 34,000 students
enrolled at the university, where 39% of the enrolled students were Asian or Pacific Islander,
19% were Hispanic, and 29% were White. U.S. News & World Report (2015) classifies
the university admissions as “most selective” and ranks the university as one of the best
public university in the United States. Our primary analyses link the student administrative
data to graduate teaching assistant (TA) assignment data from the university’s economics
department. The B.A. in Economics is the second largest major at the university, accounting
for over 6% of degrees conferred annually. These data cover the academic school years from
2003 to 2011 for the three primary quarters of enrollment: Fall, Winter, and Spring.8
Each observation in our data set pertains to a student who enrolls in a class. We define
a class as a combination of a course (e.g. ECN100), a term (e.g. Fall 2010), and a lecture.
For popular courses, multiple lectures are often offered within the same term, with different
TAs assigned to each lecture (and quite often, different professors). We have a series of
student-level characteristics, including term admitted, major(s), admission basis (freshman
vs. transfer), gender, race, nationality, parental education, and high school GPA. Student-byterm level variables include academic standing (Freshman/Sophomore/Junior/Senior) and
age. Finally, class-level controls include professor gender and race. We match each student
by class observation to TAs assigned to the class. Since a single class may contain up to
three TAs, we do not necessarily analyze one-to-one matches between a student and a TA.9
Consequently, as described in further detail in section 3, we link the race of a student enrolled
in a class to the racial composition of the TAs assigned to the class.
8

Hence, we do not focus on any special quarters, such as summer sessions.
In economics courses, a student is technically assigned to a single TA, but often has the liberty to choose
any of the TAs in their class to attend discussion sections, visit office hours, etc. Furthermore, it is the joint
responsibility of all TAs within a class to assist with lectures, grade assignments and exams, etc.

Lastly, our paper utilizes two supplemental sets of data. First, in the Fall of 2014, we
administered a survey that was offered to all professors who taught a class during our 2003 to
2011 time frame. For each class a professor taught, the survey recorded whether the professor
shared a copy of the class’ exams with the TAs prior to the exam date and the structure of
the exams (multiple choice vs. short/long answer). Approximately 58% of our total studentby-class observations are covered by professor survey responses. Secondly, in the Spring 2015
quarter, we conducted an audit study where student attendance by gender and race at TA
discussion sections and office hours was recorded by an undergraduate research assistant who
audited the class. TA discussion sections and office hours are hosted weekly throughout the
quarter, and attendance in our setting is optional for enrolled students. Auditors visited the
TA discussion sections during the third and fourth weeks of the term and the office hours
during the fifth and sixth weeks. The audit study covers 124 discussion sections and 102
office hours.
2.2

Summary Statistics

The main part of our analysis focuses on two outcome variables at the student-by-class level:
whether the student withdrew from the class (“Dropped Class”) and the grade received in
the class, conditional on completing the course (“Standardized Grade”). We define a student
as dropping the class if the student did not receive a letter grade (A through F with +/modifiers), an “Incomplete” grade, or a “(No) Pass” grade in the class. “Dropped Class”
is a binary variable. In order to account for differences in difficulty or grading standards
across courses and terms, “Standardized Grade” is standardized to have a mean of zero and
a standard deviation of one by class. Other outcomes we save for the appendix include
indicators for whether the student passed the class and whether the student enrolled in a
class in the same subject in a subsequent term. Table 1 presents summary statistics for
our main sample of interest. We have 60,642 student-by-class observations, 19,522 students,
614 classes, and 286 teaching assistants. We define a student or a TA as of Asian race if
their primary race is recorded as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filippino, South-East Asian,
7

Vietnamese, Thai, or “Other Asian”.

Econometric Specifications

Our first specification estimates the impact of TA race for Asian and non-Asian student
subsamples separately, using the following specification:

yikt = γSameRaceT Aikt + βXikt + λk + αt + uikt

(1)

where yikt is an outcome for student i taking course k in school term t, Xikt is a vector
of student by class controls, λk and αt are fixed effects for course and term, respectively,
and uikt is the error term. SameRaceT Aikt is the fraction of student i’s TAs for course
k in school term t that are of similar race to the student. In other words, if student i is
(non-)Asian, then SameRaceT Aikt is the fraction of the student’s TAs in course k and term
t that are (non-)Asian. Since the number of TAs assigned to a class ranges from one to
three, SameRaceT Aikt carries a value of either 0, 31 , 12 , 23 , or 1. The estimated γ coefficients
measure the average effect from taking a class in which all TAs are of a similar race versus
all TAs of a different race, and captures both the racial interaction effect and a TA quality
effect (if Asian TAs teach differently than non-Asian TAs, for example). The summation
of the γ coefficients for the subsamples captures the interaction effect of a student being of
similar race as their TAs (see Appendix).
The data also allow us to run the following specification, using class fixed effects:

yikt = ψ(Ai ∗ AsianT Aikt ) + βXit + λkt + αkA + δtA + uikt

(2)

where yikt is a class-specific outcome for student i, Ai is an indicator variable for whether
student i is Asian, AsianT Aikt is the Asian composition of student i’s TAs for class kt, Xit
is a vector of student by term controls, and λkt , αkA , and δtA are class, course by race, and
term by race fixed effects, respectively. Class fixed effects control for unobserved factors that

8

vary at the class level and affect student performance. Note that class fixed effects control
for professor fixed effects since each class is taught by exactly one professor. These, in turn,
control for the possibility that students of a particular race take classes with professors who
are systematically different from other professors. Class fixed effects also avoid the need to
rely on settings with standardized grading or testing procedures across classes since students
within a class are completing the exact same assignments and tests. Thus, we are solely
comparing the academic performances of Asian and non-Asian students within the same
class and subjecting the students to the same class-level shocks, such as the professor’s and
TAs’ characteristics (e.g. ability/experience) or the time of the class. Course by race fixed
effects allow for racial differences in the outcome variable to vary across courses. These are
necessary to account for the possibility that the courses in which non-Asians and Asians
tend to perform differently are also the courses in which TAs tend to be non-Asian or Asian,
respectively.10 Term by race fixed effects account for the possibility that the academic
capabilities of Asian or non-Asian students are changing over time. ψ measures the average
outcome gain for Asian students, relative to non-Asian students, from assignment to Asian
TAs. Conversely, ψ measures the average outcome loss for non-Asian students, relative to
Asian students, from assignment to Asian TAs versus non-Asian TAs.
Finally, to measure student attendance by race to TA discussion sections and office hours
from the audit study, we consider the following specification:

f racStudentAsians = ρAsianT As + βXs + us

(3)

where each observation corresponds to TAs’ discussion sections or office hours. Xs comprises of indicators for the weekday, the time, and the individual auditor for the discussion
section or office hour.11 Observations are weighted by total attendance of students to the
10

For example, Asian students may be more likely to enroll in an international studies course and Asian
TAs may be more likely to be assigned to international studies. Indeed, our estimated magnitude of ψ
slightly increases when we exclude course by race fixed effects (see Appendix Table A.3).

There were 23 separate auditors who attended the discussion sections and office hours.

discussion section or office hour. ρ is the expected increase in the fraction of attendees who
are Asian in response to the discussion section or office hour being hosted by an Asian TA.
3.1

Identification

The primary threat to our identification strategy is potential selection into courses by TA
race, which could result in a correlation between the error term uikt and the interaction
term Ai ∗ AsianT Aikt from specification (2). For example, our estimates would be biased
if high ability Asian students systemically select into classes assigned Asian TAs and high
ability non-Asian students systematically select into classes assigned non-Asian TAs. Prior
work looking at professor-student relationships often suffer from such selection biases, where
students of a particular gender/race, and different academic capabilities, select into classes
based on the teacher gender/race.12 To mitigate selection biases, previous studies often chose
to focus on a sample of students or classes where selection was arguably not an issue.13 In
our setting, it is nearly impossible for undergraduates to identify which TAs are assigned to
which classes prior to enrolling in a class. Furthermore, the primary registration period for
undergraduates occurs before the department even generates TA assignments for classes.14
While undergraduates (technically) have the ability to register for courses after the end of
the primary registration period, the majority of classes fill up by the time this period is
over, leaving little capacity for students to be selective with their courses. As a robustness
check, we replace student-level controls in Xit with student fixed effects to control for any
absolute sorting that takes place if, for instance, students taking classes with Asian TAs are
systematically different from those who do not, irrespective of the student’s race. Student
fixed effects also implicitly control for differences in ability by race that exist across all
classes, independent of the TAs’ traits.
12

Perhaps exacerbating selection biases in prior studies are services such as ratemyprofessor.com, which
provide students with extensive information about their instructors.
13
For example, Fairlie et al. (2014) focus on students with relatively low standing on registration priority
lists since these students have little ability to be selective with their courses.
14
For example, for the Spring 2014 term, which started in March, the primary undergraduate registration
period started on February 3 and ended on February 14. The department of economics generated and
privately revealed TA assignments on February 27 to TAs and professors.

10

We can formally test for endogenous enrollment by race since we have observables Xikt
that are correlated with uikt . In Table 2, we regress AsianT Aikt on observable characteristics
and term and course fixed effects. The first column presents results from our main sample of
interest, while the next two columns consider Asian and non-Asian student subsamples. The
final three columns are laid out in a similar fashion, except they consider the subsample of
classes taught by professors who completed the survey. Our regressors are generally small and
weak predictors of Asian TA composition, and the race of the student is a very weak predictor
of the racial composition of the TAs. For each regression, we test the hypothesis that all
covariates are jointly equal to zero, conditional on term and course fixed effects, and report
the p-values. Across all samples, we fail to reject the hypothesis that all covariates have no
power in predicting TA race.15 Results from this analysis, coupled with practical knowledge
of the selection process for students into classes, indicate that our primary regressor of
interest suffers little to no endogeneity bias.

Results

4.1

Main Results

Table 3 presents our main results. The first two rows from Table 3 report estimates for γ
from specification (1), where we regress our outcome variables on the fraction of TAs who are
Asian and non-Asian for Asian and non-Asian student subsamples, respectively. Focusing
on the first column, which includes term and course fixed effects, Asian students are about
0.2 percentage points more likely to drop the course when the racial composition of the TAs
is entirely Asian, relative to being entirely non-Asian. Non-Asian students are about 0.1
percentage points more likely to drop the course when the class contains all non-Asian TAs.
Both of these estimates are small and statistically insignificant. The summation of these
two estimates is the expected relative effect between Asian and non-Asian students when
15

We also consider the “sorting regressions” of Fairlie et al. (2014) in Appendix Table A.1, and find no
evidence of endogenous sorting. The primary benefit of the Fairlie et al. (2014) specification is the ability
to conditionalize on class fixed effects. A drawback is that one cannot simultaneously test the importance
of observables Xikt in predicting TA race.

11

the student has all Asian TAs instead of all non-Asian TAs. In order to test whether this
summation is significant, we ran specification (1) with Asian TA composition on the entire
sample while allowing for Asian-specific coefficients for each regressor. Standard errors are
clustered by professor for all specifications.16 An estimate next to “Effect of Similar Race”
reports the coefficient from the Asian TA composition variable interacted with an Asian
student dummy variable and is equivalent to the summation of the coefficients on the TA
racial composition variable from the separate regressions of Asian and non-Asian student
subsamples. The second column for each outcome variable includes a full set of controls,
while the third column replaces course and term fixed effects with class fixed effects. The
final column for each outcome variable replaces student-level controls with student fixed
effects. Panel B presents the results for classes where the professor responded to our survey.
We find no evidence across all specifications that Asian and non-Asian students differ in
their choice to drop a course based on the racial composition of the class’ TAs.
Table 3 also suggests that students receive significantly higher grades in response to
being assigned TAs of similar race. Interpreting from column (5), we see that Asian students
receive a 2.3% of a standard deviation increase in course grade when the racial composition
of the TAs is entirely Asian. Similarly, non-Asian students see a 3.7% of a standard deviation
increase in course grade when enrolled in a class with all non-Asian TAs. The summation
of these two estimates is statistically significant, suggesting that students perform better
when taking a class with TAs who are of a similar race as themselves. From our model with
both class and student fixed effects, we predict a statistically significant 7.7% of a standard
deviation increase in course grade when students are matched to TAs who are all of a similar
race as themselves.17
16

With fewer professor clusters than class clusters, we conservatively cluster at the professor level instead
of the class level. Ideally, we would cluster at the TA level, but since a single class may contain up to three
TAs, a single observation may belong to up to three TA clusters. There are fewer professors than TAs in our
setting. As a robustness check, we consider the subsample of classes which had only one TA and cluster at
the TA level. Both estimated magnitudes and standard errors slightly increase, with the results remaining
largely statistically significant (see Appendix Table A.3, Panel C). The standard errors decrease when we
cluster at the class level instead of professor level.
17
When the data are parsed by White and non-White students and TAs, this coefficient drops slightly to

4.2

Mechanisms

An important question to address for welfare and policy implications centers on the mechanisms that are driving our results. TA race could influence student outcomes in several
manners. Role model effects are often mentioned as a determinant affecting educational outcomes, where in our setting, students may be inspired by their TAs, or be more comfortable
approaching and learning from their TAs, due to the TA sharing a similar race. Another channel is a match quality effect, where TAs of different race/ethnicity have particular teaching
styles which are better suited to students of similar race/ethnicity. Included in this channel
is a language matching effect, where students learn more if course material can be explained
in the student’s native language, and students who share the same race/ethnicity as their
TAs are more likely to share a native language. Thus, with a match quality effect, students
and TAs are not directly responding to the other’s race, but instead students are reacting to
a characteristic that is, on average, associated with their TAs’ race/ethnicity. Finally, TAs
could exhibit bias with respect to how they treat students of a similar race. Discrimination
could happen on a subconscious level as well where, for example, TAs of particular races
may be more lenient when grading certain types of errors on exams that are more likely
to be made by students of similar race. The consequences of each of the three channels
provide us with testable hypotheses in order to separately identify the mechanisms behind
our results. While we cannot rule out a discrimination effect, the body of evidence presented
below suggests that match quality effects and role model effects are the primary drivers for
our results.
To start, we test for student response to TA race in the form of student attendance to
TA discussion sections and office hours in a setting where attendance is completely optional.
Results from specification (3) for the audit study are presented in Table 4. Across all
specifications and in both discussion sections and office hours, we find that TA race is
0.076 standard deviations, and maintains statistical significance at the 1% level (see Appendix Table A.5).
Racial interactions remain statistically significant when we consider specifications (1) and (2) with finer race
categorizations (see Appendix Table A.6 and Table A.7).

positively related to the race of the attending students. From column (3), we predict an 8.4
percentage point increase in the fraction of attending students who are Asian in response
to the discussion section being taught by an Asian TA. For office hours, we estimate a 20
percentage point increase in fraction of Asian attendees in response to the office hour being
hosted by an Asian TA.18 These results provide evidence of students directly responding to
TAs of similar race. Furthermore, the underlying motive for the students’ attendance may
be driven by a match quality effect, where a student is learning more from their TAs due to
the TAs’ teaching styles or capabilities.
Table 5 presents results from the professor survey. We first see that in classes with no
multiple choice exams, Asian students see boosts in their grades in response to Asian TAs,
while non-Asian students see their grades rise when assigned non-Asian TAs. The estimated
racial interaction effect in classes with no multiple choice is 0.217 for the specification with
both student and class fixed effects. We observe smaller, statistically insignificant interaction
effects when focusing on classes that had exams with multiple choice. One could interpret
this finding as suggestive evidence of match-quality effect, where classes with no multiple
choice exams may proxy for classes where critical thinking is a key component to student
success, and critical thinking skills may be fostered in settings where students discuss and
ask questions about the course material, such as in TA discussion sections and office hours.
Another explanation, suggesting discrimination, stems from TA grading behavior. Classes
with no multiple choice exams likely results in TAs having to exercise more subjective judgments when grading. Students of specific races may be more likely to answer non-multiple
choice questions in a manner which TAs of a similar race favor. For example, an essay from
an Asian student may be written in a style that is graded more favorably by an Asian TA
relative to a non-Asian TA.19
18

The total number of (non-)Asian students who attend discussion sections increases when the TA is (non-)
Asian. On the other hand, the total number of office hour attendees decreases, irrespective of student race,
in response to office hours being hosted by an Asian TA; the decrease in Asian student attendees is smaller
than the decrease from non-Asian student attendees.
19
This latter example would need to simultaneously apply to both Asian and non-Asian students, since
both Asian and non-Asian students see boosts in their grades when matched to TAs of similar race while

14

Table 5 also suggests that the observed racial interaction effects are especially driven by
classes where TAs were given advanced copies of the exam. From column (6), we predict
an 11.6% of a standard deviation increase in course grade for Asian students when taking a
class with all Asian TAs versus non-Asian TAs. Similarly, non-Asian students see a boost of
3.9% of a standard deviation in course grade in response to taking a class with all non-Asian
TAs instead of Asian TAs. Estimated racial interaction effects are statistically significant
at the 10% level across all considered specifications. We interpret these results as further
reinforcement of a role model effect and TA-student match quality effect. When a TA is
given a copy of the exam, the TA has the ability to “teach to the test” by adjusting his/her
discussion section and office hour lessons to better suit the material that will appear on the
exam. Teaching to the test would benefit students who attend discussion sections and office
hours, and as evidenced from the audit study, attending students tend to be of similar race
as the TA.20

Conclusions

In spite of increases in overall attendance, college completion rates have stagnated in the
US. A natural question to ask is, once the student enters college, what factors determine
student success? The goal of this paper is to shed light on the importance of TAs in the
education production process, focusing on the role of TA race. Understanding how TA race
influences student outcomes is particularly important given recent trends in the US, where
the fraction of non-White undergraduate and graduate students has nearly tripled over the
past 40 years. Prominent racial gaps, in turn, lead to persistent income inequality across
racial groups.
Our primary analyses come from detailed student administrative data from a public,
diverse undergraduate university in California. We consider several empirical strategies to
overcome concerns of potential selection bias. We first focus on models with class fixed effects,
taking a class with no multiple choice exams.
20
The racial interaction effect is strongest in classes that had both shared exams with TAs and no multiple
choice (see Appendix Table A.4).

15

where we compare differences in outcomes between students across different races when
assigned to the same TAs within the same class. Furthermore, we simultaneously control
for sorting that occurs across classes by including student fixed effects. While selection bias
could still arise from this two-way fixed effect specification, we find no evidence of endogenous
sorting into classes by student race when predicting the race of the class’ TAs with a full
set of controls. The lack of sorting is unsurprising since students have very little ability
identifying which classes TAs are assigned to, and TA assignments are generated after the
undergraduates’ primary registration period ends.
We find that students perform better when taking a class with TAs who are of a similar
race. Race interactions have no impact on course withdrawal rates or likelihood of enrolling
in subsequent courses in the same field. Students are more likely to attend their TA’s optional
office hours and discussion sections when the TA is of a similar race. Racial interactions are
strongest in classes where TAs had been given a copy of the exam prior to the exam date,
and when the exams for the class had no multiple choice. The body of evidence suggests that
role model effects and match quality effects between TAs and their students play noticeable
roles in determining student success.

Notes: Each cell reports the coefficient for similar race graduate TA composition, or in the case of “Effect of Similar
Race”, Asian graduate TA composition interacted with an Asian student dummy. Standardized grade has a mean
of zero and a standard deviation of one by class. Controls include age when class began, high school GPA, and
admission year, as well as indicators for student gender, international vs. domestic, whether parents attended college,
admittance (transfer vs. freshman), whether the student is majoring in the subject of the course, double major,
class standing (Freshman/Sophomore/Junior/Senior), and professor gender and race. All “Effect of Similar Race”
specifications include course by race and term by race fixed effects. Standard errors in parentheses, clustered by
professor. One, two, and three asterisks indicate statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels, respectively.

Results Appendix
Claim: summation of γ coefficients from subsample regressions of equation (1) produces
racial interaction effect. Consider the following three regressions:
For Asian students:

yikt = γ1 AsianT Aikt + βXikt + λk + αt + uikt

(4)

For non-Asian students:

yikt = γ2 AsianT Aikt + βXikt + λk + αt + uikt

(5)

For non-Asian students:

yikt = γ3 nonAsianT Aikt + βXikt + λk + αt + uikt

(6)

γ1 captures both the racial interaction effect and an overall TA quality effect (if, for example,
Asian TAs teach differently than non-Asian TAs, on average). The difference between γ1 and
γ2 is the relative racial difference predicted from assignment to a class with all Asian TAs,
and thus captures the interaction effect of a student being of similar race as their TAs. Note
that γ3 = −γ2 . Hence, the summation of γ1 and γ3 captures the racial interaction effect.
Thus, the summation of the γ coefficients for the subsamples from equation (1) produces the
racial interaction effect.

Notes: Each cell displays results from a regression of the race-specific average student outcomes in a
classroom on an indicator for whether the average is associated with Asian students, the fraction of the TAs
assigned to the class who are Asian, the interaction between these two variables, and class fixed effects. This
table reports the coefficient on the interaction term, which can be interpreted as the extent to which Asian
students sort into classes assigned Asian TAs. Outcomes for each regression vary across columns. Rows
are defined by the subsample of students we consider. Students and TAs are classified as Asian if their
primary race is recorded as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filippino, South-East Asian, Vietnamese, Thai,
or “Other Asian”. Standard errors in parentheses, clustered by professor. One, two, and three asterisks
indicate statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels, respectively.

Notes: Each cell reports the coefficient for similar race graduate TA composition, or in the case of “Effect of Similar
Race”, Asian graduate TA composition interacted with an Asian student dummy. Both outcome variables are indicators,
one for whether the student passed the class and another for whether the student (Freshman or Sophomore) took another
class in the same field in a subsequent term. Controls include age when class began, high school GPA, and admission
year, as well as indicators for student gender, international vs. domestic, whether parents attended college, admittance
(transfer vs. freshman), whether the student is majoring in the subject of the course, double major, class standing (Freshman/Sophomore/Junior/Senior), and professor gender and race. All “Effect of Similar Race” specifications include course
by race and term by race fixed effects. Standard errors in parentheses, clustered by professor. One, two, and three asterisks

Notes: Each cell reports the coefficient on the interaction between a student identifier for Asian and fraction of TAs
Asian. The first column reports estimates for the subsample of classes where professors gave a response to whether
they shared the exam with the TAs and what fraction of their class’ exams were multiple choice. The remaining
columns consider further survey subsamples. All specifications include course by race fixed effects. Controls include
age when class began, high school GPA, and admission year, as well as indicators for student gender, international
vs. domestic, whether parents attended college, admittance (transfer vs. freshman), whether the student is
majoring in the subject of the course, double major, and class standing (Freshman/Sophomore/Junior/Senior).

Notes: This table displays results from regressions that are run separately for each student race. Each cell reports the coefficient
for TA racial composition. Standardized grade has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. The outcome in Panel
C only considers Freshmen and Sophomores, and switches on for students who took another class in the same field in a
subsequent term. Controls include age when class began, high school GPA, and admission year, as well as indicators for student
gender, international vs. domestic, whether parents attended college, admittance (transfer vs. freshman), whether the student
is majoring in the subject of the course, double major, class standing (Freshman/Sophomore/Junior/Senior), and professor
gender and race. Course and term fixed effects included. Standard errors in parentheses, clustered by professor. One, two, and
three asterisks indicate statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels, respectively.

Notes: This table displays results from outcome regressions in which we allow for interactions between finer student and TA
races. We only show results for our preferred specification, which includes student by term controls and class fixed effects. We
report the full set of nine identified interactions for each regression. Since we include student race controls and class fixed effects,
all interactions involving white students or TAs are unidentified. Same-race interactions are shown in bold. “Take Another
Class” only considers the sample of Freshmen and Sophomores. p-values for an F-test of the existence of same-race interactions
and for the existence of any race interactions are also listed. Standard errors in parentheses, clustered by professor. One, two,
and three asterisks indicate statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels, respectively.
