ABSTRACT
We use an innovative methodology to measure management practices in over 300 manufacturing firms
in the UK. We then match this management data to production and energy usage information for establishments
owned by these firms. We find that establishments in better managed firms are significantly less energy
intensive. They use less energy per unit of output, and also in relation to other factor inputs. This is
quantitatively substantial: going from the 25th to the 75th percentile of management practices is associated
with a 17.4% reduction in energy intensity. This negative relationship is robust to a variety of controls
for industry, location, technology and other factor inputs. Better managed firms are also significantly
more productive. One interpretation of these results is that well managed firms are adopting modern
lean manufacturing practices, which allows them to increase productivity by using energy more efficiently.
This suggests that improving the management practices of manufacturing firms may help to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.

1. Introduction
A growing literature is pointing to differences in management practices as an important factor in
explaining variations in productivity across firms and countries1. In this paper, we examine how the
quality of management relates to the energy intensity of firms, a key driver of the greenhouse gas and
pollution levels. The theoretical relationship between management practices and energy intensity is a
priori ambiguous. On the one hand, better managed firms should be able to reduce energy use through
more efficient production techniques. On the other hand, the higher productivity that good management
involves may also require greater capital utilization, and potentially higher energy usage. In this paper
we assemble the first data set on management practices and energy intensity to investigate this
relationship.
Based on cross country data, it appears that better management practices are associated with greater
energy intensity. Figure 1 plots the CO2 pollution intensity across fifteen countries against the average
quality of management (based on the Bloom and Van Reenen (2007) methodology and described in
section 2 below), showing an apparently positive correlation, suggesting that well managed firms may
pollute more. Particularly notable in this context is the performance of the US being a top ranked in
both managerial quality and energy intensity. Of course a number of other variables, such as the level
of regulation or industrial development, also differ across these countries, which may induce a spurious
correlation between management practices and pollution. Hence, to examine this correlation more
carefully it is important to look across firms within a particular country, thereby holding constant those
common country-wide factors.
In this paper we match firm-level information on management practices to production and energy
usage data from the UK business census for the establishments owned by these firms. The energy
usage data from the census allows us to undertake the first evaluation of the firm level association
between management practices and energy utilization. We find a robust negative correlation between
management practices and energy intensity. In other words, better managed firms are less energy
intensive, which as we discuss in Section 3 is robust to a large number of additional controls. Figure 2
plots this cross firm scatter plot of management practices against energy intensity showing a significant

negative correlation. Hence, this suggests that the positive cross-country correlation between energy
intensity and better management is misleading, as it is driven by spurious correlations with other
factors, such as the level of development. The magnitude of this negative cross-firm management
correlation with energy intensity is quantitatively substantial. Improving management practices from
the 25th to the 75th percentile is associated with a 17.4% reduction in energy intensity.
We also investigate the link between management practices and productivity, finding a strong positive
correlation: improving the quality of management from the 25th to 75th percentile is associated with a
3.7% increase in total-factor productivity. Therefore, overall these results suggest that management
practices that are associated with improved productivity are not linked to worse environmental
performance. Rather, our results are broadly supportive of the idea that well run firms use energy
inputs more efficiently, thereby increasing profitability and productivity, while at the same time
reducing carbon emissions. We also find better managed firms use less materials in their production
process, but more physical capital and more skilled labor.
A question that arises from our results is what could drive the negative correlation between energy
intensity, management and economic performance in our firms? One explanation is that modern
management practices minimize energy use. For example, Lean manufacturing, which is a widely
adopted modern management technology developed by Toyota in the 1960s and 1970s, explicitly tries
to reduce the waste of materials and energy.2 Another explanation is that the factors which induce firms
to improve their management practices – like tougher product market competition or improved
corporate governance – may also induce them to be more energy efficient in order to cut production
costs.
Our results suggest that policies aimed at improving management practices – such as encouraging
competition, reducing labor-market regulations and eliminating tax-incentives for family ownership –
may improve environmental outcomes.3 One example supporting this concept is the staggering energy

2

See, for example, Womack et al. (1990).
Of course the results might equally entail that environmental policies lead targeting firms lead to improvements in
economic performance, for example Berman and Bui (2001) or Shadbegian and Gray (2005) and somewhat contrary,
Greenstone (2002).

inefficiency of the (old) Soviet block factories. These firms did not face product market competition, so
had little incentive to economize on energy use.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we describe the two data sources used
for this study. The third section provides the results and counterfactual analysis, whereas the last
section concludes.

2. Data
The data used for the analysis is drawn from two different sources. The first source is the management
survey conducted by the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics during
the summer of 2006. This includes eighteen questions from which the overall management source is
computed plus additional information on firms’ characteristics and the interview process. The second
source is the Census of Production data from the UK Office of National Statistics, which provides
detailed information on establishments’ production inputs.
2.1 Management Data
Overall, we surveyed almost 6,000 firms across 15 countries. Although in this paper we use only
information on UK firms, in this section we describe the three key steps in collecting informative
management practice data from firms across all countries.

Scoring Management Practices
First, to measure management requires codifying the concept of “good” or “bad” management into a
measure applicable to different firms across the manufacturing sector. This is a challenging task as
good management is difficult to define and is often contingent on a firm’s environment. Our initial
hypothesis was that, while characterizing every managerial practice as “good” or “bad” was extremely
hard, there is a subset of practices that are common across manufacturing firms and for which such a
characterization is informative. Our survey questions focus on such practices, and is built from a
practice evaluation tool developed by a leading international management consultancy firm.
Our survey evaluation tool defines eighteen key management practices used by industrial firms and
scores them from one (worst practice) to five (best practice). In Appendix A (Table A1) we detail these

4

practices and the type of questions we asked in the same order as they appeared in the survey. Bloom
and Van Reenen (2006) gives examples and more details on these practices.
These practices are grouped into four areas: operations (three practices), monitoring (five practices),
targets (five practices) and incentives (five practices). The shop-floor operations section focuses on the
introduction of lean manufacturing techniques, the documentation of processes improvements and the
rationale behind the introduction of such improvements. The monitoring section focuses on the
tracking of performance of individuals, reviewing performance (e.g. through regular appraisals and job
plans), and consequence management (e.g. making sure that plans are kept and appropriate sanctions
and rewards are in place). The targets section examines the type of targets (whether goals are simply
financial or operational or more holistic), the realism of the targets (stretching, unrealistic or nonbinding), the transparency of targets (simple or complex) and the range and interconnection of targets
(e.g. whether they are given consistently throughout the organization). Finally, the incentives section
includes promotion criteria (e.g. purely tenure based or including an element linked to individual
performance), pay and bonuses, and fixing or firing bad performers, where best practice is deemed the
approach that gives strong rewards for those with both ability and effort. A subset of the practices has
similarities with those used in studies on Human Resource Management practices literature such as
Ichniowski, Shaw and Prenushi (1997), Black and Lynch (2001) and Cappelli and Neumark (2001).
In our main econometric specifications we take the unweighted average across the scores as our
primary measure of overall managerial quality. We also experimented with other weighting schemes
based on factor analytic approaches, but none of our results changed in any fundamental way.

Collecting Accurate Responses
A second challenge is to obtain unbiased responses to these questions. The survey instrument was
targeted at plant managers, who are typically senior enough to have an overview of management
practices but not senior enough as to be detached from day-to-day operations of the enterprise. To
obtain accurate information, we used a double-blind survey methodology. This consisted of two steps.
First, the interviews were conducted by telephone without revealing to the managers that they were
being scored. This enabled scoring to be based on the interviewer’s evaluation of the firm’s actual
practices, rather than their aspirations, the manager’s perceptions or the interviewer’s impressions.

5

Interviewers were specifically instructed to use open (i.e. “can you tell me how you promote your
employees?”), rather than closed questions (i.e. “do you promote your employees on tenure
[yes/no]?”). Furthermore, these questions targeted actual practices and examples, with the discussion
continuing until the interviewer could make an accurate assessment of the firm’s typical practices
based on these examples. For each practice, the first question was broad and it was followed by
detailed questions to fine-tune the scoring. For example, regarding the introduction of modern
manufacturing practices, the initial question was: “Can you tell me about your manufacturing process?”
and was followed by the more specific question: “How do you manage your inventory levels?”.
The second step of the double-blind scoring methodology was that the interviewers did not know
anything about the firm’s financial information or performance in advance of the interview. This was
achieved by selecting medium sized manufacturing firms and by providing only firm names and
contact details to the interviewers (but no financial details). These smaller firms (the median size was
275 employees) would not be known by name and are rarely reported in the business media. The
interviewers were specially trained graduate students from top European and U.S. business schools. All
interviews were conducted in English.
Since each interviewer ran 85 interviews, on average, we can remove interviewer fixed effects from all
empirical specifications. This helps to address concerns over inconsistent interpretation of categorical
responses (see Manski, 2004), standardizing the scoring system. As an additional control for any
residual potential survey noise, we collected detailed information on the interview process itself
(number and type of prior contacts before obtaining the interviews, duration, time-of-day, date and dayof-the week), on the manager (gender, seniority, nationality, company and job tenure, internal and
external employment experience and location). We refer to these variables as “noise controls”, since
their inclusion should help us control for measurement error.

Obtaining Interviews with Managers
Each interview took on average forty five minutes and was run during the summers of 2006 to 2008
from the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. Overall, we obtained
a relatively high response rate of 45%, which was achieved through four steps. First, the interview was
introduced as “a piece of work” without discussion of the firm’s financial position or its company

6

accounts, making it relatively uncontroversial for managers to participate. Interviewers did not discuss
financials in the interviews, both to maximize the participation of firms but also to ensure our
interviewers were truly “blind” on the firm’s financial position. Also the fact that the questions were
focused on firm’s managerial practices meant that many managers, besides the plant manager, could be
contacted4. Second, practices were ordered to lead with the least controversial (shop-floor operations
management) and finish with the most controversial (pay, promotions and firings). Third, interviewers’
performance was closely monitored and explicitly incentivised. On the one hand, each team of
interviewers (two or three persons) had a dedicated supervisor, providing on-the-spot training and
advice, but also double-scoring most of the interviews conducted. On the other hand, interviewers’
compensation was per interview conducted and there were also bonus payments on reaching team
goals. These efforts led interviewers to be persistent when chasing any particular firm. Fourth, the
written endorsement of the Governments, Central Banks and Employer Federations across the countries
interviewed helped demonstrate to managers that this was an important exercise with official support.
We focused on medium sized manufacturing firms, randomly selecting firms with between 100 and
5,000 employees. Comparing the responding firms with those in the sampling frame, we found no
evidence that the responders were systematically different on any of the performance measures to the
non-responders. The only exception was on size, where our firms were slightly larger on average than
those in the sampling frame.
The average management scores for the fifteen countries we interviewed are plotted in Figure 1 against
the average level of CO2 produced per capita. The management scores are highest for the US, Canada
and the traditional manufacturing countries like Germany, Japan and Sweden, intermediate for
Northern Europe (UK, France, Italy and Poland) and low for Southern Europe and developing
countries (Portugal, Greece, India, Brazil and China). The ordering for CO2 produced per capita is very
similar, leading to a positive cross-country correlation between management practices and per capita
energy use.

4

We found no significant correlation between the number, type and time-span of contacts before an interview is conducted
and the management score. This suggests while different managers may respond differently to the interview proposition,
this does not appear to be directly correlated with their responses or the average management practices of the firm.

2.2 Census of Production Data
The UK Office of National Statistics (ONS) maintains a register of all businesses in Britain called the
Interdepartmental Business Register (IDBR). On the basis of this register the ONS runs a mandatory
survey of UK businesses, the Annual Business Inquiry (ABI).5 Our firm level production data, the
Annual Respondents Database (ARD), is derived from this survey.6 The ARD focuses mostly on
medium and large firms, whereas smaller businesses with less than 250 employees are not surveyed
every year but included into the sample on a random basis. The ARD sampled plants account for
around 90% of total manufacturing employment in the UK.

Matching the Census of Production data to the Management Survey data
The CEP management survey provides data on 601 plants in Britain. Around 338 of these could be
matched to the census production data. The match is not complete because the system of Company
Register Numbers (CRN), which is the basis for the management survey, is maintained independently
from the businesses registry that the production census is based upon. Although the ONS provides a
lookup table between the two registers, there are a number of firms surveyed on their managerial
practices that could not be matched to the production census. This is typically the case for smaller, less
established firms.
Table B1 in the appendix reports descriptive statistics for the two samples of matched and un-matched
firms. In terms of employment, matched firms have on average about 84 employees more than unmatched firms. They are also slightly older and have a higher management score. To the extent that this
sample selection affects our results, we expect that it would introduce a downward bias by compressing
the range of variation of firm performance (reducing the signal to noise ratio in the data). Appendix B
provides further details of the matching process.
Because of stratified random sampling of smaller firms in the ARD7, we do not have production data
for every firm in every year. Table 1 reports statistics on the firms we can use for productivity and

1999 (first year with energy expenditure data) and 2004 (last available wave of the ARD).
3. Results
Our results are discussed in three parts. First, as a basic check on the data we confirm that our firmlevel management measure is significantly related to establishment level productivity, mirroring the
results of Bloom and Van Reenen (2007). Second, we provide evidence showing that managerial
quality is significantly related to lower levels of energy intensity. In other words, we demonstrate that
the best managed firms are not only more productive, but also more efficient consumers of energy.
Finally, we examine how management is related to the intensity in other production factors.

3.1 Management practices and Productivity
Consider the basic firm production function:

goit = α l lit + α k kit + α in init + α e eit + β M i + γ ' Z it + uit

(1)

where GO = real gross output (sales and inventory changes deflated with a sectoral producer price
index), L = labor, K = capital, IN = deflated expenditure on non-energy intermediate inputs (materials)
and E = deflated energy expenditure of firm i at time t. Lower case letters denote natural logarithms,
e.g. l = ln(L). The matrix Z consists of a number of control variables that affect productivity, such as
workforce characteristics8 (the proportion of workers with a degree and the average hours worked),
firm characteristics (firm age, whether the firm is listed), and a complete set of three digits industry
binary indicators.
The crucial variable for us is management practices denoted by M. Our basic measure averages the
eighteen individual management practices as a proxy for M. We experimented with a number of other
approaches, such as using the primary factor, and found very similar results.

8

We experimented with a wide range of workforce characteristics such as gender, worker age, education and unionization,
finding our results robust to these additional controls.

9

The most straightforward approach to estimating equation (1) is to simply run OLS on the panel with
standard errors clustered by firm and assume that all the correlated heterogeneity is captured by the
control variables.9 Table 2 investigates the association between firm performance and management
practices. Column 1 simply reports an OLS specification controlling only for year and industry fixed
effects. The management score is strongly positively and significantly associated with higher labor
productivity (coefficient 0.490, standard error 0.093). In column 2 we introduce our additional “noise
controls”, regional controls and firm characteristics. In line with our expectations these additional
control variables reduce the measurement error in the management score and as a result the coefficient
on management increases to 0.531 and is significant at the 1% level. In the rest of the table we
introduce progressively more information on the other production factors. In column 3 we control for
labor, whereas in columns 4 we also introduce capital, energy and materials controls. In column 5 we
control for workforce skills as well. The coefficient on management, although diminishing in value, is
always positive and significant at 0.044. The economic magnitude of this effect is also substantial:
improving the quality of management from the 25th to 75th percentile (ΔM=0.840 from Table 1) is
associated with a 3.7% (=0.044×0.840) increase in total-factor productivity. These results parallel the
findings of Bloom and Van Reenen (2007) indicating a positive and strong association between firm
level management practices and establishment-level total factor productivity (TFP) across firms in four
countries.

3.2 Management practices and Energy Intensity
Before analysing econometrically the relationship between managerial quality and energy intensity, it
is informative to look at the raw distribution non-parametrically. Figure 3 plots the kernel density of
energy expenditure over gross output for the best managed (top quartile) versus the worst (bottom
quartile) managed firms. Two key facts become evident from this graph. First, there are more well
managed firms that consume energy less intensively (“fatter” left tail of the distribution), and second,
their whole distribution is to the left of that of the worst managed firms, indicating lower energy
intensity overall.

9

A large literature is concerned with endogeneity and biases in this kind of regression (see Griliches Mairesse 1996 for a
summary.) We examine the robustness of our main results with respect to issue by implementing a control function
approach (Olley and Pakes, 1996; Levinsohn and Petrin 2003; Martin, 2008). These results are available on request.

To investigate the relationship between management practices and energy intensity of production in
more detail, we consider the following specification:

(EE / GO)it ×100 = α in goit + α l lit + α k kit + β

M i + γ ' Z it + uit

(2)

where EE/GO×100 = energy expenditure over gross output in percentage terms, GO = gross output
(sales and inventory changes), L = labor, K = capital, and M = our management practices score for firm
i at time t. Lower case letters again denote natural logarithms, e.g. l = ln(L). The matrix Z consists of a
number of control variables that affect productivity, such as workforce characteristics (the proportion
of workers with a degree), firm characteristics (firm age), and a complete set of three digits industry
binary indicators.
Table 3 reports the results from this specification. Column 1 simply regresses energy intensity –
defined as the energy share of gross-output – on management practices, controlling for year and
industry differences. The management coefficient is strongly negative and significant, indicating that
well managed firms consume energy more efficiently given their level of output. In column 2 the
introduction of our “noise controls” and firm characteristics renders the management coefficient
stronger and more statistically significant. In column 3 we introduce (log) gross output to control for
possible scale effects. The coefficient on gross output is negative which is consistent with scale effects
– i.e. larger firms requiring less energy per unit of output – but not significant. The coefficient on
management reduces slightly from –0.394 to –0.326 but is still significant. In columns 4 to 6 we
experiment using labour and capital as proxies for size. The management coefficient is not significantly
affected by their inclusion although its point estimate is somewhat larger than in column 3.
In columns 7 and 8 we re-introduce gross output. Once both gross output and employment or capital
are introduced, the former becomes significantly negative, whereas capital and labour become positive,
although not significant. This suggests that there are two opposing effects. On the one hand, there is a
scale effect: larger output means that energy intensity reduces (there appear to be energy “economies of
scale”). On the other hand, more labour or capital intensive firms require more energy. However,
irrespective of this heterogeneity, better managed firms are always significantly less energy intensive.
The economic magnitude of these coefficients is large. For example, the coefficient of -0.362 in

Source: Authors’ calculations based on census production (ARD) and CEP management survey data.
Notes: The dependent variable in all regressions is energy expenditure over gross output. All columns include a full set of year binary indicators. "Management” is the
average scores across the eighteen questions on management practices from the CEP management survey; output and factor input variables (labor, capital, materials,
energy) are from the census production data (ARD). Column 3 introduces gross output to control for size. A potential issue is that instead of output in volume units,
we only observe revenue. We therefore also include the other production factors in subsequent columns to correct for any possible scale effects. Noise controls are a
set of variables capturing interview characteristics: duration and time of the interview, the gender of the interviewee, the reliability and competence of the interviewee
as perceived by the interviewer and binary indicators for each interviewer. Standard errors clustered at the firm level (i.e. robust to heteroskedasticity and
autocorrelation of unknown form) are reported in parenthesis below coefficients: *significant at 10%; **significant at 5%; ***significant at 1%.

column 8 suggests that at the sample mean of EE/GO (1.744) improving managerial practices from the
25th to the 75th percentile (an increase in management of 0.840) is associated with a 17.4% reduction in
energy intensity (βM×ΔM/(EE/GO) = -0.362 × 0.840 / 1.744% = -17.4%). Finally, in column 9 we
include controls for skills, as an additional proxy for firm type. The negative correlation between
energy intensity and management practices persists and continues to be significant.
A number of concerns might arise with these results. First, our results imply nothing on the causality of
the relationship between management and energy efficiency. It is quite possible this correlation is
driven by other unobserved factors, for example that hiring management consultants helps to improve
management practices and reduce energy usage. The evidence we have is merely suggestive, in that
well managed firms appear to be robustly more energy efficient. As the first study of its kind to show
this, we believe this is an interesting result in itself. We are also running field experiments in India to
change the management practices of a randomly selected group of textiles firms to evaluate the causal
impact of this on energy intensity.
Second, because in our firm level data we do not have firm specific price information, our gross output
measure captures both variations in actual output and variations in output price. Better managed firms
might plausibly be able to charge higher prices for their products, increasing the mark-up and reducing
factor cost-shares. In appendix C (Table C1) we therefore repeat the regressions from Table 3 using
energy expenditure over variable costs (expenditure on labour and intermediates, VCOST) as our
dependent variable. None of our results from Table 3 change in any fundamental way. To ensure that
our results are driven by variations in energy expenditure rather than variation in the denominator (GO
or VCOST), in Table C2 we also report similar regressions where we use (log) energy expenditure (log
EE) as the dependent variable. In columns 1 and where we do not include any controls for firm size this
leads to a positive and significant coefficient, because better managed firms are larger on average. With
size controls from column 3 onward, the management coefficient turns significantly negative in line
with our earlier results. Finally, we examine our results using log energy shares (Table C3). The main
justification for using just energy shares in tables 2 and 3 is that such an approach is consistent with the
popular translog factor estimation (Christensen, Jorgenson, Lau, 1971; Christensen, Greene, 1976).
However, as it is evident from the table, this choice is not essential for our basic correlation between
managerial practices and energy intensity.

12

3.3 Quantifying the Effect of Management on Energy Intensity
While we can not interpret our results as causal, it is nevertheless interesting to explore their economic
magnitude. For this purpose we conduct the following counterfactual experiment: what reduction in
energy usage would occur if we increased managerial practices in a firm from the lowest to the top
quartile, assuming that its energy intensity change in line with the sample average correlation? And in a
similar spirit: what would be the resulting reduction in energy usage if the average UK firm – which
has a very similar average management score to the average firm in Europe10 - were to experience an
improvement in its management that would elevate it to the average US firm?
Notice that we have no direct information on the greenhouse gas pollution. However, if we are willing
to assume that there is a constant rate of carbon pollution associated with every unit spent on energy,
then the percentage impact on pollution will be equal to the percentage impact on expenditure.
We calculate the counterfactual percentage change in energy expenditure as follows:

EE CF − EE
⎛ EE ⎞
= β M ΔM / ⎜
⎟
EE
⎝ GO ⎠
where EECF is the counterfactual energy expenditure. In other words, the percentage impact on energy
expenditure is equal to the change in management quality times the coefficient on management in a
factor share regression, divided by energy intensity.
Table 4 reports the results from a number of counterfactual scenarios. The first scenario in row one
considers the impact on energy intensity of moving from the bottom quartile management score (2.263)
to the top quartile management score (3.894), an improvement of 1.631.

The coefficient on

management from column 8 in Table 3 is βM = -0.362. Multiplying by the 1.631 management change
and dividing by the bottom quartile energy intensity of 1.787% we get a one third reduction of energy
expenditure, 33%. Rows 2 to 3 report the results of similar calculations for the other two quartiles.
Perhaps most interestingly is the implied aggregate effect on energy usage, calculated as the sum of the
percentage change in energy expenditure (column 5) weighted by the share of energy consumption for
10

In the sample our UK average management score is 2.97 while the average across our firm sample from Europe (France,
Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Sweden) is 2.98.

Notes: The table reports results of the various counterfactual scenarios based on the results from Tables 1-3. The
management coefficient in column 1 is taken from Table 3, column 8. Differences across quartiles in management scores
and energy expenditure over gross output are taken from Table 1. Column 3 is based on energy expenditure values from
Table 1. Last column is calculated based on the formula provided in the text.

each quartile (column 3). Finally, in row 5 we examine the impact of a change in management quality
corresponding to the average difference between the US and UK of ∆M = 0.362 on the average UK
firm; i.e. an energy expenditure over gross output of 1.744%. This last scenario leads to a more modest
7.5% reduction in energy expenditure, suggesting the improving the management practices of firms in
the UK and Europe could be associated with reductions in energy intensity of 5% to 10%.

3.4 Effect on other factors
The analysis so far naturally raises questions about the factor intensity usage of other inputs: do better
managed firms use all factor inputs less intensively, or substitute across different types of factor inputs?
In summary, we find that better managed firms use less energy and materials, but a higher level of
capital and (skilled) labor inputs.
Table 5 examines this by reporting factor intensity results for materials, capital and labor. Columns 1
and 2 report regressions of the intensity in intermediate inputs including energy, whereas columns 3
and 4 exclude energy from intermediates. All materials input regressions yield significantly negative
coefficient for management although the results without energy lead to somewhat lower (in absolute
terms) and less significant point estimates. Better managed firms use less materials and less energy in
their production process. Columns 5 and 6 report results for labor intensity (measured by the total wage
bill) and 7 and 8 for capital intensity (measured by the stock of tangible fixed-assets)11. The results
from these last four columns strongly indicate that better managed firms are more labor and capital
intensive even when controlling for size by including (log) gross output. This higher labour intensity
appears to be due to a higher skill content of the workers, leading to a higher total wage bill.12

11

To compute cost shares for capital we would have to make assumptions about depreciation and interest rates to derive the
user cost of capital. To avoid that we simply examine the ratio between capital stocks and output or costs. As it is not
bounded between zero and one, as the cost shares, we report results in log terms.
12
Across the sample of all 601 UK firms covered by the CEP management survey the correlations (and their p-value)
between management and the log(% of employees with a degree) is 0.127 (0.003) and between management and the
log(average wage) is 0.171 (0.000). The same figures for the full sample of 5,198 firms from all 12 countries in the survey
are 0.2607 (0.000) and 0.309 (0.000).

Source: Authors’ calculations based on census production (ARD) and CEP management survey data.
Notes: The table reports regressions of materials, labor and capital factor intensities. The dependent variable in the first six columns is multiplied by 100. Note that
material and labour intensities are reported without logs which can be rationalised by a translog factor demand framework. For capital we only have a volume, but no
expenditure index. Hence, capital over gross output is not bounded between zero and one and for that reason we report it in log terms. All columns include a full set of
year binary indicators. "Management” is the average scores across the eighteen questions on management practices from the CEP management survey; output and factor
input variables (labor, capital, materials, energy) are from the census production data (ARD). Noise controls are a set of variables capturing interview characteristics:
duration and time of the interview, the gender of the interviewee, the reliability and competence of the interviewee as perceived by the interviewer and binary indicators
for each interviewer. Standard errors clustered at the firm level (i.e. robust to heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation of unknown form) are reported in parenthesis below
coefficients: *significant at 10%;**significant at 5%; ***significant at 1%.

3.5 Effect on CO2 and energy quantity
So far we implicitly assumed that energy prices do not vary systematically between firms after
controlling for size, so that variations in energy expenditure intensity directly translate into variations
in energy usage and pollution of the key greenhouse gas, CO2. For a highly integrated energy market
such as the UK this does not seem unreasonable. Nevertheless in this section we provide some further
evidence to support this assumption. Specifically, we confirm our key findings using quantity data on
energy usage from the Quarterly Fuels Inquiry (QFI).13 The QFI is a survey run by the UK Office of
National Statistics, which inquires about the usage of a variety of different fuels at the firm level.
However, its sample size is about a tenth of the ARD used for the results above. As a result, the overlap
between QFI and management survey data sample is fairly small with less than 300 observations. For
this reason we did not use it for our main analysis, but it nevertheless provides a useful cross-validation
of our main results.
Table 6 contains the main QFI results. Column 1 looks simply at kWh of energy used and column 2
looks at the ratio between kWh and gross output. In either case we find a significantly negative
relationship with management, i.e. better management firms use less kWh of energy. Columns 3 and 4
repeat the exercise with CO2 (we compute CO2 emissions on the basis of the quantity information on
different fuel types and common conversion factors for the carbon content of fuels as reported in the
appendix, table D1). Again we find a negative relationship, which is significant at the 10% level.

4. Conclusions
In this paper we match information that quantifies the firm-level managerial quality, following the
methodology developed by Bloom and Van Reenen (2007), to their establishment-level data in the UK
census of production. Since the census data contains energy usage data, this allows us to undertake the
first evaluation of the firm level association between management practices and energy intensity. We
find a robust negative correlation between management practices and energy intensity. Better managed
firms are more energy intensive, with the correlation substantial in magnitude – improving
management levels from the 25th to the 75th percentile is associated with a 17.4% reduction in energy
intensity. We also find a strong correlation between better management practices and establishment13

Notes: The table reports regressions of kWh and carbon dioxide used in production. These variables are based
on data from the Quarterly Fuels Inquiry (QFI). To compute CO2 values on the basis of energy quantities we
use the conversion factors reported in table D1 of the appendix. The QFI has a much smaller sample than the
production census data (ARD). Hence, the intersection of all three datasets lead to a sample of only about 300
firms. To identify all control variables we run all regressions on the full sample of firms with QFI information
and include a dummy equal to one when the management information is missing. All columns include a full set
of year binary indicators. "Management” is the average scores across the eighteen questions on management
practices from the CEP management survey; output and factor input variables (labor, capital, materials, energy)
are from the census production data (ARD). Noise controls are a set of variables capturing interview

level productivity, with a move from the 25th to 75th percentile of management associated with a 3.7%
increase in total-factor productivity.
These results suggest that management practices that are associated with improved productivity are not
linked to worse environmental performance. Rather, is broadly supportive of the idea that well run
firms use energy inputs more efficiently, thereby increasing profitability and productivity while at the
same time reducing carbon emissions. Future research will seek to evaluate the causal nature of the
relationship between management practices and energy intensity by using field experiments to
randomly change management practices and evaluate its impact on energy intensity.

slowly? Are there any examples you can think of?
c) How would you identify and develop (i.e. train) your star
performers?
d) If two people both joined the company 5 years ago and one
was much better than the other would he/she be promoted
faster?

opposed to your competitors?
b) If you were trying to sell your firm to me how would you
do this (get them to try to do this)?
c) What don’t people like about working in your firm?

Incentives

a) If you had a star performer who wanted to leave what
would the company do?

APPENDIX B: MATCHING CENSUS TO FIRM-LEVEL DATA
To combine the firm-level survey data with the ONS census data we rely on a lookup table
provided by the ONS mapping from CRN (Ralf: explain these acronyms and include acronym in a
parenthesis) to IDBR. However, this lookup table is not complete for three reasons. First, for some
records the ONS relied on name matching, which often does not lead to results if different names or
spellings are used. Second, because the CRN and IDBR system are maintained independently the
same businesses is sometimes represented differently in either register. The IDBR identifies
business units according to functional units, which are relevant for the computing of government
statistics. A CRN number is created whenever a company’s management deems it necessary to
register a new business name. Third, the lookup table is currently only provided for 2004. Hence,
there is no match for businesses created after this date. Table B1 provides descriptive statistics
comparing a number of key statistics between matched and non-matched companies. A plant is
matched with higher probability if it is older, larger, better managed and also owned by a larger
firm.
We also subjected the data to a number of cleaning steps. Our key variables of interest in this study
are factor expenditure and revenue shares. For a small number of firms factor revenue shares are
either negative or larger than one (often several orders of magnitude larger). This is not consistent
with any standard models of firm behaviour and likely a consequence of misreporting and
measurement error; e.g. revenue being reported in 1000s and expenditure just in pound or vice
versa. To avoid that our results are driven by any of this we firstly, we dropped establishments
whose share of variable costs (materials plus labour cost) in gross output (VCOST/GO) was larger
than one. We further dropped firms in the top and bottom percentile of the VCOST/GO distribution.
Finally, we dropped establishments who had changes of more than 200 percent from year to year in
VCOST/GO. Many of our results still go through even if we do not perform all of these steps.
However, they ensure that things are more consistent; e.g. the dropping top and bottom percentiles
is key for getting similar results when running either regressions of log factor shares or simply
regression of factor shares.

Source: Authors’ calculations based on census production (ARD) and CEP management survey data.
Notes: The dependent variable in all regressions is energy expenditure over variable costs (labor costs and materials expenditure). All columns include a full set of year
binary indicators. "Management” is the average scores across the eighteen questions on management practices from the CEP management survey; output and factor input
variables (labor, capital, materials, energy) are from the census production data (ARD). Column 3 introduces gross output to control for size. A potential issue is that instead
of output in volume units, we only observe revenue. We therefore also include the other production factors in subsequent columns, to correct for any possible scale effects.
Noise controls are a set of variables capturing interview characteristics: duration and time of the interview, the gender of the interviewee, the reliability and competence of the
interviewee as perceived by the interviewer and binary indicators for each interviewer. Standard errors clustered at the firm level (i.e. robust to heteroskedasticity and
autocorrelation of unknown form) are reported in parenthesis below coefficients: *significant at 10%; **significant at 5%; ***significant at 1%.
