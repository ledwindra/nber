    "abstract": "\n\nThis study conceptualizes and demonstrates empirically that existing non-climate policies can induce climate adaptation. Adaptation involves adjusting to or coping with climatic change with the goal of reducing our vulnerability to its harmful effects. We examine the impact of temperature on ambient ozone concentration in the United States from 1980-2013. Ozone is formed under warm temperatures, but regulated by the Clean Air Act. These air quality standards may act as a buffer against extreme increases in ambient ozone concentration. Indeed, adaptation in counties out of attainment with the standards is 107 percent larger than under attainment, implying substantial regulation-induced adaptation.\n\n",
