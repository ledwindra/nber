    "abstract": "\n\nSince 2012 the Congressional Budget Office has included an estimate of the market value of government-provided health insurance coverage in its measures of household income.  We follow this practice for both public and private health insurance to capture the impact of greater access to government-provided health insurance for working-age people with disabilities, whose value rose in 2010 dollars from $11.7B in 1980 to $114.3B in 2012. We then consider the more general implications of incorporating estimates of the market price of insurance, equivalent to that provided by the government, into policy analyses in a post-Affordable Care Act world.\n\n",
