ABSTRACT
We consider the effects of daytime fasting by pregnant women during the lunar month of Ramadan
on their children's test scores at age seven. Using English register data, we find that scores are .05
to .08 standard deviations lower for Pakistani and Bangladeshi students exposed to Ramadan in early
pregnancy. These estimates are downward biased to the extent that Ramadan is not universally observed.
We conclude that the effects of prenatal investments on test scores are comparable to many conventional
educational interventions but are likely to be more cost effective and less subject to "fade out".

1 Introduction
A growing literature has documented that early childhood investments those made prior to
formal schooling years are more productive in increasing human capital than interventions
that come later in life [Heckman and Masterov, 2007]. There is also increasing recognition
that investments that occur during the prenatal period may potentially be even more effective than postnatal interventions and signicantly less costly to undertake [Doyle et al.,
2009].

Targeting interventions during the in utero period, therefore, may be particularly

compelling on the grounds of economic eciency.
As emphasized by Heckman and others, learning is a dynamic process that begins well before school: capabilities beget capabilities [Heckman, 2007]. Furthermore, human capacity
is inherently multidimensional, including health, cognitive, and non-cognitive components
which are synergistic over the life course.

For example, better health early in life may

facilitate learning during school going years.

The fetal origins literature has highlighted

the staged, developmental nature of early human growth and has emphasized that specic
pregnancy sub-periods are thought to imprint distinct physiologic functions. Furthermore,
research in developmental neuroscience has demonstrated the greater plasticity of the brain
early in life and that there are sensitive periods during which particular aspects of cognitive
development take place [Doyle et al., 2009]. These brief windows naturally lend themselves
to targeted interventions that may be especially cost eective during the prenatal period.
This may be contrasted with more conventional educational interventions which may be
costly to implement. For example, Project STAR [Krueger, 1999, Krueger and Whitmore,
2001, Chetty et al., 2011], which improved student outcomes through reduced class sizes for
a two year period, (on average) cost over $10,000 per student in 2010 dollars.

Finally, a

signature feature of fetal-induced changes to health and educational outcomes is their persistence into adulthood. In contrast, the cognitive eects from more conventional education
interventions may be subject to fade out (e.g.

Heckman et al. [2010], Rothstein [2010],

Cascio and Staiger [2011]).
Focusing on early antecedents of childhood human capital development, however, is
challenging since certain factors are dicult, if not impossible, to modify (e.g. genes). From
an empirical point of view, even among the subset of modiable inputs, it is particularly
dicult to distinguish predictors from those factors that may actually exert causal eects.
Even where causal pathways exist, the eventual eects may remain latent for many years.
Therefore, identifying such pathways may require unique data sets that are able to link
long-term outcomes to early-life experiences.
In this paper, we argue that the diurnal fast undertaken by pregnant Muslims during the
month of Ramadan constitutes a modiable determinant of prenatal development that has

2

signicant long-term eects on academic outcomes. A central feature of our identication
strategy is the fact that Ramadan follows a lunar calendar, and thereby falls on dierent
dates (and seasons) in dierent years.

We present evidence showing that the timing of

pregnancy vis à vis Ramadan appears exogenous on observable characteristics.

We can

therefore compare persons born just before Ramadan, and thereby not exposed during pregnancy, to those exposed at dierent months of gestation using an intent to treat approach.
As Ramadan lasts for one lunar month, the exposure period is necessarily brief, especially
compared to conventional educational interventions.
Our approach departs in four ways from previous design-based observational studies of
fetal origins eects. First, we consider an input, the timing of prenatal nutrition, that is
relatively manipulable.

Although pregnant women are not automatically exempted from

fasting, they can request an exception which typically requires them to make up the days
later. Many Muslim scholars argue that the Ramadan fast is not obligatory for pregnant
women, and, although observance is the norm, fasting rates during pregnancy do vary somewhat across societies.

1

This suggests that there is scope for adaptation in practices.

In

contrast, other studies have utilized natural experiments, such as famines or inuenza pandemics, where variation in the environment is caused by conditions outside the control
of the mother [Currie, 2009].

While extreme natural events provide credible sources for

identication, they are less relevant when considering policies that may modify individual
behavior. Second, since the Ramadan fast primarily aects the diurnal timing of nutrition,
it constitutes a far less extreme treatment than the famine episodes, pandemics, and natural disasters previously analyzed. Therefore, it is informative about whether less extreme
shocks to the fetal environment also have long-term eects. In particular, meal skipping,
morning sickness and dieting during pregnancy (especially prior to pregnancy recognition)
are fairly common in developed countries and are comparable to fasting in terms of eects
on the timing of nutrition and their eects on the intrauterine environment. Thus, the identied linkages to the prenatal period may generalize to other populations. Third, as most
Muslims were in utero during a Ramadan, and fasting during pregnancy remains common
today, the population aected by fasting is much larger than those aicted by historical
famine episodes or disease outbreaks, i.e. the estimates of fasting's impact is of interest per
se . Finally, in contrast to previous studies which have examined long-term adult outcomes,

we focus on measures of human capital at age 7 to shed light on how fetal-induced eects
are rst manifested during the primary school years. In this respect, our analysis is novel
compared with other recent studies of the long-term eects of Ramadan fasting (Almond
and Mazumder [2011], Van Ewijk [2011]).

1

For example, at Sorrento Maternity Hospital in Birmingham, England, three quarters of Muslim mothers

reported fasting during pregnancy that coincided with Ramadan [Eaton and Wharton, 1982].

3

Our study uses school register data from England containing the national Key Stage
1 assessments in math, reading and writing. We use Pakistani or Bangladeshi ancestry to
identify Muslim students and estimate dierence in dierence models to estimate the eects
of Ramadan exposure on Muslims compared to non-Muslims during the in utero period. Our
main nding is that Muslim students exposed to Ramadan fasting in the rst trimester of
their mothers' pregnancy have signicantly lower achievement scores. For example, we nd
that the math scores of students who were exposed to Ramadan during the rst trimester
are reduced by 0.06 to 0.08 standard deviations. To the extent that not all pregnant Muslim
women are fasting, our estimates understate the true eect size and serve as a lower bound.
The magnitudes of the eects are comparable to many conventional educational interventions
such as the eects of charter schools, Teach for America or Head Start [Dobbie and Fryer,
2011]. Relative to these interventions, however, the potential costs of altering behavior may
be signicantly lower.

2 Literature Review
2.1 Economics
From an economic perspective, one can gain insight into the potential importance of early
life experiences through a model of human capital production. As suggested by Heckman,
the dierent stages of childhood can be viewed as distinct inputs into the production of
subsequent capacity. Let

I2

I1

denote investments occurring during the prenatal period and

investments during the postnatal period (i.e. the rest of childhood). Given that cognitive

development early in life occurs in distinct stages,

I1

and

I2

are likely imperfect substitutes

in the production of capacity. In the extreme case of a Leontie technology, human capacity
cannot exceed that determined by the minimum of investments during the prenatal period
[Heckman, 2007].
Furthermore, if there are multiple dimensions to capacity (e.g. cognitive, non-cognitive,
health) then there can be synergies across these dimensions.

For example, a child born

in better health may have an advantage in creating cognitive and non-cognitive capacity.
Finally, the production technology may incorporate dynamic complementarities [Heckman,
2007] whereby investments in stage
level of capability in stage

t

of childhood are more productive when there is a high

t − 1.

Economists have also sought to establish links between prenatal conditions and human
capital outcomes empirically. For example, Currie and Hyson [1999] using the British National Child Development Survey found that the pass rate for math and English O-level
tests was roughly 25% lower for low birth weight children. More recent design-based empirical studies by economists have found that human capital outcomes respond to a range of

4

prenatal shocks, particularly those experienced during rst half of pregnancy. Field et al.
[2009] evaluated the eect of prenatal iodine supplementation on subsequent educational
attainment in Tanzania, nding that supplementation during the rst trimester increased
completed schooling by as much as half a year. These eects persisted in a siblings comparison, and were generally stronger among girls. Almond, Edlund, and Palme [2009] studied
prenatal exposure to radioactive fallout from the 1986 Chernobyl meltdown on middle school
performance in Sweden. Exposure to ionizing radiation between weeks 8 and 25 of gestation reduced the likelihood of qualifying for high school by 3% and reduced math grades by
6% (the measure closest to IQ). Interestingly, no health eects of radiation exposure were
detected in the prenatally exposed cohorts, suggesting the damage was subclinical. Kelly
[2011] considered the impact of prenatal exposure to the fall 1957 avian u pandemic in
Britain, using the serendipitous timing of the 1958 British cohort study (born March 1958).
Kelly [2011] found negative impacts on test scores that interestingly appeared independent
from the negative impact of the 1957 pandemic on birth weight.
While recent studies have successfully exploited natural experiments to demonstrate
causal pathways, the incidences of such prenatal experiences are relatively rare and are not
likely to be the main determinants of current modiable dierences in the prenatal environment, particularly in developed countries. As we describe in the next section, the biophysical
changes induced by Ramadan fasting during pregnancy resemble those occasioned by other
determinants of nutrition timing in developed countries such as meal skipping, dieting, and
nausea and vomiting (morning sickness).

2.2 Biological Mechanisms
Almond and Mazumder [2011] and Van Ewijk [2011] provide overviews of the biomedical literature concerning the potential pathways between prenatal fasting and long-term outcomes.
We briey review some of the mechanisms that may be particularly relevant for cognitive
function. One potential pathway arises through a set of biochemical changes known as accelerated starvation that occurs in pregnant women who undergo an extended period of
fasting. Pregnant women experience pronounced declines in blood glucose levels and sharp
increases in ketones and free fatty acids as they begin to metabolize their stores of fat. Such
conditions can arise in as little as 12 hours and studies have documented these changes
during the Ramadan fast in both developed and developing countries (Prentice et al. 1983,
Malhotra et al. 1989). Animal studies have linked exposure to ketones early in pregnancy
to neurological impairments (e.g. Hunter and Sadler 1987) and studies of humans have associated ketone exposure in diabetic mothers to diminished cognitive ability [Rizzo et al.,
1991].
The literature on the developmental origins of health and adult disease has emphasized

5

how environmental exposures in pregnancy, such as nutritional disruptions, can lead to
permanent alterations in the body's systems in order to improve the likelihood of survival
to reproductive age in the perceived environment at birth [Gluckman and Hanson, 2005].
These predictive adaptive responses (PARs) make individuals more prone to poor health
in adulthood. The most well-known examples relate to heart disease and diabetes, but there
may be other manifestations of PARs as well. Although the literature has only begun to
speculate at the precise mechanisms behind PARs, disruptions to the ow of glucose are
thought to be one of the key signals of poor environmental condition during fetal development. Gluckman and Hanson note that the developing embryo will change the relative
assignment of cells to the inner cell and outer cell mass according to whether it perceives a
problem in glucose supply [Gluckman and Hanson, 2005, p31-32].
One particular example of a PAR that has received signicant attention in the literature
is the notion that prenatal nutritional deprivation or maternal stress can lead to alterations
in the neuro-endocrine system or HPA axis which in turn, can lead to permanent health
eects. PARs operating through the HPA axis are notable for our purposes for two reasons.
First, several studies have linked maternal stress during pregnancy to behavioral and cognitive decits in children [Kapoor et al., 2006, LeWinn et al., 2009, Aizer et al., 2009], and
it is hypothesized that this may be due to modications to the HPA axis. Direct evidence
linking the HPA axis to cognitive impairments has been found in animal studies. Second, a
recent study documented elevated levels of the hormone cortisol, which occurs when there is
heightened sensitivity in the HPA axis, among pregnant women who fasted during Ramadan
[Dikensoy et al., 2009].

It is also worth noting that another recent study co-authored by

David Barker, one of the pioneering epidemiologists in the fetal origins eld, linked Ramadan
fasting to alterations in placental growth due to fetal programming [Alwasel et al., 2010].
The brain is thought to be especially susceptible to the fetal environment due to the
complexity of its development. Gluckman and Hanson write: this complexity means that
the fetal brain is very sensitive to environmental stimuli that might irreversibly damage
it [Gluckman and Hanson, 2005, p46]. They further note that the number of neurons is
almost entirely determined in fetal life and is largely completed in mid-gestation [Gluckman
and Hanson, 2005, p46] suggesting that nutritional shocks in the rst half of pregnancy
may be especially harmful. They further point out that the fetal environment may play a
contributing role in the development of certain psychiatric diseases.

6

2.3 Long-term Eects of Ramadan Fasting
We are aware of three studies that examine eects of prenatal exposure to Ramadan fasting
on childhood or adult outcomes.

2

Azizi et al. [2004] found no statistically signicant eects

of fasting on the IQ scores of 191 children between the ages of 4 and 13 attending 15 primary
schools in Iran. The study compared 98 treated children whose mothers fasted for at least
27 days during Ramadan, with 93 control children whose mothers did not fast at all during
Ramadan. However, mean dierences between the treatment and control groups were found
in certain characteristics, such as breast feeding duration and socioeconomic status, that
3

were either statistically signicant or quantitatively meaningful.

In addition to having

a relatively small sample, the study appeared to have selected cases based on potential
4

outcomes which could have imparted some bias.

More recently, Almond and Mazumder [2011] linked Ramadan fasting to adult outcomes
in Uganda and Iraq using Census data. They nd that full exposure to Ramadan fasting
in the rst month of pregnancy increased the likelihood of a disability by about 20% with
especially large eects on mental/learning disabilities. Van Ewijk [2011], also focusing on
adult samples of Indonesians from the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS), found eects
of fasting on a variety of measures of health including coronary heart problems and diabetes. Both Almond and Mazumder [2011] and Van Ewijk [2011] utilize a research design
that compares Muslims whose in utero period overlapped with Ramadan to Muslims who
were unexposed and show that pre-determined observable characteristics do not vary with
exposure.

2

5

There are a number of studies in the biomedical literature that examine the eects of fasting during

Ramadan on fetal and birth outcomes which are discussed in Almond and Mazumder [2011]. As noted here,
most previous studies rely on the strong assumption that non-fasters are comparable to fasters at a point
in time and typically use samples that lack sucient power to detect small but quantitatively meaningful
eects. In contrast, using the universe of natality data on 18 birth cohorts from the U.S. state of Michigan,
Almond and Mazumder [2011] nd signicant eects of fasting on lowering birth weight and reducing the
likelihood of a male birth.

3

The duration of breastfeeding was about three months longer in the treated group (statistically signicant

at the 5 percent level). An index of socioeconomic status as well as income and home ownership were also
all higher in the treated group, though not statistically signicant. For example, 18 percent of the treated
owned their own home compared to 13 percent of the control group.

4

Of the 141 children who could have been included in the treated group the sample of 98 included

all

of those who fasted in the third trimester but only a sample of those who fasted earlier in pregnancy.
The oversampling of those with late exposure is problematic since the neuro-development literature has
emphasized the importance of early exposure. Further, they appear to have selected sample members such
that mothers with any history of problems such as drug consumption, smoking, and thyroid dysfunction
during pregnancy, dystocia, and other problems during dierent stages of development aecting children's
IQ from the fetal stage to childhood were excluded.

5

Van Ewijk [2011] also nds that the results are robust to including mother xed eects suggesting that

any unobservable forms of selection would have to be sibling-specic.

3 Data and methodology
3.1 Data
In England, all students attending state schools are assessed at dierent points in their
schooling career, or Key Stages, to measure their academic performance in dierent subject
areas. We start with the population of students who were assessed at Key Stage 1 between
1998 and 2007 when they were approximately 7 years old. The Key Stage 1 score is based
6

on a teacher assessment of the students' prociency in reading, writing and mathematics.

Teacher assessments are made following detailed guidelines based on National curriculum
levels that describe levels of prociency in each subject area. The assessment is based on a
7

combination of tests and tasks that take less than three hours to administer.

Students at

Key Stage 1 should be at level 2. The teacher assessment can take on one of the following
8

values: 1, 2C, 2B, 2A, 3, 4 or above.

Following Department of Education guidelines, we

translate these assessments into numerical scores which we then transform in z -scores using
the full sample.

9,10

We also use as an aggregate measure the rst principal component from a

principal components analysis (PCA) on math, reading and writing. This variable captures
83% of the total variance of the three constituent subjects.
We use a unique student identier to link the Key Stage 1 scores to other student level
data contained in the Pupil Level Annual School Census (PLASC). The PLASC is constructed based on electronic records provided by each school in England to the Department
for Education and Skills (DfES) and covers all enrolled pupils as of January of each year.
Starting with the 2002 data we link the Key Stage 1 scores to the PLASC for that year.
However, prior to 2002, some of the key background characteristics we require such as ethnicity are unavailable in the contemporaneous PLASC. Instead we link these individuals

6

Prior to 2004, our data contained both teacher assessments

and standardized tests (National Curriculum

tests) but starting in 2005 we only have the teacher assessment. Therefore in order to have a uniform measure
across all years we use the teacher assessment measure. Since students at this level have only 1 teacher and
since the teacher gives these assessments at the end of the school year, when he or she knows the child well,
this may actually provide a more reliable measure than standardized test scores which contain considerable
noise [Kane and Staiger, 2002].

Level 4 for math and reading only exists from 2002 on. Levels 2A, 2B, and 2C do not exist before 2004

(only level 2 exists in these years). In addition, students can be assessed as: W for a child who is working
towards level 1; A for a child not assessed due to absence, or a child who has had a long period of absence,
or there is insucient information to enable a teacher assessment result to be calculated; or D for a child
for whom teacher assessment has been disapplied.

9

W = 3 points; level 1 = 9 points; level 2C = 13 points; level 2B = 15 points; level 2 = 15 points

(where no breakdown of level 2 reported); level 2A = 17 points; level 3 = 21 points; level 4 = 27 points, see
http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000867/SFR21-2009.pdf

Standardizing the scores per cohort instead of over the full sample gives virtually the same results as

3.2 Dierence in dierence strategy
Previous work on adult outcomes [Almond and Mazumder, 2011, Van Ewijk, 2011] has
used an intent to treat (ITT) design that compares the outcomes of Muslims who were
in utero during Ramadan to those who weren't. One important issue in this identication

strategy is separating seasonal factors from true fasting eects since it is well established
that season of birth (or conception) has long-run eects [Doblhammer and Vaupel, 2001].
This is particularly important in the context of studying educational outcomes because the
age cutos that determine school entry lead to a sharp discontinuity in school performance
by timing of birth. This is apparent in England as can be seen in Figure 1 where those born
12

on or after September 1 have signicantly higher Key Stage 1 math scores.

It is also clear

that in addition to this discontinuity, there is a notable trend reecting the age at which
one is assessed.
The prior studies took advantage of the gradual movement over time of Ramadan
throughout the Gregorian calendar year.

Since Ramadan is based on the lunar calendar,

it begins about 11 days earlier each year. Therefore, with data covering three decades of
birth cohorts, one can employ standard seasonal controls (e.g. month dummies) and readily
remove confounding eects since Ramadan would have made a complete cycle over the year.
In these prior studies the eects are identied by comparing Muslims whose prenatal period
overlapped with Ramadan to those who were never in utero during Ramadan, and the same
estimation approach can be applied separately to non-Muslims as a falsication check.
In our case, however, we have only ten birth cohorts whose potential prenatal Ramadan
exposure only could have occurred during one of ve winter and spring months (December
to April) and so it is not obvious that seasonal controls are sucient.

Given the limited

number of cohorts and the strong seasonal eects for educational outcomes, we instead utilize
a dierence in dierence strategy where we take the eect on Muslims and further subtract
any eects for non-Muslims that may arise due to possible seasonal eects. The number of
birth cohorts also motivates our use of the Key Stage 1 assessments since even fewer cohorts
would be available if we used Key Stage 2 test scores in our sample.

11

As we show later,

We rst must link these students to the 2005 PLASC where we are able to retrieve an identier that

allows us to link them back to 2002. This imposes a requirement that the students who take the Key Stage
1 prior to 2002 must have remained in the English school system through 2005. We do not think that this
selection rule is much of a concern since the students who took the test as early as 1998 would still only
be 14 years old as of 2005 and therefore highly likely to have remained in school. We will however, remove
students who either left England or left the state school system by 2005.

12

For example, those born on August 31, 1999 would have received the Key Stage 1 assessment in 2006

whereas those born on September 1st 1999 would receive the assessment in 2007. Note that the September
1st cut-o is strictly observed, and that retention and grade skipping are very rare at this age: only 0.28%
of all students are not in their expected cohort.

9

it turns out that the dierencing is not critical. There are no systematic Ramadan eects
for non-Muslims, echoing the placebo results from the prior studies. As we will show the
eects remain even if we only use Muslims who were not exposed to Ramadan as the only
control group as in the previous studies.
Ideally, for our treatment group we would like to identify Muslim students who were in
utero during Ramadan. Since the PLASC does not identify the religion of the student, we in-

stead assign Muslim status to students who report their ethnicity as Pakistani/Bangladeshi.
According to the 2001 Census, 92 percent of Pakistanis and Bangladeshis report that
they are Muslims.

To reduce the scope for measurement error, we use only those Pak-

istani/Bangladeshis who are living in a region (local authority) where at least 90 percent of
13

Pakistani/Bangladeshis with a reported ethnicity are Muslims according to the Census.

We suspect that there is still some residual measurement error since the reported ethnicity
of students is not always constant across years. Figure 2 shows the distribution of Pakistani
and Bangladeshi in England. Areas with high concentrations of Muslims include London
and the areas around Birmingham in the West and around Manchester in the North-West.
For our control group we use Caribbean students since they are a comparable ethnic
minority group. Caribbeans have similar levels of school performance and nearly identical
rates of free school meal status a proxy for socioeconomic status. In Table 1 we show that
the average scores of Caribbeans are 0.20 standard deviations below the national average
compared to -0.36 for our designated Muslim students. About 35% of both groups of students
receive free school meals. This compares to an average rate of free school meals of about
16% for white British students. Although Indians are culturally more similar to Pakistanis
and Bangladeshis, a sizable minority are Muslim and hence they would be a contaminated
control group. Further, Table 1 shows Indian students outperform the national average and
are less likely to receive free school meals.
An issue that arises in classifying Caribbeans is that the ethnicity codes were expanded in
2003 to create a separate category for mixed-race Caribbeans (white and black Caribbean)
in addition to the traditional category of Caribbean.

For our main analysis we have

combined both groups in order to maximize our sample. This leads to a large increase in
the number of Caribbeans starting in 2003. As a robustness check we have also excluded
mixed race Caribbeans and nd similar, though less precise, results. As we discuss later, we
have also run all of our models using white British students as an alternative control group
and nd similar, and much more precisely-estimated eects.

13

This removes only about 1.2% of all Pakistani/Bangladeshis. We also drop any students who report a

mixed ethnicity of White and Bangladeshi or White and Pakistani.

10

3.3 Ramadan Measures
We collected the start dates and end dates for the relevant Ramadans aecting our birth
cohorts. In order to identify whether Ramadan overlapped with the in utero period, we use
one's exact birth date and assume a normal gestation length of 266 days (since conception)
for each individual.

We then create a set of indicator variables to identify when during

gestation Ramadan began. For each of the nine months of pregnancy we generate a separate
variable (e.g. Month 1, Month 2, ..., Month 9) to indicate whether Ramadan began during
that month of pregnancy. In addition, we create a Month 0 variable to capture conception
during Ramadan and early gestation exposure to fasting.

Those whose pregnancies, by

this calculation, do not appear to overlap with Ramadan are further subdivided into two
categories. We classify individuals as probably not exposed if they were conceived within
14 days after Ramadan had ended and certainly not exposed if they were conceived more
than 14 days after Ramadan. In Figure 3 we provide an example of how various pregnancies
would be classied based on the exact date of birth and the timing of Ramadan. Our reliance
on the normal gestation length creates some potential measurement error for most of these
indicators of Ramadan exposure since some pregnancies will be preterm or longer than full

term.

The size of our coecients can be interpreted as the magnitude of fasting's eect only if
all Muslims who were pregnant during a Ramadan chose to fast. Since fasting rates typically

depart from unity, our ITT approach underestimates the treatment eect of fasting and can
be viewed as a lower bound. Our estimates can be rescaled by multiplying by the inverse of
the fasting rate in order to approximate the treatment eect of fasting.

3.4 Specication
Our main specication uses ordinary least squares to run regressions of the Key Stage 1
assessments in math, reading and writing, as well as their rst principal component, on
the Ramadan exposure measures. Since the three subject tests are z -scores, the coecients
can be interpreted as the eect sizes in standard deviation units.

However, the standard

deviation of the rst principal component is 1.58, so the estimated eects for this outcome
should be scaled down by this factor in order to be comparable to the other coecients.
The excluded category is those who are classied as certainly not exposed, so all eects
are relative to this group. Additional controls include month of birth dummies, a dummy

14

Our Month 9 variable captures individuals who were born during Ramadan.

To the extent that the

exact date of birth is measured accurately there should be no misclassication. Similarly, those identied
as certainly not exposed would only be misclassied if the term of gestation exceeded 280 days which is
rare [Kieler et al., 1995]. In that case conception would overlap with the end of Ramadan. We note that as
long as the date of birth is not incorrect, premature births will never be misclassied as not exposed if they
actually were exposed but it is possible that they could be misclassied as exposed even if they weren't.

11

for female, a dummy for Muslims, a dummy for free school meal eligibility and a set of
15

geographic dummies for each Census output area.

To further address concerns about

time trends we also include a cubic in the number of days between the date of birth and
January 1 1960. Standard errors are clustered at the school level. We fully interact each
regressor (except for the geographic xed eects) with a dummy for Muslim. This allows
for example, for separate time trends and seasonal patterns for Muslims and Caribbeans,
(albeit with possibly imperfect seasonal control). The coecients on the Muslim interaction
terms for the Ramadan measures are the main objects of interest. For example, a signicant
negative coecient on the interaction between being Muslim and being in utero during the
rst month of gestation would suggest an eect of fasting that would be over and above
any eect that might be found for Caribbeans due to confounding factors such as residual
seasonality that may remain after the interacted calendar month-of-birth xed eects.
We also estimate the same specication using free school meal eligibility as the dependent
variable to show that there is no selective timing of pregnancies related to socioeconomic
status. Finally, as a placebo treatment, we estimate any prenatal Ramadan eects for
Caribbeans using white British as a control group, where we should not expect to see any
eects. This helps ensure that our results are not driven by any other misspecication of
the model such as any residual seasonal eects that might be correlated with the timing of
Ramadan.

4 Results
4.1 Dierence-in-dierences vs. Caribbeans
We begin by showing our main results in Table 2 where we present the coecients on the
Ramadan measures interacted with an indicator for being Muslim. These show the eects
on Muslims of Ramadan starting in each month of pregnancy compared to Muslims with no
in utero exposure, relative to Caribbeans. The results show consistently signicant negative

eects of exposure in the rst three months of pregnancy. For example, column (1) shows
that Muslim students exposed to start of Ramadan in the rst month of pregnancy have
Key Stage 1 assessments in math that are 0.068 standard deviations lower. Similarly sized
eects are found in the month of conception and the second and third months of pregnancy
and for the same four periods for reading assessments (column 2) and writing assessments
(column 3). The implied eect sizes for the rst principal component of these subjects from
principal components analysis (PCA) shown in column (4), when converted into standard
deviation units, is also very similar. The largest eects appear to be in the third month of

15

Our sample includes 51,187 census output areas.

Output Areas are the base unit for the release of

Census data and are based on common demographic, household and economic characteristics.

12

pregnancy when the eects on math and on the rst principal component are about 0.08
standard deviations.

This accounts for about 20% of the overall test score gap between

Muslims and the national average in these subjects. As we discussed earlier, the fact that
not all pregnant Muslim women observe the fast implies that our estimates should be viewed
as a lower bound. The similarities in the pattern of eects across the outcomes is illustrated
16

in Figure 4 which plots the coecients shown in columns 1 through 4 of Table 2.

Column (5) shows the results on math scores using a specication in which the geographic
xed eects have been omitted.

Comparing columns (1) and (5), we nd the results are

actually a bit stronger once we control for location xed eects, suggesting that our results
aren't driven by geographic dierences. In column (6) we only use Muslim sub-sample and
no longer estimate a dierence in dierence model. In this specication our identication
is based on only the eects of Ramadan exposure relative to other Muslims whose in utero
period did not overlap with Ramadan.

We again nd that months 1 through 3 all show

negative eects that are signicant at the 5 percent level and that those conceived during
Ramadan have scores that are signicantly lower at the 10 percent level.
Table 3 shows the coecients on Caribbean students, our control group. Importantly,
we nd no instances of negative eects of Ramadan exposure on our various outcomes that
17

are quantitatively or statistically meaningful.

This is reassuring since it suggests that the

negative eects on Muslims are not driven by other factors such as residual seasonality that
may be confounded with Ramadan exposure.

4.2 Evidence on Selective Timing of Pregnancies
A crucial assumption for our identication strategy is that there is no systematic selection
with respect to the characteristics of Muslims who conceive relative to the timing of Ramadan. For example, if there were some reason that Muslims of lower socioeconomic status
were more likely to conceive in the three months prior to Ramadan, then this might provide
an alternate explanation for our ndings of strong eects in the rst trimester. A detailed
analysis of selection on observables by Almond and Mazumder [2011] using Michigan natality data found no evidence of selection bias in terms of the timing of pregnancies relative
to Ramadan using variables such as parental education, maternal smoking behavior or a

16

We also nd similar results if we use the original categorical coding of the assessment levels using

ordered probit models or if we run linear probability models with an indicator for attainment of level 2 as
the outcome.

17

We do nd that 3 out of the 44 coecients in columns 1 to 4 of Table 3 show eects that are statistically

signicant at the 5 percent level which is roughly what one might expect to nd purely by chance. However,
all of these are positive eects and none occur in months 1 through 3 where we nd our largest eects on
Muslims. For Muslims, 13 of the 44 coecients in Table 2 are negative and signicant at the 5 percent level
and another 7 are negative and signicant at the 10 percent level. Importantly every coecient for Muslims
in the rst trimester (months 0 to 3) is negative and statistically signicant at either the 5 or 10 percent
level.

13

Medicaid receipt (a proxy for income).

Van Ewijk [2011] nds no dierences in parental

health, income, and assets between Indonesian children by their in utero exposure during
a Ramadan.

Van Ewijk [2011] further shows that estimates of health eects of prenatal

Ramadan exposure on children's health are robust to the inclusion of mother xed eects,
suggesting that any forms of selective timing of pregnancy must have been specic to each
child.
We re-examine the possibility of selective timing of pregnancy with our British educational data by running our statistical model using Free School Meal status (FSM) as a
dependent variable. Free School Meal eligibility is a commonly used proxy for low socioeconomic status (SES) since it is means tested. The results of this exercise are shown in column
(7) of Table 2. We nd that Muslims who were in utero during the rst three months of
pregnancy when Ramadan began the period where we nd consistent eects on achievement
were no more likely to be eligible for FSM. Further looking at months 1 through 9, ve of
the months actually have negative coecients suggesting that Ramadan was associated with
lower rates of FSM, or higher SES.
We do note, however, that Muslims exposed to Ramadan in the seventh month of pregnancy and those who were conceived during Ramadan are slightly more likely to receive
FSM. While it is possible that the latter result could reect some type of actual behavioral
dierence during Ramadan between low and high socioeconomic status Muslims (perhaps
because of dierences in levels of observance or dierences in sexual practices) we are somewhat doubtful of this. One reason for our skepticism is that those who we label as probably
not exposed, many of whom were conceived well after Ramadan ended, have even higher
rates of FSM. It would be surprising if lower socioeconomic status Muslims were more likely
to conceive both during Ramadan and after Ramadan ended, if this was due to a behavioral
dierence associated with Ramadan. Finally, even if it were the case that more low income
Muslim women systematically chose to conceive during Ramadan, this would not explain
the pattern of results we nd of negative eects for those women for whom Ramadan began
during one of the rst three months of pregnancy, and whose conception therefore, preceded
Ramadan.

4.3 Robustness Check Using White British
To benchmark our dierence-in-dierence estimates using an alternative control group, we
have also run the same specication using white British students rather than Caribbeans.
Although this comes at the expense of using an arguably less comparable control group,
it increases the sample size to around 4.6 million observations and thereby provides much
greater precision. The results for the three subject tests as well as for the principal component are plotted in Figure 5. We once again nd that early exposure is associated with lower

14

assessments in all subjects. For example, for those Muslim students for whom Ramadan began in the third month of gestation, math scores are lower by about 0.06 standard deviations
which is similar though somewhat smaller in magnitude than the 0.08 standard deviation
eect when using Caribbeans as the control group. For the rst principal component, the
implied eect size is now about -0.054 in standard deviation units, compared to -0.076 as
implied by the results in Table 2.

4.4 Robustness Check: Placebo Treatment
As an additional check on our identication strategy, we conducted a placebo test by
estimating the same dierence in dierence regression using Caribbeans as the treatment
group and white British as the control group. We would be concerned if we found eects
on the Caribbean group who we know are not observing Ramadan. Any such placebo eects
might suggest that our specication is not adequately dealing with seasonality. The results
are shown in Figure 6. We nd that only 1 out of the 44 coecients is statistically signicant
at the 5 percent level. Further, there does not appear to be any systematic pattern in the
results that would suggest that our rst trimester eects on Muslims are in any way an
artifact of seasonality.

5 Conclusion
The Ramadan fast lasts just one lunar month, yet our results suggest that alterations to
the timing of prenatal nutrition during this brief period potentially has ramications on
lifelong human capital. Most commonly studied childhood determinants of human capital
reect investments that occur over much longer periods of time, may be subject to fade
out, and are much more costly to undertake.

Further, the magnitude of the eects of

prenatal exposure to Ramadan are very similar to the size of the treatment eects of laterlife interventions. Dobbie and Fryer [2011] summarize the eects of successful educational
interventions and the magnitude of their eects on student performance. Charter schools in
New York were found to increase test scores by .09 standard deviations, Teach for America
raised math and reading scores by 0.15 and 0.03 standard deviations (respectively), and Head
Start increased scores on applied problems by .15 standard deviations.

Our lower bound

estimates suggest that fasting in the rst trimester of pregnancy reduces academic scores
by between 0.05 and 0.08 standard deviations. Despite its brevity, exposure to Ramadan
during an especially sensitive developmental period exerts meaningful and persistent eects
on human capital accumulation. This suggests relatively low cost investments in prenatal
nutrition may yield high returns.
We nd that the eects are statistically signicant and largest in the rst three gestation

15

months. While this is consistent with the hypothesized predictions of much of the developmental origins literature, it is possible that some of the gradient in the eect size may be due
to dierential rates of fasting during the course of pregnancy, for which we unfortunately
have no data.

Presumably fasting observance would be highest shortly after conception

when many women do not yet know they are pregnant.

Therefore, our ITT estimates of

rst month exposure are probably closest to fasting's eect. Interestingly, however, our effects appear to rise monotonically over the course of the rst trimester. Indeed, the largest
eects appear to be in the third month of gestation when we speculate that Ramadan would
not be universally observed, suggesting that the eects on cognitive development may be
particularly large at this stage.

Future research that can combine information on fasting

behavior over the course of pregnancy with a credible research design may be able to better
sharpen our understanding of these patterns of eects.
The only previous study to consider the eects of prenatal Ramadan fasting on school age
18

outcomes found no eect [Azizi et al., 2004].

If as we suspect, the human capital eects we

nd are unknown to Muslim parents, postponing the Ramadan fast until after pregnancy
may oer a low cost route to improved outcomes.

The fact that Ramadan fasting alters

the biochemical characteristics of the intra-uterine environment in a way similar to other
restrictions on the timing of prenatal nutrition, suggests that these eects may also generalize
to non-Muslims. Future research should seek design-based approaches to assess the eects
of dieting, meal-skipping (reported by 24% of pregnant mothers in US, see Siega-Riz et al.
[2001]), and nausea and vomiting during early pregnancy, which can all aect the timing
of nutritional intake.

In the case of dieting and meal skipping, these potentially harmful

behaviors tend to be more common early in pregnancy, especially prior to the pregnancy
being recognized, see e.g. Ebrahim et al. [2000]. In addition, future research might consider
the eect of technologies and interventions that enable pregnancies to be recognized earlier
in gestation, and thereby enable behavioral change.
