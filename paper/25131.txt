From Paper to Plastic: Understanding the Impact of eWIC on WIC Recipient Behavior

ABSTRACT
Evidence shows that the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and
Children (WIC) is underutilized. WIC enrolls only sixty percent of eligible persons. Participants
claim only a fraction of available benefits. Researchers suggest that people underutilize WIC
because of the time needed to enroll in and use WIC and because participants may believe that, if
others notice them participating in WIC, community members will stigmatize them. Recently
enacted policies may reduce both time costs and potential for stigma associated with WIC.
Congress mandated that, by 2020, all states disburse WIC benefits through an Electronic Benefits
Transfer (eWIC) system. The eWIC potentially reduces the time required for each transaction and
makes it more difficult to identify beneficiaries. We analyze data on grocery expenditures of
11,887 WIC-participating households in one state over the period it implemented eWIC. We find
that, after beneficiaries began redeeming WIC benefits through eWIC, spending on non-WIC
eligible foods did not change but redemptions of WIC benefits increased.

INTRODUCTION
To deliver food assistance, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has
increasingly used Electronic Benefits Transfer systems (EBT, also referred to as eWIC). Since
June 2004 the USDA has used eWIC to deliver Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
(SNAP) benefits. Partly based on that experience, Congress mandated that, by 2020 all states use
eWIC to disburse WIC benefits. Currently, 26 states have implemented eWIC (USDA 2018a).
Our objective is to understand the economic effects of eWIC on WIC recipient behavior,
specifically benefit redemptions.
In fiscal year 2017 Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and
Children received over $5.5 billion (USDA 2018b) in funding making it the third largest
nutrition assistance program. For reference, 12.5% of the US population participates in the
SNAP program (USDA 2018c). By contrast, approximately 45.4% of all infants, 23.5% of
children (USDA 2018b; US Census Bureau 2018), and 35.8% of pregnant and postpartum
women (Ver Ploeg and Betson 2003) participate in WIC.
The WIC program aims to provide a nutritionally adequate and balanced diet to lowincome pregnant and postpartum women, infants, and children ages 1-4 who are “at nutritional
risk.” By design, and in contrast to the SNAP program, WIC provides specific foods (milk, eggs,
bread, and cereal) in specific quantities. WIC also gives beneficiaries a small cash amount that
they may only spend on fruits and vegetables (cash value vouchers).
Applicants who meet WIC program requirements (state resident, income, and at
nutritional-risk) are eligible for six months of benefits with the possibility of extending benefits
for one or more additional six-month periods. Evidence suggests that WIC staff deem virtually
all applicants to be at nutritional-risk (Bitler, Currie, and Scholz, 2003). A pregnant woman is

3

eligible for benefits during nine months of pregnancy and for at least six months post-partum. If
a woman decides to partially or fully breastfeed her child, she can receive benefits for up to
twelve months after she delivers. WIC eligible children remain eligible until their fifth birthday.
During each six-month period of eligibility, recipients receive benefits in two separate
three-month installments. However, WIC delivers vouchers for specific amounts of food that
recipients may only redeem on a month-by-month basis. They may not redeem three months’
worth of benefits all at once.
The literature presents mixed evidence on whether WIC achieves its nutritional targets.
Studies convincingly suggest that WIC mothers bear children who weigh more at birth (RossinSlater, 2013; Hoynes, Page, and Stevens, 2011; Bitler and Currie, 2005) though some researchers
debate that evidence (Joyce, Gibson, and Colman, 2005; Joyce, Racine, and Yunzal-Butler,
2008). Less robust evidence partially supports hypotheses that WIC participants experience less
food insecurity (Kreider, Pepper, and Roy, 2016; Metallinos et al., 2011; Black et al., 2004),
improves their diet, health (Yen, 2010; Lee and Mackey-Bilaver, 2007) and cognition (Jackson,
2015), and increases children’s iron, potassium and fiber intake (Yen, 2010). Some evidence
hints that older siblings may benefit when younger siblings participate in WIC (Robinson, 2013).
A smaller literature documents that people do not fully exploit the benefits available
under WIC. Researchers estimate that, in 2013, only 60.2 percent of eligible persons enrolled in
WIC (Johnson et al., 2015). Further, in Kentucky, Michigan, and Nevada only 12.6 percent of
WIC recipients redeemed all WIC benefits while 5.3 percent redeem none (Phillips et al., 2014).
Given its recent introduction, there are relatively few studies of whether and how eWIC
affects WIC beneficiary behavior. Meckel (2016) finds that the eWIC system may reduce WIC
participation because it reduces the number of stores that participate in WIC. Qualitative

4

evidence suggests that individual WIC participants shop more frequently under eWIC and that
they view eWIC systems favorably because the transaction is faster and they feel less
embarrassed. (Phillips et al., 2014). An unpublished simulation also suggests that eWIC reduces
perceived stigma (Manchester and Mumford, 2010).
Our study is one of the first to examine whether and how the introduction of eWIC
affects benefit redemption and non-WIC food spending. We use household-level scanner data
from a major grocery store chain in Ohio that track weekly household expenditures on non-WIC
foods and redemptions of WIC foods for households in 56 of 88 Ohio counties. Ohio
implemented eWIC in seven sets of counties between 2014 and 2015. Our sample period, from
the last week of December 2013 through the first week of June 2015, includes six of the seven
implementations. We show that, after eWIC, recipients redeem more WIC benefits. We find no
evidence that eWIC influences how much households spend on non-WIC-eligible foods.
In the remainder of the paper, we provide some background on how WIC recipients
redeemed benefits before and after a county implemented eWIC. We sketch out a set of
hypotheses about how eWIC might alter recipients’ behavior. We then describe our data, sample,
method, and results. Lastly we discuss our results and draw conclusions.

WIC BENEFIT REDEMPTION BEFORE and AFTER eWIC IMPLEMENTATION
Before the state of Ohio introduced eWIC, WIC recipients redeemed benefits with five separate
paper vouchers by following a strict process. At checkout, recipients had to first separate WICeligible food items from other goods. The beneficiary then handed the cashier her paper WIC
vouchers. The cashier manually verified each WIC-eligible item, marked the vouchers, and
informed the WIC beneficiary of any items she could not redeem with WIC benefits. If the

5

cashier identified non-WIC eligible items, the cashier allowed the WIC recipient to return the
items. If she chose to keep them, the clerk included their cost in the total cost of all non-WICeligible purchases. Under paper vouchers, a beneficiary surrenders the voucher to the clerk after
she redeems an item listed on it. If she redeems some but not all of the items on a given paper
voucher, she forfeits the food items she does not redeem.
Within this context, we conceptually model the WIC recipient’s decisions in a manner
consistent with the household production literature spawned by Becker (1965). Specifically,
WIC recipients combine time with other inputs, in this case food, to produce outputs of value to
the household. In this framework, WIC recipients face a multi-dimensional cost constraint they
use to find their utility maximizing food bundle, part of which is covered with WIC benefits. For
this research, we focus on the costs associated with redeeming those benefits.
WIC recipients acquire authorized foods by paying non-market (or shadow) costs of time
and stigma. Time costs include the initial fixed cost required to enroll in the program, time
needed to travel to authorized WIC retailers, and time costs associated with the actual purchasing
process. These latter costs include time needed to learn which foods WIC covers, finding those
exact foods (in the approved quantities), enduring the process of redeeming benefits, and
replacing or returning non-WIC items mistakenly selected to redeem with WIC benefits.
WIC recipients also potentially pay a stigma cost to get WIC authorized items. Recipients
may feel this stigma while referring to WIC authorized food lists when making food selections.
When redeeming benefits with vouchers, they may incur this stigma cost when other shoppers
notice them separating out their WIC foods and handing food vouchers to the cashier. This
stigma cost may increase as fellow shoppers wait additional time in line when the recipient
mistakenly selects a non-WIC food item for redemption with WIC benefits, and the recipient

6

must decide to replace the item with the WIC authorized food or pay for the non-WIC item out
of pocket.
In the case when a WIC recipient does not redeem all benefits on a voucher, she
experiences a kink in her cost constraint. This kink occurs because relative prices of goods for
which she attaches a non-zero value change at the point where she forfeits benefits. For example,
if a recipient chooses to redeem milk but not eggs, though she would have redeemed eggs in a
later trip, the effective “shadow price” of the eggs now includes the value she puts on the eggs
foregone by not redeeming the WIC benefit for eggs. Furthermore, her resources available to buy
other (non-WIC) goods also discontinuously falls.
The use of computer scanners under eWIC changes the benefit redemption process in
ways that can reduce some of the transaction and potential stigma costs WIC recipients face.
Under eWIC, a beneficiary no longer needs to separate her WIC and non-WIC purchases (though
this is still encouraged in Ohio) and the cashier does not need to manually verify each WIC item.
The cashier simply scans the barcodes for all the items, both WIC and non-WIC, and the
computer automatically tallies them separately. Then the recipient swipes her eWIC card (as if it
were a debit card), enters her personal identification number, and the system prints a receipt of
her remaining benefits up to that point. Afterwards, the computer prints out a receipt listing the
eligible WIC items for redemption that were scanned and prompts the beneficiary to authorize
redemption of those benefits. Once the WIC recipient responds affirmatively, the system deducts
the benefits and prints the recipient with the remaining balance, which she pays for out of pocket.
The recipient then receives a receipt with the remaining benefits, along with a standard receipt.
If the recipient mistakenly selects a non-WIC food with the intent to purchase it with
WIC benefits, the recipient may not even notice this before authorizing the transaction. If she

7

does notice the mistake, she may choose to pay for the item out of pocket to avoid either feeling
stigmatized or the time costs of correcting the mistake. But if she chooses to pay for the cost out
of pocket, she can still redeem the intended benefit, and any other unused benefits, at a later
time.
As described here, eWIC reduces or eliminates many of the time and potential stigma
costs associated with redeeming WIC benefits. In addition, the technology removes the potential
kinks in cost constraints by allowing beneficiaries to redeem benefits at any time. We recognize
that eWIC may actually increase shopping frequency, and increase travel costs, as recipients take
advantage of the opportunity to redeem benefits at any time. With the data we have, we are
unable to investigate these implied effects.

EXPECTED EFFECTS of eWIC
Relative to the paper voucher system, we expect eWIC beneficiaries will redeem more of their
WIC benefits – primarily because they have more flexibility about when and how often they
redeem benefits. This hypothesized effect will be even greater if eWIC reduces their perceived
stigma. Note that this predicted effect will be attenuated immediately after a county introduces
eWIC but will grow over the subsequent three months elapse because, during the three months
immediately after a county introduces eWIC, some fraction of beneficiaries will still be using
paper vouchers. They can choose to convert their vouchers to eWIC or wait until they receive
the next three-month installment of benefits. The fraction still using paper vouchers steadily
declines until, at the beginning of the fourth month after the eWIC implementation date, all
beneficiaries use eWIC.

8

The transition to eWIC may also temporarily affect non-WIC expenditures. Under the
paper voucher system, when a WIC recipient mistakenly chooses an item she believes is WIC
eligible, the checkout clerk informs the WIC recipient of the error. This situation has the
potential to make the WIC recipient suffer perceived stigma in addition to what she felt before
when separating out her WIC from non-WIC foods, because the shoppers standing in line behind
her must wait for her to decide what to do. Under the eWIC system, a WIC recipient decides
herself whether or not to call attention to any errors she makes. If she would rather pay the
amount out of pocket instead of facing time or stigma costs, then she will not choose to return
the item. As she becomes more familiar with the new system, we expect her to learn and make
fewer of these types of mistakes.
In summary, we hypothesize that, after a county implements an eWIC system:
1) WIC redemptions will increase;
2) WIC redemptions will increase by successively larger amounts through the paper-toeWIC transition period;
3) Expenditures on non-WIC foods will initially increase, but the magnitude of the increase
may fall over time as recipients learn.
DATA
To measure the effect of eWIC on recipient shopping behavior we make use of two unique data
sets. First, we rely on variation in the staggered implementation of eWIC across counties in Ohio
to identify the effect the transition has on WIC participant purchases. Second, we use household
purchase data that we aggregate to the monthly level to study the dynamic patterns in purchasing
before and after eWIC.
Expenditure Data
9

We use data on weekly household expenditures at one supermarket chain operating in 56
of Ohio’s 88 counties. Through a cooperative agreement, the grocer provided data for 73,331
households that redeemed WIC benefits at least once in a calendar year. These data for WIC
households are part of a larger sample of approximately 6 million households the grocer
maintains as part of their loyalty card shopper program. Households enter and remain in the
sample if at least one member of the household holds a loyalty card, spends a minimum amount
each year, and uses the card on those purchases.
These grocer data track calendar-week (Sunday-Saturday) expenditures on WIC-eligible
and non-WIC-eligible food items in 18 different product categories. The categories are bakery,
deli, deli packaged, floral, fresh prepared, fresh produce, general merchandise, grocery, health
and beauty care, liquor, meat, natural foods, packaged produce, pharmacy, packaged meat,
packaged seafood, seafood, and supplies. Four of the categories – fresh produce, grocery, health
and beauty care (infant formula), and packaged seafood – include WIC eligible food items. We
ignore expenditures on packaged seafood because no household in the sample selected items in
this category. The data also identify whether a household redeems WIC benefits with a paper
voucher or eWIC. In less than 1% of the full sample, the grocer flagged expenditures as WIC
redemptions but did not specify whether recipients used a voucher or EBT. We imputed missing
values of this indicator by assuming beneficiaries in a given county redeemed WIC benefits
using eWIC if their transaction occurred after the county had implemented eWIC.
Since the grocer did not provide WIC redemptions on milk, eggs, and cheese, which we
refer to as dairy, we imputed them. We do so by subtracting WIC redemptions on all other
categories from total WIC redemptions. Since all other WIC authorized foods appear in the other
product categories, we are confident the dairy category only includes milk, eggs, and cheese.

10

Note that in weeks when a household has no record of purchasing food or redeeming
benefits we cannot determine whether the household: 1) bought nothing that week; 2) bought all
their groceries at a different store; or 3) did not use their loyalty card for non-WIC eligible items
and redeemed no WIC benefits. In these cases we assume households spend nothing and assign
missing redemption and expenditure values with zeros.
To smooth the data, we aggregate each household’s weekly expenditures up to monthly
spending. Consequently, a month may include either four or five full weeks. To measure
expenditures over the same number of days, we scale expenditures in months with five weeks by
0.8. Our sample period includes expenditures over seventeen full months, beginning in January
2014 and ending in May 2015.
The weekly data identify the county of the store at which the household shops. When we
aggregate the data, we retain the modal county identifier for households that shop in a given
county three out of four (or five) weeks in a calendar month. If, in a given month, a household
shops two weeks in one county and two weeks in a different county, we randomly assign one of
those county identifiers to the household (N=195 households).
In Table 1, we summarize monthly food expenditures of the average household in each
county or group of counties that implemented eWIC on a different date. The first column reports
the average of total expenditures. The second and third columns report average expenditures on
non-WIC-eligible and WIC-eligible food items. The last column shows WIC redemptions share
of total expenditures. We observe that WIC-eligible food items share of weekly food
expenditures is 0.15. Standard deviations are wide enough to suggest that mean expenditures did
significantly vary by date of eWIC implementation.
eWIC Implementation Data in Ohio

11

The Ohio Department of Health implemented eWIC over the course of a year. Officials
first piloted eWIC programs in five counties across three dates in 2014: July 14 (one county),
August 4 (one county), and October 19 (three counties). After this pilot phase, Ohio rolled out
eWIC to remaining counties on January 25, 2015 (eight counties), March 23, 2015 (sixteen
counties), May 1, 2015 (twenty-seven counties), and July 1, 2015 (thirty-two counties).
Figure 1 shows a map of all 88 Ohio counties, color-coded to indicate the date on which the Ohio
WIC agency implemented eWIC in each county.
In Table 2, we summarize the demographic characteristics of residents of counties we
include and exclude from our sample. The average excluded county has a bigger population with
higher median household income than the average included county. Median income of
households receiving SNAP benefits differ little across the two groups. In Appendix Tables
A1.a and A1.b, (available on request), we compare demographics across counties that
implemented EBT on a particular date. Population demographics (e.g. the percentage of families
receiving welfare income) differ across the sample and non-sample counties.
Estimation Sample
Households are in the sample if they hold a loyalty shopper card, spend a minimum
amount at the grocer, and redeem WIC benefits a least once a year. We restrict the sample to
households that redeem WIC benefits at our grocer an average of once a month over the study
period. This rule excludes WIC households that infrequently redeem their WIC benefits at the
participating grocer. Our final sample includes 11,887 households and 91,049 shopping months.

EMPIRICAL SPECIFICATION

12

We specify our empirical models to exploit variation in the eWIC rollout schedule. Under the
assumption that WIC-eligible people do not move to a particular county because they want to get
(or avoid) an EBT card, this rollout schedule exogenously assigns the date on which WIC
households begin to use eWIC. We model the introduction of the eWIC system as an event (see
Hoynes, Schanzenbach, and Almond, 2016). With this method we model how eWIC changes
beneficiaries’ shopping behavior in any given month relative to their expenditures in a baseline
(reference) month. Following similar studies, we define the baseline month as the month before
a county implements the EBT system (see Hoynes and Schazenbach, 2009; Hoynes, Page, and
Stevens, 2011). Robustness checks show that results do not change when we define the baseline
month to be the month when a county implements eWIC. Those results are available on request.
We aim to test whether a household changes its shopping behavior before and after a
county introduces EBT. We specify a model with separate month indicators for each of the five
months before and five months after the baseline month. The coefficients on these indicators
represent differences in expenditures in each month relative to expenditures in the baseline
month. This flexible specification allows us to test whether WIC recipients anticipate and adjust
to the introduction of EBT (perhaps because the local agency advertises it) and, as noted above,
for the possibility that a given household still uses paper vouchers up to three months after a
county implements the EBT system. We test the hypotheses that WIC households respond to
EBT by redeeming more benefits and/or spending more on non-WIC food items in the postbaseline months. We also test whether the effects change over time.
Formally, we specify our empirical model as:
𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼0 + ∑5𝑘𝑘=1 𝛼𝛼𝑘𝑘 𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + ∑5𝑗𝑗=1 𝛼𝛼5+𝑗𝑗 𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡+𝑗𝑗 + 𝝉𝝉𝒕𝒕 + 𝒉𝒉𝒊𝒊 + 𝜈𝜈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

(1)

13

where 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 measures how much household i in county c spends in month t. We model spending
on WIC and non-WIC eligible items, food categorized as general grocery foods, all produce,
dairy, and infant formula, and the share of WIC redemptions relative to food expenditures.
The variables 𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 (k=1-5) and 𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡+𝑗𝑗 (j=1-5) represent five pre- and five post-eWIC

month indicators. We include a vector of calendar year-month fixed effects, 𝝉𝝉𝒕𝒕 . The vector
includes, for example, a fixed effect for January 2014 that differs from the fixed effect for

January 2015. To capture unobserved time-invariant household variation we include a vector of
household fixed effects, 𝒉𝒉𝒊𝒊 . We cluster standard errors at the county level because the state of

Ohio introduced eWIC on different dates in different counties and households are nested within
the counties. The final term 𝜈𝜈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an error term.

In the Appendix (available on request) we also report results when we estimate equation

(1) on subsamples of our data. These subsamples include: a) a balanced panel of households; b)
households from the non-Pilot phase counties only; c) households that redeemed WIC infant
formula benefits; d) household that never redeemed WIC infant formula benefits; e) households
from all counties, including counties that did not implement eWIC in our sample period. We use
Stata 13 for all of our analyses.

RESULTS
We report estimation results for WIC redemptions in Table 3 and in Figure 2 plot the event
month coefficients from column 1 of Table 3 along with 95% confidence interval bars. Results
suggest that, in the months before a county implements eWIC, a household’s WIC redemptions
do not differ from redemptions in the baseline month. After a county implements eWIC,
households increase WIC redemptions, and the increase trends upwards across the event months.

14

Relative to baseline, total WIC redemptions steadily increase by $6.24, $9.35, and $11.50 in
post-baseline months 3, 4, and 5 respectively. All estimates statistically differ from expenditures
in the baseline month. Further, the $11.50 in expenditures in post-baseline month 5 statistically
differs from the $6.24 increase observed in post-baseline month 3.
When we decompose WIC redemptions by food category, Table 3 reveals that the higher
redemptions post eWIC occur in WIC-eligible grocery and dairy items. Redemptions for grocery
foods, such as cereal, beans, and peanut butter are higher than baseline month expenditures by
$1.45, $2.51, and $2.44 in post-baseline months 3, 4, and 5 respectively. Redemptions in dairy
increase by $1.31, $3.50, and $6.72 in post-baseline months 3, 4, and 5 respectively. The extra
WIC redemptions are reflected in results for the WIC share of expenditures. Relative to baseline
the share of expenditures that WIC comprises increases steadily by 0.0085, 0.0195, and 0.026 in
post-baseline months 3, 4, and 5 respectively.
Results in Table 3 suggest that WIC households do not systematically change WIC
redemptions for produce or infant formula after eWIC. We estimate higher WIC redemptions for
infant formula (relative to the baseline month) in the fourth pre-baseline (by $2.67) and fifth
post-baseline (by $2.78) months. Both estimated differences statistically differ from zero. Joint
tests of significance for all event month coefficients suggest these two larger coefficients for
infant formula are not mere chance.
Table 3 also shows that, relative to the baseline month, WIC beneficiaries redeem fewer
benefits on general grocery items in pre-baseline months four and five and on produce in prebaseline months two, four, and five. Furthermore, relative to the baseline month, WIC
redemptions for dairy product are lower in all five pre-baseline months (by $0.53, $0.27, $0.45,
$0.19, and $.26 in pre-baseline months 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 respectively) and $0.28 in post-baseline

15

month 1. These differences are statistically different from the baseline month redemptions with
p<.05 except for pre-baseline months 4 and 1 where p<.10. We also observe increase in WIC
share of total food expenditures after the transition to eWIC, suggesting no changes in non-WIC
expenditures in the same period.
We report estimation results for non-WIC redemptions in Table 4 and in Figure 3 plot the
event month coefficients from column 1 of Table 3 along with 95% confidence interval bars.
WIC beneficiaries spend $13.22, $16.20, $14.36, and $10.41 less, than they do in the baseline
month, on all non-WIC food items in pre-eWIC months 5, 4, 3, and 2 respectively. The
reduction in pre-eWIC spending is mostly in produce and health/beauty care product categories.
We find that, after a county implements eWIC, households do not change their total nonWIC food expenditures but we observe evidence of greater spending within certain product
categories. Specifically, WIC households spend more on produce, up to $2.22 more in month 5,
in the months after their county implements the eWIC system. Households also spend more on
non-WIC-eligible items in the health and beauty care category (which includes infant formula) in
post-eWIC months 4 and 5, but point estimates are not statistically significant.
Robustness and Specification tests
Results from the series of robustness and specification tests (results available on request)
we list at the end of the section titled Empirical Specification largely follow the pattern of results
in Tables 3 and 4. Results are most similar for households that redeem benefits for infant formula
at least once during the sample period. We also find that the month we choose to be the baseline
month does not affect our results.

DISCUSSION

16

Our results suggest that eWIC dynamically changes how WIC households redeem WIC benefits
and spend money on non-WIC food items before and after implementation. Overall results
suggest that eWIC induces households to redeem more WIC benefits and this effect increases
over the five post-eWIC months we observe. This pattern is consistent with the transition phase
of eWIC systems. Notably, in the three month period after a county implements the eWIC
system some WIC recipients still redeem benefits with paper vouchers.
At the same time, we also observe dynamic patterns that clearly have nothing to do with
the process of phasing out paper vouchers and phasing in eWIC cards. In the months leading up
to eWIC, WIC households in non-pilot counties redeem more benefits on general grocery items
and infant formula. We are not certain of the mechanisms that drive these results but it is
possible that as eWIC rolled out across counties WIC staff in pilot counties interacted with WIC
recipients differently than WIC staff in counties that implemented eWIC as part of the “regular”
rollout. Understanding the true mechanisms requires additional research and detailed data we
currently lack, such as variation in outreach campaigns and/or eWIC informational materials.
The most consistent result we observe is post-eWIC increases in the dairy category.
After a county implements the eWIC system, WIC beneficiaries redeem a greater amount of
WIC benefits for dairy items. One possible explanation of this pattern is that the eWIC system
lowers both transaction costs and perceived stigma costs. Under eWIC WIC households have
more flexibility to redeem benefits more frequently and in smaller quantities without losing other
items previously lumped together on a single paper voucher. Although we cannot test the
hypothesis with our data, we also observe that families with young children probably (want to)
buy dairy products more frequently. The increase in WIC redemptions on WIC-eligible dairy
products post-eWIC is at least consistent with this logic.

17

We also note that eWIC systems are supposed to allow recipients to redeem their cashvalue benefits for produce at any time during the month. In the early stages of eWIC,
beneficiaries had to redeem less than the cash-value for produce to redeem any benefits at all.
For example, if a woman selected $12 in groceries the eWIC system would not redeem any of
her benefits because the amount exceeded the $10 in cash value for produce. Given this technical
problem, it makes sense that after a county implements the eWIC system, households decrease
the amount of WIC-eligible produce benefits that they redeem. This explanation is also
consistent with the result that non-WIC produce expenditures are statistically positive four and
five months after implementation (Table 5).
We recognize limitations in our research along several fronts. First, our data come from
one grocer in Ohio and thus only include shoppers who participate in the grocer’s loyalty card
program, track household expenditures/redemptions not for specific items (except for infant
formula) but only broader food categories, and cover a specific time period that does not include
all eWIC implementation dates in Ohio. The first two of these limitations serve as a caution that
ours is a selected sample. It also highlights that our data do not track WIC redemptions and nonWIC expenditures of our sample households at other stores. Consequently, we cannot (and do
not) claim that our results reflect the behavior we would observe among a randomly drawn WIC
recipient in Ohio. The latter data limitation restricts our results to fairly short-run effects. With
our data we cannot estimate effects over longer periods of time.
We also recognize there are potentially alternative explanations for our results we cannot
and do not test here. For example, using an identification strategy similar to ours, Meckel (2016)
finds that the introduction of eWIC in Texas reduced the number of stores that participated in
WIC, increased prices of non-WIC foods in smaller stores, and results in a net social welfare

18

loss. With our data we cannot test or control for such effects. Given the market implications of
funneling more resources to fewer stores, this is an important area for future research.
Some of our results may also be an artifact of the period over which we observe
expenditures and the particular counties in each implementation group. The households living in
Ohio counties that implemented eWIC system in January and March 2015 are primarily
Appalachian counties. It is possible that our results are driven by this specific set of WIC
recipients. Our limited time frame in the data does not allow us to explore this further.
Lastly, our study also suffers standard data limitations. We observe limited information
about the demographic characteristics of our WIC households. This severely limits our ability to
identify which WIC bundle the household may receive. Furthermore, we are unable to study the
effect eWIC has on shopping frequency, which is an interesting are for future work.
Despite the limitations in our data, we find consistent evidence that eWIC increases
redemptions in WIC benefits. This increase suggests that the implementation of eWIC will have
consequential effects on WIC redemptions and household budgets. Although we do not observe
it in our sample, the literature estimates that the average WIC recipient redeems only 85 percent
of the benefits she is awarded. Results in Table 3 suggest that by the fifth month post-eWIC,
WIC recipients increase WIC redemptions, relative to baseline, by $11.50. This increase
represents almost 20 percent of mean WIC redemptions (see Table 2) and suggests that WIC
recipients will redeem almost all of benefits under eWIC. Further, because the eWIC system
induces households to redeem more of their WIC benefits, eWIC systems may expand poorer
households’ disposable income and should relieve more of their financial constraints.
As eWIC expands to all states and WIC recipients enjoy a less complicated procedure for
redeeming benefits, states can also work with grocers to provide greater convenience to

19

beneficiaries. For example, Wal-Mart recently piloted a program that lets SNAP recipients
redeem their benefits when they use Wal-Mart’s curbside grocery pickup program. 1 While
shoppers still must enter the store to use their SNAP benefits for curb-side pick-up orders, they
still enjoy the ease of shopping from home and an even greater chance to reduce stigma they may
perceive from other shoppers. A high return on investment for food assistance programs such as
WIC (Lentz and Barrett 2013) provides compelling evidence that states consider following suit.
State WIC programs might also consider working with vendors to allow WIC recipients
redeem benefits through the retailer’s food delivery programs. Since many WIC recipients have
unreliable private transportation or rely on public systems, such an innovation could also
increase uptake and use of WIC benefits. Of course, before state WIC agencies adopt such
policies, they must understand whether and how store access and transportation costs affect
uptake and benefit redemption (see Grindal et al., 2016) and when determining the efficacy of
the program policy makers and program administrators should carefully consider how they
measure impacts (Gundersen, Jolliffe, and Tiehen, 2009). There are multiple opportunities to
leverage the benefits of eWIC to provide more favorable shopping conditions for those receiving
benefits. Our research provides a unique view into WIC recipient behavior policy makers use to
consider additional means to improve the WIC experience, and highlights many opportunities for
additional research in this area.
