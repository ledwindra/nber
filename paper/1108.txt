April 1983
Wage Flexibility and Openness

Abstract

This paper analyzes the degree of short—run, real wage flexibility in a

two—sector economy under floating rates. This is done by deriving optimal

wage indexation in a contracting framework. We find that the more closed the
economy, the lower the degree of wage indexation. As a result, output will
fluctuate less around its desired level in a more closed economy. These
findings further imply that a given unexpected monetary shock will cause a
smaller output shock in a more open economy, whereas a given real shock will
induce a smaller output shock in a more closed economy.

I. Introduction
Recent experience with flexible exchange rates suggests the existence of
cross—country differences in the flexibility of real wages and in adjustment

pattern to various shocks. For example, changes in the exchange rate appear
to affect the price level in Europe, whereas they affect the level of exports

and imports in the United States. The apparent sensitivity of wages to prices
and exchange rates has led various authors to consider how wage indexation is

related to the underlying economic structure.' Their findings suggest that
different degrees of wage indexation generate different degrees of short—run
real wage rigidity, which in turn implies different adjustment patterns to a

given shock. Thus, understanding the determinants of optimal wage indexation
might explain the existence of cross—country differences in adjustment
patterns.

The purpose of this paper is to focus attention on the role of openness

in explaining the degree of short—run real wage rigidity. The analysis
investigates how optimal wage Indexation is affected by the degree to which

domestic output is exposed to the prices of internationally traded goods. A
useful analytical simplification is to consider the case of a two—sector

economy in which we dichotomize between traded and non—traded goods. In such
a model, the country is taken as small in the traded sector (i.e. it is a

price taker for traded goods) and large in the non—traded sector. Thus, there
is one relative price determined endogenously——that of traded to non—traded

goods. For a given relative price, the exchange rate sets the price level. A
larger share of traded goods implies a larger exposure to international
prices, diminishing the economic relevance of the endogenous determination of

the relative price of traded to non—traded goods. This paper investigates how
the endogenous determination of the above relative price affects wage

indexation. This is done by applying the wage indexation approach formulated
by Gray [19761. This approach was used by Flood and Marion [19821 in the
context of a one sector open economy, and the present paper extends their
contribution to the case of a two—sector economy.

Section 2 describes the model. Section 3 derives the optimal wage
indexation and conducts the comparative statics. Section 4 summarizes the

findings, and provides concluding remarks. The Appendix summarizes the
notation used in the paper.

2. The Model

under floating rates and perfect capital mobility. Consumers are assumed to

period t is demand—determined, and depends on the realized real wage. These
models also allow for partial indexation,

which may be set according to some

optimizing criteria. For a recent application of the contracting approach in
an open economy see Flood and Marion (1982) and Marston (1982).

that m, v, i, p are uncorrelated random variables, generated by white noise

As a reference point, let us start with the •non—stochastic equilibrium,'
i.e., the equilibrium in the economy if the value of all the random variables

is zero (m = v = 1 = p = 0). Suppose that prices in such an equilibrium
are given by

= S = 1. Let us denote by lower—case variables the

percentage deviation of the upper—case variable from its value in the non—

stochastic equilibrium, i.e., for a variable X, x = (X — X0)/X0 where X0 is
the value of X if all random shocks are zero. To simplify notation, we delete

the time index. Thus (xt, xt÷k) are replaced by (x, x+k). To facilitate
discussion, it is useful to take a log—linear approximation of the model

its non—stochastic equilibrium,

Notice that h(1—b) in eq. 16 corresponds to the Phillips curve slope. A
lower degree of wage indexation enhances the output effects of unexpected
price changes.

Equilibrium in the money market is given by:

Notice that an unexpected price level rise (p > o) induces an expectation that prices will fall next period by p, implying that the real interest

rate is i ÷ p .

Eq. 17 and 18 provides the short—run equilibrium conditions

which imply that:

(19)

p —

p=

+ p*)/(On• c + a + O• h).

A rise in the foreign interest rate, or a transitory foreign price
increase leads to a higher real interest rate, which reduces current demand

for both goods. The market for non—traded goods clears continuously, thus the

—7--

relative price of non—traded goods should drop. A larger substitutability of
the two goods in consumption (a) or production (h) reduces the needed
adjustment of relative prices.

3. Optimal Indexation and Openness
To be able to drive some normative aspects of indexation, it is useful to
consider as a benchmark the real output attained in a fully flexible

economy. Let us denote by x the value of x in a fully flexible economy.
Following Gray we adapt the loss function4:

L =

E(y

—

y)

Where E0 stands for the unconditional expectation operator. The loss
function indicates that we wish to choose the wage indexation scheme so as to

minimize deviations from output's fully flexible level (i).

In

a flexible economy, the labor market clearing condition implies that

Optimal indexation is chosen so as to make the real wage in a contracting

economy "closest" to real wage in a flexible economy. Its value, derived from

Openness can be measured either by the share of traded goods (0) or by
the substitutability in consumption (a) and production (h) of traded and non—

traded goods. An increase in openness, as measured by any of the above
parameters will increase optimal wage indexation. Thus, we expect a lower
degree of real wage flexibility in a more open economy. Notice also that the
degree of wage indexation decreases with the ratio of productivity variance to
the variance of the other shocks.

The above results can be interpreted in the following way: There are two
type of shocks with opposing effects on indexation——productivity shocks and

all the other shocks. We would like to increase wages when there is a

positive productivity shock (see eq. 21). When such a shock occurs, it is
associated with a lower price level which accommodates the increase in the

demand for money. In such a case we would like to have a low degree of wage

indexation. We would like to index fully for all the other shocks. Thus,
there are opposing forces at work in setting the desired degree of indexation,

Any increase in either i or p will increase the real interest rate,
causing a drop in demand for both goods. Because the market for non—traded
goods should clear all the time, the implication is that the relative price of

non—traded goods should drop (p —

p < 0) to clear excess supply in non—

traded goods. This adjustment also cushions the initial shock, because it

reduces the real interest rate by O(p —

p).

The force of this cushion

effect is related to the degree of openness. The more closed the economy, the
more significant the above effect.6 This adjustment reduces the economic

In a more open economy, higher wage indexation increases real wage rigidity

and deviations in output from its target level. This is consistent with the
notion that endogenous relative price adjustment has stabilizing effects on
output.

From eq. 17 and 18 we get that prices and exchange rate are given by:

Because reduced openness implies lower wage indexation, we can deduce
from eq. 28—29 that closeness dampens the exchange rate and price level
response to monetary, productivity and foreign interest rate shocks.

Finally, it is of interest to analyze how openness affects output

adjustment to various unexpected shocks. For an unexpected monetary shock (m)
we find that

(30)

h(1—b) + k+1

Because in a more open economy we get higher wage indexation (b), a
monetary shock will cause higher output deviation from the target level in a

more closed economy. On the other hand, for an unexpected productivity

increase (v). We get

Thus, a productivity shock will cause a smaller output deviation from the

target in a more closed economy. In this sense, the more closed the economy,
the more productivity shocks are cushioned and monetary shocks magnified.

4. Summary and Concluding Remarks
This paper has analyzed the degree of short—run real wage rigidity for a
two—sector economy under floating rates by deriving optimal wage indexation in

a contracting framework. It has shown that the more closed the economy, the
lower the degree of optimal wage indexation. This occurs because endogenous
adjustment of relative prices mitigates the effects of exogenous real interest

rate shocks. As a result, output will fluctuate less around its desired level

in a more closed economy. In this sense, closeness in the economy increases
the flexibiltiy of its adjustment to various shocKs.7 The extra flexibility

is reflected also in a lower short—run real wage rigidity. This implies also
that a given unexpected monetary shock will cause a smaller output shock in a
more open economy, whereas a given real shock will induce smaller output shock
in a more closed economy.

The above results should not be interpreted as suggesting that there are

benefits to be derived from policies that reduce openness. Cross—country
differences in openness might be the result of differences in absolute size,
transportation costs to other markets and other exogenously given para-

meters. The welfare effects of endogenous policies that affect openness, like
commercial policies, should be treated explicitly in any framework that wishes

to derive "optimal" openness. This analysis suggests a new dimension in
differentiating a tariff from a quota. For a small country, under certainty,
each tariff rate is equivalent to a certain quota. In the case of uncertainty
and a frictional labor market, a country might prefer a quota to a certainty

equivalent tariff. This is because the imposition of an import quota (in
contrast with the imposition of an import tariff) may be viewed as
transforming a traded good whose relative price is determined in world markets
into a non—traded good whose relative price is determined in the domestic

—12—

market. Consequently, the imposition of a quota instead of a tariff allows a
small country to benefit from the stabilizing effects of endogenous price
adjustments.

Comments

1.

See Gray (1976), Flood and Marion (1982) and Marston (1982).

2.

To make the model manageable it is assumed that in the short run,
output/labor elasticities are equal for both sectors. Allowing for
different elasticities have no systematic effect on the results.

3.

It is assumed that the variances of the shocks are small enough to make
such approximations useful.

4.

This is also the loss function applied by Flood and Marion [19821.

5.

This is because we expect the relative price to adjust upward in the next
period. The role of relative price adjustment for the determination of
real interest rate has been studied in different contexts by Bruno (1976)
and Dornbusch (1983).
