    "abstract": "\n\nConventional models of production under uncertainty specify that output is produced in fixed proportions across states of nature. I investigate a representation of technology that allows firms to transform output from one state to another. I allow the firm to choose the distribution of its random productivity from a convex set of such distributions, described by a limit on a moment of productivity scaled by a natural productivity shock. The model produces a simple discount factor linked to productivity, which can be used to price a wide variety of assets, without regard to preferences.\n\n",
