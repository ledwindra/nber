    "abstract": "\n\nWe examine how a sovereign\u2019s ability to borrow abroad affects the country\u2019s growth and steady state consumption, assuming that the government is both myopic and self-interested. Surprisingly, government myopia can increase a country\u2019s access to external borrowing. In turn, access to borrowing can extend the government\u2019s effective horizon as the government\u2019s ability to borrow hinges on it convincing creditors they will be repaid, which gives it a stake in incentivizing private production and savings despite its self-interest. In a high-saving country, the lengthening of the government\u2019s effective horizon can incentivize it to tax less, resulting in a \u201cgrowth boost\", with higher steady-state household consumption than if it could not borrow. However, in a country that saves little, the government may engage in more repressive policies to enhance its debt capacity and spending. This could lead to a \u201cgrowth trap\u201d where household steady-state consumption is lower than if the government had no access to external borrowing. We discuss the effectiveness of alternative debt policies, including declaring the sovereign\u2019s debt \u201codious\u201d, debt relief, and debt ceilings.\n\n",
