    "abstract": "\n\nWe construct an endogenous growth model with random interactions where \ufb01rms are subject to distortions. The TFP distribution evolves endogenously as \ufb01rms seek to upgrade their technology over time either by innovating or by imitating other \ufb01rms. We use the model to quantify the e\ufb00ects of misallocation on TFP growth in emerging economies. We structurally estimate the stationary state of the dynamic model targeting moments of the empirical distribution of R&D and TFP growth in China during the period 2007\u201312. The estimated model \ufb01ts the Chinese data well. We compare the estimates with those obtained using data for Taiwan and perform counterfactuals to study the e\ufb00ect of alternative policies. R&D misallocation has a large e\ufb00ect on TFP growth.\n\n",
