Large Employers Are More Cyclically Sensitive

NBER Working Paper No. 14740
February 2009
JEL No. E24,E32,J23,J63
ABSTRACT
We provide new evidence that large firms or establishments are more sensitive than small ones to
business cycle conditions. Larger employers shed proportionally more jobs in recessions and create
more of their new jobs late in expansions, both in gross and net terms. We employ a variety of measures
of relative employment growth, employer size and classification by size, and a variety of U.S. datasets,
both repeated cross-sections and job flows with employer longitudinal information, starting in the
mid 1970's and now spanning four business cycles. We revisit two statistical fallacies, the Regression
and Reclassification biases, and show empirically that they are quantitatively modest given our focus
on relative cyclical behavior. The differential growth rate of employment between large (>1000 employees)
and small (<50) firms varies by about 5% over the business cycle, and is strongly negatively correlated
with the unemployment rate. This pattern occurs within, not across broad industries, regions and states,
and is robust to different treatments of entry and exit. It appears to be partly driven by excess (mass)
layoffs by large employers during and just after recessions, and by excess poaching by large employers
late in expansions. We find the same qualitative pattern in longitudinal censuses of employers from
Denmark and Brazil, and in other countries. Finally, we sketch a simple firm-ladder model of turnover
that can shed light on these facts, and that we analyze in detail in companion papers.

Introduction

We present evidence that recessions are times when large employers are hit particularly
hard and lose a disproportionate share of their employment, while small employers, as a
group, hold up better. This pattern continues well into the subsequent expansion, as long as
unemployment remains above trend, and slowly reverses as the unemployment rate declines.
Late in aggregate expansions, large employers expand especially fast, both in absolute and
relative terms.
Specifically, we establish five facts:
1. Large employers destroy proportionally more jobs during and after recessions and create
proportionally more jobs late in expansions (relative to small employers), both in gross
and net terms.
2. Employers that are initially larger have a much more cyclical one-year ahead growth
rate of employment.
3. The higher cyclical sensitivity of large employers holds principally within industries
and within States, not between those units.
4. Reclassification of employers into larger size classes during an aggregate expansion
plays a quantitatively negligible role in explaining the higher cyclical sensitivity of
large employers.
5. This phenomenon is not unique to the U.S., and we observe it in several countries of
different sizes and stages of development.
We also find evidence, more limited in its time scope, that these patterns are related to
excess layoffs by large employers in recessions, and to excess job-to-job quits towards large
employers in tight labor markets.
In order to establish these facts, we exploit a variety of datasets on employment stocks
and flows by size of the employer: repeated cross-sections (distribution of employment among
firm size classes); semi-aggregate statistics containing limited longitudinal information, such
tabulations of gross and net job flows by initial or end-of-period employer size, divided by
initial, average or end-of-period employment; employer panels with full longitudinal information. The data often break down the separate contributions of continuing, entering, and
closing establishments and firms, firms of different age, and are broken down by industry
and location. Particularly useful proved the new Census Bureau’s Business Dynamic Statistics (BDS), as well as matched employer-employee datasets from Denmark and Brazil. The
1

different datasets allow us to address, and relieve concerns about, the effects of two potential
sources of bias. The Regression Bias is a well-known fallacy that creates the illusion of a
negative size/growth relationship. We are not interested in this sign but in how it changes
over the business cycle, and we show that this bias is not relevant in this context. The
Reclassification Bias generates the illusion of our Fact #2, as employers are reclassified into
larger size bins as the economy grows. Longitudinal data allow us to assess and circumvent
this problem, which we find to be quantitatively negligible (Fact #4).
While this is, by and large, a ‘facts’ paper, ours is by no means a theory-free exercise. In
fact, our approach to the data is guided and motivated by our companion theoretical work
in Moscarini and Postel Vinay (2008), [MPV08], and Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2009),
[MPV09]. After laying out the facts, we sketch a simple model of firm dynamics, entirely
based on hiring and employment turnover frictions, which can simply and parsimoniously
explain the new facts. Our findings in this and in our companion papers suggest the following
view of how business cycles propagate. Early in an expansion, firms hire mostly and cheaply
from unemployment. As the reservoir of unemployment dries out, more productive firms find
it profitable to start raising wages to raid workers from less productive competitors. Workers
quit mostly from small, less productive, low-paying firms to large, high-paying firms. The
growth in the employment of large firms is fueled by the stock of employment at small firms,
which takes some time to replenish after a recession. Hence, employment at small firms
grows faster and peaks earlier than at large firms.
We now discuss several implications of our findings. The size/growth relationship of
employers is the subject of a vast literature originating from Gibrat’s (1931) seminal contribution. Firm size is measured by either employment (as in Gibrat’s original work) or,
more often, assets, capital, or sales. This literature, however, typically ignores business
cycle effects. Our findings suggest that firm employment size may predict its growth, but
the sign of this relationship may flip depending on cyclical conditions. In particular, the
relationship tends to be negative (or less positive) when unemployment is high and positive
(or less negative) when it is low. Omitting cyclical indicators may lead to conclude that, on
average, these cyclical effects wash out and size does not predict subsequent growth, which
is Gibrat’s law. This is typically captured by a zero estimate in a growth-size regression.
Adding an interaction term between the detrended unemployment rate and initial size in the
regression is likely to invalidate this conclusion. Verifying this conjecture is a task on our
current agenda.
The new business cycle fact that we uncover is reminiscent of Okun’s (1973) idea of
Cyclical Upgrading (see Bils and McLaughlin, 2001 for a recent new interpretation), a crossindustry pattern whereby labor reallocates itself from low- to high-paying industries in
2

booms, and vice versa in recessions. Instead, the phenomena that we emphasize in this
section hold within industries and not across. This is surely worth noticing, although it does
not pose a particular problem for our proposed interpretation, which seems to apply equally
well to many industries. It is in fact natural to expect that, if workers have any significant
attachment to an industry, for example because of their industry-specific occupation, then
they should upgrade within industries more than across.
Our facts appear to plainly contradict a well-established set of facts regarding the sensitivity of small firms to cyclical conditions and monetary shocks. In a very influential paper,
Gertler and Gilchrist (1994) present evidence that small firms, which they argue are more
credit constrained, are more sensitive to Romer and Romer (1989) monetary policy shocks.
Gertler and Gilchrist use the Quarterly Financial Report for Manufacturing Corporations
(QFR), since 1958, which is confined to manufacturing. They define size in terms of nominal
sales, raising the issue of industry-specific price indexes within manufacturing. The data
lack longitudinal links, leading them to make an ingenious yet ad hoc correction to avoid
the Reclassification Bias. Even then, their conclusion that small firms are more cyclically
sensitive holds, if any, for Romer shocks, which are notoriously controversial, and not for
NBER-dated recessions. Of the six recessions in their sample period, only in 1970 one sees
a clear collapse in the growth rate of sales at small firms relative to large ones (their Fig.
I), and the opposite occurs in 1982. The other four episodes appear fairly neutral.1 Chari,
Christiano and Kehoe (2007) also notice the distinction between Romer dates and NBER
dates in the Gertler and Gilchrist QFR time series, and extend them to the early 2000s.
They focus on the growth rate of firm sales by size of a firm’s assets, and do not find a
differential behavior of large and small firms around NBER recessions, but rather a much
higher sensitivity of small firms to Romer shocks. Our measure of performance and size
is employment, not sales and capital, because we are interested in job creation and inputs
more generally, and we have employment growth data that are immune from Reclassification
Bias. All in all, we believe that the picture of the whole economy over NBER-dated cycles
for the post-war period, after controlling for Reclassification, is likely to be much closer to
our conclusions that to Gertler and Gilchrist’s. In the period we cover, since the mid-1970s,
our facts about firm size and growth are very firmly established.
The conventional wisdom and oft-heard slogan that “small businesses are the engine of
job creation” finds some empirical support in our data for periods of high unemployment,
recessions and their aftermaths, which is presumably when jobs are more needed. This
1
Sharpe (1994) replicates their findings for employment growth, by initial size defined in terms of net
capital. He uses the NBER Manufacturing Panel from Compustat. As we will show later, in the full
Compustat panel comprising all industries, over a longer time period, our pattern of differential growth rate
by initial size still emerges at NBER-dated business cycles.

3

statement clearly fails in tight labor markets, when job creation is taken over by large
employers. The Regression Bias is not a severe problem because we focus on cyclical, rather
than average, patterns of job creation by firm size.
Finally, our findings may explain at least in part the discrepancy between household-based
(Current Population Survey, CPS) and payroll-based (Current Employment Statistics, CES)
measures of aggregate employment at monthly frequency. The former surveys about 50,000
households with 140,000 individuals, and generates the unemployment rate, the latter about
160,000 firms with 400,000 establishments, and generates official employment figures. Both
are run by the BLS. The CES/CPS ratio of employment measures is strongly procyclical,
very much like the share of large employers or the relative growth rate of large vs. small
employers.2 This discrepancy in levels and especially cyclical behavior between the two
surveys of employment is still a mystery and has defied all attempts for an explanation. None
of these explanations is based on the evolution of the firm size distribution. If the CES sample
is skewed towards large employers and misses small firms, that the CPS household survey is
able to capture, then CES employment will reflect the cyclical patterns of the employment
of large employers. When unemployment is low, large employers, which are better captured
by CES, appear to grow very fast. When unemployment is high, the reduction in CES
employment is very severe, in part because it misses small employers that we have shown to
be less cyclically sensitive, as a group. Given the well-know difficulties that both the BLS
and the Census Bureau encounter in tracking small employers, our new finding that large
employers are more cyclically sensitive appears to offer a promising avenue to resolve the
puzzle.3 More work needs to be done in this direction.
In Section 2 we present our definitions and methodology, and discuss two potential biases
that can affect our results, and how we cope with them. In Section 3 we present evidence
drawn from business micro data that contain a longitudinal dimension and are immune
from the Reclassification Bias, and we document our main finding. In Section 4 we present
auxiliary evidence from repeated cross-sections of employment distribution by size of the
employer. In Section 5 we shed some light on the new patterns by introducing evidence on
worker flows, specifically job-to-job quits and layoffs, by size of the firms involved in the
transition. Section 6 presents evidence from several other countries. Section 7 illustrates a
simple model of firm size dynamics. Concluding remarks follow.

Definitions and Methodological Issues

The main purpose of this paper is to show that large employers are more cyclically sensitive.
In this section we lay out the definitions and methodology that we adopt to establish this
fact. In the following sections we apply them to various datasets.
Our notion of size is employment, not capital, assets, or sales. This choice is motivated by
our previous theoretical work (MPV08, MPV09), which identifies in a firm’s productivity and
employment level the two main determinants of an optimally posted wage. Since productivity
is hard to measure, and proposed measures are highly correlated with employment size, in
this paper we focus on the latter. By “employers” we mean either firms or establishments,
depending on the dataset at hand.
In order to measure relative cyclical sensitivity of employers of different sizes, we compute
the difference in employment growth rates between large and small employers, each taken as
a group. Employers of different sizes may add systematically more or less jobs, an issue of
great conceptual confusion and political importance. By taking the difference in growth rates
and focusing on its fluctuations, rather than on its level, we sidestep this issue of relative
contributions of small businesses to job creation. We will provide conceptual details and
empirical evidence on this point.
Our measure of the economy’s business cycle conditions is the detrended civilian unemployment rate. Again, this is motivated by our theoretical work. We correlate this statistics
with the differential employment growth rate by employer size described above, within the
relevant geographical unit. We also plot the two series with NBER-dated cyclical peaks and
troughs, episodes which are very concentrated in time and fail to capture the slack in labor
markets that persists long after a recession. Nonetheless, we document that the last three
NBER-dated recessions, and probably also the current one, are clearly times when large
employers fare worse than small employers.
As we have learned from the literatures on economic growth across countries and on firm
size growth, specifically Gibrat’s Law (Sutton, 1997), the size/growth relationship is rife with
statistical fallacies. Great care must be taken in defining the timing of observation of size
and growth for individual employers. Does size refer to the period before observing growth,
after growth, an average of the two? Our ideal measure of employer size is one that is not
contaminated by subsequent growth. That is, we would like to interpret employer size as a
predictor of its subsequent growth, and in particular how this predictive power depends on
aggregate economic conditions. One statistical fallacy is sample selection, in that the sample
is not representative of the entire population of interest but is skewed towards employers
that are particularly large or small at the end of the sample. This is not an issue for us as we

5

will mostly exploit either censuses or representative samples of employers. A more serious
issue is mean reversion in size.

2.1

The Regression Bias

Let Lit denote the number of employees working for employer i at (discrete observation) time
t, and define a weighted-average size between t − 1 and t:
(α)

Lit−1 = α (Lit , Lit−1 ) · Lit + [1 − α (Lit , Lit−1 )] Lit−1
Here α : N2 → [0, 1] is the weight on size “after the fact”, and 1 − α (Lit , Lit−1 ) on initial
size. This is a weighting function that can depend on both numbers.
Let the weighted growth rate
(α)

git =

Lit − Lit−1
(α)

Lit−1

.

If employer size is mean-reverting, then small employers will tend to grow more than
large ones, as they all converge back to a long run middle ground. This generates the
illusion of a negative size/growth relationship if one uses the conventional measure of growth
(0)
rate git = Lit /Lit−1 − 1.
(1)

An alternative is to divide growth by eventual size and use git = 1 − Lit−1 /Lit , but
here the contamination of growth with size is quite strong. As we will see, for our purposes
α = 1 is probably much more problematic than α = 0, as it gives rise to another issue, the
Reclassification Bias, on which we elaborate below.
(1/2)
A middle ground, (see e.g. Davis et. al. 1996) is to use git . That is, the base for the
growth rate between times t − 1 and t is the average of employment at t − 1 and t. This
reduces the mean reversion and Reclassification problems, and has the added value of being
well defined both for entrants, who have Lit−1 = 0 < Lit , and closing employers, who have
Lit−1 > 0 = Lit .
(α)
Let L > L > 0 two integers that define “large” employers (Li ≥ L) and “small”
(α)

employers (Li ≤ L). Let the growth rate between t − 1 and t of employment at all
employers that are classified as large at time s ≤ t
P
(Lit − Lit−1 )
(α′ ,α)
gs,t,LARGE

=

(α′ )
i:Lis ≥L

P
(α)

(α)

Lit−1

i:Lis ≥L

Notice that, using the weighting α′ , we can choose the size class over which to compute
net job creation (the numerator) by either initial, average, or eventual size observed at any
6

given date s < t. This initial date could be fixed once and for all with longitudinal data,
or re-assigned every period, either before growth occurs (s = t − 1) or after (s = t). Also,
we can assign the base by which to divide job creation, the denominator, independently of
the numerator, with the weighting function α, which can differ from α′ . Again, this allows
employment to be either initial, average, or eventual size, at the same time s. Similarly for
(α′ ,α)

(α)

every size class, including the smallest gs,t,SM ALL for Li ≤ L.
We are interested in the relative growth rate by size class, defined as the difference in
growth rates between large and small employers
(α′ ,α)

∆gs,t

(α′ ,α)

(α′ ,α)

= gs,t,LARGE − gs,t,SM ALL

and in particular how it correlates with the business cycle conditions at t − 1.
(α′ ,α)
Whether mean reversion affects also the cyclicality of this relative growth rate ∆gs,t
is questionable, and depends on the specific statistical model of firm growth implied by the
underlying structural model. At any rate, to err on the side of safety, in some datasets
(0,0)

(0,1/2)

we use both ∆gt−1,t , which is differential growth between initial size classes, and ∆gt−1,t ,
differential growth between employers classified by their initial size but where the growth
rates are computed dividing net JC by average employment over the period. We will show
that the cyclical behavior of these two measures is essentially the same, suggesting that mean
(0,0)
reversion is not a problem for our purposes. With longitudinal data, we compute ∆gt0 ,t ,
where t0 is the time when the dataset begins, for many years t after t0 , when the effects of
mean reversion would have presumably washed out. As we will see, our empirical results are
robust.

2.2

The Reclassification Bias
(1,α)

Consider ∆gt−1,t , which is relative growth between t − 1 and t of employers classified by
their size at t. If the economy grows, and all employers with it, while the size cutoffs L > L
remain time-invariant, employers tend to grow in size with the economy and to jump into
higher and higher bins. It then appears that more and more job creation is attributed to
larger size classes, and this differential growth rate is more likely to be positive. Conversely
when the economy shrinks. This is a bias that produces the illusion of procyclical relative
growth by size, precisely the fact that we aim to document.
In one of the datasets that we exploit, the Census Bureau’s Business Dynamic Statistics,
P
we know employment growth for a size class j by either initial size,
(Lit − Lit−1 ),
i:Lit−1 ∈[Lj ,Lj+1 )

or final size. We also observe employment shares of size classes, whose growth rates we can
compare over time. Employment shares suffer from an even more obvious reclassification
7

problem. When using the three methods, we find that the results are similar, suggesting
that neither bias changes our results qualitatively.
An alternative method of attribution of growth to size class is followed by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics in computing quarterly Job Creation (JC) and Job Destruction (JD) rates
presented in the Business Employment Dynamics dataset, that we exploit and illustrate
below. Recall that JC is the addition of employment positions at all units that expand,
and vice versa, so JC−JD is net job creation. The BLS “Dynamic allocation” method even
changes class assignments at infra-quarterly frequency for firms crossing the line between
two size classes. For example, if firm i has Lit−1 = 7, Lit = 15, then, of the 8 jobs created on
net, 2 are attributed to the size class [5,9] and 6 to the size class [10,19]. So the weighting

function α′ is α̃ = Lit − Lj(i),t / (Lit − Lit−1 ) where Lj(i),t is the size class cutoff that falls in

(Lit−1 , Lit ), if indeed the firm jumps size class, otherwise it is just α′ = 0. The denominator
(1/2)
in the published BED job flows rate is the average Lit−1 , so the relative growth rate obtained
by subtracting their JD rate from their JC rate for large and small classes is approximately
(α̃,1/2)

∆gt−1,t .
This method is also potentially vulnerable to the Reclassification Bias, both in the numerator (dynamic allocation) and the denominator (average employment). We obtained
from the BLS also employment by size in each period, so we can correct the latter problem,
potentially incurring into mean reversion. Once again, we find little difference in the results.
We also use fully longitudinal business micro data, Compustat for the U.S. public companies (a selected sample) and censuses of Danish and Brazilian employers, where we can fix
size class for each employer once and for all at the beginning of the sample t0 and compute
(0,0)
∆gt0 ,t . This takes care not only of mean reversion but, even more strongly, of Reclassification, as employers never change size class, even after one or two decades. We find that initial
size predicts growth many many years later, in a way that depends on cyclical conditions.

2.3

Employment Shares by Size Class

The easiest data to obtain are repeated cross-sections of employment shares of size classes.
That is, if we only know
P
Lit
ejt =

i:Lit ∈[Lj ,Lj+1 )

P

Lit

i

which is the conventional definition of the share of employment at time t working at employers of size in class j, then the change in ejt is an estimate of employer growth for size
class j. When small firms grow faster, their share rises. However, as small employers gain
size, they are reclassified into larger size classes, so repeated cross-sections are subject to
8

Reclassification Bias. Specifically, consider the following decomposition:
P

The growth rate of the employment share of a given size class j has thus been decomposed
(0)
into the sum of three terms: gjt , reflecting growth of firms that were initially (i.e. at date
t − 1) in size class j, minus a normalization by aggregate employment growth gt , which drops
out when taking differences in growth rates across size classes, plus a third term reflecting
the contribution of employers that either enter or exit size class j between dates t − 1 and
t. Omission of that third term, which amounts to ignoring changes in the composition of
size classes, is the source of the Reclassification Bias: that term would only equal zero if the
identity of employers in a given size class did not change, so all growth and decline occurred
without leaving a size class.
Equation (1) clearly shows that the growth rate of employment shares only approximates
(0)
gjt up to the Reclassification Bias. Nevertheless, we will also present evidence based on
employment shares for two reasons. First, data on employment shares by size classes are
relatively easy to come by in many countries and over reasonably long time periods. Second,
richer (and scarcer) data sets that allow to fix the composition of size classes over two
consecutive periods also allow to compute growth rates of employment shares, which provides
a way to gauge the magnitude of the Reclassification Bias. Our results suggest that it is
small.
9

An example. Four firms, A through D, are observed at two consecutive dates, t − 1 and
t. Their employment counts are:
Firm
A
B
C
D
t − 1 36 44 353 1690
t
48 1566 18 723
Suppose the data are presented and organized in three size classes, [1 − 49], [50 − 999],
[1000, ∞) employees. The first class is “small”, the last is “large”. Then the growth rate of
firms classified by initial size is (48 − 36 + 1566 − 44) / (36 + 44) = 1917% for the small class,
(723 − 1690) /1690 = −57.2% for the large, the large minus small difference is −1974%. If we
classify them by average size, the growth rate is (48-36)/36=33.3% for the small class, as only
firm A has average size in the small category, again −57.2% for the large class, difference
−90.5%. If we apply BLS dynamic size allocation, the growth rate of the small class is
2 (48 − 36 + 49 − 44 + 18 − 50) / (48 + 36 + 44 + 49 + 18 + 50) = −11.7% and for the large
class it is 2 (1566 − 1000 + 999 − 1690) / (1566 + 1000 + 1690 + 999) = −4.75%, difference
6.9%. Finally, the employment shares of the small and large class are (resp.) 3% and 79%
at t − 1 and 2.8% and 66.5% at t, so they both decrease, but the share of large firms declines
by much more. Qualitatively, all methods except dynamic allocation suggest that small
firms are doing relatively better, a pattern that we uncover in recessions. Quantitatively, the
results vary widely, but the example is intentionally extreme.

2.4

Entry and Exit: Firms vs. Establishments

Most firms enter at the bottom of the size distribution in the dataset, and the contribution
of entry to net JC typically declines by size. For establishments these patterns are similar
but weaker, because existing firms open establishments of all sizes. A natural question to
ask is whether the higher cyclical sensitivity of large employers is due entirely or in part to
entry.
The datasets at our disposal are organized at different levels. If the dataset contains
information on job flows and size either at the firm or at the establishment level, then one
natural question is whether we want to include entering and exiting employers from the
computation of relative growth rates.
There is no compelling reason to exclude exiting employers if we know their initial size
class, as their job destruction should definitely be imputed to that class. But we will provide
some evidence with and without exiting employers, to check whether the relative growth
performance over business cycles is driven by different patterns of exit (extensive margin) or
net JC at continuing employers (intensive margin) across size classes.
10

For entrants, the main issue is the attribution of their first growth to initial size, which
is zero by definition. Even in longitudinal datasets, where we are able to classify JC and JD
by initial size, for entrants this attribution is done necessarily by their eventual size class
(the one they have when first observed), ruling out a size class “0”. So the Reclassification
Bias is unavoidable for such entrants, and may work in the opposite direction: if entry is
very procyclical and most entrants are small when first observed, then the contribution of
small employers to employment growth will appear to be more procyclical, going against
our stylized fact. Therefore, we present evidence with and without entry. If we fix employer
sizes once and for all at some initial date, then necessarily we exclude subsequent entrants
and we focus on a sample of continuing employers.
A special issue is raised by the Census BDS dataset, where size refers to the parent
company, but the entry/exit/continuing status by which job flows are broken down is that
of each establishment the firm owns. For example, we find JD between years t − 1 and t
of all closing establishments owned by firms of either initial (at t − 1) or final (at t) size
in the same employment size class [500 − 999]. It is possible that an existing firm decides
to open or close establishments, while, by definition, an entering firm owns only entering
establishments and a firm that is shutting down is closing all of its establishments.
Here we define “firm count” to be the situation where we subtract from both net JC and
(0)

initial employment of an initial-size (Lit−1 ) class the job growth of firms that were of age 0
at t − 1, that is, firms that entered between t − 1 and t and are reported as having an “initial
(0)
(0)
size” Lit−1 equal to their post-entry size Lit . The reason is that the “initial size” of these
entrants in BDS is in fact their final one, that they reach after entering. This convention
introduces a Reclassification Bias both in the numerator (net JC) and the denominator
(0,0)

(initial employment) of ∆gs,t . We denote the firm-count adjusted growth rate differential
(0,0)
by ∆e
gs,t . In the “firm count”, the addition of new jobs by a firm of size, say, 700, which
opens a new establishment is entirely attributed to size class [500 − 999], because the firm
existed before in that class, although the establishment did not. We define “establishment
count” the situation where we subtract from both numerator and denominator the net JC
of new establishments. This excludes both new firms and new establishments of existing
firms. The first, firm count is our main focus, and establishment count is just to check
robustness and investigate how much of the firm count pattern is driven just by entry of new
establishments.

2.5

Large and Small Employers

Our definition of a “large” and “small” employer is necessarily arbitrary, but guided by a few
considerations. First, if the size classes in the data refer to establishments, then we choose
11

what appears to be fairly reasonable cutoffs, either 20 or 50 employees as upper bounds for
small establishments and 500 employees as lower bound for large ones, which is also often
the largest cutoff available in the data.
If the size classes in the data are organized at the firm level (total employment of the
firm), sometimes the highest cutoff in the data partition is as large as 10,000 employees.
Whenever possible we proceed as follows. Consider firm size class j characterized by cutoffs
[Lj , Lj+1 ), for example [1,4] employees, [500,999] etc. Let sj denote the average number of
employees per establishment among all establishments that are owned by firms in size class
[Lj , Lj+1 − 1]. Clearly, sj /Lj+1 < 1, because by definition no firm in size class j has more
than Lj+1 − 1 workers, and no firm can be smaller than any establishment it owns. If all (or
most) firms in a size class are mono-establishment, then sj /Lj ≥ 1, and we call these firms
“small”. If instead most firms in a size class have multiple establishments, then the firm’s
labor force is distributed among many locations, and the average size of these establishments
is smaller than that of the parent firm, which must be the case if in particular sj /Lj < 1. We
call “large” the firms that belong to size classes that satisfy the last inequality. Presumably,
most single-establishment firms do not have a Human Resource department and do most of
their hiring in house, while multi-establishment large firms have a HR department. So it is
plausible that the former have a harder time than the latter plucking employees from other
firms, and have to rely more on the unemployment pool. This differential source of hiring,
unemployment for smaller firms and poaching for larger firms, is the core of our theoretical
explanation for the patterns that we document in this paper (MPV08, MPV09). Hence, we
try to present the data in a way that is congruent with our theory, distinguishing between
small, single-establishment firms that hire mostly from unemployment and large firms that
own multiple large establishments and rely more on poaching (we will also present direct
evidence on that).
Finally, when we use less aggregate data and compute relative employment growth, say
by sector, we compute sector-specific cutoffs by considering, among the size classes available
in the data partition, the bins that are closest to the first and fourth quartiles of the average
distribution of employment over a long time period.

2.6

Cyclical Indicators and Detrending

As mentioned, our preferred cyclical indicator is the civilian unemployment rate, that we
detrend over the post-war period and then correlate with the relative
 firm-count-adjusted

(0,0)

growth rate by size one period ahead. So our main statistics is corr ∆e
gs,t , udetr
t−1 . As we
showed in MPV08, using the employment/population ratio instead makes little difference,
as participation has no clear cyclical pattern.
12

From datasets of repeated cross-sections, the employment distribution by size of the
employer, we detrend the growth rates of employment shares, as we find they have significant
long term movements. This raises the issue of detrending method. We use a Hodrick Prescott
filter. Following Shimer (2005) we use a high smoothing parameter for unemployment (105
at quarterly frequency). For shares’ growth rates, we find that a high smoothing parameter
is also necessary so that the trend loses obvious cyclical fluctuations. Fitting a linear trend
makes little difference in this case.4

Evidence from the Business Dynamic Statistics (BDS)
The BDS Dataset

The primary source of information on the identity, location, employment, sales, payroll, industry, of all U.S. businesses is the Census Bureau’s Business Register (BR), a.k.a. Standard
Statistical Establishment List (SSEL). For establishments in the BR, information is updated
annually with the Company Organization Survey. The list of establishments in the BR is
updated at every quinquennial Economic Census.5 Establishments in the BR can be linked
up to the firm level using the Employer Identification Number (EIN) assigned by Internal
Revenue Service. County Business Patterns (CBP) are semi-aggregate statistics from the
BR publicly available annually in 1977-2006. They report number of employees in the week
that includes March 12 of each year, payroll in the calendar year to date and over the entire
previous 12 months, and number of establishments, all by size of the parent company (in
number of employees, one of nine size classes), by industry, state and county.
Starting in December 2008, the Census Bureau has made publicly available a set of
semi-aggregate statistics from the Business Register, under the name of Business Dynamic
Statistics. BDS covers approximately 98% of U.S. employment, so it is a fairly comprehensive
picture, not a survey. BDS contains information on establishment-level employment stocks
and job flows, for continuing, entering, and exiting establishments, at annual frequency for
4

The Census publishes County Business Patterns aggregate statistics that include the number of firms, but
only starting in 1989. We find that, in 1989-2006, employment has been migrating towards larger companies.
The average size of the U.S. firm has risen from 17.7 to 19.91 employees. In the BLS Business Employment
Dynamics, average firm size increased from 20.7 to 22.1 employees in 1992:III-2008:I. An inspection of the
entire time series reveals that these are not purely cyclical effects. To the best of our knowledge, this
observation is new. Because larger firms are less typically volatile, this shifting composition of the universe
of U.S. employers might in part explain the simultaneous decline in business volatility, documented by Davis
et al. (2008a) without controlling for size composition.

the 1977-2006 period, broken down by location and industry of the establishment, and by
age and size of the parent firm. To obtain this size, the Census aggregates employment
at all establishments (the original unit of observation) owned by the same firm, according
to various criteria, mainly Employer Identification Number. Two notions of firm size are
available in BDS: the size of the firm at the end of the observation year, after the job flows
have taken place, and the size of the firm before the flows are measured, the “initial firm
size”, which is zero for entrants. These two allow us to avoid the Reclassification Bias and
to calculate employment growth by initial size of the employer, as well as to assess whether
the Regression Bias matters for cyclical patterns.6
More specifically, we calculate the growth rate of employment in a size class as the ratio
between net job creation — namely gross Job Creation (JC) minus gross Job Destruction
(JD) — over the period [March of year t − 1, March of year t], and a measure of employment. Everything is classified by a measure of initial firm size, as of March of year t − 1.
After computing growth, firms are reclassified into their new size classes, and their new size
becomes their initial size for the following period, March of year t to March of year t + 1. As
discussed in Section 2, we consider the following two alternative definitions of employment:
either initial employment at t − 1 or the arithmetic average of employment between t − 1
and t. When using all establishments, the two notions of employment yield almost identical
results, so we will report them only for the former. When distinguishing between continuing
and other establishments, in the next section, the choice of the latter definition becomes
mandatory. Notice that gross JC excludes, by definition, exiting establishments, because it
is the sum of all employment gains at establishments that grow in size, and an exiting one
declines in size.
As explained earlier, in the firm count our notion of gross (and net) JC refers only to
pre-existing firms, either continuing or exiting. These are not to be confused with continuing
and exiting establishments, whose gross job flows are provided directly in the BDS, but are
not the appropriate measures for our classification by size of the firm. That is, we include in
net JC that of new establishments of existing firms (age>0), because the initial size of those
pre-existing firms was well defined and correctly attributed. Obviously, we also include in
JD both continuing and exiting establishments, because they existed at time t − 1 and had
a correct firm size attached.
To define small and large firms, we choose employment size classes 1-49 and 1000+.
Besides being a reasonable choice, we do so after looking at Table 1, where we report the ratio
6
In previous work (MPV08) we used another set of semi-aggregated statistics from the Census Bureau
which contains some longitudinal information, the Business Information Tracking Series. This is now by and
large also subsumed in time and scope by BDS.

sj /Lj , discussed earlier, by size classes j. We find that the ratio is greater than 1, suggesting
a prevalence of mono-establishment firms, for firms of sizes up to 49, and less than 1 for
larger firms. The ratio nearly vanishes for very large firms, implying that these are almost
exclusively firms that own very many establishments. Indeed, the average establishment size
stabilizes around 60 employees for all firms of total size above 500.

The Aggregate Picture

In Figure 1 we plot the employment growth rates of firms that have initially less than 50 and
more than 1000 employees, starting in 1979, with NBER peaks and troughs. Large firms
suffer much more from the 1983 and 2001 recessions. The growth rate of large firms is smaller
than that of small firms in the first few years after each of the three NBER troughs, including
1992-1995, and larger in the few years preceding each of the three NBER peaks. The 1991
recession appears to differ, but this is mostly a time aggregation effect, as large firms do fare
worse in 1992 (and beyond). The NBER trough was in March 1991, which is exactly the
month to which BDS observations refer for the year. In fact, if we compute two-year growth
rates 1990-1992, the difference disappears, and reverses in 1990-1993, when large firms once
again grow less. This picture corroborates only in part the common wisdom that small
businesses are the engine of (net) job creation. As mentioned earlier, this statement has
been amply criticized (see for example Davis et al., 1996) as subject to Galton’s regression
fallacy, which is known to generate a negative size-growth relationship. While this fallacy is
almost certain to affect the relative levels of net JC by initial size also in our BDS data, it
15

is less likely to have a clear impact on their relative cyclical patterns, as this would require
that idiosyncratic, firm-level shocks become much more mean-reverting in aggregate slumps,
which is fairly implausible. At any rate, small firms appear to create more jobs as a fraction
of their employment only when unemployment is high (which is, arguably, when jobs are
most needed). In terms of absolute number of jobs added, large firms dominate at nearly all
times, because they employ a larger fraction of employment to begin with.
Figure 2 decomposes the differential (initially large minus small firms) net JC rates of
Figure 1 into differential gross JC and JD rates. The action is all on the JD side in 1983,
namely, large employers that contracted shed a much larger proportion of their payroll than
contracting small firms. Less dramatic but qualitatively similar is the pattern after the 1991
recession, with a lag of a year or so. In 2001 both JC and JD contribute to the worse
performance of large employers. In between recessions, it is a surge in gross JC by large
firms late in expansions to account for their better performance in those phases, including
again in 2005-2006. Overall, these figures indicate the following:
Fact 1. Large employers destroy proportionally more jobs during and after recessions and create proportionally more jobs late in expansions (relative to small
employers), both in gross and net terms.
To better visualize the cyclical effect, we take the difference in growth rates between (initially) large and small firms. If this differential growth rate is procyclical, as we will find,
then large firms are more cyclically sensitive: they shed proportionally more of their employment in recessions and gain more in booms. Because our underlying theoretical hypothesis
emphasizes the role of unemployment and labor market tightness as a cyclical indicator, and
because NBER dates may be marking cyclical slumps and recoveries too narrowly, Figure
3 reports the relative growth (net JC) rate against the detrended one-year lagged civilian
unemployment rate. We lag unemployment as we envision it as predetermined and contributing to cause growth of employment between t − 1 and t. Here is one central finding of
this paper: as visually clear and confirmed by the -0.6 correlation,
Fact 2. Employers that are initially larger have a much more cyclical one-year
ahead growth rate of employment.
An alternative way of cutting the data and focusing on recession is an “episode analysis”. For
each of the three complete business cycles in the time span, we renormalize time at 0 in the
corresponding NBER trough year, and plot it in a worm graph for several years before and
after that trough, without any prior detrending. We center the 1989-1995 episode in 1992,
although the trough was in March 1991, because our 1991 datapoint refers to employment

18

Before we move on to a more thorough analysis of the higher cyclical sensitivity of large
employers (the basic fact listed as Fact 2 above), we should point out the following two issues
about the BDS data. First, while BDS begins in 1977 (that is, with job flows between 1976
and 1977), it shows some troubling discrepancies with comparable, well-proven datasets in
the first two years, 1977 and 1978. In particular, net JC in BDS in 1977-1978 is 2% higher in
BDS than in the Census Bureau County Business Pattern (CBP) data.7 Afterwards, the two
series (BDS and CBP) more or less coincide. This anomaly is reflected in Figure 5, where we
plot the differential employment growth rate (between initially large and small firms) against
the unemployment rate, both detrended. The behavior of the growth rate is quite unusual
in 1977-1978, suggesting serious data issues of unknown nature. Because CBP is a true and
tested dataset while BDS is a new resource that is currently undergoing some revisions, but
is immune from reclassification, we begin our analysis in 1979, since when CBP and BDS
coincide. Fortunately, 1977 and 1978 are not recession years, and we lose little in terms of
cyclical variability in the economy.
Second, all the evidence presented in this subsection was constructed from BDS data
based on “firm counts”, as defined in Subsection 2.4, meaning that entering firms were
excluded from the JC count, while entering establishments created within continuing firms
were kept in. An alternate option is to use data based on “establishment counts” (again,
see Subsection 2.4), which exclude all new establishments from the JC count. Differences
between the two options are generally minor, as exemplified in Figure 6, which replicates
Figure 3 using the establishment count.
We now dig deeper and check whether the basic Fact 2 that we uncover, that initially
larger firms have more cyclically sensitive employment, holds within or across geographical
locations, industries and age of the firm. One important proviso is that in BDS the state and
industry refer to the establishment, and the initial size to the parent company. It is of course
impossible to attribute a state and industry to most large firms that have establishments in
many states and industries. These firms, though, will weigh more because their many and
diverse establishments will be all attributed to the large firm size category, wherever they
are and whatever they produce. Unfortunately, cross-tabulations by two or three of such
criteria, such as net JC by initial firm size, within each industry and each state, is not usable
because too many observations are suppressed for confidentiality reasons. We can, however,
perform the analysis within each of these categories, one at a time, in addition to initial firm
size. We begin with industries and continue with geographical units.
7
Although CBP is based on the same basic source data as BDS, differences in how the source data
are processed lead to differences in the published statistics. For details, see the BDS technical note available at www.ces.census.gov/docs/bds/BDS Technical%20Note 102008-1.doc, in which the discrepancies
between BDS and comparable data sets are also discussed.

Industry Patterns

One natural question is whether the more pronounced cyclical sensitivity of large employers
just reflects a larger cyclical sensitivity of sectors, like manufacturing, that have aboveaverage firm and establishment size. That is, our main finding may be due to a composition
effect. We would like to emphasize that, even if true, this fact would not diminish the novelty
and interest of our finding, although it may appear less surprising in light of what we already
know about the firm size and cyclical sensitivity of different sectors. But it turns out that
the higher cyclical sensitivity of large employers is, by and large, a phenomenon that occurs
within, and not between, industries.

Table 2: Industry-level correlations between average unemployment over past year and differential firm growth, based on firm counts
We maintain our classification in nine broad sectors, which is reasonably consistent
through the changeover from SIC to NAICS in 1998.8 In Figure 7 we plot again the differential growth rate of (initially) large minus small firms in each broad sector against the
civilian unemployment rate, both detrended.9 The within-industry variability of the growth
rate differential is now much larger and swamps visually that of the unemployment rate.
Nonetheless, the pattern emerges also within most sectors, including the larger ones. In
Table 2, we report the correlations, which are all negative.

One slightly puzzling piece of information on industry coverage in the Economic Census, which is
as mentioned the source of the BR, CBP and BDS data every five years, is in the following document:
www.census.gov/prod/ec02/ec02-00r-hist.pdf#page=171,. “The 1992 Economic Census covered retail
trade; wholesale trade; service industries; transportation, communications, and utilities; finance, insurance,
and real estate; construction industries, manufactures, and mineral industries; and the TIU.S.. [...] By including coverage of financial, insurance, real estate industries, communications, and utilities, the 1992 census
marked the most significant expansion of the census in half a century. [...] Altogether, the 1992 Economic
Census covered approximately 95 new industries, expanding coverage to approximately 98 percent of the
nations economic activity. [Coverage of the 1987 Economic Census was approximately 75 percent of the
nation’s economic activity.]”
9
The small and large firm cutoffs are set here to <50 and >500 employees for all industries. Similar plots
using the first and third quantiles of the average (over the entire period) firm size distribution within each
sector as cutoffs — to allow differentiation of sectors that have exceedingly high average establishment size,
such as manufacturing, from much of the rest of the economy — are available on request, and draw a very
similar picture.

Geographical Patterns

We associate to each Census division and U.S. state the corresponding local civilian unemployment rate from the BLS, and correlate the differential firm (large minus small) growth
rate and the detrended local unemployment rate. Figure 9 reports the time series of firm
size differential growth rates and detrended unemployment rates within each U.S. Census
division. The correlations are reported in Table 3. Table 4 reports the same correlations for
all U.S. states. Both the figure and the tables show clearly that the phenomenon that we
identify takes place within states and regions, and it is not driven by employment moving
from locations with small firms to locations with large firms in a boom, and vice versa in
recessions.
At this point we can summarize the findings of this and the previous Subsections in the

Firm Age Rather than Size

Recent work on business micro data (e.g. Foster et al., 2008) as well established theories of
firm dynamics (Jovanovic, 1982) point to age as a major predictor of firm behavior. Older
firms are much less volatile, productive, and growing, conditional on survival, than younger

Fig. 10: Differential growth, based on firm age
Figure 10 plots the differential growth rate of initially (the year before) old and young
firms (old minus young) against the detrended unemployment rate. Two aspects of the
data emerge clearly. First, heterogeneity by age over the cycle is very large, as unemployment fluctuations are now barely visible. Second, older firms are hit hardest by recessions.
Interestingly, the relative growth rate by initial firm age leads the business cycle.

Business Employment Dynamics (BED)

A different source of information on the distribution of employment by employer size is available from the Business Employment Dynamics program at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
This program collects information accruing from the States’ unemployment insurance programs. The dataset only begins in 1992, but its frequency is quarterly. As the name suggests,
the BED is primarily a dataset of job flows. Although the classification is dynamic, thus still
subject to the Reclassification Bias (see Section 2), the small bias found in BDS (documented
26

below in Section 4) suggests that valuable information is contained also in BED’s flows by
reclassified size. The BED has the dual advantage over the BDS of a quarterly frequency

and also of including the first quarter of 2008, thus a new cyclical trough in 2007:Q4.

Fig. 11: Net job creation rates
Figure 11 plots the net JC rate of large and small firms, according to the usual size cutoffs,
and NBER dates.10 The higher cyclical volatility of large firms jumps out. In Figure 12 we
take the difference in these growth rates and plot it against the detrended unemployment
rate. The two series mirror each other, correlation −0.76. Figure 13 decomposes the net
flows of Figure 11 into differential gross JC and differential JD, large minus small firms.
Clearly, excess JC by large employers accounts for their faster net growth in the late 1990s,
while a spike in JD by large employers explains their slump in the 2001 recession. The
message from these BLS data is the same that we obtained in the Census BDS data.

Compustat

Longitudinal links in BDS are valid only for one year, on a rolling basis. Proper longitudinal
business data allow to fix a firm’s identity once and for all at a common date and follow its

Recall that the denominator in the published BED job flow rates is the average Lit−1 in the notation
of Section 2, i.e. average employment in the size class between quarters t − 1 and t. This is slightly different
(0)
from initial employment in the size class, Lit−1 , which is used in BDS.

growth over a long period of time including several business cycles, as a function of its initial
size. Since all firms in existence start from size 0, the initial date cannot be too far back in
28

time, but certainly more than the one year of BDS can be helpful.
The only fully longitudinal U.S. business dataset that we have been able to access is
Compustat (see below for other countries.) This comprises only public companies, so it
is not a representative sample, like BDS. Yet, it contains useful information. Figure 14 is
reported from MPV08. We fix firm identities in 1975 and classify them once and for all in
size bins (by employment), large above 5,000 employees, and small otherwise. The reason
for the large size cutoff is that public companies are very large. Then, for each year from
1976 to 2005 (these are starting years, so the same 1977-2006 period covered by the BDS
where these are ending years), we calculate the growth rate of employment over the past year
at (initially, in 1975) large firms and subtract the growth rate of the other, initially small
firms in the sample. We plot this difference in growth rates, in a way that mimics Figure
3. Consistent with the patterns uncovered in BDS and BED, over four consecutive business
cycles this difference in growth rates is procyclical, and crosses zero when the labor market
turns tight, except for an outlier in 1987.
This analysis highlights one difficult issue that unavoidably arises with fully longitudinal
datasets. As explained above, the advantage is that we can fix the identities of a given
group of firms and then track them over a long time period. This allows us to prevent
reclassification and that new entrants change the composition of the sample. But the effect
of exit cannot be eliminated. Figure 14 only includes public companies that survived through
1976-2005, so there is a strong survivorship bias. If we tracked all companies that were listed
in 1976, we would then be losing some of them along the way to delisting and bankruptcy,
so we would allow only for job destruction from exit and not for job creation from entry.
This fact works in favor of using short longitudinal links as in BDS.11

4

The Distribution of Employment by Employer Size
over the Business Cycle

We continue our data analysis with the cyclical behavior of the distribution of employment
across size classes of their employers, firms or establishments. As discussed in Subsection 2.3,
the growth rate of the employment share of a given size class only approximates the growth
rate of employment in the set of firms initially in that size class, which is our main object
of interest, up to the Reclassification Bias. We find it useful, however, to report evidence
11
In the NBER Manufacturing Panel from Compustat, fixing firm sizes in 1975, the difference in growth
rates of employment between firms in the top quartile and firms below the median has the now familiar
pattern throughout 1975-1995: falling in recessions and gradually climbing in expansions. This is true
whether we define size in terms of initial employment, sales, capital or assets. We thank David Berger for
these calculations. Results are available upon request.

30

magnitude of the Reclassification Bias and because the data required to construct employment shares are much more widely available across countries than longitudinal data such
as BDS that make it possible to correct for reclassification. We provide some international
evidence towards the end of the paper.

4.1

Using BDS Data to Quantitatively Assess the Reclassification
Bias

The BDS dataset reports job flows and employment growth in each year t by initial (yeart − 1) size. It is therefore immune to the Reclassification Bias as it conveys longitudinal
information over two year-periods [t − 1, t] about size classes, the composition of which is
fixed over the entire period. However the same BDS dataset also allows construction of
employment shares of size classes each year. We can thus repeat the exercise of subsection
3.1.2 only using differences in the growth rates of employment shares across size classes.
Although this methodology is incorrect (because subject to the Reclassification Bias — see
Subsection 2.3), a comparison with the correct one illustrated in Subsection 3.1.2 can help
us gauge the quantitative relevance of the Reclassification Bias, as formally measured by the
third term in equation (1).
Figure 15 parallels the aggregate picture of the cyclical behavior of differential firm growth
across size classes drawn earlier in Figure 3, and shows that the message is essentially unchanged when one neglects the reclassification issue. Although the correlation is slightly
more negative in Figure 15 than in Figure 3, as we would expect because of reclassification
which pushes more firms in, hence imputes more growth to, the large firm size categories
when the economy grows and unemployment is low in booms, and vice versa in recessions,
the bias appears to be quantitatively very modest.
Fact 4. Reclassification plays a quantitatively negligible part in explaining the
higher cyclical sensitivity of large employers.

4.2

BED

While the BED data contains only job flows, in levels and rate (as a fraction of average size
(1/2)
over the quarter, Lit−1 ), also by firm size, we have obtained from the BLS an unpublished
tabulation of the time series of employment, establishment and firm counts by initial size of
the firm, for the whole U.S. economy (no breakdown by location or industry), in 1992:III2008:I. As for BDS we detrend employment share growth rates and correlate the deviations
from trend with those of the unemployment rate, at the same quarterly frequency. The
results, depicted on Figure 16, corroborate our previous findings from BDS: the negative
31

correlation is again very strong, at −0.77. Although that correlation is likely to overstate the
true difference in cyclical sensitivity of large and small employers, due to the Reclassification

Worker Flows by Employer Size over the Business
Cycle

In order to shed more light on the underlying sources of the cyclical movement in employment
shares and growth rates by firm size, we now turn to worker flows. A group of firms of similar
initial size can add employment by either adding more jobs (higher JC) or shedding fewer
(lower JD). Both are changes on the extensive margin in the number of firms in the group
that gain and lose employment. In turn, the intensity of each individual firm JC or JD can
vary. Furthermore, the status of a firm as a net creator or destroyer of jobs can change in
different ways. In particular, the firm can hire more or fewer workers, for given attrition,
or separations might increase, for given inflow. Finally, among separations, some originate
from outside opportunities that the firm cannot counter, such as outside offers to its workers
and voluntary quits to non-employment. Other separations such as layoffs, are originated
by the firm due to poor business conditions. In this section, we aim to shed some light
on which of these mechanisms are at play behind the cyclical behavior of the growth/size
32

relationship that we uncovered. The need for information on worker flows by employer size
at high frequency restricts the available time span in existing datasets. However we find
that, in the tight labor market of the late 1990s, large employers grew faster in part because
they poached more employees than their smaller competitors, hence had an additional source
of hires (beyond unemployment) they could draw from. Conversely, in the 2001 recession
layoffs at large employers, as measured by mass layoffs, spiked much more than layoffs at
large in the economy.

5.1

Sources of New Hires over the Business Cycle

We report from MPV08 evidence on where do new workers join employers of different sizes
at different stages of a business cycles. In that paper, we argue that the reason for the faster
growth of small firms in loose labor market and of large firms in a tight one is related to
the ease with which new hires can be found among the unemployed. When these abound,
all employers hire and grow at a rate that depends on their sampling weight in job search.
When unemployment grows scarce, large employers, which are typically more productive (in
revenue terms) and higher paying, can more easily poach employees from smaller competitors.
So they can keep growing their employment through that channel, and smaller employers
are out of luck and their growth is curbed, in relative terms.
We corroborate this hypothesis with evidence from publicly available data from the Census’ Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).12 SIPP contains information about
the workforce size of an individual’s current employer (employing establishment), as well as
individual job histories, with 4-year long worker longitudinal links and weekly information on
employment status. This allows a crude analysis of the poaching activity of establishments
as a function of their size. Figure 17 plots a measure of the fraction of new hires coming from
another employer (i.e. following an employer-to-employer transition) for three categories of
hiring establishment size.13 In other words, it plots a measure of the importance of poaching
in the recruitment activity of establishments, by size of the hiring establishment. Changes
in the design of the SIPP and other data limitations restrict the period over which that
indicator can be constructed to the years shown on Figure 17. While this admittedly constitutes very limited evidence, we still notice the following two points. First, poaching was
more intense in the latter half of the 1990s expansion than in the immediate aftermath of
the 2001 recession. This is true for all three categories of establishment size. Second, larger
establishments almost always poach more than smaller ones. This difference in “poaching
12

Information about the SIPP, as well as data files are available at www.bls.census.gov/sipp/.
Specifically, it is constructed as the fraction of workers who have changed employers in the previous year
and are now employed at an establishment in size category X without work interruption among all workers
having changed employers in the previous year and now employed at an establishment in size category X.

intensity”, however, is more pronounced in 1997-1999, when the labor market turns tight,
than in 2002-2004, when it is slack.

5.2

Layoffs

We do not have access to micro business data on gross separations by size of the employer.
One important component of separations is layoffs. The BLS provides two sources of information that we can use to assess whether large employers lay off (proportionally) more
workers in recessions.
The Mass Layoff Statistics (MLS) available starting in 1995, record the number of
episodes and the total number of workers involved each month in layoffs involving more
than 50 workers simultaneously. This is broken down by state and 3-digit industry.14
The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), starting in December 2000,
records (among others) layoffs for a sample of firms, also broken down by region and broad
industry groups.
14

“A mass layoff occurs when at least 50 initial UI claims are filed against an establishment during a
consecutive 5-week period. An extended mass layoff occurs when at least 50 initial claims are filed against
an establishment during a consecutive 5-week period and at least 50 workers have been separated from jobs
for more than 30 days.”

Fig. 18: Mass layoffs vs. all layoffs
By comparing layoffs at large establishments (MLS), which can only belong to mediumto-large firms, with layoffs at all employers (JOLTS), we can check whether in the 2001
recession and again in 2008 MLS layoffs rise faster than layoffs in general. Figure 18 leaves
no doubt that mass layoffs are wildly more volatile and concentrated in recessions than layoffs
at large.15 Large employers shrink more in recessions in part because they lay off a larger
proportion of their payroll, not (only) because they hire fewer or lose more workers to quits.

6

International Evidence

Business micro or semi-aggregated data (by employer size) on employment are available in
many countries. We now present evidence of the following, final stylized fact:
Fact 5. The higher cyclical sensitivity of large employers is a phenomenon that
is not unique to the U.S.. It is common to various countries, of different sizes
and stages of development.
15

JOLTS has been shown to have problems in that it severely undersamples small and young establishments, thus generating too small turnover rates (Davis et al., 2008). This makes the JOLTS sample biased
towards large employers. For us it is not a problem, because if JOLTS and MLS show a difference than a
fortiori the real universe of layoffs must be even more different than MLS. At any rate, Figure 18 plots both
the original JOLTS data and the amended data from Davis et al. (2008b).

35

A large empirical literature has tested in several countries the well-known hypothesis that
the distribution of firm size can be well approximated by a Pareto distribution, that is, the
log rank of an employer in the overall size distribution is linearly related to the log of its size.
The employment size distribution counts the shares of employers (firms or establishments)
in each size class, rather than the shares of employment. But there is a strict relationship
between the two, as employment in a size class is the average size in that class times the
share of employers. While most of this literature focuses on cross-sectional patterns, either
at one point in time or on average over some time period, a few articles do present and
comment on time series of the cross-sectional evidence. In particular, a power law is fitted
to cross-sectional data year by year, which allows to study the cyclical behavior of the
intercept and slope of the power law. We found that the growth rate of the employment
shares of large size classes is procyclical relative to small classes, so we should expect the
size distribution of employers to be more heavily weighted on large ones, hence to be more
unequal, when unemployment is low, and vice versa. This implies that the Pareto slope
should be countercyclical, yielding a flatter power law and a more unequal size distribution
in booms, and a steeper law in recessions. This is exactly what the literature has found (e.g.,
Marsili (2006) in the Dutch manufacturing sector, Delli Gatti et al. (2006) in a large sample
of Italian firms), although it has failed to draw its further implications, that is, to make the
connection and take the further step to the cyclicality of the size/growth relationship.

6.1

Employer Growth by Initial Size over the Business Cycle

For two countries (viz. Denmark and Brazil), we have been able to access full longitudinal
business microdata on employment from censuses for an extended period of time allowing
us to replicate the exercises that we performed for the U.S. with BDS and Compustat. In
both cases we compute the differential growth rate between initially large and small firms,
where “initially” refers either to the year before or to a given year, fixed once and for all at
the beginning of the sample. In both cases, the business micro data that we exploit have
been matched to information on the employees, an important dimension that we will exploit
in future research.

the entire Danish population aged 16 to 69.16 As a part of the IDA programme, Statistics
Denmark maintains an employer-level panel which contains all the basic information on
37

employers (essentially defined by a tax identifier), including workforce size in the last week
of November. The current panel length is 22 years, from 1980 to 2002, and the sample that
we use excludes public-sector and not-for-profit employers.
Being a panel of employers, the IDA firm file enables us to assign any particular employer
to a fixed size class for as many years as we like. It is possible, in particular, to replicate the
structure of the U.S. BDS data, where firms are assigned to a fixed size class over rolling twoyear windows. This is what we do in Figure 19, which plots for 1981-2003 the (detrended)
OECD unemployment rate and growth rate of large minus small firms, where size is fixed
a year in advance, as in the BDS. The familiar pattern emerges: initially large employers
grow faster when unemployment is unusually low, and vice versa. The correlation between
the two series is −.46.
As an alternative, the Danish employer panel also enables us to fix the composition of size
classes once and for all, as we did for the U.S. with the Compustat sample (see Subsection
3.3). In Figure 20 we allocate firms to the two size classes in 1983 and track the relative
growth rate of these two groups over the following 20 years, without ever reclassifying them.
While the two series are overall negatively correlated again (−0.5), the pattern is clearest
in 1983-1993, and then appears more blurred in the second half, 1993-2003. This is not too
surprising, and we do not take it as contradictory evidence, as firm sizes are not perennial
and significant reshuffling occurs over decades.
Our underlying theoretical framework considers size mostly as an indirect measure of
productivity, based on the amply documented positive relationship between employment
size and revenue-based measures of productivity. Another robust relationship is between
average wages paid by a firm and size. For this Danish dataset, both relationships have
been confirmed by Lentz and Mortensen (2008). Since IDA contains wage information, we
also consider initial wage, rather than initial size, as a measure of undelying productivity.
It is plausible that wages reflect productivity better than size, especially for young firms
that are still in their initial growth phase. In Figure 21 we allocate firms once and for all to
low- and high-paying bins according to mean wage earned by their employees in 1981. We
then compute, detrend and plot with the detrended unemployment rate the growth rate of
employment at initially high- and low-paying firms, where the former are on average larger.
Now the pattern holds strikingly well through the 1980s and 1990s, until 2003. Indeed, except
for the very first two years, the two series mirror each other almost perfectly (correlation
−0.76).

Brazil

We exploit longitudinal information on Brazilian employers in the formal sector from the
labor market census RAIS (Relação Annual de Informações Sociais). This is an administrative dataset collected annually by the Brazilian labor ministry, which includes all firms
in the Brazilian formal sector and provides information for all their workers. The ministry
collects demographic information for workers, such as age, education and sex, some information about establishments, such as sector and location, and provides information about the
job, such as the average wage earned during that year, the wage in December, the average
number of hours worked, occupation, dates of admission and separation, type of contract,
causes for separation.17
17

Access to RAIS is restricted to authorized researchers. Carlos Corseuil of IPEA performed the data
analysis for us. We take the occasion to thank him for his time and expertise.

We allocate firms to the familiar size bins in 1995 and track the growth rate of employment
in the two groups over the subsequent 10 years. As done before for the U.S. and Denmark, in
Figure 22 we plot the detrended differential growth rate of employment at initially (in 1995)
large minus small firms and the detrended unemployment rate. The correlation is clearly
negative after 1997. Most vividly, the harsh blow suffered by the Brazilian economy in 1998
as a consequence of the Asian crisis hits the larger firms hardest: it generates a sharp rise in
the unemployment rate and a corresponding drop in the relative employment growth of firms
that started out larger. As the shock is re-absorbed and the unemployment rate declines to
more normal levels, the differential growth of employment in large firms nicely recovers. The
initial 1995-1996 increase in the unemployment rate, which works against Fact 5, reflects
in part structural, rather than cyclical, factors. Estimates of the proportion of Brazilian
workers in the informal sector are declining before the Asian crisis, while unemployment
rises. After the crisis, this decline in the informal sector grinds to a halt.

The Distribution of Employment by Employer Size over the
Business Cycle

The type of data of easiest access is the distribution of employment among employers of
different sizes. Although this is only indirect evidence, as shown in previous sections the
cyclical behavior of employment shares by size classes in the U.S. is informative of the

United Kingdom

The UK Small Business Administration publishes a table of employment shares by classes
of firm size at annual frequency. We found on the web data for 1994-2006. The size cutoffs
are <20 and >249 employees. We compute and detrend employment share growth rates
and plot the cross-size-class difference thereof against the detrended UK unemployment rate
(from the UK Office of National Statistics). The correlation between those two series over
the 1994-2006 observation period is −0.24, smaller in absolute value than what we found for
other countries but still clearly negative, as visually clear on Figure 23.
6.2.2

Canada

As a part of its report on “Business Dynamics in Canada” (see Kanagarajah, 2003), Statistics
Canada has compiled annual employment shares by firm size categories over the two decades
1983-2003.18 The largest size category available is 500. From these data, we can compute
employment growth rates, with reclassification and including entrants. In Figure 24 we
plot the differential growth rate (>500 employees minus <20 employees) against detrended
unemployment (from the OECD), and we find the usual negative correlation, in this case
equal to −0.43.

A Firm-Ladder Model of Employer Size Dynamics

We now sketch a simple model of firm employment dynamics that can help to shed some
light on the empirical patterns that we have documented. Intentionally very stylized, this
model is meant to illustrate what we have argued in other work is an important mechanism
in labor markets. We refer to our theoretical work (MPV08, MPV09) for more details.
Let ut denote the unemployment rate at (continuous) time t. Let δt denote the separation rate and λ0t the job-finding rate from unemployment. Assume constant labor force
participation. The equation
u̇t = δt (1 − ut ) − λ0t ut
is called a “bathtub” model. As in a bathtub the inflow of water from the faucet and the
outflow from the drain determine the level of the water line, so the inflow into unemployment,
equal to the separation rate δt times the employment rate 1−ut , and the outflow, equal to the
18

42

job-finding rate λ0t times the unemployment rate, determine the change in the unemployment
rate.
We propose a “firm ladder” model. Workers can search randomly on and off the job and
receive offers at rates λ1t and λ0t respectively. When unemployed, a worker accepts any offers.
When employed and confronted with an outside offer, a worker always chooses one of the
two firms, according to a ranking that all workers agree upon. That is, if any worker prefers
working for any firm A over any firm B, so do all other workers, and thus any A employee
will reject offers from B and any B employee will accept offers from A. Additionally, some
worker lose jobs from all rungs of the firm ladder and become unemployed, as in the bathtub
model, so this is a slippery ladder, while the unemployed find firms randomly.
Let θ ∈ [0, 1] denote a firm’s rank in the unanimous worker ordering, and Lt (θ) its
employment size, that we treat as a continuous variable. Normalize the measure of active
firms to 1. Assume that, conditional on making a contact with another firm, the probability
of sampling a firm with rank below θ, either from employment or unemployment, is Q (θ), a
proper cdf with density q. Applying a law of large number at the individual firm level, the
size of firm Lt (θ) evolves according to


Z θ
L̇t (θ) = − {δ + λ1t [1 − Q (θ)]} Lt (θ) + q (θ) λ0t ut + λ1t
Lt (x) dx.
0

The outflow from the firm occurs at rate δ to unemployment and at rate λ1t , the contact
rate on the job, times 1 − Q (θ), the probability of sampling a higher-ranked firm. The inflow
occurs at rate λ0t from unemployment and at rate λ1t from other firms, and a measure
Rθ
Lt (x) dx are employed by lower-ranked firms and move to θ. In either type of inflow,
0
workers contact a firm of rank θ, conditional on making a contact, with “chance” q (θ).
This is a Partial Differential Equation in time and rank, with a given initial condition
L0 (θ) which describes the initial distribution of firm size by preference ranking. Notice that
R
this pins down also initial unemployment u0 = 1 − L0 (θ) dθ. If the arrival rates λit are
constant over time, as shown in MPV08, this PDE has the solution

which converges to a steady state distribution

Now suppose that L0 (θ) < L∞ (θ) for all θ. That is, the economy starts “depressed” and
all firms grow in size, while unemployment falls. At what relative pace do firms of different
43

ranks grow? In other words, is the growth rate of employment by given rank L̇t (θ) /Lt (θ)
increasing or decreasing in rank?
The natural application to our setting is as follows. Let θ denote a firm-specific productivity parameter, fixed over time, and assume that L0 (θ) is increasing in θ. That is, more
productive firms start out bigger. Then, given the assumed worker preference ordering over
employers, this initial ranking is never reversed. In MPV08 we calibrate the parameters
of this PDE (λ0 , λ1 , δ, L0 and Q) to match stylized facts about worker turnover (to/from
unemployment and job-to-job) and the distribution of employment by size coming out of a
recession (L0 ), but not the evolution of firm sizes. When we compute the resulting path of
Lt (θ), we find that initially larger, preferred firms converge more slowly to their steady state
size. As we observe in the data, the relative growth rate of initially large minus small firms
increases from a minimum after a trough to the following peak.
The intuition is simple. All firms have access to an inflow from unemployment that is
independent of firm size. This inflow declines over time with unemployment. As the size of
small firms grows, the pool of workers that can be poached also rises. While initially small,
lower ranked firms cannot poach much and soon lose their hiring pool of unemployed, larger,
higher ranked firms compensate this shortfall with an increasing inflow of job-to-job quits
from lower firms. See MPV08 for quantitative results.
In MPV08, MPV09 we rationalize these dynamics in the equilibrium of a dynamic large
game where firms differ by productivity θ and post employment contracts, which can be
summarized by a time-varying continuation utility promised and delivered to the worker. If
more productive firms start out larger, they have two incentives to make better offers: they
have more to lose from not producing, and they have more workers to lose to competitors.
Therefore, more productive firms always offer more and attract workers from less productive ones, which rationalizes our preference ordering over employers. This Rank-Preserving
Equilibrium is generic under weak assumptions, and generates the dynamic described above.
In our quantitative exercise, wages are also increasing in productivity, thus in size. Hence,
ranking firms by initial productivity or size makes little difference to predict the timing of
growth, as we indeed find in the Danish data. In MPV09, simulations from a stochastic
model with aggregate productivity shocks generate patterns that are qualitatively consistent
with our empirical findings both in booms and slumps. More productive, larger firms are
more cyclically sensitive.

Concluding Remarks

In this paper, we show evidence that large employers are more cyclically sensitive. This
pattern is robust to a variety of measures of relative employment growth, employer size and
classification by size, treatments of entry and exit of firms and establishments, industry,
geographical and firm age breakdowns. Evidence on gross job flows and on worker flows by
employer size depicts a coherent picture of labor market dynamics. Very similar patterns
are observed in other, quite diverse countries.
We conclude by illustrating our research agenda. Although the datasets that we have
explored are of high quality in terms of contents, coverage, accuracy, and duration, there
is always scope for improvement. First, there is an issue of time span. The main datasets,
BDS and BED, cannot be extended back in time given the availability of underlying micro
data. Repeated cross-sections like CBP are available in archival form for the post-war period,
but not every year. Alternative sources that extend over longer periods cover only specific
sectors. Second, finer industry-level analysis appears infeasible because of the 1997 transition
from SIC to NAICS. Third, micro business data underlying BDS (the Longitudinal Business
Database at the Census Bureau) and BED (at the Bureau of Labor Statistics) would let
us replicate our analysis of Compustat, Denmark, and Brazil, allocate firms to size classes
once and for all and track their growth over decades. We discussed the pros and cons of this
approach. Additionally, information at the establishment level on firm wages, assets, sales,
intermediate inputs would allow us to verify whether employer size is really capturing some
measure of productivity. Finally, matched employer-employee longitudinal datasets like IDA
from Denmark can help us better gauge the firm-specific component of wages that attracts
workers to specific employers, as well as connect directly worker and job flows.
From a conceptual viewpoint, the data require a theoretical framework to make sense
of the patterns that we uncover. Indeed, even our measurement is strongly influenced by
our theoretical work in MPV08 and MPV09. There, we identify a ‘firm’ with a wage policy,
and we base our explanation of the facts on competition for workers among heterogeneous
firms in frictional labor markets. Alternative definitions of a firm, based on technology (scale
of operation, capital adjustment costs), span of control, borrowing constraints, and others,
can be similarly embedded in an equilibrium framework to produce predictions that can be
confronted with our facts.
