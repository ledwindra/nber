ABSTRACT
Using the internal March CPS, we create and in this paper distribute to the larger research community
a cell mean series that provides the mean of all income values above the topcode for any income source
of any individual in the public use March CPS that has been topcoded since 1976. We also describe
our construction of this series. When we use this series together with the public use March CPS, we
closely match the yearly mean income levels and income inequalities of the U.S. population found
using the internal March CPS data.

1. Introduction
The public use version of the March Current Population Survey (CPS) is the primary data
source used by public policy researchers and administrators to investigate yearly trends in
average income and its distribution in the United States. The public use March CPS is a large
nationally representative sample of households collected each March, since 1942, by the U.S.
Census Bureau.1 Its detailed questions on the employment and income sources of household
members make it an extremely valuable resource for tracking long term trends in the economic
well-being of Americans. However, to protect the confidentiality of its respondents, the U.S.
Census Bureau censors the income of individuals above specified topcoded levels in the public
use March CPS data that it makes available to the outside research community. The impact of
U.S. Census Bureau topcoding procedures on measured wage earnings and income inequality for
the population as a whole have been explored by Feng, Burkhauser, and Butler [4] and
Burkhauser, Feng, and Jenkins [2].
In 2006 we were granted permission by the U.S. Census Bureau to use the internal March
CPS to test the sensitivity of measured income and income inequality in the public use CPS to
alternative methods of providing information on topcoded values. And to then provide
researchers without access to the internal March CPS data with our best method of capturing
information on these topcoded values from the internal data, without unduly risking the
confidentially of CPS respondents. Using the internal March CPS data we create and in this
paper distribute to the larger research community a cell mean series extending back to 1976 that
provides the mean of all income values above the topcode for any income source of any
individual in the public use March CPS that has been topcoded.2 Our cell mean series, which

2

includes years from 1976-2002, can then be used in conjunction with cell means provided by the
Census Bureau for later years to create a complete set of cell means from 1976-2007.
We show that when we use this extended cell mean series together with the public use
March CPS, we are able to closely match the yearly mean income of the U.S. population found
with the internal March CPS data over the period 1976-2002. We then show that this corrected
public use March CPS does a better job of matching income inequality trends found in the
internal March CPS than those previously available in the literature.
2. Topcoding in the public use March CPS
In the March CPS, a respondent in each household is asked a series of questions on the
sources of income of the household. Starting in 1976 they reported income from 11 sources and
since 1988 they have done so for income from 24 sources. These income sources are listed in
Appendix Table 1. While this is an effective way of capturing total household income, it
complicates efforts to protect the confidentiality of respondents and their households. Rather
than simply topcoding high total household income values in the public use March CPS, the U.S.
Census Bureau must topcode high values for each source of household income. Otherwise the
income of high-income individuals and their households could be reconstructed by summing
each individual source of income. The full list of topcode values over time in the public use CPS
are reported in Appendix Tables 2 and 3.
Prior to 1996, the U.S. Census Bureau assigned the topcode value from that source of
income to all topcoded income values, regardless of the total income of the individual or the
individuals’ household. For example, in 1990 the topcode for Social Security income was
$29,999. Individuals reporting Social Security income above that value were assigned that

3

value, even if that relatively low value in the distribution of total household income in the United
States was the only source of their household’s income.
In 1996, rather than simply assigning the topcode value of that income source to
individuals in the public use March CPS, the U.S. Census Bureau used values from the internal
March CPS to assign a cell mean value for each topcoded labor earnings value in the public use
March CPS. In 1999, the Census Bureau started to provide cell mean values to nongovernmental non-labor earnings income sources in a similar fashion. For income from nonlabor earnings sources, these cell means provide the mean income of all topcoded individuals
from that source. For income from labor earnings sources, the U.S. Census Bureau provides
more detailed information, providing cell means conditional on the topcoded individual’s race,
gender, and employment status.
Researchers using these cell means in conjunction with the public use March CPS will
obtain mean income values that more closely mirror those in the internal March CPS data.
Hence the U.S. Census Bureau’s cell means series has since 1996 added useful information to
the public use March CPS.
Obviously, cell means do not provide all the information on the income of the population
topcoded in the public use data available in the internal data, since cell means can’t be used to
capture the actual dispersion of income among those at the highest end of each source of income
in the March CPS data. But cell means not only allow researchers to better track mean income
with the public use data, but also show how much income is being topcoded from each source of
income.
Because the U.S. Census Bureau cell means series starts in 1996, using the public use
March CPS data without correcting for this major change in the reported income values of those

4

at the highest end of each of its sources of income results in a significant increase in measured
income in 1996 and beyond simply due to more accurate reporting of their income. Hence while
the use of cell means after 1996 makes the public use March CPS better conform to the internal
March CPS, not taking this improvement in measurement into account will grossly overestimate
how much actual income increased in 1996 among those at the highest income levels. And
because these topcodes occur throughout the income distribution, attempting to account for them
by simply using a 90/10 ratio will not fully control for their impact on measured income
inequality. (See Burkhauser, Feng, and Jenkins [2])
The major increase in the accuracy of the public use March CPS in 1996 is a specific
example of the more general problem that income topcoding presents researchers interested in
measuring levels and trends in the income and income distribution of the U.S. population—
inconsistent topcode levels lead to artificial increases or decreases in mean incomes as different
fractions of the population are subject to topcoding each year. (See: Levy and Murnane [8] for an
early review of the income distribution literature and a more formal statement of this problem.)
This is a legitimate concern since topcodes in the public use March CPS have, in general,
non-systematically increased over the past 30 years and some part of the measured increase in
income over this time in the uncorrected data is caused by topcoding capturing a larger portion of
the income distribution. Using cell means substantially alleviates this problem after 1996, since
cell means provide all the information available in the internal data on total income. As a result,
even if public topcodes are inconsistently adjusted in the public use March CPS, mean income
for the entire population in the internal March CPS can be matched with the public use data
using cell means.

5

Despite the U.S. Census Bureau’s attempt to alleviate the problem of topcoding, their cell
means have generally been ignored by researchers studying United States long-term income
trends, since to do otherwise exacerbates time-inconsistencies by using unadjusted data before
1996 and cell mean data thereafter. Instead, researchers analyzing data that includes years prior
to 1996 use other methods of controlling for inconsistent topcoding. These methods include
measuring inequality with 90/10 ratios to avoid complications from topcoding at the top of the
distribution, truncating the data by removing the top 2.5% of wage earners (Lerman [7]), or
artificially lowering the topcodes to create a series with a constant percentage of people topcoded
in every year (Burkhauser, Butler, Feng, and Houtenville [1]). While each of these methods is
preferable to using the unadjusted data, they also have drawbacks.
Burkhauser, Feng, and Jenkins [2] show that using 90/10 ratios may not alleviate the
problem, since individuals are topcoded by income source and not total income and therefore
topcoded individuals may fall below the 90th percentile and impact 90-10 ratios. Additionally,
any analysis of inequality based on just 2 points in the distribution will be less informative than
analyses using a Gini or Theil coefficient that incorporates more of the available data.
As can be seen by the growing number of people in Tables 1 and 2 who are topcoded in
the public use CPS data for each income source from 1976-2007, using a truncated dataset or
dropping the topcodes to provide a consistent income series is becoming increasingly
problematic. Part of this increase in topcode counts was by design as the U.S. Census Bureau
attempted to ensure that enough people were topcoded in the public data to provide meaningful
cell means, while still protecting respondent confidentiality. The number of individuals
topcoded for secondary wages, farm, and self-employment earnings increased significantly in
1996, the year the U.S. Census Bureau lowered the topcodes for all secondary labor income

6

sources and began providing cell means. Similarly, in 1999 when cell means were first provided
for non-labor income and the topcode values for those income sources dropped, the number of
individuals topcoded from these sources spiked. However, since 1999 topcode levels have
remained unchanged but increases in income over time have led to further increases in the
number of individuals topcoded. As illustrated in Figure 1, in 2007, almost 6% of individuals in
the public use CPS had at least one income source that was topcoded, the highest rate of
topcoding since 1976. Unless public use CPS topcodes are systematically increased as income
increases, these topcodes will cut deeper into the income distribution. In that case consistent
topcoding methods will do an increasingly poorer job of capturing trends at the top of the income
distribution as they remove larger fractions of the population to maintain their consistency.
While each of these previously employed methods improve the unadjusted public use
March CPS data, the lack of publicly available data on individuals above the topcode thresholds
prior to 1996 makes it impossible to obtain an accurate picture of long-term income trends across
the population captured in the internal March CPS. Recognizing the benefit of cell means for
replicating internal March CPS, we obtained access to the internal March CPS data and received
permission to extend the cell mean series back to 1976.
3. Procedures for Obtaining and using the Internal March CPS
To gain access to restricted access U.S. Census Bureau data like the internal March CPS,
a researcher must submit a proposal to one of the nine U.S. Census Bureau Research Data
Centers (RDCs) describing the nature of the proposed research, the required data set and the
expected results. The research must be beneficial to the U.S. Census Bureau by, for example,
improving data quality or methods of collecting, measuring, or tabulating a survey, census, or
estimate. If the proposal is accepted, the researcher and any associates working at the RDC must

7

obtain Special Sworn Status to do so. All are bound by law to maintain confidentiality, like any
other U.S. Census Bureau employee.
In 2006, we were granted permission through this process to use the internal March CPS
to test the sensitivity of measured income inequality in the public use CPS to alternative methods
of providing information on topcoded persons and to provide researchers without access to the
internal March CPS data with our best method of capturing information on these topcoded values
from the internal data, without unduly risking the confidentially of CPS respondents.
We were given access to internal March CPS records from 1976-2005. These data
records include information on income above the public use topcode thresholds for respondents
in the March CPS survey. However, since our research project was limited to how topcoding
impacts measures of inequality in the United States, the files do not contain the responses to all
of the non-income related questions in the March CPS dataset. These omissions occur because
the U.S. Census Bureau limits internal data availability to data within the scope of the project.
Additionally, even the internal March CPS data, which are not subject to top coding, have been
censored to various degrees over time.
This censoring was initially implemented in the internal March CPS due to data-storage
limitations in the computing systems of the 1970s which necessitated truncating written records
to 5 digits. While these data storage limitations are no longer a concern, the internal censoring of
income values has continued, partially due to concerns about data reliability of individuals who
report an extremely high income value and partially due to continuing concerns over
confidentially. Thus, the U.S. Census Bureau does not maintain any versions of the internal
March CPS data that are not subject to this form of censoring.3 The internal March CPS data we
were provided is identical in this respect to the internal March CPS data the U.S Census Bureau

8

uses to produce all official United States income statistics. The extent to which censoring exists
in this internal data can be seen in Appendix Tables 4 and 5, which provide the censoring levels
in the internal data for each income source over time. (See Feng, Burkhauser, and Butler [4] for
a discussion of the problem of censorship in the internal March CPS labor earnings series and
Welniak [11] and Burkhauser, Feng, and Jenkins [2] for a similar discussion for all sources of
income.)
While our data agreement allows us to freely explore the internal March CPS data in our
file within the purview of our project, U.S. Census Bureau data confidentiality requirements limit
the level of detail of our findings that we can release to the broader research community. Our
results, like almost all publicly released data products were reviewed by the U.S. Census Bureau
Disclosure Review Board (DRB) to ensure that they were consistent with its disclosure policies.
Six members of the DRB represent the U.S. Census Bureau’s demographic, decennial, and
economic directorates, and its RDCs. An additional three members represent the research and
policy areas. Although our data went through the standard review procedure and had to be
approved by this board before its release, occasionally exceptions are made to this review policy,
which are outlined in Zayatz [12].
In order to release data, we were required to send a memo to the chair of the DRB
accompanied by the DRB checklist, the questionnaire from the survey or census, a list of
variables of interest, a record layout (if microdata), table outlines (if tabular data), and on
occasion some cross tabulations of the variables of interest. The DRB checklist asks basic
questions about the content of the data file to be released and also has sections for microdata,
frequency count data, and magnitude data. This procedure helps to ensure consistency in the
DRB’s decision making process.

9

Topcoding of the public use March CPS is one of the DRB’s main tools for protecting the
confidentiality of respondents. While the DRB is not responsible for setting the actual topcode
levels in the public use March CPS, they do provide the guidelines that dictate what fraction of
individuals must be topcoded from each income source before confidentiality becomes
compromised. These guidelines state that either 3% of individuals with positive income from an
income source must be topcoded or 0.5% of all individuals including those without income from
the source must be topcoded – whichever results in fewer individuals topcoded. In practice, for
all income sources other than primary labor earnings, topcoding 3% of individuals with positive
income from an income source will result in fewer individuals topcoded – so this is the rule that
is used most often. However for some income sources these guidelines have been waived thus
permitting a smaller fraction of the population to be topcoded.
Since topcoding is an important element of the U.S. Census Bureau’s confidentiality
policies, in our requests to release cell mean information about topcoded individuals, it was
always necessary to ensure that no personal income information could be identified from the data
we released. The general guideline for releasing information on topcoded individuals is that any
means must be based on at least 3 topcoded responses, and in many cases a minimum threshold
of 5 is used. These means can be released at the national level, state level, or even for a
subgroup of the population with a given geographic level as long as the threshold is met. The
DRB has stated that the mean, median, and standard deviation of the topcoded values may be
released if there are at least 5 topcoded values and in doing so, the mean and median should be
rounded to 2 significant digits. In addition, quantiles of the topcoded values may be released if
there are at least 10 topcoded values in each quantile and if the quantile bounds are rounded to 2
significant digits.

10

These guidelines prohibited us from releasing cell means for income sources with less
than 5 individuals. However, in this case, we were permitted to combine such an income source
with another one in order to create a cell mean based on 5 or more individuals.
Even when our cell means were based on 5 or more observations, the DBR further
limited their release if they could be combined with other previously released cell means to
induce the actual income of a specific person. For example, this could occur if we had
previously released a file including the mean of 6 topcoded values and requested the release of
the mean of 5 of these values. Given those two means, the exact value of the remaining
respondent could be deduced and hence release of the mean of 5 would be prohibited based on
the DRB guidelines.
Since 1996, the U.S. Census Bureau started to provide cell means for earnings sources in
the public use March CPS. To mitigate potential disclosure concerns associated with our cell
mean series, for these years we use their identical cell definitions, taking particular note of which
cells are combined to achieve groups of 5 or more individuals when less than 5 people are
topcoded from an income source. Prior to 1996, such issues were of less concern since no
comprehensive cell mean information had been released.
4. The Extended Public Use March CPS Cell Mean Series
Since the U.S. Census Bureau topcodes individuals in the public use March CPS on each
separate income source, we calculated cell means for each source of income separately—11 prior
to 1988 and 24 since then. In addition, mirroring U.S. Census Bureau practices in their cell
means releases since 1996, our cell means are weighted mean incomes of all individuals above
the topcode value for the source for all non-labor earnings income sources. And for all labor
earnings sources, the cell means are the weighted mean incomes of individuals with income

11

above the topcoded, conditional on the individual’s race, gender, and employment status. The
cell mean values for 1976-1987 are provided in Tables 3 through 6 and for 1988-2002 in Tables
7 through 11. Although we only provide cell means through 2002, a comparison of our cell
means since the U.S. Census Bureau began releasing them in 1996 illustrate that our cell means
series is virtually identical to those they release. Thus, the cell means we provide can be used in
conjunction with cell means produced by the U. S. Census Bureau in years since 2002 to provide
a full set of cell means dating back to 1976.
While our cell mean creation methods described above closely follow those of the U.S.
Census Bureau there are small differences. In contrast to the U.S. Census Bureau, we adjusted
the treatment of individuals who have income exactly at the topcode level in order to better
conform to the public use March CPS data. In the U.S. Census Bureau cell mean series,
individuals who have income exactly at the topcode level are not considered to have been
topcoded because the topcode is not binding. However, prior to 1996, individuals whose income
is exactly at the topcode level are listed in the public use March CPS data as having the same
level of income as those whose income is above the topcode and hence are bound by it.
As a result, when using just the public use March CPS income records, it can’t be
determined who among those with income listed at the topcode threshold had income that was
bound by it and whose actual income was exactly at the topcode value. If we had used the
current U.S. Census Bureau method of only including individuals who have income above the
topcode value in their cell means, this would have limited the ability of researchers to use our
extended cell mean series with the public use March CPS data.
Therefore, for years prior to 1996 we instead treat individuals who have income exactly
at the topcode as topcoded and include their income in the cell means. For many years there is

12

no difference between these two approaches as no individuals have reported incomes exactly at
the topcode value. Hence this distinction is relevant only in years where topcodes are round
numbers so clustering in reported values occurs at the topcode level. The actual number of
individuals whose reported income is the same as the topcode is provided in Appendix Table 6.
Starting in 1996, when the U.S. Census Bureau introduced cell means, income for
individuals who face a binding topcode constraint are listed with their cell mean income in the
public use data, so they can be distinguished from individuals for whom the topcode does not
bind by users of the public use data. Thus, starting in 1996 we follow the census technique and
only include individuals with income greater than the topcode level in our cell means.
The second deviation from the method described above occurs when less than 5
individuals are topcoded from a non-labor income source or from a demographic group within
that income source for a labor earnings source. For confidentiality reasons, the U.S. Census
Bureau would not allow us to release cell means for these groups. Instead, we combined 2 or
more cells to achieve a group of at least 5 individuals. We then provide the mean of topcoded
incomes from this combined cell. This is the same procedure for handling small cells used by
the U.S. Census Bureau in the cell means they have released in recent years (2007 CPS Annual
Social and Economic Supplement Technical Documentation).
For labor earnings sources we used the current U.S. Census Bureau convention of
combining demographic groups with less than 5 topcoded individuals into a single cell for that
income source. If there were still less than 5 individuals, we combined it with the next smallest
cell from the same income source to achieve a cell with more then 5 people.
For non-labor income sources, it was necessary to combine observations across sources
of income. For these, we first attempted to combine similar sources of income, such as 1st and

13

2nd source disability income. If there was no clear matching income source, we combined the
small cells into a single group, as was done for the labor income sources. In all cases, when we
combine cells due to the small cell size, we note it in the relevant tables.
There are also several missing values (“N/A”) in the extended cell mean tables we
provide. Before the introduction of U.S. Census Bureau-provided cell means in 1996, missing
values indicate that no one has been topcoded from the specified source of income or fits that
demographic group. After 1996, it indicates either: (1) no one is topcoded from the income
source or (2) that the internal censoring point is equal to the public topcode so no one has income
in the internal dataset that is above the public topcode. In both cases, no new information can be
gained using internal data or the cell means series.4
5. Limitation of using the extended cell mean series
While the extended cell mean series is useful for studies using income data from the
public use March CPS, it also has limitations. As we will show it matches the mean values in the
internal March CPS quite closely but in doing so, it reflects the same problems with censorship
of those at the highest end of each source of income and their households in the internal March
CPS. However, since this is the same data used to produce official U.S. Census Bureau
statistics, these remaining censorship problems for users of the public use March CPS data are no
worse than those used by the U.S. Census Bureau to produce its official income statistics with
the internal March CPS.
Because our cell mean series, as well as the U.S. Census Bureau cell mean series, are
based on the internal March CPS data, these internal censoring issues limit the additional
information that the cell means provide. Specifically, one should pay careful attention to
changes in the internal censoring points which introduce trend-breaks in our cell mean series.

14

Since 1976, there were 3 years where internal censoring points were adjusted substantially and
thus trends at these years should be considered with caution.
The first is 1986, when the internal censoring points for labor income sources increased
from $99,999 to $250,000. The second is 1988 when the income sources were redefined and
expanded from 11 to 24, redefining censoring points in the process. The third is 1994 when the
internal censoring points were increased from $299,999 for primary labor earnings and $99,999
for secondary labor earnings to $999,999 for all labor earnings sources. A fourth increase
occurred in 1995, when internal censoring points for primary and secondary wage earnings were
increased to $1,099,999. However in terms of consistency, very few individuals fall into this
range, so this increase is much less troublesome than the other three adjustments. (See Appendix
Tables 2-5 for the topcoded value for all sources of income.)
In addition, because cell means are based on the internal March CPS, which is subject to
some censoring at the very top of the distribution, the cell means series do not reveal the full
scope of the U.S. income distribution. However, while the public use March CPS generally
provides complete information for only around 94-98% of the sample population, the internal
March CPS is able to provide income information for 99.0 to 99.8% of the sample distribution.
The percentages of the population that are topcoded in the public use March CPS and
censored in the internal March CPS are illustrated in Figure 1. Since the public use March CPS
with our extended cell means series incorporates information about the incomes for all
individuals below the internal March CPS censoring points, results using this series can provide
information to researchers on the 1 to 5% of the sample population that is unobserved in the
public use March CPS without cell means but are not impacted by the internal March CPS
censoring points. Additionally, for the small fraction of individuals who are censored in the

15

internal March CPS, their cell mean value will be significantly closer to their true income than
their public topcode value.
6. Impact of using the extended cell mean series
Below we show the added value of using our cell mean series with the public use March
CPS. We do so by first comparing mean income in the United States since 1976 using our cell
mean series with other available topcoding methods. We then do the same comparing Gini
coefficients for each year since 1976 using the other topcoding methods.
In Table 12 we calculate mean household income using our extended cell mean series
(Cell Mean) and compare it to the public use March CPS data including the U.S. Census Bureau
cell means since 1996 series (Unadjusted), the public use March CPS data removing the U.S.
Census Bureau provided cell means since 1996 series (Adjusted), and the internal March CPS
data series (Internal).
Thanks to cell means, the mean income of individuals in 2002 captured in the Unadjusted
data is very close to our Cell Mean data and both are very close to the values in the 2002 Internal
data. So for those only interested in evaluating the mean household income of individuals in the
United States in 2002, the current Unadjusted data or our Cell Mean data nicely capture the
means in the Internal data. And this is true for all years since 1996 when cell means were first
provided by the U.S. Census Bureau.
But for those interested in the trends in these series prior to 1996 the Unadjusted data is
flawed because it does not provide cell means for persons above the topcoded values. Hence its
mean values are significantly smaller than those produced using the Internal data. In 1995, for
example, using the Unadjusted data will understate mean household income in the United States

16

by 5.8% when compared to mean household income using Internal data. In contrast, our Cell
Mean data provide yearly means very close to those from the Internal data for all years.
Since topcoding may have drastically different impacts when looking at different income
sources and populations, in addition to examining the change in mean household income, we also
looked at mean labor earnings at the individual level for full-time/full-year workers. These
results are presented in Table 13. The patterns are similar to those discussed in Table 12. When
analyzing only the years after 1996, the Unadjusted and Cell Mean series both do a good job of
capturing the mean labor earnings found in the Internal data. However, prior to 1996 there is
again a significant difference between the results using the Unadjusted series and the Internal
series. In fact, the percentage difference between these series is larger than those for household
income since many of the individuals whose income is significantly over the public topcodes are
topcoded for labor earnings. In 1995, for example, using the Unadjusted data will understate
labor earnings by 7% compared to labor earnings using the Cell Mean or Internal data. In
contrast to these three series, the Adjusted series understates mean household income in every
year since it does not use cell means to adjust for top coding.
More interesting than looking at the impact of using cell means on mean income is how
the choice of topcoding procedure impacts various measures of inequality. In Burkhauser and
Larrimore [3], we examined the impact of topcoding on one type of cross-group inequality and
find that without correcting for topcoding through the use of cell means you will understate the
drop in the economic well being of individuals with disabilities over the past two decades.
Using cell means also impacts measures of population level inequality such as the Gini
Coefficient. In Figure 2 we report the levels and trends in size-adjusted household income for
1976-2007 based on Gini values estimated from our Cell Means, Unadjusted, Adjusted, and

17

Internal data series. As is standard when looking at household income inequality, we controlled
for household size by examining the size-adjusted household income of individuals instead of
simply their household’s total income.5 To adjust for the number of individuals in the
household, we divided the total income in the household by the square root of the number of
household members.
Because the public use March CPS is topcoded, unless cell means are used, mean
household income and its distribution across the population (Gini values) will be understated
relative to those estimated from the internal March CPS. Since cell means provide more
information about individuals at the top of the income distribution in this topcoded data set,
using the cell mean series with the public use March CPS data will increase measured inequality
and hence increase measured inequality in the public use March CPS data.
In all years the Adjusted series that reports only the topcode value for all those above the
topcode is below the Internal data. To correct for this difference between inequality measured
using the Adjusted and Internal Gini values, the U.S. Census Bureau introduced topcoding in
1996. The result is reflected in the difference between the Unadjusted and Adjusted values in
Figure 2. Prior to 1996 they are identical. After 1996 the Unadjusted values now equal the
Internal values and are dramatically greater than the Adjusted values. While they now better
represent the values found in the Internal data, anyone uncritically using this series to explain
changes in United States income inequality would greatly exaggerate its increase in 1996.
Our Cell Mean series corrects this problem by accurately matching the Internal series
Gini values in all years. Hence it provides a consistent way of capturing inequality as measured
using the Internal data. But anyone uncritically using this series to explain changes in United
States income inequality would also slightly exaggerate its increase in 1986 and in 1988 when

18

there were increases to the internal censoring points and would greatly exaggerate its increase in
1994 when major changes occurred in the way the March CPS was collected including
significant changes in the internal censoring points.. All these issues are discussed in more detail
in Burkhauser, Feng, and Jenkins [2]. Hence while our cell means series provides researchers
without access to the internal March CPS data with a useful way to approximate its means and
distribution, it does not solve the problems created by censoring of the internal March CPS data
itself.
7. Conclusions and Recommendations
The fraction of individuals who are topcoded is growing in the public use March CPS,
limiting the ability of researchers to examine trends at the top of the income distribution as well
as trends to the income distribution as a whole. While cell means can help alleviate this
problem, because the U.S. Census Bureau-provided cell mean series began in 1996, its
usefulness is restricted to income trend studies since then. Here we not only describe how we
created a cell means series beginning in1976 for the public use March CPS data using internal
March CPS data but provide that series to all researchers. We also demonstrate that this series
can be used in conjunction with the public use March CPS to provide results in a variety of
contexts that closely match those using the internal March CPS data and do so better than other
available methods in the income literature.
Prior to the introduction of cell means, because the U.S. Census Bureau did not
systematically adjust its topcodes in the public use March CPS to the same percentile in the
income distribution each year, measured mean income and its distribution in the public use
March CPS did not consistently match such measured values using the internal March CPS data
in level or trend. The introduction of cell means has dramatically reduced this problem. All

19

income that is reported below the internal censoring levels of the internal March CPS data can
now be captured in income statistics using the public use March CPS data, thus mitigating or
eliminating the inconsistencies caused by changing public topcodes, depending on the income
statistics observed.
However, the full implications of the introduction of cell means on U.S. Census Bureau
policies with respect to where to place topcodes each year, has not been fully considered. Prior to
the provision of cell means, it might have been reasonable to believe that researchers would
prefer that topcodes not be systematically changed each year. But that is no longer the case.
Because systematically updating topcodes each year will provide more accurate data to users of
the public use March CPS, the U.S. Census Bureau should annually update these values. In
doing so rather than maintaining consistency in the nominal value of topcodes from previous
years, new topcodes should be set at the highest possible level that both maintain confidentiality
requirements and keeps enough individuals above the topcode threshold to produce separate cell
means for each non-labor income source.
The U.S. Census Bureau’s effort to maintain consistency in the nominal values of its
topcodes has resulted in information being censored in the public use March CPS far in excess of
the DRB’s requirements for protecting the confidentiality of respondents. In recent years, over
5% of respondents with positive income in the public use March CPS have been topcoded for
secondary wage, labor, and farm earnings as well as from some non-labor income sources. This
is the case even though the DRB’s confidentiality requirements only require 3% of these
individuals to be topcoded. Given that there is no significant cost to providing full information
about individuals’ incomes up to the 3% threshold set by the DRB, the U.S. Census Bureau
should increase the topcodes for these income sources to this threshold.

20

A second factor the U.S. Census Bureau should consider in updating its topcodes is the
effect that these changes will have on its ability to provide cell means for each income source.
An increase in topcodes allows researchers to observe the true income of more individuals.
Additionally, as the remaining group who are topcoded shrinks, their cell mean better estimates
each of their reported incomes. However, this gain in information is offset to some degree if the
new topcode reduces the remaining group below 5, since this cell mean must be merged with the
cell mean from another income source to protect data confidentiality.
For non-labor earnings, adjusting the topcode for one source of income has no effect on
the topcode level for other income sources. Thus, it is relatively easy to lower the topcode for a
single source of income to ensure that at least 5 individuals are topcoded and a separate cell
mean can be produced. Since there are benefits to having source-specific cell means, we urge
the U.S. Census Bureau to consider adjusting the public topcodes for each income source
annually with the topcode set at the highest possible income point for that income source without
lowering the population who are topcoded to below 5, except when this could unduly risk the
confidentially of respondents.
For labor income sources where demographic sub-cells are provided, avoiding
combinations across sub-cells is still beneficial but the cost of doing so is much greater. While
the topcode for a non-labor income source can be dropped just enough to topcode an additional
one or two individuals and hence produce a separate cell mean for a given non-labor income
source, if the topcode is lowered for a labor income source to provide a separate cell mean for
one demographic group, the topcode must be lowered for all demographic groups from that labor
source. As a result, obtaining this separate cell mean for labor income demographic groups may
come at the cost of topcoding dozens of additional people. Thus, for labor income sources, the

21

U.S. Census Bureau should focus on setting topcodes at the highest possible levels even if it
requires combining additional demographic groups for that labor income source when producing
cell means.
The U.S. Census Bureau should also make the general public more aware of the problem
of inconsistent censoring in the internal March CPS, now that the public use March CPS is better
able to match internal March CPS income levels and trends. Even using our cell mean series, the
public use March CPS will still reflect time-inconsistencies caused by different levels of
censoring in the internal March CPS data over time. The U.S. Census Bureau should consider
keeping the point where these internal censoring points hit the distribution of income for a given
income source consistent over time. This is especially true since the lack of publicly available
March CPS data around these internal censoring points limits researchers’ ability to self-generate
consistent trends when topcodes increase. Additionally, given their increased importance, it
would be prudent to include the internal censoring levels in the documentation files for the
public use March CPS along with the public topcode levels. Doing so in a more prominent way
would better alert users of the public use March CPS to changes in these levels that could
influence the consistency of these data over time.
Despite these caveats, the cell means series provided to researchers in this paper through
the cooperation of the U.S. Census Bureau is of great value to the research community. When
used with the public use March CPS it will allow researchers to closely match the mean and the
distribution of income of the internal March CPS data for all March CPS years since 1976. No
other publicly available data set provides such a long term look at trends in income and income
distribution in the United States.

- Indicates that there are not enough observations to report a cell mean for this population group in this year. The reported cell mean is a combined cell mean
with the other footnoted population groups in the same year.
B
- Indicates that the internal censoring point is identical to the public cell mean so no additional information can be obtained from the internal data.
C
- Interest income in 1984 does not properly match between the internal and the public data. This cell mean is based on the 25 individuals with interest income
at or above $75,000 topcode threshold in the internal data, not just the 11 people who are listed as topcoded for interest income in the public data.
N/A – Indicates that no individual with these demographic characteristics were topcoded in this year from the specified income source
Note: In parentheses below each variable name is the mnemonic for the income source from the March Current Population Survey Technical Documentation.

Note: In the 1985 March CPS (income year 1984), six values for INCOMP exceeded $29,999 but were not top coded. In the calculations we did for this paper we
corrected this error and top coded these values at $29,999.

ENDNOTES
1

Each year the U.S. Census Bureau releases its yearly average income and poverty rates from the March CPS using

these data [9]. These official values are based on the internal March CPS data that is not available, except under
certain conditions, to researchers outside of the U.S. Census Bureau.

2

Each CPS survey captures income from the previous year. In this paper all references are to the survey year, so

when we discuss the year 1976, this refers to income from various sources that members of the household received
in 1975 reported on the March 1976 Current Population Survey.
3

There are two versions of the March CPS internal data. Both include information on income above the public use

topcode thresholds for respondents. But each is subject to some degree of censoring and thus do not include actual
incomes for the highest income earners. The data records we were provided include actual incomes in the March
CPS survey up to the processing limit in the March CPS data. This is the same version of the internal March CPS
data that the U.S. Census Bureau uses in it official publications (e.g. U.S. Census [9]). However, these processing
limits are lower than the data collection limits for income in the March CPS. That is, the limits on the actual values
collected in the March CPS (See Welniak [11] for a more complete discussion of the processing limits and data
collection limits).
4

Most of the U.S. Census Bureau procedures for creating cell means for topcoded values in the public use March

CPS data can be found in the 2007 Current Population Survey Annual Demographic File Technical Documentation
[10], but in some cases we learned about them via conversations with various U.S. Census Bureau employees
charged with creating the cell means.

5

We follow the same procedure for generating size-adjusted household income as discussed in Burkhauser and

Larrimore, 2008. Also see Gottschalk and Smeeding [5] for a review of the general income distribution literature
and Gottschalk and Danziger [6] for a more detailed discussion of these usual assumptions made in this literature.
