Transportation Choices and the Value of Statistical Life

JEL No. J17,O18
ABSTRACT
This paper exploits an unusual transportation setting to estimate the value of a statistical life (VSL).
We estimate the trade-offs individuals are willing to make between mortality risk and cost as they
travel to and from the international airport in Sierra Leone (which is separated from the capital Freetown
by a body of water), and choose from among multiple transport options – namely, ferry, helicopter,
hovercraft, and water taxi. The setting and original dataset allow us to address some typical omitted
variable concerns, and to compare VSL estimates for travelers from different countries, all facing the
same choice situation. The average VSL estimate for African travelers in the sample is US$577,000
compared to US$924,000 for non-African travelers. Individual job earnings can largely account for
this difference: Africans in the sample typically earn less than non-Africans. The data implies an income
elasticity of the VSL of 1.77. These revealed preference VSL estimates from a developing country
fill an important gap in the existing literature, and can be used for public policy purposes, including
in current debates within Sierra Leone regarding the desirability of constructing new transportation
infrastructure.

1. Introduction
This paper exploits an unusual transportation setting to estimate the value of a statistical life (VSL).
We estimate the trade-offs individuals choose to make between mortality risk and costs as they
travel to and from the international airport in Sierra Leone, which is separated from the capital
Freetown by a body of water. Travelers choose from among multiple transport options, namely,
ferry, helicopter, hovercraft, and water taxi. The setting and original dataset allow us to address
some typical omitted variable concerns in order to generate some of the first revealed preference
VSL estimates from a developing country, filling an important gap in existing literature.1 We are
also able to compare VSL estimates for travelers from 56 countries, including 20 African and 36
non-African countries, all facing the same choice situation.
One well-known methodological challenge in obtaining reliable VSL estimates is the
endogeneity of risks that individuals consider taking on (Ashenfelter 2006). The underlying
individual factors that affect the decision to enter into a risky situation – where in the existing
literature, risky job situations are often considered – may be correlated with many unobserved
individual characteristics. To credibly estimate the VSL, we would ideally exploit exogenous
events that affect the costs and/or the fatality risk individuals face, e.g., Ashenfelter and
Greenstone’s (2004b) use of legal changes to U.S. highway speed limits, which leads them to
estimate a VSL between US$1.0 and 1.5 million.
A strength of the study setting in the current paper is the fact that all individuals who wish
to travel to or from Sierra Leone by air need to choose among the available travel options to cross
from the international airport to Freetown. This partially overcomes typical concerns about
endogenous risk: while it is certainly possible that some foreign travelers are deterred by the risky
transport situation, many others will be compelled to travel to Sierra Leone for professional or
personal reasons. Moreover, all Sierra Leoneans seeking to fly abroad are inevitably faced with
the airport transportation choice, greatly reducing the degree of selection into the sample as a
function of individual risk attitudes for them in particular.

Greenstone and Jack (2013) argue that “there is hardly a more important topic for future study than developing
revealed preference measures of willingness to pay [for] … health” in developing countries.

We designed an original survey and administered it to 561 travelers in order to directly
observe respondents making actual transport choices to and from the airport. This survey collected
detailed information on a range of individual demographic, economic and attitudinal
characteristics, as well as on travelers’ perceptions about each of the different modes of transport,
allowing us to control for many potentially important confounding factors.
Another notable aspect of the study setting is the relatively good information environment
regarding transport risks in Sierra Leone. The rate of fatal accidents is high for the modes of
transport we study, and accidents are widely publicized in the local (and international) media and
the subject of frequent conversation in the capital. The topic of how best to travel between
Freetown and Lungi is commonly discussed among foreign travelers (as the authors can attest to
first hand, since precisely such a conversation was the genesis of the current paper). As we show
further below, there is relatively good knowledge among respondents about the relative risks of
the different modes of transport, and a particularly high degree of awareness about the riskiness of
helicopter transport, the mode with the greatest fatal accident risk.
It is also highly unusual to have individuals from so many countries all in the same dataset
and facing the same choice situation, and this allows us to generate comparable VSL estimates
across many nationalities. The average VSL estimate for non-African travelers in our sample, who
typically come from OECD countries, is US$924,000. This is slightly lower than most previous
estimates from rich countries, which typically use hedonic labor market approaches and range from
US$1 to 9.2 million,2 although we obviously cannot rule out that some selection into Sierra Leone
travel among the non-African travelers affects the estimates.
The only comparable revealed preference estimates available from less developed
countries (that we are aware of) are for manufacturing workers in India and Taiwan and range from
US$0.5 to 1 million (Liu et al. 1997 and Shanmugam 2001). These are in the same range as the
estimates for the African travelers in our data.3 Kremer et al. (2011) use a travel cost approach –
namely, willingness to walk longer distances to cleaner drinking water sources – to estimate the
2

See, for example: Viscusi and Aldy (2003); Ashenfelter and Greenstone (2004b), Lee et al (2012). Ashenfelter and
Greenstone (2004a) argue that estimates in this literature are subject to an upward publication bias.
3
In the African context, Deaton et al. (2009) use a subjective life evaluation approach, and find that the monetary
value attached to the death of a relative is only about 30 to 40% of average annual income, which is less than one
percent of most estimates for wealthy countries.

willingness to pay for avoiding a child diarrhea death by in a poor rural Kenyan region, and find
that such willingness to pay is very low in that setting, at under US$1,000.
The fact that the estimated VSL for African travelers is somewhat lower than for nonAfrican travelers (who are mainly from wealthy countries) is consistent with a growing body of
research that documents the relatively low demand for health and life in less developed countries.
The disease burden in low-income countries is much higher than in rich countries, and yet a
number of scholars have documented surprisingly low investments in preventive health
technologies (see Kremer and Miguel 2007; Kremer et al. 2011; Cohen and Dupas 2010). Common
explanations (surveyed in Dupas 2011) range from a lack of information about new health
technologies (Madajewicz et al 2007), pervasive liquidity constraints (Tarozzi et al 2013), time
inconsistent preferences (DellaVigna and Malmendier 2006), agency problems within the
household (Ashraf et al. 2010), shorter life expectancy (Oster 2009), cultural attitudes (and
especially fatalism, the belief that fate governs major life outcomes)4, and a high income elasticity
of demand for health expenditures (Hall and Jones 2007).
Our dataset was designed to assess the role played by these leading explanations. We find
strong evidence that individual earnings are positively correlated with the VSL, and that the
average income differential between Africans and non-Africans in our sample can account for
most of the gap in estimated VSL’s. However, in contrast, individual perceptions of life
expectancy, information about the modes of transport, and a range of attitudes, including those
regarding fatalism and religiosity, have far less predictive power in our sample. The bottom line
appears to be that individual economic conditions are key drivers of travelers’ transportation risk
choices, broadly in line with Hall and Jones (2007). The estimates imply an income elasticity of
the VSL of 1.77, which is in the upper end of the range of existing estimates, as discussed below.
These VSL estimates can be used for a variety of public policy purposes, including in
current debates within Sierra Leone regarding the desirability of constructing new transportation
infrastructure, such as a bridge from Freetown to the airport or a new international airport in a
different location. More broadly, public policy decisions regarding investments in environment,
health, and transportation often require estimates of a society’s willingness to pay to reduce the
4

Many scholarly accounts highlight fatalism as a widespread cultural attitude in many African societies (Iliffe 1995;
Fortes and Horton 1983; Bascom 1951).

mortality risks associated with alternative policies. These cost-benefit analyses reflect the dollar
amount that should be spent on transport safety in order to save a certain number of lives (in
expectation). For example, the California Department of Transport uses a VSL of US$2.7 million
when assessing road safety investments.5 Cost-benefit estimation of this sort is widespread in
wealthy countries. However, the lack of credible VSL estimates in most low-income countries
typically prevents the application of these methods for evaluating public projects, including the
large number of infrastructure projects that are currently being undertaken in Africa.
The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we introduce the setting, section 3
discusses the model and estimation strategy, section 4 describes the data, section 5 presents the
results. The final section discusses the potential public policy applications of our results, and
provides a back-of-the-envelope calculation evaluating the cost-effectiveness of an infrastructure
project that is currently being considered within Sierra Leone.
2. Background on Sierra Leone
To reach Sierra Leone’s Lungi International Airport from the capital of Freetown, travelers must
cross an estuary that is roughly 16 km across at its widest point (see map in Figure 1). There is no
bridge and it is estimated that the best ground transport option around the estuary would take over
six hours on unpaved and potentially dangerous roads, and thus we have no reports of travelers
ever choosing this option. All travelers arriving at Lungi Airport must choose between up to four
distinct transportation alternatives – the ferry, helicopter, hovercraft, or water taxi – to cross the
estuary. Each of the alternatives varies in terms of historical accident risk, trip duration and
monetary cost. Importantly for our estimation, fatal transportation accidents are widely reported
in the media and well-known to most travelers.6

The British High Commission advises (http://www.fco.gov.uk/): “Transport infrastructure is poor. None of the
options for transferring between the international airport at Lungi and Freetown are risk-free. You should study the
transfer options carefully before travelling”. A Sierra Leone tourism site (http://www.visitsierraleone.org/) writes that:
“Helicopters and Sierra Leone have a bit of a notorious past, with a couple of crashes widely reported”; and: “The
cheapest option of all is to take the ferry to Freetown but it is certainly not the quickest option”. The BBC reported
the following: “A helicopter ferrying passengers to Freetown airport in Sierra Leone has crashed, killing 19 people,
including Togo's Sports Minister Richard Attipoe.” (BBC News 2007). Bloomberg News reported on a ferry accident:
“105 people are feared to have drowned in Sierra Leone when a boat capsized.” (Bloomberg News 2009). Local
newspapers also regularly report on transport safety, including on a water taxi accident (along Sierra Leone’s coast):
“A passenger speed boat, Sea Master I, plying the Kissy Ferry Terminal/Tagrin route capsized at about 10:00 p.m. on
5

Table 1 presents summary statistics on the available modes of transport, and travelers’
perceptions of their attributes. The cheapest transport option is the ferry, at just US$2 per trip (or
US$5 in the so-called “VIP” section), though it is relatively slow, taking approximately 70 minutes
to cross the estuary. On the Freetown side, the ferry terminal is located on the east side of the city
at roughly the same distance from downtown (central) Freetown as the other modes’ terminals,
which are located on the west side (see Figure 1). On the Lungi Airport side, the ferry landings are
a greater distance from the airport (relative to the other modes), adding another 30 minutes in a
bus (and we factor in this additional time in our analysis). The ferry has the second worst recent
safety record of the four modes: since 2005, there have been three major fatal ferry accidents in
Sierra Leone (on all routes), almost certainly due to pervasive passenger overcrowding.
Accounting for the frequency of ferry trips and the average number of passengers, this translates
into a fatality risk of 4.43 per 100,000 passenger-trips.
The second mode of transport is the water taxi, a small craft able to accommodate 12 to 18
passengers. Although there have been multiple reports of these boats sailing without proper lights
or navigation systems, it appears empirically to be the safest option, with just one recorded accident
since it started operating, and an implied mortality risk of just 2.55 per 100,000 passenger-trips.
The water taxi takes approximately 45 minutes and costs US$40.
The intermittently available hovercraft has an observed fatality risk of 3.88 per 100,000
passengers-trips (in five separate accidents, two of them fatal, with 17 passenger deaths overall).
Its cost started at US$35 between December 2004 and May 2006, then rose to US$50 until April
2006. After a period in which it was out of service (following an accident), it reopened in
September 2010 charging US$60. In 2012 it reduced its price to US$40.7 The estimated travel time
is about 40 minutes. In the analysis below, we consider the hovercraft as a possible alternative
only during periods in which it was operating (see Figure 2).
Finally, the helicopter is the most expensive and also the fastest option, at only 10 minutes
to cross, yet has the worst accident record. The sole provider of the service used poorly maintained

In our data, which includes retrospective reports on prior trips, we include all options available at a given time point.

Soviet-era helicopters. Since 2005, there have been two helicopter crashes where all of the crew
and passengers died (Table 2). Taking into account the frequency of trips as well as the number of
passengers per trip, the historical fatality rate over 2005-2012 for helicopter transport is 18.41 per
100,000 passenger-trips, which is much higher than the three other modes and at least 30 times the
fatal accident rate per 100,000 flying-hours in U.S. helicopters.8
Our data collection effort includes retrospective reports from previous trips made by
passengers. The fact that particular options were unavailable at certain periods of time is actually
an advantage of our econometric identification strategy, as it provides largely exogenous variation
in the choice set travelers face over time. In many cases, we observe the same passenger making
transport choices at multiple points in time when facing different choice sets, providing more
information about their preferences. Appendix Figure A.1 shows the distribution of the trips
reported in our dataset: 41% of trips took place in the trimester of data collection, 23% took place
earlier in 2012, and 36% date back before 2012.
In our experience observing literally hundreds of trips (during surveying), there are
typically few or no transport capacity constraints: in other words, if a given mode of transport is
full at the scheduled time, there are more crafts available or additional trips can be made by the
existing fleet (i.e., there are usually extra water taxis parked at each dock, the helicopter can make
extra round trips, or more people can be squeezed onto the ferry). Additionally, it is notable that
the firms running the modes of transportation do not appear to be adjusting prices at high frequency
or in a particularly sophisticated manner. Figure 2 shows the price charged on each of the modes
of transport at over time. The ferry did not change its price at all during the study period, mostly
due to the government’s influence in setting the price, nor do the private firms running the other
modes appear to adjust their prices due to changing market conditions, i.e., variation in fuel costs,
or changes in the competitive environment when the supply of other transport services changes,
for instance, due to the frequent disruption of service for the helicopter and hovercraft (which
might lead other operators to raise their prices). For example, the water taxi has charged US$40
since it started operating, while the helicopter and hovercraft’s pricing strategies do not seem to
respond systematically to these other factors.

3. Estimating the Tradeoff between Mortality Risk and Cost
In this section, we lay out a standard discrete choice travel cost model. To convey the core intuition
of the model, the basic trade-off between VSL versus the value of time (i.e., the wage) is first
portrayed graphically in Figure 3 and then laid out formally below. Here we include three loci that
correspond to iso-utility curves for the main transport modes.9 The horizontal axis represents the
passenger’s hourly wage, and the vertical axis plots the VSL. The relative risk and cost profiles of
each transportation alternative determine the intercepts and slopes.
The water taxi is the least risky option but lies between the ferry and hovercraft in terms of
cost, as captured in both the ticket price and time (Figure 2). The fastest but riskiest option is the
helicopter, which is also the most expensive. As shown graphically, individuals with high wages
effectively choose between the helicopter and the hovercraft (since the long travel time on the ferry
generates high disutility). Those with sufficiently high value of life always choose the water taxi
since it is safest, while those with lower valuations choose between the helicopter and hovercraft
(if their wage is high) or pick the ferry (if their opportunity cost of time is low).
In essence, the VSL represents how much additional cost an individual is willing to take
on in order to reduce mortality risk a certain amount. This trade-off can be formally portrayed as:
(1)

𝑉𝑆𝐿𝑖 ≡

∆𝑊𝑖
∆𝑝𝑖

where ∆𝑊𝑖 is the change in individual i’s earnings for a reduction of ∆𝑝𝑖 in mortality risk.
We model traveler i’s decision to use transport alternative j (𝑗 ∈ 𝐽, for discrete finite J) to
travel between Lungi Airport and Freetown using a random utility model of discrete choice:10

where ∑𝑗 𝑦𝑖𝑗 = 1 and Pr(𝑦𝑖𝑗 ) > 0 ∀ 𝑗. Passenger i’s utility from choosing mode j is:

9

For clarity, the locus corresponding to equal utility for the ferry and helicopter is not shown since it lies in a region
where both options are dominated by the water taxi.
10
Greenstone et al (2012) use a related approach to estimate the VSL for military personnel making choices between
job assignments that entail different mortality risk and wages.
8

(2)

𝑈𝑖𝑗 = (1 − 𝑝𝑗 )𝑣𝑖 − (𝑐𝑗 + 𝑤𝑖 𝑡𝑗 ) + 𝜀𝑖𝑗 ,

∀𝑗

where 𝑣𝑖 represents the value to individual i from safely completing the trip, which happens with
probability (1 − 𝑝𝑗 ). 𝑐𝑗 is the monetary cost of transport mode j, 𝑤𝑖 𝑡𝑗 is the opportunity cost,
expressed in terms of the time it takes to complete the trip on j (tj) and the value of the individual’s
time (wage wi). It is convenient to define 𝑐𝑖𝑗 ≡ 𝑐𝑗 + 𝑤𝑖 𝑡𝑗 . 𝜀𝑖𝑗 is an i.i.d. type I extreme value error
∗
term unobserved by the researcher. The distributional assumption on 𝜀𝑖𝑗 implies that 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑘
= 𝜀𝑖𝑗 −

𝜀𝑖𝑘 follows the logistical distribution (∀ 𝑗 ≠ 𝑘).
Empirically, we estimate the VSL using a conditional logit model (McFadden 1974). The
probability of individual i selecting option j  J is given by:
(3)

Pr(𝑦𝑖𝑗 = 1) = ∑

exp((1−𝑝𝑗 )𝑣𝑖 −𝑐𝑖𝑗 )

𝑘 exp((1−𝑝𝑘 )𝑣𝑖 −𝑐𝑖𝑘 )

From this expression, the relative odds of choosing mode j over k is:

(4)

Pr(𝑦𝑖𝑗 =1)
Pr(𝑦𝑖𝑘

exp((1−𝑝𝑗 )𝑣 −𝑐𝑖𝑗 )

= exp((1−𝑝
=1)

𝑖

𝑘 )𝑣𝑖 −𝑐𝑖𝑘 )

= exp(𝑣𝑖 ((1 − 𝑝𝑗 ) − (1 − 𝑝𝑘 )) − (𝑐𝑖𝑗 − 𝑐𝑖𝑘 ))

Building on the expression in equation (4), and with an appropriate normalization of the
utility of the outside option k, the relative utility of choosing mode j is a function of the relative
survival hazard of mode j versus mode k ([(1 − 𝑝𝑗 ) − (1 − 𝑝𝑘 )], for 𝑗 ≠ 𝑘), and the relative cost
of taking the different modes of transport (𝑐𝑖𝑗 − 𝑐𝑖𝑘 ):
(5)

𝑈𝑖𝑗 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 ((1 − 𝑝𝑗 ) − (1 − 𝑝𝑘 )) + 𝛽2 (𝑐𝑖𝑗 −𝑐𝑖𝑘 ) + 𝜀𝑖𝑗

Totally differentiating equation (5), we obtain:
(6)

𝑑𝑈𝑖𝑗 =

𝜕𝑈𝑖𝑗
𝜕((1−𝑝𝑗 )−(1−𝑝𝑘 ))

𝜕𝑈𝑖𝑗

𝑑 ((1 − 𝑝𝑗 ) − (1 − 𝑝𝑘 )) + 𝜕[𝑐

𝑖𝑗 −𝑐𝑖𝑘 ]

𝑑(𝑐𝑖𝑗 −𝑐𝑖𝑘 )

Setting 𝑑𝑈𝑖𝑗 = 0 and recognizing that the coefficients 1 and 2 capture the relevant partial
derivatives on the key terms, this yields an expression for the value of statistical life that closely
resembles equation (1) above:
9

𝛽

− 𝛽1 =

(7)

2

𝑑(𝑐𝑖𝑗 −𝑐𝑖𝑘 )
𝑑((1−𝑝𝑗 )−(1−𝑝𝑘 ))

≈

∆𝑊𝑖
∆𝑝𝑖

𝛽1 represents the marginal change in the likelihood of choosing a certain transport mode due to a
change in the probability of survival, and intuitively this corresponds to the utility value of
completing a trip. 𝛽2 captures how the likelihood of choosing a mode changes with cost, and
corresponds to the monetary value of a unit of utility. The negative of the ratio of these coefficients
captures the trade-off between exposure to fatal risk and cost, which can be interpreted as the value
of statistical life.11
In section 5, we follow the framework presented above to estimate a conditional logit model,
and compute the average VSL for the different populations of travelers in our sample. Yet
conditional logit models, though simple to interpret and implement, have well-known limitations:
they impose the assumption of the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), and do not allow
for random taste variation across individuals or for correlation in unobserved factors over time
(Train 2003). We are able to relax these assumptions by using a mixed logit model (McFadden
and Train 2000). The IIA assumption is potentially problematic in our case since we have several
trips made by the same individual under different choice sets, due to the intermittent operation of
the hovercraft, the discontinuation of the helicopter service, and the introduction of the water taxi.
The IIA assumption implies that the relative odds of choosing between two particular options
remain constant when a new option is introduced. Further, conditional logit models assume that
all agents in the population have the same preferences.
This can be relaxed in a mixed logit model by allowing for random taste variation. We are able
to estimate individual level coefficients, and this allows us to recover the full distribution of the
VSL in the population. Mixed logit probabilities are the integrals of standard logit probabilities
over a distribution of parameters, as follows:

(8)

Pr(𝑦𝑖𝑗 = 1) = ∫ (

exp{[(1−𝑝𝑗 )𝑣 −𝑐𝑖𝑗 ](𝛽)}
𝑖

) 𝑓(𝛽)𝑑𝛽

∑𝑘 exp{[(1−𝑝𝑘 )𝑣 −𝑐𝑖𝑘 ](𝛽)}
𝑖

11

While in some cases measurement error in the explanatory variables leads to a bias toward zero and produces
estimates that are bounds on the true effect, a simple attenuation bias of this sort is unlikely to hold in this case. The
fact that the key statistic is a ratio makes it difficult to “sign” any bias generated by measurement error in the risk
and cost terms, in the absence of detailed information about the nature and extent of the measurement error.
10

𝑓(𝛽) is a density function and [(1 − 𝑝𝑗 )𝑣𝑖 − 𝑐𝑖𝑗 ](𝛽) is the observed portion of the utility, which
depends on the parameter vector β. The mixed logit probability is a weighted average of the logit
formula evaluated at different values of 𝛽, with the weights given by the mixing distribution 𝑓(𝛽).
The assumptions on the mixing distribution used for each random coefficient can be derived from
theory. For instance, it is likely that 𝛽1 is weakly positive for all passengers, if nobody prefers
higher mortality risk on a given trip. Likewise, 𝛽2 is plausibly weakly negative, implying that,
ceteris paribus, passengers prefer lower cost options.
Given our limited sample size, and the potential for reporting errors, we sought to use a
mixing distribution to minimize the possibility that outliers are driving our results. One distribution
that fits this criterion is the triangular. This distribution is continuous and symmetric, and we
constrain it to be weakly positive (weakly negative) for 𝛽1 (𝛽2). The simplicity of the distribution
makes estimation more tractable, and it is also attractive since it does not have the “thick tails” that
characterize some other distributions (such the log normal).12
4. Data
The Transportation Choice Survey was collected in August and September 2012 at both Lungi
Airport and Freetown, among travelers either arriving into or departing from Sierra Leone. We
verified that all three of the main transportation modes (ferry, hovercraft and water taxi) were
available on survey days; the helicopter was not operational during the months of the survey, but
we did gather information on past trips during periods when it was available. Enumerators recorded
each respondent’s observed transport choice, and the survey included self-reported choices on
earlier trips, namely on their immediately previous trip, and on their first two trips (if applicable),
meaning that travelers provided information on up to four trips in total.13
As noted above, an advantage of having historical trips in the analysis is that we are able to
observe individual choices at times when different options were available, including the helicopter.
In practice, this means that we have within-individual variation in the choice set, effectively
allowing us to obtain information on both individuals’ first and second choices in some cases,
12

Kremer et al (2011) also use a triangular mixing distribution in their travel cost analysis.
Appendix Figure A.1 presents the timing of trips (including historical trips) contained in our dataset between 2005
and 2012. To provide incentives to complete the survey for passengers who were in a rush to get to the airport or
home, each respondent received free cell phone air time worth about US$1 (enough for roughly 10 minutes of calls).

strengthening our econometric identification strategy. Further, the fact that we observe travelers
from high and low income countries alike facing the same choice situation allows us to generate
the first (to our knowledge) comparable revealed preference VSL estimates across nationalities.
Beyond the actual transportation choice, data was collected on respondents’ demographic
characteristics (including gender, age, nationality, permanent residence, and educational
attainment), and current employment status and earnings.14 Importantly, we ask respondents to
rank their perceptions regarding the comfort, noise levels, crowdedness, convenience of the
transfer location, and the overall “quality” of the clientele on each transport mode, allowing us to
explicitly control for each mode’s attributes in the analysis. We complement this survey data with
information on all transportation accidents and associated fatalities between January 2005 and
September 2012. This information was collected from the U.N.’s Engineering Department in
Freetown, and cross-checked by the authors with multiple local and international newspapers. The
list of all accidents is presented in Table 2.15
Table 3 presents descriptive statistics for the 561 respondents with complete information
on the relevant variables. Overall, including the historical trips, 57% of trips were made using the
ferry, 25% on the water taxi, 16% using the hovercraft, and 2% with the helicopter. Sixty percent
of the total sample is African, from 20 distinct African countries, while the 225 non-African
respondents come from 36 countries.16 The travelers are mostly business travelers, government
officials, or aid workers. Airport travelers in our sample are an average of 40.3 years old and 77%
are male (Table 3). They are highly educated – 81% hold at least a university degree – and have
relatively high incomes. Notably, our sample of African respondents is clearly “elite” in local
terms: they are both highly educated (77% hold a university degree) and have significantly higher
income than the average African, with a reported hourly wage of US$29.90 (PPP), or $62,360 per
14

About one third of respondents have missing values for their earnings and wages. We impute missing observations
with the average wage for other respondents with the same educational attainment category (namely, less than
university, some/completed university, post-graduate), continent of residence (Africa or non-Africa), and employment
sector (international organization/business, local organization/ business, unemployed).

There were additional helicopter accidents during the tail end of the civil war in 2001-2002, but we restrict attention
to the period when the war was definitively over, as it is most comparable to our post-conflict study period.

54% of the African respondents come from Sierra Leone, with the remainder from Nigeria (38% of non-Sierra
Leoneans), Ghana (20%), South Africa (17%), Kenya (4.1%), Senegal (3.9%), Liberia, Zambia and Guinea (1.9%
each), with smaller numbers from Zimbabwe (1.5%), Sudan and Gambia (1.4% each), Benin and Algeria (1.3% each),
and other countries. On the other hand, non-Africans come from the former colonizer (UK, with 34.3% of nonAfricans), followed by the USA (11.1%), India (9.4%), France (5.3%), China and Lebanon (3.7% each), Australia
(2.6%), Italy (1.9%), the Netherlands and the Philippines (1.6% each), Finland and Ireland (1.4% each), among others.

year, which is higher than median U.S. household income. They, too, are a mixture of local and
international business people, government officials and aid workers. Non-African respondents
have an even higher average hourly wage of US$47.60 (US$99,000 per year).
African respondents report that they expect to live for an additional 42.7 years (until 82
years of age) on average, while non-Africans’ stated remaining life expectancy is almost identical,
at just one year less. This may be surprising at first but seems consistent with the fact that the
African elites in our sample likely have good access to health care and are already 40 years old on
average (above the early childhood ages where most of Africa’s high mortality occurs). In terms
of attitudes, the African travelers have much more fatalistic beliefs than the non-African travelers.
When asked the extent to which they believe everything is determined by fate, versus believing
they are able to influence their own future, they have an average fatalism score of 4.2 (out of 10),
while non-Africans in the sample have an average of 3.3.17
Respondents report making transportation choices based on what appear to be largely
objective criteria, suggesting that they are relatively well-informed. Appendix Table A.1 shows
that most travelers who chose the ferry claim to do so because of its lower cost (64%) and safety
(84%); note that ferry passengers are not significantly poorer or less educated on average.
Travelers choosing the water taxi mention that their decision was based primarily on speed (85%)
and safety (43%), while those choosing the hovercraft base their choice on safety (80%) and speed
(73%). These patterns are broadly consistent with the intuition provided in Figure 3.
Further, the extent of information that passengers have about the mortality risk of each of
the modes of transport is shown in Figure 4. The questionnaire asked travelers to rank the transport
options based on their relative risk of fatal accidents. Overall, passenger perceptions are relatively
well, although not perfectly, aligned with the actual observed risk of a fatal accident across modes.
Consistent with the actual fatality risk, the helicopter is perceived as the most dangerous option by
65% of travelers, while over 25% think that the hovercraft is the second most dangerous. The ferry
is thought to be the second safest option by 24% of passengers, while 63% perceive it as the safest

Specifically, the question asked: “Some people feel they have completely free choice and control over their lives,
while other people feel that what they have no real effect on what happens to them. Please use this scale where 1
means "no choice at all" and 10 means "a great deal of choice" to indicate how much freedom of choice and control
you feel you have over the way your life turns out.” We reverse this index to create a measure of fatalism.

mode; this is a case in which perceptions depart somewhat from observed accident risk. The water
taxi’s safety features are also not clearly perceived by most travelers: 7% believe it is the safest
option while 24% believe it is the second safest mode.
5. Results
5.1. Value of Statistical Life Estimates
Table 4 shows the main conditional logit results. We regress the transportation choice indicator on
the probability of successfully completing the trip (presented at x1000 for clarity) and the total
travel cost. Each observation represents an individual trip, and is weighted to represent the true
proportion of passengers travelling on each of the modes of transport; that is, we weight each
observation by the inverse of its sampling probability, and we cluster standard errors at the
passenger level to account for the potential correlation in choices made by each passenger.18
As expected, passengers clearly prefer transport modes with lower accident risk and lower
cost. Column 1 in Table 4 shows an initial set of results for African travelers; we improve on this
specification in several ways below. Following equation (7), we use the coefficient estimates on
the safety and cost terms to estimate the average value of a statistical life. The estimated VSL is
significantly different from zero, at US$319,985 (PPP). Similarly, Column 3 shows the analogous
results for non-Africans. The estimates indicate that non-Africans are more sensitive to marginal
changes in fatality risk and less responsive to cost.19 The model suggests that the VSL for nonAfricans is an order of magnitude larger than for Africans, at US$2,586,708, but the confidence
interval in this case is large and includes zero.
A leading concern with the estimates presented in Columns 1 and 3 is omitted variable
bias. For example, the ferry is often quite crowded while it is also relatively safe but slow. Not
accounting for the correlation between the risk and cost terms and these other transport mode
characteristics could bias the coefficient estimate on the safety term. Similarly, many passengers
(including the authors) dislike the loud rotor noise of the helicopter. Since the helicopter is also

18

The sampling probabilities for each transport mode are defined as: (Overall proportion of travelers using transport
mode j) / (Proportion of survey respondents using transport mode j).
19
Some passengers do not pay for the trip themselves but are instead reimbursed. Our results are robust to the exclusion
of travelers who report that someone else paid for their trip (not shown). This is consistent with the fact that most of
the variation in the total cost of the trip is driven by differences in wages across individuals.
14

the most expensive option and least safe, there is a further correlation between the cost and risk
terms with a mode amenity that could again bias estimates. Likewise, the more expensive options
could also be more comfortable; this likely holds for the hovercraft (which has reasonably
comfortable seats, although it can get hot on board due to a lack of ventilation) but probably not
for the helicopter, and so on. The general point is that perceptions of the various amenities of the
different transport modes need to be accounted for in the analysis.
To address this issue, Columns 2 and 4 in Table 4 also account for individual level
perceptions, as recorded in the survey, on multiple attributes of each transport mode. Particularly,
we asked every passenger to rank specific attributes on a scale from 1 “very poor” to 5 “excellent”
(and then re-scale them from zero to one in the analysis). Individuals might not have direct
experience with each of the modes of transport but their perceptions are still relevant if they
influence choices. Once we account for perceived transport mode characteristics, both coefficients
of interest (on risk and cost) increase in magnitude compared to columns 1 and 3. The perceived
amenities are jointly significant in all specifications, justifying their inclusion.
Failing to account for transport mode attributes leads us to underestimate the VSL. The
estimated VSL accounting for the detailed transport controls are shown at the bottom of Columns
2 and 4. The estimated VSL for Africans rises to US$778,492 (statistically different from zero at
95% confidence), while non-Africans have an average VSL of US$2,960,968 (although zero is
again contained in the 95% confidence interval). Column 5 shows the results for the pooled sample,
formally testing for the equality of the coefficient estimates across Africans and non-Africans.
Differences between African and non-African travelers are driven by the coefficient on the total
cost of the trip, with Africans less likely to choose the more expensive options.
A key assumption of our model is that travelers are well informed about accident risk.
Results from our survey indicate that travelers are aware of the broad ranking of safety (i.e., the
helicopter is riskiest, but many think the ferry is relatively safer than it is, etc.). Another way to
assess the role of information is to test whether the estimated VSL differs for those travelers who
are likely to be objectively better informed about travel risks. As one approach, it is reasonable to
assume that Sierra Leonean travelers are generally more knowledgeable about the relevant risks
than foreigners: all of the accidents were widely reported in the local media and the issue was even

15

commented upon by the President.20 At the same time, Sierra Leonean airport travelers exhibit
similar observable characteristics to the other African travelers in terms of education and earnings.
If it were indeed the case that foreigners were less informed than locals about accident risk, this
would be reflected in their choices, and thus they should exhibit a different VSL.
Appendix Table A.2 reports the model’s results only for the Sierra Leonean subsample,
and compares them to the results for other Africans, both with and without controls for the
perceived quality of transport mode attributes. The coefficients associated with the probability of
completing the trip and cost are not statistically different between these two groups, which is
consistent with the assumption that information regarding fatality risk was broadly similar in the
two groups. Along the same lines, first-time travelers to or from Lungi airport could conceivably
be less knowledgeable about the relevant risks than more seasoned travelers. When we carry out
the analogous estimation excluding all reported trips by first-time Lungi travelers, all the main
patterns described above are unchanged (see Appendix Table A.3), again suggesting that poor
information about risks is not the key driver of the estimates.
5.2. Mixed Logit Results
We next present estimates using our preferred mixed logit model in Table 5, under the assumption
that the coefficients associated with the probability of completing the trip and the total
transportation cost both follow a triangular distribution. In all regressions, we also control for the
perceived quality of the different attributes for each mode of transport, as above, and assume that
tastes over these qualities are fixed for tractability.
The mixed logit model leads to higher mean estimates of the coefficients associated with both
the probability of completing the trip and its opportunity cost, both for Africans and non-Africans.
The implied average VSL for African travelers is now US$577,129, while for non-Africans it is
US$923,928. Both estimates are significantly different from zero, but not statistically significantly
different from each other. For the case of the non-African travelers, the difference between the
estimated mean VSL with the conditional logit and the one obtained here is mostly driven by a
difference in the coefficients associated with the cost of the trip, which becomes larger in the mixed

20

16

logit estimation (Column 2 of Table 5).21 We are able to generate the distribution of the VSL
across individuals using the mixed logit model, and the distributions for both Africans and nonAfricans are displayed in Figure 5. There is considerable overlap between the two distributions,
but the non-African distribution lies to the right of the distribution for African travelers; the next
sub-section explores this difference further.
Policy analysts frequently apply VSL estimates from one setting to different regions or
different points in time, where average income levels may differ, and to do so they often employ
estimates of the income elasticity of the VSL (see Hammitt and Robinson 2011). Currently, there
is debate over the empirical income elasticity of the VSL, with estimates ranging between 0.4 and
1.7. For example, the contingent valuation studies reviewed in Viscusi and Adly (2003) typically
estimate elasticities less than one, ranging between 0.4-0.6. Many longitudinal studies estimate an
elasticity greater than one: Costa and Khan (2004) estimate an elasticity ranging between 1.5 and
1.7, and Hall and Jones (2007) argue for an elasticity of 1.2. In Table 6 we estimate of the income
elasticity of the VSL in our data by regressing the log of the VSL (generated at the individual level
in the mixed logit model) on the log of the individual hourly wage rate.22 In our sample, we
estimate an elasticity of 1.77, with very similar estimates for Africans and non-Africans. This lies
at the upper end of the range of existing estimates, and implies that the VSL increases rapidly with
rising individual income.
5.3. What explains differences between Africans and non-Africans?
Although there are no statistically significant differences in mean VSL estimates across Africans
and non-Africans in our sample of airport travelers, the mean estimate for non-Africans is roughly
twice as large as that for Africans, and this gap merits further explanation. Three leading
hypothesis in the literature could potentially account for the lower estimates among Africans. First,
people with a shorter remaining life span might rationally invest less in marginal reductions in
mortality risk (Oster 2009). Second, in the African context it has sometimes been argued (mainly
by non-economists) that there is considerable cultural “acceptance” of morbidity and mortality

21

We also estimated models in which we assumed that the random coefficients are distributed normally. The median
implied VSL values are similar to those reported in Table 5 for both Africans and non-Africans (not shown), but the
mixed logit estimates are less precisely estimated using normal mixing distributions.
22
The relatively few travelers (approximately 6%) who report zero wage earnings are dropped from this analysis.
17

risk, which itself may be an expression of pervasive fatalism (Fortes and Horton 1983; Caldwell
2000; Meyer-Weitz 2005). Third, it has been hypothesized that expenditures in life-prolonging
technologies are highly sensitive to income (Hall and Jones 2007), and thus poorer individuals will
have a far lower VSL. We next present evidence that casts some doubt on the first two hypotheses
(and several other potential explanations), and provide suggestive evidence that income
differences are a more likely explanation for the patterns in the data.
To start, the different choices made by Africans and non-Africans do not seem to arise from
differential perceptions regarding the amenity value of the modes of transport, which are similar
(Figure 6, Panel A). However, there are substantial differences in the wages of the two groups,
with non-Africans earning considerably more (Panel B). Africans and non-Africans also expect to
live for roughly the same number of additional years, with nearly identical distributions (Panel C),
suggesting that individual life expectancy is unlikely to be a key driver. 23 Finally, and consistent
with previous evidence, Africans in our sample express significantly more fatalistic views than the
non-Africans (Panel D).
We next examine the extent to which these variables can account for differences between
Africans and non-Africans in our data. As a benchmark, Column 1 in Table 7 reproduces the
regression from Column 5 in Table 4, which shows that Africans are no more sensitive to
differences in fatality risk but do appear to be more sensitive to total trip cost (including the
opportunity cost of time). Column 2 augments the specification by controlling for interactions with
individual level observable characteristics, including gender, age, education, having children,
exposure to armed conflict, and whether the respondent can swim (which might be relevant for
assessing risk when taking the sea transport modes). These controls are included as interaction
terms with the probability of completing the trip and the total trip cost (with all variables demeaned in the interaction terms). Note that the introduction of these variables in the regression
does not alter either the statistical significance or magnitude of the interaction between the African
indicator variable and trip cost (or the other coefficients of interest).
In Columns 3, 4, and 5 of Table 7, we progressively include further interactions with the
characteristics presented in Panels B, C, and D of Figure 6. Finally, in column 6 we include the
23

year increments until the respondent answered in the negative.
18

full set of interactions jointly and this yields the most convincing set of findings. The coefficient
estimate on the interaction between cost and the individual wage is robustly large, negative and
significant at 99% confidence. Including this Cost x Wage term also reduces the magnitude and
statistical significance of the Cost x African coefficient estimate by 90 percent, and thus appears
to account for the bulk of the difference in VSL estimates between Africans and non-Africans.
6. Summary and Discussion
This paper exploits an unusual transportation setting to provide revealed preference estimates of
the value of statistical life (VSL). We observe the trade-offs individuals are willing to make
between mortality risk and travel costs among those traveling to and from the international airport
in Sierra Leone among multiple transport options with different characteristics. The study setting
and data allows us to partially overcome some typical problems faced in VSL estimation. While
differences between Africans and non-Africans are not statistically significant, we find that
African travelers appear somewhat less willing to pay for reduced mortality risk, with an average
VSL of US$577,000 compared to US$924,000 for the non-African travelers. We show suggestive
evidence that this difference can be largely accounted for by differences in the average job earnings
between the two groups.
The value of a statistical life is a key public policy parameter frequently used to evaluate
the cost effectiveness of infrastructure and environmental projects that affect mortality risk. The
VSL estimates in this paper are thus potentially of great interest in Sub-Saharan Africa, which is
currently one of the world’s fastest growing regions and is experiencing a boom in large-scale
infrastructure projects (World Bank 2013). However, until now there have been few credible
revealed preferences VSL estimates in Africa (or other low income regions).
The VSL estimates we generate may be directly applicable in evaluating potential
infrastructure projects in Sierra Leone itself. To illustrate one such project, on July 2nd 2013, Sierra
Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma met with China’s president and vice-president to discuss three
large infrastructure projects to be potentially financed with Chinese investment.24 Importantly, one
of the projects under discussion was the construction of an entirely new international airport, which
would be located closer to the capital of Freetown, allowing travelers to drive to the capital by
24

19

road and thus avoid the harrowing journey that is the backdrop of the current study. The initial
estimated cost of the potential project is said to be approximately US$300 million. Using this rough
cost estimate, our own VSL estimates for African airport travelers, and making some conservative
assumptions regarding the reduction in mortality risk generated by eliminating the Lungi-Freetown
trip, we are able to provide a back-of-the-envelope calculation regarding some of the social
benefits generated by the proposed project.
We first assume that the ground transportation will only be as safe as the safest existing
transport mode, namely the water taxi, at 2.55 fatalities per 100,000 passenger trips. Road travel
is likely to be considerably safer, but this is a conservative starting point. Given that the actual
weighted mortality risk is 3.90 fatalities per 100,000 passenger trips (taking appropriate averages
in Table 1), this implies a reduction in mortality risk of approximately a third, or 1.35 per 100,000
passenger trips.
Lungi International Airport’s passenger traffic is currently roughly 14,000 passengers per
week.25 We assume that passenger traffic to the new airport (if and when constructed) will remain
constant at this level, which means that the total yearly passenger traffic in the new airport would
be approximately 700,000 passengers per year. This again appears very conservative given the
rapid increase in total population and in business travel to Sierra Leone in recent years.
Using these two assumptions, the new airport would save approximately 1.35/100,000 x
700,000 passengers = 9.45 lives per year. Using the estimated VSL for Africans air travelers, this
implies a social benefit of US$5.5 million per year. If the government or social planner discounts
at 10% per year, the net present value of this benefit is approximately US$60 million. While this
figure does not fully “pay for” the initial US$300 million cost estimate, it goes a long way towards
justifying such an expense despite being driven by conservative assumptions on the reduction in
accident risk and future air travel, and of course it does not account for all of the other intended
benefits of a new airport in terms of international trade and economic growth. This rough
calculation illustrates how useful a more empirically grounded VSL estimate can be as an input
into public policy decisions in African and other low income settings. Finally, it is worth noting

25

The approximate number of passengers per week was obtained for July 2013 by collecting data on all flights arriving
and departing from the airport in a given week, assuming nearly full flights (95% of capacity), and accounting for the
passenger capacity of each aircraft.
20

that, given Africa’s rapid current economic growth rates, our finding of a large positive income
elasticity implies that value of life estimates are likely to risk rapidly in the coming years, and this
too is a trend that will be useful to factor into public policy analyses there.

Source: Transportation Choice Survey 2012. Each respondent was asked: “When travelling by road, air or water there
are chances that an accident happens, and someone dies in the accident. Even though the chances that a fatal accident
occurs are small, some modes of transport are safer than others. Moreover, these risks can change depending on the
weather conditions (or the seasons). In terms of the chances of having a fatal accident on a day like today (in the rainy
season, between May and September), that is, the chances that the mode of transport taken crashes, and a person like
you dies in the crash: How would you rank the transport modes, from the safest to the most dangerous one?” The
figure portrays the results from this question. The same question was asked for the dry season, and the results are very
similar.

while other people feel that what they have no real effect on what happens to them. Please use this scale where 1
means "no choice at all" and 10 means "a great deal of choice" to indicate how much freedom of choice and control
you feel you have over the way your life turns out”. This scale was then inverted so that 10 denotes “no choice at all”
to capture fatalism.

Sources: Information on fatal accidents was obtained by a comprehensive search of Sierra Leone and international
newspapers during the period January 2005 through June 2012, the UN engineering department in Freetown, as well
as several news sources. Information on the monetary cost and travel time were obtained during fieldwork in August
2012. The probability of an accident is computed as the ratio of the total number of accidents observed during the
reference period, divided by the number of trips made by transport during the same period, taking into account the
breaks in service for each mode of transport. Similarly, the probability of a fatal accident is computed as the ratio of
the number of fatalities observed during the reference period, divided by the estimated number of passengers that
made a trip during the same period. Information on choices was collected in the 2012 Sierra Leone Survey on
Transportation Choices. To get information about the average time of the trip, the researchers did each trip from the
airport to Freetown multiple times.

Notes: “Africans” includes Sierra Leoneans. Panel A shows statistics for all trips recorded in the dataset (1793 overall,
1083 Africans, 710 Non-Africans). Panel B shows descriptive statistics at the individual traveler level (N shown in
the table header). All statistics are weighted to represent the observed proportions of the population taking each mode
of transport. The PPP exchange rates come from the World Bank's World Development Indicators. The conversion to
PPP uses the country of residence of the respondent. Wage imputations are based on three education categories (high
school or less, some or completed university, and post graduate), region of residence (African / non-African), and job
status (Government, international organization or private business outside Sierra Leone; Local NGO, local business,
academic/research/education; Student/Unemployed). 447 out of 561 respondents reported their wages (270 of 337
Africans, and 177 of 225 Non-Africans).

Notes: The data are from a survey applied to travelers in August-September 2012. The probability of completing the trip
is defined as the one minus the probability of being in an accident and dying (x1000). Each observation in is a unique
traveler-transportation mode pair in the current choice. The dependent variable is an indicator equaling 1 if the traveler
chose the transportation mode represented in the traveler-transportation mode pair. In every choice situation, we consider
only the transportation modes available (i.e., the hovercraft or the helicopter are unavailable in certain months), and limit
the sample to trips that took place in January 2005 of later. All regressions are weighed to be representative to the actual
share of travelers taking each individual mode of transport. Standard errors below each point estimate are clustered at the
level of the individual decision-maker, significantly different than zero at 90% (*), 95% (**), 99% (***) confidence. The
VSL is the ratio of the coefficient estimates on the probability of completing the trip term over the total cost term, and its
standard error is estimated using the delta method.

observed ranking of the quality of the mode of transport (Comfort, Noise, Crowdedness, Convenience of location,
and quality of the clientele). Columns 2-6 also include interactions between the probability of completing the trip
and cost of the trip and observable individual characteristics such as age, gender, university degree, has children,
has been affected by conflict, and knows how to swim (not shown). All terms in the interactions are de-meaned.
All regressions are weighed to be representative to the actual share of travelers taking each individual mode of
transport. Standard errors below each point estimate are clustered at the level of the individual decision-maker,
significantly different than zero at 90% (*), 95% (**), 99% (***) confidence. The VSL is the ratio of the

Notes: In this table, each observation represents a single passenger observation. All statistics are weighted
to represent the true proportions of the population taking each mode of transport. The PPP exchange rates
used correspond to 2011 (2012 are still not available), from the World Bank's World Development
Indicators. The conversion to PPP uses the country of residence of the respondent. Wage imputations are
based on three education categories (high school or less, some or completed university, and post graduate),
region of residence (African / non-African), and job status (Government, international organization or
private business outside Sierra Leone; Local NGO, local business, academic/research/education;
Student/Unemployed). 447 out of 562 respondents reported their wages (270 of 337 Africans, 177 of 225
Non-Africans).

Notes: The data are from a survey applied to travelers in August-September 2012. The probability of completing the trip
is defined as the one minus the probability of being in an accident and dying (x1000). Each observation in is a unique
traveler-transportation mode pair in the current choice. The dependent variable is an indicator equaling 1 if the traveler
chose the transportation mode represented in the traveler-transportation mode pair. In every choice situation, we consider
only the transportation modes available (i.e., the hovercraft or the helicopter are sometimes unavailable), and limit the
sample to trips that took place in January 2005 of later. All regressions are weighed to be representative to the actual share
of travelers taking each individual mode of transport. Standard errors below each point estimate are clustered at the level
of the individual decision-maker, significantly different than zero at 90% (*), 95% (**), 99% (***) confidence. The VSL
is the ratio of the coefficient estimates on the probability of completing the trip term over the total cost term, and its standard
error is estimated using the delta method.
