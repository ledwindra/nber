Real-Time Macroeconomic Monitoring: Real Activity, Inflation, and Interactions
S. Boragan Aruoba and Francis X. Diebold
NBER Working Paper No. 15657
January 2010
JEL No. E3
ABSTRACT
We sketch a framework for monitoring macroeconomic activity in real-time and push it in new directions.
In particular, we focus not only on real activity, which has received most attention to date, but also
on inflation and its interaction with real activity. As for the recent recession, we find that (1) it likely
ended around July 2009; (2) its most extreme aspects concern a real activity decline that was unusually
long but less unusually deep, and an inflation decline that was unusually deep but brief; and (3) its
real activity and inflation interactions were strongly positive, consistent with an adverse demand shock.

Introduction

Real economic agents, making real decisions in real time, need accurate and timely estimates
of the state of macroeconomic activity. Every day, literally millions of economic agents (business people, retail and institutional investors, financial institutions, economists, households,
...) explicitly or implicitly attempt to form and update views on macroeconomic activity
as new information arrives. Significant parts, for example, of the first few pages of any
day’s Wall Street Journal or Financial Times are typically devoted to recently-released or
soon-to-be-released data and its likely implications for business conditions.
To help meet this demand, we have earlier supplied and illustrated a framework for
high-frequency measurement of macroeconomic activity in a systematic, replicable, and statistically optimal manner in Aruoba et al. (2009).1 We are hardly alone in appreciating the
desirability and benefits of high-frequency measurement, however, as interest in the area has
escalated rapidly. Academic research on high-frequency (indeed real-time) macroeconomic
measurement is now voluminous, with leading reference works featuring it prominently (e.g.,
Croushore (2006)), and recently-established annual conferences chronicling and promoting
new developments.2 Even Google is now in the game, as industry and academics work
together to expand the frontier; see Choi and Varian (2009).
Improved real-time macroeconomic measurement is of interest not only to private agents,
but also to policy makers. Both groups seek to use better information to make better decisions. Hence central banks and NGOs worldwide have recently devoted significant resources
to real-time macroeconomic monitoring, as for example with the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia’s Real-Time Data Research Center3 , the Bank of Italy and CEPR’s EuroCOIN
project4 , and the Bank of Spain’s Euro-STING project.5
Similarly, leading policy-oriented academic macroeconomists are focusing squarely on
real-time challenges, grappling with policy formulation and evaluation in the face of evolving
current information, as for example in John Taylor’s inaugural Feldstein address to the NBER
(Taylor (2009)).

Against this background, in this paper we provide both retrospective and prospective
assessment of progress in real-time macroeconomic monitoring. We focus not only on real
macroeconomic activity, which has received most attention to date, but also on inflation and
its interaction with real activity. In section 1 we present our basic dynamic factor framework,
which we use throughout. In section 2 we use the framework to assess real activity (section
2.A), inflation (section 2.B), and their interaction (section 2.C). We conclude in section 3.

A Dynamic Factor Model for Economic Indicators

Our concern is with accurate real-time assessment of current macroeconomic activity; that
is, our concern is with “nowcasting,” not forecasting. Accurate nowcasting promotes good
decision making, and although far from simple, nowcasting can likely be done with greater
success than longer-horizon forecasting.6 We work in a “small data” environment in the
sense of Diebold (2003), with roughly a half-dozen indicators of economic activity.7 We
prefer small data because it lets us devote the necessary care and attention to the selection
and monitoring of indicators. In addition, recent work reveals that maximum-likelihood
estimation in small-data frameworks has surprisingly good properties, even when the true
data-generating process is “big-data”.8
We observe a variety of indicators, all of which contain information about the latent state
of economic activity. Hence we work in a state space framework with multiple indicators
and a single latent activity factor, which we extract optimally using the Kalman filter. We
use mixed-frequency data, specifying the model at high frequency and allowing for a large
amount of missing data (for the less-frequently observed variables).
Building directly on important earlier work of Stock and Watson (1989) and Mariano
and Murasawa (2003), we postulate dynamic factor structure at high frequency. (With no
loss of generality, call the highest frequency “daily”.) The latent macroeconomic activity
factor xt evolves daily with covariance-stationary autoregressive dynamics,
xt = ρ1 xt−1 + ... + ρp xt−p + ηt ,

(1)

where ηt is a white noise innovation with unit variance. The i -th covariance-stationary daily
6

In the jargon of business conditions indexes, we seek to produce coincident, not leading, indexes of
economic activity. Coincident indexes are more fundamental, as a leading index is simply a forecast of a
coincident index.
7
The exact number of indicators depends on the application, as we describe subsequently.

ŷti = ci + β i xt + γ1i ŷt−D
i + γ2 ŷt−(2D i ) + ... + γq i ŷt−(q i D i ) + εt ,

(2)

where Di is the number of days in the observational frequency of indicator i (e.g., Di =7 if ŷti
is observed weekly), and where the εit are white noise shocks, uncorrelated with each other
and with ηt .
Note that most indicators, although evolving daily, are not observed daily. If yti denotes ŷti observed at a lower frequency, then the relationship between yti and ŷti depends on
whether ŷti is a stock or flow variable. If ŷti is a stock, then yti = ŷti when yti is observed,

and yt is “missing” otherwise. Alternatively, if ŷt is a flow, then yt =

is observed, and is missing otherwise.
Our framework corresponds to a state space system: yt = Zαt +Γwt +εt , αt+1 = T αt +Rηt ,
εt ∼ (0, H), ηt ∼ (0, Q), t = 1, ..., T , where yt is a vector of observed variables, αt is a vector
of state variables, wt is a vector containing ones and lagged dependent variables, and T
denotes sample size. In general, yt will contain many missing observations, reflecting not
only missing daily data due to holidays, but also, and more importantly, the fact that most
variables are observed less often than daily. In addition, several of the system parameter
matrices may be time-varying, because of variation in Di across t (e.g., different months
contain different numbers of days). Note also that flow variables generally produce very highdimensional state vectors, because observed flow variables depend on xt and maxi {Di } − 1
lags of xt , which produces a state vector of dimension max{maxi {Di }, p}, in contrast to the
p-dimensional state associated with a system involving only stock variables.
Importantly for us, and despite the missing data and potentially time-varying system
matrices, the standard Kalman filter and associated likelihood evaluation via predictionerror decomposition remain valid in our environment, subject to some simple modifications.
This is well-known, as discussed for example in Durbin and Koopman (2001) and exploited in
Aruoba et al. (2009) and Aruoba and Diebold (2009). In addition, the “Harvey cumulator”
Harvey (1991) (pp. 313-318) eliminates the dimensionality problem by recognizing that the
state space measurement equation requires only the sums of current and Di − 1 lags of xt ,
not each of the summands separately. The upshot: We can use simple modifications of the
standard Kalman filter and smoother to produce exact maximum-likelihood estimates of our
model, and to produce optimal estimates of its latent macroeconomic activity factor, xt . We
now proceed to do so.

Monitoring Macroeconomic Activity

We have described real activity monitoring in Aruoba et al. (2009), and we have provided
enhancements in Aruoba and Diebold (2009). Indeed the so-called ADS Index is now maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, updated in real time and written to the
web whenever new data, or revisions of existing data, are released.9 Here we push the ADS
framework in new directions, focusing not only on real activity, but also on inflation and its
interaction with real activity.
To maximize transparency, in this paper we use a monthly base frequency for both
real activity and inflation analysis, eliminating many of the complications mentioned earlier
(time-varying system matrices, high-dimensional state vectors, etc.) We use indicators seasonally adjusted by the relevant reporting agency. We transform all indicators to logarithmic
changes; hence all are flows. We allow for p = 3 autoregressive lags in the transition equation
(1). We allow for q i = 3/Di own autoregressive lags in the measurement equation (2); that
is, we allow for one (quarterly) lag of quarterly variables, and we allow for three (monthly)
lags of monthly variables.

3.1

Real Activity

We use five indicators, from the 11/23/2009 data vintage: payroll employment (monthly,
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), 1960.02-2009.10), industrial production (monthly,
from the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), 1960.02-2009.10), real personal income less transfers
(monthly, from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), 1960.02-2009.09), real manufacturing and trade sales (monthly, from BEA, 1967.02-2009.08), and real GDP (quarterly, from
BEA, 1960.II-2009.III). Note in particular the different ending dates of the indicators in the
11/23/2009 vintage, as is typical, due to differing release timeliness.
We plot the five indicators in the top panel of Figure 1 together with NBER “recession
bars”.10 It is clear that idiosyncratic noise in the individual indicators masks much of the
real activity information contained in them. The extracted real activity factor, in contrast,
is much less noisy, as seen in the middle panel of Figure 1. The estimation results (not
shown to save space) reveal that all indicators load positively and significantly on the real
activity factor in our estimated equation (2). Conversely, the extracted factor is driven by
9

See http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/business-conditions-index.
As of the date of writing (January 2010), the NBER ending date for the recent recession remains
undeclared. We end the last recession bar in July 2009, which is when our real activity factor returns to
zero.

all of the underlying indicators. In optimally extracting the state of real activity, however,
the Kalman filter effectively eliminates much of the idiosyncratic noise by averaging both
over the cross section and over time.
Several features of our real activity index are noteworthy, as highlighted in Figure 2,
which contains real activity plots during 36-month windows containing the six most recent
recessions.11 First, movements in our real activity factor cohere strongly with the NBER
chronology, plunging during NBER recessions. Second, the roughly 1985-2007 “Great Moderation” in the volatility of real activity is clear, even if now relegated to the dustbin of
history. Third, the recent recession, which is of special interest, begins in very late 2007, in
accord with the NBER’s dating, and it shows a clear trough in January 2009, after which it
recovers steadily, with the recession ending (in our assessment) in July 2009.12 And finally,
Figure 3 emphasizes that the recent recession, although quite deep, is most notably very
long relative to its post-1960 competitors.13 The extreme duration severity interacts with
the moderately extreme depth severity to produce the extreme overall severity revealed in
the bottom panel of Figure 3.14

3.2

Inflation

Our approach to measuring inflation parallels precisely our approach to measuring real activity.15 As with real activity indicators, we see many inflation indicators, each of which
contains potentially valuable, but incomplete and noisy, information about the underlying
common component. We include wages among our indicators because they are a crucially
important price, and one not not explicitly contained in standard price indexes.
Our inclusion of wages has both theoretical and empirical nuances. On the theoretical
side, inclusion of wages is motivated by modern dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
models, which suggest that optimal monetary policy rules may be approximated by Taylor11

Each 36-month window begins 12 months before the corresponding recession.
The trough in September 2008 was caused by a set of exogenous events and should be discounted entirely. In particular, September industrial production was severely affected by a largely exogenous “triple
shock” (Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, and a strike at a major aircraft manufacturer), which caused an annualized September 2008 drop of nearly fifty percent and a correspondingly huge October rebound. September/October manufacturing and trade sales behaved similarly.
13
See Diebold and Rudebusch (1992) for discussion and analysis of recession durations.
14
We define duration severity to be recession length in months, depth severity to be the largest (absolute)
value of the real activity index during the recession, and overall severity to be the (absolute) sum of the real
activity index values during the recession.
15
Hence, for example, our focus is very different from the recent work of Reis and Watson (2009), who use
only prices of consumption goods and use a dynamic factor model to decompose them in a way that helps
make contact with modern theories of inflation dynamics.
12

5

type rules that respond to price inflation and wage inflation (e.g., Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe
(2007)) or even wage inflation exclusively (e.g., Levin et al. (2006)).
On the empirical side, inclusion of wages raises the issue of what wage indicator(s) to use.
Wage indicators effectively fall into one of two camps, “hourly compensation” or “unit labor
cost”. We focus on hourly compensation, as unit labor costs confound wage-rate movements
with productivity movements.
We use six inflation indicators from the 11/23/2009 data vintage: the all-items CPI
(monthly, from BLS, 1960.01-2009.10), the finished-goods PPI (monthly, from BLS, 1960.012009.10), a non-energy commodity price index (monthly, Standard and Poor’s GSCI NonEnergy Commodities Index, 1970.01-2009.10), a spot oil price (monthly, West Texas Intermediate, from FRB St. Louis FRED database, 1960.01-2009.10), the GDP deflator (quarterly,
from BEA, 1960.I-2009.III), and hourly compensation in the non-farm business sector (quarterly, from BLS, 1960.I-2009.III).
We again use the Kalman filter to estimate a simple dynamic factor model and extract
the latent state, resulting in an inflation index, which we show in the top panel of Figure 4.
The estimation results (not shown to save space) reveal that all indicators load significantly
on the factor in our estimated equation (2).
Several features of the top panel of Figure 4 deserve mention. First, the inflation of
the 1970s is apparent, as is its retreat, which began with Paul Volcker’s appointment as
Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in August 1979 and was accomplished by 1984.
Second, not only inflation’s level, but also its volatility, was low from then until the late
1990s. In contrast, inflation volatility shows a marked increase from the late 1990s onward, a
phenomenon potentially linked to inflation’s recent decreased forecastability, as documented
by Stock and Watson (2007). Finally, the recent period 2007-2009 is especially important, so
we zoom in on it in the bottom panel of Figure 4. The historically-unprecedented (at least
since 1960) 2008 inflation drop was extremely sharp but also extremely brief. The entire
episode ultimately lasted just six months.

3.3

Interactions

Prices and quantities should be related over the business cycle, and the nature of the relationship should convey information about the sources of shocks. (Demand shocks produce
positive price-quantity correlation and supply shocks produce negative price-quantity correlation.) Hence we now proceed to examine real activity and inflation together over the
cycle.
6

We plot our real activity and inflation indexes in the top panel of Figure 5, together with
NBER recession bars. We plot real activity on the left scale (thick font) and inflation on the
right (thin font), so that movements in the two series do not obscure one another. Movements
in real activity and inflation cohere over the business cycle, and crucially, the nature of the
coherence does indeed depend on whether recessions are demand- or supply-driven. The
inflation index tends to drop in most recessions, consistent with adverse demand shocks, as
for example in the “Volcker recession” of the early 1980s. In contrast, the mid-1970s and
1980 oil shock recessions show decreased real activity and increased inflation, consistent with
adverse supply shocks.
In the bottom panel of Figure 5 we zoom in on the recent recession. Inflation falls both
more sharply and later than real activity, plunging only in summer 2008, whereas real activity
begins its descent in 2007. Inflation also recovers both more sharply and sooner than real
activity, returning to baseline within approximately six months.
If differing descent and rebound patterns in real activity and inflation during the recent
recession are interesting, the similarities are also striking and ultimately more important.
The bottom panel of Figure 5 clearly shows strong positive co-movement of real activity and
inflation during the recent recession, consistent with an adverse demand shock.

Summary and Concluding Remarks

We have used a dynamic-factor approach to extract indexes of U.S. real activity and inflation.
Key aspects of our approach are its use of high-frequency data, its natural implementation
in a state-space environment via Kalman filtering, and its related natural facilitating of
real-time updating as data are released.
Historically, our real activity index closely matches the NBER chronology and captures
widely-discussed phenomena such as the “Great Moderation”. Our inflation index also follows the cycle, with the sign of the correlation varying, depending on whether various recessions are supply- or demand-driven.
The recent recession is of central interest, not least because of its severity. In terms
of real activity, our results indicate that it was the most severe since 1960. Interestingly,
however, its depth does not appear to be the most severe since 1960, as the the mid-1970s
and 1980 recessions were a bit deeper. Instead, the most unusual aspect of the recent
recession’s real activity movement is its duration. This extreme duration severity interacts
with the moderately extreme depth severity to produce very extreme overall severity. A

7

second extreme movement during the recent recession concerns inflation as opposed to real
activity, as the the 2008 collapse of inflation pressure appears to be the most pronounced
on record since 1960, by far. Finally, real activity and inflation appear strongly positively
correlated during the recent recession, consistent with a “traditional” Keynesian demandbased explanation. Indeed the recent recession, although the most severe during the last
fifty years – as by definition one or another must be – is similar in its essentials to most
others. Hence we are wary of assertions that “this time is different” not only with regard
to financial market booms (as emphasized by Reinhart and Rogoff (2009)), but also with
regard to business cycle busts.
The work begun here can be extended in several potentially fruitful directions. In work
in progress, for example, we assess the possible presence of regime-switching in extracted
factors, as in Diebold and Rudebusch (1996), both from the highbrow perspective of incorporating nonlinear aspects of the cycle, and from the pragmatic perspective of transforming
our indexes in ways that may enhance their interpretability. In addition we are extending our
framework to the global environment, estimating a hierarchical global dynamic factor model
in the tradition of Kose et al. (2003), with country indicators depending on country factors,
country factors potentially depending on regional factors, and regional factors potentially
depending on global factors.
