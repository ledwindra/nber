    "abstract": "\n\nYoung workers typically enter the professional labor market only after completing higher education. We investigate how earlier professional work experience affects skilled worker development. In a field experiment, 1,787 Engineering majors were randomly assigned to 6-month work terms to begin either in the second or third year of studies. Early exposure caused systematic differences in inclination to take Engineering elective courses, choice of major, and the probability of persisting in Engineering years later\u2014consistent with engagement, retention, and sorting effects. Early exposure notably increased academic and professional outcomes of lower-income students.\n\n",
