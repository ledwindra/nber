Macroeconomic Analyses and
Microeconomic Analyses
of Labor Supply

ABSTRACT

This paper reports on the current status of the microeconomic
research on labor supply behavior. The purpose is to direct attention to
microeconomic

research that may be helpful in the continuing evaluation of
aggregate models designed to explain the dynamic behavior of wages,
employment and unemployment. The approach is hopelessly empirical, and the
emphasis throughout is on models specified completely enough to allow
confrontation with the kind of data actually available.
The first part of the paper is addressed to microeconomists,
however. It is a brief attempt to provide a sketch of the stylized facts
that aggregate models of the labor market are meant to address. These

include (1) the serial 'persistence' in the change in unemployment (or
employment),

(2) the absence of persistence in the change in the real wage
rate, and (3) the continued existence of a negative correlation between
nominal price changes and unemployment rates.
The microeconomic (longitudinal) data turn out to be difficult to
square up with the simplest life—cycle models of labor supply. Contrary to
the predictions of the models, the data indicate that (i) average hours and
average real wages move in the same direction only some of the time, and
that (2) the within life—cycle, person—specific correlation between hours
and wages is negative. The microeconomic (experimental) data indicate other
puzzles. More elaborate models incorporating measurement error, non—
separable preferences, and unanticipated wage movements may explain these
findings, but they are also likely to contain parameters that are not
easily identified with the kind of data actually available.
Perhaps an alternative approach may be more fruitful in reconciling
the long run determination of hours worked by worker preferences with the
short run interaction of observed employment and earnings.

When it comes to public policy discussions of the labor market,

there is no doubt that th big picture of time—series movements in
unemploymet, employment and wages is the major topic of public concern. Since there is a great deal of active empirical microeconomic
research on labor markets, it seems natural to occasionally inquire as
to the implications of the findings from this research for the larger
issues of macroeconomics. I have often found that this is not always a
straightforward undertaking, however, as very little of this microeco—
nomic research is designed with an eye toward its broader implications.

This may be all for the best, as it keeps the microeconomists away from
the heat of battle and maybe also from the temptations to cook the

data. Nevertheless, it is often the case that a line of research will
cut across both macroeconoomic and microeconomic issues, and when this
does not happen, it may even be a signal that something is amiss in one
area or another.

In this paper, I report mainly on my perception of the current

status of the microeconomic research on labor supply behavior. The
purpose is to direct attention to microeconomic. research that may be

helpful in the continuing evaluation of aggregate models designed to

explain the dynamic behavior of wages, employment, and unemployment. My
approach is hopelessly empirical and the emphasis throughout is on
models specified completely enough to allow confrontation with the kind
of data actually available.
The first part of the paper is addressed to microeconomists,

however. It is a brief attempt to provide a sketch of the stylized facts

—2—

that aggregate models of the labor market are meant to address. The goal
here is to Lnnmarize for (a perhaps skeptical) reader some simple
empirical regularities that seem strong enough to deserve explanation.
If they are presented in a convincing enough fashion, perhaps even the
microeconomists will find them wQrthy of attention.

I. Facts and Theories of the Aggregate Labor Market

Although the catalogue could surely be longer, I would like to
emphasize three basic characteristics of the aggregate labor market that

must surely top the list of important empirical regularities. The first
of these is the high serial correlation or "persistence" in measures of the

change in unemployment (or employment). The existence of this persistence is relatively easy to document and its existence is rarely

questioned. Here I want only to indicate the nature of the serial
correlation and indicate its striking similarity in several countries.
The second empirical regularity I should like to emphasize is the
absence of persistence in measures of the change in the aggregate real

wage rate. Especially for the U.S., the aggregate real wage is very
close to a random walk (with drift) and only weakly correlated with

nominal variables. The absence of persistence in the change in the real
wage is less well known, and perhaps more difficult to document, than is
the presence of persistence in the change in the unemployment rate.
The third empirical regularity I should like to emphasize is the
consistent existence of a correlation between nominal price changes and

unemployment rates. The existence of this "Phillips Curve" relationship
is sometime1 doubted by the skeptics, although the high unemployment!
lower inflation experience of the last two years in the U.S.,

Canada,

and Europe must surely have caused even the doubters to think twice.
There is nevertheless plenty of room for skepticism about the nature and
even the existence of this relationship, so that the question of whether
a simple method exists for convincing the doubters may remain open.

A.

Persistence in the Change in Unemployment

The first three columns of Table 1 contain the fit of second—order
autoregressions to annual data on the unemployment rate for the U.S.,

the United Kingdom and Canada for various time periods. The results in
these tables reveal three relatively straightforward "facts about time—
series movements in aggregate unemployment. First, the unemployment
rate in none of these countries can be well represented by a simple
first—order autoregressive process. Shocks to unemployment result in the
hump—shaped moving average representation reported in columns 1—3 of
Table 2 for long time—series of annual data or for quarterly or monthly

data. These shocks first result in an increase and then a slow decline
in future unemployment rates. Quarterly results that demonstrate this
pattern have been extensively reported elsewhere for the U.S. and the

U.K. in the post—war period.1 It is not a pattern that results

solely from movements in the labor force, because a similar pattern

appears in uarterly U.S. employment data2 and in monthly U.S. data
on manhours worked.3

Second, the autoregressive (AR) structures for unemployment
sometimes bear a striking similarity across countries when fit for the

sane time period. Although far from identical, the AR(2) representations for the U.S., the U.K. and Canada are quite similar over the

period 1894—1983 in Table I. As a consequence, the moving—average
representations depicted in Table 2 are also similar.
Third, the exact empirical form of the persistence in the change in
the unemployment rate does not appear to be temporally stable over

long periods. This may be seen by comparing the AR(2) representations
for the 1894—1945 period with the same representations for the 1946—83

period in tables 1 and 2. The moving average representations
have a typical htmped shape in the longer period, but the impact of
innovations to unemployment is more damped in the Post—War period.

provides a very good fit to either quarterly or annual data. With trend
removal, ho&ever, these autoregressions always imply damped, slowly
decaying moving average representations.4
Columns 5—7 also report some very simple estimates of the effect of

lagged price changes on the real wage rate. In the post—War quarterly
data, at least, there is fairly strong evidence that rational forecasts
of real wage rate changes may be a negative function of current price

changes with an elasticity of —.3 to —.4. As we shall see, this is an
important result, because it provides one simple potential link between
a microeconomic model that emphasizes the role of real wage rates in the

detenination of labor supply and a macroeconomic model that admits a
role for nominal price changes in the determination of labor supply.

C. Price Changes and Unemployment

Figures 1, 2, and 3 contain plots of the inflation/unemployment combinations for the years 1893—1945 for the U.S. and the U.K., and for the

years 1921—1945 for Canada. Also indicated on each of these figures is
the area within which the inflation/unemployment combinations for the
years 1954—81 that are contained in Figures 4,5 and 6 would have fallen.
Although it is natural to focus attention on the data for the later
years contained in Figures 4,5 and 6, it is important to put these in

context. First, it is clear that until recently, at least, the Post—War

4This result also holds up in monthly data. See Kennan (1983).

range of U.S., Canadian, and U.K. unemployment experience has been

historicall! small. Second, it is obvious that the relationship between
inflation and unemployment appears very weak in the pre—War data.

Examining these data alone would have been very poor preparation for the
experience recorded in the 1950's and 1960's.

Indeed, it is especially interesting to consider how the contemporary inflation/unemployment data in Figures 4,5 and 6 would have

looked to an observer in 1970. This is easy enough to do since all of
the inflation/unemployment combinations after this year are in the

upper right—hand half of the figures. It is extremely tempting to
portray this as a sequence of short—run Phillips Curves that is con-

tinuously shifting up and to the right in these figures. Precisely how
these short—run and long—run relationships can coexist is presumably one
of the key questions that any aggregate model of the labor market is
meant to address.

Of course, in the face of the extraordinarily weak contemporaneous
correlations between inflation and unemployment that exist in both the
pre—War and post—War data, a skeptic might simply deny the existence of

any short run or long run relationship between these variables. One
simple set of facts that I have found useful in confronting the skep-

tics is contained in Figure 7. This figure contains the scatter diagram
of the difference between the Canadian and U.S. inflation rates against

the difference between the U.S. and Canadian unemployment rates. The
idea behind this comparison is a simple one, inspired, in part, by

—7-.

Lucas's

(1973) argument that price expectations might usefully be

treated as

latent variable in the determination of the deviation of

unemployment from its natural rate.' With similar slopes in their
short run Phillips Curves and similar price expectations, apart from a
random error, these inflation/unemployment differences will lie along a

common short run Phillips Curve. The very loosely determined and negatively sloped empirical relationship in Figure 7 suggests that there may
be something to this idea.

Table 4 contains the regression estimates of the relationship
depicted in Figure 7, except that the coefficients on the inflation rate

variable are unconstrained. As the table indicates, these coefficients
are remarkably well determined and insignificantly different from each

other. A similar analysis in Table 4 is somewhat less convincing when
U.K. and U.S. employment rate differences are examined. The equality of
regression coefficients on the U.K. and U.S. inflation rates is only
striking when a quadratic trend is included in the regression equation.

In my view It is importiant to find simple structural methods for

estimating the nature of the short run correlation between inflation and
unemployment so that this relationship can be sorted out from shifts in
the underlying determinants of structural (or "frictional" or "natural")

unemployment. So long as this is not possible, the simple correlation
between inflation and unemployment, whatever its sign, will

continue

to

be used by the general public as an Indication of causation. Just as
the negative correlation between these variables in the 1950's and
1960's was taken to imply that an increase in inflation might reduce
unemployment, the positive correlat ion that has

experience

materialized with the

of the 1970's is now taken to imply that a reduction in

inflation will reduce unemployment. I doubt whether either inference is
the appropriate one to draw from these data, but in the absence of a

and convincing demonstration to the contrary it is inevitable
that more will be inferred from these correlations than is appropriate
simple

for

wise public policy decisions. The simple analyses

in Figure 7 and

Table 4 are no doubt little more than an example of how a more convincing1 but simplified analysis might proceed.

1). Aggregate ltdels of Labor Supply

As

John Taylor

(1983) observes in a recant survey, much of the last

decade of research in macroeconomics has been inspired by a desire to
produce explicit structural models that might rationalize the Phillips

and Rapping(l969) and Lucas (1973) puts together a model of intertem—
poral labor supply with an assumption of rational expectations to do

this job. Lucas and Rapping observe that demand shifts are the logical
candidates for the cause of business cycle fluctuations in employment.
Maintaining the assi.ption of continuous market clearing, however,
requires that the short run labor supply curve be upward sloping or
these demand shifts will result in real wage movements without

corresponding movements in employment. Although long run labor supply
is known to be generally insensitive to the real wage rate, or even
backward bending [see Xillingsworth (1983)), in a simple intertemporal
model the short run elasticity of labor supply with respect to the real
wage must be strictly positive.

To complete the Phillips Curve rationalization a correlation between
short run movements in labor supply and changes in nominal prices must

still be established. Either of two routes may be taken. In the case set
out by Lucas (1973) workers may be incompletely informed about the

aggregate nominal wage, the aggregate price level, or both. In this
case workers may erroneously (but rationally) believe that their actual
unexpected nominal wage increases (or price decreases) are "good draws"

that will not be repeated. They will then want to capitalize on these
good draws to a greater or Lesser extent depending on the size of
their intertemporal labor supply elasticity.
Alternatively,

it may be the case that nominal prices or wages are

—10—

unspecified1 As Table 3 indicates, there is clearly some evidence based
on the historical record that simple forecasts of future real wage rates
might sensibly depend negatively on the current inflation rate, although
the elasticity is small.6 It follows that workers may reasonably

asstte that their current real wage rates are high, relative to what
they may expect in the future, when inflation rates are high. Again,
workers may use this information to capitalize on the "good draws" that
higher current price inflation implies they may be getting if there is
intertemporal substitution of labor supply.7
This intertemporal substitution model of the business cycle is

internally consistent, complete, and it is clearly amenable to econo-

metric testing. Most important of all, this macroeconomic model of the
labor market is entirely consistent in its logic with the microeconomic
models of labor supply behavior that have been the subject of considerable theoretical and empirical development over the last decade.8
Indeed, research that establishes the empirical adequacy of the
microeconomic models might even be taken to establish at least partial

credibility for the macroeconomic model. So long as the microecononists
are satisfied with the empirical success of models that assume the con—

employment and unemployment fluctuations since the early 1970's.

saying,

"Asreported econometric models go, ours can scarcely be called

successful, but we think its failures are suggestive along several

lines." They proceed to suggest that their findings are both empirically and theoretically consistent with a short run, but the absence of

a long run, inflation/unemployment tradeoff. Their main conclusion,
however, Is that the estimated empirical relationships are highly
unstable over time, and that a proper accounting of expectations may

increase

their explanatory power.10

This early empirical work by Lucas and Rapping predated the introduction of empirical methods for implementing the rational expectations
hypothesis about expectation formation, and for a while their original

empirical challenge was largely ignored. in an extremely thorough
recent study, Altonji (1982) takes up the challenge and continues the
careful empirical testing of the intertemporal substitution model in the

rational expectations framework. Altonji's (1982, p. 784) main conclusion is that the empirical results for a long time—series of annual data
in the U.S. do not support the intertemporal substitution model as a
structural explanation for aggregate fluctuations in employment because,
"For most specifications, the current real wage, the expected future
real wage, and the expected real rate of interest are either insignificantly related to unemployment and labour supply or have the wrong

sign." Although differing in detail, broadly similar conclusions on the
empirical weakness of the intertemporal substitution model as an expla—

nation of te aggregate data were reached early on by Sargent (1973),
and subsequently by Altonji and Ashenfelter (1980), Andrews and Nickell

(1982), Ashenfelter and Card (1982), and Kennan (1983). In all of these
studies, a major difficulty is the identification from the data of an
intertemporal labor supply elasticity that is (positive and) large
enough to reconcile the dramatically greater fluctuations in employment
than in wage rates that are observed.

There are, of course, many acknowledged difficulties in extracting

labor supply elasticities from aggregate time—series data. These
include problems of aggregation, simultaneity in the determination of
employment and wage rates, structural shifts in monetary policy rules

and in government employment policies, and the like. No doubt partly to

overco these difficulties, it is natural to turn to microeconomic studies of labor supply to see whether they have met with greater empirical
success and have resulted in more precise estimates of key parameters.
If some important parameters can be determined from the microeconomic
studies, these may naturally be included as the building blocks in more

persuasive aggregate models of employment fluctuations)1 The
question then remains as to how well these microeconomic models of

such methods. In many ways this is also the spirit of Kennan's (1983)

their reasonableness.

II. Hicroeconomic Evidence of Intertemporal Substitution
in Labor Supply

The empirical setting for microeconomic analyses of intertemporal

movements in labor supply must clearly be the life cycle. In fact,
setting out the simple theoretical models available serves two purposes.
First, it shows the clear connection between the life—cycle labor supply

model and the permanent income theory of consumption. Indeed, the
latter is simply the conswnption plan derived from the former, and per—
nanent income is nothing more than the appropriately discounted present

value of future wage rates. Second, to be tractable, the empirical analyses are going to require some form of linearity and some simple method
for stunmarizing a consumer—worker's future prospects. Intertemporally
additive utility and special functional forms are necessary to provide
the Justification for these simplifications.

A. Life—Cycle Labor Supply with Perfect Foresight

One simple txdel that generates a linear earnings function is the

Stone—Ceary utility function. In an intertemporal context this function
is additive both at a point in tine and over time. In particular, consider the utility function

denominator in this ratio be non—zero.

they are very unstable. Second, in three of the years con-

sidered they are lower than the actual mean of hours worked. Discarding
as extreme outliers the results for 1969—70 and 1973—74 leads to an

average ratio of the ratios Ih/ht

1.04 ,

which implies an intertem—

poral labor supply elasticity of .04. Obviously, with these data vir-

tually any estimate of Th may be obtained depending on what the
empirical analyst wants to see.

There are clearly difficulties in using this simple estimator to
calibrate the size and stability of the intertemporal labor supply

elasticity. Perhaps most disturbing are the possibility that aggregate
supply shocks or their determinants will obscure movements along the

supply schedule (4). ?tre generally, anything that might successfully
and correctly be removed from the panel data by the addition of year

dtmmy variables will produce a specification bias in these results. It
is important to emphasize, however, that the consistency of many of the
estimates of the intertemporal labor supply elasticity that I report
below are dependent on the sane assumptions necessary to ensure the consistency of the estimates of

in Table 5 and typically on further

a s 5 tmipt ions.

Ham and I have also fitted equation (4) to the P510 micro data

directly. These results are even more disappointing. We obtained very
precise estimates of

based on the pooled covariances in the data of

around 1,900 hours.- This result also implies a negative intertemporal
elasticity of labor supply.

A diffeent model that leads to a log linear labor supply function
has been suggested by Heckman and Macurdy (1980) and MaCurdy (1981). As
Abowd and Card (1983) observe, with a constant real interest rate and
negligible initial assets this model leads to precisely the log linear
labor supply function initially proposed by Lucas and Rapping (1970).

Table 6 are qualitatively consistent

with the results in Table 5 except for the year 1970—71. In general,
however, the data in Table 6 are far more congenial to an estimate of

magnitude.

Only two of the ten estimates of n

are

negative, and the

simple average of all the estimates is 1.14. Ileting the two extreme
outliers leads to an estimate of the intertemporal labor supply elasti-

city of .89. (This is equivalent to deleting the two estimates with the
denominators closest to zero in absolute value.) As before, however,
these estimates are very unstable and this instability casts serious
doubt on the credibility of this model.

There are several ways to use the covariances in the data to estimate ii

.

The simplest method is simply to compute the regression

coefficient of A ln h on A ln w •

Abowd and Card (1983) report all

of the necessary data to do this from the P510 and from the National

Longitudinal Survey of Older Men (NLS). Although it does not appear to
be widely reported in the literature, this regression coefficient is
always negative and significantly different from zero at quite small

probability levels. In the PSID it is —.36 and in the NTJS it is —.28

—21—

for the dat1 reported by Abowd and Card (1983).15
I do not want to suggest that it is impossible to use the covarian—
ces in the data to find a regression coefficient with the sign implied

by equation (5). For example, MaCurdy (1981) observes that adding

nA ln ht to both sides of (6) produces the relationship

This suggests computing the regression coefficient of the change in the

log of hours on the change in the log of earnings. In the P5W and WLS
data these regression coefficients imply estimates of n
and .61 ,

of around .78

respectively.

It does seen clear, however, that simple applications of either the
linear earnings equation (4) or the log linear hours equation (6) will
require some subtle manipulation of the data before they will produce

credible estimates of the intertenporal labor supply elasticity. As a
result, these estimates are likely to be sensitive to the model specified, although preliminary indications are that they are not likely to
be larger than .7 or .8.

3. ?tdels of Life—Cycle Labor Supply with Measurement Error

The presence of measurement error has been suggested as one impor-

tant reason for modifying equations (4) and (6). One suggestion is to

first became aware of this fact" after seeing Altonji's (1984) two
estimates of this regression coefficient. Using two different measures
of the wage rate from the PSID, Altonji reports estimates of the
regression of A ln h
on A in ht of —.40 and zero. The former is
essentially based on Fhe same data as reported by Abowd and Card (1983).

—22—

recognize thi presence of measurement error in both A in w and
A in ht at the micro level. As I have observed, the simple ratio of
means estimates in Tables 5 and 6 need not suffer from bias induced by

measurement error. kt the other hand, the usefulness of this simple
procedure depends critically on the assumption that unmeasured economy
wide shocks to real. interest rates or other aggregate variables can be
safely ignored.

Using the covariances in the panel data with time means

subtracted out does not run this risk.

MaCurdy (1981) circumvents these issues by estimating equation (5)

by an instrumental variables scheme. With time means subtracted out of

the data his estimates of the regression coefficient of A in h on
A in w are .10 and .15 with standard errors of about the same magnitude.

His estimates of the regression coefficient of A ln ht on

A in wh Imply estimates of r of .45 and .30 with standard errors of
about two—thirds these magnitudes. These are not large elasticities and
the imprecision of their estimation is disturbing.

The imprecision no

doubt results from the inevitably poor quality of what are essentially
time—invariant instrumental variables. 16

In an extremely thorough empirical study Altonji (l982b) reports
several efforts to account for measurement error in an attempt to

estimate (6). Be reports three alternative sets of results from the
PSID data. The first set uses an instrumental variables scheme designed

to reproduce MaCurdy's results. The estimated intertemporal labor

161t is well known that wage rates in a cross—section are roughly a
siilogarithmic function of schooling, experience, and experience
squared. The first—difference in the log wage is therefore approximately a linear function of experience, the main instrument available.

—23—
supply elasjicity falls in the range .08 to .50 depending on whether
time means are subtracted out of the data and whether age is included in

the labor supply equation. Estimated sampling errors fall in the range
.12 to .4, however1 so that elasticities are still imprecisely esti-

mated. A second procedure uses an alternative (but contemporaneously
measured) wage variable as an instrument for the wage in a classical

instrumental variables set up for handling measurement error, With this
procedure the estimates of the intertemporal substitution elasticity are

around .04 to .07, depending on specification. Estimated sampling
errors are very small also, at around .07, so that substitution elasti-

cities larger than .25 may be ruled out. In a third procedure Altonji
recognizes that a contemporaneously measured alternative wage variable
may be contaminated by common measurement errors or, in a txdel with

uncertainty, correlated with labor supply function errors. Using a
lagged alternative wage variable Altonji estimates intertemporal labor
supply elasticities around .05, but estimated sampling errors are now

around .45. All of these estimates rule out substitution elasticities

greater than unity. Altonji concludes that these estimates suggest an
intertemporal labor supply elasticity in the range 0 to .35, although I
prefer to state all these results and their limitations so that they
speak for themselves.

kltonji (1984) also presents estimates of 1

based on a procedure

that exploits the marginal condition for the consumption plan associated
with equation (5). The basic idea is that the marginal condition for

—24—

optimal contnption requires that

i/ct a Apt

,

so that equation (5)

can also be written as

(5a)

lnhaA+n lnw—n lnpc

Differencing this equation and using data on food consiunption in the

PSID, and an instrumental variables procedure, Altonji estimates n in
the range of .04 to .30 under various specifications. These estimates
have somewhat smaller sampling errors than those reported previously,

so that large estimates of the intertemporal labor supply elasticity may
be ruled out if these estimates are accepted.

Abowd and Card (1983) have presented some persuasive evidence that
much of the variation in both hours and earnings in the available longi-

tudinal data may be a result of measurement error. To see the nature of

this evidence consider any measured variable zt whose true value is

Abowd and Card present data that imply first—order autocorrelation
coefficients for hours and earnings in the PSID data of —.35 and —34.

—25—
Neither the #second nor third order autocorrelation coefficients in

their data are as large (in absolute value) as —.04. Although this is
hardly conclusive, it suggests the possibility that a substantial fraction of the panel data movement in hours and earnings may

be

composed

of measurement error. Indeed, Abowd and Card take the null hypothesis
against which they test equation (6) to be a simple model of measure-

ment error much like equation (8). Although they reject this model as
a complete explanation for the data, a major message in their paper is
the importance of dealing with this problem.
Altonji (1984) provides further evidence of measurement error in
the main wage series used in a typical panel data study of labor

supply. The change in the conventional wage measure in these studies is
the change in the ratio of labor earnings to annual hours at work.

For hourly workers in the PSID the change in the hourly wage rate,
is

also recorded. Assuming

This implies that 90 percent of the variance in w* and 72 percent

var (Awt*) > var (w), it follows that l_var(Awt*)/var(Aw) is a
lower bound on the percentage of the variance in

due to measure-

ment error of around 60 percent. I do not mean to suggest that the
wage change data contain only mesurement error.

Still, it seems clear

that the longitudinal data series available for identification of an
intertemporal labor supply elasticity are very noisy.

C.

Experimental Evidence on Labor Supply

By now there exist

several

experimental studies of labor supply, at

least one of which is designed to address the importance of the Hf e—
cycle

model as an

explanation for hours changes. These

studies are

experimental in the sense that families are randomly assigned to a nega-

tive income tax treatment or a control group. The Seattle—Denver
program is by far the largest, and it was designed explicitly to
address the effect of negative income tax programs of different lengths

on labor supply. It is precisely the possibility that a transitory
negative income tax program might have different effects on labor supply
from a permanent program that is at the heart of the life—cycle model.
Prom the standpoint of judging the transfer costs of a negative income
tax program, of course, this issue is mainly of concern in determining
the extent to which a short tent experiment simulates the impact of a
long term program, and this was the public policy issue being addressed.
Some very straightforward estimates of treatment effects from this

—27—

experiment are contained in Table 7. These are computed from coefficients on dummy variables that describe the particular treatments
indicated and that contain only pre—experimental measures of other

variables in the regressions. All of these estimates indicate a decline
in hours at work among the treatment groups relative to the control
groups, and many of these declines are statistically significant.
Since these are short duration programs, to the extent that the
life—cycle is the basis for decision—making the tax effects should be
exaggerated compared with what would be observed as the result of a per-

data in Table 7 are not easily explained by the life—cycle

model, however. First, the five year program appears to have a considerably greater effect on labor supply than does the 3 year program.
This suggests that income effects must be an important component of the

labor supply response. On the other hand, labor supply effects after
completion of both programs are essentially negligible, which suggests
that these income effects have not been distributed smoothly over the
life—cycle in accord with the predictions of the model.
Another disturbing feature of the results in panel B of Table 7 con-

cerns the apparent tax effects in the data. This panel shows three two

way contrass (at different guarantee levels1 which is the income
received at zero work hours) of 70 versus 50 percent tax rate programs.
In every case the decline in work effort is smaller under the higher

tax rate program. This also suggests that income effects are playing a
far more important role in these data than would be consistent with a
major role for interteaporal substitution.
Surprisingly, research to date has only scratched the surface of

what is possible with the experimental data available. A careful analysis of these data for the purpose of exploring and testing the detailed
predictions of the life—cycle model of labor supply is long overdue.

III. Conclusion
In my view the microeconomic empirical work based on the
life—cycle model of labor supply represents one of the finest amalgams
of careful data analysis and applied theoretical work that exists in

modern economics. It seems clear, however, that these analyses of
intertemporal labor supply have not yet produced a coherent empirical
explanation of the aggregate movements in hours of work in the available

panel data. A simple way to see this is to first examine the time—
series movements in the average hours at work in column 2 of Table 6
(for the PSID). The basic idea of the intertecuporal labor supply model
is to explain these changes as movements along a fixed supply curve.

There are three problems in doing this. First, average hours and the
average real wage must move in the same direction, which, as the table
indicates, occurs most, but riot all of the time. Second, as column 4

—29—

indicates, he slope of the labor supply function must fluctuate considerably from year to year in order to square up the aggregate hours

and wage rate changes. Finally, the average labor supply elasticity
must apparently be quite large to square up these hours and wage rate
movements, while the available estimates of its slope that I have sur-

veyed are, in fact, very small. The basic empirical problem seems to be
that within the life—cycle, the person—specific correlation between
hours and wages is simply too small to explain the time—series movements
in average hours relative to the time—series movements in average wage

rates. The intertemporal substitution hypothesis originally advanced by
Lucas and Rapping was, of course, precisely the suspicion that this was
not the case.

It remains to consider what light these findings shed on the more
familiar data that register movements in the business cycle and to which
nacroeconoinists are accustomed. Apparently the connection is not very

straightforward, as the last tw columns of Table 6 indicate. The fifth
column of this table contains the annual first difference of the male

unemployment proportion for workers aged 35—44. This is an often used
cyclical indicator and it moves in tune with the unemployment rates for

most other groups. A comparison of the PSID hours changes in column 2
of the table with these unemployment changes (they are in a similar
scale). indicates that these series are by no means identical. To be
sure, both series indicate similar magnitudes for the 1974—75 recession,
but they move very differently in the three preceding years and in the

—30—

last year o the sample. The last column of Table 6 shows that acorn—
parison of the P519 average hours data with an index of aggregate

manhours from the BLS payroll data fares no better. These latter data
are no doubt heavily influenced by demographic and other trends, but it
is by no means clear that any simple detrending will reconcile them with

the PSID data. It appears that a careful reconciliation of the basic
microeconornic and macroeconomic data is going to be necessary before

further conclusions are warranted. Such a research project deserves
high priority for future research.

In tracing through the status of the empirical research on
microeconomic models of life—cycle (or intertemporal) labor supply, it
is difficult to come away with the impression that these simple imple—

mentable models are providing good descriptions of the available longi-

tudinal data)7 In this regard it seems that the macroeconomic and
microeconomic models of labor supply share much in common. Of course,
it is always possible to attribute the empirical difficulties of both
types of models to measurement error or flaws in functional forms.
It is even possible that the measurement error in the microeconomic
data is so severe that there is little or nothing to be gained from any

analysis of it. Likewise, it may he that the restriction to linear
functional forms is too restrictive, although it is hard to imagine

17Others have come (independently, I should add) to similar conclusions.
Pencavel (1984, p. 147) writes, after a survey of the intertemporal
labor supply research: '...the greater part of the variations in male
labor supply across workers and over time is left unexplained by this
research. A great deal of effort has been brought to bear on what
appear to be relationships of second—order of importance."

—31—
that the ki?d of data currently available could credibly support
anything more elaborate.

It Is important to emphasize that the empirical difficulties in
estimating intertemporal labor supply elasticities are not a problem

primarily at the macroeconomic level. If there is something missing
from these models of labor supply it is apparently missing both from
the inicroeconomic and the macroeconomic models. What night it be?
In my view it must surely be the case that the long run behavior of
average hours at work are mainly a result of worker preferences as

between the consumption of goods and leisure. At the same time, it
seems reasonable to suppose that demand induced movements in hours

worked, at predetermined wage rates, may likewise have a role to play in

the short run interplay of hours and earnings determination.'8 It
should be emphasized that the existence of such demand related hours
shocks has no particular normative implication for any public policies.

Moreover, demand shocks as an explanation for employment fluctuations
date at least to Adam Smith, who wrote:

the wages of labour in different occupations vary with the

constancy or inconstancy of employment. Employment is much more
constant in some trades than in others. In the greater part of
manufactures, a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment

18The empirical implications of the supply side of such a model have
been worked out in Abowd and Ashenfelter (1979, 1981), but the empirical models estimated in those papers are not notably successful.

almost every day in the year that he is able to work. A mason
or bricklayer, on the. contrary, can work neither in hard frost

nor in foul weather, and his employment at all other times depends

on the occasional calls of his customers. Be is liable, in consequence, to be without any. %Qhat he earns, therefore, while he is
employed, must not only maintain hint while he is idle, but make

him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments
which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes
occasion.

It seems clear that Smith did not expect the wage rates of masons to
fluctuate with hard frost or the occasional calls of their customers,

and that he did not expect to explain employment fluctuations as a
response to such wage rate fluctuations. Constructing a testable model
that might reconcile the long run determination of hours worked by
worker preferences with the short run interaction of observed
employment and earnings may be the missing ingredient in both the
macroeconomic and microeconomic models of labor supply.
