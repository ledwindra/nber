    "abstract": "\n\nWe study the effects of debt-financed fiscal transfers in a general equilibrium, heterogeneous-agent model of the world economy. In the long run, increases in government debt anywhere raise the world interest rate and increase private wealth everywhere. In the short run, a country with a larger-than-average fiscal deficit experiences both a large increase in private savings (\u201cexcess savings\u201d) and a small but persistent current account deficit (a slow-motion \u201ctwin deficit\u201d). These patterns are consistent with the evolution of the world\u2019s balance of payments since the beginning of the Covid pandemic.\n\n",
