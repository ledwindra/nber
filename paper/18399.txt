ABSTRACT
We propose a novel method to estimate dynamic equilibrium models with stochastic volatility. First,
we characterize the properties of the solution to this class of models. Second, we take advantage of
the results about the structure of the solution to build a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to evaluate
the likelihood function of the model. The approach, which exploits the profusion of shocks in stochastic
volatility models, is versatile and computationally tractable even in large-scale models, such as those
often employed by policy-making institutions. As an application, we use our algorithm and Bayesian
methods to estimate a business cycle model of the U.S. economy with both stochastic volatility and
parameter drifting in monetary policy. Our application shows the importance of stochastic volatility
in accounting for the dynamics of the data.

1. Introduction
Over the last few years, economists have uncovered the importance of time-varying volatility in
accounting for the dynamics of U.S. aggregate data. Stock and Watson (2002) and Sims and
Zha (2006) are some prominent examples of this line of research. As a response, a growing
literature has developed to investigate the origins and consequences of time-varying volatility. A
particularly successful branch of this literature uses dynamic equilibrium models to emphasize the
role of volatility shocks (also known as uncertainty shocks, but in any case speci…ed as stochastic
volatility as in Shephard, 2008) in business cycle ‡uctuations. Among those we can highlight are
Bloom et al. (2007), Fernández-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramírez (2007), Justiniano and Primiceri
(2008), Bloom (2009), Fernández-Villaverde et al. (2010c), and Bloom et al. (2012). In these
models, there are two types of shocks: structural shocks (shock to productivity, to preferences,
to policy, etc.) and volatility shocks (shocks to the standard deviation of the innovations to the
structural shocks).
To ful…ll the promise in this literature, it is crucial to have a set of tools to take these dynamic
equilibrium models with stochastic volatility to the data. Namely, we want to estimate, evaluate,
and compare these models using a likelihood-based approach. However, the task is complicated
by the inherent non-linearity that stochastic volatility generates. By construction, linearization is
ill-equipped to handle time-varying volatility models because it yields certainty-equivalent policy
functions. That is, volatility in‡uences neither the agents’decision rules nor the laws of motion
of the aggregate variables. Hence, to consider how volatility a¤ects those, it becomes imperative
to employ a non-linear solution method for the dynamics of the economy. Once we consider
non-linear solution methods we are forced to use simulation-based estimators of the likelihood.
In principle, and beyond the computational burden, this could seem a mild challenge. For
instance, one could be tempted to get around this problem by solving the model non-linearly with
a fast algorithm and employing, for estimation, a particle …lter to get an unbiased simulationbased estimator of the likelihood. The particle …lter presented in Fernández-Villaverde and RubioRamírez (2007) would be a natural candidate for such an undertaking. Unfortunately, that version
of the particle …lter relies, when estimating models with stochastic volatility, on the presence of linear measurement errors in observables. Otherwise, we would be forced to solve a large quadratic
system of equations with multiple solutions, an endeavor for which there are no suitable algorithms. Although measurement errors are both plausible and empirically relevant, their presence
3

complicates the interpretation of the results. Thus, it is desirable to consider a particle …lter that
departs from requiring measurement errors.
To accomplish this goal, we show how to write a particle …lter that allows us to evaluate
the likelihood of a dynamic equilibrium model with stochastic volatility by exploiting the structure of the second-order approximation to the decision rules that characterize the equilibrium
of the economy without the need of measurement errors. Second-order approximations capture
the implications of stochastic volatility and are convenient because they are accurate but not
computationally expensive.
We achieve the objective in two steps. First, we characterize the second-order approximation
to the decision rules of a rather general dynamic equilibrium model with stochastic volatility.1
Second, we demonstrate how we can use this characterization to handily simulate the likelihood
function of the model with a particle …lter without measurement errors. The key is to show how
the decision rules characterization reduces the quadratic problem associated with the evaluation
of the approximated measurement density to a much simpler matrix inversion problem. This is a
novel extension of sequential Monte Carlo methods that can be useful for other applications. After
we have evaluated the likelihood, we can combine it with a prior and an Markov chain Monte
Carlo (McMc) algorithm to draw from the posterior distribution (Flury and Shephard, 2011).
Our characterization of the second-order approximation to the decision rules should be of
interest in itself even for researchers who are not evaluating the likelihood of their model but who
are keen to understand how the model works. Among others, the results are useful to analyze the
equilibrium of the model, to explore the shape of its impulse-response functions, or to calibrate
it.
More concretely, we prove that:
1. The …rst-order approximation to the decision rules of the agents (or any other equilibrium
object of interest) does not depend on volatility shocks and they are certainty equivalent.
2. The second-order approximation to the decision rules of the agents only depends on volatility
shocks on terms where volatility is multiplied by the innovation to its own structural shock.
For instance, if we have two structural shocks (a productivity and a preference shock) and
1

These theorems generalize previous results derived by Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004), for the homoscedastic
shocks case to the time-varying case.

4

a volatility shock to each of them, the only non-zero term where the volatility shock to
productivity appears is the one where the volatility shock to productivity multiplies the
innovation to the productivity shock. Thus, of the terms in the second-order approximation
that complicate the evaluation of the likelihood function, only a few are non-zero.
3. The perturbation parameter will only appear in a non-zero term where it is raised to a
square. This term is a constant that corrects for precautionary behavior induced by risk.
As an application, we estimate a dynamic equilibrium model of the U.S. economy with stochastic volatility using the particle …lter and Bayesian methods. The model, an otherwise standard
business cycle model with nominal rigidities, incorporates not only stochastic volatility in the
shocks that drive its dynamics but also parameter drifting in the parameters that control monetary policy. In that way, we include two of the main mechanisms that researchers have highlighted
to account for the time-varying volatility of U.S. data: heteroscedastic shocks and parameter drifting. We include these together in the model because a “one-at-a-time” investigation is fraught
with peril. If we allow only one source of variation in the model, the likelihood may want to take
advantage of this extra degree of ‡exibility to …t the data better. For example, if the “true”model
is one with parameter drifting in monetary policy, an estimated model without drift but with stochastic volatility in one of the structural shocks may interpret the “true” drift as time-varying
volatility in that shock. If, instead, we had time-varying volatility in technological shocks in the
data, an estimated model without stochastic volatility and only parameter drifting may conclude,
erroneously, that the parameters of monetary policy are changing. Lastly, we have a model that
is as rich as the models employed by policy-making institutions in real life. While solving and
estimating such a large model is a computational challenge, we wanted to demonstrate that our
procedure is of practical use and to make our application a blueprint for the estimation of other
dynamic equilibrium models.
Our main empirical …ndings are as follows. First, the posterior distribution of parameters
puts most of its mass in areas that denote a fair amount of stochastic volatility, yet another
proof of the importance of time-varying volatility in applied models. Second, a model comparison
exercise indicates that, even after controlling for stochastic volatility, the data clearly prefer a
speci…cation where monetary policy changes over time. This …nding should not be interpreted,
though, as implying that volatility shocks did not play a role of their own. It means, instead,

5

that a successful model of the U.S. economy requires the presence of both stochastic volatility
and parameter drifting, a result that challenges the results of Sims and Zha (2006). Finally, we
document the evolution of the structural shocks, of stochastic volatility, and the parameters of
monetary policy. We emphasize the con‡uence, during the 1970s, of times of high volatility and
weak responses to in‡ation, and, during the 1990s, of positive structural shocks and low volatility
even if monetary policy was weaker than often argued. In the appendix, we thoroughly explore
the model, including the construction of counterfactual histories of the U.S. data by varying
some aspect of the model such as shutting down time-varying volatility or imposing alternative
monetary policies.
An alternative to our stochastic volatility framework would be to work with Markov regimeswitching models such as those of Bianchi (2009) or Farmer et al. (2009). This class of models
provides an extra degree of ‡exibility in modelling aggregate dynamics that is highly promising.
In fact, some of the fast changes in policy parameters that we document in our empirical section suggest that discrete jumps could be a good representation of the data. However, current
technical limitations regarding the computation of the equilibria induced by regime switches force
researchers to focus on small models that are only stylized representations of an economy.
Finally, even if the motivation for our approach and the application belong to macroeconomics,
there is nothing speci…c about that …eld in the tools we present. One can think about the importance of estimating dynamic equilibrium models with stochastic volatility in many other …elds,
from …nance (Bansal and Yaron, 2004, would be a prominent example) to industrial organization
(for instance, an equilibrium model of industry dynamics where the demand and supply shocks
have time-varying volatility), international trade (where innovations to the real exchange rates or
to the country spreads are well known to have time-varying volatility, see Fernández-Villaverde et
al., 2010c), or many others.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a generic dynamic equilibrium
model with stochastic volatility to …x notation and discuss how to solve it. Section 3 explains
the evaluation of the likelihood of the model. Section 4 introduces a business cycle model as
an application of our procedure, takes it to the U.S. data, and comments on the main …ndings.
Section 5 concludes. An extensive technical appendix includes details about the proofs of the
main results in the paper, the model, the computation, and additional empirical exercises.

2. Dynamic Equilibrium Models with Stochastic Volatility
2.1. The Model
The set of equilibrium conditions of a wide class of dynamic equilibrium models can be written as
Et f (Yt+1 ; Yt ; St+1 ; St ; Zt+1 ; Zt ; ) = 0;

(1)

where Et is the conditional expectation operator at time t, Yt = (Y1t ; Y2t ; : : : ; Ykt )0 is the k

vector of observables at time t, St = (S1t ; S2t ; : : : ; Snt )0 is the n

at time t, Zt = (Z1t ; Z2t ; : : : ; Zmt )0 is the m
R2(k+n+m) into Rk+n+m , and

is the n

technology. In the context of this paper,

1

1 vector of endogenous states

1 vector of structural shocks at time t, f maps

1 vector of parameters that describe preferences and
is also the vector of parameters to be estimated.

We will consider models where the structural shocks, Zit+1 , follow a stochastic volatility process
of the form
Zit+1 =
for all i 2 f1; : : : ; mg, where

i Zit

(2)

i it+1 "it+1

is a perturbation parameter,

i

is the mean volatility, and log

It

will be clear momentarily why we specify (2) and (3) in terms of the perturbation parameter

.

We multiply the innovation in (3) by 1

to normalize its size by the persistence of

it+1 .

It is also convenient to write, for all i 2 f1; : : : ; mg, the laws of motions for Zit and log
Zit =

appears only in equations (2) and (3) but not in

equations (4) and (5). This is because this parameter is used to eliminate, when we later determine
the point around which to perform a higher-order approximation to the equilibrium dynamics of
the model, any uncertainty about the future. Given the information set in equation (1), there
is uncertainty about both Zit+1 and log
about either Zit or log

m

1 vector of

innovations to the volatility shocks. We assume that Et s N (0; I) and Ut s N (0; I), where 0 is
an m

1 vector of zeros and I is an m

m identity matrix. To ease notation, we assume that:

1. All structural shocks face volatility shocks and that the volatility shocks are uncorrelated.
It is straightforward, yet cumbersome, to generalize the notation to other cases.
2. Et and Ut are normally distributed. As we will see below, to implement our particle …lter,
we only need to be able to simulate Et and evaluate the density of Ut .
2.2. The Solution
Given equations (1)-(5), the solution to the model -if one exists- that embodies equilibrium dynamics (that is, agent’s optimization and market clearing conditions) is characterized by a policy
function describing the evolution of the endogenous state variables
St+1 = h (St ; Zt 1 ;

t 1 ; Et ; Ut ;

; );

(6)

and two policy functions describing the law of motion of the observables
Yt = g (St ; Zt 1 ;

t 1 ; Et ; Ut ;

; )

(7)

and
Yt+1 = g (St+1 ; Zt ;

t;

Et+1 ; Ut+1 ; ; ) ;

(8)

together with equations (4) and (5) describing the laws of motion of the structural and volatility
shocks. The policy functions h and g map Rn+4m+1 into Rn and Rk ; respectively, and are indexed
by the vector of parameters .

8

For our purposes, it is important to de…ne the steady state of the model. Our assumptions
about the stochastic processes imply that, in the steady state, Z = 0 and
of parameters

= 0. Given a vector

and equations (1)-(8), the steady state of the model is a k 1 vector of observables

Y = (Y1 ; Y2 ; : : : ; Yk )0 and an n

1 vector of endogenous states S = (S1 ; S2 ; : : : ; Sn )0 such that

f (g (h (S; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; ) ; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; ) ; g (S; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; ) ; h (S; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; ) ; S; 0; 0; ) = 0:
(9)
In addition, in the steady state, the following two relationships hold
S = h (S; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; ) ;

(10)

Y = g (S; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; ) :

(11)

and

The perturbation parameter

plays a key role in de…ning our steady state. If

= 0; the

model is in the steady state, since we eliminate any uncertainty about the future. If

6= 0; the

model is not in the steady state and conditions (9)-(11) do not hold. For instance, in general
S 6= h (S; 0; 0; 0; 0; ; ) because of the precautionary behavior of agents.
2.3. The State-Space Representation
Given the solution to the model -the policy functions (6)-(8) together with equations (4) and (5)we can concisely characterize the equilibrium dynamics of the model by its state-space representation written in terms of the transition and the observation equations.
The transition equation uses the policy function (6), together with equations (4) and (5),
to describe the evolution of the states (endogenous states, structural shocks, volatility shocks,
and their innovations) as a function of lag states, the perturbation parameter, and the vector of
parameters

where St = St0 ; Zt0 1 ;

0

0 0
t 1 ; Et ; Ut

St+1 = e
h (St ; ; ) + Wt+1

(12)

is the (n + 4m) 1 vector of the states and e
h maps Rn+4m+1 into
0

0
0
Rn+4m . Also, Wt+1 = W1t+1
; W2t+1
is a 2m 1 vector of random variables, W1t+1 and W2t+1 are

m 1 vectors with distributions W1t+1 s N (0; I) and W2t+1 s N (0; I), and
matrix with the the top n + 2m rows equal to zero and the bottom 2m
9

is a (n + 4m) 2m

2m matrix equal to the

identity matrix. Note that W1t+1 and W2t+1 share distributions with Et+1 and Ut+1 respectively.
If we were to change distributions for either Et+1 or Ut+1 we would need to do the same with W1t+1
and W2t+1 . Let us de…ne ns = n + 4m. The linearity of the second term of the right-hand side
is a consequence of the autoregressive speci…cation of the structural shocks and the evolution of
their volatilities. However, through the function e
h, we let those shocks and their volatilities a¤ect
St+1 nonlinearly.

The measurement equation uses the policy function (7) to describe the relationship of the
observables with the states, the perturbation parameter, and the vector of parameters
Yt = g (St ; ; ) :

(13)

2.4. Approximating the State-Space Representation
In general, when we deal with the class of dynamic equilibrium models with stochastic volatility,
we do not have access to a closed-form solution, that is, the policy functions h and g cannot be
found explicitly. Thus, we cannot build the state-space representation described by (12) and (13).
Instead, we will approximate numerically the solution of model and use the result to generate an
approximated state-space representation.
There are many di¤erent solution algorithms for dynamic equilibrium models. Among those,
the perturbation method has emerged as a popular way (see Judd and Guu, 1997, Schmitt-Grohé
and Uribe, 2004, and Aruoba et al., 2006 among others) to obtain higher-order Taylor series
approximations to the policy functions (6)-(7) together with equations (4) and (5) around the
steady state. It is key to note that we also get the Taylor expansion of (4) because it is a nonlinear function. Beyond being extremely fast for systems with a large number of state variables,
perturbation o¤ers high levels of accuracy even relatively far away from the perturbation point
(Aruoba, et al., 2006, and, for cases with stochastic volatility, Caldara et al., 2012).
The perturbation method allows the researcher to approximate the solution to the model up
to any order. Since we want to analyze models with volatility shocks, we must go beyond a
…rst-order approximation. First-order approximations are certainty equivalent and hence, they
are silent about stochastic volatility. As we well see in section 3.1, volatility shocks only appear
starting in the second-order approximation. But since we want to evaluate the likelihood function,
we need to stop at a second-order approximation. Because of dimensionality issues, higher-order

10

approximation would make the evaluation of the likelihood function exceedingly challenging for
current computers for models with a reasonable number of state variables.
Given a second-order approximation to the policy functions (6)-(7) together with equations (4)
and (5) around the steady state, the approximated state-space representation can be written in
terms of two equations: the approximated transition equation and the approximated measurement
equation. The approximated transition equation is

any measurement error. We will return to this point in a few paragraphs.

3. Stochastic Volatility and Evaluation of the Likelihood
In this section, we explain how to evaluate the likelihood function of our class of dynamic equilibrium models with volatility shocks in equation (1) using the approximated transition and the
measurement equations (14) and (15). If we allow Yt to be the data counterpart of our observables Yt , Yt = (Y1 ; : : : ; Yt ) (with Y0 = f?g) to be their history up to time t, given a vector of
parameters , we can write the likelihood of YT as
T

(17)

Note that the Ut ’s do not show up in these two expressions. It will be momentarily clear why this
comes directly from our procedure below to evaluate the likelihood.
Computing this likelihood is a di¢ cult problem. Since we do not have analytic forms for the
terms inside the integral, it cannot be evaluated exactly and deterministic numerical integration
algorithms are too slow for practical use (we have four integrals per period over large dimensions).
As a feasible alternative, we will show how to use a simple particle …lter to obtain a simulationbased estimate of (16) for the class of dynamic equilibrium models with volatility shocks we
described above. Künsch (2005) proves, under weak conditions, that the particle …lter delivers a
consistent estimator of the likelihood function and that a central limit theorem applies. A particle
…lter is a sequential simulation device for …ltering of nonlinear and/or non-Gaussian space models
(Pitt and Shephard, 1999, and Doucet et al., 2001). In economics the particle …lter has been used,
among others, by Fernández-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramírez (2007).
12

As mentioned before, the particle …lter has minimal requirements: the ability to evaluate the
approximated measurement density associated with the approximated measurement equation, to
simulate from the approximated dynamics of the state using the approximated transition equation,
and to draw from the unconditional density of the states implied by the approximated transition
equation. Usually, the …rst requirement is the hardest. These three requirements are formally
described in the following assumption.
Assumption 1. To implement the particle …lter, we assume that:
1. We can evaluate the approximated measurement density
p (Yt = Yt jSt ; Zt 1 ;

t 1 ; Et ;

):

2. We can simulate from the approximated transition equation

for all t 2 f1; : : : ; T g, where F (Yt ) is the …ltration of Yt .
3. We can draw from the unconditional distribution implied by the approximated transition
equation
p (St ; Zt 1 ;

t 1 ; Et ;

):

The second requirement asks for the …ltration of Yt , F (Yt ), because we will need to evaluate
the volatility shocks (this will be clearer below). The last requirement can be easily implemented
using the results in Santos and Peralta-Alva (2005). Given our assumption about Et+1 and the
quadratic form of the approximated transition equation (14), the second requirement easily holds.
A key novelty of this paper is that we show how the class of dynamic equilibrium models with
volatility shocks considered here also satis…es the …rst requirement.

Solving this system is non-trivial. Since the system is quadratic, we may have either none or
several di¤erent solutions. In fact, it is even hard to know how many solutions there are. But
even if we knew the number of solutions, we are not aware of any accurate and e¢ cient method to
solve quadratic problems that …nds all the solutions. This di¢ culty seemingly prevents us from
achieving our goal of evaluating the likelihood function.
A solution would be to introduce, as Fernández-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramírez (2007) did, a
k

1 vector of linear measurement errors and solve for those instead of Ut . In this case the system

would have a unique, easy to …nd solution. However, there are three reasons, in increasing order
of importance, why this solution is not satisfactory:
1. Although measurement errors are both plausible and empirically relevant, their presence
complicates the interpretation of any empirical results. In particular, we are interested
in measuring how heteroscedastic structural shocks help in accounting for the data and
measurement errors can confound us.
2. The absence of measurement errors will help us to illustrate below how dynamic equilibrium
models with volatility shocks have a profusion of shocks that we can exploit in our estimation.
3. As we will also show below, volatility shocks would enter linearly (conditional on the draw)
in the system equations. Since, by de…nition, linear measurement errors would also enter in
the same fashion, it would be hard to identify one apart from the others.
Our alternative in this paper is to realize that considering stochastic volatility converts the
above-described quadratic system into a linear one. Hence, if a rank condition is satis…ed, the
system (22) has only one solution and the solution can be found by simply inverting a matrix.
Thus, requirement 1 in assumption 1 holds and we can use the particle …lter. The core of the
argument is to note that, when volatility shocks are considered, the policy functions share a
peculiar pattern that we can exploit.
3.1. Structure of the Solution
Our …rst step will characterize the …rst- and second-order derivatives of the policy functions
h and g evaluated at the steady state. Then, we will describe an interesting pattern in these
derivatives. The second step will take advantage of the pattern to show that, when the number
15

of volatility shocks equals the number of observables, our quadratic system becomes a linear one.
This characterization is important both for estimation and, more generally, for the analysis of
perturbation solutions to dynamic equilibrium models with stochastic volatility.
3.1.1. First- and Second-order Derivatives of the Policy Functions
Let us begin with the characterization of the …rst- and second-order derivatives of the policy
functions. The following theorem shows that the …rst-order derivatives of h and g with respect to
any component of Ut and

t 1

evaluated at the steady state are zero; that is, volatility shocks and

their innovations do not a¤ect the linear component of the optimal decision rule of the agents.
The same occurs with the perturbation parameter

. A similar result has been established by

Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004) for the homoscedastic shocks case.

Theorem 2. Let us denote [
with respect to the j

as the derivative of the i

th element of generic function

state (where we drop this index if ! is unidimensional). Then, for the dynamic equilibrium model

Proof. See appendix 6.1.1.
The second theorem shows, among other things, that the second partial derivatives of h and g
with respect to either log

it

or ui;t and any other variable but "i;t is also zero for any i 2 f1; : : : ; mg.

Proof. See appendix 6.1.2.
Since the statement of theorem 3 is long and involved, we clarify it with a table in which we
characterize the second derivatives of the functions h and g with respect to the di¤erent variables
(St ; Zt 1 ;

t 1 ; Et ; Ut ;

). This pattern is both interesting and useful for our purposes.

The way to read table 3.1 is as follows. Take an arbitrary entry, for instance, entry (1,2),
St Zt
Zt

1

1

6= 0. In this entry, we state that the cross-derivatives of h and g with respect to St and

are di¤erent from zero (the table is upper triangular because, given the symmetry of second

derivatives, we do not need to report those entries). Similarly, entry (3,5),
the cross-derivatives of h and g with respect to

t 1

t 1 Ut

= 0 tells us that

and Ut are all zero.2 Entries (3,4) and (4,5)

2
For ease of exposition, in table 3.1 we are not being explicit about the dimensions of the matrices: it is a purely
qualititive description of the relevant derivatives.

17

have a “*” to denote that the only cross-derivatives of those entries that are di¤erent from zero
are those that correspond to the same index j (that is, the cross-derivatives of each innovation
to the structural shocks with respect to its own volatility shock and the cross-derivatives of the
innovation to the structural shocks to the innovation to its own volatility shock). The lower
triangular part of the table is empty because of the symmetry of second derivatives.
Table 3.1 tells us that, of the 21 possible sets of second derivatives, 12 are zero and 9 are not.
The implications for the decision rules of agents and for the equilibrium function are striking.
The perturbation parameter, , will only have a coe¢ cient di¤erent from zero in the term where
it appears in a square by itself. This term is a constant that corrects for precautionary behavior
induced by risk. Volatility shocks,
term

t 1 Et

t 1

, appear with coe¢ cients di¤erent from zero only in the

where they are multiplied by the innovation to its own structural shock Et . Finally,

innovations to the volatility shocks, Ut , also appear with coe¢ cients di¤erent from zero when they
show up with the innovation to their own structural shock Et . Hence, of the terms that complicate
the evaluation of the approximated measurement density, only the ones associated with [hEt ;Ut ]ij11 ;j1
and [gEt ;Ut ]ij21 ;j1 are non-zero.
3.1.2. Evaluating the Likelihood Using the Particle Filter
The second step is to use theorems 2 and 3 to show that the system (22) is linear and it has only
one solution. Corollary 4 shows that the pattern described in table 3.1. has an important, yet
rather direct implication for the structure of the approximated measurement equation (21).

19

Theorem 5 shows that requirement 1 in assumption 1 holds. Consequently, we can use a
variation of the particle …lter adapted for our class of dynamic equilibrium models with volatility
shocks. We are requiring B ("it ; ) to be full rank. When can B ("it ; ) not be full rank? B ("it ; )
would fail to have full rank when the impact of volatility innovations are identical across several
elements of Yt . This would mean that the observables lack enough information to tell volatility
shocks apart. If this is the case, a new set of observables would have to be chosen to estimate the
model.
Note also that theorem 5 assumes k = m. Given the notation in section 2.1, this means
that the number of structural shocks equals to the number of observables. This is not always
necessary. What the theorem needs is that the number of volatility shocks equals the number of
observables. Since, to simplify notation, we have assumed that all structural shocks face volatility
shocks, the number of structural shocks equals the number of observables. As mentioned in section
2.1, we could have structural shocks that do not face volatility shocks (this will be the case in
our application to follow). In that case, we could have more structural shocks than observables.
From the theorem, it is also clear that if we used Et rather than Ut to compute the approximated
measurement equation, we would have to solve a quadratic system, a challenging task.
An outline of the algorithm in pseudo-code is:

Once we have evaluated the likelihood, we can nest this algorithm either with a McMc to
perform Bayesian inference (as done in our application; see Flury and Shephard, 2011, for technical
details) or with some optimization algorithm to undertake maximum likelihood estimation (as
done, in a model without volatility shocks, by Van Binsbergen et al., 2012). In this last case, care
must be taken to keep the random numbers used in the particle …lter constant among iterations
to achieve equi-continuity and to use an optimization algorithm that does not rely on derivatives,
as the particle …lter implies an evaluation of the likelihood function that is not di¤erentiable.

4. An Application: A Business Cycle Model with Stochastic Volatility
As an illustration of our procedure, we estimate a business cycle model of the U.S. economy with
nominal rigidities and stochastic volatility. We will show: 1) how we can characterize posterior
distributions of the parameters of interest and 2) how we can recover and analyze the smoothed
structural and volatility shocks. Those are two of the most relevant exercises in terms of the
estimation of dynamic equilibrium models. Once the estimation has been undertaken, there are
many other exercises that can be done with the empirical results. For instance, in the appendix,
we include several of those such as: 1) …nding the impulse response functions (IRFs) of the model;
2) evaluating the …t of the model in comparison with some alternatives; and 3) undertaking some
counterfactuals and run alternative histories of the evolution of the U.S. economy.
Before doing so, though, we need to motivate our choice of application. The model that we
present has many strengths but also important weaknesses. Su¢ ce it to say here that since this
model is the base of much applied policy analysis by academics and policy-making institutions, it
is a natural example for this paper. Thus, given that the model is well known, our presentation
will be brief. We will depart only along two dimensions from the standard model: we will have
stochastic volatility in the shocks that drive the dynamics of the economy (the object of interest
in this paper) and parameter drifting in the monetary policy rule. In that way, the likelihood
21

has the chance of picking between two of the alternatives that the literature has highlighted to
account for the well-documented time-varying volatility of the U.S. aggregate time series, either
a reduced volatility of the shocks that hit the economy (as in Sims and Zha, 2006) or a di¤erent
monetary policy (Clarida et al., 2000), which makes the application of interest in itself.
4.1. Households
The economy is populated by a continuum of households indexed by j and preferences:

E0

X

t

t=0

dt

(

log (cjt

mjt
pt

hcjt 1 ) + log

1+#
ljt
1+#

't

)

;

which are separable in consumption, cjt , real money balances, mjt =pt ; and hours worked, ljt . In
our notation, E0 is the conditional expectations operator,

is the discount factor, h controls habit

persistence, # is the inverse of the Frisch labor supply elasticity, dt is a shifter to intertemporal
preference that follows log dt =

log dt

d

d dt "dt

where "dt

' 't "'t

N (0; 1); and 't is a labor supply

where "'t

N (0; 1): The two preference

shocks are common to all households.
The principal novelty of these preferences is that, for both shifters dt and 't , the standard
deviations,

dt

and

't ,

of their innovations, "dt and "'t , are indexed by time; that is, they

stochastically move according to:

This parsimonious speci…cation introduces only four new parameters,

N (0; 1):
d

,

'

,

d,

and

',

while

being surprisingly powerful in capturing important features of the data (Shephard, 2008). All the
shocks and innovations throughout the model are observed by the agents when they are realized.
Agents have, as well, rational expectations about how they evolve over time.
We can interpret the shocks to preferences and to their volatility as re‡ecting the random
evolution of more complicated phenomena. For example, stochastic volatility may appear as the
consequence of changing demographics. An economy with older agents might be both less patient
22

because of higher mortality risk (in our notation, a lower dt ) and less prone to reallocations in the
labor force because of longer attachments to particular jobs (in our notation, a lower

't ).

Although we assume complete …nancial markets, to ease notation we drop the Arrow securities
implied by that assumption from the budget constraints (they are in net zero supply at the
aggregate level anyway). Households also hold bjt government bonds that pay a nominal gross
interest rate of Rt 1 . Therefore, the j

4.4. Equilibrium and Solution
We can characterize the equilibrium of the model in appendix 6.2. This equilibrium conditions
are non-stationary because we have two unit roots in the processes for technology. However, we

; where the last two

zeros correspond to the processes for parameter drifting, which have constant volatilities (see
also in vector Ut below). Here, we can see that we do not need as many volatility shocks (5
of them) as structural shocks (7 of them).
4. The innovations to the structural and the volatility shocks are Et = ("dt ; "'t ; " t ; "At ; " t ; " t ; "yt )0
and Ut = (udt ; u't ; u t ; uAt ; u t )0 ; respectively.
We pick as observables the …rst di¤erence of the log of the relative price of investment, the log
federal funds rate, log in‡ation, the …rst di¤erence of log output, and the …rst di¤erence of log real
wages, in our notation Yt = ( 4 log

t ; log Rt ; log

0
t ; 4 log yt ; 4 log wt )

: We select these variables

because they bring us information about aggregate behavior (output), the stand of monetary policy
(the interest rate and in‡ation), and the di¤erent shocks (the relative price of investment about
investment-speci…c technological change, the other four variables about technology and preference
shocks) that we are concerned about. Note that we have the same number of observables as we
do of volatility shocks, as required by theorem 5.
We follow the steps in section 2.2 and employ a second-order perturbation around the rescaled
steady-state to approximate this equilibrium and build the associated state-space representation
(appendix 6.4 gives more details). The second-order approximation is even more relevant in our
application because, to complicate matters, a linearization would also imply that the parameter
drift in the Taylor rule would disappear as well from the equilibrium dynamics (see appendix 6.3).
4.5. Data and Estimation
We estimate our model using the …ve time series for the U.S. economy described above. Our
sample covers 1959.Q1 to 2007.Q1, with 192 observations. Because of space considerations, we
stop at 2007 to avoid having to deal with the recent …nancial crisis, which would make it di¢ cult
26

to appreciate the points we want to illustrate about how to econometrically deal with stochastic
volatility. This could be …xed at the cost of a lengthier discussion. Appendix 6.5 explains how we
construct the series.
Once we have evaluated the likelihood, we combine it with a prior. We pick ‡at priors on
a bounded support for all the parameters. The bounds are either natural economic restrictions
(for instance, the Calvo and indexation parameters lie between 0 and 1) or are so wide that
the likelihood assigns (numerically) zero probability to values outside them. Bounded ‡at priors
induce a proper posterior, a convenient feature for our exercises below.
We resort to ‡at priors for two reasons. First, to reduce the impact of presample information
and show that our results arise mainly from the shape of the likelihood and not from the prior
(although, of course, ‡at priors are not invariant to reparameterization). Thus, the reader who
wants to interpret our posterior modes as maximum likelihood point estimates can do so. Second, because as we learned in Fernández-Villaverde et al. (2010c), eliciting priors for stochastic
volatility is di¢ cult, since we deal with unfamiliar units, such as the variance of volatility shocks,
about which we do not have clear beliefs. Flat priors come, though, at a price: before proceeding
to the estimation, we have to …x several parameters to reduce the dimensionality of the problem.

Table 4.1 lists the …xed parameters. Our guiding criterion in selecting them was to pick conventional values in the literature. The discount factor,

= 0:99, is a default choice, habit persistence,

h = 0:9; matches the observed sluggish response of consumption to shocks, the parameter controlling the level of labor supply,
the depreciation rate,
substitution, " =

= 8; captures the average amount of hours in the data, and

= 0:025, induces the appropriate capital-output ratio. The elasticities of

= 10, deliver average mark-ups of around 10 percent, a common value in these

models. We set the cost of capital utilization,

2,

to a small number to introduce some curvature

in this decision. Three parameter values are borrowed from the point estimates from a similar
model without stochastic volatility or parameter drifting presented in Fernández-Villaverde et al.
(2009). The …rst is the inverse of the Frisch labor elasticity, # = 1:17. As argued by Chetty et
al. (2011), this aggregate elasticity is compatible with micro data, once we allow for intensive
and extensive margins on labor supply. The second is the coe¢ cient of the intermediate goods
27

production function,

= 0:21. This value is lower than the common calibration of Cobb-Douglas

production functions in real business cycle models because, in our environment, we have positive
pro…ts that appear as capital income in the National Income and Product Accounts. Finally,
the adjustment cost,

= 9:5, is in line with other estimates from similar models ( would be

particularly hard to identify, since investment is not one of our observables).
The autoregressive parameter of the evolution of the response to in‡ation,

, is set to 0.95.

In preliminary estimations, we discovered that the likelihood pushed this parameter to 1. When
this happened, the simulations became numerically unstable: after a series of positive innovations
to log

t,

the reaction of nominal interest rates to in‡ation could be too tepid for too long. The

0.95 value seems to be the highest possible value of

are equal to zero because, also in exploratory estimations,

0: Thus, we decided to forget about them and make

y

y;t

= 1:

To …nd the posterior, we proceed as follows. First, we de…ne a grid of parameter values and
check for the regions of high posterior density by evaluating the likelihood function in each point
of the grid. This is a time-consuming procedure, but it ensures that we are searching in the right
zone of the parameter space. Once we have identi…ed the global maximum in the grid, we initialize
a random-walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm from this point. After an extensive …ne-tuning of
the algorithm, we use 10,000 draws from the chain to compute posterior moments.
4.6. Results I: Parameter Estimates
Our …rst empirical result is the parameter estimates. To ease the discussion, we group them in
di¤erent tables, one for each set of parameters dealing with related aspects of the model. In all
cases, we report the mode of the posterior and the standard deviation in parenthesis below (in
the interest of space, we do not include the whole histograms of the posterior).

Table 4.2 presents the results for the nominal rigidities and the stochastic processes for the
structural shocks parameters. Our estimates indicate an economy with substantial rigidities in
prices, which are reoptimized roughly once every …ve quarters, and in wages, which are reoptimized
28

approximately every three quarters. Moreover, since the standard deviations are small, there is
enough information in the data about this result. At the same time, there is a fair amount of
indexation, between 0.62-0.63, which brings a strong persistence of in‡ation. While it is tempting
to compare our estimates with the micro evidence on the individual duration of prices, in our
model all prices and wages change every quarter. That is why, to a naive observer, our economy
would look like one displaying tremendous price ‡exibility.
We estimate a low persistence of the intertemporal preference shock and a high persistence of
the intratemporal one. The low estimate of

d

produces the quick variations in marginal utilities

of consumption that match output growth and in‡ation ‡uctuations. The intratemporal shock
is persistent to account for long-lived movements in hours worked. We estimate mean growth
rates of technology of 0.0034 (neutral) and 0.0028 (investment-speci…c). Those numbers give us
an average growth of the economy of 0.44 percent per quarter, or around 1.77 percent on an
annual basis (0.46 and 1.86 percent in the data, respectively). Technology shocks, in our model,
are deviations with respect to these drifts. Thus, we estimate that At falls in only 8 of the 192
quarters in our sample (which roughly corresponds to the percentage of quarters where measured
productivity falls in the data), even if we estimate negative innovations to neutral technology in
103 quarters.

The results for the parameters of the stochastic volatility processes appear in table 4.3. In
all cases, the ’s and the ’s are far away from zero: the likelihood strongly favors values where
stochastic volatility plays an important role. The standard deviations of the innovations of the
intertemporal preference shock and of the monetary policy shock are the most persistent, while the
standard deviation of the innovation of the intratemporal preference shock is the least persistent.

In table 4.4., we have the estimates of the policy parameters. The autoregressive component
of the federal funds rate is high, 0:7855, although somewhat smaller than in estimations without
parameter drift. The value of

y

(0.24 in levels) is similar to other results in the literature and

shows that the likelihood clearly likes parameter drifting, although with mild persistence. The
estimated value of

;t

(1.045

is temporarily below 1 (see

appendix 6.6 for details).
In appendix 6.7 we plot the impulse response functions of the model implied by our estimates.
This exercise allows us to check that the estimates are sensible and that the behavior of the model
is consistent with the behavior of related models in the literature. In appendix 6.8 we compare our
model against an alternative version without parameter drifting but still with stochastic volatility.
That is, we ask whether, once we have included stochastic volatility, it is still important to allow
for changes in the monetary policy rule to account for the time-varying volatility of U.S. aggregate
data over the last several decades. The results show that, even after controlling for stochastic
volatility, the data strongly prefer a speci…cation where the monetary policy rule has changed over
time. In appendix 6.9 we show, though, that this …nding does not imply that volatility shocks did
not play an important role in the time-varying volatilities of U.S. aggregate time series. In other
words, both stochastic volatility and parameter drifting are key parts of a successful dynamic
equilibrium model of the U.S. economy.

Also, these second-order e¤ects enormously complicate the introduction of time-variation in . The likelihood
wants to match the moments of the ergodic distribution of in‡ation, not the level of , which is in‡ation along
the balanced growth path. When we have non-linearities, the mean of that ergodic distribution may be far from
: Thus, learning about is hard. Learning about a time-varying is even harder.

Figure 4.1 reports the log-deviations with respect to their means for the smoothed intertemporal,
intratemporal, and monetary shocks and deviations of the growth rate of the investment and
technological shocks with respect to their means ( 2 standard deviations). To ease reading of the
results, we color di¤erent vertical bars to represent each of the periods at the Federal Reserve:
the McChesney Martin years from the start of our sample in 1959 to the appointment of Burns in
February 1970 (white), the Burns-Miller era (light blue), the Volcker interlude from August 1979

(log et ) shock, technology ( log A

t)

shock +/- 2 s.d.

We see in the top left panel of …gure 4.1 that the intertemporal shock, log dt ; is particularly high
in the 1970s. This increases households’desire for current consumption (for instance, because of
the entrance of baby boomers into adulthood). A higher aggregate demand triggers, in the model,
the higher in‡ation observed in the data for those years. The shock has a dramatic drop in the
second quarter of 1980. This is precisely the quarter in which the Carter administration invoked
the Credit Control Act (March 14, 1980). Schreft (1990) documents that this measure caused
31

turmoil in …nancial markets and, most likely, distorted intertemporal choices of households, which
is re‡ected in the large negative innovation to log dt . The low values of log dt in the 1990s with
respect to the 1970s and 1980s eased the in‡ationary pressures in the economy.
The shock to the utility of leisure, log 't , grows in the 1970s and falls in the 1980s to stabilize
at a very low value in the 1990s. The likelihood wants to track, in this way, the path of average
hours worked: low in the 1970s, increasing in the 1980s, and stabilizing in the 1990s. Higher hours
also lower the marginal cost of …rms (wages fall relative to the technology level). The reduction
in marginal costs also helped to reduce in‡ation during Greenspan’s tenure.
The evolution of the investment-speci…c technology, log et , shows a sharp drop after 1973 (when

it is likely that energy-intensive capital goods su¤ered the consequences of the oil shocks in the form
of economic obsolescence) and large positive realizations in the late 1990s (our model interprets

the sustained boom of those years as the consequence of strong improvements in investment
technology). These positive realizations were an additional help to contain in‡ation during the
et , have been stable since 1959, with
1990s. In comparison, the neutral-technology shocks, log A

only a few big shocks at the end of the sample.

The evolution of the monetary policy shock, log t , reveals large innovations in the early 1980s.
This is due both to the fast change in policy brought about by Volcker and to the fact that a Taylor
rule might not fully capture the dynamics of monetary policy during a period in which money
growth targeting was attempted. Sims and Zha (2006) also …nd that the Volcker period appears
to be one with large disturbances to the policy rule and argue that the Taylor rule formalism can
be a misleading perspective from which to view policy during that time. Our evidence from the
estimated intertemporal, intratemporal, and investment shocks suggests that monetary authorities
faced a more di¢ cult environment in the 1970s and early 1980s than in the 1990s.
As a way to gauge the level of uncertainty of our smoothed estimates, we also plot in …gure
4.1 the same shock ( 2 standard deviations). The lesson to take away from this …gure is that, in
all cases, the data are informative about the history we just narrated.

We move now, in …gure 4.2, to plot the evolution of the volatility shocks, all of them in logdeviations with respect to their estimated means (plus/minus two standard deviations). We see
in this …gure that the standard deviation of the intertemporal shock was particularly high in the
1970s and only slowly went down during the 1980s and early 1990s. By the end of the sample,
the standard deviation of the intertemporal shock was roughly at the level where it started. In
comparison, the standard deviation of all the other shocks is relatively stable except, perhaps,
for a large drop in the standard deviation of the monetary policy shock in the early 1980s as
well as large changes in the standard deviation of the investment shock during the period of oil
price shocks. Hence, the 1970s and the 1980s were more volatile than the 1960s and the 1990s,
creating a tougher environment for monetary policy. This result also con…rms Blanchard and
Simon’s (2001) and Nason and Smith’s (2008) observation that volatility had a downward trend
in the 20th century with an abrupt and temporal increase in the 1970s. Also, from the size of the
plus/minus two standard deviations, we conclude that the big movements in the di¤erent series
that we report can be ascertained with a reasonable degree of con…dence.

Finally, in …gure 4.3, we plot the evolution of the response of monetary policy to in‡ation
plus/minus a two-standard-deviation interval. In particular, we graph

t.

This graph shows

us an intriguing narrative. The parameter started the sample around its estimated mean, slightly
over 1, and it grew more or less steadily during the 1960s until reaching a peak in early 1968.
After that year, it su¤ered a fast collapse that took it below 1 in 1971. To put this evolution
in perspective, it is useful to remember that Burns was appointed chairman in February 1970.
The parameter stayed below 1 for all of the 1970s. The arrival of Volcker is quickly picked up by
our smoothed estimates: it increases to over 2 after a few months and stays high during all the
years of Volcker’s tenure. Interestingly, our estimate captures well the observation by Goodfriend
and King (2007) that monetary policy tightened in the spring of 1980 as in‡ation and long-run
in‡ation expectations continued to grow. Its level stayed roughly constant at this high during
the remainder of Volcker’s tenure. But as quickly as it rose when Volcker arrived, it went down
again when he departed. Greenspan’s tenure at the Fed meant that, by 1990, the response of the
monetary authority to in‡ation was again below 1. Moreover, our estimates are relatively tight.
Fernández-Villaverde et al. (2010a) discuss how the results of the estimation relate to historical
evidence.

5. Conclusion
In this paper, we have shown how to estimate dynamic equilibrium models with stochastic volatility. The key of the procedure is to realize that a second-order perturbation to the solution of this
class of models has a very particular structure that can be easily exploited to build an e¢ cient
particle …lter. The recent boom in the literature on dynamic equilibrium models with stochastic
volatility suggests that this procedure may have many uses. Our characterization of the solution
might also be, on many occasions, of interest in itself to understand the dynamic properties of
the equilibrium even if the researcher does not want to estimate the model.
As an application to illustrate how the procedure works we have estimated a business cycle
model with both stochastic volatility in the structural shocks that drive the economy and parameter drifting in the monetary policy rule. Such a model is motivated by the need to have an
empirical framework where we can account for the time-varying volatility of U.S. aggregate time
series. In particular, we have explained how you get point estimates in such a model and how
to recover and analyze the smoothed structural and volatility shocks. Finally, through di¤erent
comments -even if brief and not exhaustive- we have discussed the di¤erent empirical lessons that
one can get from all those steps.

6. Technical Appendix (Not for Publication)
This technical appendix is organized as follows. First, it presents the proofs of theorems 2 and 3.
Second, it describes the equilibrium of the model in more detail. Third, it shows how parameter
drifting in the monetary policy rule does not appear in the …rst-order approximation. Fourth, it
focuses on describing how we e¢ ciently compute the model. Fifth, it o¤ers details on how we
elaborated the data. Sixth, it discusses the determinacy of the model. Finally, it includes some
additional empirical results not reported in the main text regarding the IRF of the model, the …t
of the model in comparison with some alternatives, and some counterfactuals.
6.1. Proofs
6.1.1. Theorem 2
We start by proving theorem 2. In this theorem, we characterize the …rst-order derivatives of
the policy functions h and g evaluated at the steady state. We …rst show that the …rst partial
derivatives of h and g with respect to any component of

t 1,

Ut , or

evaluated at the steady state

are zero (in other words, that the …rst-order approximation of the policy functions do not depend
on volatility shocks nor their innovations nor on the perturbation parameter). Before proceeding,
note that using (2), we can write Zt+1 , in a compact manner, as a function of Zt ;

t ; Et+1 ;

Ut+1 ,

and
Zt+1 = & (Zt ;
that using (3)

t+1

Et+1 ; Ut+1 ; ) ;

t;

can be expressed as a function of

t+1

and that using (5)

We show this result in three steps that basically repeat the same argument based on the
homogeneity of a system of linear equations:
1. We write the derivative of the i

as

0 for i2 2 f1; : : : ; kg and j 2 f1; : : : ; mg, this is a homogeneous system on [hUt ]ij1 and [gUt ]ij2
for i1 2 f1; : : : ; ng, i2 2 f1; : : : ; kg, and j 2 f1; : : : ; mg. Thus
[hUt ]ij1 = [gUt ]ij2 = 0
for i1 2 f1; : : : ; ng, i2 2 f1; : : : ; kg, and j 2 f1; : : : ; mg.
3. Finally, we write the derivative of the i
[F ]i = fYt+1

th element of F with respect to

as

[h ]i1 = 0

for i 2 f1; : : : ; k + n + mg. Since this is a homogeneous system on [h ]i1 and [g ]i2 for
i1 2 f1; : : : ; ng and i2 2 f1; : : : ; kg, we have that
[h ]i1 = [g ]i2 = 0
for i1 2 f1; : : : ; ng and i2 2 f1; : : : ; kg.

6.1.2. Theorem 3
Let us now prove theorem 3. We show, among other things, that the second partial derivatives of
h and g with respect to either log

or ui;t and any other variable but "i;t are also zero for any

i 2 f1; : : : ; mg. We divide the proof into three parts.

equations.

6.2. Equilibrium
In this section we describe the equilibrium conditions of the model. First, we introduce the ones
related to the household, then the ones related to the …rm and the monetary authority, and …nally
we present the market clearing and aggregation conditions.
6.2.1. Households
We can de…ne two Lagrangian multipliers,

jt ,

the multiplier associated with the budget con-

straint, and qjt (the marginal Tobin’s Q), the multiplier associated with the investment adjustment constraint normalized by

jt .

Thus, the …rst-order conditions of the household problem with

respect to cjt , bjt , ujt , kjt , and xjt can be written as:
dt (cjt

hcjt 1 )

jt

The …rst-order conditions of the “labor packer”imply a demand function for labor:
wjt

ljt =

ltd

and, together with a zero pro…t condition wt ltd =
Z

wt =

R1
0

8j

wjt ljt dj, an expression for the wage:
1

1
1
wjt

1

:

dj

Households follow a Calvo pricing mechanism when they set their wages. At the start of every
period, a randomly selected fraction 1

w

of households can reoptimize their wages. All other

households simply index their nominal wages given past in‡ation with an indexation parameter
w

2 [0; 1].
Since we postulated in the main text both complete …nancial markets for the households

and separable utility in consumption, the marginal utilities of consumption are the same for all
households. Thus, in equilibrium, cjt = ct , ujt = ut , kjt

1

= kt , xjt = xt , qjt = qt ;

jt

=

t,

and

wjt = wt .
The last two equalities are the most relevant to simplify our analysis: they tell us that the
shadow cost of consumption is equated across households and that all households that can reset
their wages optimally will do it at the same level wt . With these two results, and after several
steps of algebra, we …nd that the evolution of wages is described by two recursive equations:

ft =

1

and
ft = dt 't

wt

(36)

Taking advantage of the expression for the wage and that, in every period, a fraction 1
of households set wt as their wage and the remaining fraction

w

w

partially index their nominal

wage by past in‡ation, we can write the law of motion of real wage as:
wt1

w

=

wt1

t 1

w

t

+ (1

1

w ) wt

(37)

:

6.2.2. Firms
The …nal good producer is perfectly competitive and minimizes its costs subject to the production
function (24) and taking as given all intermediate goods prices pti and the …nal good price pt .
The optimality conditions of this problem result in a demand function for each intermediate good
with the classic form:

"

pit
pt

yit =

ytd

8i

where ytd is the aggregate demand and a price for the …nal good:
Z

pt =

1
1 "

1

pit1 " di

:

0

Each of the intermediate goods is produced by a monopolistic competitor. Intermediate good
producers produce the quantity demanded of the good by renting litd and kit

1

at prices wt and rt .

Then, by minimization, we have a marginal cost of:
mct =

1

1

wt1 rt
At

1

1

(38)

The marginal cost is constant for all …rms and all production levels given At , wt , and rt .
Given the demand function, the intermediate good producers set prices to maximize pro…ts.
However, when they do so, they follow the same Calvo pricing scheme as households. In each
period, a fraction 1

p

of intermediate good producers reoptimize their prices. All other …rms

partially index their prices by past in‡ation with an indexation parameter

2 [0; 1].

The solution for the …rm’s pricing problem has a recursive structure in two new auxiliary
variables gt1 and gt2 that take the form:
"

gt1 =

d
t mct yt +

p Et

51

t
t+1

gt2

gt+1
;

(40)

and
"gt1 = ("

1)gt2

(41)

where
t

pt
pt

=

(42)

is the ratio between the optimal new price (common across all …rms that can reset their prices)
and the price of the …nal good. With this structure, the price index follows:
"

p1t

1 "

=

p

t 1

or, normalizing by p1t " :

p1t

"
1

+ (1

p ) pt

1=

t 1

p

+ (1

t

t

:

(43)

6.2.3. The Monetary Authority
The model is closed with a monetary authority that sets the nominal interest rates by a modi…ed
Taylor rule described in (25).
6.2.4. Market Clearing and Aggregation
Aggregate demand is given by:
ytd = ct + xt +

1
t

[ut ] kt 1 :

(44)

By relying on the observation that the capital-labor ratio is constant across …rms, we can
derive that aggregate supply is:
yts

=

ltd

At (ut kt 1 )

1

zt

p
t

where:
p
t

=

Z

0

pit
pt

"

di

is the aggregate loss of e¢ ciency induced by price dispersion of the intermediate goods.
52

(45)

Market clearing requires that
yt = ytd = yts :

(46)

By the properties of Calvo’s pricing:
"
p
t

=

p
t 1

t 1

p

t

+ (1

p)

"
t

(47)

:

Finally, demanded labor is given by:

Z

(48)

ljt dj = lt

wjt

dj:

is the aggregate loss of labor input induced by wage dispersion among di¤erentiated types of labor.
Again, by Calvo’s pricing, this ine¢ ciency evolves as:
w
t

w

wt 1
wt

w

t 1

w
t 1

t

w) (

(49)

Thus an equilibrium is characterized by equations (30)-(49), the Taylor rule (25), the law of
motion for the structural shocks (augmented with the parameter drifts), and the law of motion
for the volatility shocks.
6.3. Non-linearities in Parameter Drifting
We argued in the main text that, since we wanted to consider the e¤ects of stochastic volatility
on our model, it was of the essence to deal with higher-order approximations. In this section
we argue that higher-order approximations are also key to dealing with parameter drifting in the
Taylor rule. The reason is that parameter drifting disappears from a linear solution. To see this,
take the Taylor rule de…ned in (25) (assuming only in this paragraph and to simplify notation
that

y

= 0 and log

t

= 0) and let us rewrite it:

bt ; R
bt 1 ; b t ; b
f R

;t ; " t

b

= expRt

exp

53

b

R Rt 1 +(1

R)

exp

b ;t

b t+

"

t

= 0:

where we have expressed each variable vart in terms of log deviation with respect to the steady
state, vd
art = log vart

log var. The log-linear approximation of f around the steady state is

bt ; R
bt 1 ; b t ; b
f R

;t ; " t

bt + f2 (0) R
bt
' f1 (0) R

1

+ f3 (0) b t + f4 (0) b

;t

+ f5 (0) " t :

where fi (0) is the …rst derivative of the function f evaluated at (0; 0; 0; 0; 0) with respect to the
variable i. Note that:
bt ; R
bt 1 ; b t ; b
f4 R

;t ; " t

Clearly, f4 (0) = 0 and b

;t

=

(1

R)

b t expb

;t

exp

b

R Rt 1 +(1

R)

exp

b ;t

b t+

"

t

:

does not play any role in this …rst-order approximation. This is

the consequence of one variable (

t)

being raised to another variable (

;t ).

Thus, the log-linear

approximation of the Taylor rule is:
bt ; R
bt 1 ; b t ; b
f R

which does not depend on

;t ;

;t ; "mt

bt
'R

b

R Rt 1

(1

but only on the steady state

R)

bt +

"

t

(50)

and it is exactly the same

expression as the one without parameter drifting. Hence, in order to capture parameter drifting
in the Taylor rule, we need, at least, to perform a second-order approximation.

In this section, we provide some more details regarding the computation of the paper. We generate
all the derivatives required by our second-order perturbation with Mathematica 6.0. In that
way, we do not need to recompute the derivatives, the most time-intensive step, for each set of
parameter values in our estimation. Once we have all the relevant derivatives, we export them
automatically into Fortran …les. This whole process takes about 3 hours. Then, we compile the
resulting …les with the Intel Fortran Compiler version 10:1:025 with IMSL. Previous versions
failed to compile our project because of the length of some of the expressions. Compilation takes
about 18 hours. The project has 1798 …les and occupies 2:33 Gbytes of memory.
The next step is, for given parameter values, to compute the …rst- and second-order approximation to the decision rules around the deterministic steady state using the analytic derivatives
we found before. For this task, Fortran takes around 5 seconds. Once we have the solution, we
54

approximate the likelihood using the particle …lter with 10; 000 particles. This number delivered
a good compromise between accuracy and time to compute the likelihood. The evaluation of one
likelihood requires 22 seconds on a Dell server with 8 processors. Once we have the likelihood
evaluation, we guess new parameter values and we start again. This means that drawing 5,000
times from the posterior (even forgetting about the initial search over a grid of parameter values)
takes around 38 hours.
It is important to emphasize that the Mathematica and Fortran code were highly optimized
in order to 1) keep the size of the project within reasonable dimensions (otherwise, the compiler
cannot parse the …les and, even when it can, it delivers code that is too ine¢ cient) and 2) provide
a fast computation of the likelihood.
Perhaps the most important task in that optimization was the parallelization of the Fortran
code using OPENMP as well as the compilation options: OG (global optimizations) and Loop Unroll.
In addition, we tailored specialized code to perform the matrix multiplications required in the …rstand second-order terms of our model solution.
Implementing corollary 1 requires the solution of a linear system of equations and the computation of a Jacobian. For our particular application, we found that the following sequence of
LAPACK operations delivered the fastest solution:
1. DGESV (computes the solution to a real system of linear equations A X = B).
2. DGETRI (computes the inverse of a matrix using the LU factorization from the previous line).
3. DGETRF (helps to compute the determinant of the inverse from the previous line).
Without the parallelization and our optimized code, the solution of the model and evaluation
of its likelihood take about 70 seconds.
With respect to the random-walk Metropolis-Hastings, we performed an intensive process of
…ne-tuning of the chain, both in terms of initial conditions as well as in terms of getting the
right acceptance level. The only other important remark is to remember that as pointed out by
McFadden (1989) and Pakes and Pollard (1989), we must keep the random numbers used for
resampling in the particle …lter constant across draws of the Markov chain. This is required to
achieve stochastic equi-continuity, and even if this condition is not strictly necessary in a Bayesian
framework, it reduces the numerical variance of the procedure, which was a serious concern for us
given the complexity of our problem.
55

6.5. Construction of Data
When we estimate the model, we make the series provided by the National Income and Product
Accounts (NIPA) consistent with the de…nition of variables in the theory. The main adjustment
we undertake is to express both real output and real gross investment in consumption units. Our
model implies that there is a numeraire in terms of which all the other prices need to be quoted.
We pick consumption as the numeraire. The NIPA, in comparison, uses an index of all prices
to transform nominal GDP and investment into real values. In the presence of changing relative
prices, such as the ones we have seen in the U.S. over the last several decades with the fall in the
relative price of capital, NIPA’s procedure biases the valuation of di¤erent series in real terms.
We map theory into the data by computing our own series of real output and real investment.
To do so, we use the relative price of investment, de…ned as the ratio of an investment de‡ator
and a de‡ator for consumption. The denominator is easily derived from the de‡ators of nondurable goods and services reported in the NIPA. It is more complicated to obtain the numerator
because, historically, NIPA investment de‡ators were poorly constructed. Instead, we rely on the
investment de‡ator computed by Fisher (2006). Since the series ends early in 2000.Q4, we have
extended it to 2007.Q1 by following Fisher’s methodology.
For the real output per capita series, we …rst de…ne nominal output as nominal consumption
plus nominal gross investment. We de…ne nominal consumption as the sum of personal consumption expenditures on non-durable goods and services. We de…ne nominal gross investment as
the sum of personal consumption expenditures on durable goods, private residential investment,
and non-residential …xed investment. Per capita nominal output is equal to the ratio between
our nominal output series and the civilian non-institutional population between 16 and 65. To
obtain per capita values, we divide the previous series by the civilian non-institutional population
between 16 and 65. Finally, real wages are de…ned as compensation per hour in the non-farm
business sector divided by the CPI de‡ator.
6.6. Determinacy of Equilibrium
We mentioned in the main text that the estimated value of

(1.045 in levels) guarantees local

determinacy of the equilibrium. To see this note that, for local determinacy, the relevant part
of the solution of the model is only the linear, …rst-order component. This component depends
on

, the mean policy response, and not on the current value of
56

t.

The economic intuition is

that local unicity survives even if

t

temporarily violates the Taylor principle as long as there is

reversion to the mean in the policy response and, thus, the agents have the expectation that

t

will satisfy the Taylor principle on average. For a related result in models with Markov-switching
regime changes, see Davig and Leeper (2006). While we cannot …nd an analytical expression
for the determinacy region, numerical experiments show that, conditional on the other point
estimates, values of
to values of

above 0.98 ensure uniqueness. Since the likelihood assigns zero probability

lower than 1.01, well inside the determinacy region, multiplicity of local equilibria

is not an issue in our application.
6.7. Impulse Response Functions
As a check of our estimates, we plot the IRFs generated by the model to a monetary policy shock.
This exercise is an important test. If the IRFs match the shapes and sizes of those gathered
by time series methods such as SVARs, it will strengthen our belief in the rest of our results.
Otherwise, we should at least understand where the di¤erences come from.
Auspiciously, the answer is positive: our model generates dynamic responses that are close to
the ones from SVARs (see, for instance, Sims and Zha, 2006). The left panel of …gure 6.1 plots the
IRFs to a monetary shock of three variables commonly discussed in monetary models: the federal
funds rate, output growth, and in‡ation. Since we have a non-linear model, in all the …gures in
this section, we report the generalized IRFs starting from the mean of the ergodic distribution
(Koop, Pesaran, and Potter, 1996). After a one-standard-deviation shock to the federal funds
rate, in‡ation goes down in a hump-shaped pattern for many quarters and output growth drops.
The right panel of …gure 6.1 plots the IRFs after a one-standard-deviation innovation to the
monetary policy shock computed conditional on …xing

t

to the estimated mean during the tenure

of each of three di¤erent chairmen of the Board of Governors: the combination Burns-Miller,
Volcker, and Greenspan. This exercise tells us how the variation on the systematic component
of monetary policy has a¤ected the dynamics of aggregate variables. Furthermore, it allows a
comparison with numerous similar exercises done in the literature with SVARs where the IRFs
are estimated on di¤erent subsamples.
The most interesting di¤erence is that the response of output growth under Volcker was the
mildest: the estimated average stance of monetary policy under his tenure reduces the volatility
of output. In‡ation responds moderately as well since the agents have the expectation that future
57

shocks will be smoothed out by the monetary authority. This …nding also explains why the
IRFs of the interest rate are nearly on top of each other for all three periods: while we estimate
that monetary policy responded more during Volcker’s years for any given level of in‡ation than
under Burns-Miller or Greenspan, this policy lowers in‡ation deviations and hence moderates the
actual movement along the equilibrium path of the economy. Moreover, this second set of IRFs
already points out one important result of this paper: we estimate that monetary policy under
Burns-Miller and Greenspan was similar, while it was di¤erent under Volcker. This …nding will
be reinforced by the results we present in the main body of the text.

Figure 6.1: IRFs to a Monetary Policy Shock, Unconditional and Conditional
For completeness, we also plot, in …gure 6.2, the IRFs to each of the other four shocks in
our model: the two preferences shocks (intertemporal and intratemporal) and the two technology
shocks (investment-speci…c and neutral). The behavior of the model is standard. A one-standarddeviation intertemporal preference shock raises output growth and in‡ation because there is an
increase in the desire for consumption in the current period. The intratemporal shock lowers
output because labor becomes less attractive, driving up the marginal costs and, with it, prices.
The two supply shocks raise output growth and lower in‡ation by increasing productivity. All of
those IRFs show that the behavior of the model is standard.

6.8. Model Comparison
Another use of our procedure to evaluate the likelihood function is to compare our model against
alternative models -or alternative versions of the same model. For instance, a natural question
is to compare our benchmark model with stochastic volatility and parameter drifting with a
version without parameter drifting but with stochastic volatility. That is: once we have included
stochastic volatility, is it still important to allow for changes in monetary policy to account for
the time-varying volatility of aggregate data in the U.S.?
Given our Bayesian framework, a natural approach for model comparison is the computation
of log marginal data densities (log MDD) and log Bayes factors. Let us focus on the proposed
example of comparing the full model with stochastic volatility and parameter drifting (drift) with
a version without parameter drifting (no drift) but with stochastic volatility. In this second case,
we have two fewer parameters,

and

(but we still have

). To ease notation, we partition

20

the parameter vector

= e;

as

; where e is the vector of all the other parameters,

;

common to the two versions of the model.

Given that our priors are 1) uniform, 2) independent of each other, and 3) cover all the areas
where the likelihood is (numerically) positive, and that 4) the priors on e are common across the
two speci…cations of the model, we can write

p YT = Ydata;T ; ; drift d + log p (e) + log p

) are constants and

; no drift = log

Thus

p YT = Ydata;T ; e; no drift de + log p (e) :

tells us how much better the version with parameter drift …ts the data in comparison with the
version with no drift. The last two terms, log p

extra parameters.
We estimate the log MDDs following Geweke’s (1998) harmonic mean method. This requires
us to generate a new draw of the posterior of the model for the speci…cation with no parameter
R
drift to compute log p YT = Ydata;T ; e; no drift de. After doing so, we …nd that
log Bdrift, no drift = 126:1331 + log p

+ log p (

)

This expression shows a potential problem of Bayes factors: by picking uniform priors for

60

and

spread out over a su¢ ciently large interval, we could overcome any di¤erence in

…t. But the prior for

is pinned down by our desire to keep that process stationary, which

imposes natural bounds in [ 1; 1] and makes log p
degree of freedom left: our choice of log p (

=

0:6931. Thus, there is only one

). Any sensible prior for

will only put mass

in a relatively small interval: the point estimate is 0:1479, the standard deviation is 0:002, and
the likelihood is numerically zero for values bigger than 0.2. Hence, we can safely impose that
log p (

)>

1 (log p (

)=

1 would imply a uniform prior between 0 and 2:7183, a considerably

wider support than any evidence in the data), and conclude that log Bdrift, no drift > 124:4400. This
is conventionally considered overwhelming evidence in favor of the model with parameter drift
(Je¤reys, 1961, for instance, suggests that di¤erences bigger than 5 are decisive). Thus, even after
controlling for stochastic volatility, the data strongly prefer a speci…cation where monetary policy
has changed over time. This …nding, however, does not imply that volatility shocks did not play
an important role in the time-varying volatilities of U.S. aggregate time series. In fact, as we will
see in the next section of this appendix, they were a key mechanism in accounting for it.4
It has been noted that the estimation of log MDDs is dangerous because of numerical instabilities in the evaluation of the integral log marginal data density (log MDD). This concern is
particularly relevant in our case, since we have a large model saddled with burdensome computation. Thus, as a robustness analysis, we also computed the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
(Schwarz, 1978). The BIC, which avoids the need to handle the integral in the log MDD, can be
understood as an asymptotic approximation of the Bayes factor that also automatically penalizes
for extra parameters. The BIC of model i is de…ned:
BICi =

2 ln p YT = Ydata;T ; b; i + ki ln n

where b is the maximum likelihood estimator (or, given our ‡at priors, the mode of the posterior),

ki is the number of parameters, and n is the number of observations. Then, the BIC of the model
4

A formal comparison with the case without stochastic volatility is more di¢ cult, since we are taking advantage
of its presence to evaluate the likelihood. Fortunately, Justiniano and Primiceri (2008) and Fernández-Villaverde
and Rubio-Ramírez (2007) estimate models similar to ours with and without stochastic volatility (in the …rst case,
using only a …rst-order approximation to the decision rules of the agents and in the second with measurement
errors). Both papers …nd that the …t of the model improves substantially when we include stochastic volatility. Finally, Fernández-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramírez (2008) compare a model with parameter drifting and no stochastic
volatility with a model without parameter drifting and no stochastic volatility and report that parameter drifting
is also strongly preferred by the likelihood.

course, with a new point estimate of the other parameters) BICno drift =

7; 484:7. The di¤erence is, therefore, of over 138 log points, which is again overwhelming evidence
in favor of the model with parameter drifting.
6.9. Historical Counterfactuals
One important additional exercise is to quantify how much of the observed changes in the volatility of aggregate U.S. variables can be accounted for by changes in the standard deviations of
shocks and how much by changes in policy. To accomplish this, we build a number of historical
counterfactuals. In these exercises, we remove one source of variation at a time and we measure
how aggregate variables would have behaved when hit only by the remaining shocks. Since our
model is structural in the sense of Hurwicz (1962) (it is invariant to interventions, including shocks
by nature such as the ones we are postulating), we will obtain an answer that is robust to the
Lucas critique.
In the next two subsections, we will always plot the same three basic variables that we used in
section 4 of the main text: in‡ation, output growth, and the federal funds rate. Counterfactual
histories of other variables could be built analogously. Also, we will have vertical bars for the
tenure of each chairman, following the same color scheme as in section 4.
6.9.1. Counterfactual I: Switching Chairmen
In our …rst counterfactual, we move one chairman from his mandate to an alternative time period.
For example, we appoint Greenspan as chairman during the Burns-Miller years. By that, we mean
that the Fed would have followed the policy rule dictated by the average

t

estimated during

Greenspan’s time while starting from the same states as Burns-Miller and su¤ering the same
shocks (both structural and of volatility). We repeat this exercise with all the other possible
combinations: Volcker in the Burns-Miller decade, Burns-Miller in Volcker’s mandate, Greenspan
in Volcker’s time, Burns-Miller in the Greenspan years, and, …nally, Volcker in Greenspan’s time.
It is important to be careful in interpreting this exercise. By appointing Greenspan at Volcker’s
time, we do not literally mean Greenspan as a person, but Greenspan as a convenient label for a
particular monetary policy response to shocks that according to our model were observed during
62

his tenure. The real Greenspan could have behaved in a di¤erent way, for example, as a result of
some non-linearities in monetary policy that are not properly captured by a simple rule such as the
one postulated in section 3. The argument could be pushed one step further and we could think
about the appointment of Volcker as an endogenous response of the political-economic equilibrium
to high in‡ation. In our model agents have a probability distribution regarding possible changes in
monetary policy in the next periods, but those changes are uncorrelated with current conditions.
Therefore, our model cannot capture the endogeneity of policy selection.
Another issue that we sidelined is the evolution of expectations. In our model, agents have
rational expectations and observe the changes in monetary policy parameters. This hypothesis
may be a poor approximation of the agents’behavior in real life. It could be the case that

t

was

high in 1984, even though in‡ation was already low by that time, because of the high in‡ationary
expectations that economic agents held during most of the 1980s (this point is also linked to issues
of commitment and credibility that our model does not address). While we see all these arguments
as interesting lines of research, we …nd it important to focus …rst on our basic counterfactual.
Moments In table 6.1, we report the mean and the standard deviation of in‡ation, output
growth, and the federal funds rate in the observed and in the sets of counterfactual data. In‡ation
was high with Burns-Miller, fell with Volcker, and stayed low with Greenspan. Output growth
went down during the Volcker years to recover with Greenspan. The federal funds rate reached its
peak with Volcker. The standard deviation of output growth fell from 4.7 in Burns-Miller’s time
to 2.45 with Greenspan, a cut in half. Similarly, in‡ation volatility fell nearly 54 percent and the
federal funds rate volatility 5 percent.
But table 6.1 also tells us one important result: time-varying monetary policy signi…cantly
a¤ected average in‡ation. In particular, Volcker’s response to in‡ation was strong and switching
him to either Burns-Miller’s or Greenspan’s time would have reduced average in‡ation dramatically. But it also tells us other things: contrary to the conventional wisdom, our estimates suggest
that the stance of monetary policy against in‡ation under Greenspan was not strong. In BurnsMiller’s time, the monetary policy under Greenspan would have delivered slightly higher average
in‡ation, 6.83 versus the observed 6.23, accompanied by a lower federal funds rate and lower output growth, 1.89 versus the observed 2.03. The di¤erence is even bigger in Volcker’s time, during
which average in‡ation would have been nearly 1.4 percent higher, while output growth would

63

have been virtually identical (1.34 versus 1.38). The key for this …nding is in the behavior of the
federal funds rate, which would have increased only by 9 basis points, on average, if Greenspan
had been in charge of the Fed instead of Volcker. Given the higher in‡ation in the counterfactual,
the higher nominal interest rates would have meant much lower real rates. The counterfactual
of Burns-Miller in Greenspan’s and Volcker’s time casts doubt on the malignant reputations of
these two short-lived chairmen, at least when compared with Greenspan. Burns-Miller would have
brought even slightly lower in‡ation than Greenspan, thanks to a higher real federal funds rate
and a bit higher output growth. However, Burns-Miller would have delivered higher in‡ation than
Volcker.

This is an important empirical …nding: according to our model, time-varying monetary policy signi…cantly a¤ected average in‡ation. While Volcker’s response to in‡ation was strong,
Greenspan’s response was milder and he seems to have behaved quite similarly to how BurnsMiller would have behaved.
Counterfactual Paths An alternative way to analyze our results is to plot the whole counterfactual histories summarized in table 6.1. We …nd it interesting to plot the whole history
because changes in the economy’s behavior in one period will propagate over time and we want
to understand, for example, how Greenspan’s legacy would have molded Volcker’s tenure. Also,

64

plotting the whole history allows us to track the counterfactual response of monetary policy to
large economic events such as the oil shocks.
In …gure 6.3, we move to Burns-Miller being reappointed in Greenspan’s time. This plot
suggests that the di¤erences in monetary policy under Greenspan and Burns-Miller may have
been overstated by the literature.

answer is: lower in‡ation and interest rates. Our estimates also suggest that Volcker would have
reduced price increases with little cost to output.

Our …nal exercise is to plot, in …gure 6.6, the counterfactual in which we move Volcker to the
time of Burns-Miller. The main …nding is that in‡ation would have been rather lower, especially
because the e¤ects of the second oil shock would have been much more muted. This counterfactual
is plausible: other countries, such as Germany, Switzerland, and Japan, that undertook a more
aggressive monetary policy during the late 1970s were able to keep in‡ation under control at levels
below 5 percent at an annual rate, while the U.S. had peaks of price increases over 10 percent.

6.9.2. Counterfactual II: No Volatility Changes
In our second historical counterfactual, we compute how the economy would have performed in
the absence of changes in the volatility of the shocks, that is, if the volatility of the innovation of
the structural shocks had been …xed at its historical mean. To do so, we back out the smoothed
structural shocks as we did in section 4.7 and we feed them to the model, given our parameter
point estimates and the historical mean of volatility, to generate series for in‡ation, output, and
the federal funds rate.
Moments Table 6.2 reports the moments of the data (in annualized terms) and the moments
from the counterfactual history (no s.v. in the table stands for “no stochastic volatility”). In both
cases, we include the moments for the whole sample and for the sample divided before and after
67

1984.Q1, a conventional date for the start of the great moderation (McConnell and Pérez-Quirós,
2000). In the last two rows of the table, we compute the ratio of the moments after 1984.Q1 over
the moments before 1984.Q1. The benchmark model with stochastic volatility plus parameter
drifting replicates the data exactly.
Some of the numbers in table 6.2 are well known. For instance, after 1984, the standard
deviation of in‡ation falls by nearly 60 percent, the standard deviation of output growth falls by
44 percent, and the standard deviation of the federal funds rate falls by 39 percent. In terms of
means, after 1984, there is less in‡ation and the federal funds rate is lower, but output growth is
also 15 percent lower.

The table also re‡ects the fact that without volatility shocks, the reduction in volatility observed after 1984 would have been noticeably smaller. The standard deviation of in‡ation would
have fallen by only 13 percent, the standard deviation of output growth would have fallen by 16
percent, and the standard deviation of the federal funds rate would have fallen by 35 percent, that
is, only 33, 20, and 87 percent, respectively, of how much they would have fallen otherwise. We
must resist here the temptation to undertake a standard variance decomposition exercise. Since
we have a second-order approximation to the policy function and its associated cross-product
terms, we cannot neatly divide total variance among the di¤erent shocks as we could do in the
linear case.
68

Table 6.2 documents that, while time-varying policy is re‡ected in changes of average in‡ation, volatility shocks a¤ect the standard deviation of the observed series. Without time-varying
volatility the decrease in observed volatility would not have been nearly as big as we observed
in the data. Hence, while changes in the systematic component of monetary policy account for
changes in average in‡ation, volatility shocks account for changes in the standard deviation of
in‡ation, output growth and interest rates observed after 1984. Also, without stochastic volatility,
output growth would have been quite lower on average.
Counterfactual Paths Figure 6.7 compares the whole path of the counterfactual history (blue
line) with the observed one (red line). Figure 6.7 tells us that volatility shocks mattered throughout
the sample. The run-up in in‡ation would have been much slower in the late 1960s (in‡ation would
have actually been negative during the last years of Martin’s tenure) with small e¤ects on output
growth or the federal funds rate (except at the very end of the sample). In‡ation would not
have picked up nearly as much during the …rst oil shock, but output growth would have su¤ered.
During Volcker’s time, in‡ation would also have fallen faster with little cost to output growth.
These are indications that both Burns-Miller and Volcker su¤ered from large and volatile shocks
to the economy. In comparison, during the 1990s, in‡ation would have been more volatile, with a
big increase in the middle of the decade. Similarly, during those years, output growth would have
been much lower, with a long recession between 1994 and 1998, and the federal funds rate would
have been prominently higher. Con…rming the results presented in section 4 of the paper, this is
another manifestation of how placid the 1990s were for policy makers.
