    "abstract": "\n\nA currency\u2019s essential feature is to be a medium of exchange. We leverage a quasi-natural experiment\u2014El Salvador as the \ufb01rst country to make bitcoin legal tender\u2014to study a cryptocurrency\u2019s potential to be used in daily transactions. The government also launched and provided incentives to download and use a digital wallet named Chivo, which shares features with Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and allows users to trade bitcoin and dollars. Were Chivo Wallet and bitcoin actually adopted after this \u201cbig push\u201d? Conducting a representative face-to-face survey and relying on blockchain data to obtain all Chivo transactions, we document how usage of digital payments and bitcoin is low, concentrated, and has been decreasing over time. We \ufb01nd that privacy concerns are key barriers to adoption, which speaks to a policy debate on crypto and CBDCs that has had anonymity at its core. We also estimate the technology\u2019s adoption cost and its network externalities.\n\n",
