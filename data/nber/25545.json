    "abstract": "\n\nOne of the U.S. Patent and Trademark O\ufb03ce\u2019s (USPTO) most commanding powers is to compel inventions into secrecy, withholding patent rights and prohibiting disclosure, to prevent technology from leaking to foreign competitors. This paper studies the impacts of compulsory secrecy on \ufb01rm invention and the wider innovation system. In World War II, USPTO issued secrecy orders to >11,000 patent applications, which it rescinded en masse at the end of the war. Compulsory secrecy caused implicated \ufb01rms to shift their patenting away from treated classes, with e\ufb00ects persisting through at least 1960. It also restricted commercialization and impeded follow-on innovation. Yet it appears it was e\ufb00ective at keeping sensitive technology out of public view. The results provide insight into the e\ufb00ectiveness of compulsory secrecy as a regulatory strategy and into the roles, and impacts, of formal intellectual property in the innovation system.\n\n",
