Anticipated Protectionist Policies, Real Exchange Rates
and the Current Account

ABSTRACT

In this paper a general equilibrium intertemporal model, with
optimizing consumers and producers, is developed to analyze how the antici-

pation of future import

tariffs affects real exchange rates and the

current account. The model is completely real, and considers a small open
economy that produces and consumes three goods each period. It is shown
that, without imposing rigidities or adjustment costs, interesting paths for

the equilibrium real exchange rate can be generated. In particular "equi-

librium overshooting" can be observed. Precise conditions under which an
anticipated future import tariff will worsen the current account in period 1

are derived. Several ways in which the model can be extnded are also
discussed in detail. The results obtained from this model have important
implications for the analysis of real exchange rate misalignment and
overvaluation.

The growing U.S. external imbalance of the last few years has generated

protectionist sentiments in a number of quarters. As a result, talks of new
trade legislation that would impose higher import tariffs have become quite

common. More recently, there has also been a growing concern regarding the
behavior of the real value of the dollar. In particular a number of
observers have argued that protectionist policies are required to

halt its decline) Moreover, this protectionist mood has also
affected a number of other countries, both industrialized and less
developed.

Although international trade theorists have developed models that
explain the contemporaneous effects of import tariffs on the trade and
current accounts, there has been little work on how the anticipation of

future import tariff will affect today's current account.2 However, this is
an important issue, since usually the enactment of restrictive commercial

policies is preceded by long discussions and parliamentary debates. In
other cases the public's anticipation of future tariffs are not material-

ized. Nevertheless, the sole fact that some restrictive legislation was
expected may affect today's current account, as well as the path of
equilibrium real exchange rates.

The purpose of this paper is to develop an optimizing general
equilibrium model of a real economy to investigate the way in which
anticipated future import tariffs affect the path of equilibrium real

exchange rates and the current account balance. The model is general
enough, however, to analyze the effects of other disturbances such as

permanent tariffs and terms of trade shocks. The model presented here
considers the case of a small open economy where optimizing firms and
consumers produce and consume three goods --

importables,

exportables, and

2

nontradables. Foreign borrowing is allowed, and the only constraint faced
by the nationals of this country is that the discounted value of the sum of

the current account balances equals zero. There is no uncertainty, and
agents have perfect foresight. The model is completely real and is solved
using duality theory.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section I an intertemporal
general equilibrium model of a (small) real economy with optimizing

consumers and producers is developed. Here the concept of equilibrium RER
in an intertemporal setting is discussed, and the modeling strategy is set

forward. Section II deals with the effects of the anticipation of a future
import tariff on equilibrium real exchange rates (RERs) and the current

account, under the assumption that initially there are no tariffs. In
Section III the impact of an anticipated hike in a previously existing

tariff is analyzed. Section IV deals with extensions, while Section V
contains the concluding remarks.

I.

The Model
In this section a three goods-two periods model is developed in order

to analyze how the anticipation of the imposition of import tariffs affects
the equilibrium path of real exchange rate and the current account in the
current period.

Consider the case of a small country that produces and consumes three
goods - -

importables

are two periods - -

the

(M) exportables (X) and nontradables (N). There
present (period 1) and the future (period 2) - -

and

foreign borrowing and lending is allowed at the exogenously given world

interest rate r*. The country faces an intertemporal budget constraint
that states that the discounted sum of the current account balances is zero.

3

There are a large number of producers and (identical) consumers, so that

perfect competition prevails. Consumers maximize utility subject to their
intertemporal budget constraint, whereas firms maximize profits in each
period, subject to existing technology and availability of factors of

production. In order to simplify the exposition it is assumed that there is
no investment (see, however, Section IV).

Assuming that the utility function is time separable, with each
subutility function homothetic, the representative consumer problem can be
stated as follows:

max W(TJ1(C,C,C), U2(C,C,c4)},
subject to:

C ÷ p1C ÷ q1C + 6*(C+p2C+q2C)
where W is the utility function; 1U and U2

(1)

are periods 1 and 2 sub-

utility functions assumed to be homothetic;

N, M and X in period i

Wealth

are consumption of

1,2; p' is the (domestic) price of

importables relative to exportables in period i

1,2; qi is the price of

nontradables relative to exportables in period i; and 6* is the world

discount factor equal to (l+r*)*
Wealth is the discounted sum of consumer's income in both periods.
Income, in turn, is given in each period by three components: (1) income

from labor services rendered to firms; (2) income from the renting of
capital stock that consumers own to domestic firms;

(3) and income ob-

tained from government transfers. These, in turn, correspond to the
proceeds from import tariffs which the government hands back to the public.
In this model, then, as in most of the international trade literature, the
government plays no active role besides imposing import tariffs, and

4

handling their proceeds back to households in a nondistortionary way.3
Given the nature of preferences, the consumer optimization process

takes place in two stages. First, the consumer decides how to allocate
his(her) wealth across periods. Second, he(she) decides how to distribute
each period (optimal) expenditure across the three goods.

It is assumed that firms use conventional technology to produce N, X

and M. There are three factors of production - -

capital,

labor and natural

resources. Consequently, factor price equalization does not hold in either

period. Producers' maximization problem can be stated in each period i, in

the following way (where V is the vector of factors of production w is a
vector of their rewards, and Q is output of good j in period i.)
max Profits

(p1Qj + q'Q + Q) -

(2)

subject to plausible technology.

In this small open economy the price of exportables is given from
abroad and the price of importables is in each period equal to the interna-

tional price of this type of goods (p*1) plus the (specific) import tariff

The simultaneous solutions of the consumers and producers optimization
problems, plus the requirement that the nontradable market clears every
period, and the full employment conditions will determine the equilibrium
path of nontradable prices, equilibrium real exchange rates in both periods,

quantities produced and consumed of X, M and N, the current account, and
factors rewards. A very convenient way of characterizing this country's
full equilibrium is by using duality theory.4 Equations (4) through (9)
succinctly summarize the internal and external equilibrium conditions for

5

this optimizing economy. Superscripts refer to periods (i.e., R2 is the
revenue function in period 2); subscripts refer to partial derivatives with

respect to that variable (i.e., R11 is the partial derivative of period
l's revenue function relative to q

(the price of nontradables in period

1); R222 is the second derivative of R2 with respect to q2 and p2).
The price of exportable is taken as the nuineraire:

R1(l,p1,q1;V) +

&*R2(l,p2,q2,V) ÷ r1(E1- R11) + 6*r2(E2-

market, the discount factor used in (1) is the world discount factor 8*.
Equations (5) and (6) are the equilibrium conditions for the nontradables
market in periods 1 and 2; in each of these periods the quantity supplied of

N (R11 and R22) has to equal the quantity demanded

and E2).

Equations (7) and (8) specify the relation between domestic prices of

income and total expenditure in that period.

Given our assumption of time separable utility function, expenditure in

periods 1 and 2 are gross substitutes. As a result all intertemporal cross

However, intratemporal cross demand effects -- E

can be positive or negative. The reason for this is that we have three
goods in each period; any two of them can be complements in demand. On the
supply side it is assumed that the three sectors compete for factors in each

period; all cross price effects are thus negative (R11

1.1. The ConceDt of "Equilibrium" Real Exchange Rate
In models with importables and exportables the definition of "the" real
exchange rate becomes "tricky", since the by-now traditional concept of

relative price of tradables to nontradables loses some meaning. The reason,

of course, is that if there are shocks that affect the price of X relative
to M, it is not possible to talk about the Hicksian composite "tradables"

anymore. In a way, in this type of model there are two RERs: the relative
price of importables to nontradables (p/q), and the relative price of
exportables to nontradables (l/q). For this reason, and in order to
simplify the exposition, in this paper we will focus on the (inverse) of

real exchange rate for exports q. Of course, once it is known how q
responds to changes in fundamentals, it is possible to compute, using simple
algebraic manipulations, the effect of shocks on any of the traditional
indexes of RER.

In the intertemporal model presented above there is not one equilibrium
value of the real exchange rate, but rather a path of equilibrium RERs.
Within this intertempora]. framework the equilibrium (exportable) RER in a

particular period is defined as the inverse of q that, for given values of
other variables such as world prices, technology and tariffs, equilibrates

simultaneously the external and internal (i.e., nontradables) sectors.5 In
terms of the model, the vector of equilibrium RERs is composed of those

8

(l/q')'s that simultaneously satisfy equations (4) through (8), for given
values of the other fundamental variables.

From the inspection of equations (4)-(9) it is apparent that exogenous
shocks in, say, the international terms of trade, will affect the vector of

equilibrium RERs through two interrelated channels. The first one is related
to intratemporal effects of terms of trade shocks on resource allocation and

consumption decisions. For example, as a result of a temporary worsening of
the terms of trade, there will be a tendency to produce more and consume less

of M in that period. This, plus the income effect resulting from the
worsening of the terms of trade will generate an incipient disequilibrium in
the nontradables market which will have to be resolved by a change in the

equilibrium q. In fact, if we assume that there is an absence of foreign
borrowing these intratemporal effects will be the only relevant ones.

However, with capital mobility, as in the current model, there is a second
intertemporal channel through which changes in exogenous variables will

affect the vector of equilibrium RERs. For example, in the case of a temporary worsening of the terms of trade, the consumption discount factor
will be affected, altering the intertemporal allocation of
consumption.6
Equations (4)-(9) can be manipulated to find out how the vector of
equilibrium RERs and the current account respond to exogenous shocks such as
changes in tariffs, disturbances to the international terms of trade,

international transfers, and changes in world interest rates. In order to
simplify the exposition it is assumed that initially there are no import

tariffs, so that r

= 0.

In Section III, however, the more general

case with positive initial tariffs is discussed.

intuition behind the positive slope of H1H1 is the following: An increase

from period 2 and towards period 1 expenditure. This will put pressure on

the market for N in period 1, and an incipient excess demand for N in
that period will develop. The reestablishment of nontradable equilibrium in
period 1 will require an increase the relative price of N.

The intuition behind this positive slope is analogous to that of the

result there will be a pressure on q2, which will have to increase to
reestablish equilibrium. Stability requires that the

The intersection of H1H1 and H2H2 at A characterize the (initial)
relative prices of the nontradable goods market in periods 1 and 2

compatible with the simultaneous attainment of intertemporal external equi-

librium and internal equilibrium in both periods. In order to make the exposition clearer we have assumed that these equilibrium prices

are equal; the 45° line passes through the initial equilibrium point

II. Anticipated Future Import Tariffs: The Zero Initial Tariffs Case
In this section we analyze how the anticipation of the future
imposition of an import tariff will affect the equilibrium RERs, and period

l's current account. We assume that the initial condition is characterized
by no import tariffs in either period

(r1 =

0).

In Section III we

look at the more general case of positive initial tariffs.

11.1. Equilibrium Real Exchange Rates
Consider the case where, in period 1, economic agents (correctly)

expect that the government will impose an import tariff r2 in period 2.

This will shift both the H1H1 and H2H2 schedules, generating a new
vector of equilibrium relative prices. Let's first consider the case of
H1H1. An anticipated import tariff in 2 means that the expected price of
imports in that period will increase, making future consumption relatively

more expensive. Consequently, via the intertemporal substitution effect,

Figure 1

11

consumers will substitute expenditure away from period 2 and into period 1.
This will result in an increase in the demand for all goods in period 1,

including nontradables, and in a higher q1. Consequently the H1H1 curve
will shift upward. From equation (5) it is possible to find the magnitude
of this vertical shift:

As this expression shows, this movement in the

H1H1 curve is a reflection

of the intertemporal degree of substitutability in consumption: it will be

greater or smaller depending on whether E 1 2 is large or small. In the
extreme case of no intertemporal substitution (E 1 2 = 0),

11

the H H

qp
schedule will be horizontal, and will not shift as a result of expected
future tariffs.

The imposition of an (anticipated) import tariff in period 2 will also

affect the H2H2 schedule. In this case, however, in addition to the
intertemporal effect already discussed, there will also be an intratemporal

effect related to the change in relative prices in period 2. Since the
expected teriff will make future consumption more expensive, the inter-

temporal effect will generate forces towards a reduction in q2, and a
leftward movement of H2H2. The intratemporal effect, on the other hand,
can either reinforce or tend to offset those forces. The higher domestic

price of imports in period 2 will reduce the quantity demanded of M in
that period. Depending on whether importables and nontradables are gross
substitutes or complements in consumption, in that period, the quantity

demanded of N will increase or decline. If M and N are complements,
(E 2 2

qp

< 0)

the higher tariff will reduce the demand for N in period 2,

12

and the H2H2 schedule may shift to the left.

If, however, N and M are

gross substitutes, the imposition of the period 2 tariff will increase the

demand for N. In this case the H2H2 curve will shift to the right.

22

Formally, the horizontal shift of H H
H2H2

can be obtained from equation (6):

It is clear from (13) that the indeterminacy stems from the fact that E

can be either positive or negative. A necessary condition for the H2H2

schedule to shift to the left is that N and M are complements, so that

< 0.

On the other hand, a sufficient condition for the H2H2 to

shift to the right is that E

Figure 2 illustrates two possible new equilibria. Point A
characterizes the initial equilibrium. Point

corresponds to the case

when N and M are gross substitutes and the intratemporal effect is
strong enough: the new (after tariff anticipation) equilibrium schedules
are

and 22 In this case the anticipation of an import tariff

results in a higher relative price of nontradables in periods 1 and 2. That
is, the equilibrium RER appreciates in both periods, as a result of the

expected tariff. Notice, however, that there is nothing in the model that
tells us which of the two curves shifts by more (see below for the exact

expression for (dq /dr )

and

2
2
(dq /dr )).

This

.

gives rise to the possib-

ility of some interesting equilibrium paths for the RERs. For example, it
is possible to observe an "equilibrium overshooting", where (relative to the
no-tariff case)

increases by more than 2 This would be the case if

the H1H1 shifts to the left by more than what H2H2 shifts to the right.

This will be the case if the new equilibrium point is above the 45° line,
and is illustrated in Figure 3.

Point C in Figure 2 is the new equilibrium under the assumption that
nontradables and importables are complements in consumption in period 2, and

that this effect dominates. In this case, as discussed, the

H2H2 schedule

will shift to the left to a position such as l2I42. A possible outcome is
the one described in Figure 2 where as a result of an anticipated tariff the
equilibrium path of the real exchange rate will be characterized by wide

swings: it will increase in period 1, and it will decline in period 2 below
its initial (pre-tariff) level. Although this path is clearly characterized
by equilibrium movements in each period, observers may think that the RER

has moved in the "wrong direction" in period 1. Notice that this type of

behavior of the RER can even happen if M and N are substitutes. The
H2H2 will shift to the left if the intertemporal effect dominates.
Figure 4 provides a diagrammatical illustration of four possible paths
for the real exchange rate in periods 1 and 2 as a result of the

anticipation of an import tariff. In these diagrams

benchmark for comparison.

and 2 are the equilibrium relative prices

in periods 1 and 2 in the anticipated tariff case. Panel (a) in Figure 3
illustrates what we have called "equilibrium overshooting" of the relative

price, where in the tariff case q1 and q2 are higher than in the nontariff case, but the adjustment implies an equilibrium reduction of q in
period 2. By analogy, case (b) can be called "equilibrium undershooting".

Here both 's are also higher than in the non-tariff case. Now, however,
the adjustment path requires an equilibrium increase of q in period 2,

14

over and above the higher q in period 1.

Panel (c) depicts the case where

the equilibrium RERs move in opposite directions in each period. In period
1 there is a real appreciation, relative to the non-tariff case, while in
period 2, the period when the tariff is actually imposed, there is a real

depreciation. As noted, a sufficient condition for this to be the case is

that E

2 2 < 0. Finally, panel (d) is the most "traditional" case, where

pq

as a consequence of the anticipated tariff the RER appreciates by the same
amount in both periods.

From equations (4), (5), (6) and (8) it is possible to formally find

the equilibrium changes in q1 and q2 as a result of the anticipated
import tariff:

EqlqlJ[R22 Eq2q2) - Eq2ql

Equations (14) and (15) formally confirm the preceding diagrammatic

analysis, showing that in this three good-two period model, an anticipated
import tariff can, in principle, generate interesting dynamic paths of the
equilibrium real exchange rate under a pure real equilibrium analysis.

11.2. The Current Account
From equation (9) an expression for the change of the current account
balance in period 1, as a result of the anticipation of a tariff in 2, can

be obtained:11

(16)

The presence of an E.. terni in every one of the RHS terms of
equation (16) clearly highlights the fact that the anticipated imposition of
a future tariff will affect the current account via intertemporal channels.

The first term in the RHS of equation (16) is negative and captures the
direct effect of the anticipation of a tariff in period 2 on the current

account in period 1. The intuition for this negative effect is straightfor-

ward. The anticipated higher period two tariff makes period 2 consumption
relatively more expensive, and as a result of this the public substitutes
consumption away from period 2 into period 1, generating a worsening of the

current account balance in period 1. The magnitude of this effect will

depend both on the intertemporal substitution effect E

1 2

and on the

It

initial share of imports on period 2 expenditure It22.

The second and third terms on the RHS of equation (16) are indirect
effects, that operate via changes in periods 1 and 2 equilibrium real

exchange rates. Since, as was established above, the signs of (dq'/dr2)

and (dq2/dr2) cannot be determined a priori, the signs of these two terms
in (16) are generally undetermined, as will be the sign of equation (16) as

a whole. However, the interpretation of these two indirect terms is quite
straightforward within the intertemporal framework of the current model. If
the anticipated tariff results in an equilibrium real appreciation in period
1,

(dql/drZ) >

0,

there will be an offsetting force towards a current

account improvement. The reasoning is again simple. If the anticipated
tariff results in a higher equilibrium price of nontradables in period 1
(i.e., in a real appreciation in 1), there will be substitution away from
period 1 expenditure, generating an improvement in the current account in

16

that period. The third term on the RHS relates the change in period 2's RER
to period l's current account. If as a consequence of the anticipated

tariff q2 increases (see equation (15) above for the conditions under
which this will take place), there will be a tendency to substitute
expenditure away from period 2 into period 1, generating forces that will

tend to worsen period l's current account. On the contrary, if as a result
of the anticipated tariff there is a real depreciation in period 2,
(dq2/dr2) <

0,

expenditure will go down in period 1 with the consequence

improvement of the current account.

The total effect of the anticipation of an import tariff on period l's
current account will depend on the strength of the intertemporal price
effects, initial expenditure on income and nontradables, and on the effects

of the tariff on the RER vector. This result contrasts with the traditional
static view where the conditions for tariffs improving the current account

are related to imports and exports elasticities within each period. An
important result of this analysis is that, under very plausible conditions,
it is possible that the sole anticipation of the enactment of future

protectionist policies will worsen today's current account. Moreover, it is
possible to simultaneously observe a worsening of the current account and a
real depreciation; a combination that would puzzle a number of observers,
including the media.

III. The Case of Positive Initial Tariffs
If initially there are positive tariffs, the anticipation of a future
hike in tariffs will generate a first order negative income effect in period

2.12 Households will try to smooth consumption through time, and the effect
on consumption of this negative income effect will be spread across periods.

This income effect will result in a drop in demand for nontradables in
periods 1 and 2 and will generate downward pressure on the relative price of

N in both periods. This is because the reduction of real income associated
with the period 2 tariff hike will provoke an incipient excess supply of

nontradables in both periods. The reestablishment of equilibrium will
require a reduction in home goods prices. The presence of this income
effect will enhance the possibility of observing "interesting" dynamics in
the behavior of the equilibrium RERs, such as overshooting or opposite
movements:

In this case the income effect also plays a role in the reaction of the

IV. Temporary Tariffs. Permanent Tariffs and Other Extensions
The model developed above can be easily used to analyze the effects of
temporary and permanent tariffs on the path of equilibrium RERs and on the

current account. In particular, the diagrammatic analysis of Section II can
handle both of these cases. In the case of temporary tariffs (i.e., a
period 1 tariff only), it is easy to show that, once again, "equilibrium

overshooting" can result where the initial equilibrium relative price of N

(q1) increases - -

result as a consequence of temporary import tariff.

With respect to the current account, a temporary tariff can either

improve or worsen that period's current account balance. The intuition
behind this is analogous to the case of the anticipated tariff, discussed

above. More specifically:

The model developed in this paper can be extended in several

interesting directions. For example, the case of a large country can be
easily handled by specifying a second country with a similar structure, and

by adding the worldwide budget constraints. Also the case of shocks to the

international terms of trade (pl* and p2*) can be incorporated into the
discussion. In this case, however, it is not possible to ignore the income
effects. Even if the initial tariffs are zero, a worsening of the terms of
trade will have a first order (negative) income effect. Investment can also
be introduced into the analysis. Moreover, its incorporation will not alter
in a significant way the main results presented above. Once investment is
added, the interteniporal budget constraint has to be altered, and an

equation describing the process governing investment decisions has to be

added to our system. Denoting investment by I, and assuming that there is
time to build, the intertemporal budget constraint becomes:
Rl(l,ql,pl;Kl,Vl) + 8*R2(l,p2 ,q2;K1+I,V1)

+ r1(E1- R11) + 6*r2(E

Further assuming that investment decisions are governed by the condition

that in equilibrium Tobin's "q" equals 1, and that investment goods
correspond to the numeraire good, the investment equation is:

The manipulation of (20) and (21) and the two conditions for equilibrium in
the nontraded goods market in period 1 and 2 will now yield the corresponding expressions for changes in the RERs and the capital account.

Once

investment is added into the analysis the capital stock in period 2 becomes

20

an endogenous variable. More specifically, it is possible to relate

additions to the capital stock (dK) to anticipated changes in tariffs and
to real exchange rate changes:

V. Concluding Remarks
The analysis presented in this paper has shown that a fairly simple
real intertemporal model of a fully optimizing economy, with no rigidity or
adjustment costs, can generate a number of interesting paths for the equi-

librium real exchange rate, as a response to exogenous real disturbances.
This suggests that real equilibrium models may be able to explain a
nontrivial fraction (but not necessarily all) of observed RER movements.
For example, since terms of trade shocks are very common and quite

substantial in magnitude, it is possible that in a number of countries the
observed wide swings in RER are, at least in part, equilibrium movements
generated by the economy's reaction to terms of trade or other structural

(real) disturbances. This possibility is particularly important in light of
the recent interest by politicians and policymakers in real exchange rate
"disequilibrium".

In fact, in the last two years or so policy analyses have increasingly

focused on issues related to real exchange rate disequilibrium, and some

proposals aimed at actively intervening in the exchange market in ord

21

reduce real exchange rate "misalignment" have been discussed. These
proposals, however, would only make sense if recent RER movements in fact
represent a disequilibrium phenomenon, where the actual RER exhibits sus-

tamed departures from its equilibrium value. If, on the other hand, this
is not the case, and observed RER changes respond to "fundamentals,"

intervention could have counterproductive effects. It would seem, then,
that in order to fully understand RER behavior, and to propose policy
actions, it is first necessary to have a fully articulated theory on how the
equilibrium value of this relative price responds to different (real)

disturbances. Most of the recent exchange rates research, however, has
focused on nominal exchange rate determination, tending to ignore real

aspects of real exchange rate behavior. The model presented in this paper
provides a coherent fully optimizing model that can help analyze the way the

equilibrium RER reacts to these changes in "fundamentals". A next step
would then be to add to this model a monetary sector as well as short term
rigidities in a way such that issues related to disequilibrium and misalignment could be properly analyzed.
Another important result reported in this paper is the (likely)
possibility that an anticipated tariff will worsen today's current account.
This implies that if protectionism is thought of as a way to tackle current
account imbalances, the sole discussion of possible import tariffs in the
future will make things even worse today.

2For a somewhat different analysis of tariffs in an intertemporal
setting see Stockman and Dellas (1986).

3See, however, Edwards (1987) for a related model where the government
uses tariffs proceeds to finance its own consumption.

4See Dixit and Norman (1980) for the use of duality in static trade

models. Svenssen and Razin (1983) and Edwards and van Wijnbergen (1986) use
duality in intertemporal models without nontradables.
5Notice that implicit in this definition is the requirement of full
employment.

and the consumption discount factor. See also Svensson and Razin (1983) and
Edwards and van Wijnbergen (1986).

curve would be completely horizontal, with the H2H2 schedule being
completely vertical.

10The minus sign of Li1

is

a result of stability (see Appendix).

11As above we still assume that initial tariffs are equal to zero.
12The reason for this is the traditional efficiency effect of tariffs.

that the H2H2 schedule is steeper than the H1H1 schedule.
