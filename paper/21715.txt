ABSTRACT
Ethnic divisions have been shown to adversely affect economic performance and political
stability, especially in Africa, but the underlying reasons remain contested, with multiple
mechanisms potentially playing a role. We utilize lab experiments to isolate the role of one such
mechanism—ethnic preferences—which has been central in both theory and in the conventional
wisdom about the impact of ethnic differences. We employ an unusually rich research design,
collecting multiple rounds of experimental data with a large sample of 1,300 subjects in Nairobi;
employing within-lab priming conditions; and utilizing both standard and novel experimental
measures, as well as implicit association tests. The econometric approach was pre-specified in a
registered pre-analysis plan. Most of our tests yield no evidence of differential altruism towards
coethnics relative to non-coethnics. The results run strongly against the common presumption of
extensive ethnic bias among ordinary Kenyans, and suggest that other mechanisms may be more
important in explaining the negative association between ethnic diversity and economic and
political outcomes.

1. Introduction
Ethnic divisions have been shown to adversely affect economic performance and
political stability, especially in Africa (Easterly and Levine 1997, Cederman et al. 2007,
2011), but the underlying mechanisms remain contested. One channel that has played a
particularly central role in theory and is at the root of the conventional wisdom about
why ethnicity matters is that individuals exhibit greater altruism for coethnics, and
even antipathy toward non-coethnics (Vigdor 2002). Explanations of this sort, which
focus on ethnic preferences, contrast with explanations that stress the institutional and
technological factors that raise the transaction costs associated with cross-group
interactions, including difficulties in communication, imposing social sanctions and
enforcing social norms across group lines (Hardin 1995; Miguel and Gugerty 2005;
Habyarimana et al. 2007, 2009).
We study the strength of ethnic preferences in Nairobi, Kenya, a setting with
well-documented and politically salient ethnic divisions, utilizing lab experiments to
isolate this mechanism from other factors. While the term “ethnic preferences” is
sometimes used to refer to the correlation between group membership and preferences
over public policies (e.g., Alesina, Baqir and Easterly 1999, Alesina and LaFerrara 2005,
Lieberman and McClendon 2013), we use it here to refer specifically to the different
levels of altruism in within- versus cross-group interactions, a phenomenon we also
refer to as “ethnic bias”. Our approach is motivated by the frequency, in both academic
scholarship and popular accounts, with which outcomes in Africa are linked to ethnicity
by invoking this logic.
We employ an unusually rich research design that involves multiple rounds of
experimental data with a large sample of over 1300 subjects, including one round
immediately prior to a national election, when conventional wisdom would suggest
that coethnic bias should be particularly strong (Eifert et al. 2010, Snyder 2000). We
1

supplement this variation in real-world timing with within-lab priming designed to
increase the situational salience of particular issues and dimensions of social identity.
We measure preferences using both standard experimental games (e.g., Dictator and
Public-good games) and a more novel lab activity (the Choose-Your-Dictator game),
which captures expectations about the altruism of others. As a further check, we
employ an implicit association test (IAT) to capture underlying preferences free from
experimenter demand effects, a potential concern in contexts where overt expression of
ethnic bias may be socially undesirable. 1
The design and econometric approach were pre-specified in a registered preanalysis plan, incorporating adjustments for multiple hypothesis testing. Pre-analysis
plans are increasingly used in field experiments (Casey et al. 2012) but their use to date
in laboratory experimental studies has been limited.
Given the widely held views on both the strength and the negative implications
of ethnic preferences, our results are striking and optimistic. Most of our tests yield no
evidence of coethnic bias, while a few show evidence of a small degree of bias. This lack
of meaningful ethnic bias holds across multiple experimental measures and wellpowered statistical tests, including the IAT. Figure 1 summarizes evidence from the
Dictator game and the Public-good game. In both cases, the average level of
contribution to coethnic and non-coethnic partners is strikingly similar, within one
percentage point: 35.6% versus 35.4% in the Dictator game (Panel A), and 46.2% versus
46.4% in the Public-good game (Panel C). Participants’ beliefs about the contributions of
others in these games are similarly unaffected by their ethnic backgrounds, at 49.3% to
48.4% (Panel B) and 53.9% to 53.1% (Panel D), respectively. None of these differences

This design thus documents both the explicit and implicit biases suggested by dual-process theories in
social psychology (Chaiken and Trope 1999). Explicit bias is captured through the Choose-Your-Dictator
game, which documents conscious effortful calculations underlying ethnic bias. Implicit bias is measured
using the IAT. We are agnostic as to how exactly implicit and explicit biases combine to shape behavior,
as our design only aims to quantify the two types of processing potentially underlying ethnic bias.

are statistically distinguishable from zero. In the IAT, the average bias against members
of other ethnic groups is just 0.079 standard deviation units, roughly one sixth of the
average bias demonstrated by U.S. whites against blacks (Nosek et al. 2007).
These precisely estimated null effects are robust: they hold among almost all of
the demographic subgroups we pre-specified (including by gender, ethnic group, and
education); in the experimental round close in time to national elections, as much as in
the round conducted in the previous year; and across a range of priming conditions,
including primes for ethnic identity, political competition, and national identity. The
core null finding is also not the result of selective presentation of results on our part: the
econometric approach was pre-specified and, in a novel test, we present the distribution
of statistical significance levels for results contained in the main tables versus the full set
of pre-specified results.
It is a testament to the broad acceptance of the ethnic preferences mechanism that
these results appear surprising—especially given our Kenyan research site, which is
commonly associated with ethnic rivalry and which witnessed ethnic violence in the
aftermath of the disputed 2007 national elections that led to more than a thousand
deaths and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. Moreover,
modernization theorists have argued that African urban environments like Nairobi are
especially prone to ethnic antagonisms due to the combination of social heterogeneity
and the heightened competition for jobs and resources (Bates 1983, Melson and Wolpe
1970). So vis-a-vis both history and theory, our findings are unexpected.
It is worth being absolutely clear that we are not downplaying the role of
ethnicity in the study setting: ethnic divisions remain a prominent feature of
contemporary Kenyan society. Our findings simply suggest that the salience of ethnicity
may be due to mechanisms other than ethnic preferences. Indeed, notwithstanding the
conventional wisdom, there is actually more empirical evidence in favor of other
channels than there is for explanations rooted in ethnic preferences, at least in African
3

cases. Miguel and Gugerty (2005) argue that all ethnic groups in western Kenya have
strong preferences for funding local schools, but that diverse communities have far
worse voluntary local fundraising outcomes due to their inability to sanction freeriders. Building on the seminal work of Barkan and Chege (1989), Burgess et al. (2015)
document large-scale distortions in public roads investment in Kenya favoring the
president’s ethnic group. In their model, this is an equilibrium choice due to the
instrumental political benefits for rulers, but it does not rely on any coethnic bias
(although they cannot rule out that such bias is playing some role).
Habyarimana et al. (2007, 2009), perhaps the most similar prior study, provides
further evidence from lab experiments in urban Uganda that ethnic preference
explanations are less powerful than accounts emphasizing the different norms
governing coethnic and non-coethnic interactions, and on the role of within-group
sanctions to enforce them. Their results nonetheless raise questions about
generalizability: is ethnic bias equally weak elsewhere? Would results differ if
experiments had been conducted in closer proximity to national elections, when ethnic
identities are mobilized by politicians? Or if research subjects had been directly primed
to think in ethnic terms? Our study was designed to address precisely these questions.
At the same time, several studies have found mixed evidence on coethnic
preferences in African settings (Carlson 2015, Michelitch 2015, Dionne 2014, Grossman
and Honig 2015, Hjort 2014, Marx et al 2015, Loewen, Eady and Fowler 2014, Jeon 2013,
Voors et al. 2012). 2 The current study contributes to this emerging literature by
employing larger samples (and thus greater statistical power) and a larger number of
experimental measures and tests, all using a pre-specified set of research hypotheses.

Michelitch (2015) investigates whether proximity to Ghana’s 2008 election affects how coethnics and
non-coethnics (as well as copartisans and non-copartisans) bargain over taxi fares, and finds evidence
consistent with coethnic bias. While her research is similar in exploiting variation in real world context,
her field experimental design does not focus on isolating coethnic preferences.

We believe the results thus serve to crystallize that coethnic bias in African societies is
often less pronounced than is widely believed in either scholarly or popular debates. 3
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a theoretical
framework relevant for disentangling ethnically biased behavior and ethnic preferences
in the context of the lab games; section 3 describes the setting, experimental design, and
econometric approach; section 4 describes the data and empirical results; and the final
section concludes. The supplementary appendix contains additional theoretical results
(appendix A), tables and figures (appendix B), the lab experimental protocol and survey
instruments (appendix C), pre-analysis plans (appendix D), and the full set of prespecified results (appendix E).

2. A model of ethnic preferences and behavior
In the empirical analysis, we employ lab games to measure individual-level ethnic
biases in behavior. The theoretical framework developed below describes what can be
learned about ethnic bias in preferences from observing individual-level play in the
Dictator and Public-good games. Specifically, it reveals that, under the weak
assumption that subjects are not perfectly altruistic, a lack of observed coethnic bias in
behavior implies that there is no ethnic bias in individual preferences. Critically, it also
shows how ethnic bias in behavior is not necessarily driven by bias in ethnic preferences.
The model builds on Cappelen et al. (2007, 2013), where individuals make a
trade-off between selfish and other-regarding concerns when sharing a sum of money.
We extend the original model by introducing ethnic preferences so that it matches the
versions of our lab games where subjects have some information about the likely

There is related work on ethnicity in non-African settings, e.g., Fershtman and Gneezy (2001)’s seminal
contribution on the role of ethnicity in Israel, Fehr et al. (2013), Bauer et al. (2016), among others. This
work also relates to the analysis of in- vs. out-group behavior in social psychology (Tajfel 1982).

ethnicity of their partners. We present the baseline model in the context of a Dictator
game; afterward, we discuss how the model relates to the Public-good game.
Let mi be the individual’s fairness ideal. This could be an even split of the
endowment, although the exact value does not matter for measuring the degree of
observed ethnic bias in behavior. We introduce an ethnic bias in preferences, given by
qi, and an ethnicity indicator variable 𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗 , which takes the value one if the counterpart is
a non-coethnic and zero if a coethnic. The utility of an individual i is:
(𝑡𝑡 −𝑚𝑚 )2

(1)

𝑖𝑖
𝑖𝑖
𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) = (1 − 𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 ) − 2𝑏𝑏 �1+𝑛𝑛
𝑞𝑞 �
𝑖𝑖

𝑗𝑗 𝑖𝑖

where the endowment of money is given by 1, ti is the transfer to the other player, and bi
is the degree of egoism (𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖 ≥ 0), i.e., 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖 = 0 denotes perfect altruism.

The first term in equation 1 captures the utility component based on what the

decision-maker keeps for himself, and the second term is the decision-maker’s disutility
due to deviations from the fairness norm. Note that the disutility from deviations from
this norm depends on three factors, bi, qi and nj. In the limit as 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖 → ∞, the second term
tends to zero as egoism increases, and a fully egoistic decision-maker chooses ti = 0. At
the other end of the spectrum, for fully altruistic individuals 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖 → 0 , the second term

receives all the weight in the decision process, and ti = mi. The degree of ethnic bias in
preferences qi has an analogous effect when the other party is a non-coethnic, i.e., for
𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗 = 1. In that case, the larger is qi, the lower is the weight given to the fairness term,
and the smaller is the transfer to non-coethnics.

Note that for 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖 �1 + 𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖 � ≥ 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖 we have a corner solution, where the decision

maker keeps all the money for herself, 𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖∗ = 0. However, for an interior solution, the first
order condition for sharing implies:

𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖∗ = 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖 − 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖 (1 + 𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖 )

(2)

Sharing with a coethnic (CE) is then given by:
𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 = 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖 − 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖

(3a)
6

and with a non-coethnic (NCE):
𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 = 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖 − 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖 (1 + 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖 )

(3b)

A low level of sharing in this framework can be due to three factors: (i) a fairness ideal
that suggests a low level of sharing; (ii) a high level of egoism; or, when interacting with
a non-coethnic, (iii) a high level of ethnic bias in preferences. 4
The ethnic bias in behavior in the dictator game is thus given by:
𝐵𝐵 𝐷𝐷 = 𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 − 𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 = 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖

(4)

that is, how much more the decision-maker contributes when facing a coethnic instead
of a non-coethnic. Note that the value of mi is differenced out and does not matter for
our expression of ethnic bias.
A key implication of the model is that a strong observed ethnic bias in behavior
(𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖 ) is not necessarily the result of a high ethnic bias in preferences alone (high 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖 ), as
it may be driven primarily by egoism (high bi). Another important implication of the

model for our results is that, in a population with imperfect altruism (bi > 0) – a realistic
pattern that characterizes nearly all populations that have played the Dictator game – a
finding of no ethnic bias in behavior (𝐵𝐵 𝐷𝐷 = 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖 = 0) implies no ethnic bias in

preferences (qi = 0). This implication of the model will allow us to draw conclusions
about the extent of ethnic preferences in our sample based on ethnic bias in behavior.
So far, we have analyzed the implications of our model in the context of the
Dictator game. Similar reasoning applies to the Public-good game, where we can
employ an analogous utility-structure for respondent i when making a contribution ti to
the group fund. The main difference lies in the fairness-norm becoming group𝑔𝑔

dependent. Specifically, we assume that the fairness term is now given by 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖 =

𝑓𝑓�𝐸𝐸𝑔𝑔,−𝑖𝑖 [𝑡𝑡]�, where 𝐸𝐸𝑔𝑔,−𝑖𝑖 [𝑡𝑡] is individual i’s expectation about other group-member

An additional theoretical possibility that may be difficult to distinguish from ethnic bias in preferences
is the existence of different sharing norms (mi) when facing a coethnic and a non-coethnic. As shown
below, there is no indication of significantly different contributions to coethnics and non-coethnics in our
data, providing little evidence for either ethnic bias in preferences or different sharing norms.

7

contributions to the group fund of group g, and we assume 𝑓𝑓 ′ > 0. As such, the

difference in contributions in a coethnic versus non-coethnic group reflects both an
ethnic bias in preferences (as above), and in expectations about others’ contributions. If
other group members are expected to contribute less in a non-coethnic setting
compared to a coethnic setting, this should amplify the observed ethnic bias in terms of
Public-good game contributions.
In the lab, we also collected data on respondents’ stated beliefs about the
amounts other group members will contribute. Since cooperation can unravel in
voluntary Public-good games, as individuals tend to have a desire to contribute less
than they think that others are contributing (Fischbacher and Gachter 2010), we also
examine the difference between individual i’s contribution ti and her expectations about
𝑔𝑔

others’ contributions, 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖 . This difference is often interpreted as capturing the degree of
free-riding. Under further assumptions (discussed in Appendix A), the difference in
contributions minus beliefs in a coethnic versus a non-coethnic Public-good game
setting is again 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖 , as in the Dictator game, although the interpretation of this measure
is slightly different: in the Dictator game, it captures ethnic bias in generosity, whereas

in the Public-good game it can be thought of as ethnic bias in free-riding. As above for
the Dictator game, in a population with non-zero egoism (bi > 0), a finding of no ethnic
bias in behavior in the Public-good game implies no ethnic bias in preferences (qi = 0).

3. Setting, experimental protocol, and research design
3.1.

Setting, sample and timing

The study sample draws from two low-income neighborhoods in Nairobi, Kenya,
namely, Kibera, which was a focal point for the 2007-08 post-election violence, and
Viwandani. Subject recruitment was conducted through, and the experiments were
carried out at, the Busara Center for Behavioral Economics, a high-quality lab setting
8

similar to those in U.S. and European research institutions, with touch screen monitors
and headphones for audio instructions (to enable illiterate people to participate). To
enhance representativeness, recruitment was stratified by ethnic group, with five of the
six largest ethnic groups in Kenya well-represented, namely, the Kikuyu, Luo, Luhya,
Kamba, and Kisii groups (listed in order of size in both the Kenyan population and our
study sample); subject recruitment only occurred among members of these five groups.
Taken together, these five groups make up 82% of the Nairobi population according to
1999 Kenyan census data. 5 They also contain the two groups with the deepest historical
rivalry, Kikuyu and Luo. (The only major Kenyan ethnic group not represented in the
sample is the Kalenjin, whose members do not reside in large numbers in either of the
two recruitment neighborhoods.)
The Kikuyu and Luo ethnic rivalry has played an important role in Kenyan
politics for decades. After independence in the 1960’s, national politics was dominated
by the rivalry between Oginga Odinga (an ethnic Luo) and Jomo Kenyatta (a Kikuyu),
the country’s first president. The 2007 post-election violence ended once the two
presidential frontrunners Raila Odinga (a Luo and son of Oginga) and Mwai Kibaki (an
ethnic Kikuyu) reached a power-sharing agreement. In 2013, the sons of the two postindependence leaders were the frontrunners, with Raila Odinga losing to Uhuru
Kenyatta, the current president of Kenya.
There were two data collection rounds in our study, distinguished by their
proximity to the March 2013 presidential and parliamentary elections. We call the first
round from July to August 2012 the Non-Election round, and the second round from
January to February 2013 the Election round. The macroeconomic environment was
relatively stable during the study period, as captured in major commodity prices during
2011 to 2013 (see Appendix Figure S1). The total sample size is 1,362 distinct
These five groups make up roughly sixty percent of the national population, according to 2009 Kenyan
census data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS).

individuals, with 608 individuals in the Non-Election round and 754 in the Election
round. Participants were recruited in each round following an equivalent protocol.
Two lab sessions were held each day, each lasting two to three hours and
including up to 20 participants. As compensation, individuals were reimbursed for
transport and given a “show-up fee” (in addition to their payouts from the games
played). Payments took place by mobile money transfer after the session had ended. All
games were paid out, and results of each game were not revealed until after the session.
In order to minimize the probability that participants discovered each other's ethnicity,
they were asked not to talk to each other and they sat in separate cubicles once they
entered the lab premises. A discussion of the experimental lab protocol, including
details of recruitment, payment, and lab procedures is contained in Appendix C.
Figure 2 illustrates the structure of the lab activities. Each lab session was
divided into two parts, both chronologically and conceptually, featuring a part with
standard anonymous games followed by a part with “profiled” games, in which
individuals were provided some information about their partners.
In the standard part, participants were randomly paired with individuals about
whom they were provided no information. These partners were individuals who had
played in pilot lab rounds and were randomly chosen to receive payouts based on the
play of the games. Although participants had no way of knowing the specific ethnicities
of the partners they were paired with, they knew that they were recruited from
Nairobi’s multiethnic population. Hence, if they had reason to wonder about their
partners’ ethnic backgrounds, participants could reasonably infer that they were quite
unlikely to be coethnics; as we discuss below, the largest ethnic group in our sample
(Kikuyus) comprised just 32% of participants (Table 1).
In the profiled part of the lab, participants were paired with individuals about
whom they received three pieces of background information: their education, age, and
home region. The objective was to provide information with which a participant could
10

make an inference about her/his partner’s ethnic affiliation without being completely
overt about the focus of the experiment. The inclusion of information about the
partner’s age and education was meant to obscure the ethnic focus of the study; as we
discuss below, it appears to have been largely successful. For instance, one actual
profile was presented as follows: “This participant is originally from near Kisumu, went to
school up to Form 2 and was born in 1979.” Home region – here Kisumu, a city in the
western part of the country with an overwhelming Luo ethnic majority (84% in the 1999
national census) – is a strong indicator the participant’s ethnic background. Local
interviews have confirmed that the vast majority of Kenyans would conclude correctly
that this partner was an ethnic Luo. The order of the three pieces of information (home
region, school completion, and birth year) was varied across subjects so as to avoid bias
stemming from order effects.
The profiles of the other players with whom participants were paired were
randomly assigned. As in the standard games, the profiles were drawn from among the
individuals who participated in the pilot sessions, only this time we limited the partner
sample to those whose home regions provided unambiguous clues about their ethnicity.
To ensure a sufficiently large number of coethnic matches, we further limited the
partner sample to individuals from the two largest ethnic groups, the Kikuyu and the
Luo, groups whose high political relevance insures that many of the interactions we
study were between members of groups whose relations have been historically fraught.
As laid out in our pre-analysis plan (see appendix D), and in accordance with the
ethnic political coalitions that emerged in advance of the 2013 national election, we
choose to categorize Luos together with Luhyas and Kisiis (two other western Kenyan
groups long in coalition with Luos in national politics) as coethnics in the analysis, as
distinct from the larger Kikuyus. To be conservative, we pre-specified that the Kamba
would be excluded from the main analysis due to the shifting political alliances of their
leaders during 2012 and 2013 (but the results do not differ if they are included and
11

grouped with the Kikuyu, the group that is culturally and geographically closest to
them). The main empirical results are also unchanged if the sample is restricted to just
Kikuyu and Luo subjects alone, who together make up roughly half the sample,
ignoring allied ethnic groups, as we discuss below.
Each lab session consisted of three main games: the Dictator Game (DG), the
Public-good game (PG), and the Choose-Your-Dictator (CYD) game. Within the profiled
parts of the DG and PG, the order of the coethnic and non-coethnic games was
randomized. The CYD, by contrast, was always played with at least some partner
information, although there are two information variants to this game, described below.
In addition to the behavioral games, participants were exposed to a randomly
assigned priming treatment designed to increase the situational salience of (1) ethniccultural differences, (2) ethnic-political differences, (3) political competition, or (4)
national identity. There was also a control group in which participants were exposed to
a neutral prime. We hypothesize that the priming treatments might affect the degree of
ethnic preferences (qi) or egoism (bi), and thus affect coethnic bias in behavior.
The primes were designed to serve as experimental counterparts to the real
world variation in proximity to elections that we examine and, in the case of the
national identity prime, to explore the effects on ethnically motivated behavior of
invoking a common superordinate identity (Kramer and Brewer 1984, Gaertner and
Dovidio 2000). The political competition prime serves to provide experimental variation
in “exposure” to an election period. As such, we might expect this priming treatment to
identify the same mechanisms as we observe when comparing the 2012 Non-election
round data to the 2013 Election round. To the extent that ethnicity and politics are
tightly linked in subjects’ minds, priming them to ethnic identity may have a similar
impact. It may also have an effect independent of its political connections, simply by
alerting subjects to the salience of ethnic differences. The two types of ethnic primes are
meant to mimic the daily exposure that individuals have to appeals to shared ethnic
12

culture (the ethnic-cultural prime), and to blatant tribal politics (the ethnic-political
prime). The latter may operate by increasing perceptions of intergroup competition,
which may exacerbate individual level discrimination along group lines (Bowles and
Gintis 2004; Shayo 2009). We clearly are not mimicking (or attempting to mimic) hate
speech with the primes, but do hope to capture a similar degree of situational salience
as one would experience hearing bits of a politician’s speech or radio discussion.
To reduce the likelihood that priming effects would dissipate, priming was
implemented at four distinct points within the lab session (see Figure 2). The primes
were administered between each set of games as short, three question on-screen
quizzes. As an illustration, one of the political competition priming questions asked:
“How many political candidates are running for the Presidency?” One of the ethnic-cultural
priming questions was: “This greeting comes from which region: ‘Orie’?” Questions specific
to the priming conditions were inter-mixed with neutral questions, mainly focused on
Kenyan popular culture or everyday life in Nairobi, for example: “How often do you ride
a matatu (mini-bus) every week?” Each quiz included two priming questions and one
neutral question. Those in the control prime group were asked only neutral questions.
See Appendix C for the full set of priming questions.
We implemented a 16-piece Raven Progressive Matrices test at the start of each
lab session for a measure of individual cognitive ability (Raven 2008). We use these
scores both to confirm balance across treatment groups in this potentially important
characteristic and as a control in our analyses. We normalize the Raven’s test score in
our sample, resulting in a measure with mean zero and standard deviation of one.
At the end of the session, subjects were administered an IAT, and then asked
survey questions to capture self-reported political preferences and attitudes. The
questions gathered information on subjects’ preferences among the presidential
candidates in the upcoming election, their actual vote choice in the previous election,
their attitudes regarding the 2007 post-election violence, whether they had received
13

items or cash from political campaigns, and the number of political rallies they had
attended. We also asked the standard Afrobarometer question on the strength of
respondents’ ethnic attachment relative to other identity dimensions (Eifert et al. 2010).

We pre-specified our analytical approach in a pre-analysis plan registered in the
American Economic Association Social Science Registry (ID# AEARCTR-0000016).
The analysis described below closely follows the plan (see Appendix D). The past few
years have seen a rise in the use of pre-analysis plans for field experiments (Miguel et
al. 2014), but this study is to our knowledge among the first to apply this approach to a
laboratory experiment. A registered PAP helps address concerns of data-mining and
publication bias. These concerns are especially salient in our study given its complex
structure, with multiple games, primes, subsamples, and lab rounds, which allow for a
plethora of potential hypothesis tests.
There are several noteworthy aspects of our application of a pre-analysis plan in
this context. First, in direct response to critics who claim that pre-specification
undermines flexibility, we demonstrate that it is possible to reconcile the natural
evolution of research objectives over the course of a study with a commitment to prespecification. After analyzing the data from the 2012 Non-election round, we registered
a second PAP in anticipation of analyzing the Election round data, and it featured
several modifications, including an additional priming condition – namely, the ethnicpolitical prime, which more explicitly attempted to trigger the salience of ethnic politics
– as well as several econometric modifications. This approach of updating a preanalysis plan can be generalized to any study setting where new data becomes available
over time (for instance, in the case of ongoing longitudinal data collection) as long as
the registration of the plan precedes access to and analysis of the new data.

14

Second, we present a number of analyses that were not pre-specified, clearly
highlighting them for the reader. Important insights inevitably occur over the course of
a study, and not every piece of analysis can be predicted in advance, making it
important to maintain flexibility as long as there is full transparency about what was
and was not pre-specified. A reader preferring to disregard the non-prespecified
hypotheses is free to do so, but they are made available to others who may find them
useful. For instance, our discussion below of the differences in behavior between recent
migrants to Nairobi versus long-term residents was not prespecified but provides an
informative test of a key observable implication of one interpretation of our results.
Finally, as a check against the possibility that we are selectively emphasizing a
non-representative subset of results from among the universe of all tests in the PAP (as
provided in Appendix E), we also compare the distribution of p-values contained in the
main tables of this article with the distribution of p-values for all hypothesis tests
described in the plan. As there are hundreds of hypothesis tests described in the PAP, it
is not feasible to discuss all of them in a research paper of standard length. This
comparison allows us to assess whether we are disproportionately emphasizing (or deemphasizing) statistically significant results in the main study tables.
Coffman and Niederle (2015) have recently argued against the use of pre-analysis
plans for lab experiments, claiming that they are superfluous in settings where
experiments can be easily replicated. While we wholeheartedly endorse Coffman and
Niederle’s emphasis on replication, we view replication studies and pre-analysis plans
as complements rather than substitutes, and believe that our analysis, which relies on a
particular context (namely, proximity to the Kenyan elections), highlights some
important benefits of a pre-analysis plan. Since it is not possible to replicate our study of
the 2013 Election round effects in Kenya in the absence of a time-machine, substituting
replication for pre-specification is not an option. In such a context, pre-specifying our
hypothesis helps to bolster the credibility of the results. The same holds for the growing
15

number of scholars collecting lab experimental data in the context of a parallel field
experiment, or where the research design is linked in some way to a real-world natural
policy experiment or “shock” (Fisman et al. 2014, Michelitch 2015, among many others).
In cases where lab experimental researchers only have “one shot” at a particular type of
data – due to access, cost, or timing – pre-analysis plans can be a useful tool.
3.3.

Dictator Game

The Dictator game aims to capture an individual's altruism towards others. Participants
were given an endowment of 50 Ksh ($0.60) – equivalent to roughly an hour’s wage for
many Nairobi workers – of which they had to decide how much to give away to an
anonymous partner with whom they were randomly paired. Subjects played both
standard and profiled version of the game, with the latter played twice: once with a
coethnic partner once and once with a non-coethnic partner. This allows us to measure
the degree of coethnic bias in the behavior of each participant, as captured by the
difference in transfers to the coethnic versus non-coethnic partner.
The standard Dictator game was played in both the Election and Non-election
rounds but, due to a programming error in the lab software, only the coethnic version
of the profiled game was played in the Non-election round. This implies that we can
estimate the extent of ethnic bias in the Dictator game only in the Election round. (There
was no such coding error for the Public-good game or the Choose-Your-Dictator game,
so for those games we are able to measure coethnic bias in both the Non-election and
Election rounds, as described below.)
In the analysis, the outcome of interest is the percentage of the endowment
transferred to the partner. We first focus on how partner coethnicity affects transfers,
and how coethnicity interacts with election proximity, and then estimate the effect of
the priming treatments.
The first specification includes data from both the standard and profiled games:
16

𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶ℎ𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶ℎ𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝐸𝐸𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖

+𝛽𝛽4 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁ℎ𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(5)

Yij is the transfer (in percent of the endowment) by subject i to their partner in game j,

Coethnicij (Noncoethnicij) is an indicator variable for being paired with a coethnic (noncoethnic) partner in game j, Electioni indicates whether respondent i is observed in the
Election round, and ε ij is the error term, clustered by individual. The lack of a noncoethnic profiled Dictator game in the Non-Election round explains the missing noninteracted Noncoethnicij term. The estimate of coethnic bias in behavior in the Election
round is given by the difference in coefficient estimates on the coethnic partner and
non-coethnic terms, and the formal hypothesis test is that (𝛽𝛽1 + 𝛽𝛽3 ) = 𝛽𝛽4 . The Election

round effect captured in 𝛽𝛽2 is potentially of independent interest. As a robustness check,
we also estimate a specification with covariates including ethnicity and gender, years of
education, and the normalized Raven’s test score.
We estimate effects of the priming treatments in two slightly different ways. In
the main analysis that we report in the text, we focus on the standard Dictator game in
order to provide the cleanest possible test of priming effects. Since participants could
reasonably infer that anyone they were paired with was likely to be a non-coethnic, the
results of the standard Dictator game provides insight into the effects of priming on
levels of altruism vis-a-vis non-coethnics. We estimate the following equation:
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 + ∑3𝑘𝑘=1 𝛽𝛽1+𝑘𝑘 𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 + ∑4𝑘𝑘=1 𝛽𝛽4+𝑘𝑘 (𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 ∗ 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 ) + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(6)

The terms T1, T2, T3 and T4 are indicator variables for the four priming conditions,
namely, the political-competition prime, the ethnic-cultural prime, the national prime,
and the ethnic-political prime, respectively. β1 estimates the difference in the average
level of transfers across the Election and Non-election rounds, β2, β3, and β4, the average
effects of the first three priming treatments in the Non-election round, and β5, β6 and β7
17

the differential effect of these primes in the Election round. β8 is the effect of the ethnicpolitical prime, which was only administered in the Election round, and thus is only
included in interaction with the Election round indicator.
We also analyze the effects of priming using the profiled Dictator game. This
analysis provides an arguably more direct test of the impact of priming on ethnic bias,
but has the drawback of potentially cueing subjects, through both the priming and the
home district information provided in the profile, to the researchers’ interest in
ethnicity. Hence we put more weight on the priming analyses that employ the nonprofiled games. In any case, results are similar using both approaches (Appendix E).
3.4.

Public-good Game

Participants in the Public-good game were given an endowment of 60 Ksh ($0.70), and
could choose how much to keep for themselves versus how much to contribute to a
group fund in which contributions were multiplied by two before being equally shared
among the three players in the game. The contribution level thus captures an
individual's willingness to share resources to make others better off, and resembles the
classical prisoner’s-dilemma. Compared to the Dictator game, the Public-good game’s
framing in terms of a “group fund” is distinct, and the recognition that other actors are
also making decisions could trigger reciprocity that might affect behavior.
Before deciding how much to contribute themselves, subjects stated how much
they believed each of the other players would contribute. These were non-incentivized
elicitations. Subjects received no information about the two other players in the
standard part of the session, where once again the other players were randomly drawn
from subjects in the pilot rounds. In the second, profiled part of the lab, they were
informed about each of the two other players’ years of education, age and home region,
just as in the profiled Dictator game. There were two types of profiled Public-good
games. The first was a “mixed” group, with one coethnic player and one non-coethnic
18

player, and the second, the “coethnic” group, in which both players were coethnics with
the subject. The order in which these were played was randomized. The difference in
individual contributions to the group fund across the coethnic group and the mixed
group is a measure of coethnic bias. We pre-specified both a focus on contributions, as
well as on “contributions minus beliefs” in the PAP (see the discussion above). For
simplicity here, we focus on contributions alone but results are very similar for the
contributions minus beliefs outcomes (see Appendix E).
The main econometric specification follows the Dictator game, where Mixedij is
an indicator for an ethnically mixed group, Coethnicij is a homogeneous coethnic group,
and Yij is the contribution of individual i in game j, and all games (standard and
profiled) are pooled in the analysis:
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶ℎ𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖

+𝛽𝛽4 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶ℎ𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽5 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(7)

We estimate the extent of ethnic bias in the Non-election round in an F-test of the
hypothesis that 𝛽𝛽1 = 𝛽𝛽2 . We also assess if there is a differential degree of coethnic bias in
the Election round by testing if 𝛽𝛽4 = 𝛽𝛽5 . As in the Dictator game, we also estimate the

effects of the priming interventions in the standard Public-good game (see Appendix E).
3.5.

Choose-Your-Dictator Game

The Choose-Your-Dictator game was designed to capture expectations of differential
levels of altruism in coethnic and non-coethnic interactions by measuring whether
subjects discriminate along ethnic lines in their choice of a “leader” responsible for
allocating resources to them, a conception thus broadly linked with the process of

19

electing public officials. 6 We operationalize this by building on the Dictator games
employed in this study.
Subjects ("choosers") were presented with two randomly drawn profiles of
potential “Dictators”, and were then asked to choose one to be “their” Dictator in a
Dictator game. One of the two drawn profiles was a coethnic, the other a non-coethnic,
and as before these were the profiles of actual individuals who played in the pilot
rounds. As in the profiled Dictator and Public-good games, choosers were provided
with basic information about both of the potential Dictators’ years of education, age,
and birth region. Prior to choosing “their” Dictator, we also elicited the subject’s beliefs
about how much each of the Dictators they were choosing between would allocate to
them in the game (this is the source of the Dictator game beliefs data presented in
Figure 1, Panel B). The subject’s payoff in the game was the amount the selected
Dictator actually transferred when he or she played the game.
The Choose-Your-Dictator game was played twice. In the first, “standard”
version, choosers select a Dictator knowing that the potential Dictators do not have any
information about them, i.e., the payoff will be from the standard Dictator game played
by these Dictators. Through the lens of our model in section 2, this choice depends only
on expected differences in average generosity bi between the two potential Dictators,
but not on their coethnic bias. In the second, “profiled” version, the choosers select a
Dictator knowing that the Dictator will be provided with the choosers’ own basic
information profile (i.e., their years of education, age, and home region). The payoff
now is from the profiled Dictator game.7 In this second version of the game, where the
Adida et al (2015) develop a game similar to our ”Choose-Your-Dictator” game. Their experimental
protocol differs as the participants went through a face-to face speed-chatting process prior to voting for a
group “leader.” Hence the choice of “leader” could be affected by personal characteristics out of the
researchers’ control, and the impact of ethnicity may be more difficult to discern.
7 In practice, it was impossible to perfectly match all characteristics from our set of pilot profiles to each
and every subject in the actual lab sample, so the matching between the subject and the profile was done
on coethnic home region alone. Given that we do not find that the years of education or age in the profiles
6

20

Dictator has information about the likely ethnicity of the recipient, the chooser’s
selection depends on expected differences in biqi across the coethnic and non-coethnic
Dictators. The difference in play across the “standard” and the “profiled” versions of
the Choose-Your-Dictator game is of great conceptual interest for this study, as it helps
to isolate the expected coethnic bias term qi.
To understand the extent of respondent preferences for a coethnic “Dictator”, we
implement an ordered logit analytical specification. The dependent variable is Yip,
which takes on the following values for Dictator profiles p in the choice set of
respondent i: Yip = 0 if profile p is not chosen by the subject, equals 1 if the subject is
indifferent between profile p and the other profile in its choice set, and equals 2 if the
subject chooses profile p. The “indifferent” option was included after we piloted the
game and observed that large shares of participants claimed they were unable to choose
between potential Dictators based on the basic profile information alone, an early hint
about the low levels of coethnic bias in this population.
We specify the probabilities for observing each outcome value of Yip as a function of
Vip, which can be interpreted as respondent i’s latent utility for profile p (Woolridge
2001). Using this framework, we carry out maximum likelihood estimation. The main
specification estimates the difference between the valuation placed on a coethnic versus
a non-coethnic profile across the “standard” and the “profiled” versions of the ChooseYour-Dictator game:
𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑝𝑝 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶ℎ𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶ℎ𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶ℎ𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖

(8)

Here α p is the set of profile fixed effects, Coethnicip is an indicator variable for profile p
being coethnic of the subject, and Profiledip indicates whether the Dictator was playing
are significantly correlated with the choices of subjects faced with these profiles, we do not believe that
this “mismatch” of characteristics other than home region is consequential for the analysis.
21

the profiled version of the Dictator game, and thus had information about the subject’s
home region. In the Non-election round, 𝛽𝛽1 estimates the degree of coethnic preference

in the standard Choose-Your-Dictator game (equivalent to bi generosity in our model
above), and 𝛽𝛽2 is the additional degree of coethnic preference in the profiled Choose-

Your-Dictator game, which captures the degree of coethnic bias that the subject expects
from the Dictator, which is equivalent to their expectation of the qi coethnic preference

term in our model. Thus the estimate of 𝛽𝛽2 is of central interest. The 𝛽𝛽3 and 𝛽𝛽4 terms

capture any additional coethnic bias in the Election round. The error-term

has a

Type I Extreme-value distribution. As a robustness check, we also condition on subject
covariates, in this case interacted with the Coethnicip term (since explanatory variables
that do not vary across choice options cannot be estimated in a logit model).
3.6.

Implicit Association Tests (IATs)

A potential concern with our approach is that game behavior may be affected by the
desire of participants not to be seen to be discriminating along ethnic lines. We address
this issue in two ways.
First, we collected data to ascertain whether participants were aware of our
interest in ethnic discrimination. During piloting that we undertook before the start of
the main data collection, we asked subjects – both at the midpoint of the lab sessions
and at their conclusion – detailed questions regarding their understanding of the main
focus of the experiment. The most common response was that the experiment was
mainly about economic or business issues. Roughly equal numbers of subjects thought
it was mainly about education or about “tribe” (i.e., ethnic issues). The proportion who
believed that ethnic issues were a focus of the experiment rose slightly by the end of the
lab, perhaps due to the nature of the Choose-Your-Dictator game, the final game, which
asks participants to explicitly choose between two other players after being given
information about those players’ region of origin (among other characteristics), but still
22

remained less than a quarter of all subjects. We are therefore confident that the vast
majority of subjects did not understand the study’s core research aims during the
course of the labs; Appendix C contains further details.
In addition, we included an Implicit Association Test (IAT) as part of our main
lab protocols. The objective of the IAT is to capture implicit biases of which respondents
may not even be conscious. As such, the IAT results arguably allow us to avoid social
desirability bias and experimenter demand effects, both of which may affect game play
if subjects are sufficiently aware of the study hypotheses and/or socialized against
public displays of ethnic bias. This measure of implicit ethnic bias is complementary to
our measures of explicit ethnic bias in the behavioral games.
The test is premised upon theories of learning and representation in psychology,
and presumes that individuals find it easier to make the same behavioral response to
concepts that are “strongly associated,” i.e., about which they agree, than for concepts
that are weakly associated (Nosek et al. 2007). In our lab, we focused on the degree to
which respondents have a bias in favor of their own ethnic group. 8 Others have used
related IAT methodologies to assess ethnic bias in Africa (Lowes et al 2015), gender bias
in India (Beaman et al. 2009), and racial bias in the U.S. and elsewhere (Greenwald et al.
2003, Bertrand et al. 2005, Greenwald et al. 2009, Ogunnaike et al. 2010, Rooth 2010).
The IAT provides a measure of a respondent’s automatic associations with
certain Kenyan ethnic groups. Individuals were timed to assess how quickly they were
able to associate coethnics with “good” traits and non-coethnics with “bad” traits. This
is the “congruence” round of the IAT. In the “dissonance” round, coethnics are
associated with bad traits and non-coethnics with good ones. A faster response time for
congruence tasks compared to dissonance tasks implies that the subject has a more

We also carried out a parallel “national” IAT to capture the strength of feelings toward Kenya, and plan
to discuss those results in future studies (see Appendix E).

8

23

positive attitude toward coethnics (or a more negative attitude toward non-coethnics).
Examples of several “screen shots” from the IAT are provided in Appendix C.
The outcome measure for the IAT is the within-respondent normalized
difference in average reaction times (ART) between the dissonance (D) and congruence
(C) tasks, called the d-score for subject i: 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 =

𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝐷𝐷 −𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝐶𝐶
𝜎𝜎𝑖𝑖

, where 𝜎𝜎𝑖𝑖 is the standard

deviation of a respondent’s reaction times across all items. In keeping with the

literature, we interpret a higher d-score as indicating a stronger coethnic bias in
preferences in the ethnic IAT.
We first estimate the average level of ethnic bias in the IAT in the full sample.
The correspondence between these patterns and the extent of coethnic bias in the games
may shed light on the extent of experimenter demand effects in the games. We also
estimate the effect of the priming treatments on the ethnic IAT d-score.

Descriptive statistics

Descriptive statistics for the lab participants are presented in Table 1 (left column).
Females are slightly more than half the sample (at 60%), respondents are 33 years old on
average, and they have completed an average of 9.6 years of education, a schooling
level that is typical for young Kenyan adults in urban areas but higher than national
averages. In terms of employment, 29% of the sample report having a continuous
source of wage income, 13% report self-employment, and 30% are unemployed (not
shown). More than half of participants belong to the two largest ethnic groups, with
32% of the sample Kikuyu and 21% Luo, and the remainder from smaller groups.
Although not shown in the table, in Appendix B we present evidence that the
randomization across the various priming interventions created treatment groups with
similar observable characteristics along these dimensions.
24

Background data on subjects’ political attitudes and activities in the survey data
(collected at the end of the lab, Figure 2) corresponds closely to theories of ethnic-bloc
voting in Africa (Horowitz 1985), and confirms the political salience of ethnicity in this
sample. Approximately 84% of ethnic Luos report that they would support the coethnic
frontrunner Raila Odinga in the then upcoming 2013 elections, against only 8% of ethnic
Kikuyus, while 65% of Kikuyus state their support for Uhuru Kenyatta (versus just 1%
of Luos). Despite this polarization, the majority of respondents (63%) state that the 2007
post-election violence was not justifiable to any degree. Nearly 88% of individuals said
they intend to vote in the 2013 election, similar to official national voter turnout.9
4.2.

Estimating ethnic bias in preferences

As briefly mentioned in the introduction, there is no evidence for coethnic bias in either
the Dictator game or the Public-good game. We elaborate on this finding in this section.
Reproducing the result from Figure 1, the top row of Table 1 presents average transfers
in both games in the full sample. For both games the differences in average transfers are
small (35.6% to 35.4% in the Dictator game and 46.4% to 46.7% in the Public-good game,
for Coethnic versus Non-coethnic giving, respectively) and not statistically significant.
The regression results confirm the finding. Given the large number of hypotheses
we investigate, an important concern is the over-rejection of null hypotheses (“false
positives”) due to the problem of multiple inference (Anderson 2008). To mitigate this
risk, we present two types of p-values in our analyses: first the regular or “percomparison” p-value, which is appropriate when testing a single hypothesis, and
second, the FWER-adjusted p-value, which captures the likelihood that at least one true
null hypothesis is falsely rejected within a given set of hypotheses, using the free stepdown resampling method described in Westfall and Young (1993).

The lack of a Non-coethnic arm in the Non-election round lab implies that the
relevant test for coethnic bias in the Dictator game is the sum of the coefficient estimates
on the Coethnic terms in both rounds minus the coefficient estimate on the Noncoethnic term in the Election round. The average coefficient on bias is just 0.6
percentage points and not statistically significant (Table 2, columns 1-2, p-value = 0.67).
The large sample size implies that these are quite precisely estimated zeros: the 95%
confidence interval on the overall Coethnic effect in the Election round ranges from –2.2
to +3.4 percentage points. For those in the priming control group (i.e., who received no
priming to ethnic identity, political competition, or national identity), the effect is
slightly larger in magnitude but not significantly different from zero (column 3, p-value
= 0.48). In line with these findings, beliefs about the generosity of a coethnic Dictator are
nearly identical to beliefs about non-coethnic Dictators and not significantly different
from zero (Figure 1, Panel B, p-value = 0.51).
In the Public-good game, average coethnic bias in the Non-election round is
approximately 1.57 percentage points but this difference is not statistically significant
(Table 3, columns 1-2, p-value = 0.16). There is actually a significant reduction in
coethnic bias in the Election round of the Public-good game, with an average effect of 3.67 percentage points (p-value = 0.027), which runs counter to the existing evidence
that ethnic identity and preferences might become more salient closer to elections (Eifert
et al. 2010, Michelitch 2015). Taken together, the overall degree of coethnic bias in the
Election round is the sum of these two effects, and thus is small and negative (roughly 2 percentage points) and not statistically significant. In the priming control group, there
are no significant coethnic bias effects in either lab round (column 3).
Subjects believe groups members will be equally generous in coethnic and
ethnically mixed groups (Figure 1, Panel D), and results are unchanged when the
dependent variable is “contributions minus beliefs,” a measure of conscious free-riding
on the part of the subject (Appendix B), as proposed in Fischbacher and Gächter (2010).
26

Even if overall coethnic bias is close to zero, a natural question is the degree of
heterogeneity in the degree of this bias. This is illustrated in Table 1. The striking
pattern that emerges is how little variation there is along the various dimensions that
we pre-specified in the PAP. For instance, across both gender groups, the difference in
average transfers in the Dictator game to coethnics and non-coethnics is less than one
percentage point, and among subgroups defined by age, education, Ravens cognitive
score, and major ethnic groups, the differences are at most 1.2 percentage points. None
of these differences is statistically significant at traditional confidence levels. A similar
pattern holds for Public-good game contributions between coethnic and mixed groups,
with coethnic bias estimates of at most 1.9 percentage points for any subgroup. Again,
none of these differences are significant.
The evidence from the Dictator game and Public-good game are thus both
consistent with little to no coethnic preference in this population as a whole, as well as
for the major demographic subgroups. In terms of our model above, these patterns are
consistent with values of qi (coethnic bias in preferences) near zero for most subjects.
Appendix E contains further descriptive statistics and histograms, as well as tests
indicating that the null hypothesis of equality of the distributions of Coethnic and Noncoethnic transfers cannot be rejected in either game.
The Choose-Your-Dictator game also provides evidence on the degree of
coethnic bias, although this game does so by shedding light on subjects’ expectations
about how much coethnic bias they will experience at the hands of others. Recall that in
the standard Choose-Your-Dictator game, preference for a coethnic Dictator captures
beliefs about the Dictator’s likely generosity in general (the bi term in the model), while
the difference in preference for a coethnic Dictator in the standard versus the profiled
version sheds light on how much coethnic bias the subject expects from others (their qi).
The overall level of coethnic preference in the standard Choose-Your-Dictator
game is minimal, with 27% choosing a coethnic versus 22% a non-coethnic, and half
27

simply opting for “indifferent” in the Non-election round (Figure 3, left panel), and
nearly identical patterns in the Election round (right panel). While seemingly small in
magnitude, the effect is significant (Table 4, column 1) though not robust to the
inclusion of covariates or focusing on the priming control group (columns 2-3).
The more important test from the point of view of understanding coethnic bias is
the difference between these patterns and those that emerge in the profiled ChooseYour-Dictator game, the version in which the Dictator is given information about the
participant. In the profiled game, the proportion of subjects choosing a coethnic Dictator
rises slightly, to 32%, as does the proportion who choose a non-coethnic (25%) in the
Non-election round (Figure 3, left panel), and overall patterns of behavior in the
profiled game are also presented in the top row of Table 1. As discussed above, the
difference in behavior between the standard and profiled games is captured in the
coefficient estimate on the Profiled Game * Coethnic term, and this effect is small and
not statistically significant (Table 4, columns 1-3); taking into account the issue of
multiple hypothesis testing, the FWER adjusted p-value is close to one (at 0.993). Nor
does this effect emerge in the Election round (columns 1-3).
In other words, there is no evidence that subjects are more likely to choose a
coethnic Dictator when the Dictator has information about their home region (and thus
a way to make an inference about their ethnic background), relative to when the
Dictator does not have this information. This is consistent with the previous findings
since there is no evidence for coethnic bias in behavior in the Dictator game (Table 2).
Expectations and actions regarding coethnic bias are thus aligned among our subjects.
4.3.

Priming impacts

None of our priming treatments had a statistically significant effect on behavior in
either the standard Dictator game (Table 5, column 1) or the standard Public-good game

28

(column 4), and these effects did not differ significantly in the Election round (columns
2 and 5, respectively).
As noted, the ethnic-political prime was only included in the Election round.
This is because, after finding no effect of the ethnic-cultural prime in the 2012 Nonelection round, we hypothesized that this might be because our priming approach was
too subtle. Hence, we decided to introduce a more “blatant” ethnic priming treatment
in the Election round. In contrast to the ethnic-cultural prime, which sought to enhance
the salience of ethnic identity by emphasizing cultural aspects of ethnic identity, this
new treatment directly and overtly primed subjects to the link between ethnic identity
and political outcomes. For example, one of the questions asked: “Which of the following
ethnic groups controls the largest share of cabinet positions?” Yet this prime also has no
significant effect on transfers in either game (Table 5, columns 2 and 5).
There is also little evidence of priming effects in the profiled Dictator game,
Public-good game or Choose-Your-Dictator game; nor does the priming effect differ
across the Non-election and Election rounds (detailed results are in Appendix B, Tables
S1, S2, and S3; the full set of prespecified results are in Appendix E). Few of the relevant
differential priming effect estimates are statistically significant in the per-comparison
sense, and almost none survive the multiple testing adjustment.
The bottom line is that the priming interventions, which aimed to raise the
salience of ethnicity, political competition and national identity did little to change
behavior in the lab activities, including the degree of coethnic bias. We interpret this as
broadly consistent with the above findings regarding both the lack of a coethnic bias
effect in our sample and the absence of a difference in the extent of bias across the two
lab rounds. The results suggest that coethnic bias does not appear to lie “just below the
surface” in a way that might be triggered by priming subjects to ethnicity or political
competition. They also suggest that priming subjects to their membership in a
superordinate national identity does not affect their (already low) levels of ethnic bias.

Implicit association test (IAT) results

A final measure of coethnic bias can be gleaned from subjects’ behavior in the IAT. We
find a statistically significant and positive coethnic bias effect in this test, with a
magnitude of 0.079 standard deviation units (p-value < 0.01, Table 6, column 1). This
degree of bias is considered “small” in the related IAT research literature in psychology
(Cohen 1988). For instance, studies of racial bias in the United States – i.e., of the bias
whites holds against blacks – find estimates that are roughly six times as large, in the
range from 0.45 to 0.52 (Nosek et al. 2007), while the average gender bias regarding
political leadership in India is roughly twice as large, at 0.11 to 0.15 (Beaman et al. 2009).
Lowes et al (2015) report d-score values of 0.14 in a study of ethnic bias in rural Congo,
nearly twice as large as our estimates.
There is some evidence that the political competition priming treatment
increased ethnic bias in the IAT (Table 6, columns 3-4), which might be interpreted as
consistent with the findings in Eifert et al. (2010). However, this effect is only
marginally significant once multiple testing considerations are accounted for (column
5). None of the other priming interventions affected implicit ethnic bias. 10

Election proximity effects

While not the main focus of the study, we document an interesting set of patterns
regarding the effects of lab proximity to the 2013 Kenya elections. These tests were prespecified in the pre-analysis plans, so below we present p-values both in the typical percomparison sense, and in terms of FWER multiple testing adjustments.
Average transfers in the Dictator game are markedly lower in the Election round
compared to the Non-election round, with a difference of over 5 percentage points
(Appendix Figure S2, left panel). This difference is statistically significant (per-

Note that since the IATs were administered only in the Election round we are unable to assess whether
implicit ethnic bias is different in proximity to an election.

comparison p-value < 0.01, Table 2 columns 1-3), and also survives the multiple testing
adjustment (FWER p-value = 0.008, column 4). This is consistent with an increase in
egoism (bi) in the theoretical framework above.
Patterns are similar, although somewhat more muted, in the Public-good game,
with an average effect of roughly three percentage points (Appendix Figure S2, right
panel). This effect is significant at 90% confidence in the traditional sense (Table 3,
columns 1-3) but is not significant after FWER adjustment (p-value = 0.321, column 4).
Other scholars have documented that real-world economic conditions matter for
lab generosity (e.g., Fisman et al. 2014), and some scholars have argued specifically that
competitive environments might lead to a breakdown in adherence with cooperation
norms (Falk and Szech 2013, Michelitch 2015). However, we are unaware of other
research that documents systematically lower levels of generosity in election periods
compared to non-election periods. Further research would be useful to understand how
much this pattern generalizes across settings and elections.
Interpretation of this finding is less straightforward than many other results in
this paper since the Non-election round versus Election round comparison is not based
on experimental variation in the lab. At its base, this is a “time effect” between the two
lab rounds, and any other changes to the Kenyan setting, the study sample, or the
Busara lab space itself would contribute to effects, not just proximity to the election
alone. At best, then, this finding should be seen as provocative but not definitive.
With that in mind, there are several reasons to think that these round effects
might in fact be capturing an election proximity effect, at least in part. First, there were
no major economic “shocks” during the study period in terms of prices (see Appendix
Figure S1) or asset values, making it seem unlikely that a macroeconomic shock like that
studied in Fisman et al. (2014) is driving the result. In contrast, the political climate
changed dramatically between rounds: the survey we administered indicates that in the
Non-election round, just 25% (14%) of our subjects reported having recently attended a
31

campaign rally (received cash from a candidate), but this more than doubles to 61%
(31%) by the time of the January to February 2013 Election round.
The Busara Center also used comparable subject recruitment methods during our
2012 Non-election round and our 2013 Election round (and none of the subjects in the
Election round had participated in the earlier labs), which suggests that data is
comparable across rounds. Despite common recruitment practices, however, there are
some differences in the observed characteristics of lab subjects across the two rounds.
While the samples for the Non-election round and Election round are statistically
indistinguishable in terms of average age and education, they do differ significantly in
the share of females (which is higher in the Election round) and the average Ravens
score (lower in the Election round). The Election round sample also has a somewhat
smaller share of Kikuyus (see Appendix B, Table S4). Because of this partial imbalance
along observables across the lab rounds, we also estimated the main regressions
specifications including these individual demographic characteristics as covariates
(Table 2, column 2 and Table 3, column 2), and the estimated Election round effect
actually becomes somewhat larger. Yet it remains impossible for us to rule out that
selection of subjects along some unobservable dimension – for instance, their degree of
political activism, which could have affected their willingness to participate in a lab
activity rather than work on a political campaign – did differ across lab rounds, and this
calls for further caution in the interpretation of the Election round results.
4.6.

Assessing the presentation of results using the pre-analysis plan

Given the space constraints of a journal article, it was not possible to present every
result that was pre-specified in our pre-analysis plans. This raises the possibility that we
might have emphasized the subset of results that were more (or less) statistically
significant, or more consistent with our theoretical priors. One means – to our
knowledge, novel – of assessing whether we might have done this is to plot the
32

distribution of multiple testing FWER adjusted p-values presented in the paper’s main
tables (N=86 tests) together with the distribution of FWER adjusted p-values for all
hypothesis tests specified in the pre-analysis plans (N=763 in total).
We do this in Figure 4. The distributions are broadly similar, but the main study
tables do appear to slightly over-report statistically significant estimates (those with pvalues less than 0.05) for both the unadjusted p-values (Panel A) and the FWER
adjusted p-values (Panel B), and somewhat under-report those with p-values close to
one. Consistent with this visual inspection, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the
equality of these two distributions is rejected at 95% confidence for both the unadjusted
and the FWER adjusted p-values.
Of course, since the central implication of our empirical analysis is a null result,
namely, the lack of evidence for coethnic bias in preferences across multiple lab
experiments and measures, the slightly disproportionate emphasis on statistically
significant results apparent in Figure 4 does not appear to be driving our main
conclusions. Rather we think it likely reflects our reporting of the Election round results
discussed above, which feature in Tables 2, 3, and 5, and our decision to relegate a large
number of null priming treatment estimates and interaction effects to the appendix.

Conclusion

It is well-documented that ethnic differences are associated with negative outcomes in
many settings, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using a
large sample of over 1,300 participants and a rich set of experimental methods and
measures in a Kenyan setting in which ethnic divisions are thought to be particularly
important, we find little evidence of ethnically biased behavior or preferences.
These findings challenge the conventional wisdom about the centrality of ethnic
preferences in explanations for the negative association between ethnic diversity and
economic and political outcomes in Africa. They suggest that other factors—such as
33

technologies that facilitate cooperation or the enforcement of norms within ethnic
groups—may be even more important than has previously been thought. A key
implication is that efforts to dampen ethnic divisions by changing ethnic attitudes may
not be enough. Rather, institutional and policy reforms that facilitate the flow of
information across groups and limit the ability of elites to mobilize the population along
ethnic lines may prove more effective in ameliorating politicized social divisions.
Our findings are in apparent tension with the results of Hjort’s (2014) important
recent study of ethnic bias that also uses Kenyan data. Hjort takes advantage of the
random assignment of workers to teams on a flower farm to study whether within-team
productivity is lower when those teams are ethnically diverse. He finds that it is, and
argues that this is due to discrimination by team members on behalf of coethnics. Hjort
shows that this diversity effect is magnified after the 2007-08 election violence.
There are several possible ways to account for the differences between these
findings and our own. The most immediate is that, although ethnic preferences may
play a role, the negative diversity effects in Hjort may be caused in part by other
mechanisms. For example, the fact that Hjort shows that modifications in contractual
details—namely, moving to group-based pay on work teams—mitigates much of the
negative effect suggests that institutional factors are critical. Hjort’s design also makes it
hard to rule out the possibility that shared ethnicity provides a technology that
facilitates team production. A strength of our laboratory approach is that it allows us to
focus exclusively on the preferences mechanism and rule out alternative channels.
It is also important to note that while political tensions around the 2007 elections
(and in their aftermath) were extremely high, the 2013 national elections were
conducted in a much more peaceful atmosphere. This was in part due to measures
taken by the Kenyan government and political candidates, as well as to the efforts of
non-governmental actors to emphasize the importance of avoiding intergroup violence.
Hence the expectation that our period of study would be one of particularly high ethnic
34

tensions – and, by implication, that we would find high levels of ethnic bias in the lab
round proximate to the elections – may have been somewhat misplaced.
Another possible source of the discordant findings with Hjort’s (2014) study lies
in differences in our samples. Both Hjort’s sample and ours feature many of the same
ethnic groups and wide range of young and middle-aged adults, so those characteristics
are unlikely to explain differences. But it remains possible that ethnic bias is simply
stronger in his rural agricultural setting than in our urban sample.
Given the strictly urban nature of our subject pool, our study is not particularly
well suited to fully assessing this possibility. However, we are able to make some
progress by comparing the behavior in our sample of subjects who were long-time
Nairobi residents with the behavior of those who had moved to the city relatively
recently. While only suggestive, this is a meaningful test to the extent that individuals
gradually assimilate to local norms over time, such that those who have moved to
Nairobi relatively recently have preferences more similar to those who remain in rural
areas. Such an interpretation is consistent with research that finds that migrants
gradually adapt their social preferences and behaviors over time to the norms in their
new location (Henrich et al. 2006, Jang and Lynham 2015, Laitin 1998).
This analysis was not specified in our pre-analysis plan, and is thus more
speculative than our other empirical results. While we would ideally focus on those
individuals who had just moved to the city, there are relatively few such individuals in
our lab sample: just 2 percent had lived in Nairobi for less than one year. However, a
sizeable proportion had moved to Nairobi within 5 years (roughly 20% of subjects) and
even more in the last 10 years (40%). We examine the behavior of this latter group in
comparison with that of longer-term urban residents. Consistent with the hypothesis
that there might be an important urban-rural divide when it comes to ethnic
preferences, we find statistically significant differences in behavior between long-term
Nairobi residents and more recent arrivals. While individuals who have resided in
35

Nairobi for more than a decade exhibit no evidence of coethnic bias in their behavior,
more recent migrants are significantly more generous toward their coethnics in the
Election round for the profiled Dictator game, giving an average of 4.2 percentage
points (standard error 1.8) more to coethnics. Coethnic bias in the Dictator game is even
larger among those who had resided in Nairobi for at most 5 years, with an average
increase of 6.2 percentage points (standard error 2.4).
Thus migrants from rural settings appear to gradually assimilate to a new set of
norms regarding interethnic cooperation and ethnic preferences over time, perhaps in
part due to the far more extensive interactions they have with non-coethnics in Kenya’s
cosmopolitan capital. Further evidence comes from our political attitudes survey, which
shows rising ethnic identification (relative to other dimensions of individual identity) in
the 2013 Election round among those who have lived in Nairobi for less than 10 years
(coefficient estimate 8 percentage points, significant at 90% confidence) but not among
longer-term Nairobi residents.
Obviously, these findings cannot be taken as causal for many reasons, including
the fact that we lack rural lab participants. We also cannot rule out that the differences
mentioned above are driven by selective urban migration patterns over time rather than
the true effect of the length of urban residency, and furthermore, as noted, these
analyses were not pre-specified. Nevertheless, the suggestion that ethnic preferences
may be weaker in urban than in rural settings is provocative—in part because it would
call for a reevaluation of the well-known variant of modernization theory that posits a
positive relationship between urbanization and ethnic divisions (e.g., Bates 1983).
The possibility that ethnic preferences in contemporary Africa might indeed be
weaker in urban areas does find at least some support in the empirical literature.
Habyarimana et al (2007, 2009) also find no evidence of ethnic bias in the Dictator and
Public-good games played in Kampala, Uganda (an urban setting similar to the one we
study). Lowes et al (2015), meanwhile, do find evidence of ethnic bias in the IAT in a
36

rural sample in Congo. In a cross-national Afrobarometer sample, Robinson (2014) finds
that urban dwellers are more likely than their rural counterparts to privilege their
national identity over their ethnic identity—a result one step removed from, but
consistent with, weaker ethnic preferences in urban areas.
More is at stake here than simply helping to reconcile seemingly disparate
findings in our study versus Hjort (2014) and other recent literature. Our suggestive
findings also provide new insight into the future trajectory of ethnic preferences and
identification in Sub-Saharan Africa, given the rapid urbanization taking place in many
countries and the growing cross-ethnic interactions that accompany it. Other scholars
have pointed to the role that expanding democratization may play in dampening ethnic
favoritism (Burgess et al. 2015). Gaining a better understanding of the role played by
rapid urbanization, as well as by the major institutional reforms accompanying
democracy, will be an important goal for future scholarship on African ethnic divisions.

Dictator game. In the profiled CYD game, the Dictator had some information about the chooser, as in the profiled Dictator game in the lab. The
chooser had profile information about the Dictator for both versions of the CYD game. The Kenya Non-Election round took place in July/August
2012, and the Kenya Election round took place in January/February 2013. Choosers could opt for a coethnic Dictator, a non-coethnic Dictator, or
could state their indifference between the two, in which case they were randomly assigned one of the two Dictators.

Figure 4: Distribution of P-values in Pre-Analysis Plans versus Main Tables
Panel A: Unadjusted p-values

Panel B: FWER adjusted p-values

Notes: The distribution of p-values from the pre-analysis plan includes p-values for all hypothesis tests discussed in both pre-analysis plans (Nonelection round, Election round). The distribution of p-values from the main tables includes all tables (Tables 1 through 6) in this article. The dark
vertical line denotes statistical significance at the standard 95% confidence level. Panel A presents p-values unadjusted for multiple testing. Panel
B presents FWER adjusted p-values. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests on the equality of the two distributions yields a p-value of 0.014 in Panel A, and
0.005 in Panel B.

Table 1: Descriptive Statistics on the Sample and Average Game Play

Notes: Pooled data from the Non-Election Round (July-August 2012) and Election Round (January-February 2013). Values are averages, presented
in percent terms. For the Dictator game, only the Election Round averages are displayed, as there is incomplete information for the profiled
version of the Dictator game in the Non-election Round. Respondents with Kamba ethnicity are excluded from analysis, as pre-specified in the
pre-analysis plan.

Table 2: Dictator Game Transfers, in Standard and Profiled Games

Notes: The dependent variable is the transfer in the Dictator game (in percent of the endowment). Pooled data from the Non-election Round (JulyAugust 2012) and Election Round (January-February 2013). Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the individual level. P-values: * p<0.10,
** p<0.05, *** p<0.01. Covariates include ethnicity indicators, a gender indicator, education controls, and the Raven's test score. FWER p-values are
simulated as described in the pre-analysis plan, for column (3). There was no Non-coethnic profile in the Dictator game during the Non-election
Round, hence the absence of a direct "Non-Coethnic Recipient" term. The F-test in the bottom row tests the hypothesis that the average level of
coethnic bias in the Election round was zero. Each individual was endowed with 50 Ksh (approx. 0.60 USD). All specifications exclude ethnic
Kamba subjects, as specified in the pre-analysis plan.

Table 3: Public-good Game Contributions, in Standard and Profiled Games

Notes: The dependent variable is the contribution in the Public-good game (in percent of the endowment). Pooled data from the Non-election
Round (July-August 2012) and Election Round (January-February 2013). Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the individual level. Pvalues: * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01. Covariates include ethnicity indicators, a gender indicator, education controls, and the Raven's test score.
FWER p-values are simulated as described in the pre-analysis plan, for column (3). Each individual was endowed with 60 Ksh (approx. 0.70
USD). The first F-test tests the hypothesis that the average level of coethnic bias across both the Non-election round and the Election round is zero,
and the second F-test tests the hypothesis that the difference in coethnic bias across the Non-election round and the Election round is zero. All
specifications exclude ethnic Kamba subjects, as specified in the pre-analysis plan.

Table 4: Choose-Your-Dictator Game Choices, in Standard and Profiled Games

Notes: Ordered Logit specification, with dependent variable 0=not chosen, 1=indifferent, 2=chosen. Pooled data from the Non-election Round
(July-August 2012) and Election Round (January-February 2013). The sample contains 981 individuals. Standard errors in parentheses are
clustered at the individual level. P-values: * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01. All specifications include fixed effects for each Dictator-profile (12 profiles
in total). Covariates include interaction terms of the “Coethnic Profile” indicator with a gender indicator, education controls, and the Raven's test
score. FWER p-values are simulated as described in the pre-analysis plan, for column (3). All specifications exclude ethnic Kamba subjects, as
specified in the pre-analysis plan.

Table 5: Priming Effects in the Standard Dictator Game and Public-good Game

Notes: The dependent variables are the transfer in the Dictator game (in percent of the endowment) in columns 1-2, and the contribution in the
Public-good game (in percent of the endowment) in columns 4-5. Pooled data from the Non-election Round (July-August 2012) and Election
Round (January-February 2013). Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the individual level. P-values: * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01. FWER
p-values are simulated as described in the pre-analysis plan, for columns 2 and 5. The Ethnic-Political priming, which was only implemented in
the Election Round, is not included in columns 1 and 4. Each individual was endowed with 50 Ksh (approx. 0.60 USD) in the Dictator game, and
with 60 Ksh (approx. 0.70 USD) in the Public-good game. All specifications exclude ethnic Kamba subjects, as specified in the pre-analysis plan.

Table 6: Coethnic Bias in the Implicit Association Test (IAT)

Notes: The dependent variable is the D-score, namely, the difference (in standard deviation units normalized by respondent) between the average
response times in the Dissonance and Congruence IAT rounds. Data from the Election Round (January-February 2013). P-values: * p<0.10, **
p<0.05, *** p<0.01. FWER p-values are simulated as described in the pre-analysis plan, for column (3). Order Controls are indicators for the
randomized order of (i) the ethnic and national IAT, and (ii) the Dissonance and Congruence rounds within each IAT; columns 1 and 2 also adjust
for the different sampling weights of these randomized IAT order-groups. Covariates include ethnicity indicators, a gender indicator, education
controls, and the Raven's test score. All specifications exclude ethnic Kamba subjects, as specified in the pre-analysis plan. Slow-response
observations are excluded, as specified in the pre-analysis plan.
