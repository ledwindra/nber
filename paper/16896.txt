ABSTRACT
The headline numbers appear to show that even as banks and financial intermediaries suffered large
credit losses in the financial crisis of 2007-09, they raised substantial amounts of new capital, both
from private investors and through government-funded capital injections. However, on closer inspection
the composition of bank capital shifted radically from one based on common equity to that based on
debt-like hybrid claims such as preferred equity and subordinated debt. The erosion of common equity
was exacerbated by large scale payments of dividends, in spite of widely anticipated credit losses.
Dividend payments represent a transfer from creditors (and potentially taxpayers) to equity holders
in violation of the priority of debt over equity. The dwindling pool of common equity in the banking
system may have been one reason for the continued reluctance by banks to lend over this period. We
draw conclusions on how capital regulation may be reformed in light of our findings.

Introduction
Financial intermediaries were at the center of the financial crisis that began in August
2007. They bore the lion’s share of the credit losses from securitized subprime
mortgages, even though securitization was intended to parcel out and disperse credit risk
to investors who were better able to absorb losses. 3 The capacity to lend suffered as
intermediaries attempted to curtail their exposure to a level that could more comfortably
be supported by their capital. 4
The accumulated losses in the crisis were large, but so were the headline figures for the
amount of new capital raised. Table 1 and Figure 1 illustrate this “catching up” of capital
with losses incurred (all figures and tables are gathered together at the end of the paper).
The cumulative acknowledged credit losses for financial institutions worldwide since the
beginning of the financial crisis in August 2007 to the end of 2009 were $1.73 trillion.
Set against this, the headline figure for new capital raised was $1.45 trillion. On the
surface, the new capital raised is substantial, almost matching the losses. We see from
Table 1 that there are some regional variations, with new capital raised in Europe being
smaller relative to losses when compared to the United States. Although a substantial
amount of new capital raised worldwide was in the final quarter of 2008 as part of
government-funded recapitalization of the banking sector, the raw numbers seem
impressive.
However, a closer look at the numbers reveals a much less sanguine picture of the
recapitalization by the banking sector. We highlight three features in particular that are
worthy of closer scrutiny.
First, the composition of bank capital has changed, with most of the new capital being
raised in the form of debt or hybrid claims such as preferred equity. When leverage is
measured as the ratio of total assets to common equity, the leverage of the banking sector
in the US and Europe rose relentlessly during the crisis, as we will show below. We
argue that the continued reluctance of banks to lend may be attributable (at least in part)
to the high leverage of the banking sector.
Second, even as the banking system suffered the depletion of common equity through
losses on the asset portfolio, banks continued to pay dividends throughout the crisis. As
we will show, the outflow of common equity in the form of dividends was substantial in

In some cases, this appears to have been by design, e.g., in structured investment vehicles (SIVs) and
asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits, where banks sold guarantees to securitization vehicles to
game capital requirements. See Acharya, Schnabl and Suarez (2009) for detailed evidence of such
“securitization without risk transfer”. In other cases, it appears to have been a highly levered bet on the
economy, e.g., as manifested in the holdings of AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities which banks held
up to 39% of all such securities (Lehman Brothers Report, April 2008).

collapse, banks have made very few new loans and primarily honored drawdown on pre-arranged lines of
credit.

relation to total assets and total credit losses. This outflow deprived the banking system
of much-needed common equity capital precisely when it was most needed. This erosion
of common equity through dividends points to the breakdown of the priority of debt over
equity. Banks that ultimately received public funding support and were in serious risk of
failure continued to pay out dividends right from the period leading up to the crisis until
the period after Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy. For a bank whose losses can be
anticipated, it can be argued that dividends were paid to equity holders at the expense of
the debt holders (including the taxpayers who fund bailouts). This represents a straight
transfer in violation of the priority of debt over equity, which is sustained because of the
slow-moving nature of the deterioration of book equity. In effect, the inertia in bank
accounting makes even a distressed bank appear healthy in terms of its book capital
ratios, enabling a transfer in violation of priority of debt over equity. The undesirable
nature of dividend payments during crises has been commented on by Scharfstein and
Stein (Scharfstein and Stein (2008)). See also Wessel, David (2008) 5.
Third, but not least, as common equity is paid out on the liabilities side of the balance
sheet, the assets that get depleted on the asset side are the safe marketable assets –
especially cash or government bond holdings. What gets left behind are the illiquid,
riskier assets. This implies a type of risk-shifting or asset substitution that further favors
the equity holders over the debt holders for the usual reason that equity holders’ claims
are convex claims over the asset payoffs, while debt holders have concave payoffs.
Whereas traditionally risk-shifting has been discussed mainly in the context of new
investments (as in the seminal work of Jensen and Meckling, 1976), we can see that riskshifting can also be accomplished through changes in the capital structure of the bank.
Paying out dividends in cash leaves behind riskier assets on a thinner equity cushion,
which benefits the shareholders once again, at the expense of the debt holders.
On a related point, since many of the equity holders are also employees of the bank, the
diversion of funds from debt holders (including taxpayers) to equity holders is related to
the thorny and politically charged issue of employee compensation in banks. In this
sense, our paper can be seen as a contribution pointing out how the determination of bank
capital structure and dividend policy can be seen as a part of the larger debate on
compensation issues. The standard view on corporate governance that emphasizes
shareholder value maximization may have unintended and adverse consequences for
failing banks.
Our paper is primarily a descriptive study documenting in a comprehensive way the time
profile of losses and amount and type of new capital raised by banks in recent years, and
especially since the beginning of the current financial crisis. Although our study is by
design a “fact-finding” study, we believe that it contributes on two fronts. First, the facts

themselves are striking, and we have attempted to present the evidence in a unified way
that conveys the big picture. More importantly, the facts uncovered can help to inform
the way that banks took decisions in the current crisis, and thereby the future reform of
the rules governing bank regulation.
In particular, we believe that the dwindling pool of common equity may be an important
reason for the reluctance of banks to extend credit in spite of the large-scale injection of
bailout capital. Most of the public injections of bank capital in the United States through
the TARP program took the form of preferred equity rather than common equity (even
though in some cases, preferred equity is ultimately converted to common equity). As a
consequence, banks’ leverage relative to common equity has increased relentlessly. To
the extent that the common equity cushion was subject to increasing compression, the
stake of the controlling equity holders shrunk in accordance. This has led banks to take
an extremely conservative attitude toward taking up the slack in intermediation left by the
collapse of the securitization market as they would rather wait for the fortunes of their
beleaguered assets and thinly capitalized balance sheets to resurrect themselves than
extinguish that option for lower risk loans (see also Diamond and Rajan (2009) for a
related theoretical point).
A speech by Bill Dudley (2009), the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
notes that executives at banks and government-sponsored enterprises told regulators
“repeatedly over the past 18 months” that “now is not a good time to raise capital”. He
goes on to say:
“This desire to postpone capital raising stems in part to the fact that
bank executives often do not want to dilute existing shareholders,
which of course include themselves. […] The self-interested thing to do
is avoid the dilution and hope for a good state of the world.”
The fear of dilution leads incumbent shareholders to under-invest in raising new common
equity capital, an agency problem that is a variant of the Myers (1977) debt overhang
problem (again, not in the context of new investments). 6 This juxtaposition of agency
problems at failing banks – underinvestment in issuance of new capital and erosion of
existing capital through dividend distributions – poses some of the most difficult
questions for bank resolution policy.
This divergence in the interests of the incumbent controlling shareholders from the
broader public interest also raises questions on what should be the proper notion of
regulatory capital. Under the current system of bank regulation, capital is regarded as a
buffer against loss for senior creditors, and especially retail depositors. Hence, under the
current system, regulatory capital includes subordinated debt and preferred equity. The
recent crisis has led to a serious re-think on whether such hybrid claims should qualify as

6

Some others, see for example Tucker (2008), argue that the reluctance may be due to banks wanting to
avoid sending an adverse signal to markets and suffering dilution due to lemon’s premium (as in the Myers
and Majluf, 1984, model of costly equity issuance).

part of regulatory capital. Indeed, the recently agreed Basel III rules on capital put a
much greater emphasis on common equity. In future, regulators may have no choice but
to employ intervention thresholds that are tied to market value of equity – since that is
what affects decisions of bank management – and market-imposed leverage constraints
such as the extent of repo haircuts faced by a financial institution in the market for
borrowing.
Before we discuss these policy implications, we provide descriptive evidence on capital
raised by 23 large banks in the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe, and
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government sponsored enterprises in the United
States, focusing especially on the type of capital issued, and on the dividend policies and
capital structure of these banks, in the period 2000-2009 6.
Evidence on Bank Capital and Dividends
Table 2a shows the total capital raised by each bank/GSE in the pre-crisis period of 2000
to 2006 by the type of capital – common equity, preferred equity or debt. For the period
preceding the crisis, a total of $1.39 trillion of capital was issued by the 25 large financial
firms in our sample. A staggering $1.41 trillion of the total capital issued – that is,
101.2% - was in fact raised in the form of debt. Preferred equity accounted for $46.3
billion (3.34%). Capital outflow to common shareholders was at $63 billion (4.54% of
capital). Thus, essentially during the period 2000-2006 these financial firms raised
capital in the form of debt and to a lesser extent preferred equity.
During the crisis period of 2007-2009 the large financial firms raised nearly $707.6
billion of capital. The proportion raised as debt was 29.1% of total capital and accounted
for $205.8 billion of the total. Common equity share at $238.1 billion accounted for
33.7% of capital. In contrast to pre-crisis trends, more than 36.8% ($309.9 billion) of
capital was issued in the form of preferred debt. During this period, the 25 large financial
firms of the US, the UK and Europe, had negative common equity issuance – that is,
more of share buyback than share issuance – of $4.02 billion. This pattern is remarkable
since this was a period over which bank balance sheets grew significantly, so it must be
that as documented by Adrian and Shin (2008), this growth was funded close to one for
one by a combination of debt and preferred equity.
Figure 2a plots this division of capital issued into security type for individual banks for
the period preceding the crisis from 2000 to 2007. There are some differences that stand
out. While JP Morgan, the relatively better performer during the crisis, issued debt in
quantity that was 6.12 times common equity issued, in case of Lehman Brothers this ratio
was 72.17. Similarly, Citigroup had a high debt to equity ratio of 21.59. Of note
Wachovia, Wells Fargo, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America,

Complete details are provided in the Appendix. Appendices A and B describe the variables we employ
and their sources and the frequency of their measurement. Appendix C lists for each of the 21 banks the
exact nature of each individual capital issuance from 2007 - 2009.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had negative debt to equity ratios representing a capital
outflow to common equity holders. HBOS, one of the beleaguered UK bank during the
crisis, had a debt to common equity ratio of 10.17. Even with the benefit of hindsight,
the relationship between type of capital issued and the ex post performance of banks is
hard to ignore.
Figure 2c shows the TARP funds received by banks and the total amount paid back to
date (July 2010). The figure shows some striking results. In the 2007-2009 period, all the
banks (excluding the GSEs) which had received TARP funding had paid at least 45% of
the amount as dividends in 2007-20009. JP Morgan, had paid out $12 billion dollars,
almost half of the TARP funds it eventually received from the government. Similarly
Bank of America and Citigroup which received $45 billion each in TARP funds had paid
out $21 billion and $17 billion respectively in 2007-2009.
Tables 3a, 3b, 4a and 4b (and corresponding Figures 4a and 4b) show that the evidence
thus far masks one important fact – that banks had in fact been paying out significant
dividends, not just during 2000-2006 but also during the crisis period of 2007-2009.
Bank dividend payouts measured as a percentage of assets in 2002 were at 0.26% and in
2008 during the peak of the crisis, dividend levels fell to 0.17%. This ratio fell in 2009 to
0.05%. In effect, bank management did not drastically reduce their dividends in the first
twelve months of the worst crisis to have hit them.
Table 4 gives the dividends paid by the 25 financial firms since the outbreak of the
financial crisis in the summer of 2007. The largest dividends were paid by Bank of
America and Citigroup, with their dividends showing no slowdown until Q308. While
dividend payments slowed for both banks from 4Q08 to 4Q09, Bank of America
continued to payout dividends till the end of 4Q09. Citigroup on the other hand cut its
dividends only in 4Q08 and paid zero dividends from 2Q09 to 4Q09. Merrill Lynch
almost doubled its dividends in 4Q08 (to $699 million) compared to the year earlier in
4Q07 ($361 million). Similarly, Lehman increased its dividends from $95 million in
2Q08 to $118 million in 3Q08 right before it went bankrupt. Bear Stearns also increased
dividends from $36 million in 4Q07 to $47 million in 1Q08. Of particular note, Goldman
Sachs continued to pay dividends until the end of 2009. Goldman Sachs increased
dividends from $639 million in 2007 to $642 million in 2008 and to $717 million in
2009. On the other hand, while Morgan Stanley cut its dividends to zero in 1Q09, it
resumed dividends beginning 2Q09. However, 2Q09 dividends were at only $80 million
(only 28% of dividends in 2Q08).
In contrast to investment banks, Wachovia and Washington Mutual cut their dividends
drastically in the quarters leading up to their failure. Wachovia cut its dividends from
$808 million in 2Q08 to $108 million in 3Q08. Similarly, Washington Mutual cut its
dividends from $130 million in 1Q08 to $10 million in 2Q08. Similarly the GSEs Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac cut their dividends to zero in 4Q08 and 3Q08 respectively.
Table 5 gives the quarterly losses incurred by the financial firms in our analysis. This
table highlights the fact that these financial firms were struggling during this period and
7

yet continued to pay out dividends as described above. Particularly, Lehman which
increased dividends in 3Q08 posted losses of $5.3 billion in 2Q08 and $7.0 billion in
3Q08 before filing for bankruptcy. Bear Stearns which increased dividends in 1Q08
posted losses of $1.9 billion in Q407 and $0.6 in Q108. Fannie and Freddie posted losses
of $138.7 billion and $115.1 billion for the period from 3Q07 to 4Q09. Wachovia which
cut dividends in 3Q08 reported $29.4 billion in losses, a jump of 124% from $13.1 billion
losses the previous quarter. Similarly Wamu which cut dividends in 2Q08 and 3Q08
reported losses of $5.5 billion in 2Q08 and $30.9 billion in 3Q08.
Lessons from private contracting
Anecdotal evidence is consistent with a reluctance of banks to cut dividends or even
reduce their amount: 7 Lehman Brothers Holdings announced a 13% increase in its
dividend and a $100 million share repurchase in January 2008; Citigroup cut its dividend
close to zero only in November 2009; JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, while recipients of the
TARP capital in Fall 2008 cut dividends as late as February and March 2009,
respectively; and even as the Federal Reserve was urging banks receiving bailout funds to
cut dividends, Goldman Sachs did not cut dividends throughout the crisis period.
This is to be compared to the fact that 61 components of the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock
index cut their dividends during 2008. Most corporate debt has covenants which prevent
banks from paying out dividends when negative earnings are reported. This constraint
prevents firms from transfer of funds to equity holders at the expense of debt holders.
Additionally, firms cut dividends to avoid the debt overhang problem (Myers (1977)). A
debt overhang emerges if a company is unable to make new investments since it is unable
to raise new debt as lenders are unwilling to lend to highly levered firms. Firms
anticipating such opportunities maintain an equity cushion and thus cut dividends in
times of distress.
In contrast, banks have continued to pay out dividends even during the crisis. This can be
attributed to the short-term nature of their funding and the implicit and explicit
guarantees provided by the government. Banks are typically funded by short-term debt.
As a result, if they were to announce a dividend cut, rollover debt can “run” as it did on
investment banks. The fear of “runs” leads banks to continue paying dividends even
when it would be prudent for them in the long-run to cut dividends.
Further banks benefit from the explicit and implicit guarantees provided by the
government. The explicit government guarantees provided on deposits for commercial

banks ensures that the banks are protected even in the event of a failure. Similarly, many
financial institutions may have the implicit government guarantee for firms which are
considered too-big-to-fail. Thus, banks are unlikely to cut dividends, figuring that in the
event that they do fail, they would most likely be bailed out.
The contrast between stressed depository institutions (such as Wachovia and Wamu) and
investment banks (such as Lehman, Merrill Lynch) is already informative. While
depositories were subject to a “prompt corrective action” resolution regime, such orderly
wind-down plans were absent for investment banks. Hence, the implicit too-big-to- fail
guarantee for investment banks was virtually free of any end-game restrictions, allowing
them to pay dividends even as they were failing.
This contrasting behavior of banks versus non-financial firms provides important lessons
for reform of governing bank regulation. Regulators have realized that banks need to be
explicitly prevented from paying out dividends in times of distress to avoid such transfers
in violation of priority of debt over equity. As Lawrence Summers, Director of the
National Economic Council notes in his letter on the Senate and House of Representative
(January 12, 2009):
“Those receiving exceptional assistance will be subject to tough but
sensible conditions that limit executive compensation until taxpayer
money is paid back, ban dividend payments beyond de minimis
amounts, and put limits on stock buybacks and the acquisition of
already financed strong companies”
The evidence suggests that such restrictions provide better incentives for banks to behave
more like non-financial firms in the event of a crisis. In later sections, we further draw
on the lessons learnt from private contracting and provide recommendations for the
design of prompt corrective measures for governing bank regulation.
Two Notions of Capital
To understand the significance of common equity and its role in bank resolution, it is
important to distinguish between two different notions of bank capital. There is, first, the
notion of bank capital (implicit in the Basel approach) as a buffer against loss that
protects depositors. Under this first notion of bank capital, hybrid claims such as
preferred equity or subordinated debt are counted as bank capital, since both are claims
that are junior to depositors.
However, there is a second, contrasting notion of bank capital as the claim held by the
owners of the bank who have control over the bank’s operations. Hybrid claims such as
preferred shares or subordinated debt do not qualify as bank capital under this second
notion of bank capital, as they can be seen as junior forms of debt. We could dub this
second notion of capital as “pure equity capital”. This notion of capital can be thought of
as the equity demanded by creditors as a safeguard against losses on their stake. It is
9

analogous to the margin requirement set by creditors on leveraged traders, and is
exemplified by the “haircut” demanded by creditors in a repurchase agreement. In
contrast to the Basel capital requirement (which is a regulatory capital requirement), we
could characterize the pure equity requirement in the margin or haircut set by a creditor
as the “market-determined” capital requirement. Just as with repo haircuts and margin
requirements, the market determined capital requirement fluctuates over time with shifts
in market conditions and the balance sheet capacity of leveraged traders.
The key difference between the Basel notion of capital as a buffer to protect depositors
and pure equity capital as the market-determined haircut lies in the behavior of those
owners who have control over the bank. When the bank has too little pure equity capital,
the owners’ incentives reflect their highly leveraged balance sheet. When faced with a
dwindling stake in a leveraged entity, controlling owners have little to lose, and
everything to gain by engaging in risk-shifting bets on the bank. The increased haircut
imposed by the capital market during distress episodes could be seen as the increased
margin demanded by creditors in the capital market to changed incentives, or the
reduction in funding capacity of an asset in anticipation of the attendant risk-shifting
problem 12.
The market-determined capital requirement reflected in the repo haircut is a constraint
imposed by the capital market, and reflects the terms on which creditors are willing to
lend to those with control over the leveraged entity. One plausible channel through
which the constraint operates is the wish by creditors to avoid being embroiled in a
lengthy and costly bankruptcy settlement after the borrower has defaulted. When a bank
breaches the maximum leverage ratio permitted by the market, the bank must take
remedial action to reduce its leverage, or face a run by its creditors.
When bank capital is viewed as the equity that creditors demand in the market, then there
is a maximum degree of leverage that the market will permit. The haircut in a repo
contract encapsulates such a notion of equity. The market demands a minimum stake to
be held by the entity that controls the asset. As the market haircut fluctuates in line with
capital market conditions, so will the maximum leverage that the market permits. If a
bank breaches the maximum leverage, it must find new equity to bring down leverage or
face a run by its creditors.
We have seen that throughout the recent crisis, banks have lost pure equity capital
through credit losses and dividend payouts, but have not replenished the lost pure equity
capital through the issuance of new common equity. Instead, the lion’s share of new
capital raised has been in the form of hybrid claims such as preferred shares and
subordinated debt. In particular, government-sponsored capital injections have taken the
form of preferred equity, especially in the United States under the TARP program. The
consequence has been that pure equity capital continued to dwindle during the crisis
period.
12

Acharya and Viswanathan (2007) build a model of funding liquidity of financial institutions tied to such
a risk-shifting problem

10

It would be reasonable to conjecture that the stringency in credit conditions reflects, at
least in part, the lack of pure equity capital in the banking system. The marketdetermined capital requirement was binding as hard as ever, even though the constraints
of the regulatory Basel capital requirements were relaxed through the injection of hybrid
claims. Without concerted efforts to relax the market-determined capital requirements
that are pressing down on the banks, it would be difficult to expect much headway in
freeing up credit conditions towards greater willingness of the banks to extend credit.
Leverage
The distinction between regulatory (Basel) capital and pure equity capital can also be
seen through the evolution of various bank leverage ratios. The examination underscores
the earlier evidence that asset growth of banks in the period 2000-2007 was funded
primarily through debt, especially through short-term debt, and not through the build up
of common equity capital.
Table 6 shows the leverage ratios for the 25 large financial firms in our sample – divided
into commercial banks, investment banks and GSEs 8 – for the fiscal years 2000 through
2007. The numbers reported are averages within each division. Figures 6a-6d are based
on the time-series evolution of four of these ratios, which we focus on in our discussion.
Figure 6a shows the corporate finance measure of leverage – the debt/shareholder equity
ratio, and Figure 6b shows another measure - the assets/common equity ratio (common
equity being shareholder equity minus preferred equity). In both cases, the pattern for
commercial and investment banks is similar. For both commercial and investment banks,
the capital structure was getting increasingly levered from 2000 to 2007. The debt/
shareholder equity ratio for commercial banks increased from around 5.19 in Q100 to
6.79 in Q407, whereas for investment banks, it increased from 16.19 to 19.39. For GSEs
this ratio decreased from 30.92 to 21.62. The assets/common equity ratio for commercial
banks grew from 15.0 to 22.51, and for investment banks this ratio grew from 26.90 to
35.85 for the same period. For GSEs this ratio increased from 39.59 to 41.85.
Table 6c shows the asset/ shareholder ratio for large US financial firms. For commercial
banks this ratio increased from 14.68 to 22.11. For investment banks, the Q100 ratio was
much higher at 26.13 and increased to 33.91 in Q407. For GSEs this ratio decreased from
32.8 to 23.57 during the same period.
Table 7 and corresponding Figure 7 show the change in asset to common equity ratio
during the crisis for the large US financial firms in our sample. This ratio increased from
1Q07 to the peak of the crisis in 2Q and 3Q2008 for most firms. Of note, the ratio for
Citigroup increased from 16.69 in 1Q07 to 27.32 in 4Q08. The ratio for Lehman also
increased from 29.73 in Q107 to 33.16 in 2Q08 just before it went bankrupt. This

11

increase in asset to common equity ratio was even more dramatic for the GSEs as they
became distressed. The ratio for Fannie Mae peaked in 3Q08 at 67.47 from a much lower
25.32 in Q107. For Fannie Mae, commercial paper/assets increased from 34.62 to a
staggering 853.44 in 2Q08.
It is clear thus that the asset growth that banks experienced during 2000 to 2007 was
increasingly funded by debt. What kind of debt? To shed light on this, we plot in Figure
6d the ratio of commercial paper to total assets for commercial banks, investment banks
and GSEs in our sample. While investment banks were always financed in a significant
way through unsecured short-term commercial paper, what is striking is that commercial
banks increased their reliance on commercial paper nine-fold from fiscal year 2000 to
fiscal year 2007. In 4Q07, commercial paper was 3% of assets for commercial banks.
This is comparable to investment banks with a ratio of 2.88% in 4Q07.
Further, while the growth in loans and assets was primarily of the long-term type –
mortgages to a large extent and corporate and private equity finance to some extent – the
nature of non-deposit debt financing was in fact of the short-term type. That is, bank
capital structures were not only looking increasingly levered and funded through nondeposit type debt, they were also experiencing a rise in maturity mismatch (or duration
gap between assets and liabilities) and were thus vulnerable to economy-wide shocks that
generally tend to cripple the markets for short-term financing.
This short-term aspect of bank leverage is captured in Tables 8 and 9, and corresponding
Figure 8. Table 8 shows the worldwide quarterly outstanding amounts for commercial
paper – usually of 90-day maturity and more than 75% of which tends to be issued by
financial institutions. From a steady issuance of around $1.4-1.5 trillion per quarter
during 2000-2004, the amount rose sharply to a peak of $2.14 trillion during 2Q07.
Following the money-market freeze of August 9, 2007, the figure fell sharply from its
peak to around $1.62 trillion in 3Q08 (picking up somewhat in 4Q08 due to guarantees,
for example, by the Federal Reserve). In 2009, commercial paper issuance declined
further and in 4Q09 this figure was around $1.14 trillion.
Viewed from any dimension – overall leverage, deposit versus non-deposit leverage, and
maturity of leverage – banks were pursuing a risk-shifting strategy, and importantly, not
just through their choice of assets, but also through their capital structures.
There is one important lesson for bank regulation in all this. While standard corporate
finance measures of capital, dividend distribution and leverage were individually and
jointly implying that bank behavior reflected a serious conflict of interest between
shareholders and creditors, regulatory measures of capital adequacy – for example, the
ratio of capital to risk-adjusted assets – hardly moved (see, for example, Box 1.3 of IMF,
2008). Why was this so? While some of this had to do with the large holdings of AAArated tranches of mortgage-backed securities on bank balance-sheets, which attracted
little capital charge and thus kept the level of risk-adjusted assets (the denominator) to a
low figure, the measurement of capital (the numerator) was also problematic.

12

Implications for reform of financial regulation
The distinction between Basel capital and pure equity capital emphasized here have
important implications for the reform of financial regulation and the resolution of
problem banks that can lead to a speedy recovery in lending.
To some extent, some inertia is inevitable in the valuation of bank assets, even in a world
where the rigorous application of mark-to-market valuation rules are the preferred norm.
Even under the original version of accounting standards such as the US accounting
standard 157 of the FASB, or the International Accounting Standards Board rule IAS 39,
full and immediate marking to market of assets is infeasible due to the lack of transparent
markets. There is the larger issue of whether full marking to market is even desirable
from a financial stability viewpoint. Here, we will not address this particular debate.
However, even for a fervent supporter of full marking to market as an ideal, the practical
limitation of marking to market of bank assets means that inertia is an inevitable feature
of bank balance sheet accounting.
In a world where bank balance sheets lag market conditions, or where the accounting
values do not anticipate further credit losses from foreseeable weakening of
macroeconomic activity, an early suspension of dividends and capital preservation is one
policy that could help forestall greater problems with capital erosion in the future.
Another policy that could help with capital preservation is a “covenant” style private
contract imposed by the prudential regulator that restricts banks from paying out
dividends when certain thresholds are reached. The covenant thresholds may be based on
simple leverage measures such as asset to common equity ratios, loans to deposits and
short-term debt to assets. Additionally, market measures such as equity retention implied
by repo haircuts may provide more timely information and prevent further equity erosion
by forcing banks to stop paying out dividends in times of distress. The recently agreed
Basel III rules set a minimum common equity threshold of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets
plus a “conservation buffer” of 2.5%. The conservation buffer can be breached during
crises, but the intention is that banks that breach it will face limitations on the payout of
dividends or on compensation of its employees. Debate is possible on whether 4.5% +
2.5% is large enough, and whether the Basel risk-weighting schemes are based on
relevant criteria such as systemic risk, but the form of the new Basel III rules take
account of some of the lessons mentioned above.
From the point of view of overall financial system stability and the externalities imposed
by one institution on the system as a whole, an early suspension of dividends can be
justified by the prevention of negative spillover effects imposed by incumbent controlling
shareholders of weakening banks on the rest of the system. Although such interference in
the management of the firm runs counter to the autonomy of the controlling shareholders
in determining the financial decisions of the firm, it should be borne in mind that banking
has always offered exceptions to the autonomy of the firm when externalities are
involved. The fact that banks have been regulated reflects their special status. They
exert externalities on the rest of the financial system so that the affairs of the bank affect
13

a very broad constituency that go beyond the traditional domain of the owners and
creditors of the firm. They affect the broader economy and are supported by both explicit
and implicit public funding support in case of difficulties. The very fact that banks are
regulated, and special legal regimes exist to deal with problems of distress reflect their
special status. An early suspension of dividends is merely re-drawing the line between
the private and public domains of actions.
Thus, an early imposition of regulatory sanctions against the paying of dividends (for
instance, as part of an increasing “ladder of sanctions” that are based on market or
common-equity based notions of bank leverage) may have an important place in the
agenda for reform of the regulatory system. The proposals in the Geneva Report
(Brunnermeier et al., 2009) argue for such a ladder of sanctions. Acharya, Mehran, and
Thakor (2010) suggest creating a capital account by diverting dividends during good
times which are then transferred to a regulator when the bank goes bankrupt. Recently,
Eric Rosengren, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has argued for a
similar prompt suspension of dividends as the first step in dealing with a banking crisis
(Rosengren (2010)).
Conclusion
In this paper, we have delved deeper into the evolution of bank capital during the current
global financial crisis. The crisis which initially erupted in 2007 in the subprime
mortgage sector in the United States has led to a decline in real economic activity,
leading to further credit losses in other mainstream credit categories such as prime
mortgages, commercial real estate, corporate debt and other household debt such as credit
card loans and auto loans.
Even as banks and financial intermediaries have suffered large credit losses as the
financial crisis has gathered pace, the headline numbers obscure important shifts in the
composition of bank capital, and hence on the constraints banks face in their daily
operations. We have shown that the bulk of the new capital raised both from private
investors and from government-funded capital injections have been in the form of debtlike hybrid claims such as preferred equity and subordinated debt, and not in the form of
common equity. Furthermore, banks have continued to pay large sums in the form of
dividends that have further eroded the common equity base.
As a result, there has been a relentless increase in the leverage of the banking sector,
when leverage is measured with common equity on the denominator. We have argued
that common equity is the more appropriate notion of bank capital when we want to
capture the idea of market-based capital requirements that creditors would like to impose
on borrowers. The alternative notion of bank capital which includes subordinate debt and
hybrid claims (as a buffer against loss for depositors) is less appropriate, even though this
latter notion of capital is what is enshrined in the current banking regulations.

14

We argued that continuing dividend payments during the crisis represent a transfer from
equity holders of banks to creditors (and taxpayers) in violation of the priority of debt
over equity. We have further argued that the increased riskiness of the remaining assets
of the bank represent a type of risk-shifting that benefits equity holders at the expense of
creditors (and taxpayers).
In general, the events of the financial crisis of 2007-2009 have posed several challenging
questions on the proper notion of bank capital that should inform bank regulation. We
offer our paper as a small step in this important debate.
