ABSTRACT
Heuristic models have been proposed for many domains of choice. We compare heuristic models of
intertemporal choice, which can account for many of the known intertemporal choice anomalies, to
discounting models. We conduct an out-of-sample, cross-validated comparison of intertemporal choice
models. Heuristic models outperform traditional utility discounting models, including models of exponential
and hyperbolic discounting. The best performing models predict choices by using a weighted average
of absolute differences and relative (percentage) differences of the attributes of the goods in a choice
set. We conclude that heuristic models explain time-money tradeoff choices in experiments better
than utility discounting models.

Main Body
Introduction
People make many decisions with both short-term and long-term consequences. For
example, smoking a cigarette has the immediate benefit of averting nicotine withdrawal and the
long-term risk of lung cancer. Decisions involving consequences at different points in time are
referred to as intertemporal choices (see Frederick, Loewenstein, & O'Donoghue, 2002, for a
review).
The primary theoretical paradigm that has been used to explain intertemporal choice has
been the theory of delay discounting (Ainslie, 1975; Frederick, Loewenstein, & O'Donoghue,
2002), which assumes that delayed rewards are discounted more as they are moved further into
the future. The rate at which delayed consequences lose value is referred to as a discount rate.
Discount rates are sometimes used as a measure of impatience.
There are several well-known models of delay discounting, including the classical
economic model of exponential discounting, which assumes a constant discount rate (Samuelson,
1937); and the more recent hyperbolic discounting model, which assumes that discount rates
decline as time to delivery increases (Ainslie, 1975). A large body of research has measured
discount rates to characterize individual differences in impatience (e.g., Kirby, Petry & Bickel,
1999; Shamosh et al., 2008).
With delay discounted utility, intertemporal preferences are modeled with a discount
function, D(t), and a utility (or value) function u(x). The utility function translates rewards (e.g.
$1 or a serving of food) into units of value for the individual (20 servings of food may not be 20

HEURISTICS EXPLAIN INTERTEMPORAL CHOICE
4
times as valuable as a single serving to an individual). The discount function measures how that
unit of utility decays if it is delivered at a time delay of t periods. The total value of a reward x at
time t is the (multiplicative) product of the discount function and the utility function.
The canonical experimental task used to measure discount functions is an intertemporal
choice task in which individuals choose between a smaller-earlier monetary reward and a largerlater monetary reward. We refer to such tasks as Money Earlier or Later (MEL) tasks. MEL tasks
are typically assumed to measure a decision-maker’s discount function directly (Frederick,
Loewenstein, & O'Donoghue, 2002). However, the results of MEL tasks exhibit several
empirical regularities that cannot be accounted for easily by theories of delay discounting. For
example, an extensive body of research has found that individuals are more impatient (per unit
time) for shorter time horizons than longer ones (Ainslie, 1975; Loewenstein & Prelec, 1992;
Laibson, 1997; Prelec, 2004) — a finding that cannot be explained by simple exponential
discounting. Several different (and complementary) extensions have been offered to account for
this apparent anomaly. Some researchers have argued that decreasing impatience reflects
nonlinear perceptions of time (Ebert & Prelec, 2007; Zauberman, Kim, Malkoc, & Bettman,
2009) or diminished sensitivity to delay (Scholten and Read 2010). Other researchers have
explained it with hyperbolic discounting, which has become the leading model of intertemporal
choice in psychology. But a large accumulation of additional findings, including studies of subadditive discounting (Read, 2001), date/delay discrepancies (Read, Frederick, Orsel, & Rahman,
2005), similarity effects (Rubinstein, 1988; Rubinstein, 2003), delay/speedup asymmetries, and
query-order effects (Loewenstein & Thaler, 1989; Weber et al., 2007) suggests that intertemporal
choice is not well described by either exponential or hyperbolic discounted utility models.

Heuristics provide an alternative approach to understanding intertemporal choice
behavior. Heuristics are shortcuts that afford simpler, if not optimal solutions to a problem. We
describe a model of decision-making, which we call the intertemporal choice heuristic (ITCH)
model, in which decisions are made by using simple arithmetic heuristics to compare earlier and
later options. This approach is consistent with a general preference for earlier rewards, without
making any assumptions about the existence of an underlying discount function. In this respect,
it is closely related to two other heuristic models of decision making in intertemporal
choice— the DRIFT model of Read et al. (Read, Frederick & Scholten, 2013), and the tradeoff
model of Scholten and Read (2010). The ITCH model is motivated by a large literature
concerning the use of heuristics in decision making, including attribute-based models of choice
(Tversky, 1972; Payne, Bettman, & Johnson, 1988) and proportional thinking (Bordalo,
Gennaioli, & Shleifer, 2012; Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). Here, we compare how heuristic
models compare to models that assume systematic discounting.
First, we show that the functional form of the ITCH model can account for a number of
the anomalies concerning human performance in MEL tasks reported in the literature. In the
ITCH model, decisions depend on the sum of absolute and relative (percentage) differences of
the attributes of reward – specifically, the absolute and relative differences in dollars and the
absolute and relative differences in time. By considering both absolute and relative comparisons,
the ITCH model is able to account for patterns of decision-making that have been a challenge to
explain in terms of utility and discount functions.
Second, to make rigorous comparisons between different models used to interpret
behavior in MEL experiments, we collect data on MEL choices in a variety of framing
conditions and use these to conduct model comparisons. Unlike earlier studies, our use of out-of-

HEURISTICS EXPLAIN INTERTEMPORAL CHOICE
6
sample evaluation methods to conduct model comparisons provides an unbiased estimate of the
extent to which different models fit the empirical data collected in typical MEL tasks. To do so,
we employ cross-validation techniques that are now widely used for model comparison in
contemporary statistics and machine learning (Kohavi, 1997; Arlot & Celisse, 2010). By
conducting a quantitative, out-of-sample comparison of the fit of heuristic and discounting
models to empirical data, we show that the heuristic models do significantly better at accounting
for people’s intertemporal choice behavior than standard discounting models. We conclude by
discussing the differences among the heuristic models. Critically, however, our results show
that, when confronted with intertemporal choices involving money, people use heuristics rather
than systematic discounting to make their decisions.
Intertemporal Choice Heuristics Model (ITCH Model)
As suggested above, the ITCH model is based on psychological principles rather than
economic theory. In particular, the ITCH model is inspired by a large body of research in
judgment and decision-making that provide support for attribute-based models of choice. In
attribute-based models, a decision-maker weighs several distinct reasons for and against taking a
decision. For example, Lichtenstein and Slovic’s seminal study of risky choice found that the
relevant weight placed on certain attributes reliably shifts when participants make binary choices
versus situations in which people estimate the monetary value of a gamble (Lichtenstein &
Slovic, 1971). Similarly, Shafir et al. describe decision-making in terms of reasons for and
against a decision that can be used as retrospective justifications for a decision (Shafir, Simonson
& Tversky, 1993).
Likewise, the ITCH model assumes that decision-makers compare the two options in a
typical MEL task in terms of the reasons that would argue for or against each option. These

HEURISTICS EXPLAIN INTERTEMPORAL CHOICE
7
heuristic comparisons generate a vector of arguments for and against selecting the earlier or later
option. Using these comparisons, participants construct a weighted combination that determines
the probability of choosing each of the two options in a MEL task.
The specific heuristics used in the ITCH model involve the simplest arithmetic
comparisons that can be made between the two options (e.g., subtracting and/or dividing them)
along each of the two relevant dimensions (i.e., dollar value and time of delivery). The
application of each heuristic to a particular pair of options generates a vector of four features for
that choice (i.e., the results of each simple arithmetic computation), each of which favors one
option or the other. The model assumes that the final decision is made based on a weighted sum
of these four features. The weights can be interpreted as reflecting the attentional focus and/or
importance placed on each heuristic comparison. The model is consistent both with individuals
using all four heuristics and attaching different weights to them and/or as an approximation to a
model in which each individual relies only on a single (or subset of) heuristics, and the heuristics
that are used are chosen probabilistically (across tasks or individuals).
Below, we show that the ITCH model provides a good fit to data from five different
variants of a MEL task. The pattern of weights it assigns to the heuristics is broadly consistent
across participants and task variants, suggesting that people use a stable combination of
heuristics when evaluating MEL questions, irrespective of manipulations of content and context.
In addition, the differences in relative weights assigned to different heuristics across task variants
offer additional insights into the decision-making process, as these weights provide a mechanism
for quantifying the differential importance assigned to different heuristics in different framing
contexts.

HEURISTICS EXPLAIN INTERTEMPORAL CHOICE
8
The heuristics of the ITCH model implement four basic psychological principles: (a)
participants compare each option relative to a reference point (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979); (b)
comparisons are performed in both absolute terms (by subtraction) and relative terms (by
division) (Thurstone, 1927); (c) comparisons are performed independently along the monetary
and time dimensions (Lichtenstein & Slovic, 1971); and (d) the results of these comparisons are
then aggregated linearly using a set of decision weights (Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993). We
apply these principles to intertemporal choice, but these could also be applied to develop
heuristic choice models in other domains; see the heuristic model of risky choice in Mellers et al.
(1995).
Mathematical Specification of the ITCH Model
We formalize the ITCH model (for binary choices) as follows. The ITCH model treats
the dimensions of time and money symmetrically. Each of the two options is written in the form
(x, t), where x is the option’s monetary value and t is the time the money would be received. The
probability of choosing the larger later option, denoted P(LL), in a choice between a smaller,
earlier amount of money, (x1, t1), and a larger, later amount of money, (x2, t2), is expressed as,


x 2  x1
t 2  t1 
P(LL)  L   I  xA(x 2  x1)  xR *  tA (t 2  t1) tR * 

x
t 
where (x*, t*) represents a reference point that is the arithmetic average of the two options along
each dimension:

x* 

x1  x2
,
2

t* 

t1  t2
.

HEURISTICS EXPLAIN INTERTEMPORAL CHOICE

In this equation, L is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a logistic distribution with
mean 0 and variance 1. Thus, each term of the model represents either an absolute or
proportional arithmetic operation that compares the options along a particular dimension (dollar
value and time). Each term is multiplied by a parameter β that represents the weight given to
each heuristic in making the decision between the two choices. The weighted sum of the
outcomes predicted by each heuristics then determines the probability of choosing one option or
the other. This model can be fit to data from different versions of a MEL task to estimate and
compare the parameters across conditions. (See SOM-R).
The ITCH model can explain the two most robust and widely observed phenomena in
MEL tasks— decreasing impatience and the absolute magnitude effect— in terms of a single,
consistent set of heuristics: the simultaneous consideration of absolute and relative differences
between the two options. For example, when the weight on relative time βtR is negative (as in our
fitted estimates), the ITCH model predicts that the probability of choosing the larger, later
amount will increase as both options are delayed by an additional identical amount of time—e.g.
by adding a front-end delay to both options. Such decreasing impatience (Prelec, 2004) has often
been interpreted as evidence of hyperbolic discounting (Ainslie, 1975). According to the ITCH
model, this is a natural consequence of including both relative and absolute differences in time:
the relative difference between the timing of the two goods decreases as the earliest available
option moves into the future – even as the absolute difference is held fixed.
Consider the following concrete example. If the participant uses weights (0.0, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, -0.1) and selects between $10 today and $20 tomorrow, then the probability of choosing the
later option is


20 10
1 0 
P(LL)  L  0 0.1(20 10) 0.1
 0.1 (1 0) 0.1
 0.68
(20 10)/ 2
(10) / 2 


HEURISTICS EXPLAIN INTERTEMPORAL CHOICE
10
In contrast, if the participant selects between $10 in 10 days and $20 in 11 days, only the relative
time term changes. The probability of choosing the later option increases to


20 10
1110 
P(LL)  L  0 0.1(20 10) 0.1
 0.1 (1110) 0.1
 0.72
(20 10)/ 2
(1110) / 2 

ITCH also makes the prediction that, when the weight on the monetary difference term
βxA is positive, multiplicatively scaling up the magnitude of the monetary amounts will make
participants more likely to take the later option. This prediction has been confirmed in virtually
all MEL tasks that have tested it and is often referred to as the Absolute Magnitude Effect
(Loewenstein & Prelec, 1992). Using the same weights as before (0.0, 0.1, 0.1, -0.1, -0.1),
consider what happens when the stakes are scaled up by a factor of ten. The probability of
choosing the later option when choosing between $10 today and $20 tomorrow is still 0.68.
However, when choosing between $100 today and $200 tomorrow, only the absolute monetary
difference term changes. The probability of choosing the later option will be:

200  100
1 0 
P ( LL)  L  0 0.1(200  100) 0.1
 0.1 (1  0) 0.1
 0.99
(200 100)/ 2
(1 0) / 2 


The magnitude effect can also be generated by a concave value function for rewards (e.g. as in
the tradeoff model). In general, a model in which decisions are made based on a combination of
absolute and relative comparisons mimics the effects otherwise attributed to psychophysical
curvature or diminishing marginal utility.
Moreover, by letting the intercept term  I vary across different framing conditions, the
ITCH model can also capture the large number of anomalies that can be conceptualized as
presenting the same information in different frames (e.g.  I might be higher in a task that
presents time-dated payments as dates rather than delays). Finally, ITCH is an example of a
heuristic model that produces non-additive discounting behavior (i.e. total discounting over an

HEURISTICS EXPLAIN INTERTEMPORAL CHOICE
11
interval depends on whether it is presented as one long interval or subdivided into separate
intervals); see an extended discussion for a similar model in Scholten and Read (2010).
The ITCH model is similar to other heuristic models of MEL behavior, including both
Scholten and Read (2010)’s tradeoff model and Read et al. (2013)’s DRIFT model. Unlike
systematic discounting models, they do not produce a discounted utility value by multiplying a
discount function and utility function. Instead, like ITCH, they explain choice in terms of the
sum of different factors, including allowing the effects of money and time to be additively
separable. However, these models differ in a few potentially important ways. ITCH includes
absolute and percentage comparisons for time delay, whereas DRIFT only includes an absolute
comparison. The model fits we present below suggest that the percentage comparison for time
delay is statistically significant. DRIFT includes an interest rate term and a term that captures
consumption versus investment framing. The tradeoff model assumes concave functional forms
for perceived time delay and perceived reward magnitude, which are used to account for
diminishing sensitivity. In contrast, ITCH relies exclusively on simple arithmetic comparisons,
which are symmetrically applied to both money and time. Our results below indicate that ITCH
provides a slightly better fit to the data than the alternative heuristic models. However, what is
most significant — in both a statistical and conceptual sense — is that all three heuristic models
provide a substantially better fit than the current standard economic models of intertemporal
decision-making, suggesting that further work developing and refining heuristic models of
intertemporal choice will be fruitful.
Model Comparisons across Five Experiments
We conducted five closely related experiments to compare the three heuristic models
with three standard economic models — the exponential, hyperbolic, and quasi-hyperbolic

HEURISTICS EXPLAIN INTERTEMPORAL CHOICE
12
models of discounting (Samuelson, 1937; Ainslie, 1975; Laibson, 1997). One thousand
participants were recruited from the Mturk.com online labor market. These participants were
randomly assigned to one of five task variants under which 25 hypothetical choices were
presented in a random order. Each condition involved a MEL task that differed in the framing of
the two time-dated options:
1. Absolute $, Delay Framing: $5 today vs. $5 plus an additional $5 in 4 weeks
2. Relative $, Delay Framing: $5 today vs. $5 plus an additional 100% in 4 weeks
3. Standard MEL Format: $5 today vs. $10 in 4 weeks
4. Absolute $, Speedup Framing: $10 in 4 weeks vs. $10 minus $5 today
5. Relative $, Speedup Framing: $10 in 4 weeks vs. $10 minus 50% today
The use of conditions framing the choices as delay vs. speedup parallels the order manipulations
used in the studies by Weber et al. (2007). Within a framing condition, each participant answered
25 randomly generated MEL questions designed to span a large range of dollar amounts and
delays. (See SOM-R)
To compare models, we used a cross-validation approach in which each model was fit to
one subset of our data and then tested on another subset of data. In order to generate many
training and test datasets, we randomly subsampled 75% of the data as a training dataset and
25% as a test set; we repeated this subsampling procedure 100 times. Cross-validation provides
an unbiased method for comparing the predictive power of models with different numbers of
parameters, which is necessary in our case because the each of the heuristic models has more
parameters than some of the discounting models with which they were compared (Kohavi,
1995). Cross-validation is a type of out-of-sample analysis. In contrast, standard measures of

HEURISTICS EXPLAIN INTERTEMPORAL CHOICE
13
model fit applied in-sample (e.g. the calculation of R2 values) do not provide reliable indicators
of the generalizability of fitted models.
In all five experiments, the three heuristic models (ITCH, DRIFT, and tradeoff)
outperformed all of the standard delay discounted utility models of intertemporal choice in
predicting participants’ choices. The specification of each model is listed in the SOM-R. Within
the heuristic class, the ITCH model outperformed the tradeoff and DRIFT models. Table S1
shows the results when, separately for each experimental condition, we fit the model on the
training data and tested it on the testing data for that condition. (Note that this method thus lets
model parameters vary by condition, capturing generalizations of each model that would let
parameters differ between delay v. speedup and absolute v. relative frames).
Since relative model performance results are similar across conditions, Figure 1 presents
a pooled analysis of model performance across conditions. In this analysis, for each crossvalidation subsample, we estimated one set of model parameters on the training data pooled from
all five experimental conditions and then assessed the fit on the pooled testing data.

The error bars reflect the variability of the model comparison results under cross-validation.

HEURISTICS EXPLAIN INTERTEMPORAL CHOICE
15
For the ITCH model, we found that the β decision weights for the four component
heuristics were relatively stable across experimental conditions. Figure 2 plots six sets of
decisions weights: the weights when estimated separately on the five conditions, plus a set of
weights estimated on the pooled data across all conditions (see also Table S3 for raw numbers).
Absolute time and relative time were weighted similarly, but relative money received much
higher weight than absolute money; we speculate that this was due to a much larger range in
dollar reward amounts available than time delays available.
Although the magnitude of the parameters varied across fits, the pattern of decision
weight β parameters were stable across framing conditions. The estimates imply that participants
assigned a qualitatively similar pattern of relative weights to the heuristics represented by each
term of the ITCH model, irrespective of manipulations of task content or context. Moreover,
variations in parameter estimates across conditions capture variations between the comparisons
made salient by each of the tasks. The ratios of the relative to absolute comparison coefficients
are higher in the conditions that emphasize relative differences of money than in conditions that
emphasize absolute differences in money. Because our frames always presented time delays in
absolute, not relative, terms, we expected to see less variation in the coefficients on relative time.
Finally, the variation in the intercept term  I also captures differences between conditions in
generalized impatience.

Figure 2. The pattern of decision weights is highly consistent across different forms of MEL
tasks. Six sets of decision weights are shown: one for each of the five condition, plus a sixth set
estimated on the pooled data. To make decision weights more readily comparable, we z-scored
all inputs. We tested the consistency of decision weights by computing the pairwise correlations
between decision weights across the six data sets and comparing this against the null hypothesis
of no correlation (t = 125.977, df = 35, p < 10-14).
Discussion
To understand the anomalous decision-making behavior observed in MEL experiments,
we developed an alternative account of behavior in MEL tasks – the ITCH model – based on
basic psychological principles, including reference points and simple arithmetic comparisons.
The results of our model comparisons show that both this model and the other two heuristic

HEURISTICS EXPLAIN INTERTEMPORAL CHOICE
17
models provide substantially better fits to choices in MEL tasks than standard economic models
of intertemporal choice that rely on a discount function.
The fit of the ITCH model demonstrated that the relative weights assigned to each of the
heuristics in the model were stable across individuals and a range of conditions. Moreover, the
variations in the weights across framings were themselves interpretable in terms of the relative
salience of different comparisons suggested by question framing. Thus, while participants’
decision making behavior in MEL tasks may not be meaningfully described by a discount
function, our findings suggest that decision-making in MEL tasks nevertheless exhibits a form of
psychological stability that may generalize to other tasks.
In summary, our findings raise two important points. The ability of heuristic models to
predict behavior in MEL tasks suggests that for these tasks, as for many other decision-making
tasks, people may apply simple heuristics to generate a response that is sufficient for their
purposes rather than employ a decision-process that mirrors conventional economic models. The
ITCH model and related models show that a weighted combination of simple heuristics can
model time-money tradeoffs in MEL tasks well. Future research should evaluate the usefulness
of this approach for other types of intertemporal choices besides MEL, as decision-making tasks
in other domains, such as risky choice.

Materials and Methods for Experiments 1-5
For these experiments, we recruited 1,000 participants from the Amazon.com Mechanical
Turk online labor market. Our sample size was determined based on previous exploratory studies
in which we found a sample size of 1000 participants was sufficient to fit various discount
functions to the data. We collected these 1000 participants and stopped collecting further data.
Participants were randomly assigned to one of the five task variants described in the main
text. They made hypothetical choices, allowing us to use a large range of monetary rewards. We
generated random questions that spanned dollar amounts from $0.01 to $100,000.00 and time
amounts from 0 weeks to 6 weeks. The specific questions shown to each participant were
randomly generated in order to make the four terms of Equation 1 in the main text orthogonal
across participants.
We estimated the parameters of the ITCH model using standard maximum likelihood
estimation techniques for Generalized Linear Models. To compare models, we performed a
cross-validation analysis that repeatedly split the data into two randomly generated parts: the first
part consisted of 75% of the data and was used to estimate the parameters of our model; the
second part consisted of 25% of the data and was used to assess the model’s fit to “held out” data
(Kohavi, 1995). We assessed model fit using the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) between a
model’s prediction (which is a probability between 0 and 1) and the actual choice indicator
(which is 0 or 1 depending on whether the LL option was chosen) because this metric is
interpretable on the scale of probabilities and robust to outliers. (When model fit is assessed
using held-out log likelihood and Root Mean Squared Error, the results are qualitatively similar).
We compared the ITCH model with seven other models of intertemporal choice: a
baseline model that makes choices by flipping a biased coin, exponential discounting, hyperbolic

discounting, generalized hyperbolic discounting, quasi-hyperbolic discounting, and a fixed cost
model of delay (Benhabib, Bisin & Schotter, 2010). We also estimated the “DRIFT” model of
Read et al. (2013).
Because the discounting models contain nonlinearities and impose theoretical limits on
allowable model parameters, we estimated them via maximum likelihood using a constrained
optimization suite in R that implements the L-BFGS-B algorithm (Zhu, Byrd, Lu, & Nocedal,
1997).
The functional forms of each model are listed below. In each of these models, the
notation, L(z), represents the inverse logistic function of z:

L(z)  (1ez )1
The notation I(x) represents the indicator variable that is 1 if x is true and 0 otherwise. The
variable a represents the logistic scaling parameter.

We find that the exponential, hyperbolic, quasi-hyperbolic and generalized hyperbolic
models can be numerically unstable. To resolve this numeric instability, we compute the
probability of an entire sequence of choices by bounding the per-choice probabilities estimated
using the functional forms above at a value that is not 0 or 1. In our estimation, the exponential,
hyperbolic, quasi-hyperbolic and generalized hyperbolic models perform better when bounded.
Table S1 shows the results when bounded at 0.01 and 0.99. These bounded probabilities are
computed as:

P(LLb )  (1  )P(LL)

For the non-heuristic models, we have also estimated variants in which utilities do not
have constant variance logistic noise (as implied by the inverse logistic function), but are instead
have scale-invariant, homothetic noise. With homothetic noise, the probability of errors depends
on the ratio of the utilities of the two goods, rather than on their absolute difference. This
homothetic noise assumption the following functional forms:


Homothetic exponential model: P(LL)  L(log(x 2 t 2 )  log(x1 t 1 ))



Homothetic hyperbolic model: P(LL)  L(log(x 2(1 t 2 )1 )  log(x1(1 t1)1 ))



Homothetic quasi-hyperbolic model: P(LL)  L(log(x 2  I (t 20) t 2 )  log(x1 I (t 10) t 1 ))

The results comparing the heuristic models against these homothetic models are shown in Table
S2.
