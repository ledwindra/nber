Patent Assertions: Are We Any Closer to Aligning Reward to Contribution?
Fiona Scott Morton and Carl Shapiro
NBER Working Paper No. 21678
October 2015
JEL No. K21,L0
ABSTRACT
The 2011 America Invents Act was the most significant reform to the United States patent system
in over fifty years. However, the AIA did not address a number of major problems associated with
patent litigation in the United States. In this paper, we provide an economic analysis of post-AIA developments
relating to Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) and Standard-Essential Patents (SEPs). For PAEs and
SEPs, we examine the alignment, or lack of alignment, between the rewards provided to patent holders
and their social contributions. Our report is mixed. Regarding PAEs, we see significantly improved
alignment between rewards and contributions, largely due to a series of rulings by the Supreme Court.
Legislation currently under consideration in Congress would further limit certain litigation tactics
used by PAEs that generate rewards unrelated to contribution. We also see some notable developments
relating to SEPs, especially with the recent reform to the patent policies of the IEEE, a leading Standard-Setting
Organization (SSO) and with several recent court decisions clarifying what constitutes a Fair, Reasonable
and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) royalty rate. However, other steps that could better align rewards
with contributions on the SEP front have largely stalled out, particularly because other major SSOs
do not seem poised to follow the lead of the IEEE. Antitrust enforcement in this area could further
improve the alignment of rewards and contributions.

1. Introduction
In September 2011, President Obama signed the America Invents Act, the most significant
reform to the patent system since the 1950s. The America Invents Act (AIA) made major
changes in how the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) reviews patent applications, grants
patents, and considers post-grant challenges to issued patents. These changes were intended to
improve patent quality and shorten patent pendency, two goals with widespread support.
The passage of the America Invents Act did not put an end to calls for patent reform. Far from it.
In the wake of the AIA, evidence has mounted that the rules governing patent litigation are in
need of adjustment: questionable litigation tactics employed by Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs)
attracted widespread attention; the smartphone patent wars heated up, fueled by a combination of
high stakes and legal uncertainty; and controversy swirled around the appropriate antitrust or
contractual limits on how patent holders could assert patents that are essential to practicing
widely adopted technology standards.
While casual observers may be perplexed that the America Invents Act did not “fix” the U.S.
patent system, upon closer look this should not come as a surprise. The AIA did not address
many of the litigation tactics being used by PAEs, or the remedies available to owners of patents
that have been found in court to be valid and infringed. Nor did the AIA address the problems
associated with Standard-Essential Patents (SEPs) or the treatment of patents by the International
Trade Commission (ITC).1 These are the aspects of the patent system we address here.
The flaws in the patent litigation system studied here result from a divergence between the
reward that a patent holder can obtain by asserting its patent and the social contribution
generated by the research and development activities that led to the issuance of that patent. For
this reason, when evaluating various reforms to the patent system, we do not ask whether these
reforms increase or decrease the rewards to patentees. Rather, we ask whether these reforms
better align the private rewards to patentees with their social contributions. This approach to
patent reform is developed in greater detail in Shapiro (2007).
Following this approach, we devote attention here to certain patent litigation tactics that a patent
holder can employ to generate returns that are out of proportion to the social contribution
resulting from the R&D activities that led to the issuance of the patent in question. While the
organizational form of the entity using these tactics is not directly relevant to this question, the
most questionable tactics are often used by entities that specialize in patent assertion. Typically,
these entities either acquire patents to monetize them or inherit patents from unsuccessful
operating companies. Scott Morton and Shapiro (2014) offer some explanations for this
observed relationship between strategy and structure. Most notably, entities with little or no
revenues from their own products and services are not vulnerable to countersuits accusing them
of patent litigation. For them, patent litigation is a form of “asymmetric warfare.” Furthermore,
entities that specialize in asserting and monetizing patents are likely to suffer little harm from
alienating target firms, since unlike many operating companies they do not need to cooperate

The AIA did make a number of changes to the rules governing patent litigation: it placed limits on ability of patent
holders to name multiple defendants in a single patent infringement lawsuit, it modestly expanded the prior user
defense, and it removed the “best mode” defense. But none of these changes directly addressed the problems
identified and discussed in this article.

with these target firms on other fronts, and indeed may benefit from developing a reputation for
employing scorched-earth patent litigation strategies.
Ultimately, the ability of a patent holder to use the patent system to extract revenues from target
firms must be based on the costs it can impose on them. These costs generally come in three
forms. First, a target firm must bear litigation expenses to defend itself against allegations of
patent infringement. We discuss how certain litigation tactics employed by patent holders can
impose large and asymmetric litigation costs on patent defendants, even if the underlying patent
infringement claim is weak. Second, a target firm that loses the patent litigation will be forced to
pay infringement damages. Typically, these damages come in the form of reasonable royalties.
We address how the courts assess reasonable royalties in patent cases. Third, a target firm that
loses the patent litigation may be subject to an injunction preventing it from selling infringing
products. We discuss how and when the courts issue such injunctions, especially for SEPs, and
how the ITC issues exclusion orders, which can have a similar effect. All of this points to patent
reforms that affect litigation costs, the determination of reasonable royalties, and the use of
injunctions, regardless of the organizational form taken by the party asserting the patent.2
In this paper, we provide an update on how well the U.S. patent litigation system delivers
rewards to patent holders commensurate with their R&D contributions in the wake of the
America Invents Act. Overall, we believe there has been considerable progress on several fronts,
especially due to a series of major decisions by the Supreme Court, but progress on some other
fronts appears to be blocked. We frame the analysis in the paper using two constructs: the
underlying quality of the patent, and the type of cost a patent holder can create for the
implementer, as described above. We apply this framework to two main areas: Patent Assertion
Entity activity and the assertion of Standard-Essential Patents. For each of these areas, we
identify where progress has been made and where significant problems remain.
Before looking more closely at specific changes in the U.S. patent litigation system, it is worth
pausing to emphasize the crucial distinction between reforms to the patent system that affect the
issuance of new patents versus the assertion of existing patents. Reforms that affect the issuance
of new patents, such as those in the AIA, necessarily have only a gradual impact on patent
litigation, as the newly-issued patents over time grow to comprise a larger share of the total stock
of outstanding patents and litigated patents. To illustrate, in Fiscal Year 2011, during which the
America Invents Act was passed, the PTO issued 221,350 utility patents, but there were roughly
ten times as many utility patents in force, some 2.2 million.3 Among litigated patents, Love
(2013) shows that the average lag from patent application to the end of all litigation with that

2

The model in Scott Morton and Shapiro (2014) provides conditions under which a PAE promotes rather than
retards innovation. While the organizational form of the entity asserting the patent does not directly enter into this
determination, any approach to patent assertion that involves high transaction costs will be more likely to retard
innovation, ceteris paribus. Scott Morton and Shapiro (2014) report evidence that patent assertion by PAEs is a
very leaky bucket, i.e., only a small fraction of the costs imposed on target firms makes its way back as a reward to
the entities that initially conducted the R&D leading to the patents being asserted. Reforms that reduce the
transaction costs associated with patent litigation improve the operation of the patent system so long as they do not
worsen the alignment between patentee reward and contribution.

patent is 16.1 years for patents asserted by non-practicing entities.4 In 2013, the median patent
asserted by a non-practicing entity in patent litigation had a priority date 15 years earlier, all the
way back in 1998.5 Clearly, reforms that apply to the flow of new patent applications, no matter
how effective, can only very gradually address problems with the assertion and monetization of
the much larger existing stock of patents. This observation alone explains why the passage of the
AIA did not put an end to calls for reform of the patent litigation system.
In Section 2, we look at the tactics used by Patent Assertion Entities, commonly known as
“patent trolls.” PAEs are organizations whose primary or sole activity is the assertion of patents
against target firms. The goal and expertise of PAEs is to efficiently monetize patents by
collecting royalties through the licensing of their patents and by winning patent damage awards
in court. In their purest form, PAEs do not produce or sell products or service. Over the past
several years, PAEs have attracted considerable attention among business executives and those
interested in public policies toward intellectual property rights and innovation.
In Section 3, we explore problems associated with Standard-Essential Patents, regardless of the
form taken by entity owning and asserting them. SEPs present a unique set of challenges at the
intersection of antitrust and patent law and policy. The problems of patent holdup and royalty
stacking can be especially severe for SEPs. Some Standard-Setting Organizations (SSOs) are
modifying their rules to deal with these problems. The Federal courts are assisting with this
process. As a result of these changes, the International Trade Commission (ITC) has become a
policy outlier, based on its authority to issue exclusion orders preventing the importation of
infringing products into the United States.

Three Cost Categories Underlying Patent Monetization
A. Litigation Costs

Patent holders can impose litigation costs on target firms. Of course, this is a natural and
inevitable consequence of any innovation reward system predicated on intellectual property
rights. However, concerns about misalignment between reward and contribution arise if owners
of low-quality patents can impose substantial costs on target firms. We define a patent as “low
quality” with respect to a given patent assertion if the probability that the patent will be found
valid and infringed in that assertion is low.6
In the extreme case of sham litigation, the patent holder knows full well that the target firm is not
infringing its patent, but nonetheless sues for patent infringement in order to extract a settlement.
This fact pattern fits within the definitions of a “nuisance suit” or “frivolous litigation,” as those
terms are defined in the law and economics literature.

Love (2013), Table 5, p. 1335. The comparable number of practicing entities is 11.6 years. The average lag from
patent issuance to the end of litigation is 13.2 years for patents asserted by non-practicing entities and 8.6 years for
patents asserted by practicing entities.

RPX (2014), Chart 52, p. 35. The median priority date of patents asserted by operating companies in 2013 was
three years later, 2001. See Chart 54, p. 36.

6

A specific patent claim may be of low quality because it is likely invalid or because it is not infringed. Invalidity is
a general property of the patent claim, while non-infringement is specific to the target products or processes in a
given patent infringement action.

Page 3

However, the same principle applies more generally if the costs that a patent holder can impose
on target firms are disproportionate to the quality of the patent being asserted. Misalignment
concerns are especially great if (1) litigation costs are highly asymmetric as between the patent
holder and the target firm, or if (2) the entity asserting the patents finds it profitable to persist
with infringement claims that are unprofitable on their own terms (due to low patent quality) in
order to develop a reputation as a tough and persistent asserter of patents. As we discuss below,
both of these conditions are often satisfied in patent infringement actions brought by PAEs.

B. Reasonable Royalties
1. Background
Virtually all patent holders who sue for patent infringement seek damages from the party they
are accusing of patent infringement. Patent damages can come in the form of lost profits or
reasonable royalties. For PAEs and SEPs, our primary topics here, damages almost always come
in the form of reasonable royalties.
The basic idea behind reasonable royalties is straightforward: they are meant to measure the
royalties that would be negotiated ex ante between the patent holder and the infringing party,
assuming that the patents involved are valid and infringed. In this context, ex ante is interpreted
to mean the date just before the infringement began, although an economically more precise
statement would be the date just before the infringing party made significant investments specific
to the use of the patented technology.
The classic case identifying the factors that determine reasonable royalties in the United States is
the Georgia Pacific case.7 The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) has sanctioned
the use of the so-called “Georgia-Pacific” factors to frame the inquiry into the determination of
reasonable royalties.8 Many commentators have pointed out that the Georgia-Pacific factors
often do not provide the most useful framework for the determination of reasonable royalties.9
For our purposes here, two primary issues stand out, neither of which is well captured by the
original Georgia-Pacific factors: royalty stacking and patent hold-up.
First, the presence of other patents that read on the same product can and should affect the
reasonable royalties for any one such patent. In the presence of royalty stacking, it is important
to determine the aggregate level of royalties that will likely be applied to the product in question.
This is especially important for products that comply with standards for which there are many
SEPs, as discussed by Lemley and Shapiro (2007). The use of an appropriate base on which to
compute royalties can help mitigate problems associated with royalty stacking. Recent decision
by the CAFC to calculate royalties based on the revenues from the “smallest saleable patentpracticing unit” are quite helpful in this respect.10

See LaserDynamics Inc. v. Quanta, 694 F.3d 51 (2012). Unfortunately, however, the CAFC has expressly ruled
as a matter of law that the cost to the target firm of adopting a non-infringing technology is not an upper bound on
the reasonably royalty. See Mars. Inc. v. Coin Acceptors, Inc. 527 F.3d 1359 (2008) at 1373. Reconciling this

Second, when implementers make substantial investments that are specific to practicing the
patent in question, the prospect for opportunism by patent holders, i.e., patent hold-up, can be
substantial. Given the probabilistic nature of patents, and difficulties interpreting patent claims,
it can be very difficult for implementers making investments in product development to avoid
exposing themselves to patent infringement actions.
2. Empirical Evidence
Lex Machina (2015) reports data on the patent damage awards resulting from the 42,805 patent
cases filed and terminated in Federal court from 2000 through 2014. Among these cases, 13.4%
reached a merits decision, but only 1.8% involved a compensatory damages award for the
plaintiff.11 Of the total $14.7 billion total awarded in compensatory damages, $8.8 billion was
for reasonable royalties, $3.2 billion was for lost profits, and $2.7 billion did not specify as
between reasonable royalties and lost profits.12 Lex Machina data show clearly that total
reasonable royalty damages grew sharply, from an average of about $190 million per year during
2004-2007 to an average of nearly $1.2 billion per year during 2008-2013.13 Care must be taken
in interpreting these aggregate figures, since they are heavily influenced by a relatively small
number of very large awards.
Lex Machina (2014a) reports that the average patent damage award increased by 28% from
$27.2 million in 2012 to $34.7 million in 2013. This $34.7 million average was driven by a few
very large awards, notably a $1 billion award from DuPont to Monsanto regarding genetically
modified seeds, and two awards from Samsung to Apple, one for $599 million and one for $290
million. The median patent award was much smaller than the average award. The median patent
damage award grew by 22%, from $1.03 million in 2012 to $1.26 million in 2013.14
Both Lex Machina (2014b) and PWC (2014) report a decline in total patent damages from 2012
to 2013. Lex Machina (2015) reports total damages awarded during 2014 of $2.2 billion. One
should not make too much of the data on total patent damages from any one year, given the
magnitude of the mega-awards. However, PWC reports that the median damages awarded has
been declining. By their measure the median award during 2000-2004 was $7.5 million, falling
to $4.9 million during 2005-2009 and $4.3 million during 2010-2013.15
PWC finds a significant difference between the median damages awarded to practicing vs. nonpracticing entities: $2.5 million vs. $8.5 million during 2010-2013.16 They report that the
decision with the hypothetical negotiation framework that underlies the calculation of reasonable royalties seems
very difficult.

15

PWC( 2014), Chart 2a, p. 6. Given the substantial increase in the number of patent infringement cases brought
over this time period, this presumably reflects in significant part a more aggressive approach taken collectively by
patent holders, who are now pursuing cases they would not have brought ten years ago, causing the marginal case to
yield significantly lower damages than the average case.
16

PWC ( 2014), Chart 2b, p. 6. This difference persists, and has been growing, despite the fact that practicing
entities can receive damages for lost profits, while non-practicing entities can only receive reasonable royalties.

Page 5

median award to non-practicing entities grew, from $7.3 million during 2005-2009, while the
median award to practicing entities declined, from $4.3 million during 2005-2009. These data
do not allow us to determine how the mix of patents asserted by practicing vs. non-practicing
entities, or the tactics used by these two type of entities, shifted over time. PWC also sees a
dramatic difference between median damages awarded by judges vs. juries. During 2010-2013,
the median award from a judge was $0.4 million while the median award from a jury was $15.0
million 17
Reasonable royalties were awarded more than twice as often as lost profits during the 2010-2013
time period.18

C. Injunctions
The second major remedy available to patent holders is a permanent injunction preventing the
infringing firm from continuing to make, use, or sell infringing products. Until about ten years
ago, a patent holder that won its patent infringement suit was automatically granted a permanent
injunction, with very few exceptions. This practice fit with the rubric that a patent gives its
owner the right to exclude others from practicing the patented technology.
In 2006, however, the Supreme Court issued a major ruling that substantially narrowed the
circumstances under which patent holders can obtain permanent injunctions. 19 The Supreme
Court’s ruled in the eBay case that a patent holder seeking a permanent injunction must satisfy
the same four-factor test that the courts apply in other areas of the law. In particular, a patent
holder must demonstrate (1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that other remedies
available at law, notably monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3)
that, considering the balance of hardships between the patent holder and the infringing firm, an
injunction is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by an injunction.
For our purposes here, looking at PAEs and SEPs, the key point is that permanent injunctions are
strongly disfavored under eBay for patent holders who do not compete against the infringing
firm, and thus are seeking reasonable royalty damages. We note with respect to PAEs that the
unavailability of an injunction under eBay is not driven by the business form of the patent holder
but rather by the distinction between reasonable royalty damages and lost profit damages.20
17

PWC ( 2014), Chart 4c, p. 9. Presumably, at least in part this reflects the choice by patent holders with the most
promising cases to try their case before a jury rather than a judge. Chart 4a shows that juries were used in 62% of
the patent cases since 2000. But one cannot help but wonder if juries are more generous than judges in awarding
damages in patent infringement cases, ceteris paribus.
18

PWC ( 2014), Chart 6a, p. 10. Some cases involve both lost profits and reasonable royalty damages.

19

eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C. , 547 U.S. 388 (2006).

20

For a non-competing patent owner, while awarding ongoing royalties under eBay is different than awarding
reasonable royalties for past infringement, no new calculation is needed. As noted above, the level of reasonable
royalties is determined by a hypothetical ex ante negotiation prior to the infringing party first making specific
investments in the products or services later found to infringe. In contrast, for patent holders who do compete
against the infringing firm, and thus are seeking lost profit damages, permanent injunctions will fit into the eBay
framework because it is extremely hard to determine compensatory damages for ongoing infringement, even if one
has already calculated lost profits for past infringement (itself an intricate task). In such cases, a court may find it
attractive to delay the imposition of the permanent injunction in order to allow the infringing firm time to develop a
non-infringing alternative.

Page 6

Below, we discuss the conditions under which owners of SEPs can obtain injunctions to prevent
other firms from using the technology covered by the SEPs. Such injunctions can be very
powerful weapons since they prevent the implementer from practicing the standard, which can
have dramatic commercial consequences for standards that are widely accepted and practiced.

3. Retreat of the Trolls?
A. What Harms are Caused by PAEs?
Over the past several years, many observers have expressed concerns that Patent Assertion
Entities are exploiting the patent litigation system in a manner that discourages innovation,
effectively imposing a “tax” on firms that develop and sell innovative goods and services.21
We studied PAEs and expressed such concerns in Scott Morton and Shapiro (2014). In that
paper, we reported data from RPX showing that the number of patent cases filed grew from
2,472 in 2010 to 5,411 in 2013, and that the proportion of these cases filed by non-practicing
entities grew from 30% to 67%.22 RPX data indicate that PAEs accounted for 91% of the patent
infringement actions brought by non-practicing entities in 2013 and 89% in 2014.23 We also
developed a theoretical model to assess the impact of PAEs on innovation, and used that model
to identify the key empirical parameters that determine whether entities that purchase patents to
assert and monetize them generally promote or harm innovation. The available empirical
evidence presented in that paper indicates that, for plausible values of the parameters identified
in our model, such entities generally harm rather than promote innovation. Numerous legal
scholars have provided empirical evidence regarding the costs PAEs impose on target firms that
develop new products and services, reaching similar conclusions.24 We consider it telling that
PAEs rarely transfer technology to implementers, either directly or indirectly. Feldman and
Lemley (2015) find that all of the respondents in their survey who took patent licenses from
NPEs reported receiving technical knowledge along with a patent license in only 0% to 10% of
their NPE licenses.25 Feldman and Lemley summarize their results this way: “With almost
complete unanimity, respondents who took licenses from NPEs, rarely received technical
knowledge, transfer of personnel (including consulting agreements) or joint ventures along with

21

One sharp critic of PAEs is none less than Richard Posner, who writes: “It is extremely difficult to discern any
possible social benefit from trolls, and extremely easy to discern substantial social costs.” Plus this: “It’s not just
that patent trolls don’t do anything that encourages innovation; they impair innovation.” See “Patent Trolls,”
available at http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2013/07/patent-trollsposner.html.

areas of products and services, for 2%, and universities for 1%. We again thank RPX for sharing their data with us.

might suggest even the potential for future innovation were almost entirely absent.”26
1. Federal Trade Commission Study
The FTC described its plans for a “Patent Assertion Entity Study,” along with a solicitation of
comments from the public, in the Federal Register on May 19, 2014. There followed a comment
period. The Office of Management and Budget approved the proposed study on August 8,
2014.27 This FTC study will focus on companies conducting business in the wireless
communications sector. The FTC is now seeking an exhaustive catalog of information and
documentation from PAEs, wireless chip manufacturers, and other technology firms involved in
this sector, covering patent activity beginning Jan 1, 2009.28 Here are two examples of the type
of questions the FTC is asking:


How do PAEs acquire patents; who are the prior patent owners; and how do they
compensate prior patent owners?



How do PAEs engage in assertion activity, i.e., how do they behave with respect to
demands, litigation, and licensing?

It is possible the FTC will have a report by December 2015, as no party has moved to quash, and
respondents seem to be complying with the request.29 However, the study requests a great deal of
data, so, working carefully, it may take the lawyers and the economists at the FTC a significant
period of time to complete their analysis. We expect this report will provide important empirical
evidence about markets for patents and the extent and cost of PAE activity. This study strikes us
as a fine example of how the FTC can use its statutory authority to conduct industry studies. 30
2. MPHJ Technology Investments Case
The FTC alleged that MPHJ Technology Investments made deceptive threats accusing more than
16,000 small business of patent infringement. In November 2014, MPHJ and its law firm agreed
to settle with the FTC on charges of “deceptive sales claims and phony legal threats” against
thousands of small businesses.31 MPHJ had acquired patents relating to network scanning
technology, which the firm then proceeded to assert against many small businesses. MPHJ sent
letters to these businesses informing them that they were infringing on MPHJ’s patents and that
they should purchase a license for thousands of dollars if they planned on using the technology in

Feldman and Lemley (2015), p.27. Perhaps more surprisingly, Feldman and Lemley found that licensing from
practicing entities and universities also was typically not associated with technology transfer.

the future. The FTC settlement provides that any future deception would result in a fine of $16K
per demand letter.32 This high-profile case seems closer to fraud than many other PAE
assertions. Therefore, while it establishes a valuable precedent and deterrent to the most
egregious and widespread demand-letter campaigns, it seems unlikely to have much impact on
PAE activity involving larger individual damages claims directed at specific, selected targets.

B. Declining Returns to the PAE Business Model
There is considerable evidence that PAEs have experienced recent setbacks. The latest data from
RPX show a meaningful decline in the number of patent infringement cases brought by nonpracticing entities, from 3,673 in 2013 to 2,791 in 2914.33 In 2014, non-practicing entities
accounted for 63% of all such cases, down slightly from 67% in 2013.34 Target companies with
less than $100 million in revenue accounted for 62% of the unique defendants newly facing
allegations of patent infringement.35
Whether one applauds or bemoans the activities of PAEs, one of the best indicators of whether
the tide has turned regarding patent assertion may be trends in the market value of the types of
patent portfolios that PAEs have been purchasing. We are not aware of any index that accurately
measures changes in the overall value of a fixed set patents, correcting for patent quality,
coverage, duration, and so forth. We do, however, find it illuminating that Erich Spangenberg,
the owner of IPNav, one of the leading PAEs, has become quite bearish on the value of patents.
At the end of 2014, he predicted a massive decline in the number of patent lawsuits filed along
with major write-downs in the value of patent portfolios.36 Along similar lines, Lu (2015)
examines the prices at which patent portfolios are sold, concluding that the AIA “significantly
depressed the transaction prices of patent assets.”37
The Rockstar consortium is viewed by some industry observers as a PAE. This is the group of
large technology firms that bid for the Nortel patent portfolio when Nortel went bankrupt.
Members include Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Sony, and others, but notably not Google, which
put in the original stalking horse bid for the portfolio. The portfolio originally included 6000
patents and sold for a record-setting $4 billion. Members distributed 2000 patents amongst
themselves (each member preserving a royalty-free license to the entire portfolio) and the
remaining 4000 patents were sold in December 2014. RPX, the patent defense firm, purchased

the patents for one-quarter of the original auction price, or $900M, although the portfolio does
not include perhaps the most valuable 2000 patents.38 RPX does not actively assert patents.
Another firm that has been aggressive in asserting its patents, Qualcomm, has also suffered some
economic setbacks recently. China, being the location of manufacture of a large share of the
world’s handsets, is the source of about one half of Qualcomm revenue.39 One of the three
agencies in China responsible for enforcing the Chinese Anti-Monopoly Law (AML), the
NDRC, accused Qualcomm of violating the AML. Qualcomm paid a fine of almost one billion
dollars. Some analysts believe that Qualcomm violated the AML by not making licenses for its
communication SEPs available on FRAND terms. Other analysts believe that the NDRC
intervened to help local firms obtain lower royalty rates in their negotiations with Qualcomm.
As part of the settlement, Qualcomm agreed to make a number of changes to its licensing
practices and to lower its royalty rate by 35%.40 The non-price changes include no tying of SEPS
to non-SEPs, no required reciprocal licenses, and not basing the royalty on the final price of the
handset.41
In 2013, Intellectual Ventures (IV), a very large PAE, began a series of 13 lawsuits against large
financial institutions. These cases continued into 2014.42 Capital One prevailed in April 2014
when Judge Anthony Trenga dismissed IV’s lawsuit. Judge Trenga took the additional step of
invalidating all remaining patents in IV’s litigation, claiming that “IV’s patents were simply
abstract ideas.”43 This nullification of IV’s patents foreshadowed the conclusion of Alice v. CLS
Bank, which strictly limited patents on business methods and software.44 It seems likely that the
value of many PAE holdings will be reduced by the Alice ruling, particularly to the extent that
those holdings contained software and business method patents.
In February 2014, IV cut five percent of its workforce, most of whom were “attorneys and
engineers who worked for IV’s large patent acquisition funds.”45 In August 2014, IV reduced its
workforce by an additional 20 percent (roughly 140 people of its 700 employee workforce).46

Page 10

Co-founder and CTO Edward Jung characterized these layoffs as a natural part of IV’s evolution
as, after getting IV’s patent funds up and running, the company needed fewer people to “sort
through patents, acquire them covertly, think up complementary ideas, and deal with the
associated paperwork,”47 An alternative explanation is that the returns to being a PAE have
fallen, causing the firm to reduce the scale of its activities.
Meanwhile, Intellectual Ventures has been publicly promoting two new strategies which follow
the pro-competitive narrative for PAEs.48 The first is invention by IV itself. “Critics who only
saw IV as a giant IP collector misjudged the company, he [Jung] says. It will soon be pumping
out dozens of revolutionary products.”49 The IV Invention Lab has spun out several firms,
including TerraPower (nuclear power), Kymeta (satellites), and Evolv Technologies (image
detection).50
Secondly, IV has a new program, Intellectual Venture’s Invention Network (IVIN), which may
help individual inventors monetize patents while also helping IV acquire more patents. The
network promises to bring individual inventors and their patents into “a network of thousands of
inventors who get paid for their ideas.” Here is some key language from the IVIN website:51


“Whether you’re working alone in your garage or collaborating at one of our
participating institutions, IV’s inventor network offers you access to an extensive
information database which includes detailed analyses of important markets, products,
and technologies. You can also enjoy inventor community benefits such the sharing of
ideas and mentoring.”



“Beyond upfront payment and patenting of selected ideas, inventors share profits and
downstream royalties generated from licensing and commercialization”



“For selected inventions, we help fund the costs of securing worldwide protection. This
may include patenting fees, marketing, research and proof-of-concept work, and
commercialization — which can exceed US$50,000 per invention.”



“Our international reach enables us to maximize the value of your invention by bundling
it with other inventions from around the world.”

Intellectual Ventures invites inventors to join and submit their patents, writing: “Have a patent to
sell? When your invention is purchased by IV, we’ll give it global reach. Submit your patent to us

and we’ll respond with a fair valuation.”52 It remains to be seen whether there are productive
inventors who wish to participate in the network.53
The setbacks faced by PAEs may have caused the recent decline in PAE litigation, but the level
of PAE litigation remains very high by historical standards, and the prospect of juries awarding
very large damages, possibly disproportionate to the patent holder’s social contribution, remains.
In February 2015, a jury in Tyler, Texas ruled against Apple and awarded Smartflash, a classic
PAE, $533 million for willful infringement by Apple iTunes of three of its seven patents related
to data storage and payment management.54 Apple continues to insist that it invented the
disputed technology and has indicated that it plans to appeal. We do not know the details of the
specific patent claims or damages calculations in that case, but there is little doubt that Apple
makes for an attractive target given its enormous revenues. Smartflash has already filed a second
lawsuit against Apple as well as cases against Google, HTC, and Samsung.

C. Legislative Attempts to Reduce the Cost of Litigation
Patent reform is one of all-too-few areas in economic policy where truly bipartisan legislation
seems possible in today’s polarized political environment. The American Invents Act was very
much a bipartisan effort, passing the Senate 95-5 and the House 304-117.55
Now, there is bipartisan interest in Congress in passing legislation designed to control what are
seen as abuses of the patent litigation system, especially by PAEs. In December 2013, H.R.
3309, the “Innovation Act,” introduced by Representative Goodlatte, passed the House 325-91.56
Several Senators introduced similar legislation during 2013, but the Senate did not move on
patent reform in 2014.57 Many observers now expect that legislation similar to H.R. 3309 is
likely to become law in 2015. Representative Goodlatte re-introduced H.R. 3309 as H.R. 9 in
February 2015. The provisions contained in the new H.R. 9 provide an excellent guide to the
types of reforms most likely to be enacted in 2015. Here are some of the key provisions.

However, submitting an invention to IVIN grants IV “a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual,
irrevocable and sublicenseable license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, or publicly display” that information. 53
An inventor must agree to this condition before revealing the details of his or her invention for consideration by IV.

Page 12

Fee Shifting: H.R. 9 calls for the losing party in a patent case to pay the reasonable fees and
other expenses incurred by the prevailing party “unless the court finds that the position and
conduct of the non-prevailing party or parties were reasonably justified in law and fact or that
special circumstances (such as severe economic hardship to a named inventor) make an award
unjust.” This is a change from current law, which only calls for the prevailing party to be
awarded fees in “exceptional cases.”58
Shielding Final Customers: Some PAEs have adopted the strategy of suing (or threatening to
sue) final customers who purchase and use a product for patent infringement rather than the
manufacturer of the allegedly infringing device. The MPHJ Technology Investments case
described above is one (striking) example. This tactic, which has much in common with
nuisance suits, is designed to induce many final customers to pay royalties rather than face the
costs of defending a patent infringement case. H.R. 9 would require courts to allow
manufacturers to intervene as co-defendants in any patent infringement suit brought against their
customers and to put on hold the infringement suit against a customer so long as the customer
agrees to be bound by the judgment entered against the manufacturer.
Heightened Pleading Requirements: Currently, some patent holders bringing infringement cases
provide very little information on just what products are allegedly infringing the patents in suit or
on the basis for the infringement allegation. H.R. 9 would require the patent holder’s initial
pleading to provide more detail on the claims that are infringed, the specific product, feature,
method or process that is alleged to infringe those claims, and more.
Ownership Transparency: The bill would require plaintiffs to disclose to the USPTO, the parties,
and the court much more about the parties who are bringing the litigation and who have a
financial interest in the litigation. Plaintiffs would have to disclose the owner of the patent, the
party with the right to enforce the patent, any party with a financial interest in the patent or the
plaintiff, and the parent company of those parties.
Limitations on Discovery: Likewise, under current law each party in a patent dispute bears the
cost of providing evidence in its possession to the opposing party. H.R. 9 would maintain this
approach for “core documentary evidence,” but require the requesting party to pay to cost of
producing all evidence outside this category. This addresses the asymmetry that arises when a
PAE patent infringement case against a target company causes substantial discovery costs on the
target company but much smaller costs for the PAE.
Right now, there appears to be a very good chance that a bill similar to H.R. 9 will be passed by
Congress and signed by President Obama in 2015.59 Legislation along these lines would
meaningfully reduce patent assertions that are currently profitable primarily because of the
litigation costs they can impose on target firms who do not settle. Put differently, legislation
along these lines would go a long way to eliminating “patent nuisance suits.” Since the returns
to such suits have little if any relation to patent quality, reducing the returns associated with this
58

As discussed below, in 2014 the Supreme Court addressed fee shifting in patent cases in a pair of cases.

59

Legislation very similar to H.R. 9 was introduced in late April 2015 in the Senate Judiciary Committee by
Chairman Chuck Grassley together with Ranking Member Senator Patrick Leahy. This legislation, the Protecting
American Talent and Entrepreneurship Act (PATENT Act) seeks to clarify pleading standards, protect end users,
limit early discovery, enable more fee shifting, curb abusive demand letters, and increase transparency regarding
patent ownership.

type of patent assertion would lead to better overall alignment of rewards and contributions.
Increased transparency of the parties with a financial interest in patent assertions, along with
financial incentives relating to fee shifting, might well help create a better-functioning market for
intellectual property rights.

D. White House Proposals to Reduce the Cost of Patent Litigation
Less than two years after President Obama signed the AIA, the White House called for “bold
legislative action” to “protect innovators from frivolous litigation and ensure the highest quality
patents in our system.”60 The White House simultaneously released a report entitled “Patent
Assertion and U.S. Innovation,” which emphasized that PAE activity harms innovation and
economic growth.61 This report concluded:
Thus, the best approach to resolving today’s patent troll problem is not to ban firms specialized in patent
assertion, but rather to reduce the extent to which legal rules allow patent owners to capture a
disproportionate share of returns to investment. We see three main areas for improvement: clearer patents
with a high standard of novelty and non-obviousness, reduced disparity of litigation costs between patent
owners and technology users, and greater adaptability of the innovation system to challenges posed by new
technologies and new business models. [citations omitted]

The White House made seven legislative recommendations.62 Two of these recommendations
are quite similar to provisions found in H.R. 9. One recommendation is to “permit more
discretion in awarding fees to prevailing parties in patent cases” to serve “as a sanction for
abusive court filings.” A second recommendation is to “protect off-the-shelf use by consumers
and businesses by providing them with better legal protection against liability for a product being
used off-the-shelf and solely for its intended use.”63
The White House also announced five executive actions, four of which involve the PTO.64

E. U.S. Patent & Trademark Office Actions to Raise Patent Quality
Following the lead of the White House, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) has
undertaken a number of “Executive Actions on High Tech Patent Issues.”65 We comment here
on the PTO executive actions relating to patent quality and transparency.
In 2013, the PTO attempted to require patent owners to disclose themselves to the public through
registering patent ownership changes with the PTO. The reasoning was that this would make it

Two recommendations relate to the International Trade Commission, which we discuss below. Two directly
involve the PTO, which is discussed immediately below. The final recommendation is to “use demand letter
transparency to help curb abusive suits.” This last recommendation relates to the FTC’s enforcement action against
MPHJ discussed above.

The fifth executive action is to strengthen the enforcement process for ITC exclusion orders.

more difficult for PAEs to “ambush” implementers, make it easier for implementers to seek out
patent holders from whom they want a license, and make it clear what blocking technologies
already exist for a firm looking to enter a technological area. This effort failed due to objections
from patent owners who prefer their holdings to remain secret.
The PTO is revising its patent Assignment Database to make it easier to search. But submission
of ownership information to that database remains voluntary. We are skeptical that this
voluntary approach will generate the transparency benefits identified by the PTO, especially for
PAEs, some of which go to great lengths to conceal information about the patents they own.66
Our understanding is that mandatory submission of ownership information would require
legislation.
The PTO’s executive action on “Clarity in Patent Claims” could significantly improve patent
quality. The goal of this action is to more clearly define the boundaries of patents. If successful,
this action would allow implementers to avoid inadvertent patent infringement and reduce patent
litigation. Improving clarity in patent claims and tightening functional claiming is a major
ongoing project at the PTO. Currently, it is far too early to tell what its impact will be.
The PTO’s executive action “Crowdsourcing Prior Art,” also is promising but as yet unproven.
Currently, the PTO is evaluating the process by which patent examiners receive information
about prior art from third parties.
In February 2015, the PTO issued a Request for Comments on Enhancing Patent Quality.67 In
March 2015, the PTO held a two-day “Patent Quality Summit” to discuss its proposals to
improve patent quality. This is a promising initiative in its early stages. As noted above,
improving the quality of newly issued patents can only gradually reduce the costs associated with
low-quality patents, given the large stock of patents that have already been issued.

F. Supreme Court Decisions Lower Returns from Improper Assertion
The 2013-14 term at the Supreme Court included one decision that promises to have a dramatic
impact on PAEs, and several others that shift the balance in patent litigation modestly away from
patent holders. Perhaps just as important, in series of unanimous decisions, the Supreme Court
signaled that the specialized appeals courts that handles patents, the Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit (CAFC) had veered badly off course. The Supreme Court made it crystal clear
that the CAFC had departed from Supreme Court precedent and improperly constructed a set of
rules regarding patent litigation that were overly favorable to patent holders.68 In this sense, the

66

Ewing and Feldman (2012) document 1276 shell companies used by Intellectual Ventures. IV has acknowledged
that it uses shell companies to purchase and hold patents. In comments filed with the PTO, IV has stated that it
seeks to keep some of its patent holdings secret so as not to reveal its “technology roadmap.” See
http://www.uspto.gov/patents/law/comments/ao-e_intellectualventures_20140424.pdf.
67

See http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-02-05/pdf/2015-02398.pdf.

68

The Supreme Court clearly was in no mood to defer to the specialized court established to handle patent litigation.
For example, in Limelight v. Akamai 134 S. Ct. 2111 (2014), the Supreme Court wrote: “The Federal Circuit’s
analysis fundamentally misunderstands what it means to infringe a method patent.”

Page 15

Supreme Court complemented the White House and Congress in pushing back against
excessively broad and vague patents as well as patent litigation abuses.69
1. Alice: Abstract Ideas Put on a Computer are not Patentable
The biggest patent case of the 2013-14 term at the Supreme Court was unquestionably Alice vs.
CLS Bank, 134 S. Ct. 2347 (2014). This case involved a patent covering intermediated
settlement in financial markets that uses a computer system to track the balances of different
trading parties, only executing if both parties to the trade have sufficient funds. The unanimous
decision states: “We hold that the claims at issue are drawn to the abstract idea of intermediated
settlement, and that merely requiring generic computer implementation fails to transform that
abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.” The Supreme Court emphasized that it was
merely following precedent going back 150 years, under which “laws of nature, natural
phenomena, and abstract ideas are not patentable.”70 The Supreme Court explained that “laws of
nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas are the basic tools of scientific and technological
work,” and that “monopolization of those tools through the grant of a patent might tend to
impede innovation more than it would tend to promote it” and thus be contrary to the goal of the
patent laws as specified in the Constitution.
The Supreme Court stated explicitly that “the method claims, which merely require generic
computer implementation, fail to transform that abstract idea [intermediated settlement] into a
patent-eligible invention.”71 This is the critical teaching from Alice: patent claims that combine
an abstract idea with a computer implementation that is not itself inventive are not patentable.
Many observers believe that Alice sounds the death knell for all or virtually all business methods
patents and a great many software patents. If this proves to be the case, the Supreme Court will
have dramatically reduced the existing stock of patents that can effectively be asserted in the
information technology sector. So far, indications are that Alice is indeed having a dramatic
effect on business method patents and software patents. A PAE now faces a much greater
likelihood that its patent will be invalidated in court. Even more important in the short term,
defendants in patent infringement cases are having considerable success in having their cases
dismissed on the grounds that the patent claims asserted against them cover subject matter that is
not patentable after Alice.72 The PTO (2014) has already issued new guidelines to examiners

69

While the 2014-15 Supreme Court term will not compare with the dramatic 2013-14 Term, it has already yielded
one major patent case in which the Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit. In Teva Pharmaceuticals USA v.
Sandoz, 135 S. Ct. 831 (2015), the Court ruled 7-2 that the Federal Circuit could only overrule the trial court’s
construction of a patent claim if the lower court had committed a “clear error.” Under Teva, the Federal Circuit role
in claim construction is significantly diminished in comparison with the previous de novo review standard the CAFC
had established for itself.
70

134 S. Ct. 2354, quoting Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics 133 S. Ct. 2107 (2013). In
Myriad the Court found that isolated human genes were not patentable subject matter. The Court also cited Bilski v.
Kappos, 561 U.S. 593 (2010) and Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, 132 S. Ct. 1289 (2012).
Bilski involved a method of hedging and Mayo involved a medical diagnostic method. One of the key precedents
here goes all the way back to the invention of the telegraph, O’Reilly v. Morse 56 U.S. 62 (1854), where the
Supreme Court found certain claims in Morse’s patent to be overly broad.

applications from allowance following the new guidelines.73
2. Octane Fitness: Fee Shifting to PAEs is made Easier
The Supreme Court also dramatically reversed the Federal Circuit regarding the circumstances
under which the losing party in a patent litigation can be required to pay the legal fees of the
prevailing party. The Federal Circuit had made fee shifting in patent cases virtually impossible,
requiring that the prevailing party establish that the losing party acted with “subjective bad faith”
and that the losing party’s case was “objectively baseless.” In a pair of decisions, a unanimous
Supreme Court brushed aside the Federal Circuit’s standard, making it far easier for the
prevailing party to establish the “exceptional circumstances” under which fee shifting is
permitted by the Patent Act.74 The Court said it would be sufficient to show that the losing party
made unusually weak arguments or engaged in litigation strategy abuses. The Court also
lowered the burden of proof required for the trial judge to make such a finding. Plus, lest there
be any doubt that the Supreme Court was telling the Federal Circuit to back off, the Supreme
Court ruled that the Federal Circuit could only reverse the trial judge’s award of fees to the
prevailing party if the trial judge abused his or her discretion, greatly limiting the role of the
Federal Circuit in comparison with the de novo review standard that the Federal Circuit had
previously applied.
With these two decisions, the Supreme Court has probably gone about as far as it can to reign in
abusive patent litigation tactics through fee shifting, given that the statute confines fee shifting to
“exceptional circumstances.” Note that the new H.R. 9 would go considerably further by
creating a presumption that the losing party in a patent case pays the fees of the prevailing party.
3. Medtronic: Declaratory Judgment Actions
Patent holders generally decide whether, when, and against whom to assert their patents by
initiating a patent infringement action. This can be problematic for an implementer that believes
it is not infringing a given patent but does not want to make specific investments that would
suffer capital losses if its products or services are later found to infringe. Declaratory judgment
actions thus help align patentee reward and contribution by limiting patent hold-up.
Patent law provides a mechanism for an implementer to press the issue and obtain a judicial
determination as to whether or not it is indeed infringing a valid patent: by filing a declaratory
judgment action. In MedImmune vs. Genentech 549 U.S. 118 (2007), the Supreme Court
reversed the Federal Circuit and ruled that an implementer who has signed a patent license could
file a declaratory judgment action. In this manner, the implementer can pay royalties and avoid
patent infringement while having the matter resolved in court.
However, the Federal Circuit had placed an obstacle in front of an implementer filing a
declaratory judgment action: the burden of proving infringement would shift from the patent
holder (who bears this burden when bringing a patent infringement action) to the implementer.
In Medtronic v. Mirowski, 134 S. Ct. 843 (2014), the Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit
and held that this burden remains with the patent holder. The Medtronic case is a useful step to

facilitate the earlier determination of whether a patent is valid and infringed. As explored by
Lemley and Shapiro (2007), Farrell and Shapiro (2008), and Shapiro (2010), there are efficiency
benefits of making such determinations before implementers make specific investments.
4. Nautilus: Patent Quality and Clarity of Claims
Many observers have expressed concerns that the claims in many software patents are vague,
making it hard for implementers to determine whether or not they are likely to be found
infringing. Menell (2014) nicely articulates this problem and proposes solutions.
Yet again, the Supreme Court found that the Federal Circuit had leaned too far in favor of patent
holders. In Nautilus Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc. 134 S. Ct. 2120 (2014), the Supreme Court
significantly altered the standard under which patent claims would be found overly vague and
thus invalid.
The Federal Circuit had established a very lenient standard: a claim was considered clear enough
so long as it was not “insolubly ambiguous.” In other words, if there existed any way to clarify
the claim and make it definite, the claim would withstand challenged. The Supreme Court
dismissed this extreme approach, ruling that a patent claim is indefinite “if the claim fails to
inform, with reasonable certainty, those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention.” This
decision is likely to have a major impact on how patent claims are drafted, improving patent
quality and reducing the amount of patent litigation.

4. Standard Essential Patents
A. Background
We now discuss problems that have arisen regarding patents that are essential to compliance with
product standards, so-called “Standard-Essential Patents” (SEPs). Standard-Setting
Organizations, or SSOs, have established procedures by which they choose a technological path
for a standard. Because that path might involve patented innovations, the SSO also will typically
have an Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) policy. If the standard cannot be implemented without
practicing (using) a particular patent, that patent is said to be an SEP. The IPR policy of an SSO
articulates what member firms must disclose concerning their patents that may be essential and
also what licensing obligations members must commit to should they have any SEPs. The usual
licensing commitment of an SSO requires what are known as FRAND terms. FRAND refers to
Fair, Reasonable, And Non-Discriminatory.
SSOs create or enhance market power by the joint action of their members in limiting
competition among technologies and instead agreeing on a single standard, typically one in
which several or many members hold IPRs. This joint action can be acceptable for society
because it trades off technology competition against the potentially speedy adoption of one
efficient standard – provided the SSO limits the ex post license terms for SEPs so as to constrain
the exercise of the substantial market power necessarily enjoyed by the owner of an SEP in a
successful standard. However, SSOs typically specify very little as to the meaning of the words
“fair” or “reasonable” in the FRAND commitment. This is perhaps partially because of
uncertainty about future demand and costs, but also because some of their members gain from
ambiguity in the meaning of FRAND.

Page 18

The root cause of many problems in the SEP market described below is this vague nature of the
FRAND commitments. If the FRAND commitment contained more detail on what actions and
rights were permitted or forbidden, the upper range of demands would shrink, thereby making it
more difficult for a patent holder to engage in holdup.75 However, SSOs operate by consensus
and typical have at least some members who profit from the status quo. Those members can use
due process within the organization to slow or block reform. Tactics include filibustering
discussions and votes, requiring subcommittees to engage in extensive study, and organizing or
purchasing allies to vote against reform. Dysfunction of FRAND enforcement has been noted by
policy makers for many years. In January 2013, the DOJ and the PTO issued a joint policy
statement regarding SEPs.76 The National Research Council recently released a detailed study
of the intellectual property rules of a number of standard-setting organizations, including a series
of recommendations for SSO and government policies.77
Somewhat surprisingly, standard-essential patents fare significantly less well when litigated in
Federal court than do other patents. When asserting SEPs in Federal Court, patents holders
prevailed approximately 29% of the time, far lower than the 68% win rate for non-SEPs.78

B. IEEE Sharpens the Definition of FRAND
There had been little progress at major SSOs in clarifying just what a FRAND commitment
entails until February 2015, when the IEEE became the first major SSO to successfully reform its
IPR policy. The proposed changes to the IEEE IPR Policy were approved at three different
levels of committees and then finally by the IEEE Board of Governors.79 The IEEE reforms have
several important components.80 Together, these reforms substantially impact two of the three
categories of patent assertion costs, namely patent damages and injunctions.
1. The FRAND Commitment Travels with the Patent
The new IEEE IPR policy requires that the FRAND commitment remains binding when the
patent is sold. In the absence of this requirement, a successful business strategy would be to
agree to FRAND and then later sell the patents to a licensor who thought that he was not so
bound. This reform protects the integrity of the FRAND commitment, thereby limiting patent
damage awards and injunctions based on SEPS, by increasing the number of FRANDencumbered patents and thus protecting more implementers who relied upon the FRAND
commitment.

67% respectively. These data include all patent infringement actions brought in U.S. district courts from January
2005 through June 2014. The most recent outcome at verdict, initial determination or final determination is counted.

Page 19

Like many other observers, we have been perplexed as to why it took so long for the IEEE to
clarify that the FRAND commitment “travels with the patent,” and why other major SSOs have
not already adopted a similar provision into their IPR policies.
2. No Bundling of Non-SEPs with SEPs
The new IEEE IPR policy prohibits the owner of SEPs from bundling them with other IPRs as a
condition of licensing those SEPs. Parties may choose broad cross licensing voluntarily, but it
may not be a requirement. The SEP owner is required to offer a simple license covering all of
the SEPs that read on a given standard. This change protects a licensee from bundling or tying
that might raise a royalty rate above the FRAND level or otherwise enable evasion of the
FRAND commitment.
3. Clarification of What Constitutes a “Reasonable” Royalty Rate
Importantly, IEEE takes a stand on defining what constitutes a “reasonable” royalty rate. In
particular, the first paragraph below states that the value associated with a patent claim excludes
the value resulting from the inclusion of that claim’s technology in the standard. This principle
has been advanced by the U.S. competition agencies for many years because it eliminates holdup
and associated inefficiencies.81 The text of the new IEEE policy is reproduced below:
“‘Reasonable Rate’ shall mean appropriate compensation to the patent holder for the practice
of an Essential Patent Claim excluding the value, if any, resulting from the inclusion of that
Essential Patent Claim’s technology in the IEEE Standard. In addition, determination of such
Reasonable Rates should include, but need not be limited to, the consideration of:


The value that the functionality of the claimed invention or inventive feature within
the Essential Patent Claim contributes to the value of the relevant functionality of the
smallest saleable Compliant Implementation that practices the Essential Patent Claim.



The value that the Essential Patent Claim contributes to the smallest saleable
Compliant Implementation that practices that claim, in light of the value contributed
by all Essential Patent Claims for the same IEEE Standard practiced in that
Compliant Implementation.



Existing licenses covering use of the Essential Patent Claim, where such licenses
were not obtained under the explicit or implicit threat of a Prohibitive Order, and
where the circumstances and resulting licenses are otherwise sufficiently comparable
to the circumstances of the contemplated license.”82

The three ‘optional’ bullets will presumably have influence on how courts interpret the term
“reasonable” in FRAND licensing under the IEEE policy. The first bullet helps cabin the
FRAND demand of a licensor by focusing attention on the value of the patented technology, for
example, the chip-set used in communications, and not the additional features of the handset or
game console or automobile. The second bullet focuses attention on the problem of “royalty
stacking.” Given that many standards have hundreds or even thousands of claimed SEPs, a
reasonable royalty must take this into account so that total payments of implementers remain

reasonable. The third bullet essentially says that licensors should not point to royalty rates
negotiated under the threat of an injunction and use them as a ‘competitive’ benchmark.
4. Limits on Seeking or Enforcing Injunctions
The new IEEE IPR policy makes a huge change in a second type of assertion cost by limiting the
use of injunction and exclusion orders:
“The Submitter of an Accepted LOA who has committed to make available a license for
one or more Essential Patent Claims agrees that it shall neither seek nor seek to enforce a
Prohibitive Order based on such Essential Patent Claim(s) in a jurisdiction unless the
implementer fails to participate in, or to comply with, the outcome of, an adjudication,
including an affirming first-level appellate review, if sought by any party within
applicable deadlines, in that jurisdiction by one or more courts that have the authority to:
determine Reasonable Rates and other reasonable terms and conditions; adjudicate patent
validity, enforceability, essentiality, and infringement; award monetary damages; and
resolve any defenses and counterclaims. In jurisdictions where the failure to request a
Prohibitive Order in a pleading waives the right to seek a Prohibitive Order at a later
time, a Submitter may conditionally plead the right to seek a Prohibitive Order to
preserve its right to do so later, if and when this policy’s conditions for seeking, or
seeking to enforce, a Prohibitive Order are met.”83
This policy means that as long as the implementer is complying with adjudication procedures
that will eventually produce appropriate monetary damages for the SEP holder, the SEP holder
may not pursue an injunction. Importantly, an implementer who thinks the patents are not valid,
not essential, or not infringed may pursue litigation on those grounds and be safe from the threat
of injunction until a determination has been made by a court or arbitrator. Note that an SEP
holder can still seek an injunction against an implementer that will not participate in a formal
system to resolve the licensing dispute, or who has a judgment against it that it refuses to pay.

Department of Justice Business Review Letter

In February 2015, the Antitrust Division issued a business review letter (BRL) regarding the
changes in the IEEE IPR policies.84 This business review letter is an important document
because it clarifies how the Department of Justice evaluates certain business practices associated
with SEPs. This BRL also explains the DOJ’s current thinking regarding SEPs and the FRAND
commitment, going well beyond the specifics of the IEEE policy.85 The DOJ BRL states
“The inherent ambiguity in the meaning of the terms ‘reasonable’ and
‘nondiscriminatory’ however, can limit the benefits of RAND licensing commitment.
Greater clarity and transparency may facilitate further the adoption and implementation
of standards, thereby increasing the benefits that consumers derive…”86

86

DOJ IEEE Business Review Letter, p. 6.

Page 21

Here we see a clear opinion from the Department of Justice that ambiguity regarding the
meaning of the FRAND commitment harms consumer welfare. This is not without import, as
there are PAEs whose position is that ambiguity preserves incentives to participate in the SSO
process. In a section entitled “Prohibitive Orders,” the DOJ BRL goes on to state:
“The threat of exclusion from a market is a powerful weapon that can enable a patent
owner to hold up implementers of a standard. Limiting this threat reduces the possibility
that a patent holder will take advantage of the inclusion of its patent in a standard to
engage in patent holdup.”87
In a section entitled “Reciprocity – Grantbacks,” the DOJ BRL also takes a general position
against the compulsory tying of SEPs to other patents.
“These prohibitions [on tying] will reduce the possibility that a holder of a RAND
encumbered patent could leverage that patent to force a cross-license of, among other
things, a potential licensee’s differentiating patents and limit the potential for
anticompetitive tying. A compulsory cross-license can, in some cases, decrease
incentives to innovate.”88
The letter goes on to make clear that voluntary cross licensing can be pro-competitive.
The Department of Justice’s business review letter of the new IEEE policy concludes with this
statement:
“The Department concludes that the Update has the potential to benefit competition and
consumers by facilitating licensing negotiations, mitigating hold up and royalty stacking,
and promoting competition among technologies for inclusion in standards. The
Department cannot conclude that the Update is likely to harm competition. Further, to
the extent that there are any potential competitive harms, the Department concludes that
the Update’s potential procompetitive benefits likely outweigh those harms.
Accordingly, the Department has no present intention to take antitrust enforcement action
against the conduct you have described.”89
In our experience, this is about as enthusiastic as the Department of Justice gets in its business
review letters.
6. Combined Impact at IEEE and Beyond
Together, the IEEE IPR policy changes are very substantial. They insure the permanence of the
FRAND commitment, prohibit tying using SEPs, and they sharply limit injunctions based on
SEPs. Furthermore, they provide substantial and guidance on what is meant by “reasonable
royalties,” including the requirement that royalty stacking be addressed and that value associated
with inclusion of a technology in the standard be excluded.
Taken as a whole, these changes promise to resolve many of the issues that have plagued SEPs in
recent years, to significantly reduce harm from holdup of SEPs if courts enforce them, and to
greatly reduce the amount of SEP-related litigation. These changes reflect some of the

recommendations made by the National Research Council in Maskus and Merrill (2013). The
elements of this list have been sought in the past by antitrust agencies and economists.90
We see substantial advantages of the new IEEE IPR policy in terms of innovation and consumer
benefits. Properly implemented, these new policies allow the owners of patents that cover
fundamental technologies to be richly compensated when their patents are included in an IEEE
standard: the reasonable royalties per unit should reflect the ex ante incremental benefits of the
patented technology, which are substantial for a fundamental technology with no good
substitutes, and the number of units sold can be hugely increased through standardization. To
the extent that the reasonable royalties paid for any one party’s portfolio of SEPs are reduced by
considerations of royalty stacking, that involves splitting the aggregate royalties among SEP
owners, not reducing the aggregate level of royalties due to SEP owners.91 We are therefore
hopeful that many SEP owners as well as implementers will embrace these new policies, at the
IEEE and at other SSOs.
So far, however, these policies have only been adopted by a single major SSO, namely the IEEE.
An important policy question arising from the IEEE action is whether reform will extend to other
major SSOs, notably ETSI and the ITU. The European Commission has made it clear for a
number of years that it will take action to prevent the abuse of FRAND commitments. The
European Commission has filed cases against Samsung and Motorola over abuse of SEP
licensing and the violation of FRAND commitments.92 Nonetheless, we have found no official
reaction by ETSI or the ITU to the IEEE reform. Nor have we detected any hint of change at
ETSI or at the ITU; industry sources confirm that parties who oppose changes along the lines of
those implemented by the IEEE have enough votes in both organizations to block similar
reforms. This means that a substantial fraction of the flow of new SEPs will continue to feature
vague FRAND commitments. Indeed, firms whose business model involves the monetization of
SEPs may cease to participate in IEEE, and instead take their technology to SSOs whose
demands are less consumer-friendly. For example, just a few days after the IEEE reform,
Qualcomm announced that it would not comply with the new IEEE IPR policy:
“Qualcomm will continue to submit information that could be considered for inclusion in
the standard, but it will set its own royalty commitment similar to the old rules, said
Fabian Gonell, chief lawyer of Qualcomm’s licensing business. ‘IEEE has approved
standards even when companies have refused to make precise commitments,’ he said.
‘Since they say they’re not going to force anyone, we’re going to hold them to that.’”93
A similar statement was made by InterDigital on March 24, 2015:

90

See Kuhn, Kai-Uwe, Fiona Scott Morton, and Howard Shelanski (2013) “Standard Setting Organizations Can Help
Solve the Standard Essential Patents Licensing Problem” CPI Antitrust Chronicle, March 2013 (special issue) as
well as the DOJ/FTC joint IP guidelines. See also Farrell, et. al, (2007).
91

Indeed, since SEPs are Cournot Complements, an IPR policy preventing patent hold-up helps overcome the
problem of supra-monopoly pricing associated with complementary inputs used in fixed proportions.

“In a nutshell, we advised the IEEE that our company objects to their entirely new policy on
patents and, going forward, on a case-by-case basis, will provide alternative licensing
assurances to those specified in the 2015 policy.”94

This dynamic will be very interesting to watch going forward. If the IEEE accepts commitments
from patent holders that depart from its new policies and ex ante allow patent hold-up, the IEEE
would open itself to the criticism that it is acting like a technology cartel rather than a welfareenhancing organization. This could create antitrust liability for the IEEE and its members. On
the other hand, if the IEEE stands by its new IPR policy and refuses to accept weaker
commitments than called for under that policy, how will Qualcomm, InterDigital, and other firms
seeking to monetize their SEPs respond? We will soon see whether they withdraw their
technologies altogether from future Wi-Fi standards, decamp to a different SSO, or agree to
abide by the new IEEE IPR policy. Stay tuned.

C. Enforcement and Guidance from the FTC and DOJ
The Federal Trade Commission has taken two recent enforcement actions against SEP hold-up.
The first case was against Bosch, a maker of automotive technology, among other businesses.
The patents in question were owned by a firm being acquired by Bosch, SPX, and are relevant to
two refrigeration standards.95 The FTC analysis described the problem as “SPX’s suit for
injunctive relief against implementers of its standard essential patents constitutes a failure to
license its standard-essential patents under the FRAND terms it agreed to while participating in
the standard setting process, and is an unfair method of competition actionable under Section 5
of the FTC Act.”96 Notice that the FTC chose to pursue the conduct under the Section 5 of the
FTC Act, the “unfair competition” statute, and not under the Sherman Act.
In settling the case brought by the FTC, Bosch agreed to offer a royalty-free license to all
implementers desiring to manufacture the devices at issue, and to no longer seek injunctions
unless “the third party refuses in writing to license the patent consistent with the letter of
assurance, or otherwise refuses to license the patent on terms that comply with the letter of
assurance as determined by a process agreed upon by both parties (e.g., arbitration) or a court.”
The second case brought by the FTC involved Motorola, then owned by Google. This case also
involved a patent holder, Motorola, seeking an exclusion order based on FRAND-encumbered
SEPs. As in the Bosch case, the FTC Complaint describes Motorola’s behavior as violating
Section 5 of the FTC Act.
“Google and Motorola’s conduct constitute an unfair method of competition and harms
competition by threatening to undermine the integrity and efficiency of the standardsetting process. … Motorola’s conduct threatens to increase prices and reduce the quality

of products on the market and to deter firms from entering the market. Moreover,
Motorola’s conduct threatens to deny consumers the many procompetitive benefits that
standard setting makes possible.97
The FTC settlement with Google required that Google resolve any disputes over the correct
FRAND rate through courts or binding arbitration without recourse to injunctions, except under
certain limited circumstances.
Like the FTC, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice has long been concerned about
standard-essential patents. Notably, in 2007 the DOJ and the FTC, issued a major report,
“Antitrust Enforcement and Intellectual Property Rights: Promoting Innovation and
Competition,” in which Chapter 2 was entitled “Competition Concerns When Patents are
Incorporated into Collaboratively Set Standards.” More recently, Deputy Assistant Attorney
General Renata Hesse, one of the current leaders of the Antitrust Division, has given a number of
speeches describing the DOJ’s efforts to encourage standard-setting organizations to voluntarily
change the way in which they handle SEPs.98 These speeches also emphasize the long-standing
efforts by DOJ to educate the USTR, the PTO, the ITC and other parts of the government, as
well as SSOs themselves, about the competitive problems caused by SEP hold-up. Top officials
from the Antitrust Division have expressed their hope that voluntary reform by SSOs will
obviate the need for the DOJ to take antitrust enforcement action.99
However, with the notable exception of the IEEE, this voluntary approach based on persuasion
has yet to induce major SSOs to make significant changes to their IPR policies. Overall, based on
experience to date, it seems likely that publicizing DOJ’s opinions will have little or no impact
on the behavior of the most aggressive SEP holders in the absence of steps that materially change
their incentives. At some point, the DOJ may need to pivot from offering guidance to taking
enforcement actions. Of course, the DOJ can only bring an enforcement action if a suitable case
comes to its attention. Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides the Antitrust Division with a
powerful tool if the DOJ can establish that an SSO’s vague or weak IPR polices constitute an
agreement among competitors that limits technology competition and enriches the participants
who own SEPs at the expense of consumers by allowing or enabling patent hold-up. Section 2 of
the Sherman Act provides the Antitrust Division with another powerful tool, given the market
power inherent in an SEP associated with a successful standard. With a suitable fact pattern, a
DOJ enforcement action, likely combined with private antitrust cases seeking treble damages,

See, for example, Hesse (2013). “How can we address this problem? One way is through post hoc antitrust suits
against holders of F/RAND-encumbered SEPs who try to engage in patent hold-up. The Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) and the European Commission (EC) have demonstrated that this approach can be successful in some cases,
and several recent decisions from U.S. courts have provided substantial guidance in this area. But, post hoc litigation
also can be costly and time-consuming. A more efficient solution would rely on collaboration within the standards
industry to improve patent policies at standards bodies.” (page 4) “In sum, I believe the Division’s competition
advocacy, in combination with the efforts of other agencies and the courts, is bringing some much-needed guidance
to the issues posed by standards-essential patents that patent owners have committed to license on F/RAND terms.
We will continue our work in this area with the hope that the policies governing the use of such standards-essential
patents will become even more procompetitive.”

could provide a powerful incentive for other SSOs to make reforms along the lines of the recent
IEEE IPR policy changes.

D. Transparent Trading of Rights to Practice SEPs
In March 2013 the Antitrust Division issued an important business review letter to Intellectual
Property Exchange International (IPXI).100 This letter further explains how the Department or
Justice views licensing issues associated with SEPs.
IPXI describes itself as “the world’s first financial exchange that facilitates non-exclusive
licensing and trading of intellectual property (IP) rights with market-based pricing and
standardized terms.”101 These standardized terms are embodied in “unit license rights” (ULRs),
which are traded on the IPXI exchange. “Each purchaser of a ULR contract is granted the right
to use the underlying technology for a pre-established number of instances (the technology
unit).”102 For example, IPXI is currently offering a ULR contract for a portfolio of 194 patents
that cover technologies used in wireless chipsets that comply with the IEEE 802.11n standard,
which provides higher throughput for Wi-Fi access. These SEPs have been contributed by eight
sponsors, including Mitsubishi, Sony, Philips, and the University of California.103 Each ULR
grants the purchaser the right to make, use and sell 1000 wireless chipsets.
Since its business model involves packing together patents from multiple owners in a novel way,
IPXI sought a business review letter from the DOJ. The DOJ responded by writing: “Due to
inherent uncertainties and potential competitive concerns associated with IPXI’s novel business
model that are discussed in detail below, the Department declines to state its present
enforcement intentions regarding IPXI’s proposal at this time.” Nevertheless, the DOJ letter is
quite informative, especially regarding SEPs.
The DOJ letter recognized that the pooling of SEPs from multiple patent holders could generate
efficiencies. “IPXI’s platform for pooled ULRs has the potential to generate additional
efficiencies by reducing the time and expense of acquiring and disseminating all the pooled
patents to potential licensees, reducing the amount of stacked royalties, clearing blocking
positions, and integrating technologies that are necessary to practice an industry standard or field
of use.”104 The DOJ also speaks approvingly of IPXI’s ULRs that pool SEPs, including IPXI’s
requirement that patent holders provide an independent expert’s opinion that the patents are
indeed essential to compliance with the standard. “IPXI’s definition of essentiality is consistent
with other definitions of ‘essentiality’ that the Department has favorably reviewed to exclude
substitute patents from a pool to implement a technical standard.”105
In the two years since DOJ sent its business review letter to IPXI, IPXI has moved forward with
its exchange. While it is too soon to say how successful IPXI will be, it promises to offer

enhanced transparency and liquidity in the licensing of patents, and what could be a convenient
and efficient mechanism to pool SEPs to help overcome problems associated with royalty
stacking. The prices coming out of the IPXI exchange may also serve as benchmarks for other
patents for the purpose of determining FRAND royalty levels.

E. The International Trade Commission as an Outlier
During the past decade, patent owners increasingly turned to the International Trade
Commission, seeking to obtain exclusion orders that prevent the importation of infringing
products. The peak of this activity was reached in 2011: RPX (2015, p. 13) reports that number
of initiated ITC Section 337 investigations peaked at 67 in 2011 and has been steady at 37 or 38
during 2012, 2013, and 2014. The ITC opened 39 new investigations related to patent disputes
in 2012, 43 in 2013, and 41 in 2013.106 At the end of 2014, there were 111 pending ITC
investigations relate to patent disputes.107
Standard-essential patents fare significantly better when they are asserted before the ITC than
when they are litigated in Federal court. When asserting SEPs before the ITC, patent holders
prevail 49% of the time, compared with only 29% of the time in Federal court.108
In addition to the higher win rate for owners of SEPs, the ITC offers two significant advantages
to patent owners in comparison with brining a patent infringement action in Federal court: the
ITC process is significantly faster, and an exclusion order issued by the ITC is far more costly to
the target firm than the most likely remedy in Federal court, the awarding of damages to the
patent holder equal to reasonable royalties.
As noted above, the Supreme Court’s 2006 decision in eBay established conditions under which
a patent holder is entitled to a permanent injunction to stop another firm found to have infringed
its valid patent from continuing to infringe that patent.109 Under the eBay decision, it is very
difficult for a patent holder to obtain an injunction unless monetary damages are insufficient to
compensate the patent for the infringement. As Judge Posner forcefully explained, eBay implies
that patent holders who have made FRAND commitments generally cannot obtain injunctions.110
To begin with Motorola’s injunctive claim, I don’t see how, given FRAND, I would be justified in
enjoining Apple from infringing the ‘898 unless Apple refuses to pay a royalty that meets the FRAND
requirement. By committing to license its patents on FRAND terms, Motorola committed to license the
‘898 to anyone willing to pay a FRAND royalty and thus implicitly acknowledged that a royalty is
adequate compensation for a license to use that patent. How could it do otherwise?

On appeal, the Federal Circuit agreed with Judge Posner that Motorola should not receive an
injunction in this case, stating: “A patentee subject to FRAND commitments may have difficulty
establishing irreparable harm.”111
The Federal Trade Commission, applying similar logic to that used by Judge Posner and the
Federal Circuit, urged the ITC in 2012 not to grant exclusion orders on patents subject to
FRAND commitments, writing that “a royalty negotiation that occurs under threat of an
exclusion order may be weighted heavily in favor of the patentee in a way that is in tension with
the RAND commitment.112 In 2013, the DOJ and the PTO issued a joint policy statement urging
the ITC to be cautious about issuing exclusion orders related to FRAND-encumbered patents.113
Despite these urgings, in June 2013 the ITC went forward and awarded an exclusion order
related to a Samsung SEP which it found to be infringed by certain Apple smartphones and
tablets.114 In August 2013, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman disapproved (nullified)
that exclusion order. Citing the joint DOJ/PTO policy statement, he wrote: “The Policy
Statement expresses substantial concerns, which I strongly share, about the potential harms that
can result from owners of standards-essential patents (‘SEPs’) who have made a voluntary
commitment to offer to license on terms that are fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory
(‘FRAND’), gaining undue leverage and engaging in ‘patent hold-up.’”115
The reasons U.S. Trade Representative Froman disapproved the order are (a) there are other
remedies available to these patent holders, (b) there remains the possibility of an exclusion order
if the infringing party refuses to pay a royalty rate that has been determined to be FRAND, and
(c) an exclusion order is possible if the infringing party is not subject to the jurisdiction of the
Federal Courts. This balance is designed to limit patent hold-up by owners of SEPs while
allowing those patent holders to collect the reasonable royalties due to them. However, it is
worth noting that disapproval of an ITC order is under the control of the President (with
authority delegated to the Trade Representative) on a case by case basis and is not a general
policy. Moreover, the Froman Letter does not categorically state that exclusion orders based on
SEPs will be disapproved, and the ITC does not appear to have accepted the economic logic
underlying the statements by the FTC, DOJ, PTO, and the U.S. Trade Representative.
Indeed, the International Trade Commission appears to take the contrary view that a patent
holder must have the ability to threaten exclusion, even before a reasonable rate has been

possibility that an injunction may be warranted if the infringer refuses to pay a FRAND royalty.

http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/guidelines/290994.pdf. Like the Federal Circuit, the DOJ and PTO state that
exclusion orders may be appropriate if the putative licensee refuses to pay what has been determined to be a
FRAND royalty. They also state: “An exclusion order could be appropriate if the putative licensee is not subject to
the jurisdiction of a court that could award damages.” (p. 7)

determined, in order to receive a reasonable royalty rate in negotiations with an implementer.116
This is a markedly different conclusion than that drawn by the Supreme Court, the Department of
Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and other authorities on patents and competition. Judge
Posner, in his inimitable style, swiftly eviscerates the ITC’s apparent argument, writing: “You
can’t obtain an injunction for a simple breach of contract on the ground that you need the
injunction to pressure the defendant to settle your damages claim on terms more advantageous to
you than if there were no such pressure.”117
Despite Judge Posner’s compelling logic, the ITC appears to be exclusively focused on patent
hold-out rather than hold-up. The ITC InterDigital Decision affirmatively states that there is no
patent hold-up in this industry.
First, InterDigital is, by the terms of the ETSI policy agreement, entitled to be adequately
and fairly rewarded for its IP. There is no proof that they have been negotiating in bad
faith, and in fact it is the respondents that have taken advantage of the complainant
and manufactured, marketed, and profited on goods without taking a license to the IP at
issue. While there may be a hypothetical risk of holdup, we have evidence that it is not a
threat in this case, or in this industry.118
This factual assertion about the wireless telecommunications industry stands in stark contrast to
the conclusions reached by every other regulatory body in the United States, as discussed above.
The ITC InterDigital Case goes on to describe a world where implementers are seeking to avoid
paying reasonable royalties and, absent ITC action, will have a “safe haven, where they are free
to avoid their own obligations under the agreements.”119 Oddly, this statement entirely ignores
the remedies available to SEP owners through the Federal Courts under the Patent Act.
The Judge in the ITC InterDigital case appears to believe that implementers will be able to game
the system if exclusion orders are only available once a FRAND rate has been determined and
the implementer refuses to pay the FRAND royalties that are due to the patent owner. On this
point, it is important to distinguish two notions of what constitutes a “reasonable royalty.”
For the purposes of a FRAND determination, the reasonable royalty rate is the one that would be
negotiated between the SEP owner and the implementer prior to the inclusion of the technology
in the standard. These negotiations would recognize that the patent in question may in fact not
be valid and may not be infringed. We call this the “FRAND royalty rate.” In contrast, the
notion of a “reasonable royalty” for the purpose of calculating patent damages is the rate that
would be negotiated prior to the inclusion of the technology in the standard but assuming that the
patent is valid and infringed. The assumptions of validity and infringement are routinely made

for the purpose of calculating patent damages, because such damages only arise once a patent has
in fact been ruled valid and infringed. We call this the “patent damages royalty rate.”
As a general principle, not confined to SEPs, the patent damages royalty rate is greater than the
FRAND royalty rate, perhaps far greater, since the latter incorporates uncertainty about validity
and infringement. Since patent holders often lose when they bring infringement actions, the
FRAND royalty rate typically involves a substantial discount based on patent quality, i.e., the
probability that the patent will be found valid and infringed by the implementer in question.
Therefore, a target firm that refuses to pay a FRAND rate bears the risk that it will pay a much
higher patent damages royalty rate if the patent is ruled valid and infringed. This is true for SEPs
in the absence of ITC exclusion orders, just as it is true for all patents for which an injunction
will not be granted under eBay. The ITC InterDigital Case appears go astray by missing this
basic point.
At this point, the International Trade Commission remains a policy outlier regarding SEPs.
Unlike the ITC, the other agencies in the U.S. government correctly recognize that innovation
and consumer welfare is promoted by policies that confine injunctions and exclusion orders on
SEPs to circumstances in which the implementer has refused to pay a FRAND rate as determined
by a neutral authority. It remains to be seen whether the ITC will issue exclusion orders on SEPs
following the Froman disapproval letter. The White House has suggested that the ITC standard
for issuing exclusion orders be changed legislatively to better align it with the traditional fourfactor test from eBay that applies in the Federal Courts. 120 This would reduce uncertainty about
the circumstances under which the ITC will issue exclusion orders based on SEPs while better
aligning rewards and contributions for SEP owners.

F. Judicial Determination of FRAND Rates
In 2013, Judge Robart in the Western District of Washington ruled on the range of FRAND rates
for Motorola’s SEPs in order to determine whether Motorola had breached its contractual
commitment to offer a FRAND rate to Microsoft.121 Microsoft claimed that Motorola had
violated its commitment to the JEDEC, the applicable SSO, with an unreasonably high licensing
demand of $4 billion. The court found that the correct FRAND payment was $1.8 million, or less
than 0.1% of the original demand. These numbers illustrate well the problem with vagueness in
FRAND: the huge range of licensing demands that are possible ex post.
The Microsoft v. Motorola case was the first instance in the United States where a patent holder
was found to have breached a FRAND commitment. Judge Robart’s carefully reasoned decision
created precedent that is helping to make it more difficult for owners of SEPs to engage in patent
hold-up. However, progress along these lines appears to be limited due to the particular legal
stance of the Microsoft v. Motorola case. This case involved Microsoft suing Motorola under
Washington law as a third-party beneficiary of the JEDEC FRAND contract. This “contract law
approach” by an implementer such as Microsoft is only available for a subset of SSOs. For
example, the ITC has ruled that FRAND commitments under ETSI are interpreted under French

law and are very limited: “the [ETSI] agreement is not a contract itself, but rather an agreement
in principal” which does not create a binding contract to license at a FRAND rate, but only to
negotiate.122
The subsequent Innovatio case in the Northern District of Illinois also resulted in a FRAND rate
dramatically below what the SEP owner had originally offered.123 The original demand from
Innovatio was 6% of the value of “Wi-Fi’s contribution” to the final product, which was
calculated to be as high as $40 per chip. The court found the correct RAND rate to be 9.56 cents
per chip. In this case the judicial determination of FRAND was 0.2% of the $40 license rate
initially demanded for a bar code scanner.
In each of these cases, the court discusses patent hold-up and the fact that the FRAND
commitment is designed to prevent patent hold-up. In each of these cases, the court also
embraces the idea that the appropriate compensation for the technology does not include the
value of standardization itself.
Importantly, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit articulated these same themes in
December 2014 in the Ericsson v. D-Link case.124 In this case, the jury awarded damages to
Ericsson of $10 million, based on 15 cents per infringing device. The CAFC vacated that
damages award, finding that the jury had not been given sufficient instructions concerning the
meaning of FRAND. In particular, the trial judge should have instructed the jury concerning
which Georgia Pacific factors were relevant and the nature of Ericsson’s FRAND commitment.
The CAFC stated:
“Because SEP holders should only be compensated for the added benefit of their
inventions, the jury must be told to differentiate the added benefit from any value the
innovation gains because it has become standard essential. … [The jury] must be told to
consider the difference between the added value of the technological invention and the
added value of that invention’s standardization.”125
Interestingly, in January 2015 Ericsson filed suit against Apple at the International Trade
Commission (ITC) and in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Ericsson
claims that Apple is violating 41 patents that apply to both the iPhone and iPad, including SEPS
related to 2G and LTE.126 Apple’s response to the Ericsson suit asserts that Ericsson’s FRAND
demand is for 1.5% of the end price of the device, and that Ericsson believes it is “entitled to an
approximate 25 percent share of a total LTE ‘royalty stack.’”127 Ericsson has stated in other
venues that FRAND royalties should be driven by market forces and reflect the value of the
standardized technology.128 These points were explicitly rejected by the CAFC in Ericsson v. D122

Link. 129 Only time will tell whether the recent rulings regarding FRAND rates at the District
Court level and by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will deter SEP owners from
beginning their negotiations by making royalty demand that are more than two orders of
magnitude larger than what are later determined to be FRAND royalty rates.
Our conclusion regarding the determination of FRAND royalty rates is very encouraging, at least
in the United States. Important steps forward were taken over the last few years, both at the
District Court level and by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, to clarify how FRAND
rates will be determined in judicial proceedings.

G. Summary
However, our overall conclusions regarding SEPs are more mixed. We are concerned that
progress toward eliminating patent hold-up by SEP owners has stalled out, especially as regards
reform of the IPR rules at SSOs other than the IEEE. If so, that would be an unfortunate and
costly development. For example, the “Internet of Things” is a new and growing area where
royalty stacking and patent hold-up appear to be very real dangers. Devices of all sorts, from
thermostats to railroad cars to refrigerators, are being given mobile connectivity using standards
developed by SSOs. The price of those chips, and whether they cost $5 or $0.50 or $0.005, will
determine the nature of new applications and the rate of adoption.
Failure to prevent patent hold-up relating to tomorrow’s information technology and
communications standards is likely to cause significant social welfare loss in the years ahead. If
new and more effective private solutions relating to standard setting do not emerge to promote
innovation and protect consumers, antitrust enforcement is one of the only remaining remedies
that seems feasible.

5. Conclusions
Over the past five years, the rewards provided to patent owners in the United States have
become more closely matched with the value of the technology they contribute. When rewards
and contributions are aligned, economic efficiency is promoted because investments into
developing new technologies are commensurate with benefits. These changes have come from
legislation, the federal courts, and policy statements and enforcement actions by regulators of
various types. However, at this juncture, we see a substantial gap persisting between the ability
of some patent owners to monetize their patents and the contributions provided by the
technology underlying those patents. With the ‘internet of things’ poised to create economic
growth, this is a problem worthy of further research and policy attention.

129

“When dealing with SEPs, there are two special apportionment issues that arise. First, the patented feature must
be apportioned from all of the unpatented features reflected in the standard. Second, the patentee’s royalty must
be premised on the value of the patented feature, not any value added by the standard’s adoption of the patented
technology. These steps are necessary to ensure that the royalty award is based on the incremental value that the
patented invention adds to the product, not any value added by the standardization of that technology.” Ericsson
v. D-Link at 1232.
