    "abstract": "\n\nAcademic and practitioner research yields a proliferation of methods using size and value/growth attributes or factors to evaluate portfolio performance.  We assess the relative merits of several of the most widely-used procedures, including variants of matched-characteristic benchmark portfolios and time-series return regressions, by applying them to a sample of active money managers and passive indexes.  Estimated abnormal returns display large variation across approaches.  The benchmarks most widely used in academic research --- attribute-matched portfolios from independent sorts, the conventional three-factor time series model, and cross-sectional regressions of returns on stock characteristics --- have poor ability to track returns. Simple alterations are provided that improve the performance of the methods.\n\n",
