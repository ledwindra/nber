Capital Accumulation, Private Property and Rising Inequality in China, 1978-2015

ABSTRACT
This paper combines national accounts, survey, wealth and fiscal data (including recently
released tax data on high-income taxpayers) in order to provide consistent series on the
accumulation and distribution of income and wealth in China over the 1978-2015 period. We find
that the aggregate national wealth-income ratio has increased from 350% in 1978 to 700% in
2015. This can be accounted for by a combination of high saving and investment rates and a
gradual rise in relative asset prices, reflecting changes in the legal system of property. The share
of public property in national wealth has declined from about 70% in 1978 to 30% in 2015, which
is still a lot higher than in rich countries (close to 0% or negative). Next, we provide sharp
upward revision of official inequality estimates. The top 10% income share rose from 27% to
41% of national income between 1978 and 2015, while the bottom 50% share dropped from 27%
to 15%. China’s inequality levels used to be close to Nordic countries and are now approaching
U.S. levels.

Section 1. Introduction

Between 1978 and 2015, China has moved from a poor, underdeveloped country to
the world’s leading emerging economy. Despite the decline in its share of world
population, China’s share of world GDP increased from less than 3% in 1978 to 20%
in 2015 (Figure 1). According to official statistics, real per adult national income was
multiplied by more than 8. While average adult national income (expressed in 2015
euros) was about €120 per month in 1978, it exceeded €1,000 per month in 2015
(Figure 2).1

Unfortunately, relatively little is known about how the distribution of income and
wealth within China has changed over this critical period. That is, we do not have
consistent estimates of the extent to which the different income and wealth groups
have benefited (or not) from the enormous Chinese macroeconomic growth. The
household surveys that are used to study distributional issues in China suffer from
massive under-reporting, particularly at the top of the distribution, and are typically
not consistent with the data sources that are used to measure macro growth (namely,
national accounts). This is an issue of tremendous importance not only for China and
its future development path, but also for the rest of the world and the social
sustainability of globalization.

In this paper, we combine and confront several data sources—national accounts,
surveys, wealth rankings, and tax data, including recently released income tax data
covering high earners—to provide consistent series on the accumulation and
1

Annual per adult national income rose from less than 6,500 yuans in 1978 to over 57,800 yuans in
2015, i.e., from about 1,400 euros in 1978 to about 12,500 euros in 2015 (these amounts are
expressed in 2015 yuans and euros using the latest purchasing power parity estimates).

distribution of income and wealth in China over the 1978-2015 period. We make two
main contributions.

First, we combine official and non-official sources (including independent estimates of
China’s balance sheets) to provide the first systematic estimates of the level and
structure of China’s national wealth since the beginning of the market reform process.
We find that the national wealth-income ratio has increased from 350% in 1978 to
700% in 2015. This increase can be explained by a combination of high saving rates
and a gradual rise in relative asset prices, partly reflecting changes in the legal
system of property. The share of public property in national wealth has declined from
about 70% in 1978 to about 30% in 2015. More than 95% of the housing stock is now
owned by private households, as compared to about 50% in 1978. Chinese
corporations, however, are still predominantly publicly owned: close to 60% of
Chinese equities belong to the government (with a small but significant rebound since
2009), 30% to private Chinese owners, and 10% to foreigners—less than in the
United States, and much less than in Europe.

In brief: China has moved a long way toward private property between 1978 and
2015, but its property regime is still markedly different than in other parts of the world.
China has ceased to be communist, but is not entirely capitalist; it should rather be
viewed as a mixed economy with strong public ownership. The share of public
property in China today (30%) is higher than in the West during the mixed economy
regime of the post-World War 2 decades (around 15%-25%), %), although not hugely
so. And while the share of public property in national wealth has declined to 0% or
even less than 0% in Western countries (with public debt exceeding public assets in

5

the United States, Britain, Japan, and Italy today), the public share in China seems to
have strengthened since the 2008 financial crisis. These findings are not completely
unexpected, but we feel that it is important to be able to put numbers on these
evolutions. By constructing comparable series on the structure of national wealth, we
can better monitor and analyze the diversity of property structures over time and
across countries.

Our second contribution is to combine recently released tax data on high-income
individuals with household surveys and national accounts to provide new estimates of
income inequality. To our knowledge, it is the first time that tax data on high earners
are used to estimate income inequality in China.2 An income tax has been in place
since 1980, but until recently no detailed tax statistics were available, so that scholars
had to rely on household surveys based upon self-reported information. In 2006, the
Chinese tax administration started to release data on the numbers of high-income
individuals (i.e., with individual annual taxable income above 120,000 yuans) and
their incomes. We should make clear that this data is imperfect; our revised
estimates might well under-estimate inequality and our top income shares should be
viewed as lower bounds. What is interesting, however, is that even these lower
bounds are already a lot larger than official survey-based estimates. For recent
years, we find top 10% income shares around 41% of total income (as opposed to
31% in surveys), and top 1% income shares around 14% of total income (as opposed
to 6.5% in surveys). According to our series, the top 10% income share rose from
27% to 41% of national income between 1978 and 2015, while the bottom 50% share

Previous work on income inequality in China was almost entirely based upon household surveys.
See, e.g., Piketty and Qian (2009), Benjamin et al. (2005, 2008), Chi et al. (2011), Chi (2012),
Gustafsson et al. (2008a, 2008b), Khan and Riskin (2008, 2005), Knight et al. (2016), Knight (2014),
Li, Sato and Sicular (2013), and Xie et al. (2015, 2013).

fell from 27% to 15%. The urban-rural gap increased, but income concentration rose
a lot within both urban and rural China.

In effect, China’s inequality levels used to be less than European average levels in
the late 1970s—close to those observed in the most egalitarian Nordic countries—
while they are now approaching U.S. levels. Despite this rise, inequality in China
remains significantly lower than in the United States today. The bottom 50% earns
about 15% of total income in China versus 12% in the U.S. and 22% in France. For
the time being, China’s development model appears to be more egalitarian than that
of the United States, and less than Europe’s. Chinese inequality seems to have
stabilized in recent years, as the biggest increase took place between the mid-1980s
and the mid-2000s.

We also provide estimates of wealth inequality for the 1995-2016 period by
combining wealth surveys with data from the annual Hurun wealth rankings that
cover the wealthiest Chinese households. Consistent with the trend for income
inequality, wealth concentration has sharply increased too. The Chinese top 10%
wealth share (67% in 2015) is getting close to that of the United States (72%) and is
much higher than in a country like France (50%).

Although our new series on income and wealth in China are more homogenous and
comparable than previous attempts, we stress that they still have the potential to be
further improved as new data sources become available and better methods are
designed. All the series presented in this paper are available online on the World
Wealth and Income Database (http://WID.world); updated series will be posted there.

7

Our paper is part of a broader international project aimed at producing distributional
national accounts. The objective is to combine national accounts, surveys, and tax
data in a systematic manner to produce inequality series that are homogenous and
can be used to compare inequality across countries in a consistent way—in the same
manner as GDP can be used to compare the macroeconomic performances of
countries.3

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we describe our main data
sources, concepts, and methodology. Section 3 presents our results on the evolution
of aggregate wealth-income ratios and compare the findings to other countries. In
section 4 we present our results on the evolution of income and wealth inequality,
which we also compare to other countries. Section 5 provides concluding comments.
This paper is supplemented by an extensive online Appendix that includes all our raw
data sources and computer codes and presents additional robustness checks.4

Section 2. Data Sources, Concepts and Methodology

This paper relies on five types of data sources: national income and wealth macro
accounts, household income surveys, income tax data, household wealth surveys,
and wealth rankings. We start by describing the macro data sources, and then
proceed with distributional data. Our concepts and methods generally follow those
described in the Distributional National Accounts guidelines used for the World

3

Piketty, Saez and Zucman (2016) construct distributional national accounts for the United States,
and Garbinti, Goupille and Piketty (2017) for France. These and the present Chinese series all follow
the same guidelines (see Alvaredo et al., 2016). New and updated series will be regularly made
available on-line on the World Wealth and Income Database (WID.world).

Wealth and Income Database (Alvaredo et al., 2016). In this section, we focus on the
main conceptual and empirical issues; complete methodological details are provided
in the online Appendix.

Section 2.1. National income and wealth series

We first provide consistent macro series for national income, national wealth, and
their components from 1978 to 2015. To establish these series, we follow the U.N.
System of National Accounts (SNA, 2008) conceptual framework and the definitions
used by Piketty and Zucman (2014), Piketty (2014), and Alvaredo et al. (2016).

Section 2.1.1. Basic conceptual framework

National income Yt is defined in the standard manner as GDP minus capital
depreciation plus net foreign income. Private wealth Wt is defined as the total value
of assets owned by households and non-profit institutions, net of debts.5

Following the SNA, assets include all the non-financial (i.e., real) assets—housing,
land, buildings, machines, intellectual property etc.—and financial assets—including
life insurance and pensions funds—over which ownership rights can be enforced and
that provide economic benefits to their owners. Pay-as-you-go Social Security
pension wealth is excluded, just like all other claims on future government
expenditures and transfers. Durable goods owned by households, such as cars and
furniture, are excluded from wealth as well. Non-financial assets are the only “real”
5

At this stage, Chinese data sources do not allow do decompose private wealth into personal wealth
(households) and non-profit wealth (non-profit institutions, usually a relatively small part of private
wealth), so we only provide series for aggregate private wealth (personal plus non-profit).

9

assets, in the sense that financial assets and liabilities balance each other at the
world level and do not contribute to global net wealth. As a rule, all assets and
liabilities are valued at their prevailing market prices. Corporations are included in
private wealth through the market value of equities owned by households. Unquoted
shares are typically valued based on observed market prices for comparable, publicly
traded companies.

We similarly define public (or government) wealth Wgt as the net wealth of public
administrations and government agencies. In available balance sheets, public nonfinancial assets like administrative buildings, schools and hospitals are valued by
cumulating past investment flows and upgrading them using observed real estate
prices. We define market-value national wealth Wnt as the sum of private and public
wealth: Wnt = Wt + Wgt. National wealth can also be decomposed into domestic capital
and net foreign assets: Wnt = Kt + NFAt. Domestic capital Kt can in turn be
decomposed as the sum of agricultural land, housing, and other domestic capital
(including the market value of corporations, and the value of other non-financial
assets held by the private and public sectors, net of their liabilities).

While these definitions are standard, two remarks are in order when applying them to
China. First, the notions of private and public property do not exactly have the same
meaning in China as in developed capitalist countries. The private property of
agricultural land (and other agricultural equipment and assets) is relatively unsecure
in China. Individual owners have land use rights that can be transmitted to their
children as long as they stay in the countryside (more precisely, as long they keep
their rural Hukou), but lose all rights to the land in case they move permanently to the

10

cities (their land is then returned to the local government and allocated to other
individuals).6 In order to reflect this semi-private, semi-public form of ownership, and
the fact that the rights of private owners have gradually increased over time (both
land use and transmission rights were gradually extended in the 1980s and 1990s),
we assume that the public property share in agricultural gradually declined from 70%
in 1978 to 40% in 2015. We also show how our results would be affected if we were
to use other private-public splitting rules (see section 3 below). As we shall see, this
has a relatively limited impact on our main findings.

Second, corporations cannot be valued at their prevailing market price when no stock
market exists, which was the case between 1949 and 1990. An alternative measure
of the wealth of corporations is the value of corporate assets (net of non-equity
liabilities), what we call the corporations’ book value. By definition, corporations’ book
and market values are the same when Tobin's Q—the ratio between market and
book values—is equal to one. Chinese Tobin’s Q ratios display significant time
variation after 1993; they fall, for instance, after the 2008 crisis. But overall, they
appear to be close to 1. In effect, they seem to be closer to U.S. and U.K. levels,
where Q ratios are close to 1 and sometime higher to 1, than to Japanese, German
or French levels, where Q ratios are typically in the 0.5–0.8 range (Piketty and
Zucman, 2014).
6

There are two type of Hukou (residence registrations): agriculture Hukou (in rural China) and nonagriculture Hukou (in urban China). People with agriculture Hukou from rural China can keep their
agriculture Hukou even when they are working in the cities, and in this way they are still entitled to
their lands. They can also choose to change their Hukou to a non-agriculture Hukou (city Hukou),
provided they are working in the city and satisfy the requirements of the Hukou change process (for
example, having worked more than a certain number of years in the city), which give them access to
various other rights (access to certain schools and public services for their family, etc.). After they
change their Hukou, they lose their lands in their village. Because the price of land has increased
quickly in the last 20 years, agriculture Hukou has become more valuable, and some migrant city
workers prefer to keep their agriculture Hukou, even if it restricts their access to other rights. It is
almost impossible to change Hukou from non-agriculture to agriculture.

11

Before 1993, when no estimates of the market value of Chinese corporate equities
exist, we compute the value of Chinese corporations by assuming that Tobin’s Q is
equal to 1. In the online Appendix, we also report comprehensive series of national
wealth where corporations are valued at their book value instead of market prices
throughout the 1978–2016 period—what we call book-value national wealth. 7
Because Tobin’s Q is usually close to 1 after 1993, book- and market-value national
wealth are usually similar. In the rest of the paper we focus on market-value series.

Section 2.1.2. Data sources for China’s national income and wealth

There exists a relatively long tradition of national accounts in China. 8 For the recent
period, we use official national accounts (described below) that comply with the latest
international guidelines (SNA, 1993, 2008). Before 1992, Chinese national accounts
were based on the Material Planning System. We have homogenized these data by
using the same concepts and definitions as in the most recent official accounts. 9 The
basic sources for income and output are China’s Statistical Yearbook and
Compendium of Statistics, available since 1949. These sources allow us to provide
annual series of national income and its components over the 1978-2015 period.

There is considerable debate about whether and by how much official Chinese
statistics overstate income growth. Young (2003) provides a careful treatment of this

7

That is, we define book-value national wealth Wbt as the sum of market-value national wealth and
residual corporate wealth: Wbt = Wnt + Wct = Wt + W gt + Wct. Residual corporate wealth Wct is the
difference between the book-value of corporations and their market value (the value of their equities).
By definition, Wct is equal to zero when Tobin’s Q is equal to 1.
8
The first estimation of China’s national income was made by Wu Baosan (1947), who provides
estimates of national income for the 1930s with detailed sectoral breakdown. Liu-Yeh (1965) estimates
national income for the 1933-1959 period and Rawski (1989) for the 1913-1945 period. Since we
begin our series in 1978 we do not use this work.

issue, making systematic downward corrections to Chinese growth by re-estimating
the GDP deflator using official statistics. We follow his methodology and replicate his
corrections. In addition, we slightly increase the level of GDP by imputing positive
housing rental income in GDP, which is not currently done in the official Chinese
national accounts. After these corrections, our real GDP growth rate lies in between
the official GDP growth rate and the conservative estimate of Maddison and Wu
(2008); it is closer to Maddison and Wu’s.10

As for national wealth, there exists an early attempt by Chow (1993) to document
capital formation in China. Chow, however, does not a provide a complete balance
sheet; it is impossible to fully study the division between public and private property,
the role of asset prices, and the importance of land using his series. We rely instead
on official and non-official independent estimates of China’s balance sheets. The
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has compiled national balance sheets since 1997,
but the data have not been published so far. Official series on the stock of fixed
assets, however, are available. In addition to these official series, several recent
academic studies attempt to construct the national balance sheet of China. The most
detailed attempts are those of Ma et al. (2012), Cao et al. (2012), and Li et al. (2013,
2015).

We start with Ma et al. (2012), Yang et al. (2013, 2015), and the official fixed asset
estimates, and apply adjustments to ensure homogeneity and comparability with
developed countries’ balance sheets. Available data sources before 1993 are
relatively limited, so we choose to begin our annual series in 1993, and we provide
10

See Appendix Section A.21 for a thorough discussion of this issue.

13

two separate estimates for 1978 and 1985. We include new estimates for the value of
agricultural land and housing for 1978, 1985, and 1993-2015, and we adjust the
value of agricultural land to take into account the semi-private nature of rural assets
(see section 2.1.1. above). All computations and adjustments made to the raw
national balance sheet data are discussed in detail in the Appendix Section A.1.

Section 2.2. Series on income and wealth distribution in China

Section 2.2.1. Income distribution series

We construct our income distribution series by combining national accounts, income
surveys, wealth data (surveys and wealth rankings), and tax data. We proceed in
three steps: we start from household income surveys, which we correct using income
tax data on high-income individuals. We then use national accounts and wealth data
ta impute tax-exempt capital income. All corresponding computer code is provided
online, and complete methodological details and extensive robustness checks are
discussed in the online Appendix Section B.

Step 1. We start from the large, nationally representative household surveys
conducted each year in rural and urban areas by China’s Statistical Bureau (CSB).11
The micro-files from these surveys are not accessible, but CSB publishes tabulations
using many income brackets and detailed information about income categories
(wages, pension and other replacement income, business, and capital income) and

11

The sample size has varied between 10 000 households (for older surveys) and 50 000 households
(in recent surveys) per year in both the rural and the urban survey.

14

household size. We use all the annual tabulations from 1978 to 2015 for both the
rural and the urban surveys.12

Using the generalized Pareto interpolation techniques developed by Blanchet,
Fournier and Piketty (2017), we estimate the full distribution of income separately for
rural China, urban China, and China as a whole. We express the distributions in
terms of generalized percentiles (or g-percentiles). There are 127 g-percentiles: 99
for the bottom 99 percentiles, 9 for the bottom 9 tenth-of-percentiles of the top
percentile, 9 for the bottom 9 one-hundredth-of-percentiles of the top tenth-ofpercentile, and 10 for the 10 one-thousandth-of-percentile of the top one-hundredthof-percentile.

The survey income concept that we use is pre-tax, post-replacement income. That is,
pension income (and other replacement income such as unemployment insurance) is
included in income, while pension contributions (and other social contributions
financing replacement income flows) are deducted.13 The unit of observation is the
adult individual, with income equally split between household members. That is, we
are interested in the distribution of per-adult income and divide household income by
the number of adults in each household.14
12

Note that these surveys have been conducted by CSB since the early 1950s, and that the 19501978 tabulations could also be used using the same methods. The data suggests that income
inequality during the 1950s-1970s (as measured by these surveys) was relatively stable at very low
levels (close to the levels that we observe in 1978, which are indeed extremely low by historical and
international standards).
13
This is similar to the pre-tax national concept defined in Alvaredo et al. (2016) (and stands in
contrast to pre-tax factor income, which treats pension and other replacement income on a
contribution basis rather than a distribution basis), except of course that survey data miss important
components of national income, especially among top income earners, hence the corrections
described below.
14
This is the same equal-split adult concept as that used in distributional national accounts series
recently constructed for the United States (Piketty, Saez and Zucman, 2016) and France (Garbinti,
Goupille and Piketty, 2017), except that the equal-split operation is done at the household level in
China rather than at the tax-unit level (married couples) in the United States and France. This implies

15

Step 2. We then correct the top of the distribution of survey income by using income
tax data. A progressive income tax has been in place since 1980. Until recently,
however, the Chinese tax administration did not release detailed income tax
statistics: the only information available was the aggregate income tax revenue,
sometime with a breakdown by income sources, but not by income bracket. In the
absence of better data, Piketty and Qian (2009) used household surveys and the
income tax law to simulate theoretical income tax revenues, and found that simulated
revenues were smaller than observed revenues—suggesting that top incomes are
under-reported in surveys, in line with what is usually found in other countries.15

In 2006, the Chinese tax administration issued a circular requiring all taxpayers with
individual taxable income above 120,000 yuans to file a special declaration, and it
started to release the number of such taxpayers and their taxable incomes.16 These
new fiscal statistics on high earners were released annually at the national level from
2006 to 2010, but the publication was interrupted in 2011. The circular, however, still
applies today, and for income years 2011 to 2015 publication of the data continued at
that we probably somewhat underestimate inequality in China as compared to the United States and
France (i.e., we impose more intra-household redistribution than for the United States and France).
Note also that the raw household survey tabulations that we use are based on per-capita household
income (total income divided by the number of adults and children), which we correct by assuming the
same adults/children ratio for all brackets. If high earners have fewer children than average, we slightly
under-estimate inequality. Finally, note also that the top decile household income shares reported by
Piketty and Qian (2009) for China over the 1986-2003 period do not control at all for household size,
which explains why they are significantly higher (2-3 points) than the (uncorrected) top decile
household income shares reported here (which are based upon per adult income).
15
See also Xu and Yue (2013), who combine urban household surveys, tax legislation and aggregate
tax revenues to simulate the redistributive impact of China’s income tax.
16
Per the circular, taxable income is defined the sum of wage income, business income, and taxable
capital income, minus deductions (which can be estimated to represent on average about 20% of prededuction fiscal income, so that the taxable income threshold of 120,000 yuans corresponds to a fiscal
income threshold of about 150,000 yuans). China’s income tax is a three-part system, in the sense
that wage income, business income and capital income are taxed separately (wage income is taxed at
progressive rates going from 0% to 45%; business income at progressive rates from 0% to 35%;
capital income at a flat rate of usually 20%), so that total taxable income does not usually need to
declared, except in the context of the 2006 circular. The objective of the circular was to improve tax
collection and to fight corruption.

16

the provincial level (sometime with additional information on taxpayers with incomes
above 500,000 yuans and 1 million yuans). We collected these provincial tabulations,
which together provide useful information about top incomes, even though not all
provinces have been covered since 2011. Taxpayers reporting over 120,000 yuans in
taxable income represent roughly the top 0.5% of the urban adult population at the
national level between 2006 and 2010 (less than 0.4% in 2006, over 0.6% in 2010).17

Although the fiscal data is imperfect (and should probably be seen as providing a
lower bound for actual inequality), the interesting point is that the fiscal incomes
reported by this top 0.5% group are already substantially larger than the levels
observed for the top 0.5% in the urban household survey. During the 2006–2010
period, the ratios between fiscal and survey incomes fall in the 1.3–1.6 range if we
look at the quantile function q(p) (i.e., the income threshold q(p) corresponding to
percentile p = 0.995) and in the 2.5–3 range when we look at the upper incomes y(p)
(i.e., the average income y(p) above percentile p = 0.995). In other words, top
incomes are massively underestimated in surveys.18

Our benchmark correction is based upon the following assumption: the survey data is
reliable below percentile p1 = 0.8, the fiscal data is reliable above p2 = 0.995, and we
assume that the quantile ratio upgrade factor f(p) rises piecewise-linearly from
f(p1) = 1 to the observed fiscal/survey ratio f(p2) between p1 and p2, so as to generate
a smooth and convex Pareto curve (see Blanchet, Fournier and Piketty 2017). We
17

The absolute number of high-income taxpayers rises from about 1.6 million in 2006 to 3.1 million in
2010. We compare this number to the total urban population (rather than the total Chinese population)
because rural incomes are much lower than urban incomes (hence much less likely to meet the
120,000 yuans threshold), and because agricultural income is entirely exempt from the income tax,
which in effect should be viewed as an urban income tax.
18
In particular, the inverted Pareto coefficient b(p) = y(p) / q(p) is as low as 1.5 or less in the survey,
as opposed to 2.5–3 or more in the tax data.

17

then apply generalized Pareto interpolation techniques to the corrected tabulations to
obtain the full distribution of fiscal income among equal-split adults in urban and rural
China, by generalized percentiles, each year from 1978 to 2015.19 We also provide
several variants based upon different piecewise-linear profiles for the upgrade factor
between f(p1) and f(p2). As shown in Appendix Section B.1, this has a relatively
limited impact on the results.20

Step 3. Finally, we correct our fiscal income series to take into account tax-exempt
capital income and estimate the distribution of total pre-tax national income.
Important components of capital income are missing from fiscal income data, even in
the absence of any tax evasion. First and most importantly, the undistributed profits
of privately-owned corporations are not included in fiscal income subject to the
income tax in China (nor in most other countries). It is important to correct for this,
because the extent to which private shareholders choose to accumulate wealth in the
form of undistributed profits (as opposed to dividends and other forms of capital
payments such as shares buybacks) may well vary over time and across countries
(e.g., due to changing tax incentives), which might introduce biases in inequality

19

In the absence of any other information, we choose to apply the average profile of upgrade factors
f(p) between p1 = 0.9 and p2 = 0.995 estimated for the 2006-2010 period to all years of the period
1978-2005. This assumption is further justified by the absence of any clear trend in the
observed/simulated income tax revenue ratios computed by Piketty and Qian (2009) over the 19862003 period. We also choose to apply this same average profile of upgrade factors for all years of the
period 2011-2015, as available provincial data on high-income taxpayers suggest that there is no clear
trend in the magnitude of the downward bias in the survey. The online appendix section B.1 presents
and discusses several robustness checks and alternative assumptions and specifications.
20
One should note that the Chinese high-income tax data is entirely based upon individual incomes.
This corresponds to equal-split income (in the sense of U.S. or French tax data) only if we assume that
all high-income taxpayers are either single or married to other high-income taxpayers, which strictly
speaking cannot be true. This implies that our estimates tend to over-estimate inequality as compared
to the equal-split benchmark, and to under-estimate inequality as compare to the individualistic
benchmark (where each spouse is assigned his or her own income). If we obtain access to micro-level
Chinese tax data, we will be able to refine this analysis and compute separate equal-split and
individualistic series.

18

statistics, particularly at the top of the distribution. The other main form of tax-exempt
capital income is owner-occupied housing rents. We proceed as follows.

First, using the national accounts we estimate the evolution of total non-fiscal capital
income ynf, which we define as the private share of undistributed profits and other
tax-exempt capital income (including imputed housing rents) accruing to Chinese
households. We find that ynf gradually rises from less than 5% of per adult national
income to as much as 15% over the 1978-2015 period (with a peak in 2007, and a
decline to about 11-12% in recent years), largely due to the rise of private corporate
ownership and private housing. In contrast, total fiscal income yf (i.e., total income
subject to the income tax, before any deduction) represents approximately 70% of
national income throughout the 1978–2015 period.21 To estimate the distribution of
personal income yp = yf + ynf, we need to make an assumption about the distribution
of ynf and the correlation between yf and ynf. We assume that ynf follows the same
distribution as wealth, which we estimate by applying generalized Pareto interpolation
techniques to household wealth surveys and wealth rankings (see section 2.2.2
below).22 As for the correlation structure between yf and ynf, on the basis of estimates
obtained in countries with adequate micro-files (namely, the United States and
France, see Blanchet, Fournier and Piketty, 2017), we use the family of Gumbel
copulas, with Gumbel parameter θ = 3.23

21

See the online Appendix Section B. In effect, we break down national income y as y = yf + ynf + yg,
with yg = government net capital income (including the government’s share of undistributed profits) +
indirect taxes (net production taxes) received by the government.
22
The distribution of corporate equity is more concentrated than the distribution of wealth in general,
so this assumption may lead us to under-estimate the concentration of non-fiscal income ynf. Note also
that we do not have complete annual estimates for the distribution of wealth (see below), so for
missing years we use linear interpolations. Given that the aggregate value of ynf is small as compared
to yf, the total impact of these simplifying assumptions on the distribution of yp = yf + ynf is relatively
small, as we show in robustness checks and alternative series presented in Appendix Section B.1.
23
A Gumbel parameter θ = 1 corresponds to perfect independence, and θ = +∞ to perfect correlation.
In the online Appendix Section B.1, we show that assuming Gumbel parameters in the 2–4 range

19

Finally, we apply a proportional upgrade factor to transform the distribution of
personal income yp = yf + ynf into the distribution of national income y. By construction
this has no impact on income shares. The goal of this normalization is to ensure that
total individual incomes add up to national income, so as to make the levels of
income comparable across countries.24

Section 2.2.2. Wealth distribution series

The raw data sources at our disposal to measure the evolution of wealth are more
limited than for income. We use the CHIP household wealth surveys conducted in
1995 and 2002, and the CFPS household wealth surveys conducted in 2010 and
2012.25 We have access to the micro-files of these surveys. They show a substantial
rise in wealth concentration over time.26 Since it is always a challenge to reach out to
very wealthy individuals in surveys, it is likely that they under-estimate top wealth
levels. We therefore combine the wealth surveys with the data from the annual Hurun
rankings of China’s wealthiest households covering the 2001-2016 period. We apply

instead of 3 has only a small impact on our final series (see in particular Appendix Figures B.11 and
B.12).
24
Note that yg (= y – yp) equals government net capital income (including the government share of
undistributed profits) plus indirect taxes (net production taxes) received by the government. We have
no reason to allocate yg in a non-proportional manner, so we adopt this distribution-neutral strategy.
25
CHIP surveys were also conducted in 2008 and 2013, but these two survey years raise difficulties,
so we do not use them (the 2008 survey had problems with the sampling process and is considered
not to be nationally representative, and the 2013 survey has no information on housing values).
26
Previous work on Chinese wealth inequality includes Gan et al. (2015), Li and Wan (2015), Xie and
Jin (2015), Knight and Li (2016), Tan, Zeng, and Zhu (2017). By comparing the CHIP 2002 survey and
the CFPS 2010 survey, Li and Wan (2015) find that the top 10% wealth share rose from 38.7% to
64.2%. Knight and Li (2016), using the CHIP 2002 and 2013 surveys, find that the top 10% wealth
share rose from 37.1% to 48.4% from 2002 to 2013. Using the CFPS 2012 survey and the Hurun
Richlist 2012, Xie and Jin (2015) find that the top 10% wealth share is 62.1% in 2012 and the top 1%
wealth share is 35.3%. Similarly, Tan, Zeng, and Zhu (2017) use the 2011 CHFS and find a top 10%
wealth share of 64.4%.

Section 3. The Rise of Wealth-Income Ratios and Private Property in China

In this Section, we present our main results on the evolution of aggregate wealth from
1978 to 2015.

Section 3.1. The evolution of wealth-income ratios and public property

We start with the general evolution of the level and structure of national wealth. The
Chinese national wealth-national income ratio has increased substantially in recent
decades, from about 350% in 1978 to 500% in 1993 and over 700% in 2015, with
important changes in the composition of wealth (Figure 3). Agricultural land used to
account for almost half of total wealth in 1978, and now accounts for less than a
tenth. In contrast, housing and other domestic capital (buildings, equipment,
machinery, patents, etc., used by corporations, public administrations, and
households) increased enormously, both in shares and in levels. Net foreign assets
have become a significant addition to China’s national wealth since the mid-2000s.

The most spectacular evolution involves the division of national wealth into private
and public wealth (Figure 4). Private wealth was relatively small in 1978 (about 100%
of national income), and now represents over 450% of national income. Public
wealth, by contrast, has remained roughly stable around 250% of national income. As

27

See Appendix Sections B.1. and B.3. These wealth distribution series should be viewed as
provisional and subject to revision.

21

a result, while in 1978 about 70% of national wealth was public and 30% private, in
2015 the proportion are reversed: 30% of national wealth is public and 70% private.
China used to be a communist country and is now a mixed economy.

The privatization process was particularly extensive for housing: 95% of the housing
stock is now privately owned, against 50% in 1978 (Figure 5). The situation is
different for other domestic capital: the public share has declined, but it is still about
50%. If we look more specifically at the ownership of domestic equities (traded and
non-traded), we find that private ownership was negligible in 1978 (about 5%), and
reaches about 30% in 2015. This is obviously a large rise, but it means that the
government remains the owner of about 60% of Chinese domestic equities (while
foreigners own the remaining 10%). Interestingly, the fraction of Chinese equities that
is publicly owned dropped substantially until 2006, but seems to have stabilized—or
even increased somewhat—since 2007 (Figure 6).28

When comparing China to other countries, we find that the private wealth-national
income ratio in China is now close to Western levels: 450-500% in China in 2015, vs.
500% in the United States and 550-600% in Britain and France (Figure 7a). The
major difference is that public wealth has become very small—or even negative, with
public debt exceeding public assets—in Western countries, while it has remained
substantial in China (Figure 7b).

28

Our estimate of government wealth is close to the one obtained by Li (2013a, 2013b, 2015). Another
way to assess the role of the public sector is to study the government revenue flow, including the
income from property controlled by the government (distributed and undistributed profits and other
capital income flows). Naughton (2017) finds that public revenue increased from 16% of national
income in 1997 to 41% in 2015. Following Naughton (2017), in the Appendix we estimate public
revenue for the period from 1992 to 2015. We find the same rising trend of public revenue as
Naughton (2017), although we obtain slightly different levels due to different definitions of public
revenue. For a detailed comparison, see the online Appendix Section A.24.

22

Net public wealth used to be positive and substantial in all Western countries in 1978;
the government owned between 15% and 25% of national wealth in the United
States, Japan, France, Germany and Britain in the mid-1970s (Piketty and Zucman,
2014; Piketty, 2014). This mixed economy regime resulted from a combination of low
public debt (following post-World War 2 debt restructuring and inflation) and a large
public sector, including in some cases government ownership of large companies in
banking and manufacturing (such as in France until the mid-1980s). The share of
public property in China today is somewhat larger than—but by no means
incomparable to—what it was in the West from the 1950s to the 1980s.29

If anything, the public share in China’s mixed economy seems to have increased
since the 2008 financial crises, while it has dropped in rich countries—net public
wealth is now slightly negative in the United States, Japan and Great Britain, and
only slightly positive in Germany and France.

The structure of national property has large implications for economic development.
The size of public property affects the State’s ability to conduct industrial and regional
development policy (sometime in an efficient way, sometime less so). It also has
potentially large fiscal consequences: governments with negative net public wealth
typically must pay large interest payments before they can finance public spending
and welfare transfers, while those with large positive net public wealth can benefit
from substantial capital income and finance more spending than what they levy in

We present two alternative series on the public share in China’s national wealth, depending on what
fraction of agricultural land is assigned to the government and the private sector (see the discussion in
section 2.1 above). This makes a significant difference at the beginning of the period (given the
importance of agricultural land in 1978), but has relatively little effect in 2015 (see Figure 7d). In any
case, the general trend and orders of magnitudes are not affected.

taxes. To a large extent this is an under-studied subject, partly because of the lack of
adequate data collection on national balance sheets. Looking forward, it would be
valuable to collect more data to be able to compare the evolution of China’s property
structure not only with Western countries but also with other emerging economies.

It is interesting to compare the evolution of the public share in national wealth in
China and in an oil-rich country such as Norway with a large sovereign wealth fund.
Both countries have basically switched positions: the public share declined from 70%
to 30% in China between 1978 and 2015, while it rose from 30% to 60% in Norway
(Figure 7e). A key difference between public wealth in Norway and China is that most
of Norway’s public wealth is invested abroad. Norway’s large positive net public
wealth generates capital income that is mostly used to finance further foreign capital
accumulation, which in the long-run can be used to reduce the tax burden and to
finance more public spending. In that sense, it is a very different form of public
property than in China: in Norway public property has mostly a fiscal and financial
dimension, not so much an industrial or control dimension (although Norway’s
sovereign fund is sometime also used to promote certain policies, e.g., social or
environmental objectives).30

Section 3.2. Decomposing wealth accumulation

30

It is worth noting that China’s net foreign asset position, although it has increased substantially in
the past 15 years (about 25% of national income, vs. less than 2% of national income in 2000)
remains relatively modest, not only as compared to oil countries like Norway (over 250% of national
income in 2015), but most importantly as compared to Japan (78% in 2015) and Germany (35%). In
contrast the national wealth-national income ratio is now higher in China than in Japan and other
developed countries (see Figure 8). In other words, as compared to the other two major countries with
positive net foreign wealth (Japan and Germany), China’s wealth accumulation is primarily driven by
domestic capital accumulation.

24

How can we explain the sharp increase in China’s national wealth-national income
ratio over the last decades? The high Chinese saving rates are obviously an
important contributor, but they are not sufficient to account for the full increase. The
other part of the explanation is the rise of equity and housing prices, above and
beyond the rise in consumer prices. By our estimates, saving explains 50% to 60% of
the rise in the wealth-income ratio since 1978, while the increase in relative asset
prices accounts for the remaining 40% to 50%.31

Just like in rich countries, the rise in relative asset prices can itself be accounted for
by a series of factors. First is the high demand for housing assets by Chinese
households, itself maybe partly due to limited access to alternative saving and
investment vehicles and to insufficient visibility on the expansion of the public
pension system. Another important explanation involves changes in the legal system
that reinforced private property rights: lifting of rent control, changes in the relative
power of landlords and tenants, changes in the relative power of shareholder and
workers. It is striking that Tobin’s Q—the ratio between the market and the book
value of corporations—appears to be high in China (close to 100%, like in the United
States and in the United Kingdom, as opposed to 40%-60% in Germany or Japan).
Whether this reflects strong shareholders’ rights is, however, unclear at this stage:
the series at our disposal are imperfect, and some of the cross-country differences in
Tobin’s Q might reflect data limitations. More research is needed before we can
reach firm conclusions on the quantitative importance of changes in the legal system
in explaining the rise of Chinese wealth. Similarly, our series do not allow us to take a

See Appendix Tables A.40 to A.49, where we present detailed decompositions of wealth
accumulation into volume and price effects for the 1978–2015 period, following the methodology used
by Piketty and Zucman (2014) in rich countries.

25

stance on the (arguably even more complicated) issue of dynamic efficiency in
China.32

Table 1 decomposes 1996–2015 wealth accumulation by sectors (private and public)
and assets (financial and non-financial). Regarding private wealth, we find strong
positive capital gains for non-financial assets—mainly housing—and no gains for
financial wealth. Conversely, we find strong capital gains for public financial assets
and smaller gains for public non-financial wealth. The large capital gains on public
financial assets mostly come from government-owned equities, and can be linked to
the reform of SOEs since 2003 and the unprecedented wave of initial public offerings
of SOEs that started in 2006. China also made capital losses on its net foreign
assets, in part due to the appreciation of the yuan after 2004. This explains why
given despite its large current account surpluses, the net foreign asset position has
increased only moderately (from -9% of national income in 2000 to 15% in 2015). If
China had earned the same return on its foreign assets as on its liabilities, its net
foreign asset position would reach around 35% of national income today.

Last, we present series on domestic financial intermediation. The ratio between total
domestic financial liabilities (i.e., total debt and equity issued by households, the

32

Given China’s huge growth rates and very high wealth-income ratios, one might be tempted to
conclude that China falls in the paradigmatic situation of dynamic inefficiency and excessive capital
accumulation. Indeed, and although there is uncertainty about the exact level of the net-ofdepreciation capital share α, the average rate of return to capital r is clearly less than the growth rate g
(i.e., with a capital share α ≈ 35% and a national wealth-income ratio β ≈ 700% we have
r = α/β ≈ 5% < g ≈ 7-8%). In a standard one-good model of capital accumulation, r < g implies
excessive capital accumulation, so that in principle an extension of the pay-as-you-go pension system
(or higher public debt) could generate Pareto improvements. See, e.g., Song et al (2015) for a
discussion. However, the analysis is made more complicated by the fact that we are not in a simple
one-good model: relative land prices matter, and so does the relative bargaining power of owners vs.
non-owners, and more generally the legal system. Our data series do not allow us to put precise
numbers on all these parameters and are not sufficient to do a proper welfare analysis (which in any
case would require an explicitly distributional analysis).

26

government, and the corporate sector combined) and total domestic capital has risen
from 60% in 1978 to 140% in 2015. This is a substantial rise, starting from a situation
of limited financial development. Despite this rise, however, the level of financial
intermediation remains much lower in China than in Western countries, where the
financial intermediation ratio rose from 100-140% in 1978 to 200-300% in 2015
(Figure 9a). The fraction of domestic financial liabilities owned by the rest of the world
reaches about 5% in China in 2015, as compared to almost 10% in Japan, 15% in
the United States and 25-30% in Germany and France (Figure 9b). These differences
partly reflect size effects: European countries are smaller, and if we were to
consolidate ownership at the European level, the rest of the world would own only
about 15% of European wealth (like in the United States). But there seems to be
more than this: Asian countries—Japan and even more so China—seem to be less
open to foreign ownership than Europe and North America.

Section 4. The Rise of Income and Wealth Inequality in China

We now turn to our results on the evolution of income and wealth inequality.

Section 4.1. Income inequality

Section 4.1.1. The distribution of national income and its evolution

Table 2 reports statistics on the distribution of pre-tax national income in China in
2015, obtained by combining survey, fiscal, and national accounts data. The data
cover the entire distribution from the bottom 50% up to the top 0.001%. Average

27

income in the entire adult population is 57,800 yuans, but this average mask a great
deal of heterogeneity. The average income of the bottom 50% (a group that includes
530 million adults) is equal to 30% of the average income in China. Hence the bottom
50% earns 15% (30% times 50%) of total income. By contrast, the average income of
the top 10% (a group that includes 106 million adults) is more than 4 times the
average income in China. Hence the top 10% earns more than 40% (4 times 10%) of
total income. The middle 40% earns a bit more than 40% of all income, so that their
average income is slightly higher than the average per adult income.

Income inequality has increased markedly since the beginning for the market reform
process. By our estimates, the share of national income going to the top 10% of the
population has increased from 27% in 1978 to 41% in 2015, while the share going to
the bottom 50% has dropped from 27% to 15% (Figure 10). In other words, the
bottom 50% of the population used to have about the same income share as the top
10% (which also means that their average income was about 5 times lower), while
their income share is now about 2.7 times lower (which means that their average
income is now about 13.5 times lower). Over the same period, the share of income
going to the middle 40% has been roughly stable.

If we compare our inequality series to the official survey-based estimates, two
remarks are in order. First, survey data also show a strong rise in the top 10%
income share and a strong decline in the top 50% income share from 1978 to 2015.
Second, both the level and the rise of inequality are larger in our series. The top 10%
income share rises 15 points against 9 points in the survey-based statistics (Figure
11). The upward correction is particularly spectacular for the top 1%: by our

28

estimates the top 1% earns about 14% of total income in 2015, versus 6.5% only in
the raw surveys (Figure 12).

Most of the difference between our estimates and the raw surveys comes from the
high-income tax data. The undistributed-profits correction does rise at the end of the
period, particularly for very top incomes (reflecting the rise of private business
ownership), but it is always less important than the fiscal correction. In 2015, for
instance, the top 1% income share is 6.5% in the raw surveys, it reaches 11.5% after
factoring in the high-income taxpayers data, and 14% after factoring in undistributed
profits and other tax-exempt income (see Appendix Figures B.1 to B.4).

According to our series, most of the increase in top income shares took place
between 1980 and 2006. Income inequality appears to have stabilized since then.
The raw surveys show a small but regular decline in income inequality since 2006,
which in our series is offset by the rise of undistributed profits. Our results are
consistent with the findings of Kanbur, Wang, and Zhang (2017) who argue that a
turnaround indeed took place around 2006, due to a mixture of policy changes and
the slowdown of structural transformation. This result—stabilization of inequality
since 2006—should however be taken with caution, as it could partly reflect data
limitations.33

Section 4.1.2. Income inequality in urban vs. rural China

33

In particular, the lack of national data on high-income taxpayers since 2011 forces us to apply the
2006-2010 average correction factors to years 2011-2015 (in effect making it impossible to detect a
possible rebound of inequality since 2011). See section 2.2 above and the online Appendix Section B.

29

What role does the urban-rural gap play in the evolution of Chinese inequality? Adult
urban population rose from 100 million in 1978 to almost 600 million by 2015. In the
meantime, adult rural population remained roughly stable: it was 400 million in 1978,
rose to almost 600 million by the mid-1990s, and then declined to less than 500
million in 2015 (Figure 13). The income gap between urban and rural China has
always been large, and it has grown over time: urban households earned on average
twice as much income as rural households in 1978; they now earn 3.5 times as much
(Figure 14). As a result, while the urban share in adult population has grown from
20% in 1978 to 55% in 2015, the urban share in income has increased from 30% to
80% (Figure 15).

Despite the increase of the urban-rural gap, the rise of inequality in China is primarily
due to rising income dispersion within both urban and rural China. The top 10% and
top 1% income shares have increased almost as much within urban and rural China
as nationally (Figures 16 and 17). It is also interesting to note that there has always
been more inequality within rural areas than within urban China. Last, one can see
the strong effect of the urban-rural gap when we look at the bottom 50%. The income
share of the bottom 50% has sharply declined between 1978 and 2015, both within
rural and urban China and nationally (Figure 18). The bottom 50% income share,
however, is markedly lower at the national level (15%) than within rural China (20%)
or urban China (25%) alone.34

Section 4.1.3. Comparing China with Western countries

34

As a result, the middle 40% income share is now similar in China vs. urban China: the top 10%
income share is higher in China than in urban China, the bottom 50% income share is lower, leaving
the share of the middle 40% at about 43%-44% in both cases in recent years (Figure 19).

30

Figure 21 compares our Chinese income inequality series with the series recently
computed for the United States by Piketty, Saez and Zucman (2016) and France by
Garbinti, Goupille and Piketty (2017). These series follow the same methodology as
the one applied in this paper; they all attempt to combine national accounts, surveys,
and fiscal data to estimate the distribution of pre-tax national income (including
undistributed profits and other tax-exempt capital income) among equal-split adults.
In the late 1970s, China used to be substantially more equal than France and the
United States. In the mid-2010s, it is more unequal than France (a country that is
broadly representative of European inequality levels), and is now approaching U.S.
inequality levels. While the top 10% income share rose from 27% to 41% in China
between 1978 and 2015, it increased in smaller proportions in the USA (from 35% to
47%), and only moderately in France (from 31% to 33%).

Despite its larger population, however, China remains significantly more equal than
the United States. The top 1% income share rose from 6% to 14% in China, while it
increased from 11% to 20% in the United States (Figure 22). The bottom 50%
income share is about 15% in China (20% in rural China, 25% in urban China), vs
12% in the United States and 22% in France (see Figure 23, and Figure 18 above).
Even urban China, an economy twice as populated as the United States, is
significantly more equal than the U.S.

Section 4.2. The distribution of economic growth

Our new series on the distribution of pre-tax national income allow us to decompose
growth by income group in a way that is fully consistent with macro growth. That is,

31

we can quantitatively assess the extent to which the various groups of the population
have benefitted from the enormous growth of China.

Figure 27 and Table 3 compare the distribution of 1978–2015 real income growth in
China, the United States, and France. Macro growth has obviously been different in
the three countries. Average per adult national income has been multiplied by more
than 9 in China (corresponding to an average annual increase of 6.2%), while it has
increased by 59% in the USA and by 39% in France. In China and the United States,
growth accruing to the bottom 50% has been smaller than macro growth (and equal
to macro growth in France), while growth accruing to the top 10% has been larger—
even more so if one looks at the top 1% and smaller groups up to the top 0.001%. In
China, average income for the top 0.001% has been multiplied by almost 40 since
1978 (+3817%, vs +811% for macro growth) and in the US the top 0.001% has been
multiplied by almost 8 (+685%, vs +59% for macro growth).

The key difference between China and the United States is that in China the bottom
50% also benefited enormously from growth: the average income of the bottom 50%
was multiplied by more than 5 in real terms between 1978 and 2015, which is less
than macro growth and top income growth, but still very substantial. Presumably this
increase can make rising inequality much more acceptable, especially for a country
starting from very low living conditions—at least until a certain point. In contrast,
bottom 50% income growth has been negative in the United States (-1%).

In our view, these findings illustrate the usefulness of distributional national accounts.
Looking at macroeconomic growth is not enough: it is critical to be able to

32

decompose growth across income quantiles, to be able to analyze which social
groups benefit—or not—from it.

Section 4.3. Wealth inequality

Table 4 reports statistics on the distribution of wealth in 2015, obtained by combining
wealth surveys with data from the annual Hurun rankings that cover the wealthiest
Chinese households. Average wealth reaches 282,000 yuans per adult in 2015,
about 5 times average income. That is, as studied in Section 3 above, the private
wealth to national income ratio is around 500%. Like in other countries, wealth is
significantly more concentrated than income: the top 10% share is 67% for wealth,
versus 41% for income. The top 0.001% alone—the 10,653 richest adults with net
wealth above €66 million—owns 5.8% of total wealth, about as much as the bottom
50%—the 531 million poorest adults.

Figures 20 shows that, consistent with the trend for income inequality, wealth
concentration has sharply increased. The top 10% wealth share increased from 40%
in 1995 to 67% in 2015, while the middle 40% and bottom 50% wealth shares
collapsed. As a result, while wealth inequality used to be much lower in China than in
the Western world in the mid-1990s, it is now intermediate between Europe and the
United States (Figure 28). The Chinese top 10% wealth share (67% in 2015) is
getting close to that of the United States (72%) and is much higher than in a country
like France (50%). The bottom 50% wealth share is now barely higher than in rich
countries, where it is usually around 0%–5%.

33

We stress that despite our best efforts, these series must still be viewed as
provisional and imperfect. We believe that our corrected income and wealth
inequality estimates for China are more satisfactory and plausible than previous
estimates, but they are surely not meant to be the last word on the issue. Looking
forward, progress could be made in at least three directions. First, more detailed
fiscal data would make it possible to revise our top 1% income share for recent
years—possibly upward and by a significant margin.35 Second, our current estimates
disregard tax evasion There is evidence that a growing amount of wealth is held
abroad by wealthy Chinese households (Zucman, 2014, 2015). Our current series do
not incorporate these assets, neither in the national wealth totals, nor in our
distributional estimates. Incorporating these offshore assets and the income they
generate could lift the top shares significantly (Alstadsæter, Johannesen and
Zucman, 2017). Last, Hong Kong and Macao are excluded from all our macro and
micro data. This could lead us to underestimate the rise of inequality, and ought to be
taken into account in future research.

Section 5. Concluding Comments and Perspectives

By combining and confronting Chinese national accounts, surveys, wealth rankings,
and tax data (including recently released income tax data covering high earners), we
obtain two main findings. First, the property structure in China is that of mixed
economy, with a large share of public property: about 30% of national wealth in 2015

35

Using the 2011 CHFS survey data, a recent study (Tan, Zeng, and Zhu, 2017) finds a top 1 percent
income share in China as large as 23.8% in 2010, much higher than our estimate for 2010, 15.1%.
Given the imperfections of the available tax data, we certainly cannot rule out the possibility that the
top 1% income share in China could be over 20%. However, after carefully studying the 2011 CHFS
data, we have several reasons to suspect that this result is driven by outliers, limited sample size and
issues related to sampling design; see the online Appendix Section B.2.

34

belongs to the government, including about 60% of domestic corporate equity. This is
larger than the share of public property in the Western mixed economies of the postWorld War 2 decades, though not far from it. The public share has stopped declining
since 2007-2008 and might be a long-lasting feature of the Chinese economy.

Second, income inequality has increased substantially since the beginning of the
reform process. China used to be more equal than Europe in the late 1970s—about
as equal as the most egalitarian Nordic countries—while it is now approaching U.S.
inequality levels. Despite this rise, inequality remains lower than in the United States
today, which given the size of China and the large gaps between its rural and urban
regions is striking.

An interesting question is the extent to which these two findings—declining but still
high public ownership; rising income inequality, but less than in the United States—
are related. China’s mixed economy structure might contribute to mitigating the rise
of inequality. We leave a quantitative analysis of how public property, taxes, public
services, and welfare spending shape the distribution of income in China to future
research

Has inequality gone too far in China? The evidence compiled in this paper is
obviously not sufficient to provide answers to such a complex issue. However, at the
very least, our findings indicate that there is a need for more transparency about
income and wealth. The recently released tax statistics on high earners lead us to
propose a large upward correction of official income inequality estimates. Improved
access to tax statistics could lead to further revisions. The current lack of

35

transparency about income and wealth data in China—and elsewhere—puts serious
limits to our collective ability to monitor inequality dynamics and design adequate
policy responses.
