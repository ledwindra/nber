ABSTRACT
We examine the differential impact of portfolio debt, portfolio equity, and FDI inflows on 37 manufacturing
industries, 99 countries, 1991-2007, extending Rajan-Zingales (1998). We utilize external finance
dependence measures in a series of cross-sectional regressions of manufacturing industries’ growth
rates covering 17 years. Net portfolio debt inflows are negatively associated with growth during the
mid 1990s. The magnitudes of the negative effect of surges in portfolio debt inflows on growth are
substantial in the late 1990s for a number of countries. The effect of debt inflows on growth in the
2000s is rather muted. Surges in portfolio equity inflows also exhibit a negative association with aggregate
growth in the manufacturing sector. For instance, the inflow surge during the financial liberalization
period, 1993-1994, is associated with a sharp decline in aggregate manufacturing sector growth, but
a rise in the growth of relatively more financially constrained industries. Equity inflows exhibited
economically significant positive impact on the growth of financially constrained industries, unlike
their negative impact on the average manufacturing growth rate. FDI inflows exhibit a positive association
with aggregate manufacturing growth during most of the sample period, both at the aggregate level
and specifically for the industries in need of external financing.

1. Introduction

In light of the broad trend of financial liberalization over the past two decades, one of the most
pressing questions has become the nature of the relationship between financial integration and economic
growth. Given the growing sophistication of financial instruments and players ranging from governments
and sovereign wealth funds to highly leveraged hedge funds, more recent research focuses on identifying
types of financial integration that enhance economic growth versus those that are destabilizing and
harmful. This line of research is particularly important from a macro-prudential perspective in the face of
the resurgence of massive capital inflows into emerging markets as these economies spearhead the
recovery from the 2008-09 global financial crisis. For instance, Canuto (2010) describes various dangers
from asset price overshooting caused by excessive foreign investor demand for emerging markets’ stocks,
bonds, real estate, and other financial assets. Another channel through which surges in capital inflows
heighten financial and macroeconomic risk has been noted as early as Diaz-Alejandro (1985), who argued
that increased private capital inflows, especially in the form of debt, lead to lending booms and bust
cycles; Reinhart and Reinhart (2009) find a robust empirical association between surges in financial
capital inflows and banking crises, and Cowan and Raddatz (2011) find that industries that are more
dependent on external finance decline significantly more during a sudden stop, especially in less
financially developed countries.
Overall, the impact of financial openness and capital mobility on economic growth remains a
contentious issue. Gourinchas and Jeanne (2006) found that measured welfare gains from switching from
financial autarky to perfect capital mobility are negligible relative to the potential welfare gain of a takeoff in domestic productivity of the magnitude observed in some of these countries. Prasad, Rajan, and
Subramanian (2007) found that, contrary to the predictions of standard theoretical models, non-industrial
countries that have relied more on foreign finance have not grown faster in the long run. While the
patterns of foreign direct investment flows have generally been more in line with the predictions of
theory, there is no evidence that providing additional financing in excess of domestic savings is the
channel through which financial integration delivers its benefits. Looking at the contribution of the
current account towards financing growth, Aizenman, Pinto and Radziwill (2007) concluded that most of
the economic growth of developing and emerging markets was self-financed.
However, much of the previous empirical work suffers from two important shortcomings. First, not
enough attention has been paid to the differential effects of different types of capital flows. For instance,
in addition to portfolio debt, it is important to consider FDI, which comprises almost 40 percent of private
inflows into developing countries. Notably, the fastest-growing emerging markets, such as China,
received the most FDI over the period 1970–2004 (Prasad, Rajan and Subramanian (2007)). Focusing on
1

banking crises, Joyce (2010) looks at stock while Caballero (2010) examines flow measures of debt,
equity, and FDI separately and their effects on the economic conditions of recipient countries. Both
studies find a robust positive association of crises with portfolio debt inflows, but a less robust and mostly
negative association with FDI. Second, as Prasad, Rajan and Subramanian (2007) point out, it is difficult
to establish a causal relationship between private financial capital inflows and growth using
macroeconomic data. This paper attempts to provide a richer picture of the relationship between private
capital inflows and growth by rectifying these gaps.
Using both cross-country and within-country variation, this study examines the differential impact of
three broad types of financial capital inflows – portfolio debt, portfolio equity, and FDI – on
manufacturing industry growth in a large sample of countries. Second, we evaluate whether and how each
type of financial capital inflows affects the development of industrial sectors that are most in need of
external finance.
The bulk of the study consists of cross-sectional regressions of manufacturing industries’ growth rates
on a set of industry and country controls across 37 manufacturing industries in up to 99 countries over the
years 1991 through 2007. Data on net capital inflows allow us to explore cross-country variation, while
the interaction of country-level inflows with sector-level variation in the need for external finance allows
us to explore cross-sector responses to the shocks in financial capital inflows. Also, we track the evolution
of these relationships over time by rolling the regressions forward over a 17-year period. Finally, we
evaluate the economic impact of key variables focusing on key developing countries and an economy
representative of the European periphery.
We find substantial differences between the first order effects of portfolio debt, portfolio equity, and
FDI inflows on industrial growth. The coefficients on net portfolio debt inflows are negative and
significant in the late 1990s (during the run-up to the Asian Financial Crisis) and to some degree in 2000s.
The economic magnitudes of the negative effect of surges in portfolio debt inflows on growth are quite
substantial in the late 1990s for a number of countries. For instance, in 1996 the surge of portfolio debt
inflows to Korea is on average associated with a 4 percent lower value added growth rate of
manufacturing industries in that country. However, the size of the economic effect of debt inflows on
growth in 2000s is rather muted and the transmission to the growth of financially constrained industries
within manufacturing is low. Surges in portfolio equity inflows also exhibit a negative relationship with
aggregate growth of the manufacturing sector. The first major surge during our sample period takes place
during the broad financial liberalization in 1993-1994 and is associated with a sharp decline in the
aggregate manufacturing sector growth (but a rise in the growth of relatively more financially constrained
industries). Going from 1993 to 1994 regressions, the coefficients on net portfolio inflows change from
either positive or insignificant to statistically significant estimates in the range of -5.0 to -6.0. The
2

economic magnitude of the impact of equity inflows on the four focus countries was pronounced. A 1
percent of GDP equity inflow surge in Korea and 2 percent of GDP surge in Chile around 1994 were
associated with an approximately 5 percent decline in the manufacturing sector value added growth rate
in both countries. The coefficient estimates on equity inflows were also persistently negative and
significant during 1999 - 2005, with the actual inflows into the focus group countries (Chile, China,
Korea, and Turkey) showing a persistent negative impact on manufacturing sector growth. In contrast to
debt inflows, equity inflows also exhibited a statistically and economically significant impact specifically
on the growth of financially constrained industries, but in the opposite direction than their impact on the
average manufacturing growth rate. Most notably, the 1994 surge in equity inflows that is associated with
a decline in the growth rate of aggregate manufacturing output was associated with a higher growth rate
of sectors with external financing needs one standard deviation above the average.
Finally, FDI inflows exhibit a positive association with aggregate manufacturing growth during most
of the sample period, with the volumes of inflows into individual countries such that a significant positive
economic impact is observed in all selected countries under consideration both at the aggregate level and
specifically for the industries in need of external financing. The time-series plots of an economic impact
proxy constructed using regression coefficients on net FDI inflows and net FDI inflows interacted with
sector-level external financing needs show a stable positive relationship with growth over time, especially
in the 1999-2005 period.

2. Data

2.1 External Finance Dependence
We proxy for external finance dependence at the industry level during 1991 through 2007 following
Rajan and Zingales (1998) using COMPUSTAT data. The sample period corresponds to the 17 years
beginning with the broad financial liberalization following the collapse of the Soviet Union and ending
prior to the global financial crisis and recession of 2008-09. We construct an external financial
dependence measure as the difference between capital expenditures and cash flow from operations,
divided by capital expenditures. For cash flows statements with format codes 1, 2, and 3, cash flow from
operations is constructed as simple cash flow from operations plus decrease in inventories plus decrease
in receivables plus increase in payables. For cash flows statements with format code 7, we construct cash
flow from operations as the sum of income before extraordinary items, depreciation and amortization,
deferred taxes, equity in net loss, sale of property, plant and equipment and investments, and funds from
operations. Table A1 shows the formula explicitly along with the names and COMPUSTAT locators of
the relevant cash flow items. In order to control for short-term business cycle effects, we compute a
3

backward looking measure as the 5-year average of the following ratio: 5-year sum of financing shortfall
of cash flow from operations divided by the 5-year sum of capital expenditures. We construct the measure
for 1991 through 2007 (subject to data availability), each year taking the industry median. Finally, each
year we standardize the measure such that it has zero mean and unit variance to generate EXF(std). This
last step greatly simplifies the interpretation of the regression coefficients on variables interacted with
industry external financing needs while preserving the relative ranking across industries every year. Table
A2 lists the industries along with the 1991 through 2007 average of external financing needs.
Pharmaceuticals exhibit the highest dependence on external finance, followed by a number of chemical
and heavy industries such a shipping and steel manufacturers, while on average lighter industries such as
apparel and electronics tend to be less reliant on external financing.
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to utilize an external finance dependence measure
in a time-series context. In contrast to Rajan and Zingales (1998) who construct the measure for 1980s
and Tong and Wei (2009) who expand their approach to 1990 through 2006, we use shorter 5 year
periods constructing a backward looking measure each year. Potential merits of this approach are
illustrated in Figure A1 which shows the time-series of external finance dependence for selected
industries. The plots show that relative external financing needs of a sector can vary substantially: the
standardized external finance measure for the manufacturers of plastics and rubber rose significantly
during mid and late 1990s while the external financial dependence of petroleum refineries gradually
declined from significantly above to below the cross-section mean between 1995 and 2005. The change in
the proxy of external finance dependence of primary iron and steel manufacturers (bottom panel) is even
more striking, rising up to 6 standard deviations during early 2000s.

2.2 Industry Level Variables
Table A2 lists definitions and sources of the variables used. We obtain data on industry level output
in local currency and value added from the United Nations Industrial Development Organization
(UNIDO) Industrial Statistical Database. We use this data to construct the dependent variable as the 5year average annual growth rate of output (yg_5yavg) and 5-year average annual growth rate of value
added (va_5yavg) for each of the 37 industries in 106 countries.1 Table 4 lists the countries used in the
study while Table 5 lists the manufacturing industries under consideration. We then merge the UNIDO
country panel with COMPUSTAT industry panel using ISIC Rev 2 3-digit codes (in contrast to the 2-

The measure of output covers the value of census output of activities of an industrial nature while the value added
measure is defined as the value of census output less the value of census inputs. For detailed definitions see a guide

digit codes used by Rajan and Zingales (1998)), giving us the relationship between external financing
needs and growth rate for 37 manufacturing industry groups in each country.2

2.3 Country-Industry Interaction Variables
We examine the effects of different types of financial linkages at a disaggregated level. Focusing on
the broadest set of countries for which both UNIDO and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
International Financial Statistics (IFS) data are available, we obtain annual data from 1985 through 2007
on portfolio equity, portfolio debt, and direct investment flows from the IFS database. Net inflows
calculated as the difference between annual liability and asset flows in each category. All the variables are
normalized by GDP and converted to 5-year averages so as to eliminate any short-term business cycle
effects. In order to evaluate how each type of private capital inflow contributes to the growth of
financially constrained industries, we interact each capital inflow variable with external finance
dependence of each industry generating debtk × EXF(std)j, equityk × EXF(std)j, and FDIk × EXF(std)j,
respectively. Finally, as discussed in Rajan and Zingales (1998), an additional explanatory variable that
varies at both industry and country level is the share of value added of industry j in total manufacturing
value added of country k. We use 5-year average of this ratio in the regressions (value added sharej,k).

2.4 Additional Country Controls
We obtain country-level data from WDI. We obtain data on economic openness defined as the sum of
annual export and import volume as a percentage of GDP (openness), general government consumption
as a percentage of GDP (govtcons), annual percentage change in consumer prices (inflation), secondary
school enrollment rate among male population (schooling), infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births
(mortality), and logarithm of total births per woman (fertility), private sector credit to GDP ratio
(privatecredit), and gross domestic savings to GDP ratio (savings). As with the financial flows, these
controls enter as 5-year averages. Additional time invariant country-level controls include WDI ease of
doing business rank ranging from 1 to 183, 1 being most favorable (businessindex), regional dummies for
East Asia & Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and Caribbean , Middle East and North
Africa, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and income dummies for high income OECD, high income nonOECD, upper middle income, lower middle income, and low income countries. In the most restrictive
specification we use country dummies instead of country level controls.
2

COMPUSTAT data is grouped by NAICS US-2002 industry codes. In order to merge it with UNIDO data, we use
the NAICS to ISIC Rev 3.1 bridge, then use ISIC Rev 3.1 to ISIC Rev 2 bridge. UNIDO data itself comes in three
distinct batches organized by ISIC Rev 3 digit, ISIC Rev 2 3 digit, and ISIC Rev 2 4 digit codes. We consolidate and
merge all dataset by ISIC Rev 2 3 digit codes using correspondence provided at the UN Classification Registry
(http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/).

where each of the three types of net financial inflows in country k is interacted with external finance
dependence of sector j; bold letters indicate vector notation. For the baseline, instead of using country
dummies we include a comprehensive set of country level controls. The remaining set of controls follows
the initial methodology, with industry level dummies. Conditional on the comprehensive set of country
level controls, this specification allows us to identify potential financial “bottlenecks” by separating the
direct impact of financial inflows on industry growth from the impact weighted by the industry’s need for
external finance. For robustness, we also consider a more restrictive specification with country and
industry dummies:

4. Results
4.1 Summary Statistics and Correlation Analysis
Before proceeding with regression analysis we examine summary statistics and correlations between
the measures of manufacturing sector growth at the country level and each type of private capital inflow.
Table 1 shows summary statistics for 5-year averages of each capital inflow type to GDP ratios (debt,
equity, and FDI) as well as annual country means of the 5-year average annual growth rate of output
(yg_5yavg) and 5-year average annual growth rate of value added (va_5yavg). The average manufacturing
industry value added (output) growth rate among the 99 countries in the sample between 1991 and 2007
was 5.5 percent (6.2 percent) and exhibited considerable volatility with a standard deviation of 21.7
percent (25.6 percent). The summary statistics for private capital inflows show that FDI comprises the
6

most stable category. The average net portfolio debt, equity, and FDI inflows were 2.5, 1.1, and 4.1
percent of GDP respectively. Compared to output and value added growth net inflows of equity, debt, and
FDI also exhibit lower annual volatility (5.2, 2.6, and 5.5 percent of GDP respectively). Among the three
types of private capital flows, FDI exhibits the lowest volatility relative to the mean. Furthermore,
comparing the values in the minimum column for each capital inflow, the largest outflow for FDI was 4.8
percent of GDP compared to the largest outflows of 6.4 and 11.0 percent of GDP for portfolio equity and
debt. Table 2 shows pairwise correlations between average growth measures and private capital inflows,
with p-values underneath each correlation statistic. As expected, the two measure of industry growth
(value added growth and output growth) are highly correlated at the country level with correlation
coefficient of 0.87. The correlations between either measure of industrial growth and portfolio debt and
equity inflows are mostly negative and insignificant. In contrast, both value added and output growth
rates exhibit positive and statistically significant correlations with FDI inflows with correlation
coefficients at 0.05 and 0.06 respectively. Thus, summary statistics and pairwise correlations indicate that
FDI is the most stable of the three broad types of private capital inflows as well as the only one with a
statistically significantly positive correlation with manufacturing sector growth in the pooled sample
covering 99 countries over a 17 year period.
4.2 Regression Analysis
Tables 3 reports cross-sectional OLS regression results with heteroskedasticity robust standard errors
based on equation (1) for year 2007. The coefficients on 37 industry dummies have been omitted for
brevity. While the first order effect of FDI inflows on the average growth rate (captured by the
coefficients on FDI) is positive, the effect of FDI inflows is negative when interacted with industry
external finance dependence (FDI × EXF(std)). The magnitudes of 0.439 and -0.162 respectively in
specification (11) indicate that a 1 percent increase in the 5-year average net FDI inflows is associated
with a 0.4 percent higher average growth in the manufacturing sector overall, but a 0.16 percent lower
growth in industries with external finance dependence one standard deviation above the mean. The
coefficients are robust to the sequential inclusion of country level controls. The finding that in 2007 net
FDI inflows exhibited positive association with overall manufacturing sector growth rates but a negative
association with the growth of most financially constrained industries complements the results of Prasad,
Rajan, and Subramanian (2007). These authors find that while FDI did follow growth between 1970 and
2000 for the positive association was no longer there for 2000 through 2004 (the latest period in their

7

sample).3 Our results indicate that the negative association between FDI and growth following prolonged
periods of steady FDI inflows may be due to the way these inflows interact with external financing needs
of various industries. For instance, “green” FDI may compete for external financing with domestic firms
and, particularly in the case of emerging markets, may crowd out incumbent firms out of the local bank
lending. This hypothesis should be taken with caution, especially given other channels, such as added
competition in local labor markets, through which FDI may have an adverse effect on incumbent firms. In
addition, this special feature of FDI (in contrast to debt and equity) of acting both a source of financing as
well as source of demand for external financing, implies that FDI gestation period must be considered
when evaluating the association between direct investment and growth.
In contrast to FDI, while in most specifications the first order impact of net portfolio debt inflows on
growth is negative, the combined effect through an industry’s external finance dependence is positive and
significant at 10 percent level once a sufficient number of country controls is included in specifications
(8) through (11).
Table 4 reports cross-sectional OLS regression results with heteroskedasticity robust standard errors
based on equation (1) for selected time-periods in the 17 year sample. The dependent variable is 5-year
average value added growth rate of industry j in country k. The left-hand column in each time-period
includes only time-varying country level controls, while the right-hand column includes time invariant
controls: ease of doing business index, income dummies, and regional dummy variables. All
specifications include industry dummies.
Overall, the results indicate that most of the association between capital inflows into sectors heavily
reliant on external financing and value added growth takes place during the beginning and end of the
sample period. Moreover, the relative significance of different types of financial flows appears to switch
from direct investment to equity in the early 1990s back to direct investment to equity to portfolio debt
during the 2000s, while the magnitudes of coefficients on all three types of flows decline substantially
during the 17 year period.
Both the direct association and the association through interaction with external finance dependence
of FDI inflows with industry growth are negative during 1993 and 1994 period; however, the coefficients
on FDI (the direct measure) rise in significance and magnitude over the course of the two years (from 0.68 to -2.29) while the coefficients on the interaction term decline in both significance and magnitude
(from -1.40 to -1.20). During the same period, the coefficient on the interaction term of net equity inflows

3

See also Harrison, Love and McMillan (2004), finding that FDI is associated with a reduction in financing

constraints, and with lower sensitivity of investment to cash flow for firms without foreign assets and for
domestically owned enterprises.
8

(equity × EXF(std)) becomes positive and statistically significant at 4.38. This trend during the early
1990s may indicate that, given the negative association between direct investment and value added
growth, externally financially dependent industries on average switched to equity financing. By 1998, the
interaction with neither flow is significant; however the direct association between portfolio equity
inflows and value added growth is positive and significant. Combined with the lack of corresponding
joint impact with external finance dependence at industry level, the results in 1998 regression
(specification (6)) may indicate a bottleneck formed by excessive reliance on equity financing during the
prior years. By 2001 we observe another switch, with FDI inflows taking on positive coefficients in the
direct as well as the interaction term with external financing dependence, indicating another possible
trend toward financing by direct investment given the potential bottleneck in equity financing in the years
prior. By 2003 the coefficient on the interaction term of equity inflows is marginally significant and is for
the first time replaced by positive joint association with external financing needs and portfolio debt in
2007. The directions of such frequent oscillations between debt, equity, and direct investment financing
of growth in externally financially dependent industries is consistent with herding from one type of
financing to another as “bottlenecks” are repeatedly formed when one source takes too much precedence
over the other. 4
Figure 1 plots the coefficient estimates on the interaction terms between external finance dependence
and debt, equity, and FDI inflows respectively, using cross-sectional regressions each year from 1991
through 2007 based on the full specification (11). As the regression results in Table 4 suggest, the impact
of different types of financial flows on the growth of industries most dependent on external financing
varies over time. During 2000s the precision of the estimates of the joint association with portfolio debt
inflows, external finance dependence, and growth improves and the coefficient takes on statistically
significant positive values toward the end of the sample period. During the early to mid-90s most of the
positive association comes from equity inflows, with FDI exhibiting negative effect. However, during late
1990s the coefficient on the interaction with FDI inflows (FDI × EXF(std)) gradually rises and reaches a
positive and statistically significant value by 2001, while over the same period the coefficient on the
interaction of external finance dependence with equity inflows falls to zero. The coefficient on FDI ×
EXF(std) then declines in middle 2000s taking on negative values by 2006 and 2007. Such trend is

4

Table 5 reports analogous regression results with output growth replacing value added growth as the

dependent variable. In this specification the results of the interaction of financial flows with external finance
dependence at industry level for 2003 and 2007 are robust, however, using this measure we fail to capture the impact
of flows on industry growth during earlier periods.

9

consistent with the gradual decline of (and even perverse) impact of FDI inflows on industrial growth due
to the possible currency overvaluation effect, as noted in Prasad, Rajan, and Subramanian (2007).
Moving to the consistency of controls, the coefficient on privatecredit turns from positive in 1994 to
insignificant during the middle part of the sample to negative and significant at 1 percent by 2007. The
coefficients on schooling and government consumption, while mostly negative, are also unstable.
Consistent with higher fertility being a proxy for lower productivity through lower opportunity cost of
bearing children, the coefficient on this variable is mostly negative (except for the 1998 regression) and
the coefficient on savings to GDP ratio is positive and significant in most specifications consistent with
neoclassical growth theory. The coefficient on inflation is mostly positive, potentially capturing periods
of economic expansion, while the coefficient on openness tends to take on negative values, indicating that
greater openness through trade in goods and services is associated with lower manufacturing growth rate
(perhaps capturing a type of “churning” phenomenon, as we only consider traditional manufacturing, not
service industries). Finally, consistent with common priors, the association between greater difficulty of
doing business (higher value of the businessinex) and value added growth is negative.
Table 6 replaces country-level controls with country dummies, thus representing the most restrictive
specification, and reports results for selected cross sections from 1993 through 2007. By using dummies
for both country and industry, this specification isolates the variation in industry growth due to financial
inflows only attributable to external financial dependence. The positive association with equity inflows in
2003 is present when using either output or value added growth as the dependent variables, 0.130 and
0.092 respectively. The value added specifications also show consistent results with regressions using
country level controls reported in Table 6 with positive effect of FDI inflows in 2001 turning negative by
2007, as well as a negative coefficient on portfolio debt inflows in 2003. The positive effect of debt
inflows in 2007 is only present in the output growth but not value added growth specification (although
the t-stat in value added specification is approximately 1.5 indicating only marginal insignificance).
Overall, the comparison of results of Tables 4 and 5 with Table 6 indicates that some of the joint impact
of financial flows and dependence on external finance on industry growth during the earlier part of the
sample period may also be driven by cross-country variations, while the same associations in the 2000s
appear to be mostly a function of the dependence on external financing alone.

4.3 Economic Impact in Selected Countries
To illustrate the economic significance of private capital inflows on industrial growth we focus on a
few specific countries. We pick three emerging market economies, Chile, China, and Korea, and one
economy representative of European periphery which is not at the heart of the current European debt
crisis, Turkey. The choice of the three emerging markets is motivated by their diverse growth strategies
10

and economic characteristics. Chile is a commodity exporter with open capital markets; China is pursuing
export oriented growth accompanied by strict capital controls; and Korea is highly financially integrated
with the rest of the world and has been subject to a number of surges in capital inflows, financial crises,
and varying capital control policies during the 17 year sample period.
Figures 2 through 4 plot the economic magnitudes of the estimates for selected countries for portfolio
debt, portfolio equity, and FDI inflows respectively from 1991 through 2007. The top panel of each graph
plots the regression coefficient on the interaction term multiplied by net financial inflows into a country in
a given year; the middle panel plots the regression coefficient on debt, equity, and FDI multiplied by the
value of each net inflow into a country in a given year. The bottom panels show the actual volume of the
respective financial capital inflows relative to GDP.5 Specifically, the values on the vertical axis of the top

panel of each graph are calculated by multiplying the regression coefficient on 7  ×  ;,

7  ×  ;, or 7  ×  ; term by the value of the total financial inflow in each
category into country k in year t. This yields the estimate of the impact of financial inflows in each of the

three categories on value added growth rate of sectors with external finance dependence 1 standard
deviation above the mean (relatively dependent, with EXFt(std)=1). In contrast, the middle panels plot the
average impact of equity, debt, and FDI inflows on the manufacturing value added growth rate.
Focusing on porfolio debt (Figure 2), the estimates show the emergence of a significantly positive
association between net portfolio debt inflows and growth rates of industries with high (one standard
deviation above the mean) external financing needs in 2006 and 2007. For instance, in Chile and Korea
the magnitude of the average portfolio debt inflows was such that it translated into half a percentage point
higher growth rate in manufacturing value added in 2007. At 0.2 percentage points the comparable
contribution was lower in China, consistent with its lower reliance on debt financing. Comparing top and
middle panels, the contribution of debt inflows to overall growth rate exhibits higher volatility than the
contribution to sectors in higher need of external financing. During the run-up to the Asian financial
crisis, Korea exhibited a highly negative association between debt inflows and overall value added growth
(up to -4 percentage points), while the comparable association with sectors characterized by greater
financial dependence shows a remarkable rise in standard errors with point estimates remain close to zero.
Thus, while the first order negative impact of surge in“hot money” inflows prior to the Asian financial
crisis was felt in the overall manufacting, the second order impact (higher volatility) was more of a
feature for financially constrained industries. As once possible explanation, to the extent that FDI inflows

Note that unlike the series used in the regression, the series in the bottom panels of Figures 2 through 4 has not
been smoothed, thus allows us to overlay predictions from cross-sectional regression results with any surges in
capital inflows that took place during the 1991 to 2007 period.

are associated with real appreciation (Prasad, Rajan, and Subramanian (2007)), the resulting loss of
competitiveness, especially in the exporting sector, may outweigh the benefits of additional financing.
In contrast to portfolio debt inflows, which overall exibit a positive association over time between the
impact on industry growth through external financing channel and overall impact on the average growth
rate of all manufacturing sectors, Figure 3 shows that the same association is negative for portfolio equity
inflows. The positive spike in the impact of equity inflows on growth of external financing dependent
sectors around 1994 (seen here in Chile, Korea, and Turkey) is associated with a negative spike in the
association between equity inflows and the average manufacturing growth in a country. The data become
available for China only in 1996, but consistent with the other three countries under consideration, the
series in the top and bottom panels exhibit negative association, with the decline in the impact of equity
inflows on the growth of externally financially dependent industries accompanied by a rise in the impact
of equity inflows on the average manufacturing growth rate.
In addition to the negative co-movement between the series, the much smaller magnitude of
economic impact of equity inflows on growth of externally financially dependent sectors relative to the
industry average growth in case of China, and to some extent Korea, points at the relative insulation of
industries reliant on external financing in those countries from the aggregate fluctuations in portfolio
equity inflows. The point estimate for China on the impact on externally financially dependent industries
fluctuates between -0.2 and 0.1 percent points compared to -1.0 to 1.0 fluctuations in the impact on the
aggregate growth rate (top and bottom panel of China graph, Figure 3). This finding is consistent with
high degree of capital controls pertaining to “hot money” in China compared to say Chile during our
sample period.
Figure 4 shows that, unlike equity flows, the impact of FDI inflows on industry growth through
the external financing channel and their aggregate impact show a high degree of positive co-movement
over time. In addition, with the exception of Turkey, the magnitude of the impact of FDI inflows through
the external financing channel is an order of magnitude higher than the impact of debt inflows shown in
Figure 2. The estimates for all four countries show that the positive association between FDI inflows and
aggregate manufacturing sector growth was sustained from around 1998 through 2005, and some of this
impact was channeled towards the more financially constrained industries. For instance, the 2001
estimates for Chile show that, all else equal, FDI inflows translated into approximately 10 percent growth
rate of manufacturing on average (middle panel), while only 5 percent in the more constrained portion of
the sector (top panel). Similar pattern is observed for other countries under consideration, suggesting
some possible inefficiencies in the channeling of FDI inflows to the sectors with the greater self-financing
short-falls.

5. Conclusion

We examine the differential impact of portfolio debt, portfolio equity, and FDI inflows on 37
manufacturing industries in 99 countries over the 1991-2007 period, extending Rajan-Zingales (1998).
We utilize external finance dependence measure in a series of cross-sectional regressions of
manufacturing industries’ growth rates covering 17 years. We find that debt and equity inflows have at
best mixed association with growth, and tend to be associated with negative growth effects for large
surges. FDI is the most stable of the three broad types of private capital inflows as well as the only one
with a statistically significantly positive correlation with manufacturing sector growth. However, in line
with existing empirical literature, we also find a negative association between FDI and growth following
prolonged periods of steady FDI inflows into a country. This may be due to the way these inflows interact
with external financing needs of various industries. For instance, “green” FDI may compete for external
financing with domestic firms and, particularly in the case of emerging markets, may crowd out
incumbent firms out of the local bank lending. Extending analysis over time to externally financially
dependent industries, we find frequent oscillations between debt, equity, and direct investment financing
of growth in externally financially dependent industries. Such finding may be an evidence of herding
from one type of financing to another as “bottlenecks” are repeatedly formed when one source takes too
much precedence over the other. In sum, the study suggests that unregulated financial flows have mixed
effects on the overall performance of the real sectors in emerging markets and developing countries.
