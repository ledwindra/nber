    "abstract": "\n\nWe develop a model for analyzing the sovereign debt crises of 2010\u20132013 in the Eurozone.  The government sets its expenditure-debt policy optimally.  The need to sell large quantities of bonds every period leaves the government vulnerable to self-fulfilling crises in which investors, anticipating a crisis, are unwilling to buy the bonds, thereby provoking the crisis.  In this situation, the optimal policy of the government is to reduce its debt to a level where crises are not possible.  If, however, the economy is in a recession where there is a positive probability of recovery in fiscal revenues, the government may optimally choose to \u201cgamble for redemption,\u201d running deficits and increasing its debt, thereby increasing its vulnerability to crises.\n\n",
