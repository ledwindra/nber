BANK EXPOSURE, CAPITAL AND SECONDARY MARKE DISCOUNTS
ON DEVELOPING COUNTRY DEBT

ABST RACT

Previous empirical studies of secondary market discounts for developing countries

have ignored important creditor country factors. The empirical evidence in this paper
indicates that, after controlling for repayment indicators of borrower countries, bank exposure
and capital are important determinants of secondary market discounts: an increase in the
exposure of large banks to a particular country leads to a decrease in the secondary market

discounts on the debt of that country, while an increase in the capital of large banks leads to
an increase in secondary market discounts. Among the repayment indicators of developing

countries, only debt ratios are found to be significant determinants of the discounts. We
suggest that the impacts of exposure and capital can be explained by the presence of deposit

insurance. l'he evidence presented on the stock market pricing of lender banks supports this
view.

large discounts. The magnitude of these discounts is considtred to reflect a

lack of confidence that the debts will ever be fully repaid, since

secondary

market prices are regarded as indicators of the value of the outstanding debt.

In an attempt to understand the factors that influence the value of a
country's outstanding debt empirical studies have primarily focused on
economic characteristics of borrower countries that presumably affect their
repayment prospects, such as GN? per capita, and the debt—to—exports ratio.1
Some puzzles concerning the patterns of secondary market discounts,
however, remain to be explained: loans to countries with large conatercial bank

debt, such as Brazil and Mexico, sell at lower discounts than loans to smaller
debtors; debt prices fell during the eighties, even though countries were

making large repayments. Other developments of the period suggest that
characteristics of the creditors could provide some explanations for these

puzzles. In particular, during the eighties the position of commercial banks
changed substantially. banks strengthened their capital, and engaged in
significant amounts of interbank loan trading, changing the composition of

See for example Berg and Sachs (1989), Cohen (1988) Hajivassiliou
(1988), Huizinga (1989), Sachs and iluizinga (1987). These variables are
considered to he among the empirical measures suggested by the theoretical
literature. For example seizure technology of the lenders, impatience of
various parties, the importance of future credit market access are suggested
as determinants of the value of debt (see Eaton and Cersovitz (1981), and
Bulow and Rogoff (I989b)).

The

of trading in the secondary market 2

objecLive of this paper is to better understand the determinants of

secondary market discounts and provide an explanation for these puzzles. For

this

purpose, we focus on a set of factors omitted by existing

studies of

secondary market pricing of debt. In particular, we conduct an empirical
analysis to determine if the degree of exposure and the size of the regulatory
capital of the lender banks have an impact on secondary market discounts. We

consider the largest nine US banks. The data for exposure of these banks to
individual countries and their total capital are quarterly for the period of

1986—1988. There are 41 countries in the sample, and the debt of 21 of these

countries has been traded in the secondary market. In order to address
potential problems due to sample selection we use a one step maximum

likelihood estimation procedure. In the estimation process we attempt to
control for countries' repayment prospects by using economic indicators of
borrower countries, in particular, their debt ratios.

Our primary findings are that bank exposure and capital are indeed

important determinants of discounts. The impacts of these variables are
substantial and they explain a significant component of the variation of

discounts across countries and over time, Specifically, a 4.1 billion 1986 US
dollars increase in the exposure of the )arge banks to a country is estimated
to reduce discounts by more than 10

We consider the largest nine US banks (size is measured by asset
value). The sample mean of exposure to the 21 countries with traded debts is
2.7 billion in 1986 dollars, with a standard deviation of 4.1. The mean of

country

discounts by near)y 15 cents on the dollar. The only borrowing
repayment indicators that: systcmatfcally

significant

have a statistically

impact on discounts are various measures of the debt ratio, such

as debt to exports and debt to CNP.

We suggest that bank deposit insurance provides an explanation for our
results. Deposit insurance premia are flat rate premia and in particular do

not reflect the riskiness of a bank's asset portfolio. Hence, deposit
insurance encourages risk taking. Banks' incentives to take risk decrease
with their rate of capitalization, since the expected subsidy from the deposit

insurance agency is reduced. This suggests that increased exposure to a
country leads to a decline (increase) in the secondary market discounts
(prices), and that increased capitalization leads to an increase in secondary

market discounts. This view appears consistent with the evidence for the

period. In particular, the smaller regional banks (which are typically better
capitalized) used the secondary market to reduce their developing country
exposure.

The negative relationship between bank exposure and secondary market
discounts could stem from the behavior of the multilateral lending agencies

and large creditor country governments. Since these institutions are
concerned with financial stability, they may provide loans to especially large

borrowers to enhance their repayment prospects. While we cannot rule out

this

alternative by an investigation of secondary market pricing, we provide
evidence from the stock market that favors the deposit insurance explanation.

discounts for this group is 47.35 with a stadard deviation of 22.7. The
average capital aggregate of the large banks over the 1986—88 period is 47
billion 1986 US dollars, with a standard deviation of 2.7.

4

Alternatively, large banks may be argued simply to have chosen to lend to
the higher quality borrowers in the first place, or they may have chosen to

syndicate a smaller share of high quality loans. Our results, however, are
obtained after controlling for creditworthiness indicators of borrowers. In
particular, we are careful to control for alternative measures of debt ratios,
such as debt—to—exports, and debt—to—GNP.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains
the empirical investigation of secondary market discounts. Section 3 provides
a discussion of potential explanations of the empirical findings as well as an

evaluation of evidence on the stock market valuation of bank assets. Section
4 concludes

Do Bank Exposure and Capital Affect Secondary Narket Discounts?

2.1 Methodology
In the secondary market for developing country loans, debts of only some

countries have been traded. The discounts on loans are observed for those
countries with debts traded in this market. This suggests that a sample
selection model is the correct specification of the determination of

discounts. We leave the discussion of the explanatory variables and the
sample characteristics to the next section, and first describe the selection
model consisting of the following equations:

(1)

D —1X+ u1

If instead ordinary least squares is used the resulting estimates could
be biased.

Discounts are observed when an underlying variable T* crosses seine threshold

This model is a standard sample selection model, where the error terms
are assumed to have a bivariate normal distribution, with standard deviations

model in one step maximum likelihood procedure. The identification condition
for the equations require that as below there be one element of X' that is not
in X. Alternatively, one coulc( rely on the nonlinearity of the fitted
probabilities in the selection equation to identify the parameters of the
model.

2.2 Specification and Data
The impact of bank exposure and bank capital on the secondary market
discounts is investigated using the discount equation (1) and the probit
specification of trading in the secondary market as described in equation (2).

See Beckman (1979) for a discussion of selection models.

6

Our data consists of quarterly information on 41 developing countries, based

on data availability, for the period of 1986—88. The debts of 21 countries
were traded at a discount. In this section we discuss the variables and the
data used in this analysis.

Equation (1) is a reduced form specification of the equilibrium prices in

the secondary market. Hence, the explanatory variables should incorporate all
the exogenous factors influencing lender and borrower behaviour. These
include pertinent economic indicators of borrower countries, which have been
used in several empirical studies addressing various issues concerning

developing country debt.6 The borrowing country indicators are attemtps to
measure the variables suggested by the theoretical literature such as costs a

defulting country suffers. A typical set of these indicators includes: debt—
to—exports ratio, reserves—to—imports ratio, real CNP per capita, and the rate

of inflation. Our base specification use these variables as country
indicators.7

This study introduces bank exposure and bank capital variables

into this equation.

In principle, some of the explanatory variables could be correlated with

the error term. For example, the exposure variable may be endogenous since
large discounts could affect the exposure of banks if write—offs are taken.

Real CNP per capita, and reserves—to—CNP could also be correlated with the

error term. To address this problem we used one quarter lagged values of the

6

Tabellini (1991).
'Berg and Sachs (1989) control for variables that are considered to
reflect the structural and political features of the borrowers such as share
of agriculture in GD? and a measure of income distribution. These variables
are available on a cross section basis. Ozler and Tabellini (1991) employ a
measure of political instability, which has annual frequency.

7

potentially endogenous explanatory variables.8

We also consider a

specification that uses only the beginning of the sample values for the
exposure variable.

Equation (2) incorporates all country indicators used in equation (1) and

a rescheduling agreement indicator. We expect that the latter variable will
influence the occurrence of trading. Almost all countries whose debt has been
traded have reached rescheduling agreements with commercial banks, unlike the

remaining countries.9 In contrast, we do not expect the occurrence of an
agreement to affect the magnitude of discounts. Consequently, our prior is
that this variable will serve well as an identifying variable. The
rescheduling agreement variable we employ for this purpose is a dummy variable
that takes the value of one if there was a rescheduling agreement with
commercial banks during the previous quarter.'°

To see how the countries with traded debts differ from the remaining
group we compare the means and standard errors of repayment indicators (as

presented in Table A.l in the Appendix). Overall, the repayment indicators
appear worse for the 21 countries with traded debts.

8Dealing with these concerns in an econometrically satisfactory way would
re,quire joint estimation of these variables with the discounts. It is
extremely difficult to do this with the roughly 400 observations we have.
Furthermore, a very complex system of structural equations would be required.

98 % of the countries with debts that are traded during 1986—88 reached
rescheduling agreements with creditor banks between 1978—86. Only 2 % of
countries whose debts were not traded during 1986—88 did not have any
rescheduling agreements with banks since the inception of such formal
agreements in the late l970s.
10 The mean value of this variable is .10 for the 21 country group with a
standard deviation of .3 (over the 12 quarters in 1986—88 period). For the
entire group the mean value is .005 with a standard deviation of .07.

8

The

mean discount for aU countries

1986—88 is 47.35

(with

with traded debts over the period

a standard deviation of 22.73) and the mean exposure is

2.74 billion 1986 US dollars (with a standard deviation of 4.14). The data
indicate that small borrowers, such as Bolivia, trade at relatively large
discounts. (Some summary information on secondary market discounts for the 21
countries with debts that trade at a discount and bank exposures for the 1986—
88 period are in Table A.2. in the Appendix.)

An important feature of the data is the pattern of secondary market
spreads, calculated as the percentage differences between the offer and bid

prices quoted in the secondary market. For countries with large discounts,
spreads also are quite large, which suggests an investigation of bid prices

alone may be potentially misleading. Accordingly, we employ secondary market
prices that are calculated using the average of bid and ask prices."
Alternatively, we use the spreads as an explanatory variable in a
specification that computes the discounts based on bid prices only.

2.3 Results
The primary results of our investigation are that increased bank exposure
leads to a decrease in secondary market discounts, and that increased
capitalization of banks leads to an increase in discounts, holding countries'

repayment prospects constant. In this section, we first discuss the
estimation results and then address a nuniber of sensitivity issues.

In Table I, the results from a maximum likelihood estimation of the

discount equation and the probit equation are presented. In the first column
we eiiiploy a set of base country indicators in both equations. These

inflation. In addition, the rescheduling agreement

Only debt to

affects the discounts significantly. In

contrast, the occurrence of trading is significantly affected by other country

repayment indicators, such as inflation rate and GNP per capita. The finding
that most country indicators do not affect secondary market prices is in
contrast to the role played by these indicators in studies of credit terms on
new loans and in predicting reschedulings.'2

In column 2 the rescheduling agreement variable is included in both

equations. As expected, the agreement variable appears to affect the
occurrence of trading in the secondary markets but not the magnitude of
discounts.

In column 3, we report results concerning exposure and capital, the

variables of primary interest for this study. The findings indicate that
exposure has a negative effect, and capital a positive impact on discounts.
Both parameters appear to be statistically significant.13

Incorporation of these variables leads to some different results which is

evident in a comparison of column 3 with the previous columns. Most important
of all is that incorporation of exposure and capital variablçs influences the

parameter estimates of reserves to imports ratio ?nd the real GNP, suggesting

Further investigation of various debt markets and instruments should
be undertaken to uncover the sources of this difference. The findings of
Stone (1991) are in accordance with ours as the author reports that the
changes in the secondary market prices are insensitive to changes in country
specific macro economic aggregates, such as exports, reserves and imports.
These findings continue to hold irrespective of whether identification
is addressed with the rescheduling variable, or simply by relying on
functional forms.

the presence of omitted varisbles bias in specifications that do not

incorporate these variables. Reserves to imports ratio is now estimated to be
a statistically significant determinsnt of discounts."
In addition, incorporation of the capital variable detracts from the
positive impact of year dummies on discounts reported in the previous

specifications. Finally, the magnitude of the constant is increased due to
the incorporation of the capital variable.'5

In column 4 the spread between the bid and ask prices is used as an
additional explanatory variable (where the discounts are calculated using the

bid prices). The impact of exposure and the impact of capital on discounts
are robust to this variation in the specification.

The impacts of exposure and capital on discounts are quite substantial.
Consider for example the estimates of —.16 and 6 for exposure and capital

respectively. Civen our sample these magnitudes imply the following: a 4.1
billion 1986 US dollars increase in the exposure of the large banks to a

country is estimated to reduce discounts by 11 cents on the dollar. A 2.7
billion 1986 US dollars increase in the capital of largest U.S. banks is found
to increase discounts by nearly 16 cents on the dollar.

2.4 Sensitivity Analysis
In order to investigate the robustness of our results, we attempt a

number of alternative specifications for the two equations. Our main
quantitative results continue to hold.

' For a discussion of the role of reserves in debt negotiations see
O'Connell (1989). That study suggests that the sign of the reserves variable
should be positive as it increases the bargaining power of borrowers vis—a—vis
banks, decreasing repayment prospects.
15 The sample mean of this variable (in its log form) is 17.6. An
estimated parameter value near 6.3 explains most of the jump in the constant.

11

In the specifications presented above the estimated correlation between
the error terms of the two equations is not 'arge and not statistically
significant as indicated by

p. This suggests that the evidence for sample

selection is not strong. We estimated these specifications with the ordinary
least squares (OLS) method for the countries whose debt were traded. The
point estimates of all the explanatory variables are smilar to the maximum
likelihood estimates (MLE).

procedure

The standard errors obtained using the OLS

are generally smaller than the ones obtained using the MLE

procedure. As a consequence, some of the country indicators that are not
found statistically significant in the HLE estimation are found significant at
low levels of confidence when OLS is used.

Debt to export ratio, exposure

and capital variables are the only variables that remain significant at high
levels of confidence, irrespective of the estimation procedure.

An alternative set of country repayment indicators are incorporated into

the analysis. In particular, we replace debt—to—exports and reserves—to—
imports with debt, reserves and imports all scaled by GM'. Exposure and
capital variables are estimated with nearly the same parameter values and

statistically significant at high levels of confidence. Debt to GNP ratio is
the only country indicator that is a significant determinant of spreads.
We investigate the impact of aJ.ternative dummy variable specifications

for time affects, such a using quarterly dummy variables, and dropping the
dummy

variables

entirely. None of these changes has any major impact on our

general findings.

Exposure to capital ratio is included in the probit equation. The
variable is found to have a statistically significant positive impact on the

12

occurrence of trading in the market. The results concerning the discount
equation are not influenced.
As banks have a significantly high exposure to Brazil and Mexico one
might suspect that having these countries in the sample drives our results.

Excluding them, however, does not change our qualitative findings. The impact
of exposure on discounts is estimated approximately one standard deviation

larger with a parameter estimate of —.20 and a standard error of .05.
One might argue that using only one lagged value of the exposure variable

does not properly address the potential endogeneity of this variable. We
replace the quarterly measure of the exposure variable with simply its

beginning of the sample value for each country. This renders it a constant
for each country, reflecting the exposure of banks one quarter prior to the

beginning of our sample period. All estimates stay nearly the same as our
base specification. The exposure is estimated to have a parameter value of
—.17 and a standard error of .05.

Finally, our results continue to hold when we employ exposure of a larger

set of banks. In particular, we replace the exposure and capital of the
largest 9 banks with the exposure and capital of the largest 24 U.S. banks.
The corresponding results are qualitatively similar to the ones reported, but
the exposure variable di,splays a smaller estimated parameter value.

3. Exolanation for the Results
In this section we suggest that our findings concerning the impact of
exposure and bank capital on discounts can be explained by deposit insurance.

We also consider other plausible explanations and provide further evidence to
support the view that deposit insurance is an explanation of our findings.

13

Deoosit Insurance
It has long been recognized that flat i.ate deposit insurance and

lunited

liability create incentives for banks to take excessive risk. For example,
with regard to banks' overexposure to developing countries, Penati and
Protopapadakis (1988) show that federal deposit insurance tends to subsidize
risky loans and that the subsidy increases with the riskiness of a bank's

loans. The authors suggest that deposit insurance explains the banks'
overexposure to developing countries and the earlier underpricing of loans.

Deposit insurance can similarly provide an explanation for the
relationship between bank exposure, capital and secondary market discounts.
Since the onset of the debt crisis, banks are no longer in the business of

making new loans to developing countries. Instead, banks may use the
secondary market as a means to alter their developing country loan porfolios.
The deposit insurance subsidy can be expected to increase with the riskiness

of a bank's developing country loan portfolio. Thus the banks have an
incentive to buy additional debts of those countries to which they already are
heavily exposed, and they may be willing to pay higher secondary market prices

for such loans.16 Regulatory capital affects secondary market prices in a
similar fashion. The particularly well capitalized banks are willing to pay
less for developing country debt. This is because, for these banks, the
expected 4eposit insurance agency payments are smaller and the cost of
obtaining them in case of bankruptcy is higher.
A look at stock market pricing of lender banks' shares provides
additional evidence for the views that the value of deposit insurance to banks

16 We do not observe complete specialization. One reason is that the
exposure of each bank to a country is restricted not to exceed 15% of bank
capital by regulatory agencies.

14

is substantial. Several studies have found that developing country exposure
has a negative impact on bank share values.'7 Bank share values are not only
determined by expected cash repayments, but in part by the deposit insurance.

Of course, U.S. banks differ widely in their developing country exposure and
capitalization rates, and thus these banks face very different probabilities

of ever drawing any funds from the deposit insurance agency. In particular,
heavily exposed banks have a more valuable contingent claim on the deposit

insurance agency. This suggests that bank share values do not decline
linearly with exposure for a given asset base because the value of banks'
contingent claim on the deposit insurance agency to some extent softens the
negative impact of exposure on bank values.

To investigate whether the relationship between bank stock prices and
exposure is in fact non—linear, we estimate the following equation:

Equation (3) is an accounting identity that restricts the market values of

The null hypothesis tested with equation (3) is a, — 0.

Rejection of

this in favor of a positive a supports the deposit insurance hypothesis.
The sample consists of 23 banks for the year 1987. The Lt variable captures
the exposure of banks to four large Latin debtor countries: Argentina,
Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela.'9 The regression results are reported in

Table 2. The negative estimate of a indicates that developing country
exposure leads to discounts in the stock market valuation of bank assets. The
quadratic term is found positive and statistically significant.

The parameter values for equation (3) are used to calculate how bank
value declines for a one dollar increase of developing country exposure (the

marginal discount). The evidence shows that heavily exposed banks value
developing country debt more highly at the margin than the less exposed banks

as indicated by less negative marginal discounts in Table 2. The disparity of
marginal discounts is consistent with the evidence that especially the smaller

See Sachs and Huzinga (1987) for similar estimations. The
restrictions incorporated in equation (3) are supported by our data. For
instance, the estimate of the market value of non—developing country assets is
.995 and it is statistically significant at high levels of confidence, if left
to be determined by an equation similar to (3). Estimation of (3) without the
quadratic term yields an estimate of a of —0.641 with a t—statistic of
—10.87.

Stock price data are for November 31, 1987. All other data are for
the end of 1987. The limitation to four countries is because banks are
required to disclose developing country exposure to individual countries only
if in excess of 1 percent of assets.

16

regional banks used the secondary market to reduce their developing country
exposure during the period considered.
Implicit Insurance

An alternative explanation may stem from the behavior of multilateral

lending agencies and creditor country governments. One of the aims of these
institutions is to safeguard the stability of the creditor country banking

systems. Thus they are more likely to provide lending to debtors to which
banks are more heavily exposed if those countries experience payments

problems. In this manner these third parties will be enhancing the repayment
prospects of those large debtors, providing implicit insurance to the banks.
This could explain the negative relation between exposure and discounts.
While we cannot rule out that implicit insurance of this kind may be at
work, our evidence from the stock market supports the view that deposit

insurance is primarily operating. The varying marginal debt values across
banks cannot be explained by any differences in treatment of debtor countries
by implicit insurance, because banks of different sizes tend to hold
developing country loan portfolios of more or less equal country
c ompo s it ion 20

Additional evidence, somewhat cursory in nature, also provides support

for the deposit insurance explanation. Average discounts increased from 44.8
to 64.7 between the first quarter of 1986 and the final quarter of 1988, while
a large number of the borrowers have been making net transfers to their bank

creditors. One potential explanation for this pattern is that net repayments

20 Exposure to Latin America scaled by exposure to all developing
countries is approximately the same when the largest banks are compared to the
smaller banks: the ratio is .60, .63, .61 for the top 9, next 15, and the
remaining nearly 150 banks respectively at the end of 1987.

make loans. Large banks

may simply have chosen to lend selectively only to higher quality borrowers.
This argument suggests that the exposure variable may just be a proxy for some
further unknown omitted variable that measures the creditworthiness of the

borrower. We have, however, controlled for several repayment indicators. In
particular, we have employed various measures of indebtedness, scaled by

countries exports or CNP. Throughout, the impact of the exposure variable
remains significant.

A variant of the above argument might be that the large banks may have
chosen to sell a smaller share of their high quality loans to syndicate banks.
Accordingly, one may suspect that our exposure variable is an empirical proxy

for such a concentration variable. Sut other evidence indicates that exposure
and concentration do indeed have independent influences on the secondury

market, as demonstrated in Fernandez and Ozier (1991). The partial
correlation between the measure of concentration and our exposure variable is

negligible and not statistically significant. Furthermore, the econometric
investigation of secondary market discounts, in Fernandez and Ozjer,
indicates that exposure continues to play an important role in explaining
discounts even after controlling for the potential impact of concentration.

also suggests that bank capital has a strong positive impact on

lender countries provides an explanation for these results. Evidence on stock
market valuation of bank exposure is offered in support of this view.
The results of this paper contribute to policy evaluations in several

ways and suggest important areas for future work: First, these results
undermine the standard argument for using secondary market prices as

guidelines for possible debt relief to developing countries. It is clearly
arbitrary to permit debt forgiveness on a basis dependent on characteristics
of creditor country financial institutions. A second issue concerns debt

buybacks. In several recent papers Bulow and Rogoff (l988a,b) have argued
that debt buybacks are harmful to the debtor country because the country ends

up paying the average market price to retire marginal debt. The presence of
deposit insurance strengthens the argument that the country (in particular a
large exposure country) pays too much, since the market price now ref'Lects the

average payment per dollar of debt from the country, as well as an implicit

subsidy from the deposit insurance agency.22 Third, our findings support the

insurance is less important in secondary market pricing recently.
22 The Bulow and RagoUt (1988 a,b) result that the market price rises
after a buyback can no longer be considered to be necessarily correct. After

view that deposit insurance biases banks against providing debt forgiveness
(Krugman (1990)). The potent isi gains of debt forgiveness to creditors may be

undervalued by banks with

insured deposits, because forgiveness may lower the

expected subsidy provided by deposit insurance. Finally, this research
suggests that other factors concerning the regulatory and tax environment in
the lender countries or factors that concern the creditors themselves may be
potentially important determinants in the secondary market pricing of
developing country loans.
