The Lessons from the Banking Panics in the United States in the 1930s for the Financial Crisis
of 2007-2008

NBER Working Paper No. 16365

JEL No. E52,N12
ABSTRACT
In this paper we revisit the debate over the role of the banking panics in 1930-33 in precipitating the
Great Contraction. The issue hinges over whether the panics were illiquidity shocks and hence in
support of Friedman and Schwartz (1963) greatly exacerbated the recession which had begun in 1929,
or whether they largely reflected insolvency in response to the recession caused by other forces. Based
on a VAR and new data on the sources of bank failures in the 1930s from Richardson (2007), we find
that illiquidity shocks played a key role in explaining the bank failures during the Friedman and Schwartz
banking panic windows.
In the recent crisis the Federal Reserve learned the Friedman and Schwartz lesson from the banking
panics of the 1930s of conducting expansionary open market policy to meet demands for liquidity.
Unlike the 1930s the deepest problem of the recent crisis was not illiquidity but insolvency and especially
the fear of insolvency of counterparties.

1. Introduction: The Friedman and Schwartz Hypothesis and the Subsequent
Debate
The Great Depression was by far the greatest economic event of the twentieth century
and comparisons to it were rife during the recent Great Recession. Friedman and
Schwartz (1963) labeled the downturn in the United States from August 1929 to March
1933 the Great Contraction. Since that event a voluminous literature has debated its
causes in the United States and its transmission around the world. This paper focuses
strictly on U.S. domestic issues.

At the time, the consensus view was that the slump was a consequence of the speculative
boom of the 1920s. The boom was regarded as a manifestation of deep seated structural
imbalances seen in overinvestment. Indeed according to the Austrian view which
prevailed in the interwar period, depressions were part of the normal operation of the
business cycle. Policy prescriptions from this view included tight money, tight fiscal
policy and wage cuts to restore balance.

Keynes (1936) of course rejected these prescriptions and the Classical view that
eventually a return to full employment would be achieved by falling wages and prices.
He attributed the slump to a collapse of aggregate demand, especially private investment.
His policy prescription was to use fiscal policy—both pump priming and massive
government expenditures. In the post World War II era, Keynesian views dominated the
economics profession and the explanations given for the depression emphasized different
components of expenditure.

3

Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz in A Monetary History of the United States (1963)
challenged this view and attributed the Great Contraction from 1929 to 1933 to a collapse
of the money supply by one third brought about by a failure of Federal Reserve policy.
The story they tell begins with the Fed tightening policy in early 1928 to stem the Wall
Street boom. Fed officials believing in the real bills doctrine were concerned that the
asset price boom would lead to inflation. The subsequent downturn beginning in August
1929 was soon followed by the stock market crash in October. Friedman and Schwartz,
unlike Galbraith (1955), did not view the Crash as the cause of the subsequent depression.
They saw it as an exacerbating factor (whereby adverse expectations led the public to
attempt to increase their liquidity) in the decline in activity in the first year of the
Contraction.

The real problem arose with a series of four banking panics beginning in October 1930
and ending with Roosevelt’s national banking holiday in March 1933. According to
Friedman and Schwartz, the banking panics worked through the money multiplier to
reduce the money stock (via a decrease in the public’s deposit to currency ratio). The
panic in turn reflected what Friedman and Schwartz called a ‘ contagion of fear” as the
public fearful of being last in line to convert their deposits into currency, staged runs on
the banking system, leading to massive bank failures. In today’s terms it would be a
“liquidity shock”. The collapse in money supply in turn led to a decline in spending and,
in the face of nominal rigidities, especially of sticky money wages, a decline in
employment and output. The process was aggravated by banks dumping their earning

4

assets in a fire sale and by debt deflation. Both forces reduced the value of banks
collateral and weakened their balance sheets, in turn leading to weakening and insolvency
of banks with initially sound assets.

According to Friedman and Schwartz, had the Fed acted as a proper lender of last resort
as it was established to be in the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 that it would have offset
the effects of the banking panics on the money stock and prevented the Great Contraction.

Friedman and Schwartz’s “money hypothesis “was attacked by Peter Temin in Did
Monetary Forces Cause the Great Depression? (1976). Temin challenged Friedman and
Schwartz’s assumption that the money supply collapse was an exogenous event. He
argued that money supply fell in response to the downturn. He attributed the collapse in
income to a decline in autonomous consumption expenditure and in exports. The fall in
income in turn reduced the demand for money and money supply responded. At the heart
of his critique is the view that the banking collapses beginning in October of 1930 were
not “contagious liquidity shocks” but endogenous “insolvency” responses to a previous
decline in economic activity especially in agricultural regions hit by declining commodity
prices beginning in the 1920s. This was reflected in a weakening of bank balance sheets.

The Temin challenge prompted an enormous literature in the 1970s and 1980s. The
upshot of the debate was “that though monetary forces are viewed as the key causes of
the Great Depression, non monetary forces emerge as having considerable importance”
Bordo ( 1986 page 358).

5

The issue was revisited in the 1980s in a seminal article by Bernanke (1983) who like
Friedman and Schwartz, attributed the Great Contraction to monetary forces and
especially the collapse of the banking system. However he placed less emphasis on the
effects via the quantity theory of money on spending and more on the consequences of
the collapse of the banking system in raising the cost of financial intermediation.

The issue of the banking panics was revisited in the 1990s in a book by Elmus Wicker
The Banking Panics of the Great Depression (1996) who carefully re examined the
evidence using disaggregated

data from local newspapers and Federal Reserve

documents not available to Friedman and Schwartz. He concluded that two of the
Friedman and Schwartz banking panics, the fall of 1930 and the spring of 1931 were
regional and not national events as Friedman and Schwartz had claimed. The other two
panics, fall 1931 and winter 1933, he concurred were national events. Also, in contrast to
Temin, he supported the Friedman and Schwartz view that all the panics (both regional
and national) were largely liquidity shocks, evidenced in a rise in currency hoarding. He
also argued that expansionary Fed open market policy could have offset the panics and
prevented the transition in 1930-31 from a serious recession to the Great Contraction.

In the past two decades a number of scholars have reopened the issue of the importance
of the banking panics for the U.S. Great Depression and especially whether they reflected
illiquidity or insolvency. Following Temin, Wicker and White (1984), this literature has
focused on disaggregated individual bank data categorized by types of banks and by data

6

sources, in contrast to the macro approach taken by Friedman and Schwartz and
Bernanke. Section 2 discusses some of this literature. Section 3 briefly examines why the
U. S. had so many bank failures and was so prone to banking panics in its history. Section
4 provides some econometric evidence on the issue of illiquidity versus insolvency and
also discusses some of the methodological issues in using macro time series versus using
disaggregated data. Section 5 compares the financial crises of the 1930s in the U.S. to the
recent financial crisis 2007-2008. Section 6 concludes with some lessons for policy.

2. The Recent Debate over U.S. Banking Panics in the 1930s: Illiquidity
versus Insolvency.
In this section we survey recent literature on whether the clusters of bank failures that
occurred between 1930 and 1933 were really panics in the sense of illiquidity shocks.1
This has important implications for the causes of the Great Depression. If the clusters of
bank failures were really panics then it would support the original Friedman and
Schwartz explanation. If the clusters of bank failures primarily reflected insolvency then
other factors such as a decline in autonomous expenditures or negative productivity
shocks (Prescott1999) must explain the Great Contraction.

Friedman and Schwartz viewed the banking panics as largely the consequence of
illiquidity, especially in 1930-31. Their key evidence was a decline in the deposit
currency ratio which lowered the money multiplier, money supply and nominal spending.
They describe the panic in the fall of 1930 as leading to “a contagion of fear’ especially
1

Panics can arise because of exogenous illiquidity shocks in the context of the Diamond and Dybvig
( 1983) random withdrawals model or in the context of asymmetric information induced runs and panics
( Calomiris and Gorton, 1991)

7

after the failure of the Bank of United States in New York City in December. They also
discussed the effects of the initial banking panic leading to contagion by banks dumping
their earning assets in a “fire sale” in order to build up their reserves. This in turn led to
the failure of otherwise solvent banks. Wicker (1996) disputes whether the 1930 panic
and the spring 1931 Friedman and Schwartz panics were national in scope but agrees
with them that all four banking panics were liquidity shocks.

By contrast both Temin(1976) and White (1984), the latter using disaggregated data on a
sample of national banks, argued that the original 1930 banking panic was not a liquidity
event but a solvency event occurring in banks in agricultural regions in the south and the
Midwest which had been weakened by the recession. These small unit banks came out of
the 1920s in a fragile state reflecting declining agricultural prices and oversupply after
World War I. As in Wicker (1980) they identify the locus of the crisis as the collapse on
November 7 1930 of the Caldwell investment bank holding company of Nashville,
Tennessee on November 7, 1930, a chain bank (in which one holding company had a
controlling interest in a chain of banks), and its correspondent network across a half
dozen states.

Calomiris and Mason (2003), following the approach taken in Calomiris and Mason
(1997) to analyze a local banking panic in Chicago in June 1932, use disaggregated data
on all of the individual member banks of the Federal Reserve System to directly address
the question whether the clusters of banking failures of 1930-33 reflected illiquidity or
insolvency. Based on a survival duration model on 8700 individual banks they relate the

8

timing of bank failures to various characteristics of the banks as well as to local, regional
and national shocks. They find that a list of fundamentals including; bank size, the
presence of branch banking, net worth relative to assets as a measure of leverage; reliance
on demand debt; market power; the value of the portfolio; loan quality; the share of
agriculture; as well as several macro variables, largely explains the timing of the bank
failures. When they add into the regression as regressors the Friedman and Schwartz
panic windows (or Wicker’s amendments to them) they turn out to be of minimal
significance. Thus they conclude that ,with the exception of the 1933 banking panic,
which as Wicker (1996) argued reflected a cumulative series of state bank suspensions in
January and February leading to the national banking holiday on March 6, that illiquidity
was inconsequential.

Richardson (2007) provides a new comprehensive data source on the reasons for bank
suspensions from the archives of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors including all
Fed member banks and nonmember banks (both state and local) from August 1929 to just
before the bank holiday in March 1933. He also distinguished between temporary and
permanent suspensions. Based on a questionnaire asked by bank examiners after each
bank suspension, Richardson put together a complete list of the causes of each suspension.
The categories include: depositor runs, declining asset prices, the failure of
correspondents, mergers, mismanagement and defalcations. Richardson then classified
each bank suspension into categories reflecting illiquidity, insolvency or both. With this
data he then constructed indices of illiquidity and insolvency. His data shows that 60% of
the suspensions during the period reflected insolvency, 40% illiquidity. Moreover he

9

shows that the ratio of illiquidity to insolvency spikes during the Friedman and Schwartz
(and also Wicker) panic windows (see Figure 2.1). This evidence in some respects
complements the Friedman and Schwartz, Wicker stories and those of Temin and White.
During the panics illiquidity rises relative to insolvency; between the panics insolvency
increases relative to illiquidity. Consistent with the Friedman and Schwartz stories, the
panics were driven by illiquidity shocks seen in increased hoarding, but after the panics,
in the face of deteriorating economic conditions, bank insolvencies continued to rise. This
is consistent with the evidence of Temin and White. The failures continued through the
contraction until the banking holiday of the week of March 6, 1933 (with the exception of
the spring of 1932 while the Fed was temporarily engaged in open market purchases).

Richardson (2006) backs up the illiquidity story with detailed evidence on the 1930
banking panic. As in Wicker (1980) the failure of Caldwell and Co. in November was the
signature event of this crisis. Richardson uses his new data base to identify the cascade of
failures through the correspondent bank networks based on the Caldwell banks. During
this period most small rural banks maintained deposits on reserve with larger city banks
that in turn would clear their checks through big city clearinghouses and/or the Federal
Reserve System. When Caldwell collapsed so did the correspondent network. Moreover
Richardson and Troost (2009) clearly show that when the tidal wave from Caldwell hit
the banks of the state of Mississippi in December that the banks in the southern half of
the state under the jurisdiction of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta fared much better
(had a lower failure rate) than those in the northern half under the jurisdiction of the

Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The Atlanta Fed followed Bagehot’s Rule discounting
freely the securities of illiquid but solvent member banks. The St. Louis Fed followed the
real bills doctrine and was reluctant to open the discount window to its member banks in
trouble. This pattern holds up when the authors control for fundamentals using a
framework like that in Calomiris and Mason (2003).2

Finally, Christiano et al (2004) build a DSGE model of the Great Contraction
incorporating monetary and financial shocks. They find that the key propagation channels
explaining the slump were the decline in the deposit currency ratio, amplified by
Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist’s (1996) financial accelerator. The liquidity shock
reduced funding for firms, lowering investment and firm’s net worth. At the same time
the increased currency hoarding reduced consumption expenditure. Their simulations,
like those of McCallum (1990) and Bordo, Choudhri and Schwartz (1995) show that
expansionary open market purchases could have offset these shocks.

In sum, the debate over illiquidity versus insolvency in the failures of U.S. banks hinges
on the use of aggregate versus disaggregated data. Aggregate data tends to favor
illiquidity and the presence of and importance of banking panics in creating the Great
Contraction. Disaggregate data tends to focus on insolvency driven by the recession and
to downplay the role of the panics in creating the Great Contraction. However the recent
more comprehensive data unearthed by Richardson as well as the Christiano et al model
suggests that the original Friedman and Schwartz story may well prevail.

Carlson ( 2008) shows that during the panic banks that would otherwise have merged with stronger banks
rather than fail were prevented from doing so.

3. Why Did the U.S. have so many banking panics?
We have argued that the signature event in the U.S. Great Contraction was the series of
banking panics from 1930-33. But this was nothing new in U.S. financial history. From
the early nineteenth century until 1914, the U.S. had a banking panic every decade. There
is a voluminous literature on U.S. financial stability and the lessons that come from that
literature are that the high incidence of banking instability reflected two forces: unit
banking and the absence of an effective lender of last resort.

3.1 Unit Banking

Fear of the concentration of economic power largely explains why states generally
prohibited branch banking and why since the demise of the Second Bank of the United
States in 1836 until quite recently there was no interstate banking (White 1983). Unit
banks, because their portfolios were geographically constrained were highly subject to
local idiosyncratic shocks. Branching banks, especially those which extended across
regions can better diversify their portfolios and protect themselves against local/regional
shocks.

A comparison between the experience of the U.S. and Canadian banking systems makes
the case (Bordo, Redish and Rockoff 1996). The U.S. until the 1920s has had
predominantly unit banking and until very recently a prohibition on interstate banking.
Canada since the late nineteenth century has had nationwide branch banking. Canada
only adopted a central bank in 1934. The U.S. established the Fed in 1914. Canada had

13

no banking panics since Confederation in 1867, the U.S. had nine. However the Canadian
chartered banks were always highly regulated and operated very much like a cartel under
the guidance of the Canadian Bankers Association and the Department of Finance.

3.2 A Lender of Last Resort

Since the demise of the Second Bank of the United States until the establishment of the
Federal Reserve in 1914, the U.S. has not had anything like a central bank to act as a
lender of last resort as the Bank of England had evolved into during the nineteenth
century (Bordo, 2007). Clearinghouses, established first in New York City in 1857 and
other major cities later, on occasion acted as a lender of last resort by pooling the
resources of the members and issuing clearinghouse loan certificates as a substitute for
scarce high powered money reserves. However on several prominent occasions before
1914 the clearinghouses did not allay panics (Timberlake, 1992). Panics were often ended
in the National Banking era by the suspension of convertibility of deposits into currency.
Also the U.S. Treasury on a few occasions performed lender of last resort functions.

The Federal Reserve was established to serve (amongst other functions) as a lender of last
resort but as documented above, failed in its task between 1930 and 1933. Discount
window lending to member banks was at the prerogative of the individual Federal
Reserve banks and as discussed above, some Reserve banks did not follow through.
Moreover until the establishment of the National Credit Corporation in 1931 (which
became the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in 1932) there was no monetary

14

authority to provide assistance to non member banks (Wicker, 1996). Wicker effectively
argues that the panics pre 1914 always were centered in the New York money market and
then spread via the vagaries of the National banking system to the regions. The New
York Fed, according to him, learned the lesson of the panics of the national banking
system and did prevent panics from breaking out in New York City during the Great
Contraction. But as he argues, it did not develop the tools to deal with the regional
banking panics which erupted in 1930 and 1931.

3.3 Recent Evidence

There is considerable empirical evidence going back to the nineteenth century on the case
linking unit banking to failures and panics (White, 1983). Cross country regression
evidence in Grossman (1994) and Grossman (2010) finds that during the 1930s countries
which had unit banking had a greater incidence of banking instability than those which
did not. For the U.S., Wheelock (1995) finds, based on state and county level data that
states that allowed branching had lower bank failure rates than those which did not.
However Carlson (2004) (also Calomiris and Mason, 2003) find based on a panel of
individual banks that state branch banks in the U.S. were less likely to survive the
banking panics. The reason Carlson gives is that while state branch banks can diversify
against idiosyncratic local shocks better than can unit banks they were still exposed to the
systemic shocks of the 1930s. He argues that branch banks used the diversification
opportunities of branching to increase their returns but also followed more risky
strategies such as holding lower reserves.

15

Carlson and Michener (2009) show, based on data on Californian banks in the 1930s
(California was a state that allowed branch banking) that the entry of large branching
networks, by improving the competitive environment actually improved the survival
probabilities of unit banks. They explain the divergent results between studies based on
individual banks and those based on state and county level data by the argument that the
U.S. banking system would have been less fragile in the 1930s had states allowed more
branching not because branch banks would have been more diversified but because the
system would have had more efficient banks.

4. Econometric Evidence
In this section an orthogonalized vector autoregression (VAR) is estimated using
aggregate data on bank failures/suspensions, unemployment, money supply and a quality
spread which is the difference between the yield on a Baa rated bond and a composite
yield on 10 year maturity Treasury bills. The data we use on bank failures/suspensions
includes a series on total bank failures/suspensions found in Table 12 of the 1937 Federal
Reserve Bulletin and two new series on bank failures/suspensions due to illiquidity and
insolvency from Richardson (2007).

The aim of this exercise is to identify illiquidity shocks from insolvency shocks in an
attempt to answer the question of the underlying fundamental causes of the financial
crises identified by Friedman and Schwartz (1963). The use of aggregate data is useful
for this aim in that we are able to identify common trends (or factors) affecting the

16

aggregate economy. This approach is in contrast to the literature on explaining bank
failures during the Great Depression that uses disaggregated micro data on banks at the
local, state, and regional level. This literature is successful at explaining why different
locations were affected in different ways during the financial crises but is silent on the
underlying common factors (if any) that were driving the crises.

Probably the best known paper from this literature, Calomiris and Mason (2003), utilize a
panel data set of Federal Reserve banks and estimate a bank survival duration model for
the period of great bank stress during the early 1930’s. This excellent paper claims,
among other things, that the bank failures during this period were local and regional in
nature and that their covariates, such as individual measures of bank stress, do a good job
of explaining why banks failed during the first three financial crises identified by
Friedman and Schwartz (1963). They show this by adding in crisis dummies for the three
periods (Oct-1930 to Jan-1931, March-1931 to Aug-1931, and Sept-1931 to Dec-1931)
into their log-logistic survival model and show that these event dummies add little to the
predicted bank failures generated by their model. Because the log-logistic survival model
has a time varying underlying hazard function what this study shows is that the event
dummy does not explain more than the baseline hazard function underlying their
econometric model.

Using this methodology with disaggregated data is therefore silent on whether the local
and regional bank failures that were observed were driven by underlying common factors

17

that were national in scope.3 What this study does show however is that the regional/local
differences in bank failures that are orthogonal to the underlying baseline hazard can be
explained by bank fundamentals. What we do not know is whether the underlying
baseline hazard was also driven by bank fundamentals or by common aggregate (or
national) factors. In general, we know of no disaggregated study that does allow for a
factor structure in the covariates of the model so that the nature of the common factors
affecting bank failures in the 1930s, if any, is still an open question.

This paper aims to contribute to this debate using the new series on bank failures
constructed by Richardson (2007). In this study, as mentioned above, Richardson uses
reports from the Federal Reserve Board to assign bank failures to one of two categories:
failure or suspension due to insolvency and failure or suspension (of otherwise solvent
banks) due to illiquidity. Our hope is that we can identify, using an orthogonalized VAR,
the underlying fundamental aggregate illiquidity and insolvency shocks and determine
whether they have any explanatory power in explaining bank failures. We see this study
as complimentary to the disaggregated studies noted above.

Figure 4.1 depicts the data we have on total number of bank failures and suspensions
(hereafter referred to as BFS, from Table 12 of the 1937 Federal Reserve Bulletin) and
the two series sourced from Richardson (2007). The shaded regions in the figure show
the Friedman and Schwartz

3

In their regression Calomiris and Mason (2003) do include national variables but find that they are not
significant. However, this means that the national variables do not explain the differences in bank
suspensions orthogonal to their baseline hazard which most likely contains the national factors impacting
ON bank suspensions.

(1963) financial crises windows. It is apparent from the figure that the illiquidity and
insolvency series behave quite differently especially during the first crisis of 1931.
Through the use of an orthogonalized VAR we aim to extract from these series a set of
orthogonal illiquidity shocks and insolvency shocks with the hope of determining their
relevance to explaining the underlying behavior of the total bank failure series.

The data that we use from Richardson (2007) are his broad measures of bank
failures/suspensions due to illiquidity and insolvency. Richardson (2007, p. 602—603)

19

describes in detail exactly which suspensions are determined to be due to illiquidity and
which are due to insolvency. Banks included in the illiquidity series include those that
were suspended temporarily, those that closed permanently because of heavy withdrawals
and those that closed because of the failure of correspondent banks. Also included in the
broad definition are banks that were suspended because their assets were considered to be
slow or they failed to get loans from correspondent banks or they ran out of reserves. The
broad definition of banks that were deemed to have failed or suspended because of
insolvency included banks with slow, worthless, or frozen assets, depreciation of assets
(real estate, stocks and bonds), inability to collect loans, and local depression.

These two series do not sum up to total bank failures/suspensions. Reasons for this
include double counting (some banks were counted multiple times if they were suspended
temporarily, reopened and then subsequently closed) and the exclusion or two additional
categories explaining bank failure/suspension. These two categories include poor
management and defalcations (fraud or other reasons).

4.2 VAR Analysis

The six variables that we include in our model are the three time series on bank
failures/suspensions, the quality spread (as a measure of Bernanke (1983)’s credit
disintermediation channel), the change in the unemployment rate and the growth rate of
money supply. In order to identify underlying structural shocks to the system we utilize a
triangular ordering so that variables ordered earlier contemporaneously affect variables

20

ordered later while variables ordered later do not contemporaneously affect variables
ordered before them. Thus the contemporaneous impact matrix for the endogenous
variables is lower-triangular with 1’s on its diagonal. We also assume that the structural
shocks are orthogonal to each other but have potentially different variances.

The data are ordered in two blocks: The first block includes the bank failures/suspensions
time series and the second include the money, unemployment, and quality spread
variables. Thus bank failures will contemporaneously affect money supply,
unemployment and the quality spread.

The three bank failure variables in the system are bank failures/suspensions due to
illiquidity,

banks

failures/suspensions

due

to

insolvency

and

total

bank

failures/suspensions. The most important assumption is the ordering of the bank
failures/suspensions due to illiquidity series before the bank failures/suspensions due to
insolvency series in the VAR. In Richardson (2007) banks that fail or are suspended due
to a reason of illiquidity are counted in the number of fails/suspensions due to liquidity
and banks that fail or are suspended due to insolvency are assigned to the number of
fails/suspensions due to insolvency. It is possible to imagine a situation where a bank run
(an illiquidity shock) may cause banks that are otherwise solvent to fail due to illiquidity.
Insolvent banks may also be caught up in the bank run and therefore it is natural to think
that

bank

to

will

failures/suspensions due to insolvency.4

These technically insolvent banks may still be operating due to asymmetric information between
depositors and bank operators.

21

The failure of insolvent banks would not immediately affect illiquid but otherwise solvent
banks, at least in the short run. However, the solvency shock may also cause, through
contagion, a run on otherwise healthy banks, especially if there was a run up of closures
of insolvent banks preceding the bank run. Our identifying assumption is that if the
insolvency shock causes a bank run then this will happen with a time lag. That is, the
identifying assumption is that the illiquidity shock might cause some insolvent banks to
fail contemporaneously whereas the insolvency shock will lead to failures due to
illiquidity only with a lag. The final variable is total bank failures and is not exactly equal
to the sum of the previous two bank failure series. This is because not all bank failures
are attributed to illiquidity or insolvency as noted in the previous paragraph.

The ordering we choose for the last three variables is the following: the first variable is
the growth rate of the money supply, the second is the change in the unemployment rate
and the third is the quality spread. The triangular ordering we use implies then that each
variable contemporaneously effects each variable ordered below it but not any variable
ordered above it in the vector. Thus a change in the growth rate of money supply
contemporaneously affects the change in unemployment and the quality spread while the
change in the unemployment rate contemporaneously affects the quality spread. These
variables then affect bank failures/suspensions with a lag.

Thus we identify six shocks in total that we interpret as follows: the first shock, is the
illiquidity shock, the second is the insolvency shock while the third is a bank

22

failure/suspension residual shock. It is the shock to banks failures/suspensions that cannot
be attributed to either illiquidity or insolvency. The next three shocks are a money growth
rate shock, an aggregate real shock to unemployment that is orthogonal to the money
growth shock, and a shock to the quality spread that is orthogonal to all the previous
shocks. We might consider this shock to be a credit shock. Note we cannot with this
specification identify supply or demand shocks for both the money shocks and aggregate
real shocks.

The reduced form VAR is estimated using ordinary least squares with two lags of each
variable in each equation. Before estimation each variable was tested for non-stationarity.
The detailed results are reported in the appendix. It was determined that the money
supply and unemployment series were non-stationary so that all variables enter the VAR
in log-levels except for money supply and the unemployment rate who enter as first
differences of the log-level.

The sample period used (based on Richardson’s data)

finished in February, 1933 and so does not include the period of the bank holiday starting
on March 6, 1933.

The lag structure was determined using various information criteria and the standard
sequential likelihood ratio tests. All information criteria and the sequential likelihood
ratio test suggest two lags should be included. The results from this estimation are
reported in Table A.2 of the appendix. These estimates are reported in Table A.3 in the
appendix. The results from Table A.3 suggest that there are a large number of significant
contemporaneous relationships between the variables. All coefficients are significant

23

except for the effect of the illiquidity and insolvency shocks on the growth rate of money
supply. In order to determine the effect of our identified shocks on the variables in our
system we now turn to the orthogonalized impulse response functions. All of the impulse
response functions are reported in the appendix.

A full discussion of all the impulse response functions can be found in the appendix. In
what follows we summarize our findings and highlight the important conclusions. Figure
4.2 shows the impulse response functions for total bank failures/suspensions and Table
4.1 reports the forecast error variance decomposition. It is clear that the illiquidity shock
has a large and persistent effect on total bank failures/suspensions. The forecast error
variance decompositions show that the illiquidity shock accounts for roughly 50% of the
forecast error with the insolvency shock only accounting for 16%. Thus it appears that
the illiquidity shock is very important for explaining total bank failures/suspensions.

One additional point to make with regard to total bank failures/suspensions is that the
money shock also has some effect. A positive shock to money growth has the effect of
lowering bank failures/suspensions. This result is persistent and occurs for each of the
bank failure/suspension series. The effect of money is especially strong and persistent for
the bank failures/suspensions due to insolvency series. This result suggests that monetary
policy aim at increasing the growth rate of money may have helped to mitigate some of
the bank failures/suspensions that occurred during the early 1930’s. This result reinforces
the views of Christiano et al (2004), McCallum (1990) and Bordo, Choudhri and
Schwartz (1995).

The effect of the real aggregate shock on total bank failures/suspension series is
somewhat significant at about the sixth lag and this result is somewhat stronger for the
bank failure/suspension due to illiquidity and insolvency series.

Our identification assumptions were that the bank failures/suspensions led to immediate
shocks on money, unemployment and the quality spread. The impulse responses for these
three variables do not contradict this identification assumption. In fact we observe that
the illiquidity and insolvency shock do indeed have immediate and significant effects on
unemployment (a positive illiquidity or insolvency shock induces a rise in
unemployment) and we observe that the illiquidity shock has a significant negative and
persistent effect on money growth.

The impulse responses therefore generally produce results that accord with the idea that
the bank failures/suspensions fed directly into unemployment and money supply and
these in turn fed back into the bank failure/suspension series. In fact we see that the

26

illiquidity shock has a significant and negative shock on money and money in turn has a
significant, large and persistent effect on bank failures/suspensions due to insolvency.
Thus the illiquidity shock has a strong direct and indirect effect on bank failures due to
insolvency.

The impulse response functions together with the variance decompositions show that the
illiquidity shock is very important in explaining the bank failures/suspensions during the
early 1930’s. In order to determine if the illiquidity shocks played a role during the
particular financial crisis windows identified by Friedman and Schwartz (1963) we now
turn to historical decompositions. Figure 4.3 contains historical decompositions for the
total bank failures/suspensions series. Each panel of Figure 4.3 contains a simulated total
bank failures/suspensions series under the hypothesis that only one orthogonalized shock
was driving the stochastic component of the data. Thus the paned titled illiquidity shock
shows the generated series if there was only an illiquidity shock.

The results of the historical decompositions clearly point to the illiquidity shock playing a
significant role in the bank failures during the Friedman and Schwartz crisis windows.
The most obvious case is during the first window from October, 1930 to January, 1931.
Here the historical decomposition for the illiquidity series almost completely follows the
actual data. The other shocks do not explain this first crisis window at all. For the next
two crisis windows that take up most of 1931 the illiquidity shock does generate series
that follow the actual series quite well. During these periods the money shock and the

insolvency shock generate series that do peak around the right time but they do not
generate series that closely follow the actual total bank failures/suspensions series. The

28

only crisis window that the insolvency shock does predict well appears to the final crisis
of early 1933. In this case it does appear that the financial crisis in 1933 is more an
insolvency story then an illiquidity story.

To summarize we have estimate a VAR and used a triangular ordering to identify a set of
shocks including illiquidity and insolvency shocks. The impulse response functions
obtained from this orthogonalized VAR make sense and show that the illiquidity shock is
an important shock for explaining the observed bank failures/suspensions series. Further,
the historical decompositions show that the financial crises of late 1930 and all of 1931
are well modeled as illiquidity crises. The financial crisis of 1933 is better explained as
an insolvency crisis.

Finally, we should caution that the results obtained above are obtained from an
orthogonalized VAR and so do not have a full structural interpretation. For example we
have not included wages or prices and we have not identified money supply and money
demand shocks separately from each other, nor have we identified aggregate demand and
supply shocks separately from each other. We have only identified shocks to money
supply and to unemployment but cannot say whether these are due to demand or supply
shocks.

While we want to be cautious in interpreting our results we have also performed a
number of robustness checks. First, the result that the illiquidity shock is the dominant
shock for explaining the total bank failures/suspensions is robust to how the real and

29

monetary variables are ordered. For example, putting the money growth rate, change in
unemployment, and quality spread block first does not change the results on the relative
importance of the illiquidity shock on total bank failures/suspensions presented above.

A second robustness check was to drop the quality spread from the VAR and only
include money growth and unemployment in the VAR. Again the illiquidity shock is the
dominant shock on total bank failures/suspensions. Third, we also follow the Bernanke
(1983) story and replace the money variable with the quality spread variable. Again we
get qualitatively similar results in that the illiquidity shock is dominant in explaining the
total bank failures/suspensions series. The quality spread appears to be more important
between the third and fourth financial crises (i.e. during 1932) but does not play an
important role during the four financial crises windows.

5. A Comparison of the Financial Crisis in the U.S. to the 2007-2008 Crisis
Many people have invoked the experience during the Great Contraction and especially
the banking crises of 1929-33 as a good comparison to the financial crisis and Great
Recession of 2007-2009. In several descriptive figures in this section we compare the
behavior of some key variables between the two events. We demarcate the crisis
windows in the Great Contraction using Friedman and Schwartz’s dates. For the recent
period we use Gorton’s (2010) characterization of the crisis as starting in the shadow
bank repo market in August 2007 (dark grey shading)and then changing to a panic in the
Universal banks after Lehman failed in September 2007 (light grey shading) . In most

30

respects, e.g. the magnitude of the decline in real GDP and the rise in unemployment (see
Figures 5.1 and 5.2) the two events are very different but there are some parallels in
recent events to the 1930s. In Figure 5.1 we report real GNP for the 1930’s and the
2007—2009 normalized to be 100 at the start of each period. It is quite clear that the
contraction in late 2007 was mild (only about 5% peak to trough) relative to Great
Contraction in the 1930’s (roughly 35% peak to trough). The same is clear for
unemployment which is depicted in Figure 5.2. Unemployment rose from near 0% at the
start of the Great Contraction to slightly over 25% by the end of the contraction whereas
the rise in unemployment from 4% to 10% for the most recent contraction is small in
comparison.

As discussed above the signature of the Great Contraction was a collapse in the money
supply brought about by a collapse in the public’s deposit currency ratio, a decline in the
banks deposit reserve ratio and a drop in the money multiplier (see Figures 5.3-5.6). In
the recent crisis M2 did not collapse, indeed it rose reflecting expansionary monetary
policy. Moreover the deposit currency ratio did not collapse in the recent crisis, it rose.
There were no runs on the commercial banks because depositors knew that their deposits
were protected by federal deposit insurance which was introduced in 1934 in reaction to
the bank runs of the 1930s. The deposit reserve ratio declined reflecting an expansionary
monetary policy induced increase in banks excess reserves rather than a scramble for
liquidity as in the 1930s. The money multiplier declined in the recent crisis largely
explained by a massive expansion in the monetary base reflecting the Fed’s doubling of

its balance sheet in 2008 (see Figure 5.7). Moreover although a few banks failed recently,
they were miniscule relative to the 1930s (Figure 5.8) as were deposits in failed banks
relative to total deposits (see Figure 5.9).5

Thus the recent financial crisis and recession was not a pure Friedman and Schwartz
money story. It was not driven by an old fashioned contagious banking panic. But like
1930-33 there was a financial crisis. It reflected a run in August 2007 on the Shadow
Banking system which was not regulated by the central bank nor covered by the financial
safety net. According to Eichengreen (2008) its rapid growth was a consequence of the
repeal in 1999 of the Depression era Glass Steagall Act of 1935 which had separated
commercial from investment banking. These institutions held much lower capital ratios
than the traditional commercial banks and hence were considerably more prone to risk.
When the crisis hit they were forced to engage in major deleveraging involving a fire sale
of assets into a falling market which in turn lowered the value of their assets and those of
other financial institutions. A similar negative feedback loop occurred during the Great
Contraction according to Friedman and Schwartz.

According to Gorton (2010) the crisis centered in the repo market (sale and repurchase
agreements) which had been collateralized by opaque (subprime) mortgage backed
securities by which investment banks and some universal banks had been funded. The
5

The large spike in 1933 in both figures 5.7 and 5.8 largely represents the Bank holiday of March 6-10 in
which the entire nation’s banks were closed and an army of examiners determined whether they were
solvent or not. At the end of the week one sixth of the nation’s banks were closed. The relatively large
spike in 2008 in the deposits in failed bank series reflected the failure and reorganization by the FDIC of
Countrywide bank. Compared to the case in the 1930s failures there were no insured depositor losses.

crisis after the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. The crisis led to a credit
crunch which led to a serious, but compared to the Great Contraction, not that serious
recession (see figures 5.1 and 5.2). The recession was attenuated in 2009 by expansionary
monetary and fiscal policy.

Figure 5.10 compares the Baa- Ten year Composite Treasury spread between the two
historical episodes. This spread is often used as a measure of credit market turmoil
(Bordo and Haubrich 2010). As can be seen the spike in the spread in 2008 is not very
different from that observed in the early 1930s.

5.1 The Recent Crisis in more detail.

The crisis occurred following two years of rising policy rates. Its causes include: major
changes in regulation, lax regulatory oversight, a relaxation of normal standards of
prudent lending and a period of abnormally low interest rates. The default on a significant
fraction of subprime mortgages produced spillover effects around the world via the
securitized mortgage derivatives into which these mortgages were bundled, to the balance
sheets of investment banks, hedge funds and conduits( which are bank owned but off
their balance sheets) which intermediate between mortgage and other asset backed
commercial paper and long-term securities. The uncertainty about the value of the
securities collateralized by these mortgages spread uncertainty through the financial
system about the soundness of loans for leveraged buyouts. All of this led to the freezing

of the interbank lending market in August 2007 and substantial liquidity injections by the
Fed and other central banks.

The Fed then both extended and expanded its discount window facilities and cut the
federal funds rate by 300 basis points. The crisis worsened in March 2008 with the rescue
of the Investment bank, Bear Stearns, by JP Morgan backstopped by funds from the
Federal Reserve. The rescue was justified on the grounds that Bear Stearns exposure to
counterparties was so extensive that a worse crisis would follow if it were not bailed out.
The March crisis also led to the creation of a number of new discount window facilities
whereby investment banks could access the window and which broadened the collateral
acceptable for discounting. The next major event was a Federal Reserve Treasury bailout
and partial nationalization of the insolvent GSEs, Fannie and Freddie Mac in July 2008
on the grounds that they were crucial to the functioning of the mortgage market.

Events took a turn for the worse in September 2008 when the Treasury and Fed allowed
the investment bank Lehman Brothers to fail to discourage the belief that all insolvent
institutions would be saved in an attempt to prevent moral hazard. It was argued that
Lehman was both in worse shape and less exposed to counterparty risk than Bear Stearns.
The next day the authorities bailed out and nationalized the insurance giant AIG fearing
the systemic consequences for collateralized default swaps (insurance contracts on
securities) if it were allowed to fail. The fallout from the Lehman bankruptcy then turned
the liquidity crisis into a full fledged global credit crunch and stock market crash as
interbank lending effectively seized up on the fear that no banks were safe.

44

In the ensuing atmosphere of panic, along with Fed liquidity assistance to the commercial
paper market and the extension of the safety net to money market mutual funds, the US
Treasury sponsored its Troubled Asset Relief Plan (TARP) whereby $ 700 billion could
be devoted to the purchase of heavily discounted mortgage backed and other securities to
remove them from the banks’ balance sheets and restore bank lending. As it later turned
out most of the funds were used to recapitalize the banks.

In early October the crisis spread to Europe and to the emerging market countries as the
global interbank market ceased functioning. The UK authorities responded by pumping
equity into British banks, guaranteeing all interbank deposits and providing massive
liquidity. The EU countries responded in kind. And on October 13 2008 the US Treasury
followed suit with a plan to inject $250 into the U.S. banks, to provide insurance of
senior interbank debt and unlimited deposit insurance for non interest bearing deposits.
These actions ended the crisis. Expansionary Federal Reserve policy at the end of 2008,
lowering the funds rate close to zero, followed by a policy of quantitative easing: the
open market purchases of long-term Treasuries and mortgage backed securities finally
attenuated the recession by the summer of 2009.

Unlike the liquidity panics of the Great Contraction the deepest problem facing the
financial system was insolvency. This was only recognized by the Fed after the
September 2008 crisis. The problem stemmed from the difficulty of pricing securities
backed by a pool of assets, whether mortgage loans, student loans, commercial paper

45

issues, or credit card receivables. Pricing securities based on a pool of assets is difficult
because the quality of individual components of the pool varies and unless each
component is individually examined and evaluated, no accurate price of the security can
be determined.

As a result, the credit market, confronted by financial firms whose portfolios were filled
with securities of uncertain value, derivatives that were so complex the art of pricing
them had not been mastered, was plagued by the inability to determine which firms were
solvent and which were not. Lenders were unwilling to extend loans when they couldn’t
be sure that a borrower was creditworthy. This was a serious shortcoming of the
securitization process that was responsible for the paralysis of the credit market.

Finally another hallmark of the recent crisis which was not present in the Great
Contraction is that the Fed and other US monetary authorities engaged in a series of
bailouts of incipient and actual insolvent firms deemed too systemically connected to fail.
These included Bear Stearns in March 2008, the GSEs in July and AIG in September.
Lehman Brothers had been allowed to fail in September on the grounds that it was both
insolvent and not as systemically important as the others and as was stated well after the
event that the Fed didn’t have the legal authority to bail it out. The extension of the “Too
Big To Fail” doctrine which had begun in 1984 with the bailout of Continental Illinois
bank may be the source of future crises.

6. Conclusion: Some policy lessons from history.
In this paper we have reexamined the issue of the role of the banking panics between
1930 and 1933 in creating the Great Contraction. We focused on the debate between
those following the Friedman and Schwartz view that the banking crises were illiquidity
shocks and those following the Temin approach who view the clusters of banking
failures as not being liquidity driven panics but insolvencies caused by the recession.
Our survey of the evidence suggests that the banking crises did reflect contagious
illiquidity. But also that endogenous insolvency was important between the panics. Bank
failures regardless of their genesis contributed to the depression by reducing the money
supply and by crippling the credit mechanism.

Our empirical results showed that illiquidity played a major role in the financial crises of
late 1930 and all 1931. We estimated a VAR and used a triangular ordering to identify a
set of shocks including illiquidity and insolvency shocks. The impulse response functions
obtained from this orthogonalized VAR make sense and show that the illiquidity shock is
an important shock for explaining the observed bank failures/suspensions series. Further,
the historical decompositions show that the financial crisis of late 1930 and all of 1931
are well modeled as illiquidity crises. The financial crisis of 1933 is better explained as
an insolvency crisis.

The Federal Reserve learned the Friedman and Schwartz lesson from the banking panics
of the 1930s of the importance of conducting expansionary open market policy to meet

47

all of the demands for liquidity (Bernanke 2002). In the recent crisis the Fed conducted
highly expansionary monetary policy in the fall of 2007 and from late 2008 to the present.
Also , based on Bernanke’s 1983 view that the banking collapse led to a failure of the
credit allocation mechanism, the Fed, in conjunction with the Treasury, developed a
plethora of extensions to its discount window referred to as credit policy (Goodfriend,
2009) to encompass virtually every kind of collateral in an attempt to unclog the blocked
credit markets.

Some argue that for the first three quarters of 2008 that Fed monetary policy was actually
too tight seen in a flattening of money growth and the monetary base and high real
interest rates (Hetzel, 2009). Although the Fed’s balance sheet surged, the effects on high
powered money were sterilized. This may have reflected concern that rising commodity
prices at the time would spark inflationary expectations. By the end of the third quarter of
2008 the sterilization ceased evident in a doubling of the base.

The Fed’s credit policy involved providing credit directly to markets and firms the Fed
deemed most in need of liquidity and exposed the Fed to the temptation to politicize its
selection of the recipients of its credit (Schwartz 2009). In addition the Fed’s balance
sheet ballooned in 2008 and 2009 with the collateral of risky assets including those of
non banks. These assets were in part backed by the Treasury. The Fed also worked
closely with the Treasury in the fall of 2008 to stabilize the major banks with capital
purchases and stress testing. Moreover the purchase of mortgage backed securities in
2009 (quantitative easing) combined monetary with fiscal policy. These actions which

48

many argue helped reduce the spreads and reopen the credit channels impinged upon the
Fed’s independence and created problems for the Fed in the future (Bordo, 2010).

As discussed in section 5, the deepest problem of the recent crisis however was not
illiquidity as it was in the 1930s but insolvency and especially the fear of insolvency of
counterparties. This has echoes in the correspondence banking induced panic of
November 1930 (Richardson, 2006). But very different from the 1930s the too big to fail
doctrine which had developed in the 1980s ensured that the monetary authorities would
bail out insolvent large financial firms which were deemed too interconnected to fail.
This is a dramatic departure from the original Bagehot’s rule prescription to provide
liquidity to illiquid but solvent banks. This new type of systemic risk (Tallman and
Wicker 2010) raises the spectre of moral hazard and future financial crises and future
bailouts.

In conclusion the crisis of 2007-2008 had similarities to the 1930s in that there was a
panic in the shadow banking system and the repo market in 2007 as argued by Gorton
( 2010) but also in investment banks and the universal banking system after Lehman
failed in September 2008. But it was not a classic contagious banking panic. The decision
to bail out large interconnected financial institutions in the fall of 2008 does not have
much resonance in the 1930s experience. The closest parallel from the 1930s was the
Bank of United States which failed in December 1930. It was one of the largest banks in
the country but it was insolvent and it was allowed to fail (Lucia 1985). A key concern

49

from the bailouts of 2008 is that in the future the too big to fail doctrine will lead to
excessive risk taking by such firms and future crises and bailouts.

Appendix
A.1 Unit Root Tests on our main variables

Before constructing and estimating a VAR we first need to investigate the time series
properties of the time series used in the VAR. The results of various unit root tests are
reported in Table A.1. Even though the period we investigate in the VAR is only 51
months long, we test for a unit root in each series using all the data we have on each
series. In some cases this is for most of the Twentieth Century but for others, in particular
the bank fail series, we only have 51 observations. Given that the standard unit-root tests
have poor power in small samples we utilize three different tests to determine the
underlying unit root properties of the individual time series.

We utilize the standard augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root test of Dickey and
Fuller (1979), the Heteroskedastic corrected augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF-GLS) test of
Elliot, Rothenberg, and Stock (1996) (both of these tests have the hypothesis that the time
series has a unit root as its null hypothesis), and the unit root test of Kwiatkowski,
Phillips, Schmidt, and Shin (KPSS, 1992). This last test has as its null hypothesis that the
time series being tested is stationary.

The results for the three bank failure series all suggest that the logarithm of bank failures
do not contain a unit root. Both of the ADF based tests reject the null hypothesis that the

57

individual series contain a unit root. However, the KPSS is also rejected contradicting the
ADF tests. In order to determine if these series have a unit root or not the cointegration
test of Johansen (1991) is used on the three variables. This test finds three cointegrating
relationships which implies that the three series are indeed stationary (or I(0)). Given this
preponderance of evidence we include the log-level of the bank failure series in our VAR
system.

The unit tests on the quality spread variable are quite clear in rejecting the hypothesis that
it contains a unit root, in the case of the ADF tests, and not rejecting the hypothesis that it
is stationary, in the case of the KPSS test, so we conclude that the quality spread is
stationary and so we will include the log-level of the quality spread in our VAR. The
final two aggregate series, the logarithm of the money supply and the logarithm of the
unemployment rate are found to be non-stationary. Thus these variables will enter into
the VAR as first differences. Thus we will be using the growth rate of money supply and
the percentage change of the unemployment rate as our variables reflecting the real and
monetary side of the economy (along with the quality spread).

A.2 Discussion of Impulse Response Functions
The effect of the six shocks on bank failures due to illiquidity can be seen in Figure A.1.
A one standard deviation illiquidity shock appears to quite persistent given that the
impulse response of bank failures/suspensions due to illiquidity does not return to 0 (in a
statistical sense) until 4 months after the shock A insolvency shock has a significant

58

effect on bank failures/suspensions due to illiquidity but the effect is small and peaks
after one month. The same can be said for the residual bank fail shock. We see from the
third panel of Figure A.1 that a positive shock to bank failures/suspensions leads to an
increase in fail due to illiquidity in the future with the peak effect occurring only one
month out.

The effects of the real shocks are also consistent with prior beliefs. An increase in the
growth rate of money leads to a decrease in bank failures/suspensions due to illiquidity
but the effect is not immediate with the significant negative impact occurring 4 months
after the money shock. The effect of a one standard deviation increase in the
unemployment rate (a negative real aggregate shock) also adversely effects bank
failures/suspensions due to illiquidity but there is a long delay of 6 months before there is
a significant increase in bank fails/suspensions due to illiquidity. Finally an increase in
the quality spread (another negative shock to the economy) leads to an increase in bank
fails/suspensions due to illiquidity but the significance of this impact is questionable and
again the impact appears to be short lived.

Figure A.2 reports the impulse responses of bank fails/suspensions due to the six
structural shocks. Similar patterns appear here as well. There are however some
important differences to the impulse to bank fails/suspensions due to illiquidity. First, the
illiquidity shock has just as big an impact as the insolvency shock.

59

The illiquidity shock is quite persistent as well with a positive effect on bank
failures/suspensions due to insolvency lasting 2 months. Another interesting result is the
effect the money growth rate shock has on bank failures/suspensions due to insolvency.
Again we see a positive shock to money growth rates have a negative effect on bank
failures/suspensions due to insolvency. Unlike the bank failures/suspensions due to
illiquidity series this effect happens sooner and is more persistent; lasting at least until 4
months after the shock. Unlike the bank failures/suspensions due to illiquidity series the
unemployment shock and the quality spread shock do not significantly affect bank
failures/suspensions due to insolvency. Figure A.3 shows the effect of the six shocks on
total bank failures/suspensions. The results are similar with the illiquidity shock having a
large and persistent effect on bank failures/suspensions and a positive money shock
having a significant and persistent negative effect on total bank failures.

The effects on the other three variables of the six structural shocks are shown in Figures
A.4 – A.6. The growth rate of money is affected negatively by the illiquidity and residual
bank failure shocks but not by the insolvency shock. The illiquidity shock is quite
persistent while the residual shock is not. An unemployment shock does decrease money
supply but only after 3 months while the quality spread shock also affects money growth
negatively (note that the 95% confidence interval does include 0 on the boundary so we
could say that it was significant at the 10% level at least). The quality spread shock is
also quite persistent.

60

With regards to unemployment, the illiquidity and insolvency shocks have immediate and
positive effects on unemployment but these effects are not persistent. The insolvency
shock appears to lower unemployment after 3 months which is a puzzle but that may be
due to the effect the unemployment (or real aggregate) shock has on itself where we see
overshooting as unemployment declines 3 months after a positive real aggregate shock.
The quality spread shock doe not appear to affect unemployment.

Finally there is the effect of the six shocks on the quality spread. The money shock has a
big effect on the quality spread with a positive shock the growth rate of money causing
the quality spread to decline. The three bank fail series do not appear to significantly
affect quality spread except that the illiquidity shock does appear to have a significant
positive effect of the quality spread only in the period of the shock. The real aggregate
shock has a significant but negative effect on the quality spread. Given that this shock is
an increase in unemployment this negative effect on the quality spread is perverse and
puzzling.

Overall the impulse response functions are consistent with our prior beliefs – except for
the one case of the effect of an unemployment shock on the quality spread. The results
are consistent in that the illiquidity shock has a big and persistent impact on bank
failures/suspensions while the insolvency shock, while significant, is not as persistent.
The other consistent result was that a money shock had a negative impact on bank
failures/suspensions with the biggest effect for the bank failures/suspensions due to
insolvency.

61

Of course the impulse response functions do not give an indication of which shock is
more important due to the fact that each impulse response is for a one standard deviation
shock to the identified structural shocks and that each shock has a different variance. The
estimated variances are reported in Table A.3 and it is clear that the illiquidity shock
variance is large relative to the insolvency shock. In order to better compare the effect of
each shock on the variables in our VAR we turn to the forecast error decomposition
reported in Figure A.7. There we report the proportion of the forecast error for k periods
into the future that can be attributed to each shock. The blue line in the figure is the
contribution of the illiquidity shock, the red line the contribution of the insolvency shock
and the black line the contribution of the money shock.

The first thing to notice is that the illiquidity shock contributes the most for the bank
failures/suspensions due to illiquidity and total bank failures/suspensions series and is
also relatively equal to the contribution of the insolvency shock for the bank
failures/suspensions due to insolvency series. The illiquidity shock also contributes
nearly 20% of the forecast error variance for the money growth rate variable. The
insolvency shock contributes significantly to unemployment but for all other variables it
is not as important as the illiquidity shock. The money shock has an important
contribution to bank failures/suspensions due to insolvency and to the quality spread but
has relatively insignificant effects on the other variables.

62

Figure A.8 depicts the identified structural shocks. The shaded regions are the Friedman
and Schwarz (1963) financial crises windows. For the first crises the illiquidity shock is
prominent with its peak occurring at the start of the crisis window. The residual bank fail
shock is also large early on in the crisis. The peak in the insolvency occurs later in the
crisis suggesting for that crisis the insolvency shock followed after the illiquidity shock.

For the second crisis there is a large insolvency shock at the start of the window but a
very large illiquidity shock about half way through the shock window. The insolvency
shock again picks up at the end of the second crisis window but that may have been
caused by the large negative shock to money supply growth that occurred at the time of
the illiquidity shock.

The third crisis has an appearance of a perfect storm in that there is a large negative
money shock, a large positive unemployment shock, and a large positive shock to the
quality spread immediately preceding the crisis window. There are also large positive
illiquidity and insolvency shocks occurring as well. Finally the final crisis appears to be
an insolvency and money story with a very large negative money shock immediately after
a large insolvency shock in late 1932.
