Sunlight and Protection Against Influenza
David Slusky and Richard J. Zeckhauser
NBER Working Paper No. 24340
February 2018, Revised July 2020
JEL No. I10,I12,I18
ABSTRACT
Recent medical literature suggests that vitamin D supplementation protects against acute
respiratory tract infection. Humans exposed to sunlight produce vitamin D directly. This paper
investigates how differences in sunlight, as measured over several years across states and during
the same calendar week, affect influenza incidence. We find that sunlight strongly protects
against getting influenza. This relationship is driven almost entirely by the severe H1N1 epidemic
in fall 2009. A 10% increase in relative sunlight decreases the influenza index in September or
October by 1.1 points on a 10-point scale. A second, complementary study employs a separate
data set to study flu incidence in counties in New York State. The results are strongly in accord.

1. Introduction
Seasonal influenza has been with humans throughout history (Viboud and Epstein 2016).
It imposes extreme costs on contemporary societies, with the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 – which
actually stretched from 1917 to 1920 -- being a notable high outlier (CDC 2018). Beyond the
significant discomfort to those it strikes, influenza saps productivity when individuals cannot work
(Duarte et al. 2017) and absorbs health care resources (Schanzer and Schwartz 2013). Influenza
also has less known long-range consequences. Notably, individuals exposed to influenza in utero
have lower earnings as adults, are more likely to depend on government assistance (Almond 2006;
Schwandt 2017), and are more likely to suffer from serious health problems later in life (Lin and
Liu 2014). They are also more likely to have a heart attack (Kwong et al. 2018). Influenza severity
can create capacity constraints on hospitals, magnifying existing disparities in whom a hospital
chooses to admit (Alexander and Currie 2017). Finally, influenza infections can cause an untimely
death. The parallels between the consequences of and measures to combat flu and COVID-19 have
stimulated far greater attention to flu in light of the latter pandemic.
Influenza is a type of viral respiratory infection. Traditional public health measures to
combat it include vaccination (Maurer 2009; and White 2019) and paid sick leave to keep
contagious workers at home (Barmby and Larguem 2009; Pichler and Ziebarth 2017; Asfaw, Rosa,
and Pana-Cryan 2017; Pichler, Wen, and Ziebarth 2020). Coincidental reductions in interpersonal
contact (such as from holiday school closings and public transportation strikes) can also reduce
prevalence (Adda 2016). Finally, a recent meta-analysis shows that ingested vitamin D pills help
to protect against these types of infections (Martineau et al., 2017). 1

1

The Martineau meta-analysis imposed stringent criteria for including a trial. This minimizes concerns about a variety
of confounding factors, such as selection effects.

1

This paper analyzes the potential of another mechanism for securing vitamin D: direct
bodily production of vitamin D when exposed to sunlight (Holick 2007). This paper tests this
mechanism’s performance directly by studying population-level vitamin D production by humans
experiencing sunlight exposure, using a reduced form analysis of the relationship between flu and
sunlight. 2 While we can ingest vitamin D from many sources, such as fish and fortified milk,
passive exposure to sunlight is a much more effective source. 3 Sunlight as a source has two added
benefits. First, unlike ingested vitamin D, which can become toxic at a certain concentration, the
self-production mechanism does not generate toxic quantities (Holick 2007). Second, a far greater
percent of the population in an area is exposed to sunlight than secures significant vitamin D for
ingestion. Thus, the level of exposure is more likely to be in the range where herd immunity is
significant.
Normally, flu season is in the winter, when both the average and variance of the sunlight
level are low. The experience with the H1N1 flu epidemic in 2009 was dramatically different. The
epidemic peaked much earlier, in the late summer and early fall. Those few months also had lower
than average sunlight. This is sufficient concurrent variation in both sunlight and flu to study the
relationship.

2

This reduced form approach unfortunately prevents us from differentiating among competing mechanisms, such as
ultraviolet light decreasing folate status and hampering immune function (Branda and Eaton 1978; Cohn 2002;
Borradale et al. 2014; Jones et al. 2018) or alternatively deactivating the virus directly (Sagripanti and Lytle 2007).

3

The minimum amount of sunlight exposure (on head, neck, arm, and hands, without sunscreen) necessary to reach
saturation (and therefore produce an effective allotment) varies greatly by latitude, weather, time of year, and skin
tone. In the summer it can be as short as a few minutes; in the winter it can be over an hour. See
http://nadir.nilu.no/~olaeng/fastrt/VitD-ez_quartMEDandMED_v2.html to calculate the minimum effective exposure
time given a certain set of conditions.
Also, an interesting feature of these calculations is that while excessive unprotected sun exposure can lead to sunburn
and increased risk of skin cancer, the minimum exposure time for adequate vitamin D is always less than the minimum
exposure for a sunburn.

2

This relationship between sunlight and flu has been studied in the broader medical literature
(as by Charland et al. 2009; Grant and Giovannucci 2009; and Soebitantyo et al. 2015). Our study
time period also overlaps the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. The relationship between the 2009 H1N1
outbreak and Vitamin D has been studied specifically (e.g., Bruce et al. 2010; Momplaisir et al.
2012; Khare et al. 2013; Urashima et al. 2014), albeit with inconclusive results. Grant and
Giovannucci (2009) is probably the closest to our study in that it uses sunlight data (specifically,
UVB irradiance) and case-fatality rates for the 1918-1919 H1N1 influenza pandemic. It discusses
many of the biological pathways by which vitamin D can help against influenza, including
reducing production of cytokines and the associated inflammation. While multiple flu strains (e.g.,
H1N1 and H5N1, responsible for avian flu) induce a cytokine response, vitamin D did not reduce
the risk of death for mice infected with H5N1 (Grant and Giovannucci 2009).
The studies on the 2009 H1N1 outbreak do not substantively investigate the relationship
between it and sunlight. This paper is therefore the first to investigate the relationship between the
2009 H1N1 outbreak and sunlight, and the first to perform its analysis at two levels of aggregation
(across states in the U.S. and across counties in New York). The results at the two levels are
consistent. 4
Our paper also fits more broadly in the economics literature of the health effects of sunlight.
In previous work, we found a strong protective impact of a pregnant woman’s exposure to sunlight
on later-in-life asthma in her child (Wernerfelt, Slusky, and Zeckhauser 2017). Others have found
4

In Appendix E, we also extend our analysis to mortality, both for the modern period covered in the data in this paper,
but also for the 1918 influenza pandemic given that there are a number of similarities. They are the only two recorded
H1N1 epidemics. They are the two largest epidemics since 1900, though the 1918 epidemic was far worse. The
majority of mortality for the earlier epidemic occurred between October 1918 and January 1919, a similar pattern to
the 2009 epidemic, suggesting that sunlight might have played a role. The 1918 case has been studied extensively in
the economics literature as a driver of adverse outcomes apart from health (Almond 2006; Brown and Thomas 2018;
Beach, Ferrie, and Saaverda 2018; Fletcher 2018). It has received much less attention in the economics literature as
an adverse outcome itself (Clay, Lewis, and Severini 2018; Clay, Lewis, and Severini 2019). None of these latter
studies considered sunlight.

that sunlight exposure in utero favorably affects birth weight and gestational age (Trudeau,
Conway, and Menclova 2016; Zhang, Chen, Wang, and Zhang 2020), and also favorably affects
fertility (Conway and Trudeau 2019).

2. Data
For influenza data, we used data from the CDC. For cases of flu, we used the CDC index
that aggregates data reports from the individual state health department influenza surveillance
points, and then harmonizes the aggregate to a consistent 10-point scale. The scale measures the
ratio of visits to outpatient healthcare providers by those with symptoms of influenza, relative to
all outpatient visits (regardless of symptoms). Each point on the scale represents an additional
standard deviation above the mean. Weekly state-level data are available, from October 2008 to
the present. 5 Some states, however, are missing individual weeks of data. Dropping the
jurisdictions with missing flu data or sunlight data leaves us with 28 states for our primary analysis
sample (CDC 2017a). 6
We combined this flu data with the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB)’s daily
sunlight data for 2003-2016. It covers all states but Alaska, plus the District of Columbia. This
data reports the solar radiation for a particular set of coordinates (in watts per square meter). We
calculate our primary independent variable by downloading the hourly sunlight data for the
population-weighted county centroid, averaging across each week, and then constructing a county

5

See Appendix A for more details about the how the index is calculated.

6

Those 28 states are: Alabama, Arizona, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. As shown in
Appendix Table 1, when we include all 49 states with sunlight and flu data (plus the District of Columbia), using
whatever data is available for each month, we find consistent results.

4

population-weighted average across counties for each state-week (Census 2010). 7 The dataset also
includes data on temperature and humidity. While our influenza data only begins in 2008, earlier
data was used solely for placebo tests (NREL 2018). For one of our robustness checks, we also
include precipitation data (which is not in NSRDB) from NOAA’s Global Surface Summary of
the Day (NOAA 2017), which utilizes data from 1,218 weather stations spread throughout the
United States. We assigned this data to states by matching the station closest to the populationweighted centroid for each county and then averaging with in each state-week across counties, as
described above (Census 2010). 8
We supplement our state-level analysis with a county-level analysis, following Alexander
and Curie (2017), who construct a ZIP-code level weekly flu measure for New Jersey. Here, we
use SPARCS hospital discharge data (New York State Department of Health 2015) for all of New
York for October 2008 (the earliest month we have CDC flu data) to June 2014 (the last year for
which we have discharge data and the last quarter for which we have bed data).

3. Methodology
As described above, Martineau et al. (2017)’s meta-analysis of randomized controls
demonstrated significant benefits of vitamin D supplements for reducing the likelihood that an
individual will contract an acute upper respiratory infection. Randomized controlled trials have
served as the gold standard for epidemiological investigation. This analysis follows an alternate
path to methodological soundness. It employs quasi-experimental variation to effectively create
equivalent randomization, a common econometric technique. Implicitly, this approach controls for

Appendix D shows comparable results using census tract level sunlight for the 100 largest counties in the U.S.

The correlation between the week-month average temperature variables from the two data sets is 0.9947, suggestions
that there is no issue with combining weather variables from both.

5

a wide number of variables. It thereby avoids the inevitable selection problems that arise when
individuals must volunteer for randomized controlled trials. The current study thus employs an
independent variable over which individuals had effectively no control: the deviation of a state's
sunlight from its normal level.
Ideally, an econometric study would run a two-stage instrumental variable analysis, where
the first stage used sunlight to predict vitamin D levels and the second stage used predicted vitamin
D levels to predict influenza. Unfortunately, we lack any large scale, geo-tagged data on vitamin
D levels. In its stead, our analysis employs a “reduced form” estimate of sunlight’s impact on
influenza. Given that sunlight levels in a geographic area for a particular week vary randomly over
the years, this provides us with a robust estimate.
Vitamin D is fat-soluble (unlike vitamin C, for example, which is water-soluble) and,
therefore, has a half-life of between two weeks and two months (Mawer, Schaefer, Lumb, and
Stanbury 1971; and Jones 2008). Thus, we are most interested in, and therefore calculate, the
sunlight received over the week of the influenza report and seven weeks prior. This choice of
windows is conservative, for two reasons: if the half-life is long, it includes the right window; if
the half-life is short, it includes extra information, which would bias our results downwards. 9
Our variable is a weighted average (by county population). Such weighting is important,
because the more populous areas have a greater impact on the flu index, which is a function of the
count of outpatient visits.

9

Appendix Table C10 re-estimates our main results for past windows of two to seven weeks and finds all are
statistically significant and directionally consistent, with the magnitude increasing with the length of the window.

6

We estimate the impact of the percent of deviation of sunlight (the change in log points,
following Wernerfelt, Slusky, and Zeckhauser 2017) from its mean on deviations of the flu index
from its mean as follows:
𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛾𝛾 ln�𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 � +𝛉𝛉𝐖𝐖𝐖𝐖𝐖𝐖𝐖𝐖𝐖𝐖𝐖𝐖𝐖𝐖𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝐬𝐬𝐬𝐬𝐬𝐬𝐬𝐬𝐬𝐬𝐬𝐬𝐬𝐬𝐬𝐬𝐬𝐬 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐲𝐲𝐲𝐲𝐲𝐲𝐲𝐲𝑦𝑦 +𝜀𝜀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠

Fluswy is the flu index for state s in week w in flu year y. By flu year, we mean the twelve months
from July 1 of one year to June 30 of the next year, denoted by the first of the two years (e.g., flu
year 2009 is July 2009 to June 2010). Given that influenza troughs in the summer, this prevents an
artificial break between December and January in the middle of a flu season. Sunlightswy refers to
the average sunlight for week w and the prior seven weeks (as described above) for state s in year
y. 10 We use the epidemiological definition of a week (always Sunday-Saturday), which is the CDC
standard. 11 γ is our coefficient of interest.
There is a chance that our results could be picking up some other kind of weather variation.
Hence, we include a vector of weather controls in Weather. These controls include temperature,
given that it is known to have health effects (Deschenes 2013; Barreca, Deschenes, and Guldi
2018; Barreca et al. 2016; and Huetal, Miller, and Molitor 2020). Also, following Barreca,
Deschenes, and Guldi (2018) and Wernerfelt, Slusky, and Zeckhauser (2017), we control for the
number of days per week that a state experiences extreme cold (daily low temperature below 15°F).
Such a measure is merited, because the influenza virus can survive better at lower temperatures
(Polozov et al. 2008). Absolute humidity can also play a role in influenza mortality. Prior work
identifies a negative nonlinear relationship between humidity and influenza, where levels below 6

10

Wernerfelt, Slusky, and Zeckhauser (2017) use data from the American Time Use Survey to show that relatively
increases in sunlight increase relative time spent outdoors. We rely on their validation of this measure of sunlight and
do not repeat their analysis.

g of water vapor per kg of air had a substantial impact (per Barreca 2016; Barreca and Shimshack
2012). 12 Finally, we include precipitation, as it is possible that a lack of sunlight is acting through
this channel.
Our preferred specification also includes interaction terms (stateweek) for state-week fixed
effects (for example, week 40 in Kansas), and flu year fixed effects (for example, July 2009-June
2010). 13 Robust standard errors are clustered at the state level. 14 Flu year fixed effects are also
particularly appropriate given that the specific strains of influenza differ from year to year and
vary significantly in their intensities (hence visits to the hospital if infected) and degrees of
contagion. This specification follows our prior work examining the link between sunlight and
vitamin D in relation to asthma (Wernerfelt, Slusky, and Zeckhauser 2017).
To evaluate and bolster the robustness of our results, we conducted a second analysis at the
county level in New York State. That analysis followed the methodology of Alexander and Currie
(2017) for constructing a local measure of influenza intensity. The method of the county analysis
can be briefly described as follows:
1. Identify all emergency department discharges and all inpatient discharges with an
emergency department indicator (since those admitted from the ED drop out of the ED
file).

12

Specific humidity is not directly provided in the NSRDB data, so we calculated it using the available information
on dew point and atmospheric pressure and the Tetens equation. See
http://snowball.millersville.edu/~adecaria/ESCI241/esci241_lesson06_humidity.pdf for the necessary formulas.

13

Previous literature on the relationship between sunlight and flu (including Charland et al. 2009; Grant and
Giovannucci 2009; and Soebitantyo et al. 2015) does not make use of fixed effects models. Given the substantial
variation in latitude, weather sunlight and flu severity across states, fixed effects are crucial to ensure that estimates
measure the impact of relative sunlight variation on relative flu variation, as opposed to merely identifying simple
correlations.
14

We also estimate our main state-level and county-level results adjusting for spatial correlation, using the "acreg"
function available at https://acregstata.weebly.com/ (Colella et a. 2019). Using a conservative distance cutoff of
10,000 km (so that any state in the contiguous United States and certainly any county in New York State could be
spatially correlated with another), we find results that are still statistically significant nationally (p-value < 0.001)
and for New York (p-value = 0.018).

8

2. Keep those emergency discharges with an influenza diagnosis (CCS 15 code of 123) and
inpatient discharges with an influenza diagnosis that was present on arrival.
3. Use the admitted date to assign an epidemiological week.
We use these counts of influenza discharges to construct a county-level measure, again
following Alexander and Currie (2017). Briefly, the steps are as follows:
1. For each hospital, merge in bed data (New York State Department of Health 2016) 16 and
divide the number of admissions in that week by the number of beds to get the per bed
admissions rate.
2. For each county centroid (Census 2010), calculate the great circle distance to the
geocoded coordinates of each hospital’s address.
3. For each hospital within 100 miles, divide the per bed influenza rate by the distance
between the county and the hospital and then sum to get the county level influenza flu
index
We then merged this county-level influenza measure with the county-level sunlight and weather
data from NSRDB. New York has 62 counties, hence slightly more than the 28 units in the main
analysis.

4. Results
As mentioned above, our time period overlaps the H1N1 epidemic of 2009. This is crucial,
because of both the timing and severity of that season (CDC 2017b), as shown in Figure 1. Warmer
colors represent earlier years, and cooler colors later years. Here a year refers to a July-June flu
year denoted, as described above, by the first calendar year involved, i.e., the one starting in July.

Here, we see that the 2009 flu year was extremely atypical. It was by far both the most severe and
occurred much earlier in the year (weeks 33 to 48, corresponding to August to November) than
any other. Its level of greatest severity occurred during a time of the year with more sunlight overall

10

as well as much more sunlight variation around long-term average levels). No other flu year
approached its extreme outlier status on any of these measures. 17,18

Note: Unit of observation is a year-week for each of the 28 states that have complete flu and
sunlight data.
We see that the flu index varies between 1 and 10, with an average level of 2. Sunlight also varies
widely, specifically by latitude, weather, and season. Temperature and humidity also vary
extensively.
Table 2 shows our initial regression results for the impact of sunlight on the influenza
index, using the state-month and year fixed effect strategy described above.

17

We also examine variation in population-weighted sunlight averages (in kilojoules per square meter per day).
Appendix Figure B1 shows the three-year (2009-2016) average. We see the expected pattern, which is that the United
States is sunnier in the south and west. Appendix Figure B2 then shows the variation by state in the average influenza
index. Here we see a somewhat different pattern than in Appendix Figure B1. Some sunny states have high flu levels
(such as Texas and California), and some low flu levels (for instance, Arizona). Moreover, some less sunny states also
have high flu levels (such as Illinois), and some have low flu levels (such as Maine and New Hampshire). Still, the
correlation between the two is 0.53, which is statistically significant at the 1% level (p value = 0.0037). This simple
analysis, though, pools seasons and years. Other state-specific factors may influence influenza levels, which makes
controlling for state-specific fixed effects important.
18

Appendix Figure B3 addresses this issue. It plots the ranges of influenza and sunlight by month. The top half of that
figure shows that there is flu activity in the late summer, fall, and winter, but that activity is minimal in the spring and
summer (except in outlier situations). The lower half shows the expected seasonal variation in sunlight levels, with
large amounts of sunlight in the spring and summer and substantially less in the fall and winter.

Notes: 2008-2016. All regressions include state-week and flu year fixed effects. The panel consists
of the 28 states that have complete flu and sunlight data. Weather level controls include the log of
temperature, specific humidity, and precipitation. Weather thresholds include extreme cold (daily
low temperature below 15°F) and low humidity (below 6 g of water vapor per kg of air). Robust
standard errors clustered at the state level in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1
Column (1) of Table 2 shows that a 10% increase in the average sunlight over the past two months
reduces the 10-point flu index by 0.1403.
However, Table 2 includes months that have minimal influenza activity, and also months
that have low levels of sunlight. Including these months dramatically reduces the magnitude of the
coefficients, and diminishes measured seasonality in the results.
Table 3 re-estimates our model for each month of flu data after including the impact of that
month and the prior month’s sunlight. State-week and flu-year fixed effects are still included. 19

We assign weeks to a month based on the last day (Saturday) of the week. Given variations in what day of the week
a month starts on and the length of each month, each month does have exactly the same sample size.

Because the flu data begins in October 2008, the regressions for October, November, and December have an additional year of observations for each of the 28
states included in the primary analytic sample.

It shows that September influenza (that is, August and September sunlight), and to a lesser extent
October influenza (that is, September and October sunlight) are driving our results. These months
meet the dual requirements (as shown in Appendix Figure B3) of non-trivial level of influenza
activity and still-substantial levels of sunlight. For these two months, shown in Column (13), a
10% increase in relative sunlight levels leads to a 1.1-point decline in the influenza index.
Table 3 shows that the statistically significant results are found primarily in the late summer
and early fall, and Figure 1 shows that the majority of flu cases in this time of year were in the
H1N1 epidemic of 2009. Those results might lead one to wonder whether our results are present
in years other than 2009. Table 4 shows several analyses for that year alone, and for all of the other
years.

Columns (1)-(3) in Panel A show the results of regressing the flu index for a state and month on
the log sunlight for that month and the prior month for only the 12 months in 2009. For any
category of months (all, August-October, or September-October) there is a negative relationship
between sunlight levels and flu that is strong both statistically and in magnitude.
In theory, this association could be endogenous: individuals who chose to live in each of
these states could have chosen it understanding of how sunny it is on average each month.
Therefore, following the spirit of the main analysis above, we instead calculate differences from
the state-week mean value, as log points for sunlight, and as points on the flu index for its
incidence. This then measures not the level of sunlight but the difference in sunlight when
compared to an average year. That independent variable should be exogenous. Analysis with these
endogenous variables yields much larger results. The results differ little with and without August
flu. Going forward, we therefore stick to September and October flu.
Finally, in Panel B, we re-estimate the main model in its normal form (i.e., year and stateweek fixed effects), but excluding the data from 2009. We find, if anything, marginally statistically

15

significant positive results. This further supports our hypothesis that 2009 was a special flu year,
with an early and intense season. That year is responsible for any cross-year results.
We can also see this result in graphical form. Figure 2 graphs the deviations in the
September and October influenza index and the log level of August/September and
September/October sunlight from the mean for each state and month. The vertical axis represents
the residual after regressing the difference in the state-week mean flu index on the difference in
the state-week mean weather controls.

= 2016. Line is linear best fit for 2009. The vertical axis indicates the residual after regressing the
difference in the state-week mean flu index on the difference in the state-week mean weather

16

The horizontal axis displays our independent variable, the log of sunlight by date and month. The
vertical axis plots our dependent variable, flu index by state and month, in the difference variables
in log-points calculated for Table 4 above Thus, if sunlight is protective, then the greater its level
for a state and a month, the lesser will be the flu index for that state and month. As can be seen by
the vertical placement of observations in Figure 2, consistent with Figure 1 above, the 2009 flu
season was substantially more severe than any other season in our sample. In addition, there was
substantially less sunlight that year than in the average year, and much more variability in those
deviations. 21 These deviations facilitate estimation. Hence, in 2009 a clear and substantial negative
relationship emerges between relative differences in sunlight and relative differences in flu level.
We now turn to examine, and hopefully replicate, our results at the sub-state level. To
replicate, we first need to show that our results are consistent for at least some subsets of states.22
Table 5 shows our results stratifying by quartiles of overall average sunlight levels. 23 Here we
include all states (even those with missing weeks of influenza data) and all months, both to
maximize statistical power and because the state we will eventually look within (New York) has
only nearly complete CDC data. (It is missing one week of data out of 451 weeks.)

21

Appendix Figure B4 stratifies each of the two panels in Appendix Figure B3 into 2009 and the other years, and also
shows that the fall of 2009 had comparatively more flu and less sunlight.
22
As we’ll show below, our results are robust to omitting each state one at a time, and so are not driven by any
individual state.

Apart from the sunniest quartile of states, our results are broadly consistent across quartiles. We
can therefore proceed to analyze within New York (which falls in the second quartile). 24,25
In Table 6, we that see across a variety of flu measures and sample months the results are
highly consistent with those at the national level, as shown above. 26

24

To validate the county-level approach, following Alexander and Currie, (2017) Appendix Figure B5 compares the
weekly New York State flu index from the CDC (2017a) with the total number of influenza admissions that week in
New York. While our discharge-based measure is less spikey than the CDC’s measure, the two track each other
remarkably well. This is all the more significant given that the CDC measure is based on outpatient office visits and
not emergency department visits.
25

We expand upon Table 5 in Appendix B. Appendix Table B1 investigates further whether our fall (September and
October) results are driven by overall sunniest, the H1N1 epidemic in the fall of 2009, or sunshine variation
specifically in the fall of 2009. We find consistent statistically significant results for the above median sunniest states
and the below median states. We find consistently insignificant results for both groups of states when we exclude
2009. If we instead group states by average deviations from the mean log sunlight level (the horizontal axis in Figure
2), the results are driven entirely by the states that had deviations with magnitudes larger than the median. This
suggests our results are driven both by H1N1 in 2009 and by larger sunlight deviations in those months. They are not
driven by overall sunniness or lack thereof.
Appendix Table B2 considers the typical peak flu months of October to March for the less sunny and more sunny
states. While the point estimates are comparable for the two groups, the effect is highly statistically significant (p =
0.003) for the less sunny states and not statistically significant (p = 0.136) for the more sunny states.

26

Appendix Table B3 stratifies the results in Table 6 by race and by age, as the New York State county-based measure
data comes from individual-level discharge data, which contains both of these variables. The hypothesis here is that
sunlight would be more protective to the non-elderly population (under age 65) who are more likely to go outside, and
white individuals given that they convert sunlight to Vitamin D faster. While all of the results are statistically
significant at the 1% level, the results are much larger in magnitude for white and non-elderly individuals.

We now stratify the New York results by years, as above. Table 7 is analogous to Table
4, first looking at only 2009, and then at the rest of the years excluding 2009. This separation
tells if our results appear in only 2009, given that it is the source of our late summer/early fall flu
variation, or in other years as well.

27

While there are no state-weeks with zero precipitation, there are a handful of county-weeks that have zero
precipitation, making it impossible to take the log. We therefore include the level of precipitation instead. In Appendix
Table C7, we show that for the state level results (where we can include either log or level of precipitation) it only
makes a minimal difference which we include (less than 2% in the magnitude of the coefficient). Therefore we do not
think this accommodation here is consequential.

Panel A shows consistent results, both in the cross section and using differences from countymonth averages across all years. The panel B, in Column (1), finds no statistically significant

20

result, analogous to Table 4 above. In Columns (2) and (3), despite excluding 2009, identifies the
statistically significant result that relatively greater levels of fall sunlight led to relatively lower
influenza intensity. The coefficients, however, are a tiny fraction of what they were for 2009.
We now consider Figure 3, analogous to Figure 2. It compares the differences in sunlight
and flu within counties across years. Again, the vertical axis represents the residual after regressing
the difference in the state-week mean flu index on the difference in the state-week mean weather
controls.

Circles = 2015, Black Small Diamonds = 2016. Line is linear best fit for 2009. Y axis is the residual
after regressing difference in state-week mean flu index on difference in state-week mean weather
controls.
21

Here we see a similar relationship to the one above, where the variation is driven by 2009
(consistent with Figures 1 and 2 above). The relationship, as expected, slopes downward (more
sunlight implies less flu). The results are robust to dropping the two outliers at the top left of the
graph (with a difference greater than 3) —see Table 6, Column (3).

5. Robustness Checks
The tables in Appendix C conduct additional robustness checks. Appendix Table C1
repeats the Table 2 analyses, but includes an unbalanced panel of all contiguous states, Hawaii,
and D.C. (i.e., even those with missing influenza data in some weeks). That table shows a
comparable result. It also employs both linear and quadratic specifications. All three specifications
find strongly statistically significant results, though obviously at different coefficient magnitudes.
Appendix Table C2 drops each of the 28 states in the primary specification, one at a time,
to test whether the main result persists if any one state is excluded. The answer is yes. Appendix
Table C3 performs the analysis for only sunlight from each day of the week (e.g., the average
sunlight on Sundays in a given month). It finds that the sunlight for every day of the week has an
impact.
Appendix Table C4 performs the analysis at a monthly level with state-month fixed effects.
The primary variable calculated as the average over the previous two months. The results are
consistent with those found at the week level.
The next three tables all contain variants on our weather controls. Appendix Table C5 adds
weather controls one at a time and finds minimal effect on the primary finding. Appendix Table
C6 uses more flexible dummy variables for ventiles (e.g., 20 bins that at the 5, 10, 15, etc.
percentiles of the variables data) of each weather control, and finds comparable results. Finally,

22

Appendix Table C7 includes the level of precipitation instead of its logarithm; it too finds
comparable results.
Appendix Table C8 controls for the annual flu vaccine match rate, using data from White
(2019). Because this control is collinear with the flu year fixed effects, the results employ one or
the other but not both. Including the flu vaccine match rate produces much larger results in
magnitude, but a much lower r squared. That outcome is consistent with this effectively being a
more rigid form for including flu year fixed effects.
Appendix Table C9 utilizes data on the flu vaccination rates from the Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from (CDC 2019). BRFSS asks individuals not only whether
they've had a flu vaccination in the past 12 months, but also what month they had it in. Given that,
as described above, we define a flu year as from July-June, we can use these two variables to create
a variable for whether each respondent had a flu vaccination in that season. This information can
be aggregated up to a rate at the state-week level. That rate appears in Column (1).
This measure is very noisy, so some adjustments are necessary. First, we linearly
interpolate when there is no respondent in a particular state-week. These interpolated values appear
in Column (2). Then we can also compute a 7-week moving average to smooth out some of the
noise. Those averages are shown in Column (3). Finally, sometimes the vaccination rate appears
to go down. We thus employ a ratchet for each season, so that come November of each flu year it
only goes up and we ignore any data suggesting it would go back down (through May). The
ratcheted values appear in Column (4). Our results are robust to utilizing any of these measures.
Appendix Table C10 reconsiders our choice to use average sunlight data over the previous
eight weeks. It looks instead at all windows from two weeks to seven weeks. The results are all

23

statistically significant at the 1% level, and the magnitude of the coefficient grows with each week
beyond two that is added to the window, which suggests a persisting effect of recent sunlight.

6. Discussion
6.1 Impact on welfare. How important are the impacts we identify on welfare? As described
above, each point on the influenza index represents one standard deviation above the mean share
of the non-flu week’s ratio of outpatients presenting with symptoms of influenza to all outpatients
(CDC 2017a). (That data is also available on the actual outpatient counts, though those counts are
not broken down at the state level (CDC 2017b.) In the 2005-2008 “pre-period,” this mean share
is 1.03%, and the standard deviation is 0.394 percentage points. 28
Figure 2 shows that the range of relative sunlight levels for September and October within
state-weeks across years. That range is roughly plus or minus 0.05 log points, that is, 10 percentage
points. Thus, our coefficient for log sunlight shown in Table 3 corresponds to a 1.056-point
reduction in the influenza index, which can be interpreted as approximately 1.056 standard
deviations. Given that one standard deviation is 0.394 percentage points in flu incidence, -1.056
standard deviations represents 0.416 percentage points, which represents a 40% reduction on the
mean of 1.03%.
The average annual number of total outpatients in September and October (weeks 35 to 43)
in our study years (2009-2016) (from CDC 2017b) is 6,342,726. A 0.416 percentage point
reduction in flu incidence would lead to 26,390 fewer outpatient cases.
6.2 Herd Immunity. Giving 100 people in a town of perhaps 10,000 people a vitamin D
supplement will offer extremely few externalities of protection. But give that same town extra

28

See Appendix A for additional calculation details.

24

sunlight, and most members of the community will produce their own vitamin D This mass effect
will convey an externality of protection, namely herd protection against influenza, a highly
communicable disease. 29 Posit that supplements and sunlight-produced vitamin D are equally
powerful. That externality should make the protective effect of sunlight far greater for an
individual than would a vitamin D supplement.
To test this conjecture, we compared our results to those for vitamin D supplementation.
The Martineau et al. (2017) meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials of vitamin D
supplementation found an adjusted odds ratio of 0.88 for acute respiratory tract infections. 42.2%
of the control group experienced at least one acute respiratory tract infection, but only 40.3% of
the treatment group did, thus an unadjusted difference of 1.9 percentage points (4.5%). A possible
contributor to this disparity are the externalities promoting herd immunity when sunlight is the
protective factor. An alternate explanation, of course, is that part or all of the disparity arises
because sunlight produces more vitamin D or more effective vitamin D than supplements.
6.3 Possible alternative mechanisms. Multiple other mechanisms might be at work.
Increased time spent outdoors enjoying the sunlight (and therefore less time in confined indoor
spaces exposed to sick individuals), for example could reduce interpersonal transmission.
Sunlight can also protect against influenza via a path quite apart from the production of
vitamin D. For example, ultraviolet light deactivates the virus directly (Sagripanti and Lytle 2007).
Data beyond that in this paper would be required to assess the relative contributions of time spent
in close proximity to others, virus deactivation, and vitamin D production. However, we can be

29
This herd immunity obviously would also benefit those who do not go outdoors, as the more outdoorsy people with
whom they come in contact would be less likely to be infected and thereby contagious.

25

confident that the vitamin D path is consequential, as the Martineau et al. (2017) meta-analysis
demonstrates.

7. Conclusion
Sunlight, likely operating through the well-established channel of producing vitamin D,
has the potential to play a significant role in reducing flu incidence. A recent meta-analysis of 25
randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation (Martineau et al. 2017) demonstrated
significant benefits of such supplements for reducing the likelihood that an individual will contract
an acute upper respiratory infection. The current study considers sunlight as an alternate, natural
path through which humans can and do secure vitamin D. This study's findings complement and
reinforce the Martineau et al. findings.
Our major result is that incremental sunlight in the late summer and early fall has the
potential to reduce the incidence of influenza. Sunlight had a dramatic effect in 2009, when
sunlight was well below average at the national level, and the flu came early. Our result is
potentially relevant not just to the current COVID-19 pandemic, but also to a future outlier H1N1
pandemic. The threat is there; some H1N1 viruses already exist in animals (Sun et al. 2020). One
must be cautious, though, with generalizations, given the unique economic circumstances (e.g., a
25-year high unemployment rate) in the fall of 2009.
Apart from its methodological contributions, this study reinforces the long-held assertion
that vitamin D protects against acute upper respiratory infections. One can secure vitamin D
through supplements, or through a walk outdoors, particularly on a day when the sun shines
brightly. When most walk, through herd protection, all benefit.

Appendix A: The CDC Flu Index Calculation
We use the weekly count of outpatient visits (both total and only those due to influenza)
from the CDC (2017b) along with the documentation in the ILI data (CDC 2017c) to conduct
calculations regarding the influenza index. That index corresponds to the number of standard
deviations the share of outpatient visits that report influenza symptoms that week exceeds all noninfluenza weeks. A “non-influenza week” is defined as a week in which it and its preceding week
had fewer than 2% of all outpatient visits to healthcare providers indicating influenza.
Our study period is 2008-2016. Hence, we use the October 2005-September 2008 period
as a “pre-period” to calibrate our index. We begin with the formal start of the season, which the
CDC defines as week 40 (the first week of October). Unfortunately, whereas the ILI data (CDC
2017a) is available at the state level, the outpatient visit count data is only available nationally.
Therefore, we conduct our calculations at that level.
Nationally, of the 156 weeks in October 2005-September 2008, 108 fit the above definition
of “non-influenza.” The mean share for those 108 weeks is 1.03%, and their standard deviation is
0.39 percentage points.
Given this, the method for calculating the influenza index is now to take all weeks,
calculate the z-score[s] (that is, number of standard deviations above or below the mean), and then
apply the following index definition:
Flu index =
1

if

Z<0

int(Z) +2

if

0 <Z< 8

10

if

Z>8

32

So, in the interior range of the index, we can consider an additional index point as representing an
additional standard deviation.

Appendix D: Tract Level Analysis
The state-week level sunlight data used in this paper is calculated as a population weighted
average of the sunlight at the coordinates of the centroid for each county in each state. This is
purely for tractability, as sunlight and weather data (excluding precipitation, which is from another
source) must be downloaded for each year for individual set of coordinates, and one can only
download 2000 files per IP address per day. With over 3000 counties in the U.S. and several years
of data (including the placebo years used in the analysis below) it took over a month to just
download the main data for the paper.
One may be worried, though, that for large counties using the county centroid misses intracounty variation in sunlight. There are 74,000 census tracks in the U.S (Census 2000) and so it is
infeasible to download sunlight data for all of their centroids for all years.
In lieu of that, this appendix instead downloads sunlight and weather data for each census
tract in the 100 largest counties by land area in the U.S. (not including Alaska), only for calendar
year 2009 (which is the year that is driving our results). These counties range from San Bernardino
in California (20,000 square miles) to Kane County in Utah (4000 square miles), across 16 states
(Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada,
New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming). Together they have 7200 census
tracts.
This data is then aggregated up to the county level using the same method as the county to
state aggregation in the rest of the paper: a population weighted average. Appendix Figure D1
shows a scatter plot of this average sunlight based on tract data vs. sunlight the county centroid for
this 100 counties.

48

Appendix Figure D1: County Sunlight Averaged from Tracts vs. County Centroid

Notes: 100 larges counties in U.S., which are in Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho,
Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington,
and Wyoming. Red line is best linear fit. 2009 only.
While there are a small number of outliers, the vast majority of points in this graph lie near the
best fit line.
Then this county level data is combined with the main data for the rest of the counties in
each state and aggregated up the state level. Appendix Figure D2 shows the state level averages,
with our normal data on the x-axis and the new data incorporating tract level sunlight on the yaxis.

Notes: Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska,
Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. 2009. Red line is line of
best fit.
This data is very close to the 45 degree line; the correlation is 0.9996
We then repeat the main results of our paper, using the sunlight and weather data from the
tract centroids for the 100 largest counties. (Given that the precipitation data is from weather
stations, we use the same precipitation as the main analysis.)

Appendix E: Mortality in 2009 and in the 1918 pandemic
Given the strong relationship between relative levels of influenza cases and sunlight in
2009, one would think that sunlight might also affect mortality rates per case. To study this
question, we conduct an analysis for mortality data for recent years. We also repeat our analysis
using historical mortality data for the 1918 influenza pandemic. 30
The methodology for the mortality analysis follows the format above with a few necessary
modifications. First, whereas we have CDC influenza index data back to October of 2008,
mortality data specific to influenza and pneumonia are only available back to October of 2009. We
therefore re-estimate our main results using the same period to show that they are consistent.
Second, working with the early 20th century data imposed a number of limitations. The
mortality data is at the annual level, and not the month level. Given that 85% of the pandemic
mortality occurred between October 1918 and January 1919 (Almond 2006), and based on our
other results, we estimate the impact of either August-September or August-December sunlight
from a given year on the mortality for that year.
Finally, we have both sunlight and mortality data for very few states before 1918. Thus,
we average across all of the stations in a given state and year, and only keeping states that have
data for 1918. This provides a balanced panel of 29 states for the years 1918 to 1936. 31
For mortality data, we use CDC data on both the absolute number of individuals who die
from influenza as well as pneumonia in each state and week and the share they comprise of total

30
We know of no data on cases of influenza for the early 20th century period, and so unfortunately cannot also repeat
our cases-level analysis.

deaths. Both indicators are commonly reported by the CDC, 32 as some influenza deaths, are
associated with secondary complications of influenza, including pneumonia, and so are recorded
as such on the death certificate. 33 Unlike the influenza index described above, the CDC does not
convert these numbers into a 10-point index (CDC 2019).
Our mortality data for 1900-1936, by state, year, and cause of death, comes from Cutler
and Miller (2005) and Anderson, Charles, and Rees (2018). Both sets of authors provided identical
data. That data only covers 10 states in 1900, but it gradually increases to 30 states in 1918 and 48
in 1936. Our sunlight data for 1891-1987 for 240 weather stations at the year and month level, is
from Steurer and Karl (2012).
Results: Mortality In the Modern Period
First, consider a figure analogous to Figure 1, but now for the percentage of deaths from
pneumonia or influenza.

we only have mortality data back to October of 2009
Similarly, in Panel B, we see that 2009 was also only an outlier in timing and not in magnitude for
deaths only from influenza.
We can also make a figure analogous to Figure 2 where we plot the log difference in
sunlight from the state-month mean for sunlight and the percentage point difference in the share
of deaths from the state-month mean. Note that due to the mortality data starting only in October

55

of 2009, these graphs are only for mortality data for the month of October for the years 2009-2016,
and the corresponding sunlight data in September-October of those years. 34

state-week mean flu index on difference in state-week mean weather controls.

Appendix Figure B2 shows Figure 2 for influenza cases for only the month of October (and therefore SeptemberOctober sunlight), and demonstrates that the main relationship found in this paper is still present.

= 2016. Line is linear best fit for 2009. Vertical axis is the residual after regressing difference in
state-week mean flu index on difference in state-week mean weather controls.
Unlike in Figure 2, above, here we do not see a negative relationship, and conceivably even a weak
positive relationship between relative levels of sunlight and mortality.
Appendix Table E1 then repeats our above analysis for the mortality data. Here we use
October mortality data for 2009-2016, and September mortality data for 2010-2016.

Column 1 shows our main result from Column 6 of Appendix Table C5, estimated for the same
months as the mortality regressions. While we lose an order of magnitude when dropping
September 2009, our result is still large and statistically significant.
Columns 2-5 show small and statistically insignificant coefficients for the effects on the
share of deaths from influenza. This is true regardless of whether one only uses states with nonmissing data or all states, or either outcome measure.
To better understand this null result, we combine the two panels of Appendix Figure E1
with Figure 1 to calculate deaths per case by week and year. The panel A shows deaths for
pneumonia or influenza, where Panel B shows only deaths from influenza. The denominator is
the same in both graphs, namely cases of influenza.

These figures help us solve the puzzle of why sunlight and cases are so closely related in the fall
of 2009 but sunlight and mortality are not. The answer is that mortality per case is in general much
lower in the fall than it is in the winter. The cases for 2009 were overwhelmingly in the fall.
Historical Mortality, Starting with 1918
We now turn to the mortality analysis for the 1918 influenza pandemic. We first create
figures analogous to Figure 2 and Appendix Figure E2, albeit at the month level. Given that there
are 19 years of data, we color all years other than 1918 the same for clarity.

Notes: Red Circles = 1918; Black x’s: 1919-1936. Line is linear best fit for 1918.
First, is it clear from both pictures that the 1918 flu represents a large deviation from the average.
In that year, the share of deaths from influenza was 15-20 percentage points higher than subsequent
years.
Appendix Table E2 shows analogous null regression results. This is the case regardless of
whether sunlight for only August-September or for August-December is used.

As shown above, we find no impact of relative sunlight on mortality rates. This would
suggest that the fewer cases we find came from the most healthy individuals (who were unlikely
to die from influenza) and not from the least healthy (who were most likely to die) or equally from
the entire distribution.

Appendix F: Placebo Tests Utilizing Data from Other Years
To provide an additional check on the robustness of our results, we conduct placebo tests
using sunlight data from other years to predict influenza rates for a particular year. Appendix Table
F1 parallels Table 3. It adds lagged sunlight and weather controls for years before the treatment
period and leads of sunlight and weather controls for years after treatment period to provide those
tests. Our primary coefficient retains its statistical significance, even when multiple other
independent variables are included. Moreover, adding these variables only provides a modest
upward nudge to the R-square values.

Notes: Flu years 2008-2012. All regressions include state-week and flu year fixed effects and weather controls. September and October only. Robust standard
errors clustered at the state level in parentheses. The panel consists of the 28 states that have complete flu and sunlight data. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

This placebo test does identify statistically significant coefficients on other years, most
notably on one year forward. For this test to be meaningful requires two previously unstated
assumptions. First, the sunlight in a placebo year could not possibly influence the flu in the studied
year. Second, sunlight in a placebo year, when looking across states, could not be strongly
correlated with sunlight in the studied year.
Unfortunately, the sunlight data fails the second assumption, as there are multiple
correlated years, the most extreme being the fall of 2009 and 2010. The following figures show
those correlations. The figures show differences from the mean, as that is analogous to flu year
fixed effect structure of the regressions. To avoid a mechanism correlation, the differences are
relative to the 2003-2007 state-month mean.
First, Appendix Figure F1 shows a scatter plot of state level difference 2009 vs 2010, where
September is in red and October is in blue. There are 100 pairs of points, as we including
Washington, D.C. but excluding Alaska, consistent with our data.

Appendix Figure F1: State Differences in Sunlight in 2009 vs 2010

Notes: Differences from state-month mean for 2003-2007. Red dots are September and blue dots
are October. Green line is linear best fit for the pooled data set of both months,
Surprisingly, the deviations in sunlight in 2010 are strongly negatively correlated with the
deviations in 2009, the overwhelmingly relevant year. The correlation between the differences
from the mean in the two years is -0.45, which is statistically significant at the 1% level. That
implies that employing one-year ahead as a placebo year would be inappropriate.
Appendix Figure F2 then shows the September and October average differences from the
mean for each state and each year.

Appendix Figure F2:
Panel A: Sunlight in September & October 2009, Differences from the mean

Panel B: Sunlight in September & October 2010, Differences from the mean

Notes: Lighter colors mean more relative sunlight, darker colors mean less relative sunlight. Scale
is the same in both figures.

The figure shows the strong negative correlation between relative sunlight in the fall of 2009 and
the fall of 2010. Given that the 2009 flu season was overwhelmingly responsible for our results,
the one-year ahead lead is not an appropriate placebo test for our results.
In the final column of Appendix Table F1, we remove the one-year-ahead independent
variables, and include only the previous five years and two and three years ahead. Here, our main
coefficient is still highly statistically significant, and has a magnitude close to our main result.
While we do see one other placebo result that is statistically significant, it is only at the 5% level
and so unlike the main result would not survive an adjustment for testing multiple hypotheses.
