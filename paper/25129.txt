Navigating Complex Financial Decisions at Retirement: Evidence from Annuity Choices in
Public Sector Pensions

NBER Working Paper No. 25129
October 2018
JEL No. G2,H55,H7
ABSTRACT
Choices regarding the disposition of wealth at retirement can have substantial implications for
retirement income security. We analyze the factors determining annuity option choices offered
by a public sector defined pension plan with no default annuity option. Using combined
administrative records and survey data, we explore the role of individual and household
characteristics as well as risk preferences, time preferences, and financial literacy. The evidence
is consistent with predictions over which households might benefit most from each annuity
option. Comparing retirees who chose different annuities, we find that these groups of retirees
report very different levels of well-being in retirement.

Navigating Complex Financial Decisions at Retirement:
Evidence from Annuity Choices in Public Sector Pensions

I.

Introduction
At retirement, pension participants must decide the type of pension distribution that they

believe will maximize their utility over the rest of their lifetime. Private sector defined benefit
pension plans are regulated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which
specifies how various distribution options are priced and requirements concerning the choice of
annuities. In general, public sector plans are not covered by ERISA, so government agencies
have greater flexibility in determining the provisions of their retirement plans. Moreover, state
and local government employees often retire in their 50’s because public sector defined benefit
plans typically allow career retirees to begin benefits at relatively young ages. Thus, state and
local employees must select the payout method that maximizes their well-being over 30 or more
years of retirement. In this environment, retirees face a complex decision in choosing the most
appropriate annuity option that will maximize their lifetime utility. Poor choices based on
insufficient information or knowledge may result in unanticipated outcomes and cause retirees to
express regret about their pension decisions later in retirement.
This paper analyzes annuity choices by pension participants using administrative records
and survey data on North Carolina public sector retirees from 2009-2014. The estimation
follows a nested logit regression model, which allows a flexible correlation structure for the
unobserved factors affecting annuity choice. In a sample of married retirees, we find important
roles for gender, race/ethnicity, own and spouse’s life expectancy, and age and spouse’s relative
age in determining who elects each payout option. Prior research, focusing primarily on choices
by retirees in private sector plans, has explored the tendency of individuals to under-annuitize
1

wealth. 1 In sharp contrast to pension distributions chosen by private sector workers, retirees in
the public sector rarely select lump sum distributions because of the way they are typically
priced. Public sector retirees generally have the option of selecting from a menu of lifetime
annuities or a lump sum distribution. Under ERISA, private sector plans must have a default
annuity option of a joint and survivor benefit with at least 50 percent of the joint benefit payable
to the survivor and the pricing of annuity options must meet certain requirements. 2 In the public
sector, there is not typically a default annuity option and often annuity options are priced so that
they are present value neutral to the retirement system. Thus, it is important to understand why
retirees choose an annuity and how these decisions affect retirement well-being.
This study uses the North Carolina Retirement Transitions Study-Benefit Claimants
(NCRTS-BC) data, which consists of administrative records merged with survey data for state
and local government retirees in North Carolina who initiated retirement benefits between 2009
and 2014. We focus on married retirees which allows us to study the role of spousal
characteristics in annuity choice. This is best suited for cases when a married individual’s
spouse would be their beneficiary had they chosen a J&S annuity option. While we cannot
directly test this assumption, we find evidence that is consistent with spouses as the vast majority

Reuter 2012; and Butler and Teppa 2007.

The initial 1974 ERISA legislation required that pension plans offer at least a 50 percent J&S annuity

and that it be the default distribution option in the plan; however, retirees could simply request a single
life annuity when claiming benefits. The Retirement Equity Act of 1984 required a spouse to sign a
notarized consent form waiving her right to the J&S before the retiree could receive a single life annuity.

of beneficiaries for married individuals. 3 For these married retirees, the spousal characteristics
are drawn from a retirement decision-making survey conducted in 2015 (one to six years after
the claiming decision for these retirees). Finally, we study retirement well-being, including
satisfaction with choices upon retirement and income security in retirement, which provides a
snapshot of perceived well-being several years into retirement. Combining administrative
records and responses to two surveys, our data provide a comprehensive picture of annuity
choice among public sector retirees in North Carolina.
II.

Background on North Carolina Retirement Plans and Annuity Options
We examine the provisions of public retirement systems of North Carolina and the

annuity choices of recent retirees. The retirement plan for teachers and state employees and the
state-managed pension plan for local employees in North Carolina are typical of state and local
pension plans across the country. Teachers and state employees in North Carolina are covered
by the Teachers’ and State Employees’ Retirement System (TSERS), while local government
workers participate in the Local Governmental Employees’ Retirement System (LGERS).
Almost all participants in both plans are also covered by Social Security and TSERS pension
annuitants are also allowed to remain in the state health plan. 4
The parameters of TSERS and LGERS are very similar. In order to qualify for normal or
unreduced benefits, the employee must have satisfied one of three criteria: reached age 65 with 5
years of membership service; reached age 60 with 25 years of service; or have attained 30 years
of service at any age. Early retirement with reduced benefits is available to those who have

3

The initial survey asked respondents whom they chose as their beneficiary. Among married individuals

who indicated that they chose J&S, 93.3 percent reported that their spouse/partner was their beneficiary.

See Clark and Cowell (2017) for a review of the annuity options of 85 large state-managed public plans.

reached age 50 and completed 20 years of creditable service and those who have reached age 60
and completed 5 years of service. Thus, for many public employees in North Carolina, these
plans provide a strong economic incentive to retire in their 50’s.
Upon termination and achieving the age and service requirements, retirees must request
from the retirement system that their benefits begin and the annuity option they desire. This is a
one-time option and no benefits are paid until the benefit request has been finalized. In other
words, there is no default benefit. Both plans have the same six annuity options, which include a
single life annuity (called the maximum benefit), a 100 percent J&S, a 50 percent J&S, Social
Security Leveling, and two additional J&S options with a pop-up provision if the retiree’s
beneficiary dies first. Plan actuaries set the terms of all annuity options so that they are
considered present value neutral to the system. 5 There is also an option to take a lump sum
withdrawal, but most benefit claimants with long careers find that the present value of the
annuity greatly exceeds the lump sum (Clark et al. 2014).
III.

Annuity Options in the North Carolina Retirement Plans
We now present a more detailed discussion of the pricing of the annuity options. The

benefit formula in the plan indicates the monthly retirement benefit that a retiree would receive
from claiming until death. As discussed earlier, the retirement benefit is a function of years of

5

In this context, present value neutral to the retirement system means that the discounted value of the

maximum benefit from retirement to death is expected to be equivalent to the discounted value of lifetime
benefits of all other options using the assumed rate of return to the plan’s assets. The discounted value is
calculated assuming no cost-of-living adjustments. Historically, cost-of-living adjustments have averaged
close to the annual increase in CPI; in recent years, there have been few increases in benefits.

4

service and final average salary. This is a single life annuity that is called the maximum benefit. 6
Once the conditions for unreduced retirement are satisfied, the monthly benefit does not depend
on age.
To determine the monthly benefit for other annuity options, the first step is to calculate
the expected present value of the maximum benefit. First, define PV[A] to be the present value
of a $1 per year benefit payable in equal monthly payments for the life of an individual age A:
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝐴𝐴] =

𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏

�

𝒂𝒂=𝑨𝑨+𝟏𝟏

𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝒂𝒂𝑨𝑨
+ 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶
(𝟏𝟏 + 𝒓𝒓𝒊𝒊 )𝒂𝒂−𝑨𝑨

where Survival is the probability of survival from age A to age a, ri is the assumed interest rate,
and CtsAdj is the industry-standard 11/24ths adjustment for monthly payment. Then the present
value of the monthly maximum benefit, BMAX, can be written as:
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 [𝐴𝐴] = 𝐵𝐵𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 ∗ 12 ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝐴𝐴]

This calculation is based on the mortality experience of the system and the assumed rate
of return on the pension fund. Prior to 2012, the interest rate was 7.5 percent; however, the rate
was changed to 7.25 percent in 2012. Thus, for individuals with the same career history, the
present value of the maximum benefit decreases as age of claiming increases and there will be a
small increase in present values for those claiming benefits after 2012.
Having calculated the present value of the maximum benefit, the retirement system then
calculates a monthly benefit the other five annuity options using the same basic assumptions.
Joint and Survivor Annuities

6

If the worker dies before paid benefits exceed lifetime employee contributions plus interest, a lump sum

is paid to the designated survivor.

5

The state provides four J&S options that provide for the continuation of benefits after the
death of the retired worker that are paid to the survivor until his or her death. The first option
offered by the North Carolina retirement plans is a 100 percent J&S benefit, which results in the
retirement benefit being the same as long as either the retiree or survivor is alive. For the present
value of this annuity to be the same as that of the maximum benefit, monthly benefits must be
lower. The price of this insurance for a lifetime benefit, or the magnitude of the reduction in
monthly benefits, depends on the age of the retiree and the age of the survivor. To calculate the
present value of the J&S benefit, first define the present value of a $1 per year benefit payable in
equal monthly payments if and only if both annuitants are living:
𝑃𝑃𝑉𝑉𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽 [𝐴𝐴, 𝑆𝑆] = �

𝒂𝒂=𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏,𝒔𝒔=𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏

�

𝒂𝒂=𝑨𝑨+𝟏𝟏,𝒔𝒔=𝑺𝑺+𝟏𝟏

𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝒂𝒂,𝒔𝒔
𝑨𝑨,𝑺𝑺
� + 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶
(𝟏𝟏 + 𝒓𝒓𝒊𝒊 )𝒂𝒂−𝑨𝑨

where Survival is the joint probability of the retiree surviving from age A to age a and the spouse
surviving from age S to age s. Then the present value of the monthly J&S benefit, BJ&S, is:
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐽𝐽&𝑆𝑆 [𝐴𝐴, 𝑆𝑆] = 𝐵𝐵𝐽𝐽&𝑆𝑆 ∗ 12 ∗ �𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝐴𝐴] + 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃&𝑆𝑆 ∗ (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝑆𝑆] − 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽 [𝐴𝐴, 𝑆𝑆])�

where PctJ&S is either 50 percent or 100 percent depending on the option chosen.

To illustrate how the price varies across retirees, we present hypothetical monthly
benefits for several scenarios in Table 1. The mean married retiree in our sample claims benefits
at age 60 and the retiree’s spouse is on average one year older. Panel A shows the monthly
benefit for a 60 year old claimant whose maximum benefit is fixed at $2,000 per month. Panel A
assumes that the retiree’s spouse is 61 years old. For such a retiree, the 100 percent J&S benefit
is $1,813 per month, while the 50 percent J&S benefit is $1,902 per month. Since the benefit
after the death of the retiree is lower with the 50 percent J&S option, the benefit while the retiree
is alive is greater than the 100 percent J&S. The popup J&S options increase the benefits for the

6

retiree if the beneficiary dies prior to the retiree. Relative to the standard J&S option without a
popup provision, the monthly benefit will be lower if the popup option is selected: $1,785 and
$1,887 per month for 100 percent popup and 50 percent popup J&S, respectively. Panels B and
C show the effect of own and spouse age on the 100 percent and 50 percent J&S benefit,
respectively. Moving right (up) in a given row (column) shows the benefit increase associated
with an older beneficiary (younger retiree).
[Table 1]
Social Security Leveling
The final annuity option is called Social Security Leveling. Retirees selecting this option
receive a higher monthly benefit prior to age 62 when an individual is first eligible to claim
Social Security benefits and in return, the pension benefit is lower after age 62. The benefits
before and after age 62 are calculated by the system, using the same assumptions as described
before, so that the expected present value of the two Leveling benefits is the same as the present
value of the maximum benefit. 7 To calculate the present value of the Leveling benefit, first
define the present value of a $1 per year benefit payable in equal monthly payments that begin at
age C for a retiree currently age A:
𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏

𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝐴𝐴, 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐶𝐶] = �� �
Next define F[A,C] as follows:

𝒂𝒂=𝑪𝑪+𝟏𝟏

𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝒂𝒂𝐶𝐶
𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑪𝑪𝑨𝑨
�
+
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶�
∗
(𝟏𝟏 + 𝒓𝒓𝒊𝒊 )𝒂𝒂−𝑪𝑪
(𝟏𝟏 + 𝒓𝒓𝑖𝑖 )𝑪𝑪−𝑨𝑨

𝐹𝐹[𝐴𝐴, 𝐶𝐶] = 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝐴𝐴, 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐶𝐶]/𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝐴𝐴]
7

One third of all state defined benefit plans whose participants are also covered by Social Security have a

Social Security leveling option. Most of these plans also use age 62 for leveling; however, some use 65
or allow the retiree to select the age for leveling (Clark et al. 2018).

7

Then the formula for the present value of the Leveling benefit is:
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 [𝐴𝐴] = 𝐵𝐵𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 ∗ 12 ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝐴𝐴] + 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 ∗ 𝐹𝐹 ∗ 12 ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝐴𝐴] − 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 ∗ 12 ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑉𝑉[𝐴𝐴, 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐶𝐶]

where SS is the monthly benefit estimate obtained from the Social Security Administration.
Returning to Table 1, the hypothetical retiree shown claimed benefits at age 60 and was
eligible for a maximum benefit of $2,000. The retiring worker reports to the retirement system
that her expected Social Security benefit at age 62 is $1,200. Using this information and the
leveling factor based on the system’s mortality experience and the assumed interest rate, the
system would calculate the benefit prior to age 62 and the benefit from age 62 through the rest of
the life of the retiree. In this example, the retiree would receive a monthly benefit of $2,996 each
month prior to age 62 and $1,796 each month beginning at age 62. Together with a Social
Security benefit of $1,200, the post-62 total retirement income is “level” at $2,996.
IV.

Theoretical Predictions Regarding Saving and Borrowing in Retirement
We offer several predictions for various individual and household characteristics that

may influence annuity choice. Individuals with higher personal discount rates place greater
value on money in the early retirement years. Thus, they are expected to favor a single life
annuity instead of a J&S annuity and among those requesting such a benefit, Social Security
Leveling should be more appealing than the maximum benefit. Given that the retiree prefers a
single life annuity, those with lower life expectancies will be more likely to choose leveling.
Between the single life annuity and J&S annuity, retirees will be more likely to choose a J&S
annuity if they have low life expectancy and are married to spouses with high life expectancy,
holding age constant. Since the retirement system prices the annuity options based on a blended
life expectancy between men and women, the leveling option is relatively more favorably priced
for men with average life expectancy than for women with average life expectancy.
8

The work history of the spouse is expected to directly influence the annuity choice. If the
spouse has been a career worker and expects to receive a pension in his or her own right, the
retiree is predicted to be less likely to request a J&S benefit since the spouse expects to receive
this benefit after the death of the retiree. Other employer-provided benefits earned by the spouse
or the retiree or purchased by the household, such as retiree health insurance, long term care
insurance, or life insurance, should also should define the optimal annuity choice. Life insurance
could be considered a substitute for J&S benefits, i.e. similar to the lower benefit required by
J&S in that individuals pay a premium for life insurance to provide funds for the beneficiary.
The predicted effect for years of service on the annuity choice is ambiguous. On the one hand,
longer tenure is generally associated with higher pension benefits, which may reduce the demand
for higher income immediately after retirement. However, shorter tenure might be related to
retirement at younger ages with the intension to pursue a second career.
As shown in Appendix Table B3, men are much more likely to choose a J&S annuity
compared to women (61 Percent compared to only 35 percent). We note that gender is highly
correlated with many of the other variables that affect annuity choice and as such, gender may
serve as a proxy for other characteristics. To the extent that the benefit level is correlated with
household finances, we expect that those with higher benefits are more likely to have alternative
sources of liquidity. Moreover, higher earners have a longer life expectancy, on average
(Galama et al. 2018). As such, they may be more willing to defer some of their pension income
by selecting one of the J&S options. Similarly, those without a college degree tend to have
lower life expectancies, so lower educated retirees may be more likely to choose leveling due to
shorter life expectancy. To the extent that race/ethnicity correlates with life expectancy, we
expect that non-Hispanic blacks are more likely to choose leveling than non-Hispanic whites.

9

Holding constant mortality expectations, personal discount rate, and the absolute level of
benefits, we find no clear prediction on the relationship between age at claiming and annuity
option choice. Note that the age of the retiree and the spouse determines the reduction in
benefits associated with a J&S annuity. Next, while individuals in poor health may have lower
life expectancies, the prediction for the relationship between poor health and annuity choice is
ambiguous (McGarry, 2014). Individuals may require additional funds for medical expenditures
if they are in poor health or may want to consume more during a period of good health.
Among those who prefer a single life annuity, risk aversion could manifest itself in a
preference for leveling if near-term consumption shocks are predominant in one’s decision
process. However, if mortality risk (i.e., dying young) is predominant, then one is likely to
prefer immediate consumption and therefore choose leveling. If instead an individual is worried
about longevity risk (i.e., outliving one’s savings), the individual is less likely to prefer leveling
so that the benefit in later years is higher. Thus, the prediction on risk preferences is ambiguous.
It is important to remember that the annuity choice is a difficult and complex decision,
which will influence well-being throughout the retirement years. Knowledge concerning the
annuity choices, how the benefits are calculated, and how they may change over time and in
response to specific events are crucially important (Chan and Stevens, 2008). However, we have
no prediction on how financial literacy might affect which annuity options is chosen.
V.

Regression Analysis of Annuity Choice
We now examine the annuity choices of recent retirees in North Carolina using a

combination of administrative and survey data. The administrative records on individuals who
first claimed pension benefits between 2009 and 2014 are from the North Carolina Retirement
Transitions Study – Benefit Claimants (NCRTS-BC) data on retirees from the North Carolina

10

Teachers’ and State Employees’ Retirement System (TSERS) and Local Governmental
Employees’ Retirement System (LGERS). These data are merged with survey responses to a
survey conducted in spring 2015 and a follow-up survey conducted in spring 2017.
The administrative records contain detailed information about each retiree including
earnings, job information, years of service, creditable service, year of retirement, annuity option
chosen, and benefit amount. The surveys gathered information about race/ethnicity, education
level, household income and wealth, work status after claiming retirement benefits, and marital
status, along with questions about their spouses’ characteristics (if applicable). In addition, the
surveys included questions on retiree well-being and satisfaction with retirement-related
decisions. 8 The first set of survey responses were received in 2015, which is one to six years
after the retiree had made their annuity choice. Thus, some answers (such as wealth and health)
may differ from those the individual might have given at the time of the retirement decision. 9
Table 2 presents summary statistics from the administrative records (Column (1)), the
first survey respondents (Column (2)), and the first survey respondents who reported being
married or living with partner (Column (3), where we refer to both groups simply as married).
The survey was sent to 27,434 individuals from the population in Column (1). Our estimation
sample includes 5,515 useable responses, which represents a survey response rate of roughly 20
percent. 10 Comparing Columns (1) and (2), our survey sample is reasonably representative of

8

Appendices B and C provide detail on the data and survey instrument.

9

See Clark, Hammond, and Vanderweide (2018) for additional details on the pattern of annuity choice

over time. The proportion of retirees choosing J&S increases over time, with a small but noticeable jump
in 2012. This is consistent with the annuity pricing changes in 2012 discussed earlier.
10

The survey is part of a larger project and covers all benefit claimants from 2009 to 2014. Our overall

response rate on the survey was 22 percent. For more detail on the larger project, please see our website:
https://sites.google.com/site/publicsectorretirement/.

11

the population of interest. Survey respondents have higher final average salary and maximum
initial benefit amounts, and they were more likely to have more than 30 years of service at
retirement.
[Table 2]
From Column (2) to (3), we restrict the sample to survey respondents who are married.
Our focus is individuals who consider both a single life and J&S annuity; for married individuals
considering a J&S annuity, their spouse represents a focal beneficiary. While unmarried
individuals do choose J&S, their rates are much lower. 11 Further, the survey data provide
information on spousal characteristics for married individuals and this information allows us to
reconstruct the annuity benefit associated with each annuity option, assuming the spouse would
have been the beneficiary. Comparing Columns (2) and (3), the restriction to married
respondents changes the sample in relatively minor ways. There are a larger proportion of males
in Column (3) and, consistent with the arguments above, a larger proportion of men choose J&S.
The first column in Table 3 reproduces the last column of Table 2, while Columns (2)-(4)
of Table 3 split the married respondent sample among the three annuity options. For all married
survey respondents in Column (1), the average retiree is around 60 years of age upon retirement.
Around 48 percent of all retirees are teachers, 19 percent are local government employees, and
18 percent are state government employees. In general, the public sector tends to be majority
female and the North Carolina data are consistent with this observation, as 66.8 percent of the
married respondents are women. 40.2 percent of married respondents retired with 30 or more
years of service, while the average final salary is $62,754.32 and the initial benefit check had the
retiree chosen the Maximum Benefit annuity option is $2,433.50 on average.

11

5.8 percent of unmarried individuals in our sample chose one of the J&S annuity options.

12

[Table 3]
Comparing Columns (2)-(4), the characteristics of those choosing the three annuity
options are quite different along several dimensions. Those choosing leveling tended to be
younger at retirement (which is intuitive because leveling is only possible for those retiring under
62), had lower salaries, and had more years of service. Those choosing J&S tended to have
higher salaries and were eligible for more from the retirement system in the form of higher
benefits had they chosen the maximum benefit. A meaningfully higher proportion of men chose
a J&S annuity relative to women. These are univariate differences along correlated dimensions,
so now we conduct a regression analysis to explore ceteris paribus associations.
Our main regression analysis is estimated using data from married respondents to the first
survey, as shown in Column (1), Table 3. As mentioned above, we include individuals who
reported that they are married or living with partner and simply say married. The survey of
retirees provides us with the opportunity to examine the annuity choice process utilizing personal
information that is not available in the administrative records. Tables 4 and 5 present regression
estimates from a nested logit regression model (McFadden, 1981). 12 A nested logit model is a
generalized multinomial logit model with less restrictive assumptions regarding the
independence of the error terms affecting choice among each annuity option. Choice is nested
and the error terms for options in the same nest can be correlated. In our setting, there are two
nests: the single life nest includes the Maximum Benefit and Social Security Leveling, while the
J&S nest includes the four J&S options (two 100 percent and two 50 percent J&S options).

12

In addition to the covariates shown in the table, the regression also includes an indicator for having

multiple benefit accounts and controls for five agency categories and for the year of benefit claiming.

13

Our nested logit regression analysis in Table 4 shows estimates at the “top level” of the
nesting structure, thus the coefficients reflect the effects of observable characteristics on the
choice of J&S, with single life as the baseline. An alternative is a multinomial logit regression
model; we show nested logit results because specification tests favor our nested logit regression
model over this alternative. 13 Clark et al. (2018) provide an analysis of the choice of leveling,
among individuals who chose a single life annuity. Table 4 displays regression results and
marginal effects. Column (1) includes the baseline covariates, while Column (2) adds spousal
characteristics. The results are similar in both columns, so we focus on Column (2).
[Table 4]
The first covariate is the only alternative-specific covariate in the model (i.e., varies
across individuals and annuity options), which ensures identification of the nested logit model.
In our setting, this is the annuity factor, defined as the ratio of the net present value of the
annuity option relative to the net present value of the maximum benefit. 14 The factor coefficient
is not our focus, and its positive coefficient simply says that a higher present value is preferred.
We simply control for the annuity factor to ask how observable characteristics affect annuity
choice.
Men are more likely to choose J&S, with a large effect size of 14.3 percentage points.
This is consistent with the fact that men have shorter life expectancies, on average, which
implies that the survivor benefit is valued more by men than women. We explore gender more in
the next table. Non-Hispanic black retirees choose J&S at a 10.4 percentage point lower rate.

13

Results from multinomial logit regression models are presented in Appendix Table B4.

14

The present value calculation uses survival probabilities from the retirement system and discount

factors equal to the 20-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate at the beginning of the claiming year.

14

Later age at claiming lowers the propensity to choose J&S, an effect of around 0.5 percentage
point for five years older at claiming. We account for spousal age by constructing two age
difference variables, the number of years the retiree is older if the difference is positive and
separately the number of years younger if negative. Larger age gaps among spouses are
associated with less choice of J&S, with 1.5 percentage points per year of difference if positive
and 0.6 percentage points per year of difference if negative. The negative effect of age
difference for retirees who are younger than their spouse might reflect the fact that the survivor
benefit is less valuable to a retiree who is much younger. As shown in Table 1, younger spouses
are associated with a lower J&S benefit, relative to maximum benefit, which probably explains
the effect of positive age difference.
Next, reporting being in good health is associated with a 10.3 percentage point lower rate
of choosing J&S; reported spousal good health also lowers J&S choice, but neither the level
effect nor the interaction with spousal health is statistically significant. A retiree’s perception of
their life expectancy and his or her perception of their spouse’s life expectancy both have the
expected effect (while the interaction is not significant). Expecting a long life is associated with
6.7 percentage point lower rate of J&S choice, while expecting one’s spouse to live a long life is
associated with 8.7 percentage point higher rate of J&S choice. The survey also asked retirees
whether they and/or their spouse had life insurance (LI) and long-term care insurance (LTCI) as
well as whether their spouse had access to a pension from their current or previous employer
(either currently receiving pension benefits or eligible to receive in the future).
While life insurance is not associated with J&S annuity choice, having purchased longterm care insurance has a strong effect. Retirees with long-term care insurance are 7.0
percentage points less likely to have chosen J&S, which suggests that these two products are

15

substitutes. There is an effect of spousal long-term care insurance, but it interacts with the
covariate for both retiree and spouse having long-term care insurance. Spousal pension also
affects J&S choice: retirees whose spouse has their own pension are 2.6 percentage points less
likely to choose J&S. Years of service has a monotonic effect, such that those retiring with less
service are less likely to choose J&S. Each $1,000 additional in a retiree’s initial benefit amount
is associated with 5.4 percentage points higher rate of J&S choice.
Finally, the measures of financial literacy and preferences toward risk and time are
elicited from the survey. 15 High levels of objective financial literacy (as measured by answering
both questions correctly) are associated with a choice of J&S at a rate that is 5.4 percentage
points higher relative to a single life annuity. Time preferences affect J&S annuity choice as
expected. Those who are measured as impatient on the lottery frame only and on lottery and
benefit frames have 3.4 and 3.7 percentage points lower rates of J&S choice respectively. Risk
preferences reveal one statistically significant association, where those who are measured as
being risk averse on the pension frame chose J&S at a rate that is 12.7 percentage points lower.
However, the risk results on the lottery prize frame and from retirees who answered consistently
across both frames are opposite signed relative to the pension results. This suggests that the
framing of our pension question, rather than risk preferences per se, may be at work here.
Next, we explicitly examine gender by presenting results for men and women separately.
Table 5 estimates the baseline specification of Table 4 separately by gender. The results in Table
5 are similar to the aggregate results. Several coefficients are more precisely estimated for

15

The wording of these questions is included in Appendix C. We have two questions respectively for

eliciting risk and time preferences: one question asks respondents to choose between pension benefits and
one asks respondents to choose between lottery prizes.

16

women, which may be driven by our larger female sample; notably, the negative effect of long
life expectancy is driven entirely by women. Our main goal in separate gender estimation is to
decompose the difference in J&S choice into observable differences among men and women.
[Table 5]
In our sample of married public sector workers, 61.3 percent of men and 34.7 percent of
women choose a J&S annuity, a 26.6 percentage point difference. (See Appendix Table B3.) Is
this difference explained by observable characteristics that differ by gender? From Table 4, the
predicted probability of choosing J&S (holding all covariates at their sample means) is 53.6
percent for men and 39.0 percent for women, a 14.5 percentage point difference. If the women
in our sample had observable characteristics that took the same values as our men, then the
predicted probability of choosing J&S would be 41.4 percent for women. Relative to the
predicted probability reported above of 53.6 percent for men, the difference is 12.2 percentage
points. In total, we can explain more than half of the gender difference in J&S choice by
observable characteristics. The remaining gender difference represents the residual gender
effect.
We place our public sector workers in context using private sector workers in the Health
and Retirement Study (HRS) 2014 wave. Note that the sample of public sector workers in the
HRS is very small, which emphasizes the importance of new data such as ours for this segment
of the workforce. Restricting to married private sector workers in the HRS, 75.8 percent of men
and 49.4 percent of women choose a J&S annuity. 16 Thus, both males and females in our sample

16

Johnson et al. (2005) examine earlier HRS waves and also report substantial gender differences in the

choice of J&S. They find that 72 percent of men and 31 percent of women choose J&S. The lower rate
they find for women may be driven by their earlier data or by our sample restrictions.

17

choose J&S annuities at rates that are more than 10 percentage points lower than private sector
workers in the HRS. 17 Overall, 43.6 percent of our sample chooses a J&S annuity, while 66.9
percent of married private sector workers in the HRS choose J&S, where the overall gap between
J&S choice in our sample and J&S choice in the HRS is wider due to the larger proportion of
women among our public sector workers.
In total, we find that retirees choose among annuity options in ways that are consistent
with predictions over which individuals might benefit from each annuity option. J&S is more
likely to be chosen by individuals for whom survivor motives are more salient (e.g., those with
lower life expectancies such as males, those with low subjective life expectancy, and those
whose spouse does not have alternative sources of retirement incomes such as a pension or longterm care insurance). Leveling is more likely to be chosen by individuals whose near-term
retirement income needs are more salient (e.g., those with low subjective life expectancy and
those whose time preferences are consistent with impatience). To study retirement outcomes for
individuals who chose different annuities, we now analyze self-reported retirement well-being.
VI.

Well-being in Retirement
Is the choice of annuity an important determinant of well-being in retirement? Our

surveys of retirees provide information on several measures of well-being in retirement, which
we group into two sets of measures. The information measures are retirees’ satisfaction with
their retirement choices and the information available upon annuity choice. The income security
measures are retirees’ satisfaction with their standard of living, belief that they saved enough,

17

Myers et al. (1987) and Kotlikoff and Smith (1983) study J&S choice in the pre-ERISA years. They

find that J&S choice rates were lower before the ERISA default of a 50 percent J&S annuity. Holden and
Nicholson (1998) and Aura (2005) study the post-ERISA period and find higher rates of J&S choice.

18

and confidence in not outliving their savings. Each measure takes a positive value when the
individual “agrees” or “strongly agrees” with the statements. 18
Table 6 presents means along each dimension of information and income security, shown
separately using responses to the first survey in 2015 and from the follow-up survey in 2017
(S2015 and S2017, respectively). The sample in this, and the subsequent tables, is married
individuals who claimed benefits between 2009 and 2014 who responded to both surveys. 19
First, we focus on the initial responses in 2015 and then turn to the follow-up responses in 2017.
Among all married individuals in the first survey, we observe high rates of agreement with
having made the best decisions regarding annuity choice and having had enough information
upon retirement (both rates are over 90 percent). For income security, 82.6 percent of
respondents are satisfied with their standard of living in retirement, while only 62.3 percent of
respondents believe they saved enough and 69.5 percent are confident in not outliving their
savings. Overall, we interpret these figures as being consistent with high rates of well-being in
retirement but with magnitudes that vary with the framing of the question.
[Table 6]
Individuals report lower levels of satisfaction with information and income security, on
average, two years after the original survey. Table 7 presents additional information on changes
between the two surveys, but it is clear that the means are lower in 2017 along every dimension.
Comparing responses across individuals who chose different annuity options, J&S annuitants are

18

The wording of these questions is included in Appendix C. Results are similar using only “strongly

agree” as the well-being measure.
19

Appendix Table B5 presents a comparison between the estimation sample in Tables 6-8 (those who

responded to both the initial and the follow-up surveys) and estimation sample in Tables 4-5 (those who
responded to the initial survey).

19

similar to maximum benefit annuitants with the exception of satisfaction with annuity choice,
where J&S is associated with 2.9 percentage points higher satisfaction. Relative to J&S or
maximum benefit, leveling is associated with less satisfaction in terms of information and
income security. Those who chose leveling are particularly unlikely to report belief in having
saved enough and unlikely to report having confidence in not outliving their savings.
Table 7 reports the proportion of individuals who increased or decreased along each
dimension from the original survey to the follow-up survey. The statistical test results shown in
Panel A are from tests of whether changes are equally likely to be increases and decreases. For
each cell, decreases are statistically significantly more likely than increases. Thus, perceived
retirement well-being decreases for these individuals. Panel B compares measures across
annuity options, where the statistical test results are from tests of whether the proportion of
individuals reporting less satisfaction is different across annuity options.
[Table 7]
Relative to maximum benefit, individuals who chose J&S are similar with the exception
of belief in having saved enough, where J&S is associated with a larger decrease in satisfaction
(5.0 percentage points). Relative to maximum benefit, for individuals who chose leveling, the
decrease between the two surveys is statistically significantly larger for leveling in terms of
having made the best annuity choice decision, satisfaction with standard of living, and
confidence in not outliving their savings. Overall, we find small differences among maximum
and J&S annuitants, but large differences between leveling annuitants and others. Those
choosing leveling are less satisfied and more likely to report lower satisfaction over time. This

20

result should not be surprising since many of those that selected leveling will have reached age
62 and would have had their pension benefit reduced by the specified formula. 20
Finally, Table 8 presents a regression analysis of these five measures using the responses
to the follow-up survey in 2017, which is three to eight years after the claiming decision for these
retirees. Using the follow-up survey responses allows us to measure retirement well-being
several years into retirement. Each column presents the results from a linear probability model.
J&S is similar to maximum benefit on some measures, but J&S is associated with less
satisfaction with their standard of living in retirement (6.7 percentage points) and less belief in
having saved enough (6.8 percentage points). Consistent with the comparison of means, leveling
is generally associated with less satisfaction than maximum benefit: 4.8 percentage points less
satisfied with annuity choice decision, 12.6 percentage points less satisfied with having saved
enough, and 12.6 percentage points less confident about not outliving their savings. In total,
leveling is associated with less perceived well-being in retirement, with large effect sizes.
[Table 8]
The other covariates in Table 8 provide additional insights regarding the characteristics
associated with well-being in retirement. Males are much more confident in not outliving their
savings than females, but they do not believe they saved enough at higher rates and are not more
satisfied with their standard of retirement living. Non-Hispanic black retirees report less
satisfaction along all dimensions, with large effect sizes. Individuals with at least a BA degree
report more satisfaction, as do those who claimed at older ages. Interestingly, those with higher

20

The retirement system reports that they receive calls from many retirees who selected leveling who

seem surprised that their monthly pension benefit has been reduced. Perhaps due to this reaction, a bill
was introduced in the 2018 legislative session to eliminate this option (HB 1055). The bill has not
become law during the 2018 session of the North Carolina General Assembly.

21

initial benefit checks report more satisfaction with their well-being in terms of income security,
but they are no more likely to report satisfaction in terms of information/decision quality.
The results in Table 8 do not provide causal interpretations because these covariates are
correlated with a host of unobserved factors that limit precise interpretations. However,
controlling for these observed factors, we find that individuals who chose different annuities
upon retirement report different levels of satisfaction in retirement. J&S annuitants are
somewhat less satisfied than maximum benefit annuitants in terms of income security (standard
of living and saved enough). Leveling annuitants are less satisfied than maximum benefit
annuitants in all five measures, with statistically significant differences for three measures.
VII.

Conclusions

Using combined administrative records and survey data, we analyze how individuals choose
among annuity options at retirement. Several findings are particularly relevant to policymakers.
First, only 44 percent of North Carolina public sector retirees select a J&S annuity. This is much
lower than the rate of 67 percent that we document among private sector workers in the Health
and Retirement Study (HRS). Some portion of the difference between our finding and those
from the HRS may be due to differences among the private sector workers in the HRS and our
public sector workers. However, we conjecture that there is an important role played by ERISA
regulations for a J&S default annuity, which does not cover the plans we study.
Second, as has been found previously, males are much more likely than females to choose a
J&S annuity. Our regression analysis controls for a large set of individual and household
characteristics and holding these constant, the results suggest that men value survivor benefits
more than women. Men are also more likely to choose J&S when their spouse does not have
access to a pension of their own, while a spouse’s pension plays a less important role for women

22

in the choice of annuity. We decompose the gap between men and women in the choice of a
J&S annuity; observable characteristics explain more than half of the gender difference, but a
sizeable gap remains. Annuity choice appears to be a household decision that involves
bargaining between household members in ways that are consistent with predictions over which
households might benefit most from each annuity option.
Our final analysis exploits the panel nature of our survey data to track self-reported wellbeing several years into retirement. Retirees who made different annuity choices report very
different levels of well-being in retirement and changes in well-being also differ markedly. The
Social Security Leveling annuity option (which provides a level retirement income before and
after age 62) is associated with substantially less retirement income security, relative to the
Maximum Benefit or a J&S annuity. J&S annuitants are relatively similar in their self-reported
well-being with respect to those who chose the Maximum Benefit, but there is some evidence
that the Maximum Benefit is associated with slightly higher levels of retirement income security.
In total, the annuity an individual chooses matters a lot for their outcomes in retirement.

Appendix A: Sample construction and restrictions
1. Administrative Records
The retirement system maintains records for several retirement plans including
firefighters, judicial classes, and the legislature. We construct our data using administrative
records on active retirement benefit accounts that were initiated between January 1, 2009 and
December 31, 2014. We only consider retirement accounts from the TSERS or LGERS
retirement systems. We exclude any accounts that are suspended. We do not include ancillary
accounts from other systems but do retain an indicator if the individual has other benefit
accounts, which might include the transfer benefit option or another retirement system such as
the legislature or firefighters. 21 We also exclude any accounts that were closed for any reason,
including disability, withdrawal, or transfer of benefits. We exclude firefighters and law
enforcement officers that are within TSERS and LGERS, since the eligibility rules are different
for those plans.
We confirm that the remaining 80,241 benefit records are unique accounts – individuals
may only receive one benefit from TSERS and one benefit from LGERS. We make further
exclusions as listed in Appendix Table B1 below. These include: recorded years of service is
less than 5 years, termination of employment before 2008, days between termination and
claiming greater than one year, and missing gender code. We end up with 72,350 unique benefit
accounts representing 72,254 individuals with one account and 96 individuals with both a
TSERS and LGERS account.
We sent a survey to 27,434 of the eligible benefit claimants. Our final sample for
analysis includes 5,515 respondents for a response rate of 20%.
Appendix Table B2 presents a comparison between our sample and data from the
American Community Survey (ACS). For the ACS data, we used the 2012-2016 5-year Public
Use Microdata Samples (PUMS). We include individuals aged 50 or older. We consider those

21

While we focus solely on those accounts in TSERS and LGERS, individuals may also have accounts

with these other systems. Where relevant, we include an indicator variable for the individual having an
additional membership in another retirement plan. About 1 percent of our sample has both an active
TSERS and LGERS retirement benefit. For those individuals we keep both records and treat them as
separate observations but retain an indicator variable.

Appendix Page 1

who were state or local government employees and worked full time (14+ weeks and 30+ hours
per week worked). The sample is then restricted to those that did not work last week, that last
worked within the past 12 months, and that are currently either unemployed or not in the labor
force. This approximates recent retirees. Our ACS data will exclude individuals that claimed
benefits from a public sector retirement system but immediately took another job.

2. Key Policy Details
Here we outline some key policies that were in place during the 2009-2014 time period.

Return to work:
Our data will include some individuals that have “retired” but are still working within the system
according to the rules below.
o

Pension benefits can be received while working at any other job not covered by
that pension. This includes a TSERS employee working under LGERS and vice
versa.

o

Pension benefits can be received while working for a job at the prior employer as
long as the position is not eligible for pension benefits (typically a part-time
position).

o

Pension benefits will be suspended if an individual works in a job that is covered
by the same pension. After 3 years of service, the earned benefits can be
combined into one account. If 3 years of service are not reached, the new account
is not eligible for pension benefits and must be withdrawn as a lump sum.

Multiple benefit accounts:
We retain individuals that have multiple benefit accounts and include TSERS and LGERS
accounts separately in the data. The rules on maintaining multiple benefit accounts are below.
o

Each retirement benefit account can be paid separately and there are no
restrictions on coordinating annuity type or timing. Individuals with multiple
accounts have the option to consolidate them by transferring service from one
account to another. The average final compensation (AFC) used is that from the
receiving account, while the years of service is the sum of all accounts. We
Appendix Page 2

cannot track in the data whether the benefit account is the sum of multiple
benefits earned under different retirement systems.
o

An individual may have multiple membership accounts due to:


Long break in work



Return to work



Work with a different retirement system (first TSERS, then LGERS etc.)

Years of Service:
In our data, we only observe creditable service, which is a combination of tenure and optional
purchased service.
o

Creditable service: service calculation used for determining benefit level


Membership service



Purchased service: withdrawn service, military service, out-of-state,
temporary, educational leave, workers’ compensation, community service,
parental leave, extended illness leave, etc. Also, unused sick leave and
vacation time.

o

Contributory service: service calculation used for determining eligibility

Using date of hire and date of termination, which are measured with some error, we estimate that
most individuals have about 6-8 months of purchased service on top of membership service.

unemployed or not in the labor force. Data from our survey include married individuals that claimed
retirement benefits in North Carolina. Survey respondents are disproportionally higher educated than the
population average.

Appendix C: Definition of Key Survey Variables
Risk and Time Preferences
Impatient: Lottery Frame
Suppose that you won a prize that is worth $1000 if you take it today. Alternatively, you could
wait one year to claim the prize and be guaranteed to receive $1200. Would you claim the $1000
dollars today, or would you wait one year for the $1200?
� Claim $1000 today
� Wait one year and claim $1200
� Not sure
Impatient: Benefit Frame
Imagine you are 65 years old, and you (and your spouse/partner) are receiving $1000 per month
in Social Security benefits. Suppose you were given the choice to reduce that benefit by half, to
$500 per month. This one-half benefit reduction would continue for as long as you (and your
spouse/partner) live. In return, you would be given a one-time, lump-sum payment of $80,500.
Would you take the $1000 monthly benefit for life, or the reduced monthly benefit combined
with the lump sum payment?
� Take the $1000 monthly benefit
� Take the reduced benefit and the lump sum
� Not sure
Risk Adverse: Pension Frame
Suppose that you are about to retire and have two choices for your pension benefit. Pension A
gives you an income equal to your pre-retirement income. Pension B has a 50% chance of
providing a benefit worth double your pre-retirement income and a 50% chance of providing a
benefit worth 20% less than your pre-retirement income. Which pension benefit would you
choose?
� Pension A
� Pension B
� Not sure

Appendix Page 10

Risk Adverse: Prize Frame
Suppose that you are offered a choice between two prizes. If you choose Prize A, you are
guaranteed to receive $1000. Alternatively, if you choose prize B, you will have a 50-50 chance
of receiving $2200 and a 50-50 chance of receiving $0. Which prize would you choose -- Prize
A or Prize B?
� Prize A
� Prize B
� Not sure

Financial Knowledge
Financial Knowledge: Compounding
If you have $100 in your savings account, and the annual interest rate is 2%, how much money will
you have in your account after five years?

� More than $102

� $102

� Less than $102

� Do not Know

Financial Knowledge: Inflation
If the current interest rate on your savings account is 1% per year, and the inflation rate is 2% per
year, how much do you think you will be able to buy with your money a year from now?

�
�
�
�

A larger amount than you can buy now
Exactly the same amount as you can buy now
A smaller amount than you can buy now
Do not know

Self-Reported Financial Knowledge:
On a scale from 1 to 7 (where 1 means very low, and 7 means very high), how would you rate your
financial knowledge?

Appendix Page 11

Well-Being Outcomes:
The five retiree well-being outcomes in Table 6-8 of the text are derived from the following
questions. The outcome is binary with a 1 for “agree” or “strongly agree” and 0 otherwise.
Results are similar when the outcome is alternatively “strongly agree” only.
Please indicate whether you agree or disagree with the following statements regarding your
retirement [Strong Disagree; Disagree; Neither Agree nor Disagree; Agree; Strongly
Agree; Not Applicable/ Don’t know]:
“Best decisions”: I made the best possible decisions concerning the payment option for my
TSERS/LGERS pension benefit.
“Enough info”: I had enough information to make the best possible decisions regarding my
retirement.
“Satisfied”: I am satisfied with the standard of living I have had since I first started receiving a
pension check.
“Saved enough”: I saved enough for retirement while working.
“Confident”: I am confident that I will not outlive my savings.
