PRICE INDEXES FOR MICROCOMPUTERS: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY

ABSTRACT

In this paper we focus on alternative procedures for calculating and
interpreting quality-adjusted price indexes for microcomputers, based on a
variety of estimated hedonic price equations. Our data set comprises an
unbalanced panel for 1265 model observations from 1982 to 1988, and includes
both list and discount prices. We develop and implement empirically a
specification test for selecting preferable hedonic price equations, and
consider in detail the alternative interpretations of dununy variable
coefficients having time and age, vintage and age, and all of the time, age,
and vintage dummy variables as regressors.
We then calculate a variety of quality-adjusted price indexes; for the
Divisja indexes we employ estimated hedonic price equations to predict
prices of unobserved models (pre-entry and post-exit). Although our indexes
show a modest amount of variation, we find that on average over the 1982-88
time period in the US, quality-adjusted real prices for microcomputers
decline at about 28% per year.

I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, a considerable amount of research has focussed on the

construction snd interpretation of price indexes for computers) The computer
market is a fascinating one, for technological change has been rapid, there

has been a great deal of entry and exit of fins and models, and particularly
in the microcomputer market, models have been simultaneously sold at different
prices by standard retail and discount vendors.
Because of the rapid technological change and turnover of models and

fins, Franklin M. Fisher et al. [1983] have characterized the mainframe
computer market as typically being in "disequilibrium". One consequence of
this is that price indexes have been used for two rather different purposes.
one to deflate expenditures or purchases into constant dollars, and the other
to trace out movements in a technological frontier, such as a priceperformance ratio.
If quality-adjusted prices reacted instantaneously and fully to the
introduction of new technology, then an index that traced out the
technological frontier would be identical to one that covered all models sold

in the marketplace. In periods of disequilibrium, however, the two qualityadjusted price indexes might differ, with consumers tolerating transactions at

more than one quality-adjusted price. Reasons for such multiple price
transactions include the fact that the supply of some new models might
initially be limited, and that in spite of this excess demand, manufacturers
may offer new models at lower prices to facilitate dissemination of

information about the impact of the new low-price technology. Alternatively,
surviving models may be of higher quality in some unobserved characteristics,

may benefit from the accumulation of specialized software and knowhow. The

extent of such price disequilibrium is of course an empirical issue; some
recent evidence on this issue for the mainframe computer market is presented
by Ellen Oulberger [1989].
Although the mainframe computer market has received considerable
attention, to the best of our knowledge there has been little empirical work

on the microcomputer or PC market.2 In this paper we focus attention on the
interpretation of implicit price indexes and coefficients from hedonic price
equations using detailed data from the retail and discount US microcomputer

(PC) markets.3 Our work builds on the research of two of our students, Jeremy
Cohen [1988] and Amy Kim [1989]. Cohen originally gathered and assembled
price and characteristics data covering the 1976-1987 time period; the data he
updated to include 1988 were then examined further by Kim.

Eased on hedonic regression equations with pooled data, both Cohen and
Kim generated implicit PC price indexes for retail (list) and discount

markets. Representative findings from Cohen and Kim are presented in Table 1
below, as are the PC price indexes computed by Robert J. Gdrdon [1990] based
on 21 PC model-years and the "matched model" index number procedure, and the
BEA "official" PC price index.4
As is seen in Table 1, all indexes suggest rapid declines in the

quality-adjusted price of microcomputers. Cohen reports an average annual

growth rate (AACR) of -25.36% in the Ai (CPI adjusted) price of PC's over
the 1976-87 time frame for list prices, and a slightly lower -21.33% for

discount prices. Kim finds an AACR of -29.48% for reel list prices 1976-88,
and -23.53% for real discount prices. Gordon's calculations suggest an AACR

Notes: Data are taken from Cohen [1988], Appendix D, p. 70 (reriormalized to
1982 — 1.000); from Kim [1989], Appendix 22; and from Cordon [1990], Table
6.13, p. 237 (renormalized). The BEA Index is from the November 1988 issue
of the Survey of Current Business. Gordon's index is based on data covering
21 model-years observed over the 1981-87 time period in advertisements in
Business Week and PC Magazine. The real price indexes are computed as the
nominal price index divided by the Consumer Price Index (the CPI is in the
last column).

of -26.12% for the shorter 1982-87 time period (a mix of list and discount
prices), while the SEA real price index falls at an AAGR of -25.08% for the
same time period.

To facilitate comparison of indexes, in the bottom row of Table 1 we
present AACR for all the real and nominal price indexes over the same 1982-87

time interval. Note that the BEA and Gordon price indexes based on matched

MICROCOMPUTER PRICES

model procedures show a less rapid decline over this interval than do the
hedonic regression indexes constructed by Cohen and Kim.

The research results we report in this paper extend the work of Cohen

Kim and Gordon in a number of related ways. First, we focus attention on the
more general interpretive implications of the fact that the PC market is a
changing one during the 1982-88 time period, involving shake-outs of some
models, successful innovations for others, and dramatic changes in product

characteristics. The data sample we observe is opportunistic in the sense
that it represents only new and surviving vintages. We examine whether
surviving vintages are priced at a premium, and how prices of surviving
vintages adjust when new models are introduced incorporating technological
advances.

Second, we examine several econometric implications of the fact that our
data are in the form of an unbalanced panel, due to differential survival

rates in the marketplace. In particular, we explore implications for
estimation of how one implements empirically the identity that the year in
which the model is observed is the sum of the year in which the model was

first introduced and its age in years. A diagnostic test is discussed and
implemented for checking our hedonic specification. Issues of sample
selectivity are also addressed.

Finally, we construct and comment on a variety of price indexes that
attempt in various ways to serve as deflators, or as measures that trace out a
technological frontier in the PC market.

II. THE DATA
The data set available for this study includes price and technical
attribute measures for new (not used) personal computers sold in the US from

1976 to 1988. The 1976-1987 data were originally collected and analyzed by

MICROCOMPUTER PRICES

Page 5

Jeremy Cohen [1988]; these data have been updated by Cohen to 1988, they have
been employed by Amy Kim [1989] in further analysis, and have undergone

additional revisions by us. The primary source of technical data was the
magazine comprehensive technical reviews. Since both list and discount prices
often varied within each calendar year, the June issues of

PC Magazine,

and PC World were employed for list price data, while ads in the Science and
Technology, and Business Sections of a Sunday New York Times issue in early

June of each year were employed to obtain discount prices.5 Additional data
sources included the Dataauest Personal Comouter Guide, and IBM pricing and
technical data.

Characteristic and performance data collected by Cohen include RAM (the
amount of random access memory standard on each PC model, measured in
kilobytes), MHZ (the clock speed, measured in megahertz, or millions of cycles
per second), HRDDSK (the amount of storage on the hard disk, if one exists,
measured in megabytes), NUMFLP (the number of floppy disk drives standard on
each model), SLOTS (the total number of eight, sixteen and thirty-two bit
slots available for expansion boards), and ACE (the number of years the model
has been sold on the market, where the model has an age of zero in its initial
year).

As we noted earlier, an important feature of the PC market is that it is

changing very rapidly. A model introduced in year zero may survive with
unchanged characteristics into year one, two, or even longer, or, as is often
the case, it may survive with differing characteristics into other years (we

call this a changed version of the model). Other models may exit after being
in the market only one year. Hence the stock of models sold in any given year
consists of new and incumbent models, and among the incumbent models, new and
old versions.

To highlight the evolution of the PC market, in Table 2 we present
arithmetic means of characteristics for models newly introduced from 1982
through 1988. As is seen there, the mean nominal price decreased slightly,
about 3% from $3617.61 in 1982 to $3508.47 in 1988, while mean RAM increased
more than tenfold from 94.92 to 1069.39 1(8, MHZ clock speed jumped more than

three times from 4.4046 to 14.8201, and the mean hard disk storage rose from 0
to 43.638 MB.

Note: N is the number of new models by year. Other variables are defined in
the text.

Although newly introduced models constitute a major portion of our PC data
base (722 of the 1265 models are new), some models last several years, and of
these incumbent models, some evolve into different versions with altered

characteristics. Other models exit, leaving the marketplace after less than one
year. In Table 3 we summarize the mixed nature of the PC market from 1982 to
1988, including new and up to age 3 models, separately for the total, retail and

discount markets. For the total market, 58X (722 of 1265) are new models, 29%
(372) models survived one year (perhaps with changed characteristics and reduced
prices to meet the market competition from frontier models), 10% (129) survived
two

years,

and 3% (42) remained in the market place for three years.

MICROCOMPUTER PRICES

Altogether,

-

Page 8 -

about 72% of our model observations are taken from the retail

(list price) market, while 28% represent discount (much of it mail order)

quotations.6 However, as is also seen in Table 3, the age composition of models
varies considerably between the retail and discount markets. Specifically,
discount markets tend to have a much smaller proportion of new models, and much

larger proportions of age 1, 2 and 3 year-old models. Finally, it is worth
noting that in our data set, some models are sold in both the retail and discount
markets (e.g. ,

IBM and Compaq) and are therefore "observed" twice, while others

are only in the retail market (e.g., PC Limited); however, no model ia observed
only in the discount market.
To focus attention on issues involved in interpreting coefficients with
unbalanced panels, in this paper we adopt in essence the regressors and
functional form employed by Cohen and Kim, in which the logarithm of the real
price (1.RPRICE) is regressed on the logarithm of aeveral characteristica

including LRAM, LXHZ, LHRDDSK (log (HRDDSK +
LSLOTS (log(SLOTS +

U),

1)),

LNIJMFLP (log(NUMFLP +

U),

and a number of dummy variablea.

The dummy variables for characteristics include PROC16 (—1 if model has a
16-bit processor chip, else zero), PROC32 (—1 if model has a 32-bit proceasor
chip), DBW (—1 if system comes with a monochrome monitor), DCOLOR (—1 if system
comes with a color monitor), DPORT (—1 if model is portable or convertible),

DEXTRA (—1 if model haa a significant piece of additional hardware included, else
zero. Examples of such extra hardware include modema, printers or an extra
monitor), and DDISC (—1 if system price is discounted by the vendor).
The dummy variables for manufacturers are DIBM (—1 if system is made by
IBM), DAPPLE (Apple), DCOMMO (Commodore), DCMPQ (Compaq), DNEC (NEC), DRDIOSH
(Radio Shack), DPCLIM (PC Limited), and DOTHER (made or sold by any other company
than those noted above).

MICROCOMPUTER PRICES

Finally,

-

Page 9 -

a number of time and vintage effect dummy variables are employed.

For time effects, the dummy variables T82, T83

188, take on the value of one

if the PC model was sold in that year, and else equal zero. For vintage effects,
the dummy variables V79, V80

V88 take on the value one if the model was

originally introduced in that year, and else equal zero.

The above variables, as well as several other measures, were included as
regressors in a number of specifications examined by Cohen and by Kim using data
beginning in 1976.

Since the PC market was very small from 1976 until the entry

of IBM in late 1981 (only 156 models were introduced before 1982), in this paper
we confine our attention to the 1982-1988 time period and the 1979-88 vintages,
restricting our sample to PC models whose age is three years or less, and
dividing the ACE variable into three dummy variables, ACE1, ACE2 and AGE3, with a

new model having an implicit age of zero. The data used in our regression
analysis is summarized in Table 4, where we present sample means as well as
minimum and maximum values of the various variables.

III. ECONOMETRIC ISSUES
Our data set comes in the form of an unbalanced panel, in that the number

of observations by age, and by vintage, varies by year. Let the vintage of model
i (the year in which it was first introduced) be V, where V — V79,V8O

V88,

let the year (time period) in which the model is observed be T, where T — 182,

183

188, and let the age of the model of vintage V observed in time period T,

in years, be A, where A — AO,Al,A2 and A3. This yields the identity that for any
model -observation,

TIME—VINTAGE+ACE, or T—V+A.

If T, V and A were continuous variables indexed by year, one could not
simultaneously introduce all three as regressors in a linear equation to be
estimated by least squares, for exact collinearity would result; to avoid such
collinearity, only two of the three could be included directly, and estimates for

the third could be computed indirectly using (1). Alternatively, as has been
discussed by Stephen Fienberg and William Mason [1985] ,

one could specify a model

MICROCOMPUTER PRICES

with

-

Page 11 -

nonlinear transformations of all three variables, such as their squared

values.7

However, when T, V and A are discrete dummy variables rather than
continuous, and if the coefficients of these variables are to be held Constant
over time and/or vintage, then the simple adding-up conditions implied by (1) no

longer hold. This raises a number of issues involving the interpretation of
dummy variable coefficients, and the maximal parameterization possible that
avoids exact collinearity.8
Suppose one specified an equation having, in addition to an overall
constant and a number of model i-specific characteristic variables (called X's),
the time and age dummy variables (but not the vintage dummies),

In ivat — a +

T'a + A'aa +

X'fl

+

uivat,

(2)

where the T82 and AO dummy variables were deleted. In this case one might
interpret estimates of the at as changes in the quality-adjusted price index

relative to 1982, holding age fixed. Similarly, estimates of the 0a can be
interpreted as the effects of age (relative to a new model of age zero) on price,

holding time fixed. Intuitively, the at parameters in this T-A specification
represent the general movement in average PC prices, given the average rate at
which selectivity occurs in the sample.
While cumulated evidence from the mainframe market suggests that the at
should decline with time,9 it is not clear what one should expect for signs of
the estimated aa, which represent the effects of quality differentials on models

of different ages sold contemporaneously, holding time fixed. According to one
line of thinking, new models of superior quality should command a premium price,
and if market competition forced the valuations of characteristics of incumbent
models to obsolesce at the same rate, prices of surviving vintages would decline
appropriately, and since the time dummy captures the full price effect, one might

expect estimates of a1, a2 and a3 to be approximately zero. On the other hand,

MICROCOMPUTER PRICES

selectivity

-

Page 12 -

in the marketplace reveals survival of the fittest, and if there are

unmeasured characteristics (e.g. ,

compatible software or hardware, differential

service policies and warranties), then the age coefficients may to some extent be
providing an eatimate of the unobserved positive quality differentials among the

survivors as vintages progress. To unscramble the obsolescence and selectivity
components of the estimated age coefficients, one would need to assume that all
of the quality differences among vintages were already captured in the changing
computer characteristics and their associated coefficients, assuring thereby that
age coefficients reflected selectivity alone.

Alternatively, one might specify a regression equation using the vintage V
and age A dummy variables, rather than the T and A as in (2),
ln "ivat —

a + V'% + A'Ca + X'fi + uivat,

where, say, the V82 vintage dummy variable was omitted. In terms of interpretation, note that if the technical characteristic variables captured virtually all
of the quality changes embodied in models, then the vintage coefficients would
essentially be capturing the average decline in prices by vintage, which in turn
is some average of the difference between A and the implicit T over ages.
Similarly, given that the specification (3) conditions on vintages, one can
interpret the tma age coefficients as representing some average of implicit time

coefficients, since by the identity (1), A • T

-

V for all vintages.

In spite of its apparent similarity with (2) given the identity (1), the
specification in (3) is in fact quite different, except for the special case when

models of only one age are considered (e.g., only AGE—O models). There are
several reasons for this. First, the number of dummy variable coefficients is
greater in (3) than in (2), for in (2) there are six time (T83-T88) and three age
(Al-A3) coefficients, while in (3) there are nine vintage (V79-V88, V82 omitted)

and three age (Al-A3) parameters. Thus in general one should not expect least
squares estimates of a, 0a and fi

to

be the same in the two specifications.

Second, while the age coefficients condition on time in (2), in (3) the
conditioning is on vintage. In particular, in (3) the aa age coefficients are
interpreted as the effect on price of age (relative to a new model), holding

vintage V (not time T) fixed. Since the conditioning changes, least squares
estimates should also be expected to differ in (2) and (3).

To understand this better, consider a V-A specification such as (3). An
implicit time coefficient such as that for, say, T88 could be computed in four
different ways:

aO
— av86 +
a,2'
at,88
at,88 — av,88 +

t,88 — av,87 +
and/or at,88 —

av,85

+

aa,3.

(4)

Similarly, with the T-A specification as in (2), the implicit vintage coefficient
for, say, V85, could be computed alternatively as

av85 —

aV8S

—

t,85

-

aa,O, av,85 — at,86

t87 a2'
-

-

and/or a85 — at,88

aa,3.

(5)

Least squares estimation of the V-A and T-A specifications implicitly weight and
average over these four possibilities in different ways, and thus there is no
reason to expect implicit and direct estimates of the a., aa, and/or at
coefficients to be numerically equivalent in the T-A and V-A models.
But if the V-A and T-A specifications yield varying estimates because of
their distinct conditioning and use of differing information, how is one to

choose among them? For purposes of computing quality-adjusted price indexes, the
directly estimated time coefficients based on (2) have a clear interpretation,
and for that reason specification (2) has formed the basis of almost all hedonic

price index studies. But is it necessary to delete the V variables completely --

can one not employ a specification that efficiently uses information simultaneously from the T, A and V dummy variables, yet avoids exact collinearity?

This issue has been addressed by Robert E. Hall (1971] whose context
involved use of a balanced panel data set for second-hand trucks. In our

MICROCOMPUTER PRICES

Context,

-

Page 14 -

the maximal parameterization consistent with avoiding exact collinearity

among the T, V and A dummy variables turns out to be one in which eight of the
original ten vintage dummy variables are added to the T-A specification (2), i.e.
two (not one) of the vintage dummies are deleted from the original set of ten

(V79 to V88).10'11 We can write such a specification as
in E'ivat —

a + T'at

+

A'aa +

V'a

+

X'$ + Uivat,

(6)

where the vector of dummy variables in V consists of eight elements. As Hall
noted, coefficients on the a should be interpreted as differences from the
average rate of growth of technical progress embodied but unobserved in pairwise

comparisons of vintages. For example, if one omitted the V82 and V83 dummy
variables, the a., coefficient estimates should then be interpreted as a contrast,
e.g. ,

the

coefficient on the V88 dummy variable should then be interpreted as the

difference between the average 1988 vintage effect and the mean of the average

vintage effects for 1982 and 1983. We suggest that a necessary condition for a
hedonic price equation to be satisfactory is that the portion of quality change
not captured by the characteristics variables should be unrelated to vintages,

i.e. in a desirable specification, the a should be approximately zero.
It follows that since the mq

coefficients

represent contrasts in average

rates of growth due to unobserved quality change, one can interpret a test that

the a — 0 as corresponding to a test that changes in characteristics among
models and over time adequately capture quality changes between vintages, for
average unobserved vintage effects are not systematically different in pairwise
comparisons among vintages. Further, if it were found that the a.q are
simultaneously different from zero, then one might interpret that result as
suggesting model misspecification, reflecting either the impact of omitted
characteristic variables, or invalid stability constraints on the characteristics

parameters over time. Hence, as noted above, a desirable specification would

MICROCOMPUTER PRICES

yield

-

Page 15 -

non-rejection of the null hypothesis that the a simultaneously equal zero,

in which case (2) would be empirically supported as a special case of (6)).2
Hypotheses concerning parameter restrictions can of course be tested using

the standard F-test methodology. As has been emphasized by, among

others,

Kenneth Arrow [1960] and Makoto Ohta and Zvi Griliches [1976], when samples are
large and standard test procedures are employed, one is likely to reject most
simplifying parameter restrictions on purely statistical grounds, even though

they may still serve as adequate approximations for the purpose at hand. There
are several ways one can deal with this problem.
First, to accommodate the larger sample size, we can compensate by choosing

very tight significance levels for the standard F-tests. In this paper we do
that by choosing .01 significance levels. Second, one can adopt a more agnostic
and conservative criterion that the null hypothesis holds only approximately
rather than exactly in the sample. In such a case, as Edward Learner [1978] has
shown, one can employ a Bayes procedure that in essence decreases the

significance level as the sample size n increases. Thus a second criterion we
use to assess the validity of our hypotheses is the Bayes factor asymptotic
approximation developed by Learner [1978, pp. 108.114], translated from the

condition that it exceeds one into an F-value expression. We call this LearnerBayes critical value the Bayes criterion.13
Third and finally, since our hedonic regressions are semi-logarithmic, the
root mean squared errors (RNSE) measure the unexplained variation in prices in,

roughly, percentage units. A reasonable criterion is to use the difference in
the RNSE of the constrained and unconstrained regressions as a relevant measure

of the price-explanatory power of a particular model. As our third test
criterion, we therefore will reject the null hypothesis when the RMSE under the
alternative results in a reduction of more than 5Z in the RNSE (the standard

deviation of the unexplained variation in log prices). With an average R4SE of

MICROCOMPUTER PRICES

-

Page 16 -

around 0.40, this RMSE criterion implies that we are looking for a movement of at
least about 0.02, say, 0.40 to 0.38, before we will "give up" on the more
parsimonious parsmeterization implied by the null hypothesis.

IV.

INITIAL RESULTS
We begin with results from a T-A model in which the time and age dummy

variables are included, but the vintage dummies are omitted, as in (2). Results
from such a regression are presented in Table 5. The dependent variable is the
logarithm of the real price (LRPRICE), and the variables are essentially those as

in Cohen and Kim. Regression results are reported for a pooled sample, retail
price observations, and discount price observations. Recall that in many cases,
s particular model appears in both the retail and discount markets. Given the
specification of dummy variables, the estimated intercept term corresponds to
that for a model of age zero in 1982 having an 8-bit processor, no monitor or
extras, is not portable, is not in the discount market, and is made by IBM.
A number of results are worth noting. The coefficient on 1)1HZ is positive
and significant in all three regressions, but is largest in the discount market;

parameters on the LSLOTS variable follow a similar pattern. By contrast,
parameters on LRAM and LNUNFLP, though positive and significant, are larger in
the retail than discount market.

Second, in all three regressions the coefficients on the age variables are
positive, holding time fixed, suggesting that the age effects of selectivity are
substantial. Interestingly, the effect of age is largest in the retail market,
where the age premium is statistically significant and increases with age,
implying that list prices of all surviving computers do not drop "fast enough".

In the discount market, however, the age coefficients are statistically

insignificant and follow no pattern. This suggests that some type of selectivity
is occuring in the tranaition from retail to discount markets, and that

MICROCOMPUTER PRICES

conditional

-

Page 17 -

on having entered the discount market, there is little age

selectivity remaining.

In terms of other dummy variable coefficients, estimates of PROC16 and
PROC32 are positive, statistically significant and larger in the retail than
discount market, and the positive DPORT parameter estimate is larger in the

discount market. Although the general pattern of the time dummy variable
coefficient estimates is similar in the retail and discount markets -

- both

revealing declines in quality-adjusted prices since 1982, in the discount market
the pattern of estimates between D83, D84 and D85 is not monotonic, suggesting
that the discount market is more volatile, or that our discount sample is too
small in these years to generate reliable parameter estimates.
Notice also that the DDISC coefficient in the pooled regression is negative
(-

.2903) and significant, as expected. We tested the null hypothesis that, aside

from a parallel shift due to being in the discount market, all coefficients are

identical in the retail and discount markets. The F-test statistic corresponding
to this null hypothesis is 2.77, while the .01 critical value is 1.73. Hence, on
the basis of the F-test criterion, the null hypothesis of parameter equality in

discount and retail markets is rejected. However, the Bayes critical value is
7.39, considerably greater than the F-statistic of 2.77. In terms of RMSE, the
improvement under the alternative hypothesis is 1.94X. Overall, we interpret
these results as suggesting that the evidence supporting the null hypothesis of
parameter equality (aside from a parallel shift) in the two markets is modest.

We also checked Out two other Chow-type tests. First, we ran separate
regressions for the age equal zero, one, two and three years old sub-samples, and
compared the residual sums of squares with that from the pooled model reported in

column one of Table 5. The calculated F-test statistic is 2.66, while the .01

traditional critical value is 1.44, the Bayes large sample-adjusted critical
value is 8.11, and the improvement in RNSE under the alternative hypothesis is

MICROCOMPUTER PRICES

4.52%.

Hence, although a tight

criterion

-

Page 19 -

suggests rejection of the null, the

more conservative Bayes and RMSE approaches lend only marginal support in favor
of the alternative hypothesis.

Finally, we ran seven yearly regressions, one for each year from 1982 to
1988, and then compared the residual sums of squares from these regressions with

that from the pooled model reported in column one of Table 5. Here we found more
support for the notion of parameter instability. In particular, while the F-test
statistic for the null hypothesis of parameter equality is 5.18 with a .01

critical value of 1.32, the Bayes critical value is larger at 9.03. However, the
improvement in RMSE under the alternative hypothesis is substantial -- 15.76%.

Thus, parameters do not appear to be stable. We will return to a discussion of
parameter instability over time later in this section.
As discussed earlier, an alternative functional form specification involves
including vintage and age dummies -- see equation (3), instead of the time and

age dummies as in (2). Recall that regression results (including R2, parameter
estimates and standard errors) will vary somewhat when using the V-A
specification rather than the T-A representation, and that this should not be
surprising, for in (2) the total number of T-A-V dummy variable coefficients

estimated directly is nine, while in (3) it is twelve. The summary statistics
results found in the very bottom portion of Table 6 illustrate this variation

among

the

various T-A and V-A specifications, for R2 and R1'tSE values differ.14

One result of particular interest here concerns the age coefficients. As
is seen in Table 6, with the V-A specification the age coefficients become
negative and statistically significant, and increase in absolute value with age.
We interpret these age coefficients, conditioning on vintage, as capturing the
average decline in prices of surviving computer models given steady improvements

in new computers entering the market, i.e. as the average difference between the

time and vintage effects. In a somewhat vague sense, therefore, these age
coefficients capture the average effect of technical progress-induced
obsolescence in our sample.

Since the interpretations and results from the T-A and V-A specifications
differ considerably, and although our purpose of computing price indexes lends
priori support to use of the T-A model specification in Table 5, one might still
question whether using information from vintages in addition to that contained in

the T-A model significantly improves model fit. In the previous section we noted
that a full T-A-V specification is possible, provided that two variables are

deleted from the V vector. Moreover, in our context a test for the null

hypothesis that the a

coefficients

are simultaneously equal to zero can be

interpreted as a specification test, providing information on whether the effects
of unobserved and omitted characteristic variables are systematic

among vintage

comparisons, and/or whether equality constraints on characteristics parameters
are invalid over vintages.

We therefore ran an additional regression in which eight vintage dummy
variables were added to the model reported in column 1 of Table 5, and V82 and

MICROCOMPUTER PRICES

-

Page 22 -

V83 were deleted. The F-test statistic for the null hypothesis that cxv —

0 is

5.94, the traditional .01 F-critical value is 2.51, the Bayes criterion value is
7.09, and the improvement in RMSE under the alternative hypothesis is 4.84%.
Thus the traditional F-test suggests rather decisive rejection of the null
hypothesis, the Bayes criticsl value of 7.09 is only slightly larger than the
calculated F-statistic of 5.94, and the improvement in RNSE is almost up to our

5% threshhold. Hence, although the evidence is not clearcut, we interpret these
results as providing some support for the alternative hypothesis, and therefore
as admonishing us to assess our T-A specification in column 1 of Table S more
closely, examining in particular what implicit parameter restrictions might be
contributing to rejection of the null hypothesis.
This led us back to examine our earlier year-by-year regressions, and to

look for patterns of parameter inequality over time. Our inspection revealed
that although coefficients on a number of variables trended over time, the most
marked trends were for coefficients on the LRAM, 121HZ, LHRDDSK and DOTHER

variables. We then specified and estimated two additional models, one an
overlapping sample model in which three separate regressions were run for the
overlapping years 1982-84, 1984-86 and 1986-88, and the other a pooled 1982-88
run with four time-interaction variables added, LRAM*TC, UIHZ*TC, LHRDDSK*TC and
DOTHER*TC, where TC is a time counter increasing annually from zero in 1982 to

six in 1988. Results from these overlavoing and time-interaction regressions are
presented in Table 7.
The results presented in Table 7 represent an improvement in the model
specification, accounting somewhat for the considerable variation among parameter

estimates over time. For example, in the 1982-84, 1984-86 and 1986-88
regressions, coefficient estimates on 12AM, LHRDDSK, LNUMFLP and DOTHER fall

while that on 111HZ increases. Trends are also apparent in several

other coefficients. Moreover, when the pooled 1982-88 regression model with
time-interactions is estimated, negative and statistically significant estimates
are obtained for LRAM*TC (-.0885), LHRDDSK*TC (-.0137) and DOTHER*TC (-.0648),

while that on LMHZ*TC (.037) is positive and significant. Hence both of these
more general specifications appear to provide improved estimates.
To check further on the validity of these two specifications, we added to
each regression the set of eight dummy vintage variables, and then tested the
null hypothesis that o,. —

0.

Our results are more satisfying, and lend qualified

support for the models reported in Table 7. In particulsr, as shown in Table 8
below, for 1982-84 and 1984-86, the calculated F-statistics are less than the .01
critical values, for 1986-88 the calculated F-statistic is larger, but in all
three cases F-statistics sre smaller than the Bayes criterion, and the improve-

ment in RMSE with vintage variables included is less than 1.5%. Hence, for all
three overlapping models, whatever the effects of omitted and unobserved
charscteristics, they do not appear to be systematic among vintage comparisons.
With the pooled 1982-88 time-interaction model, results sre roughly similar

to those from the overlapping models. The cslculated F-statistic is larger than
the .01 critical value but less than half the Bayes criterion, and the
improvement in the RMSE when vintage variables are added is less than 1%. Thus

there is little basis to choose among these two specifications. However, we
expect that the constant change in parameters implied by the interactive time
counter would become increasingly inappropriate as additional time observations

were added. On this criterion, therefore, we have a mild preference for the
specification involving three overlapping regressions.

Although further experimentation with other combinations of characteristics
variables would most likely be useful, we now move on to using several of the
above most promising specifications to construct quality-adjusted price indexes
for PC's.

V.

PRICE INDEXES
Price indexes can be constructed in a variety of ways using the results of

our various hedonic price equations. Although possibilities are limited when
quantity sales data on the various models are unavailable, numerous procedures

can be implemented given enough available data. In this section we construct and
comment on several price indexes, all based on our hedonic regression equations,
but varying in their interpretation and in their use of parameter estimates and
quantity weights.

We begin with price indexes based on direct transformation of estimated

hedonic price coefficients, and interpreted as price indexesholding quality

over time. In the first three rows of Table 9 we present implicit PC

price indexes computed directly from the three T-A regression equations reported
in Table 5, constructed here simply as the exponentiated estimated coefficients

on the time dummy variables, with T82 set to zero. The values in psrentheses are
percent changes from the previous year, computed as lOO*(PIt -

PIt.j)/PIt1,

where P1 is the price index. Note that the price indexes in the T-A model are
the estimated time effects from regressions holding age and other characteristics

constant. Overall, we see that average annual growth rates (AACR) are similar
for the pooled, retail and discount equations (about -28% per year), although the
deflators for discounted models tend to be somewhat unstable from 1983 to 1985.

In the second set of three rows in Table 9, implicit price indexes are
presented based on direct exponentiation of the estimated vintage coefficients

from the V-A specifications in Table 6. The interpretation of these price
indexes is slightly different --

they are not time effects, but rather are based

on vintage coefficients, holding age and other characteristics fixed. As is seen
in Table 9, these price indexes suggest slightly alower declines in quality
adjusted prices than those based on T-A regressions (especially for discount
models), and also reveal greater instability, particularly between 1982 and 1985.
One might think of these V-A price indexes as tracing out quality-adjusted
price deflators for various vintages having AGE — 0 (since price indexes for 1979
to 1988 are computed directly from the V79 to V88 vintage coefficients, assuming

AGE —

0),

but estimation of the underlying coefficients is based on a sample

including models of all ages. An alternative procedure for constructing a price
index for new models only -

technological "frontier" -

- an

- is

index that might be construed as tracing out the

to estimate parameters from a dats sample

restricted to new models, i.e. to models with AGE — 0.

Implicit price indexes

computed from such a regression are reported in the row named "New Models Only"

in Table 9l5 There it is seen that a "new model only" price index declines more

-

MICROCOMPUTER PRICES

rapidly

Page 27 -

than those based on full-sample T-A and V-A specifications; in

particular, the AACR from 1982 to 1988 is -30.15%.

The two final implicit price indexes computed directly from hedonic
regression equations without use of quantity sales weights are given in Table 9

in the rows marked "Overlapping" and "Time Interactions". The overlapping price
indexes are based on the three overlapping regressions reported in Table 7. They
are computed by directly exponentiating the coefficient estimates on the time
dummy variables, linked so that, for example, the implicit 1985 and 1986 price
indexes are the products of the exponentiated coefficients for 1984 and 1985, and

1984 and 1986, respectively. Notice that with an overlapping index procedure,
the quality weights are constant only for sub-periods, and coefficient estimates

reflect varying sample means among sub-periods. Interestingly, the overlapping
price indexes fall at almost the same AAGR as that based on a "new models only"
regression, although the overlapping price indexes fall more rapidly in the
earlier years.

The computation of price indexes based on the time-interaction model
requires use of sample characteristics data, not just values of estimated

coefficients. For example, using parameter estimates on the time interaction
terms reported in Table 7, for the log-change in quality-adjusted prices between
year t and year t-l we first compute

procedure results in a very substantial rate of price decline - -

than 33%

per year. This large decline reflects the fact that sample means of the
variables are all increasing with time, and these means are multiplied by the
relatively large negative coefficients in (7).
One

important

problem with each of the above price indexes is that they

fail to reflect changes over time in the mix of models. Recall that the

MICROCOMPUTER PRICES

direct

-

Page 29 -

hedonic regression coefficients in the T-A models can be interpreted as

holding quality constant either by fixing the base of characteristic values

over time, or by fixing their valuation (parameter estimates). In a world
with rapidly evolving new technologies, the notion of a fixed characteristic
base as portraying representative transactions becomes increasingly

inappropriate. What would be preferable is an index number procedure that
accounts for compositional changes in models over time.16 Such a computation
requires, of course, quantity and revenue sales data by model by year. As our
final index number computations, we now consider a Divisia index that weights
quality-adjusted prices of models by their revenue shares.
Specifically, our calculation of a (Tornqvist approximation to the)

Divisia index proceeds as follows. First consider a model j observed in both

time periods 0 and 1. Let

where Z1j and Z0j are vectors of all regression variables except for the

implies that

(9)

The left-hand side of (9) states that the log-change in the quality-adjusted
price of model j from 0 to 1 equals the change in observed prices minus the
change in quality, where quality is evaluated using least squares regression

coefficients and values of the characteristics. Alternatively, the right-hand
side of (9) states that an equivalent way of computing the log-change in the
quality-adjusted price of model j is simply to sum

the

difference in estimated

-

MICROCOMPUTER PRICES

Page 30 -

time dummies plus the difference in least squares residuals. The choice of
which of these two methods to employ in computing quality-adjusted prices can
be baaed simply on relative computational convenience.

Several other features of (9) are worth noting. First, if there is no
change in the characteristics of model j between 0 and 1 (i.e. ,

not become a new version in period 1), then (Zjj -

16j)

the

model has

— 0, this term

drop outs of (9), and in essence the quality-adjusted log price change is

computed using the traditional matched model procedure. Second, if the least
squares residual is the same in the two time periods, i.e. if 'lj -

— 0,

then the log-change in quality-adjusted prices is simply equal to the change

in the time dummy coefficients. Note that residuals have a useful
interpretation in the hedonic price equation, for they provide evidence on
whether relative to the overall market, a particular model is over- or under-

priced.17 An interesting issue concerns the relationship between these
residuals and the revenue shares garnered by each model. Since for each year
the sum of residuals is zero, we would expect that if shares are uncorrelated
with residuals, it would also be the case that X

5jEj

= 0.

Once (9) is computed for every model j in years 0 and 1, the log-change
in quality adjusted prices over all models is calculated as the revenue shsre-

total value of shipments over all models in the appropriate time period.

MICROCOMPUTER PRICES

Page 31 -

The calculation in (9) is feasible only when model j is part of a
surviving cohort of models. In fact, however some models exit the market
each year, while others enter. To account for these entering and exiting
models, several adjustments must be made to (9) and (10).
Consider the case of a model that enters the market in time period 1.

Obviously, its price cannot be observed in period 0, and thus use of (9) to

compute a quality-adjusted price index is not feasible. One

can,

however, use

the estimated hedonic regression equation to predict such missing prices. In
particular, substitute the right-hand side of (8b) into (9), let the values of

Z1j and Zo be equal, set

to zero, and rearrange. This yields an

expression for quality-adjusted log-price changes for entering models in
period 1, computed in two alternative but equivalent ways as

ln P1 -

j.

(11)

Similarly, for exiting models that were observed in period 0 but not in period
I, we employ hedonic regression procedures to predict the price of that model
would it have survived to period 1.

Zoj and

and then rearrange. This yields the

appropriate log-change in the quality-adjusted prices for exiting models as

ln

Eoj.

(12)

Once these log-changes in quality-adjusted prices are computed for all
continuing, entering and exiting models, we calculate revenue shares (setting
so,j to zero for entering models, and 5l,j to zero for exiting models, thereby

effecively using one-half of the last or first observed share weight), and
then compute an aggregate log-change in quality-adjusted prices over all
models using (10).

Several other points are worth noting. First, an interesting feature of
(9), (11) and (12) is that they employ as information the values of the least

squares residuals. Hence the Divisia quality-adjusted index number procedure

MICROCOMPUTER PRICES

-

Page 32 -

takes into account whether those models that exited (or entered) had prices
above or below the average quality-adjusted prices. Note, however, that the
weight given these exiting and entering models is likely to be minor, since
their average revenue share in periods 0 and 1 is in most cases rather small.

Second, empirical implementation of this Divisia index number procedure

requires data on value of shipments by model. Proprietary data on shipments,
installations and value of shipments by model and year for about 950 of the
1265 models in our estimation sample were kindly provided us by the

International Data Corporation. These data formed the basis of our shareweights used in (10).
Restricting our sample to models covered by the IDC data set and
computing revenue values by model-year as the product of the IDC estimates of
average price paid and number of models shipped, we have computed Divisia
quality-adjusted price indexes separately for continuing, entering and exiting

models, and for selected aggregates)8 Our results, using parameter estimates
from the T-A pooled and T-A overlapping estimated models, are presented in

Table 10. A number of results are worth noting.
We begin with results from the T-A pooled estimation. Inspection of the
top row of Table 10 reveals that the real quality-adjusted Divisia price index
for all PC models declined at an AAGR of -28.2X from 1982 to 1988, virtually

identical to the -28.7% AACR of the direct hedonic T-A pooled price index. A
striking difference between these two price indexes, however, is that the
Divisia index reveals a much smoother decline over time, with year-to-year

declines ranging between 20% and 37%, whereas year-to-year declines for the
direct I-A pooled index vary from 1% to 36%.
Second, changes in the price indexes for the continuing models are quite
different from those models entering and exiting between 1982 and 1988.
Specifically, if one examines the next three rows in Table 10, one sees that
the price declines of the continuing models were on average larger (-30.6%)

MICROCOMPUTER PRICES

than thosa for the entering (-24.9%) and exiting (-20.0%) models. An
implication is that vendors of incumbent models responded quite aggressively
to the competition provided by entrants, dropping prices at relatively high

rates. Note that these reaults can be reconciled with the econometric
findings reported earlier that in the T-A specification, estimated
coefficients on the age variables were positive, provided one interprets the
latter result as reflecting selectivity due to, perhaps, unobserved positive
quality differentials among the survivors as vintages progress.
Third, the pricing strategies employed for entering and exiting models

are quite different. Over the 1982-88 time period, quality-adjusted price
declines for entering models were on average larger (-24.9%) than those for

exiting models (-20.0%). However, while the quality-adjusted prices were on
average flat between 1982 and 1985 for exiting models, these models exhibited
very large price declines from 1985 to 1988.
In the final set of four rows of Table 10, we present Divisia price
indexes using parameter estimates from the 1982-84, 1984-86 and 1986-88

overlapping regressions. The remarkable result here is that in spite of using
a rather different set of regressions, average annual growth rates of quality-

adjusted prices from 1982 to 1988 are hardly affected. Specifically, the AACR
for all computer models based on the pooled and overlapping regressions are,
respecitvely, -28.2 and -28.0%; for continuing models, -30.6% and -30.5%; for
entering models, -24.9% and -22.4%; and for exiting models, -20.0% and -23.7%.
Although year-to-year variations occur between the Divisia pooled and
overlapping regression price indexes, AACR are reasonably robust.

SUMMARY REMARKS
The simultaneous existence of incumbent, entering and exiting models

raises issues of product heterogeneity in the microcomputer market, the nature

MICROCOMPUTER PRICES

of

Page 35 -

price and quality competition, and creates ambiguity in how one constructs

and interprets price indexes. Those are the issues on which we have focused
in this paper.

Specifically, we have reported results from estimation of a variety of
hedonic regression equations using en unbalanced panel data set for 1265
model-years from 1982 to 1988, and have developed and implemented empirically

a specification test for selecting preferable hedonic price equations. We
have discussed in detail the alternative interpretation of dummy variable
coefficients in models having time and age, vintage and age, and all of the

time, age and vintage dummy variables as regressors. Based on these estimated
hedonic price equations, we then computed quality-adjusted price indexes using

a variety of procedures. This provided us with indexes having varying
interpretations --

constant

average quality price indexes, price indexes for

new models only, and quality-adjusted price indexes portraying representative
transactions that take into account the changing model composition in our

sample over time. Not surprisingly, average annual growth rates for these
varying price indexes also differed, although all showed a substantial decline
in quality-adjusted prices over the 1982-88 time period.
Our research in this paper is preliminary, and much still remains to be

done. One item high on our research agenda involves obtaining model-specific
performance measures for specific numerical tasks, such as the number of
instructions executed per unit of time, and then re-doing our hedonic

regressions with such performance measures added as regressors. Moreover,
issues of parameter instability and choice of variables to include in the set
of characteristics are also potentially important, and need further

examination. Finally, our least squares residuals provide economic
information either on over- or under-pricing of models relative to the market
as a whole, or else reflect the effects of omitted variables or differential

market power in different PC market segments. Hence an interesting application involves examining in greater detail the relationships among residuals,
entering, continuing, and exiting models, and realized market shares.

reflect price changes for other models, for 1983 and price changes of models
sold by IBM and three additional manufacturers for 1984-87."
5The first PC advertising appeared in the New York Times in 1981.
6A model is defined as discounted if it is sold by a vendor other than the
brand-name manufacturer. Thus, for example, IBM models sold by IBM are
considered as retail price observations, while IBM models sold by Computerland
or 47th Street Photo are treated as discounted price observations. PC Limited
models (sold only by mail order from PC Limited) are treated as retail, since
PC Limited is the only vendor.
7However, one cannot identify parameters in a full quadratic expansion of the
three variables, due to the identity in (1). For a discussion in the context
of age, period and cohort models, see Stephen Fienberg and William Mason
[1985].

related discussion of this issue in the context of age, period and cohort
effects in earnings equations is presented by James Heckinan and Richard Robb
(1985].

9See, for example, David W. Cartwright and Scott D. Smith (1986] , Rosanne Cole
et al. (1986], Robert J. Gordon (1989] and Jack E. Triplett (1989a].

10See especially Robert Hall (1971], p. 248.

There is intuitive appeal to this additional normalization. Hall defined
the price index as the product of vintage effects (embodied technical
progress), depreciation, and time (disembodied technical progress). Thus the
logarithm of the price index is the sum of these three effects, each in rates
of growth. To normalize the level of the price index, one normalizes levels
of each of the three effects, i.e., one deletes one variable from each of the
T, V and A dummy variable sets, and normalizes relative to that variable. But
in addition, one must normalize at least one of the growth rates, since the
product of the three effects implies that components are unidentified. This
additional normalization is accomplished by deleting an additional vintage

variable,

thereby yielding a contrast in levels of the logarithmic regression,
which is equivalent to a normalization in growth rates of one of the three
components. For additional discussion, see Robert Hall [1971].

l2 is worth noting here that the choice of which two dummy variables to
delete from the V vector is arbitrary in the sense that goodness of fit and
numerical values of least squares estimates of a and the fl's will be
unaffected. However, the interpretation and numerical values of the least
squares estimates of the a, a and my will depend on this choice.

l)/q,

131..eamer has derived this to equal (nk).(q1n where n is sample size,
k is the number of free parameters estimated in the unconstrained regression,
and q is the number of parameter restrictions. For an application of Learner's
adjustment to the standard F-test procedure in the Context of large samples,
see Makoto Ohta and Zvi Griliches [1976].

Whi1e not reported here for reasons of space, it is worth noting that the
slope coefficient estimates differ between the T-A and V-A specifications,
although in many cases the differences are not large.
15The underlying regression equation is of the same form as in Table 5, except
that age variables are deleted. Price indexes are computed directly by
exponentiating the estimated coefficients on the time dummy variables.
16For a recent discussion of weighting issues in the context of compositional
changes, see Jack A. Triplett [l989b] and the references cited therein.
17This under- or over-pricing might also reflect of course the effects of
unobserved omitted variables, or of differential market power in differing
segments of the PC market.
18We divided revenues among retail and discount listings of the same model in
proportion to the relative number of listings. It is also worth noting that
mean values of the revenue shares of continuing, entering and exiting models
from 1982 to 1988 are 54Z, 26% and 20%, respectively. There is considerable
variation in these shares over our sample time period, however.
