JEL No. I12,I24,I26
ABSTRACT
Previous studies have shown that years of formal schooling attained affects health behaviors, but
little is known about how the stringency of academic programs affects such behaviors, especially
among youth. Using national survey data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System
(YRBS), we study the effects of mathematics and science high-school graduation requirements
(HSGR) on high school students’ risky health behaviors--specifically on drinking, smoking, and
marijuana use. We find that an increase in mathematics and science HSGR has significant
negative impacts on alcohol consumption among high-school students, especially males and nonwhite students. The effects of math and science HSGR on smoking and marijuana use are also
negative but generally less precisely estimated. Our results suggest that curriculum design may
have potential as a policy tool to curb youth drinking.

I. INTRODUCTION
Since the seminal work of Grossman (1972), the relationship between schooling and
health has been well established. Years of formal schooling attained is strongly correlated with
health behaviors and outcomes, with many papers providing evidence for a causal effect of
schooling on health.1 Most previous work on this question measures schooling in terms of
years spent in school or highest degree attained while ignoring heterogeneity in the quality of
schooling.2 Even less is known about how educational quality affects the health behaviors of
youth specifically. 3 This question is important given that drinking and smoking habits
established in youth are often persistent over the life cycle (Farrell and Fuchs, 1982; Wechsler
et al., 1995; Arria et al., 2008); thus, deterring risky behaviors at younger ages could have
significant long-term benefits (Gruber and Zinman, 2001; Auld, 2005).

Readers can refer to the following papers on education and health: education and smoking (De Walque, 2007;

Grimard and Parent, 2007; Park and Kang, 2008; Heckman et al., 2014), education and self-reported health
(Adams, 2002; Arendt, 2005), education and mortality (Lleras-Muney, 2005; Buckles et al., 2016), education and
infant health (McCrary and Royer, 2011), education and various health behaviors (Kenkel et al., 2006; Cutler and
Lleras-Muney, 2010; Conti et al., 2010; Savelyev and Tan, 2014); and a literature review on the impacts of
education on health (Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2006).
2

Exceptions include Fletcher and Frisvold (2011, 2014), who find that college selectivity affects both health

behaviors and health outcomes. Frisvold and Golberstein (2011) find that improvements in school quality,
measured by the pupil-teacher ratio, average teachers’ wages, and length of the school year, amplify the effects of
education on self-rated health, smoking, obesity, and mortality. Sansani (2011) shows that school quality,
measured by its financial return, length of the school term, and relative teacher wage, predicts mortality.
3

Cowan (2011) finds that lower college costs mitigate risky behaviors among high-school students. Jensen and

Lleras-Muney (2012) show that increasing schooling and decreasing work reduce smoking among teens in the
Dominican Republic.

In this study, we examine how high school graduation requirements (HSGR) regarding
mathematics and science credits impact the health behaviors of high-school students. The
graduation requirements, set by individual states, represent the minimum number of courses in
specific subjects that must be passed in order to earn a high school diploma in that state. Though
a few states do not have specific course requirements (leaving it up to local school districts
instead), most states set the minimums themselves. Inspired by the National Commission on
Excellence in Education’s influential 1983 report, A Nation at Risk, which argued in favor of
raising high school stringency in order to address the academic underachievement of American
youth, many states have legislated increases in their HSGR over the last several decades (Clune
and White, 1992; Chaney et al., 1997; Teitelbaum, 2003). A growing literature in economics
has studied various education and labor-market effects of these changes (Clune and White,
1992; Chaney et al., 1997; Schiller and Muller, 2003; Teitelbaum, 2003; Federman, 2007;
Goodman, 2017).
In our paper, we follow most of the literature in focusing specifically on mathematics and
science requirements because these courses have been shown to be important determinants of
various future socioeconomic outcomes for youth including college attainment and earnings.4

4

Levine and Zimmerman (1995) find that high-school math and science courses have a positive impact on future

earnings. Similarly, Rose and Betts (2004) and Joensen and Nielsen (2009) show that mathematics courses taken
in high school are related to future earnings. Bottia et al. (2015) find that taking physics and attending a school
with a math and science focused program are closely associated with students’ choice of STEM as a major. Kim
et al. (2015) show that completing an Algebra II course in high school leads to a higher chance of going to college.
Federman (2007) shows that higher state math and science graduation requirements lead to a higher probability
of choosing a technology major in college. Goodman (2017) finds that state changes in minimum high school

This paper adds to the literature on youth risky behavior by considering how the stringency of
high school via changes to state-level graduation requirements affects students’ drinking,
smoking, and marijuana use.
There are at least two possible channels through which HSGR may affect risky health
behaviors. The first is through the time constraint. Stricter state requirements for math and
science lead students to take more courses and to enroll in higher-level courses (Clune and
White, 1992; Chaney et al., 1997; Schiller and Muller, 2003; Teitelbaum, 2003; Federman,
2007; Goodman, 2017). Schiller and Muller (2003) find that students in states with higher
graduation requirements tend to enroll in higher level math courses as freshmen and persist in
taking more advanced courses. The positive change of courses both in quantity and difficulty
may leave students with less time to engage in substance use.
Second, there may be expectation effects. Since taking courses in math and science in high
school has positive impacts on future college attainment and earnings, students in states with
higher HSGR may have higher expectations about these future outcomes. Becker (1965) shows
theoretically that an increase in expected future earnings could induce a decline in the amount
of time dedicated to consumption activities because time becomes more expensive. As Cowan
(2011) shows empirically, greater expectations for college attainment are associated with better
health behaviors in high school. Therefore, higher HSGR may lead to a decrease in substance
use through this channel.
Using Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBS) national survey data from 1993
to 2013 and adopting a generalized difference-in-difference (DID) framework, we show that

math requirements substantially increase black students’ completed math coursework and later earnings.

4

an increase in math and science HSGR has significant negative impacts on the alcohol
consumption of high-school students with no accompanying increase in the consumption of
cigarettes or marijuana. The effects of HSGR are typically larger among males than females
and non-white students than white students. These results are consistent with Goodman (2017),
who finds that state math requirements affect math course taking and later earnings of blacks
but not whites, with the largest effects occurring for black males specifically.5 Furthermore,
our results are robust to the inclusion of many state-level education policy variables that have
been used in the HSGR literature as controls, which guards against the possibility that HSGR
is merely a proxy for other policy changes that sometimes coincide with updates to a state’s
HSGR.
A weakness of our study is that with our data, we cannot distinguish the mechanism by
which HSGR affects alcohol use. We note, however, that the effects we estimate are
concentrated among a group—racial/ethnic minority students—whose course-taking and posthigh school outcomes are plausibly most affected by HSGR. Nevertheless, we acknowledge
that more evidence is needed to determine how HSGR alters the substance use decisions of
high-schoolers.
Another potential shortcoming of our paper is that more stringent HSGR may induce some
students to drop out of school, and our data contains only high-school students. One might
suspect that students who engage in riskier behaviors are more likely to drop out, causing

5

In a supplementary analysis, Goodman (2017) also estimates large effects of math requirements on math courses

taken by Hispanics. These results are not part of the main analysis due to the use of state of birth as a proxy for
state of high school attendance, which is missing for a large proportion of (foreign born) Hispanics.

5

sample selection bias. We initially address this issue by examining the effect of HSGR on the
probability of school enrollment at different ages using U.S. Census and American Community
Survey data. We find little evidence that dropout is affected by HSGR over our sample period.
Some previous studies do find that HSGR affects dropout (Lillard and DeCicca, 2001; Plunk
et al., 2014).6 We show that this is likely due at least in part to differences in sample periods
across studies.
Another way we address the sample selection issue is by adopting the method proposed
by Carpenter and Stehr (2008), which is to estimate our models using only students who are 16
years old or under. Partly because of compulsory schooling laws, there are many fewer youth
absentees under 17, making selection less of a concern in this subsample. In this case, the
magnitudes of some of our results diminish modestly, which is consistent with either larger
effects of HSGR among older students or modest selection bias. Regardless, we continue to
find economically and statistically significant effects of HSGR on drinking among the younger
subsample, indicating that the potential selection bias cannot account for the negative impacts
on drinking identified in our main regressions.
Lastly, we test the validity of our identification strategy using a placebo-type analysis.
Because HSGR is a non-binary treatment and many states changed their HSGR more than once,
a traditional event-study framework is not suitable in our setting. Instead, we examine the
effects of “placebo” policies that are lags and leads of true changes in HSGR. The results
support the notion that changes in students’ health behaviors are indeed caused by HSGR, since

6

In contrast, Clark and See (2011), examining the possible dropout effect of the higher graduation standard in

Florida, find no effect.

6

the policy effects generally get weaker as the placebo treatment moves further away from the
true treatment period.
Though comparing different policies for curbing substance use among youths is beyond
the scope of our paper, our results suggest that improving the rigor of high-school education
may be an attractive way to accomplish this goal. First, raising HSGR increases math and
science course-taking, which is a primary goal of the education reforms since the 1980s (Clune
and White, 1992; Teitelbaum, 2003). Second, raising HSGR may be more feasible than
increasing taxes enough to have similar effects on risky behaviors, especially when raising the
(full) price of one substance might only push youths to other substances.7 However, more work
is needed to ascertain the full costs and benefits of making high school education more rigorous.
II. DATA
II.A. HSGR
Data on math and science HSGR is taken from the Digest of Education Statistics (DES)
published by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The DES reports the
minimum Carnegie units of mathematics and science courses required for high-school
graduation by 50 states and the District of Columbia.8 Until 2001, the DES reported the first
graduating class that was affected by a change to HSGR. Starting in 2002, the DES stopped

7

Chaloupka and Laixuthai (1997) find that drinking among youths is negatively related to beer prices while

positively related to the full price of marijuana, suggesting that beer and marijuana are substitutes among youths.
DiNardo and Lemieux (2001) show that raising the minimum legal drinking age increases marijuana consumption.
Crost and Guerrero (2012) find that alcohol and marijuana are substitutes in a minimum drinking age law context.

One Carnegie unit is defined as 120 hours of instruction time, which can be roughly translated into one academic

year (two semesters) of instruction in one course.

reporting this information. Hence, we collected the impact cohort information from the
education board or department of each state. Readers can refer to Appendix 1 for further
explanation. The final compiled dataset contains math and science HSGR for graduation years
1993 to 2014 matched with each student using his/her state and predicted graduation year. In
order to match HSGR with each student, we assume all students are admitted in fall and
expected to graduate in 4 years. Since the national YRBS is conducted during February to May
of each odd-numbered year (Brener et al., 2013), a 12th grade student surveyed in year X in
state Y would be matched with the HSGR of graduation year X in state Y, and an 11th grade
student surveyed in year X in state Y would be matched with the HSGR of graduation year X+1
in state Y, and so on.
We add the required Carnegie units of math and science courses together to get the total
number of minimum required Carnegie units in math and science courses by each state and
graduation year, which will be used in our regressions and be referred to as HSGR or math and
science HSGR.9 Table 1 and Figure 1 shows the HSGR of each state for the selected graduating
classes of 1993, 2003, and 2013. Our dataset indicates that from the graduating class of 1993
to that of 2013, 41 states (including the District of Columbia) changed their HSGR at least once
and 10 states remained unchanged.10 Appendix 2 shows the complete HSGR dataset we use

9

We also tried coding math and science HSGR separately and included them in our models. The results suggest

negative impacts of both math HSGR and science HSGR, with no clear evidence of which one is more important.
But since many states change math HSGR and science HSGR at the same time, including these separately yield
less precise results due to the collinearity. Therefore, like Plunk et al. (2014), this study combines math and science
HSGR together.

State changes to HSGR have been focused on math and science courses for several decades (Teitelbaum, 2003).

class of 1993. In the results section, we examine the possibility that states that choose to make
larger changes to their HSGR have different time-varying characteristics than states that make
smaller changes.
II.B. YRBS
Our data on the health behaviors of high-school students comes from the biannual Youth
Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBS) national survey from 1993 to 2011. It contains
147,374 observations of high school students in 47 states. Various health behaviors, as well as
demographic information on gender, age, grade, and race, are documented.11
Unfortunately, the YRBS survey does not contain some potential determinants of health
behaviors such as family income and parental education. However, the absence of these
variables would only be a problem if there were different trends in these factors across

In fact, during our sample period, only 9 states changed the English/language arts courses requirements, and 24
states changed the social studies requirements. From the graduating class of 1993 to that of 2013, the average
HSGR (unweighted) across states has gone up from 2.32 to 2.91 (in Carnegie units) for mathematics and from
2.10 to 3.26 for science, compared with an increase of HSGR from 3.85 to 3.97 for English/language arts and an
increase from 2.63 to 3.02 for social studies. Data sources: Table 152, DES1993 and Table 234.30, DES2013
(https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/). Considering the lack of variation in English/language arts and social
studies requirements over time, we do not include them in our regressions.
11

The response rate in YRBS varies by year. For example, 1993 YRBS has an overall response rate of 70% (78%

school response rate * 90% student response rate); 2003 YRBS has 67% (81% * 83%); while 2013 YRBS has 68%
(77% * 88%). Throughout 1993 to 2011, no YRBS survey has an overall response rate lower than 60%, and all
YRBS surveys have a student response rate of over 80%. See: 1993-2013 YRBS Data User’s Guide
(https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/data.htm).

treatment and control states. To address concerns about omitted variable bias, we add various
state-specific economic and policy variables (and state-specific linear time trends, in some
cases) as control variables in our models. These variables include median income,
unemployment rate, expenditures per pupil for public elementary and secondary education
(which will be referred to as “public school per pupil spending”), dummies indicating whether
states require a high school exit exam, the pupil-teacher ratio in public elementary and
secondary schools (which will be referred to as “pupil-teacher ratio”), cigarette tax, beer tax,
and medical marijuana legalization status from 1993 to 2011. The data sources are described
in Appendix 3. These variables are included to control for financial support for education, other
education reforms, the full price of substances, and differences in the economic environment
across states over time.12 The education policy covariates largely encompass those used as
controls in the HSGR literature including Lillard and DeCicca (2001), Plunk et al. (2014),
Federman (2007), and Goodman (2017).
Observations with at least one missing variable of interest, which include observations
from a few states in which there is no state level HSGR, are dropped from our regression sample.
That leaves us 116,063 total observations, including 56,110 males and 59,953 females, and
49,051 non-Hispanic white students (“white” for the purposes of this study) and 67,012
students who either identify as Hispanic or a racial category other than white (“non-white”).13

12

Previous studies have shown a relationship between alcohol taxes and youth drinking (Dee, 1999; Xuan et al.,

2013), cigarette taxes and youth smoking (Carpenter and Cook, 2008; DeCicca et. al., 2008; Hansen et al., 2015),
marijuana legalization and youth marijuana use (Chu, 2014; Anderson et al., 2015; Pacula et al., 2015; Wen et al.,
2015), and macroeconomic conditions and health (Ruhm, 1995, 2003, 2005, 2015; Ruhm and Black, 2002).
13

The YRBS has changed its questions on race/ethnicity several times over the years. For earlier years, it is

10

Summary statistics of the data we use are shown in Table 2.14 The vast majority of students
are between 14 and 18 years old. Students from each grade make up about a quarter of the total
sample. Black and Hispanic students are over-sampled relative to white students.
The percentage of students who use each of alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana is striking.
About 45% of high school students consumed alcohol in the last 30 days. The proportions of
students that binge drank, smoked, and used marijuana in the last 30 days are 28%, 25%, and
22%, respectively. During our sample period, high school students engaged in an average of
1.3 days of binge drinking, 2.7 days of drinking, 3.7 days of smoking, and 3.2 occasions of
marijuana use in the last 30 days. Male students were more likely to consume these substances
than females, and they tended to do so more frequently. As documented in other studies (Barnes
and Welte, 1986; O'Malley and Johnston, 2002; Miller et al., 2007), white students tend to
engage in higher levels of risky health behaviors than do non-white students.15

impossible to distinguish Hispanic white students from all Hispanics. Roughly 85% of students in our “non-white”
category are black or Hispanic or both.
14

Observations are weighted to be representative at the state level (the weighting method is discussed in detail in

the next section). The summary statistics of the unweighted data are very similar to the weighted values and
available upon request. After dropping observations with missing variables, t-tests show that students in our
regression sample tend to have healthier behaviors compared with the students dropped from our sample. The
comparison details are shown in Appendix 4.
15

Note that marijuana use is measured in “occasions” instead of “days” due to the YRBS survey design. Drinking

days, binge drinking days, smoking days, and marijuana use occasions (in last 30 days) are categorical variables.
In the YRBS national survey, students report their health behaviors by answering multiple choice questions. For
example, students are asked “During the past 30 days, on how many days did you have at least one drink of
alcohol?” and to choose from “A) 0 days, B) 1 or 2 days, C) 3 to 5 days, D) 6 to 9 days, E) 10 to 19 days, F) 20
to 29 days, and G) All 30 days”. We take the midpoint of each group as an approximation of the actual drinking

11

III. EMPIRICAL METHOD
The empirical specification of our model is:
𝐻𝐵𝑖𝑠𝑡 = 𝛼𝐻𝑆𝐺𝑅𝑖𝑠𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖𝑠𝑡 𝛽 + 𝑆𝑠𝑡 𝛾 + 𝛿𝑠 + 𝜏𝑡 + 𝜖𝑖𝑠𝑡 .

(1)

In this model, 𝐻𝐵𝑖𝑠𝑡 is individual 𝑖 ’s health behavior in state 𝑠 at time 𝑡 .
𝐻𝑆𝐺𝑅𝑖𝑠𝑡 represents the math and science HSGR the individual faces as defined in the previous
section, which depends on her state and predicted graduation year. 𝑋𝑖𝑠𝑡 contains all
individual-level control variables including dummies for gender, age, grade, and race. 𝑆𝑠𝑡
stands for all state-level control variables including median income, public school per pupil
spending, pupil-teacher ratio, unemployment rate, beer tax, cigarette tax, a state high school
exit exam dummy, and medical marijuana legalization status dummies. 𝛿𝑠 and 𝜏𝑡 are state
and year dummies, respectively. Our assumption for identifying 𝛼 is the typical DID
assumption that changes to HSGR within a state over time are exogenous to youths’ health
behavior decisions.
As shown in Table 2, we have four measures of drinking behavior, including “did binge
drink in last 30 days (1 if yes, 0 if no)”, “did drink in last 30 days (1 if yes, 0 if no)”, “number
of days binge drinking in last 30 days”, and “number of days drinking in last 30 days”; two
measures of smoking behavior, including “did smoke in last 30 days (1 if yes, 0 if no)” and
“number of days smoking in last 30 days”; and finally, two measures of marijuana use,

days when running OLS models (e.g., if a student chose the answer D, we label this student as having 7.5 drinking
days in the last 30 days). The same method applies to other categorical measures of substance use. Alternatively,
we analyze these categorical responses in ordered probit models and find similar results to our baseline OLS ones
(results available upon request).

12

including “did use marijuana in last 30 days (1 if yes, 0 if no)” and “times marijuana used in
last 30 days”. We use OLS to construct our baseline estimates in line with most previous studies,
but we also use discrete choice models, the results of which are consistent with those found in
the body of the paper and are available upon request.
There are two major issues regarding the YRBS national survey data. First, the data is not
representative at the state level, and the number of students surveyed from each state varies
considerably across cohorts. Because of that, we weight our sample so that observations in each
state-year pair are representative of the state’s share of national public high-school students, an
approximation of the proportion of total high-school students in each state among all highschool students in the nation.16 In other words, the weight for each observation is calculated
by
𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖𝑠𝑡 =

16

𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑃𝑢𝑏𝑙𝑖𝑐 𝐻𝑖𝑔ℎ 𝑆𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑙 𝐸𝑛𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑡
. 17
𝑁𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑃𝑢𝑏𝑙𝑖𝑐 𝐻𝑖𝑔ℎ 𝑆𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑙 𝐸𝑛𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑡 × 𝑂𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑠𝑡

The YRBS dataset contains a weighting variable itself, which is calculated based on student sex, race/ethnicity,

and grade to address nonresponse and the oversample of black and Hispanic students in order to be representative
at the national level, but not at the state level. In contrast, our weighting method produces a representative dataset
at the state level in terms of the state’s share among national students so that it can be used to produce state-level
estimates. However, our method is not able to adjust for nonresponse or demographic factors. As a result, blacks
and Hispanics remain over-sampled using our weighting method. Since our main goal is to estimate state level
policy effects, we believe our weighting method is more appropriate. The oversampling by race/ethnicity is
addressed by adding these variables into the regressions as control variables.
17

We also examined all models reported below using the unweighted YRBS data. For drinking and binge drinking,

point estimates have the same sign, remain statistically significant in most cases, but are somewhat smaller in
absolute value compare with those from the weighted data. Estimates for smoking and marijuana use are not
significantly different from zero. These results are available upon request.

13

The second issue is the potential for sample selection. As mentioned above, some previous
studies show that increases in HSGR may unintentionally raise high-school dropout rates. Since
YRBS data only contains high-school students who were currently enrolled, we need to address
the concern that the effects of HSGR on substance use identified in our study are due to higher
dropout rates of students with riskier behaviors.18 Most studies that use YRBS data do not
explicitly address this issue (Carpenter and Cook, 2008; Anderson, 2010; DeSimone, 2010;
Disney et al., 2013; Xuan et al., 2013; Anderson and Elsea, 2015; Hansen et al., 2015).
However, this selection issue is crucial in this paper because unlike previous studies, in which
the covariates are fairly unlikely to affect the dropout rate, HSGR more plausibly does so.
To examine how important this issue might be to our analysis, we examine the effect of
HSGR on dropout among 14-18 year-olds using a similar set of covariates described above.
This analysis requires the use of another dataset since the YRBS only interviews students; thus,
we use 1990 and 2000 U.S. Census and 2001-2013 American Community Survey (ACS) data.
We code “dropout” as “1” if a 14-18 year-old has had at least some high school education, is
not currently enrolled in school, and does not have a high-school diploma or equivalent. As
with our YRBS analysis, the graduation year is assumed to be the current year if students are
18, one year later if students are 17, two years later if students are 16, etc.19
Table 3 shows the effects of HSGR on dropouts for the whole time period from year 1990

18

One study by Bray et al. (2000) shows that marijuana use is positively related with dropping out from high

school.
19

The ACS does not report the exact month a survey was conducted, making our matching of HSGR less accurate

than in YRBS. We also conducted our analysis assuming the graduation year is year+17-age (with 18 year-olds
dropped from the sample). The results again indicate no effect of HSGR on dropout and are available upon request.

to 2013 (from graduation year of 1990 to 2014) in column (1), for only graduation years up to
and including 2004 in column (2) and for only graduation years after 2004 in column (3). We
do not find evidence that dropout is affected by HSGR over the whole sample period. This
appears to be inconsistent with Lillard and DeCicca (2001) (which uses the 1980 and 1990 U.S.
Censuses) and Plunk et al. (2014) (which uses the 1990 and 2000 U.S. Censuses and the 20012011 ACS data but restricts the sample to those graduating between 1980 and 1999), who find
HSGR has a positive impact on dropout. When we restrict our sample to roughly the first half
of graduating classes (2004 and before), we indeed find a statistically significant (at the 5%
level) positive effect of HSGR on dropout, though it is economically small: a one unit increase
in HSGR raises the likelihood of dropout by 0.2%. This is in line with the estimates in Lillard
and DeCicca (2001) and Plunk et al. (2014), which range from roughly 0.15% to 0.4% for a
comparable change in HSGR. These findings suggest that sample selection due to HSGR’s
effect on dropout is at most very limited during our sample period; furthermore, the difference
in our results and those of previous studies is likely due at least in part to differences in sample
periods across studies.
Carpenter and Stehr (2008) also propose a remedy for the problem of selection due to
school absence by restricting the sample to only students who are 16 or under. Over our sample
period, students were required to stay in school by law until at least 16 years of age in every
state, with many states requiring even longer attendance.20 Using U.S. Census and American

Community Survey data, we calculated school enrollment rates and dropout rates by different
age groups for the years 1990, 2000, and 2010. The results, presented in Tables 4a and 4b, show
clear gaps in the enrollment rates between 16 years old and 17 years old and that dropouts
before age 17 are fairly rare. Although the enrollment rate is not 100% even for younger
individuals, restricting our sample to the younger subgroup mitigates the concern that our
results are being driven by sample selection. Thus, our strategy for dealing with this issue using
YRBS is to only include students who are under 17 in the same regressions as in our main
analysis. We show in Section V that selection due to dropout cannot account for our main
results.
IV. MAIN RESULTS
Tables 5 to 8 show the results of our baseline regressions, with the effects of HSGR on
binge drinking and drinking listed in Tables 5 and 6, and the effects of HSGR on smoking and

in

2013,

see:

https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_234.10.asp). Although in some states, like Florida, students
are allowed to drop out when they turn 16, extra requirements like parents’ consent and filing formal declaration
of intent to terminate school enrollment with the school district are needed if they decide to drop out at age 16,
making it harder than doing so at 17 or older. Source: Florida Department of Education
(http://www.fldoe.org/how-do-i/attendance-enrollment.stml).
It would be useful to control for the effects of the compulsory schooling laws in the regressions. However,
we can only find compulsory schooling law information for every even year during our sample period.
Considering YRBS cohorts are from odd years, matching these two sets of data is problematic. Because of this,
we do not add compulsory schooling law dummies in the baseline regressions or in the main robustness check
regressions. However, we did run the regressions with the nearest year law dummies added later, and the results
are very similar to those without them and are available upon request.

marijuana use listed in Tables 7 and 8, respectively. All models are estimated using OLS with
standard errors clustered at the state level. Column (1) of all four tables shows the results from
models estimated with state and year fixed effects and individual-level controls but without
state-level controls. State-level control variables are added in column (2). Finally, in column
(3), both state-level controls and state-specific linear time trends are included.21
Tables 5 and 6 show consistently negative impacts of HSGR on drinking across all
measures and all subgroups: it decreases the probability of binge drinking and drinking as well
as the number of drinking days and binge drinking days. As for the subgroup results, the
magnitudes of HSGR’s effects on drinking and binge drinking are larger among males than
females and larger among non-white students than white students for every measure and every
specification.
Most results in columns (1) and (2) of Table 5 are statistically significant (at the 10% level
or better), except for the effects on female binge drinking days in column (2) and the effects on
white binge drinking days in both columns. A similar pattern can be seen in Table 6, except that
results for female drinking days and all results for whites are insignificant. The fact that the
inclusion of a rich set of state characteristics does little to affect the HSGR point estimates is
reassuring, since if HSGR were highly correlated with other observable state characteristics
that affect drinking, it might be the case that it was also correlated with unobserved ones as
well.
After adding state-specific linear time trends (column (3)), some results lose significance.

21

We also tried models in which all controls except state, year, and grade fixed effects were removed, and the

results were very similar to those in column (1). These results are available upon request.

17

Point estimates in columns (3) are smaller (usually modestly) in absolute value in most cases
but still remain negative, and standard errors increase. These changes are because the statespecific time trends are correlated with HSGR and thus likely pick up some of the effects of
HSGR in addition to any pre-existing trends across states (Wolfers, 2006). Because of this, the
results after adding state-specific time trends are not necessarily more trustworthy than those
without them. However, it is worth noting that in the cases of both binge drinking behaviors
and number of drinking days, point estimates remain significant at the 10% level or better for
the total sample and non-white students in particular.
Throughout the rest of the paper, we treat the specification shown in column (2) as our
preferred specification, which includes state dummies, year dummies, individual controls and
state controls. Our state level controls include a broad range of factors that other papers in the
HSGR literature have used to control for state-level heterogeneous trends and the possibility
that HSGR changes are made in conjunction with other educational reforms.
Using our preferred specification with the total sample, the point estimates of the effect
of HSGR on “did binge drink in last 30 days” and “did drink in last 30 days” are both -0.016,
meaning that one additional unit in math and science HSGR reduces the probability of both
binge drinking and drinking by 1.6%. These reductions constitute 5.8% of the students who did
binge drink and 3.5% of the students who did drink in our sample.22 For male students, both
estimates are -0.018, constituting 5.8% of males who did binge drink and 3.8% of males who
did drink. For female students, the reductions are 1.4% for binge drinking and 1.3% for

22

These two numbers are calculated as 100*(0.016/0.275) = 5.8 percent for binge drinking and 100*(0.016/0.454)

= 3.5 percent for drinking. Percentage changes discussed below are calculated using the same method.

18

drinking, constituting 5.8% of females who did binge drink and 3.0% of females who did drink.
For white students, one additional unit of HSGR reduces the probability of binge drinking by
1.2%, or 3.7% at the mean; while for non-white students, the reduction is 1.9%, or 8.1% at the
mean. Furthermore, one additional unit of HSGR reduces the probability of drinking of nonwhite students by 2.0%, or 4.7% at the mean.
Tables 5 and 6 also show that one additional unit of HSGR reduces binge drinking days
by 0.120 and drinking days by 0.174 for the total sample, which is a 9.5% drop at the mean in
binge drink days and a 6.4% drop at the mean in drinking days. The estimated declines among
males are 6.7% at the mean in binge drinking and 5.6% at the mean in drinking; while the
estimated declines among non-white students are 10.9% at the mean in binge drinking days
and 7.3% at the mean in drinking days (effects that are insignificant at conventional levels are
not discussed here).23
Table 7 reports the effects of HSGR on smoking and Table 8 on marijuana use. The results
are consistent with the results for drinking regarding the estimated signs but different in terms
of statistical significance. From Table 7, the effect of HSGR on smoking is only significant in
one specification for the total sample (“did smoke in last 30 days”, column (2)). The effects on
males are significant in column (2) for both smoking measures and are larger than those for
females, and the effects on non-white students are significant for “did smoke in last 30 days.”

23

We have also estimated the models for each gender by race grouping. Perhaps due to a smaller sample size for

each group (24,421 white males, 31,689 non-white males, 24,630 white females, and 35,323 non-white females),
the results are not as precisely estimated as our main results. But these results also indicate that the effects of
HSGR are largest among non-white males. These results are available upon request.

19

Based on the results shown in column (2), a one-unit increase in HSGR decreases the likelihood
of smoking in the last 30 days by 1.0% for the total sample and 1.3% for male students and
non-white students, which are equivalent to 4.0% of the total sample who did smoke, 4.8% of
males who did smoke, and 6.2% of non-white students who did smoke. Furthermore, one
additional unit of HSGR reduces smoking days by 0.168 for male students, which is a 4.0%
drop at the mean among this group.
Table 8 shows the effects of HSGR on marijuana use. No results are significant for either
measure of marijuana use among the total sample. The results do suggest that higher HSGR
leads to lower marijuana use among non-white students: a one unit increase in HSGR decreases
the likelihood of marijuana use by 1.5%, or 6.8% of students who did use marijuana; and it
reduces marijuana use occurrences by 0.294, or a 9.1% reduction at the mean among non-white
students).24,25

24

Despite the lack of statistical significance, the estimated signs for marijuana use are consistent with those of

drinking and smoking. This insignificance could come from under-reporting. Although all three substances are
illegal for youth, marijuana use is arguably accompanied with harsher social criticism. Two studies also point out
that people tend to under-report marijuana use (Mensch and Kandel, 1988; Bessa et al., 2010).
25

In addition to drinking, smoking and marijuana use, YRBS also has measures of cocaine use including “did

use cocaine in last 30 days” and “times cocaine used in last 30 days”. It also records the use of heroin,
methamphetamines, and other drugs. But those measures are based on lifetime consumption (instead of
consumption in the past month), which are not suitable for this study. There are 4.5% of high school students who
report using cocaine in the last 30 days. Appendix 5 shows the results with cocaine use as the dependent variable.
YRBS also ask questions about chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip. There are very few students who consume tobacco
in such forms. Nevertheless, we have combined these behaviors with smoking and constructed a variable for
“consumed any tobacco product during the last 30 days (1 if “yes”, 0 if “no”)”. The effects of HSGR on “any
tobacco use” are generally negative but insignificant for the total sample and all subgroups. These results are

20

The results throughout this section suggest that the largest effects of HSGR on risky
behaviors are on male students and non-white students. This is consistent with several facts.
First, since we cannot condition on parental income or neighborhood characteristics, these
results likely indicate that the effects of HSGR are larger for less affluent students attending
poorer schools (since race and ethnicity are strongly correlated with these factors; see Reardon
et al., 2008). This seems plausible given state graduation requirements are more likely to bind
for such students. Furthermore, recent evidence from the HSGR literature find that effects on
course-taking, and later earnings are largest for minority students, particularly males (Goodman,
2017).
V. YOUNGER SUMSAMPLES
As discussed above, we also adopt the approach of Carpenter and Stehr (2008) and restrict
the sample to students who are 16 years old and under to conduct our robustness check. HSGR
may affect younger students’ health behaviors through the time constraint because students
facing higher HSGR tend to enroll in higher level courses from the beginning of high school
(Schiller and Muller, 2003). Since dropout rates are very low for students in this age category,
the results are less likely to be contaminated by sample selection bias due to dropout. All
methods and the control variables remain the same as in the previous section. In our database,
66,527 observations out of 116,063, or 57 percent of the total observations, are under 17 years
old. 56 percent of male students and 59 percent of females are under 17, while 59 percent of
whites and 56 percent of non-whites are under 17.

21

the younger subsample using our preferred specification (column (2) in Tables 5-8). The results
for binge drinking and drinking behaviors are consistent with those in Tables 5 and 6. Nearly
all the estimated signs are negative. Point estimates are typically only slightly smaller in
absolute value compared with those for all ages. Regarding smoking and marijuana use, point
estimates experience a larger reduction in magnitude and loss of significance relative to Tables
7 and 8 (though coefficients generally remain negative for the total sample, males, and nonwhites). This may be due to sample selection as described previously, though given our results
on high-school dropout (Table 3), we believe it is more likely due a combination of true larger
effects for older students and a reduced sample size. Nevertheless, the smoking and marijuana
results should be interpreted with caution, and we place our greatest confidence in the estimated
effects of HSGR on (binge) drinking.26
VI. PLACEBO ANALYSIS
To test the validity of our DID design, we construct a placebo test in this section. The goal
is to mitigate the concern that the trends in risky behavior would have been different between
the treatment states and control states even in the absence of treatment. Traditionally, such tests
are performed under an event-study framework by replacing the treatment variable with cohortspecific dummy indicators (relative to treatment) and examining the effects of each indicator.
However, our data structure prevents us from adopting the typical event study framework,

26

We also examined the robustness of our results by using probit models for binary dependent variables and

ordered probit models for multinomial dependent variables. Regressions are performed both for all students and
those under 17 using our preferred specification, which includes individual controls, state controls, state and time
dummies. The results are consistent with their counterparts in Tables 5 through 8 and are available upon request.

22

because HSGR is a non-binary policy and a substantial number of states (20) changed their
HSGR more than once from 1993 to 2013. Simon (2016) proposes to use only large policy
changes (in his case, excise tax hikes) to reduce the events that are considered to be treatments,
and he limits the sample period to a certain time window to guarantee there is only one discrete
event per state. Unfortunately, this method is not suitable for us given that most HSGR changes
are the same size (1 or 2) and distributed fairly uniformly throughout our sample time frame.
In our placebo test, we construct 10 different placebo HSGR treatments, which are
essentially 6 leads (by shifting the true HSGR 1-6 cohorts forward) and 4 lags (by shifting the
true HSGR 1-4 cohorts backward) of the true HSGR. In other words, by imposing the “𝑛
cohorts ahead (after)” placebo HSGR, students of graduation year 𝑡 are being treated with the
HSGR of graduation year 𝑡 ± 𝑛.27
If our DID method is valid, we expect the effects of these placebo HSGR to be smaller
than the effects of the true HSGR because of mismatching. In addition, the further a placebo
HSGR deviates from the true HSGR, the more severe the mismatch is, and thus the smaller the
effect of the placebo HSGR should be. On the contrary, if the placebo HSGR effects do not
show such a pattern, it would call our identification strategy into question. For example, if the
effects got stronger as the placebo HSGR was shifted forward, we would have reason to believe
that there were different pre-treatment trends between control and treatment groups caused by

27

We choose to use 4 lags because our HSGR data begins with the graduating cohort of 1989, 4 years prior to

our first cohort (graduation year 1993) in the YRBS data. To construct the 6 HSGR leads, for those observations
that would receive a placebo HSGR for a graduation year beyond 2015, we simply assign them the last HSGR
available (graduation year 2015). As illustrated below, with this number of leads and lags, we find that the effects
of (placebo) HSGR diminish as the placebo HSGR gets farther from the true HSGR.

23

unobserved differences between the two, which would mean our baseline estimates of HSGR
on risky health behaviors are likely biased upward (in absolute value).28
We only perform the placebo test on drinking behaviors since these behaviors are most
affected by HSGR in our baseline models. Table 10 shows the effects of placebo HSGR’s on
these behaviors under our preferred specification for the full sample. 𝑛 cohorts ahead (after)
means the placebo HSGR is generated by shifting the true HSGR forward (backward) by 𝑛
cohorts. The effects of the true HSGR are the same as shown in columns (2) of Tables 5 and 6
(full sample) and indeed are stronger than any placebo effect in terms of both magnitude and
significance. The effects of placebo HSGR’s generally get smaller the further they are from the
true HSGR, supporting the validity of our DID design.
VII. CONCLUSION
We study the effects of high-school graduation requirements (HSGR) regarding
mathematics and science on high-school students’ health behaviors, including drinking,
smoking, and marijuana use. We find that an increase in math/science HSGR has significant
negative impacts on the alcohol consumption of high-school students, especially males and
non-white students. These results are consistent with Goodman (2017), who finds the strongest
effects of state math requirements on math course taking and later earnings to be among
minority students. Estimated effects on smoking and marijuana use are consistently negative
though often not statistically different from zero, especially among our younger subsample.

28

It is important to note that our placebo HSGR’s will still pick up some effects of the true HSGR because they

will still partially coincide with the true HSGR, unlike a traditional event-study design in which each cohort/bin
indicator “turns on” just once at a certain cohort/bin. This is one shortcoming of this design.

24

The potential selection issue due to high-school dropout is addressed. We find no evidence
of an effect of HSGR on the probability of high-school dropout using the Census and ACS over
our sample period. Furthermore, restricting our sample to individuals under 17 years old
(among whom enrollment rates are very high), we find very similar results to our main findings
for (binge) drinking behaviors.
There are limitations of our study. Perhaps the most important is that we cannot, with the
data used in this paper, assess which mechanisms contribute to the curbing of risky behavior
when HSGR changes. This is an important subject for future research. We also note the
possibility that missing data/information on some students gives us a distorted view of how
HSGR affects risky behavior for the full high-school population: participation in YRBS surveys
is roughly 70% over our sample period, and about 13% of the observations in the data are
excluded from the regression analysis due to missing information on health behaviors or
covariates. More work is needed to determine how missing values on youth risk behaviors
affect estimates such as the ones in this paper.
Our results have implications for the role education plays in fostering healthy behaviors
and deterring criminal activity (since underage use of alcohol is illegal). Many papers in this
literature rely on differences in compulsory schooling laws by cohort and/or location to identify
the effects of education on health and criminal behavior (Adams, 2002; Lleras-Muney, 2005;
Oreopoulos, 2007; Chou et al., 2010; Machin et al., 2011; Anderson, 2014; Güneş, 2015). There
are two drawbacks to this. The first is that compulsory schooling laws affect the quantity of
schooling (for some youths) but likely have little effect on high-school stringency. Another
drawback is that since treatment effects are identified only for those whose behavior changes
25

in the face of a change in compulsory schooling laws (Angrist and Krueger, 1991), we do not
know how schooling affects risky behaviors for youths who are unaffected by changes in these
laws. Our paper contributes on both fronts by examining how academic stringency (in the form
of higher HSGR) affects behavior, which policy is likely to affect at least some youths who
would have graduated from high school regardless of the compulsory schooling law they face.
As mentioned above, there is empirical evidence suggesting that different substances may
be substitutes among youths. For example, raising the price of alcohol by increasing its excise
tax or raising the minimum drinking age is likely to decrease alcohol consumption but could
increase the consumption of marijuana. Since HSGR is a constraint imposed on time, it does
not seem to induce a shift from one substance to another in this way. Our results suggest that
HSGR could be an attractive policy alternative to curb youth drinking, and that perhaps highschool course requirements or curriculum are an understudied means of discouraging risky
behavior. However, since an increase in HSGR imposes a stricter time constraint, it is possible
that it could reduce students’ sleeping or exercise. The limitation of our dataset prevents us
from examining the effects of HSGR on these health behaviors. Further work could explore
whether the benefits of higher HSGR outweigh its costs overall.

Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS): Version 6.0 [Machine-readable database]. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota,

3. Estimates are obtained using weighted OLS with standard errors (in parentheses) clustered by state. Weights are
generated by IPUMS to indicate how many persons in the U.S. population are represented by a given person. Control
variables include state dummies, individual controls, state level controls, and graduation year dummies. Individual controls
include age, gender, race, and inflation-adjusted family income. State level controls include median income,
unemployment rate, per pupil education spending, pupil-teacher ratio, and a state high school exit exam dummy.
4. Individuals ages 14-18 are included in the regressions. High school dropout is defined as having had some level of high
school education, not being currently enrolled, and not having a high school degree or GED. The graduation year is
assumed to be the current year if students are 18, 1 year later if students are 17, 2 years later if students are 16, etc.

Appendix 1: Compiling Methodology for High School Graduation Requirements
DES publishes HSGR data for the years 1990, 1993, 1996, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2006,
2008, 2011, and 2013, but not for other years within this period. DES also reports the first
graduating class that is affected by a newly implemented HSGR up until 2001 (implementation
of a new HSGR generally comes several years after it is first reported in DES). We compile a
dataset that contains the HSGR students in each state, cohort and grade face from the graduating
class of 1989 to 2015.
For example, DES1996 shows that the math and science HSGR for Alabama is 4 units for
mathematics and 4 units for science. It also documents that the first graduating class for which
these requirements apply is 2000. Thus, the graduating classes before 2000 are not affected by
the HSGR reported in DES1996. To recover the HSGR of the graduating classes prior to 2000,
we need to resort to DES reports before 1996. In DES 1993 we can find previous HSGR
information (2 units for mathematics and 2 units for science) and also the first graduating class
for which the old HSGR applied (in this case the graduating class of 1989). Also, we find that
in DES reports following DES1996, the math and science HSGR of Alabama reported always
remains as “4 units for mathematics and 4 units for science.” This means that for the state of
Alabama we have recovered all relevant HSGR information: for the graduating classes of 1999
and before, the math and science HSGR is 2 units for mathematics and 2 units for science, and
for the graduating classes of 2000 and after, the math and science HSGR is 4 units for
mathematics and 4 units for science. To verify this information, we double-checked our
procedure using each state’s legislation.
Starting in 2002, DES stops reporting the first graduating class for which a new HSGR
48

will apply. As a result, we collect the implementation year data from the state board of
education or department of education of each state when it is unclear from the DES reports.
For example, in the case of Delaware, we have the information about the math and science
HSGR and which graduating class the requirements will impact until 2001 from DES (3 units
in mathematics and 3 units in science). After 2001, although we can still get the information
about math and science HSGR for each year from DES, there is no impact year data from DES.
In this case, we turn to the website of the Delaware Department of Education. In the Delaware
state code “14 Delaware Code, Section 122(d)29”, it is stated:
“2.0 Current Graduation Requirements
A public school student shall be granted a State of Delaware Diploma when such student has
successfully completed a minimum of twenty-two credits in order to graduate including: 4
credits in English Language Arts, 3 credits in mathematics, 3 credits in science, 3 credits in
social studies, 1 credit in physical education, 1/2 credit in health, 1 credit in computer literacy,
3 credits in a Career Pathway, and 3 1/2 credits in elective courses.
3.0 Graduation Requirements Beginning with the Class of 2011 (Freshman Class of 20072008)
3.1 Beginning with the graduating class of 2011, a public school student shall be granted a
State of Delaware Diploma when such student has successfully completed a minimum of twenty
two (22) credits in order to graduate including: four (4) credits in English Language Arts, four
(4) credits in Mathematics; three (3) credits in Science, three (3) credits in Social Studies, one

(1) credit in physical education, one half (1/2) credit in health education, three (3) credits in a
Career Pathway, and three and one half (3.5) credits in elective courses.”
From this state code, we can pin down the exact graduation class for which the new
requirements apply. In this case, starting with the graduating class of 2011, the minimum
required units in mathematics were changed from 3 to 4.
For some states, students are given the option to select different types of diplomas that
have different sets of requirements. For example, Indiana offers students who entered school
before the fall of 2007 two types of diploma (“general” and “core 40”) with two different sets
of requirements. We are unable to separate students who choose the general diploma from those
who choose the “core 40” diploma in YRBS. In this case, we must use our own judgment to
pick a set of requirements that is applied to all students. Our criterion is to choose the least
stringent of the possible sets of requirements (since we are trying to define a minimum course
requirement) unless it is clear that the non-academic requirements associated with the least
stringent set are so onerous that it is unlikely to be a choice for the vast majority of students.
To continue with the example from above, the Indiana General Assembly made
completion of “core 40” a graduation requirement for all students beginning with those who
entered high school in the fall of 2007. Therefore, for the class of 2010 and after, there is only
one unique set of requirements. However, for the class of 2009 and before, there are two sets
of requirements. Here we choose the requirements of the “general” diploma since this is
consistent with the standard diploma requirements of other states. In addition, it is the minimum
graduation requirement one could face.
Another example is Texas. There are 3 different programs: “recommended”, “advanced”,
50

and “minimum”. We choose the “minimum” program requirements for the graduating class of
2007 and before as the their HSGR because it is the minimum requirement. However, for the
class of 2008 and after, we choose the “recommended” program requirements because a newly
implemented law made it very difficult for most students to enroll in the minimum program.
The law requires parents’ consent, age restrictions, and failing to enter grade 10 once as
qualifications for a student to choose the “minimum” program. 30 In this sense, the
“recommended” program appears to be the standard one, which is also consistent with the DES
report.
For the state of South Dakota, the DES reports from different years are inconsistent with
each other, and we could not find additional information from the South Dakota Department of
Education to help correct the information despite our best efforts. As a result, we have to use
DES data without knowledge of the implementation year even after 2001 for South Dakota’s
HSGR.
Our complete compiled dataset of HSGR is given in Appendix 2.

Notes: 1. Source: Education Commission of the States, Clearinghouse Notes. 2.To keep consistency, once a state has double standards for standard graduation requirement and college preparation requirement, we choose standard
graduation requirement. 3. ---: Requirements are made by local board. 4. For FL, there are basically two programs, a traditional 4 years program and a college preparation 3 years program. All requirements for math and science
are the same but the impact year of the newest change for 3-year program is 2010, but for the 4-year program it is 2011. Here we choose 2011 as the impact year in alliance with the spirit of minimum requirements.

2. Expenditures per pupil for public elementary and secondary education. Data for the years
1993-2001 comes from NCES, “A Historical Overview of Revenues and Expenditures for
Public Elementary and Secondary Education, by State: Fiscal Years 1990–2002, Adjusted
current expenditures per pupil for public elementary and secondary education.”

We

then

use

Alcohol

Policy

Information

System

(https://alcoholpolicy.niaaa.nih.gov/taxes_beer.html) to verify the data. All tax rates are the
rates on the first day of each year. Numbers are rounded up to the cent to achieve
consistency of the two datasets. Based on the drinking pattern of youth, using beer taxes to
approximate tax burden for youth alcohol consumption is more accurate than the liquor tax
or wine tax.
8. Medical marijuana legalization year. Medical Marijuana legalization data comes from
ProCon.org.

“23

Marijuana

(http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000881). Most recent
date of access: Aug 20, 2016. Besides medical marijuana legalization, recreational
marijuana legalization will likely to affect youths’ consumption of marijuana. However,
since our YRBS data ends in 2013 and all recreational marijuana legalization laws were
adopted after that year, we do not include them in the regressions.
