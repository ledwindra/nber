    "abstract": "\n\nWe show theoretically that variable production costs lower systematic risk of firms\u2019 cash flows if capital and variable inputs are complementary in firms\u2019 production and input prices are pro-cyclical. In our dynamic model, this operating hedge effect is weaker for more profitable firms, giving rise to a gross profitability premium. Moreover, gross profitability and value factors are distinct and negatively correlated, and their premia are not captured by the CAPM. We estimate the model by the simulated method of moments, and find that its main implications for stock returns and cash flow dynamics are quantitatively consistent with the data.\n\n",
