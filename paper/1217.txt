CORPORATE ?EJSION °OLICY AhID THE VALUE OF PBGC IhIS'iRAhIC

Abstract

This paper derives the value of PBGC pension insurance under two scenarios

of interest. The first allows for

voluntary plan termination, which aooars

to be legal under current statutes. In the

second scenario, termination is

prohibited unless the firm is bankrupt. Optimal

pension funding strategy

under each scenario is examined. Finally, empirical estimates of PBGC

liabilities are calculated. These show that a small number of funds account
for a large fraction of total

prospective PBGC liabilities, that those total

liabilities greatly exceed current PBGC reserves for plan terminations, and
that PBGC liabilities could be substantially reduced by the prohibition of
voluntary termination.

CORPORATE PENSION POLICY AN!) THE VALUE OF PBGC INSURANCE

Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 197'

established the Pension Benefit uarantee Corporation to insure the benefits
of participants of defined-benefit pension plans. The PBGC now insures the
pension benefits of more than 28 million employees in single-employer plans,

and provides less extensive coverage to participants in multi-employer plans.

irms initially were charged a premium of Z1 per year per employee for this
coverage. This premium structure was meant to be temporary, until the data
required to establish an actuarially balanced plan became available. In 1930,

the PBGC raised the premiums to 2.6O per employee per year. In 1932 the °BGC
requested a further increase in the premium rate to 6.OO, and warned that
even this increase will be sufficient to cover prospective PBSC liabilities
only if several currently precarious large plans regain financial

stability.1 This latest request has led to renewed interest in PBGC pricing
policy and the assessment of BGC liabilities. Although the Multieniployer
Pension Plan Amendment Act of 1930 directed the PBGC to study the possibility
of a graduated premium rate schedule based on risk, such recommendations have
yet to he made, and the current proposals for rate changes are still
independent of risk.

One approach to valuing PBGC liabilities is provided by the options

pricing framework. The formal correspondence between put options and term
insurance policies has long been noted and the option pricing methodology has
been used to value insurance plans in other contexts (Mayers and Smith [1977],
Merton [1977], Sosin [1981], Marcus and Shaked [1932]).

In fact several

—3—

authors (Sharpe 1:1976], Treynor [1977], da Motta [1979], Langetieg et al.

[1981]) already have used option pricing methodology to study the valuation of

PBGO insurance. The provisions of ERIS allow firms to transfer their pension
liabilities to the BGC in return for pension fund assets plus 30 percent of
the market value of the firm's net worth. Thus, viewing PBGC insurance as a
put option, the pension liabilities play the role of the exercise price while
the fund assets plus 30 percent of net worth play the role of the underlying
asset or stock price.2

However, while the analogy between put options and the option to terminate
a pension plan appears straightforward, the correspondence between the two is
not at all clear with respect to the effective time to maturity of the pension

put. Taken literally, ERISA rules seem to imply that a firm may terminate an
underfunded plan, transfer its net liability to the PBGC, and reestablish a

new insured plan. Under this reading of the law, firms would immediately
terminate any plan which became underfunded by more than 30 percent of net

worth. The option would have instantaneous maturity and be indefinitely
renewable.

In practice, however, virtually all terminations of underfunded pension

plans occur as a byproduct of corporate bankruptcy. The lac< of voluntary

terminations suggests that there may be hidden costs to termination. Bulow
(1932) suggests that voluntary termination might lead to unfavorable

government treatment in other matters.3 Other observers (e.g., Munnell,
1982) cite damaged labor relations as an implicit cost of termination. This
seems less convincing, however, since the firm may replace the terminated plan

with another plan of equal value. Both employees and employers can gain at
the expense of the PBGC. More explicit costs of termination might arise

—

from legal entanglements. In one widely cited case, the PBGC brought suit to
block the voluntary termination and reorganization of the underfunded pension

plan of AlloyTek. The two sides ultimately settled out of court in 1981, with
the PBGC assuming the underfunded plan and lloyTek agreeing not to establish

a new defined—benefit plan. Instead, the

firm was

allowed to establish a

defined—contribution plan for its employees y buying Individual etirement
Accounts (IRAs) for them (Munell, 198?).

Most authors have chosen to avoid the ambiguity regarding termination
provisions. Treynor (1977) analyzes pension finance using a one-period model,

in which the fund automatically terminates at the end of the period. Sharpe
(1975) also uses a one-period model, which effectively transforms the

termination put into a European option. In a similar vein, da Motta (1979)

assumes an arbitrary finite maturity date. His model allows firms to drop out
of the PBGC insurance program at interim loments when pension funding payments

come due, but the firm cannot exercise the PBGC put until an exogenously given

maturity date (p. 93). Harrison and Sharpe (1982) also study a multiperiod
model in which the PBGC insurance is exercised only at the end of the last

period. Bulow (1931, 1983), Bulow and Scholes (1982) and Bulow, Scholes and
Menell (1982) generally pass over the issue of termination date per Se, and
focus instead on contingent liabilities at termination, whenever that may be.
Finally, Langetieg et al. (1981) consider P3GG

insurance

in a general

multiperiod contingent claims framework, but examine only the qualitative
properties of the insurance, and do not derive a valuation function for the
insurance.

While these models offer several important insights, the issue of the
implicit termination date remains problematic. It is clear that any estimates

—5--

of

the value of °BGC liabilities will be sensitive to the assumed maturity of

the insurance program. The sensitivity of the qualitative conclusions of
these models to the imposition of an exogenous termination date remains an
open question.

This paper presents models of the pension insurance program which also use
the contingent claims methodology, hut which do not impose an exogenous

maturity date on PBGC insurance. The value of PBGC insurance is derived for

two scenarios. In the first, the possibility of corporate ban'ruptcy is ruled
out, and the pension plan is terminated only when that action is value
maximizing for the firm. This scenario is motivated by the opportunity for

profitable termination which ERISA seems to offer firms. The point of
departure for this model is the AlloyTek case, the resolution of which

indicates that a firm can terminate a pension plan with minimum explicit cost

once, but only once. A one-time-only termination provision makes the pension
put formally identical to an infinite maturity American option, which expires

only upon exercise. The cost of termination is the opportunity cost of not
being able to terminate in the future for possible greater benefits. The
termination decision becomes an optimal-timing problem in which the option is

exercised only if it is sufficiently in-the-money. Such a model potentially
can explain the existence of so many underfunded plans which have not yet
terminated without resorting to unspecified implicit costs of termination.
Given the ability of a firm

to

replace the terminated defined-benefit plan

with a defined-contribution plan, it

is

not clear that those costs would be

significant for most firms.
The first model yields an upper bound estimate of the value of PT3GO
insurance because the plan is terminated only when that action is optimal for

—5-

the firm. In contrast, the second model will provide a lower bound on the
value of the PBGC insurance. In this model, an underfunded pension plan may
terminate only at the occurrence of corporate bankruptcy. The motivation for
this approach is twofold: First, it is consistent with the empirical fact
that virtually no solvent firms exercise the pension put. Second, it is
consistent with proposals for pension insurance reform which would disallow
termination

scenario
since

of underfunded plans by solvent firms. The value derived for

should represent a lower bound on the

this

true value of the insurance,

it rules out the possibility for firms to choose a value-maximizing

termination rule. The true value of PBGC insurance should lie between the
valuation bounds generated by these two models.

The models employed in this paper allow for an analysis and valuation of
pension insurance in a model in which plan termination is determined

endogenously. The models also offer a framework for studying corporate
pension funding and investment policy. The implications of these models
confirm and extend those of Bulow (1981) and Harrison and Sharpe (1932), who
analyzed pension funding strategies for plans with a given maturity date.

The next section presents a model of pension insurance. The valuation of
PBGC liabilities are derived for each scenario, risk-rated pension insurance
premium structures are considered, and optimal corporate financial policy is

examined. It is shown that a fund can be significantly underfunded before a
firm would find termination to be a profitable strategy.

Section II presents empirical estimates of the value of PBGC insurance for

a sample of Fortune 100 firms. The results of this Section indicate that the
pension

of

put has significant value for several firms, and that the true value

PBGC liabilities can differ substantially from the common measure of such

—7-.

liabilities, which is accrued benefits less the sum of fund assets plus 30

percent of firm net worth. Finally, the empirical results are used to
evaluate the decrease in PBGC liabilities that would result from the
prohibition

of voluntary terminations by underfunded plans. Section III

I. A MODEL OF PENSION INSURANCE

A. Valuation of PBGC Pension Liabilities:
For

simplicity, I will assume that all accrued benefits are vested and

Voluntary Termination

In

fact, guaranteed benefits typically

account for

90 and 95 percent of vested benefits, while approximately 80 percent

accrued benefits are vested (Amoroso, 1982). This simplification is

necessary to derive analytic solutions below; it should not affect the
qualitative properties of the solution.

Following Bulow, let A denote

value

the value of accrued benefits, F denote the

of assets in the pension fund and .3E denote the firm liability beyond

assets in the pension fund, i.e., 30 percent of net worth. F and E are
measured as market values, while A is the present value

of accrued benefits

calculated by discounting at the riskiess nominal interest rate. The benefits
represent an obligation

which will be paid

with certainty, either by

the

firm

or the PBGC.

At a termination, if the plan is sufficiently funded (F+.3E >

A),

the firm

gains F and transfers assets of value A to the PBGC. Otherwise, the firm is

liable only up to the amount F.3E. The net proceeds to the firm at
termination therefore equal4

-8-

F -

(1)

min(A, F.3E)

or equivalently,
F-A +

max[A—(F.3E),

(2)

0].

Expression (2) highlights the nature of the firm's put option. Its net
pension liability is F-A; however, it can default on that obligation and
transfer its liability of A to the PBGC in return for only F+.3E.

There is no explicit maturity date associated with the insurance plan. In
this sense, it is isomorphic to an merican put option with infinite maturity
and exercise price A. Just as the put can be exercised only once, the firm
can

voluntarily terminate just one defined-benefit plan. Thereafter, it may

offer

its employees only defined-contribution plans. These plans are akin to

mutual funds. They neither require nor recieve PBGC insurance. Part of the
firm's problem will be to choose a rule for voluntary termination which, in

conjunction with its other policies, maximizes firm

value.

To solve for the value of the pension insurance it is

specify

first necessary to

the dynamics for accrued liabilities and the assets backing the plan.

These will differ from conventional specifications because of the effects of
firm contributions to the pension fund and the effects of new retirees and
deaths on the dynamics for P.

For convenience, use S to denote the sum ÷.3E.

I will assume that S

follows the diffusion process
dS

where

(Cs+as)Sdt +

s5s

is the rate of firm contributions into the pension fund net of

payments to retirees expressed as a fraction of S, and where

equity,

if firm

funding for accruing benefits exceeds payouts from the pension fund for

current retirees., In a steady state with no uncertainty, a constant interest
rate, and a constant number of retirees, the present value of accrued benefits

would be constant over time. A firm administering a fully funded plan could
withdraw

interest earnings from the plan to help it pay benefits to current

retirees and still maintain full funding. In this case, new contributions
into

the plan would fall short of payouts to retirees by the amount of the

interest earnings; C would be negative. In fact if 30 percent of the
firm's equity were not included in the assets hacking the fund, C would

equal the negative of the interest rate. irm contributions would fall short
of current payouts by interest earnings on fund assets, which as a fraction of
assets would simply be the interest rate.

The dynamics for A are more complicated. As a base case, consider a
situation

in which none of the firm's employees h3ve yet retired and in which

no further pension benefits will accrue. If the interest rate, r, is
constant, then the present value of accrued benefits,

price

A,

which is the exercise

of the pension put, will increase at the constant proportional rate r.

The growth in the exercise price derives from the definition of A as a present
value, and differs from the more conventional situation in which the exercise
price is specified as a dollar amount.

If long-term interest rates are stochastic, then so will be the present

value of accrued benefits. Denote by

the expected rate of return on a

bond with a payoff stream identical to that of accrued benefits. This will
also be the expected growth rate in the present value of al ready accrued
benefits.

If interest rates were nonstochastic then

would equal r.

Demographics also affect the evolution of A. Accrued benefits increase

-10-

-

when current workers increase their length of employment and decrease when

plan participants die or have benefits paid to them. In a steady state with
no

uncertainty, and a

constant level of accrued

benefits, newly accruing

benefits plus the increase in the present value of already accrued benefits

would exactly offset the decrease in total accrued benefits due to retiree

deaths. Denoting the net growth rate in accrued benefits attributable to
demographic factors as CA, the total growth rate in
in

the steady state, C would equal -r and

A

would be CA+r. Thus

would remain constant. The

evolution of A can then he sum!narized by the process

The stochastic component of () is due to uncertainty regarding long-term
interest rates and the future pattern of additional net accruals.

I will

denote the correlation coefficient between dzA and dz5 as o.

Following the analysis in Merton (197), and letting P(A,S) denote the
value of the pension put, one can show that P must satisfy the partial

These conditions are derived by solving the quadratic equation which is
generated by substituting (5) into (5). Choosing K to maximize the value of
the option results in the condition
(7

Equation (6) gives the value of the PBGC insurance plan (under the

simplifying assumption of no bankruptcy). Given estimates of the parameters
in (6) and (7) one could assess the value of the insurance to the shareholders

of the firm. These values could serve as the basis for a risk-rated premium
structure. Two such structures are discussed below in Section D.
Equation (7) gives the condition for voluntary termination of the pension

plan. Second order conditions require that C<l. One must further restrict C

to

be negative since a feasible K* must be positive because

and S are

always positive). Thus, C<O, which implies O<K*<l so that the put will be
exercised only for S<A, i.e., if fund assets plus 30 percent of net worth fall

below accrued benefits. Parameters which result in non-negative values for
would imply that the option would never be exercised.3

_12

Equations (5) and (7) generalize the formula for the perpetual American

put option presented in Merton (1973). In the special case that A is
nonstochastic, that C=O and CA=_r (which offsets the growth in A due to
the time value of money and thereby causes the dollar value of the "exercise
price", A, to be constant), e

equals -2r/a2 and (5) reduces to Merton's

equation (52).

A.1 Comparative Statics
It is possible, although tedious, to show analytically that the value of
the termination option increases with 0A and decreases with Cs.

Conversely, the ratio of S/A at which it is optimal to terminate falls with

CA and increases with C. The intuition for these results is
straightforward: when the gap between the growth rates of accrued benefits
and the assets backing those benefits (S =

F.3E)

increases, the expected

profits from a future exercise of the put option increase and the value of

waiting to exercise correspondingly increases. These results are illustrated
in Table 1, in which optimal ratios, K* =

(S/A)*,

for pension termination and

the value of the pension put are presented for various values of 0A and

C5 and for an interest rate of .10 and a variance rate of .05g. Recall
that the certainty equivalent drifts in A and S are respectively r +
r +

C.

C and

Therefore the parameters presented in Table 1. correspond to

combinations of sustained growth rates of -.08 to .06.
The put values in the second panel are calculated assuming that A = S =

1.0.

Therefore these entries may be interpreted as the value of the pension

insurance as a fraction of total asset value when the pension put is exactly
at-the-money, i.e., when the total assets backing the pension fund

obligations equal the present value of those obligations. emember, however,

—13-.

that this condition does not correspond to full funding of the pension fund

since S includes the contingent liability of the firm of .3E. Of course,
formula (6) could be used to generate actuarially fair values of the
insurance for any initial values of A and S.

The table demonstrates that the value of the termination put can be sub-

stantial. As a base case, the zero drift configuration of CA and
gives a pension put value of 18 percent of the value of accrued liabilities.

Therefore even fully funded plans (where funding includes the firm's

contingent liability of .3E) can pose significant risk to the PBGC. When Cr
+

Cs) is negative (i.e., when pension assets are being depleted because of

payments to retirees) or when Cr ÷

CA)

is

positive,

pension insurance

values increase dramatically.
It is interesting to note that when CA =

C

=

0,

e=O and the pension

put will never he terminated. In this case, the "exercise price," A, is:
growing at an expected rate equal to its cost of capital;: therefore, in

contrast to the standard put option, waiting to exercise does not impose a
time value of money cost.

The table also can be used to examine the effects of equal changes in

Cs and CA. Reading down the diagonals from top left to bottom right
demonstrates that the optimal voluntary termination ratio decreases for

larger (algebraic) values for these growth rates. The value of the pension
put correspondingly increases. These results derive from the effect of scale
on the termination decision. If a pension fund is increasing in size (large
positive CA,CS), then the dollar gain from a termination for any given
ratio of S/A is

larger.

If the fund is growing, it pays to wait to

terminate, and the ratio S/A must be smaller to induce early termination.

—11.—

Thus, one should expect termination decisions to be more frequent in
declining industries in which pension funds are shrinking. These results
also

can be verified analytically: Equal (algebraic) increases in C and

C always increase the value of P(A, S) and lower the termination ratio, K*.

Corporate

pension Funding Policy

Bulow (1981) and Harrison and Sharpe (1982) examine

policy

pension funding

in a model with taxes and with an exogenous termination date. They

conclude

that a firm should fund its plan either to the maximum or the

minimum level permitted. This razor's edge characteristic is also a property
of the voluntary termination model.
To confirm this point, compute the first and second derivatives of (A,S)
with respect to pension funding, S:

=

(l-K)S1AK

= -[K/(S/A)]
ss

c(c1)(1-K)

(B)

S2K

> 0

where the final form of equation (8) is obtained

(9)

by substituting for c from

(7). From (B), for any nonterminated plan (i.e., K<S/A), we have that
so that each dollar contributed reduces the insurance value by

less than 1 dollar, and by (9), each successive dollar contributed reduces

the insurance value by progressively smaller amounts. In contrast, the
marginal tax shield arising from contributions to the pension fund is
independent of the level of current funding (Black [1980], Tepper [1981]).

—15—

Therefore, the firm will always be forced to a corner solution: t any
interior point, if one dollar of extra funding results in an incremental tax
shield which exceeds the marginal decrease in the value of pension insurance,

then so must the next dollar contribution and so on. Conversely, if
marginally decreased funding is optimal in the interior, then so must be

further decreases until some statutory limit is reached. See figure 1.
Bulow (1982) has argued that accrued benefits rather than projected
benefits

is the relevant variable for assessing corporate pension

liabilities. The approach taken in this paper leads to an intermediate
position

in this debate. Although it is true that at a termination, the

firm's liability is only accrued benefits, the model shows that in the
presence of PBGC insurance, projected benefits (as represented by CA)

influence the decision to terminate as well as the present values of both
°BGC and firm liabilities.

B. PBGC Liabilities with Termination Only at Bankruptcy
When the pension plan terminates only if the firm is bankrupt, the firm
loses the special put option conveyed by the current pension insurance

system. Instead, at bankruptcy, the PBGC simply assumes the pension fund.
The value of the PBGC liability will depend in general upon the exact
conditions which set off a bankruptcy.

I will assume that bankruptcy is

declared when the value of the firm, V. falls below the present value of the
debt obligations of the firm where that value is computed under the

assumption that the obligations will be fully met. (This notion of debt,
rather than market value, is the appropriate one because limited liability

assures that the market value of debt can never exceed V). Although this

termination, the obligation of the PBGC equals A — S = (1 — K)A. Before
termination, the insurance is worth P(A,S) . The tangency at S = KA is
the termination point.

The present value of tax savings from pension funding increases with
funding, or, holding E fixed, with S. The present value of tax savings
is proportional to the level of funding.

The total increment to firm value is maximized at either the minimum
or maximum permitted funding levels.

—16—

definition of bankruptcy is at odds with the technical definition that a firm
fails to meet a coupon or principal payment, it still seems a useful way to

model bankruptcy for the present purpose. Firms in practice have several
overlapping debt issues outstanding with associated sinking fund covenants

which would make the modelling of bankruptcy in a legal context exceedingly

complex and firm-specific. Economic insolvency is a more straightforward
approach.

Denote

by D the present value of debt obligations computed by discounting

at the riskless-in-tey,ns-of_default interest rate. Then insolvency occurs at

The PBGC's claim to 30 percent of firm net worth is irrelevant in this

instance, since at bankruptcy, when V<D, equity has no value.

Optimal corporate pension funding policy in the hankruptcy-only model

resembles that in the voluntary termination model. The partial derivative of
P(D,V,F,A) with respect to the funding level, F, is simply -(DIV)9. which is

independent of F. Thus, we again obtain a razor's edge property: If /V is
sufficiently small, then the tax benefits of additional funding will dominate
the

transfer

of wealth to the PBGC and the firm will fund to the statutory

limit. Otherwise, minimal funding will be value-maximizing.

C.

The General Case
A general treatment of PBGC insurance would allow for termination either

at the first occurrence of a voluntary termination point or at the first

occurrence of corporate bankruptcy. s a general rule, however, there is no
closed form solution for the value of PBGC pension insurance in this mixed

case. The difficulty arises from the effects of debt on the variance rate of
the firm's equity. Geske (197'fl has shown that the variance rate evolves

stochastically in this situation. Because the assets hacking pension
benefits, S, include 30 percent of firm net worth, G

in

equation (5) could

no longer be taken as a fixed parameter, and the solution for the value of the

pension insurance consequently would need to be modified. This effect,
together with the fact that termination can result from either of two

conditions, appears to make a numerical solution technique necessary. Even
the numerical approach presents difficulties, however, since the problem would
involve four state variables: A, S, V, and 0.

Jotwithstanding these complications, equations (5) and (10) still can be

of use in valuing PBGC liabilities. (5) should be an upper bound on the value
of pension insurance, since that valuation formula was derived using the

-.19—

termination rule which maximizes the value of the insurance. In contrast, the
termination

only—at--bankruptcy model provides a lower bound on the value of

the insurance. ror firms that are financially healthy but which have severely
underfunded plans, (3) will be a close approximation to the true insurance
value.

In contrast, for firms near bankruptcy, (10) will be fairly accurate.

tn practice, underfunded plans are associated with financially troubled
firms. Therefore, the true value of the PBGC insurance falls somewhere in the
interior of the valuation bounds. The models provide some clues as to why
troubled firms should tend to maintain underfunded plans. One possibility is
that such firms have low marginal tax rates due to loss carry-forward
provisions, and therefore derive less tax benefit from pension funding.

Another explanation is that underfunding the pension plan represents a source
of implicit financing cheaper than that available in outside credit markets.
This advantage will be greatest for firms with the highest borrowing rates.

Finally, if bankruptcy causes the firm to forfeit the pension assets to the
?BGC, overfunding of the plan would create a potential ban'ruptcy cost to

which troubled firms would be more sensitive. This effect was made explicit
in Section B in which it was shown that firms with large values of 0/V will
find that minimal funding is value-maximizing.

0. Risk-Rated Premiums

The

valuation equations derived in Sections A and B provide the present

value of PBGC liabilities under different scenarios. They do not, however,
provide explicit means to calculate fair annual premium rates for pension

insurance. Because fund termination dates are stochastic, the premium annuity
which has an ex ante present value equal to the present value of 0BGC

-20-

obligations cannot be easily calculated. One approach which might provide a

reasonable approximation to the fair premium rate would he to first calculate
the expected value of the time to termination, and then calculate the annuity
appropriate to the present value of PBGC obligations using a horizon equal to

the expected time until termination and an interest rate equal to that paid on
the

firm's outstanding debt.

different approach would require ex post settling up. t the start of
each period, the present value of PBGC obligations would be calculated. At
period end, that value would be recalculated, and the firm would pay (or be

paid) the change in the value of PBGC liabilities. The advantage of this
scheme is that it eliminates most of the moral hazard problems involved in

prespecified rate structures. Any increase in risk would induce increased
premiums. The firm would always pay a fair price for its pension-put option
(or for its limited liability in the bankruptcy model) and would thus lose the
ability and the incentive to underfund at the expense of the PBG(.

II. Empirical Estimates

Pensions and Investment Age (July ii, 1933) reports pension fund
statistics derived from the 1982 annual reports of the Fortune 100 companies.

The survey includes pension fund assets, vested benefits, and the assumed

interest rate used to derive the present value of vested benefits. This
information can be used for this sample of firms.

The survey expresses pension fund assets as market values. The market
value of vested benefits can be approximated by multiplying the reported value
of benefits by the ratio of the plan's assumed interest rate to the actual

long-term market interest rate for 1932. This adjustment assumes that pension

—21.—

benefit

payout streams have time paths similar to perpetuities. The average

rate on 30-year U.S. government obligations in 1982 was 12.76 percent. The
market value of equity is easily derived from stock market data at year-end
1982,

and total firm value can he approximated as equity plus book value of

long-term debt.

I will calculate the value of PBGC insurance for 3 scenarios:

a steady state scenario, for which there is no expected growth in pension fund
assets or liabilities, a growth scenario, in which a 5 percent long-term
growth rate is assumed, and a declining industry scenario involving a negative
5 percent growth rate.

The remaining inputs required to estimate the value of ?BGC

the variance and covariance rates on
the

insurance are

underlying securities. Table 2 presents

values assigned to these variables. These values are meant to be

reasonable guesses only. The low variance rates on A and 0 and high

correlation between the two reflect their similar natures as nominal
liabilities. The variance rates on firm value and pension fund assets compare

to a historical value for the SP50O of approximately .05 annually. The
variance rate for V is derived by unlevering the SP500 variance using a

debt-to-value ratio of 1/3 and then by doubling that variance to account for

the lack of diversification of a single stock relative to the index. The
variance rate on fund assets is set equal to that on the SP500. The fund is

probably less well diversified than the index but this effect is offset by
debt held in the fund.
Tables 3a and 3b present estimates of the value of BGC insurance for 37
of the Fortune 1.00 firms. Thirteen observations were lost because of missing

data. Table 3a presents results based on the 12.75 precent yield on 30-year
T-bonds during 1982, while Table 35 uses a 10 percent interest rate. Columns

.22...

I and 2 of the tables are the present value of vested benefits for each plan,

and the level of overfunding of each plan, respectively. 'olumns 3-S are the
ratios of the value of PBGC insurance to vested benefits for the voluntary
termination scenario and the bankruptcy-only scenario under the 3 assumptions

for the growth rate of the olan. These ratios can be interpreted as the
fraction of pension benefits which are financed (in present value terms) by

the PBGC. The ratios thus give a measure of the PBGC subsidy per dollar of
pension benefits.

The results in the appendices are consolidated in Tables 4 and 5. Table 4
presents summary statistics and Table 5 presents frequency distributions for

the insurance values. The most striking feature of the results is the
skewness of the insurance values, which is revealed in Table 5. Most plans
are sufficiently overfunded as to pose almost no termination risk to the

PBGC. However, a small number of "problem firms" derive considerable value
from the pension insurance. These tend to he the larger firms: the weighted
averages of the insurance values are substantially greater than the means. In
fact for the bankruptcy-only cases, the simple mean of the insurance values is
negative even for r = 10 percent while the weighted average is positive. The
negative values reflect my assumptions that if an overfurided plan terminates

because of firm bankruptcy, the PBGC inherits the plan surplus, and so can
have a negative liability.

As expected, PBGC liabilities are extremely sensitive to the interest rate
used in calculating vested benefits. Table 4 shows that insurance values in
the voluntary termination scenario are more than twice as large for a 10
percent interest rate as they are for the actual 1982 rate of 12.76 percent.
Average insurance values in the bankruptcy-only scenario become positive as

—23—

the interest rate falls to 10 percent. This reflects the sharp increase in
the

present value of benefits. The total underfunding of all underfunded

pension plans rises from $.48 billion to M.47

billion

as the interest rate

falls.
Consistent with the comparative statics results above, the value of
pension insurance tends to rise with the assumed growth rates in A, S and .

Insurance values in the voluntary termination scenario more than triple as
growth rates increase from -.05 to .05. As noted earlier, this tendency
reflects the effect of scale on insurance value. cor growing funds, firms can
increase

the insurance value by delaying termination until a larger dollar

gain can he realized.
The total values of PBGC insurance for the 87 firms are also presented in
Table 4.

The magnitudes of these numbers are quite impressive. Total

insurance

values for the voluntary termination scenario are between 1.25 and

3.6 billion dollars using the 12.76 percent rate and between 3.8 and U)
billion dollars using a 10 percent rate. These values compare with PBGC
reserves for insured future benefits of only 1.14 billion (PBGC nnual

Report, fiscal year 1982). Therefore, if the option to terminate voluntarily
is to be taken seriously, the PBGC reserve calculations are wildly

optimistic. The insurance values for individual firms also differ from the
traditional

measure of underfunding (A-F-.3E) by wide margins, and highlight

the pitfalls of ignoring the option component of pension insurance in
assessing PBGC liabilities. The bankruptcy-only insurance values are, as
expected, far more favorable. In fact, for the higher interest rate, firms
are sufficiently overfunded to drive aggregate net liabilities below zero. As
interest rates decline, the ?BGC is again at great risk although even in this
case,

—2 —

PBGC

liabilities would be halved by a reform in ERIS prohibiting voluntary

termination. The steady state (zero growth) insurance value at a 10 percent
rate is Z2.54 billion. Keep in mind that these insurance values are summed
over only the 37 firms in the sample. PBGC liabilities for all insured firms
must be significantly greater.

III. Conclusion
This paper derives the value of PBGC pension insurance liabilities under

two scenarios of interest. The first scenario allows for voluntary plan
termination, which appears to be legal under current statutes. The second is
a

termination only-at-bankruptcy scenario, which has been

proposed as a reform

to current law. Optimal pension fund financing decisions are examined;
extreme pension funding policies are shown to he optimal in both settings.

This result corroborates and generalizes those of earlier authors. inally,
empirical estimates of PBGC liabilities are derived. These show that a small
number of funds account for a large fraction of total prospective PB(C

liabilities, and that those total liabilities far exceed current reserves for
plan termination.

2. A put option gives its owner the right to sell to the issuer of the option
share of stock at a prespecified price (the exercise price) regardless of

the actual price of the stock. Thus, if the stock price, S, falls below
the exercise price, X, exercise of the option yields a profit of '<

- S.

Similarly, PBGC insurance gives firms the right to "sell" the assets of
the

plan plus 30 percent of net worth to the PBGC at a "price" equal to

the present value of pension liabilities. The gain to the firm

equals

the

pension liabilities it transfers to the PBGC less the assets the PBGC

Bulow cites Chrysler as an example of a firm for which the potential costs
of

a termination could be large if it affected the willingness of the

government to participate in a

bail-out

scheme for the company. Such

extreme examples are probably rare, however.

CA This might be unrealistic: Bulow and Scholes (1982) cite an example
of a terminating fund in which the surplus was split between the firm and

its employees. However, this issue is of limited relevance for this
paper. The PBGC is unconcerned with termination of overfunded plans and
presumably would not block the establishment of a new fund. Overfunded

-25-

plans are not terminated in order to escape liablities and so fall outside
of the scope of this paper.

1 assume that
analytic

is constant. This assumption is necessary to derive

solutions below. However, it is unrealistic to the extent that

firms with underfunded plans are forced to increase funding rates. In

this case, C would be a function of the funding status, and would
evolve stochastically. Numerical techniques would he required to compute
the value of pension insurance.

6.

I will treat

as a constant. This treatment is appropriate when the

firm has no debt outstanding other than its pension liabilities (Geske,

1979). Thus, this specification is

suitable

for the voluntary termination

model, but would need to he modified for the more general case in which
the firm can go bankrupt.

1 will assume that no dividends are paid out by

the firm, and that all dividends received by the pension fund are
reinvested in the fund, so that aS may be equated with the expected rate
of return on the assets backing the pension liabilities.

7. This condition does not necessarily imply that the firm's goal is to
maximize the value of the pension option. It implies only that
conditional on other decisions, the termination rule is option-value

maximizing. For example, in some situations, tax considerations may lead
a

firm to pursue pension funding policies that reduce the value of the

pension put. Nevertheless, the termination rule must maximize the value

of the put given that funding policy.

The insurance policy could have infinite value in this case.

or example,

for large 0A and C=0, the option would provide a claim on a payoff
that would be growing faster than the rate of interest. The value would
be infinite although the option would never be exercised. Obviously, one
would not observe values of (constant)
singular

leadinq to these

cases.

rounded down to account for the fact that pension funds hold some debt in

their portfolios. The entries in Table 1 were not extremely sensitive to
changes in

10. According to this specification, the PBGC would gain by the bankruptcy of
a

firm with an overfunded pension plan, since it would

ownership

simply inherit

of that plan. There seems to be some uncertainty as to the

procedures that actually would be followed in such a circumstance, since
in practice, bankrupt firms have had underfunded plans.
