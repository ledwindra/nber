Our key cross-sectional finding is that the impact of monetary policy on lending behavior is significantly more pronounced for banks with less liquid balance sheets -- i.e., banks with lower ratios of cash and securities to assets.  Moreover, this result is entirely attributable to the smaller banks in our sample, those in the bottom 95% of the size distribution.  Among other things, our findings provide strong support for the existence of a lending channel\n\n",
