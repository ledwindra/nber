AIDS Treatment and Intrahousehold Resource Allocations: Children's Nutrition and Schooling
in Kenya

NBER Working Paper No. 12689

ABSTRACT
The provision of life-saving antiretroviral (ARV) treatment has emerged as a key component of the
global response to HIV/AIDS, but very little is known about the impact of this intervention on the
welfare of children in the households of treated persons. We estimate the impact of ARV treatment
on childrens schooling and nutrition outcomes using longitudinal household survey data collected
in collaboration with a treatment program in western Kenya. We find that childrens weekly hours
of school attendance increase by over 20 percent within six months after treatment is initiated for the
adult household member. For boys in treatment households, these increases closely follow their reduced
market labor supply. Similarly, young childrens short-term nutritional statusas measured by their
weight-for-height Z-scorealso improves dramatically. We argue that these treatment effects will
be considerably larger when compared to the counterfactual scenario of no ARV treatment. The results
provide evidence on how intrahousehold resource allocation is altered in response to significant health
improvements. Since the improvements in childrens schooling and nutrition at these critical early
ages will affect their socio-economic outcomes in adulthood, the widespread provision of ARV treatment
is likely to generate significant long-run macroeconomic benefits.

1. Introduction
Health and education are widely recognized as two important dimensions of human capital,
offering high economic returns and capable of improving prospects for economic development
(among others, see Schultz and Tansel, 1997; Schultz, 1999; Strauss and Thomas, 1998; Duflo,
2001 for evidence from developing countries). The threat posed to children’s human capital is
among the most negative and far-reaching consequence of AIDS-related morbidity and mortality
in sub-Saharan Africa.1 While the provision of life-saving antiretroviral (ARV) treatment has
emerged as a central part of the medical and policy response to HIV/AIDS,2 very little empirical
research has investigated the impacts of this important intervention on children’s welfare. The
long-term macroeconomic consequences of HIV/AIDS and treatment in afflicted countries
depends critically on our understanding of these intergenerational effects (Bell, Gersbach, and
Devarajan, 2003; Young, 2005). Such information also lies at the heart of the debate about the
merits of prevention versus treatment policies (Canning, 2006). This paper is, to our knowledge,
the first to estimate the impact of ARV treatment for adults on the welfare of children living in
their households.
Children living in households with HIV-infected adults are likely to be affected by both
the morbidity and mortality that is associated with AIDS. First, since untreated AIDS is fatal,
many children will become orphaned. A growing empirical literature shows that orphaned
children in Africa suffer major setbacks in their schooling in the years before and after they lose
their parents (Evans and Miguel, 2005; Yamano and Jayne, 2005; Case and Ardington, 2005).
There is also evidence that the long-run health of orphans is negatively affected (Beegle, De
Weerdt, and Dercon, 2005).

Second, the morbidity associated with AIDS may lead to

reallocations of time and resources within the household.

These reallocations can be an

important consumption-smoothing mechanism in low-income settings with imperfect credit and
insurance markets, and several studies have documented their use in response to other health and
income shocks (see, for example, Pitt and Rosenzweig, 1990; Strauss and Thomas, 1995;
Kochar, 1995; and Jacoby and Skoufias, 1997). In the case of AIDS, the health and income
1

In sub-Saharan Africa, roughly 12 million children under the age of 18 have lost one or both parents due to AIDS
(UNAIDS, 2005).
2
The World Health Organization reports that as of December 2005, 810,000 HIV-positive individuals were
estimated to be receiving ARV treatment in sub-Saharan Africa (WHO, 2006). However, this number represents
only 17 percent of the 4.7 million HIV-positive individuals who currently need treatment.

‘shock’ is both large and, absent treatment, permanent, implying that children’s time allocation
patterns could be altered to a greater extent than they would be in response to transitory shocks.
Adults in poor health typically require considerable amounts of care from household
members, including children. The diminished productivity of sick adults will have income and
substitution effects that hasten the participation of children in income-generating activities. The
additional time spent by children on either of these activities is likely to come, at least partly, at
the expense of schooling. Moreover, since the marginal productivity of children who expand
their labor force participation in response to family illness is less than that of a healthy adult,
family income will fall.3 This reduction in income may lead to reduced household consumption,
thereby compounding the education effects and increasing the risk of malnourishment by
lessening children’s access to food.4 ARV treatment, which dramatically improves patient health
and market labor supply (Thirumurthy, Graff Zivin, and Goldstein, 2005), has the potential to
reverse these impacts of AIDS-related morbidity and mortality.
As such, this paper should also be viewed as a significant contribution to the more
general economic literature on intrahousehold resource allocation decisions, shedding light on
how households respond to the negative consequences of disease as well as the positive ones due
to treatment. There is a significant literature in development economics on how households
manage resources to cope with permanent and temporary shocks. The literature focuses on
mechanisms such as informal insurance, credit, and intrahousehold reallocation of consumption
and production.5 In this paper, we provide some evidence of the significant effects of the shock
of AIDS on household education and consumption decisions. The introduction of treatment, in
turn, allows us to examine the sensitivity of these adjustments to the patient’s recovery,
providing an opportunity to assess the extent to which these coping strategies result in
irreversible changes. Together, they deepen our understanding of intrahousehold dynamics and
human capital formation in the developing world.

3

A large theoretical and empirical literature examines the role of income and substitution effects in individual time
allocation decisions (beginning with Becker, 1965) and family labor supply (beginning with Ashenfelter and
Heckman, 1974).
4
Recent research has also established strong linkages between the nutrition of children and their current as well as
future schooling outcomes (Alderman, Behrman, Lavy, and Menon, 2001; Glewwe, Jacoby, and King, 2001;
Glewwe and King, 2001; Miguel and Kremer, 2004).
5
See for example Paxson, 1992; Udry, 1994; Townsend, 1994; Kochar, 1999; Duflo, 2003; and Case and Deaton
1998.

The empirical work in this paper is based on a household survey we conducted in
collaboration with an ARV treatment program in western Kenya. Over the course of one year,
longitudinal socio-economic data were collected from HIV-positive adult patients who had AIDS
and received free ARV treatment. The survey data include information on the schooling and
nutritional outcomes of children residing in the patients’ households. We examine changes over
time in these outcomes, focusing on the school enrollment and school hours attended of children
between the ages of 8-18 years and the anthropometric status of children under the age of 5
years. The effect of ARV therapy on children’s outcomes is identified by examining outcomes at
several points in time, both before and after adults in the children’s households receive treatment.
Using data collected simultaneously from a large random sample of non-patient households in
the survey area, we control for time-varying factors that could bias the estimates. The approach
is tantamount to a difference-in-difference estimation strategy in which the treatment group
consists of children in households of ARV recipients and the comparison group consists of
children in the survey area.6 The longitudinal aspect of the survey data and the random sample
of households in the community are critical for identifying the effect of treatment. As we discuss
below, our identification strategy is also strengthened by variation in the length of time that adult
patients had been receiving treatment prior to the start of the survey.
The results in this paper indicate that treating adult AIDS patients with ARV treatment
results in substantial improvements in the welfare of children living with the patients. Our
primary result indicates that there is a significant increase in the children’s weekly hours of
school attendance. These increases generally occur within six months after treatment is initiated
for adult patients, and they are experienced by boys and girls living with the patients. Our main
results imply that weekly school hours attended rise by over 20 percent during this period, with
boys experiencing an even larger rise of 30 percent. After nine months of treatment, the
increases in school attendance are maintained with no significant drop off over the time period of
our study. Moreover, we find that for boys in particular, the increase in hours of attendance is
almost exactly equal to the treatment-driven decrease in their hours of market labor supply.
The treatment effect is considerably larger when we compare children in treatment
households to orphans in the random sample.
6

This suggests that pre- and post-treatment

Given the clinical effectiveness of ARV therapy, the construction of a randomly chosen control group of children
living with HIV-positive adults who are medically qualified for ARV treatment but do not receive it is ethically
infeasible.

3

comparisons that do not consider the “no treatment” or counterfactual scenario of children
becoming orphaned may underestimate the full impact of ARV treatment on schooling
outcomes.

Furthermore, this provides reassurance that the lack of a counterfactual group

comprised of children in households with untreated adult AIDS patients does not produce an
overestimate of the treatment impact in our empirical analysis.7 Finally, we find that the shortterm nutritional status of young children in adult patients’ households improves significantly,
also within six months after treatment is initiated for the patients. These gains in nutritional
status can be expected to improve the physical and cognitive abilities of children and eventually,
their post-school productivity levels. Together these results serve as evidence that there are
substantial long-term benefits from providing ARV treatment.
The next section provides background on the treatment intervention that we study, as well
as the household survey data. This is followed by a discussion in Section 3 of our strategy for
estimating the impact of ARV treatment on children’s outcomes. Regression results showing the
effect of treatment on children’s schooling and nutrition are presented in Sections 4 and 5,
respectively. Section 6 concludes and discusses policy implications of this research.

2. Background and Data
This paper uses data from a household survey that we conducted in Kosirai Division, a rural
region near the town of Eldoret, in western Kenya. The survey has been described in detail in
Thirumurthy, Graff Zivin, and Goldstein (2005). In this section, we provide a brief review of the
literature on ARV treatment followed by an overview of the survey and details on the schooling
and nutrition data.
2.1. Treatment of HIV/AIDS with Antiretroviral Therapy
Almost all HIV-infected individuals experience a weakening of the immune system and progress
to developing AIDS. This later stage is very often associated with substantial weight loss
(wasting) and opportunistic infections such as pneumonia and tuberculosis. Once individuals
develop AIDS, death is highly imminent without treatment. Median survival times are estimated
to be between 5.1 months and 9.2 months (Chequer et al., 1992; Morgan et al., 2002).
Opportunistic infections are generally the cause of death in AIDS cases.
7

As we argue below, there is substantial medical evidence indicating that untreated AIDS patients would die within
a short period. Our schooling impact results would thus be overestimates if it turned out the children’s schooling
also increased as the adults’ experienced declining health and progressed to death (making the children orphans).

4

Highly active antiretroviral therapy8 has been proven to reduce the likelihood of
opportunistic infections and prolong the life of HIV-infected individuals. According to WHO
guidelines, ARV therapy should be initiated around the time that individuals progress to AIDS
(WHO, 2002).9 After several months of treatment, patients are generally asymptomatic and have
improved functional capacity. Numerous studies in various countries and patient populations
have reported positive results.10,11 In Haiti, patients had weight gain and improved functional
capacity within one year after the initiation of ARVs (Koenig, Leandre, and Farmer, 2004). In
Brazil, median survival time after developing AIDS rose to 58 months with ARV therapy
(Marins et al., 2003). ARV therapy has also been highly effective at the HIV clinic where our
study took place (see Wools-Kaloustian et al., 2006, as well as the results in Thirumurthy, Graff
Zivin, and Goldstein, 2005).
While the effect of ARV therapy on the health of treated patients has been widely
documented, much less is known about the broader impact that treatment interventions can have
on the social and economic outcomes of patients and their families. Our survey in western
Kenya was designed to examine these impacts.
2.2. Household Survey Data
Households in the survey area are scattered across more than 100 villages where crop farming
and animal husbandry are the primary economic activities and maize is the major crop. The
largest health care provider in the survey area is a government-run health center that offers
primary care services. The health center also contains a clinic that provides free medical care
(including ARV therapy) to HIV-positive patients. This rural HIV clinic (one of the first in subSaharan Africa) was opened in November 2001 by the Academic Model for the Prevention and

8

In this paper, we use the terms “ARV therapy” and “ARV treatment” to refer to highly active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART), which was introduced in 1996. HAART consists of three ARV medications, with a common first-line
regimen of nevirapine, stavudine, and lamivudine. Generic medications that combine three ARVs in one pill (such
as Triomune) have recently become available.
9
Many treatment programs in developing countries, including the one that we collaborated with, have followed
these guidelines. See Grubb, Perriens, and Schwartlander (2003) and Mamlin et al. (2004).
10
For evidence from western countries where ARV therapy first became available, see Hammer et al. (1997), Hogg
et al. (1998), and Palella et al. (1998).
11
Since placebo-controlled randomized trials of ARV therapy are ethically infeasible, these studies are either
observational cohort studies or randomized trials that compare regimens composed of different antiretroviral
medications.

Treatment of HIV/AIDS (AMPATH).12 Since late-2003, AMPATH has had adequate funding to
provide ARV therapy to all patients who are eligible according to the WHO guidelines.13
We conducted two rounds of interviews between March 2004 and March 2005, with an
interval of roughly six months between rounds.14 The survey sample contains two different
groups of households: 503 households chosen randomly from a census of households in Kosirai
Division without an AMPATH patient (random sample households) and 266 households with at
least one AMPATH patient (HIV households).15 The HIV sample includes all non-pregnant
patients who entered the Mosoriot HIV clinic before April 2004 and resided in Kosirai Division.
To obtain a larger sample size, we also conducted in-clinic interviews with non-pregnant patients
who entered the clinic before April 2004 but resided outside Kosirai Division (too far away from
the clinic to be visited at home).16
Within the 266 HIV households, there are 320 individuals (including children) who are
HIV-positive and known to be receiving care at the Mosoriot HIV clinic.17 Using the AMPATH
identification numbers obtained from patients, we have established with the AMPATH Medical
Records System (AMRS) that 224 of the 320 patients (from 206 households) began receiving
ARV therapy prior to the round 2 interview.18 The remaining HIV-positive patients in our
sample were not sick enough to require ARV therapy before round 2. Our analysis in this paper

12

AMPATH is a collaboration between the Indiana University School of Medicine and the Moi University Faculty
of Health Sciences (Kenya). Descriptions of AMPATH’s work in western Kenya can be found in Mamlin, Kimaiyo,
Nyandiko, and Tierney (2004) and Cohen et al. (2005).
13
In response to evidence that individuals with AIDS have higher caloric needs (WHO, 2003), AMPATH also
began distributing food to ARV patients during our study period. Quantities were small, but nearly two thirds of our
patients received some food prior to our round 2 interview. All of the results presented in this paper remain
unchanged when we control for the provision of food to treatment households.
14
Round 1 was between March and August 2004. Round 2 was between September 2004 and March 2005.
15
In the random sample, the HIV status of respondents is usually unknown, unless the respondent gives a self-report
of having gone for an HIV test and testing HIV-positive or HIV-negative.
16
In total, 81 percent of all survey households were visited at home.
17
274 of these 320 HIV-positive individuals were interviewed; HIV-positive children of adult patients and HIVpositive spouses of in-clinic respondents were not interviewed. Included among these individuals are household
members of respondents who were reported to be HIV-positive. The figure of 320 HIV-positive individuals
excludes 15 household members who were reported to be HIV-positive by the respondent but for whom no
AMPATH identification number was made available.
18
We refer to the sample of households with HIV-positive patients receiving ARV treatment as “ARV households.”
There are 7 HIV-positive individuals whose AMPATH identification number cannot be found in the AMRS. The
ARV status of these patients is therefore unknown.

excludes all children known to be HIV-positive, as we are primarily interested in studying how
uninfected family members are affected by the provision of ARV treatment to an adult.19
In each round of the survey, information was obtained on a range of household and
individual outcomes. This included data on asset sales and purchases, housing characteristics,
hours of market labor supply in the past week by each household member, children’s current and
past school enrollment, and children’s hours of school attendance in the past week.20 For
households within Kosirai Division, all of which were visited at home, measurement of the
heights and weights of all resident children under the age of 5 years was also obtained.21 In this
paper, we focus on two key outcomes recorded in the survey: children’s education and nutrition
Table 1 compares the main characteristics of households in the random sample and HIV
sample in round 1. On average, households in the survey area have 6 members. HIV households
are significantly smaller, with about 5.5 members on average.

There are also substantial

differences in the demographic composition of households in the two samples, as well the
characteristics of their household heads. HIV households are much more likely to be headed by
single (and often widowed) women, whereas random sample households are generally headed by
married men. HIV households tend to have significantly fewer resident children and more
orphans. However, the number of resident children between the ages of 8-18 does not differ
significantly. When we examine the wealth of households, HIV households are found to own
significantly less land and livestock. This is one of several indications from the survey that they
are worse off than other households in the community.22

Interestingly, the educational

attainment of adults does not differ significantly between the two types of households. These
baseline differences highlight the importance of our panel data, which allow us to employ a
difference-in-difference approach when examining treatment impacts.

19

While we do not know the HIV status of all household members of AMPATH patients, it is likely that most young
children of adult AMPATH patient have been brought in for HIV testing. These children are provided the required
prophylaxis and/or treatment at the HIV clinic.
20
In the household visits, teams of male and female enumerators interviewed the household head and spouse as well
as a youth in the household. For in-clinic interviews, all information was obtained from the AMPATH patient.
21
In the second round, we also measured children who became older than five years between the first and second
rounds.
22
For further details on the household survey and the first round data, see Goldstein, Graff Zivin, Nangami, and
Thirumurthy (2005).

2.3. Children’s Education
When analyzing schooling outcomes, we focus on children who were between the ages of 8 and
18 in round 1. The reasons for studying this particular age group are two-fold. First, there is
substantial variation in the age at which children in Kenya begin primary school. Typically, this
occurs between the ages of 6 and 8, with considerable variation in the exact starting age. Since
we will be examining how schooling outcomes change between rounds 1 and 2, restricting the
sample to children older than 8 years allow us to focus on children who are very likely to be of
school-going age during the survey period. Likewise, children above the age of 18 are much less
likely to be enrolled in school since it is not common for children in rural areas to obtain a
university education. Older children are also more likely to leave the parental home for reasons
of employment or marriage, thereby creating a selected sample of over-18 children who are
household members.23
In the entire sample, there are a total of 1,342 children (from 539 households) between
the ages of 8 and 18 in round 1—consisting of 902 children in 368 random sample households,
343 children in 159 HIV households that have an adult patient who receives ARV treatment, and
97 children in 41 HIV households that have an adult patient who is not yet eligible for ARV
treatment.24 Attrition of children in round 2 is minimal: information is available on 876 children
from random sample households and 327 children in ARV households, representing attrition
rates of 3 percent and 5 percent, respectively.25 In the random sample, attrition generally is due
to relocation of the entire household.26 In the sample of ARV households, attrition generally
occurs because the adult patient was not found at the clinic in round 2.
The two schooling outcomes we examine are enrollment in school and hours of school
attended in the week prior to the interview. Information about these outcomes was obtained
from the primary female respondent in each household (typically the spouse of the male

23

For this reason, we do not focus on the schooling outcomes of children older than 18 years.
These figures indicate that a non-trivial fraction of households in our sample do not have any children between the
ages of 8 and 18 in round 1: 27 percent of households in the random sample and 24 percent of households in the
HIV sample. In addition, there is 1 household with an HIV-positive patient whose ARV status is unknown; this
household is therefore omitted in the data analysis.
25
These figures do not include children who were household members in round 1 but moved out before round 2. For
these children, the primary respondent was asked about school enrollment. School attendance information,
however, is generally unavailable since the primary respondent would not know how many hours of school the child
attended in the past week.
26
Refusal rates in the second round of the survey were below 1 percent in the random sample.
24

8

household head; or the female household head in the case of single-headed households).27 It is
important to distinguish between the two schooling outcomes since children can often enroll in a
school at the beginning of the school term but not attend on a regular basis (and therefore spend
very little time in school).28 Our enrollment measure indicates whether or not a child was
enrolled in a school during the term in which the interview occurred. School attendance is
measured as the primary female respondent’s report of the number of hours of school attended
by the child in the seven days prior to the interview (excluding travel time to and from the
school).29
In the context of primary schooling, it is noteworthy that Kenya’s Ministry of Education
abolished primary school fees beginning in January 2003. Given that the new policy took effect
more than one year prior to start of our study, it is unlikely that the comparisons of schooling
outcomes in round 1 and round 2 will be affected by this policy change. This policy may
provide some explanation for the high levels of school enrollments that we observe in the survey
area, as we discuss below. It should be kept in mind, however, that secondary school fees still
exist and can represent a substantial fraction of household income. Secondary school attendance
may also be lower and more variable since the effective ‘price’ of spending time in school is
greater for older kids who are more productive in the labor market. As a result, our analyses will
generally distinguish between the schooling outcomes of young and old children.
2.4. Children’s Nutrition
Anthropometry is widely recognized to be an important tool for assessing children’s nutritional
status (Waterlow et al., 1977; WHO Working Group, 1986; WHO, 1995). Two anthropometric
indices, with different biological and statistical interpretations, are typically considered in the
literature: weight-for-height and height-for-age.

The former is a measure of thinness (or

wasting) while the latter is measure of shortness (or stunting).30 Weight-for-height is particularly
27

In cases where the respondent is an HIV-positive patient who was interviewed at the clinic, information on
schooling outcomes is not necessarily obtained from the primary female in the household. For example, the
respondent may be a male patient, or a female patient who is not the head or spouse.
28
Primary and secondary schools in Kenya have three terms in each year. The first term begins in January and ends
in April, the second term begins in May and ends in August, and the third term begins in September and ends in
December.
29
To emphasize the distinction between the discrete measure of school enrollment and the continuous measure of
school attendance, the latter variable is generally referred to with the label “hours of school attendance”.
30
A third index, weight-for-age, is not widely used since it is primarily a composite of weight-for-height and heightfor-age. As a result, it cannot distinguish between acute and chronic malnutrition. See Waterlow et al. (1977) and
Gorstein et al. (1994) for further discussion.

9

sensitive to short-term growth disturbances caused by factors such as inadequate food and
illnesses.

As such, it represents a current estimate of nutritional status and can exhibit

considerable variation over short periods of time. Height-for-age represents the cumulative
effects of previous growth disturbances. Since growth in height is a much slower process than
growth in body mass, a shortfall (or catch-up) in height-for-age will generally be slow to emerge,
especially for children older than 2 years (Gorstein et al., 1994; WHO Working Group, 1986).
For these reasons, weight-for-height is particularly well-suited for examining the short-term
nutritional changes of interest in this paper. The primary outcome we examine is the weight-forheight Z-score, which is based on comparisons to the NCHS/CDC reference population of
children in the U.S.31 For a child with a given weight and height, the Z-score is calculated by
subtracting the median weight of children in the reference population with the same height (as
well as same age group and sex) and then dividing by the standard deviation in the reference
population. The anthropometric indicators of children in the study population thereby remain
comparable to each other and can also be compared to the reference population.
As noted above, the heights and weights of children less than 5 years of age were
measured during all household visits in each round. Although we conducted household visits for
all non-pregnant HIV-positive patients that resided within Kosirai Division, the total number of
these households is small (and not all of them have children under the age of 5 years). Thus,
among HIV households that have an adult ARV recipient, a total of only 41 uninfected children
were measured in both rounds. In the random sample, 349 children were measured in both
rounds.32 Despite the relatively small sample sizes, in Section 5 we use the anthropometric data
to examine what happens to the nutritional status of children as a result of providing ARV
treatment to adults in their households.

31

The comparison to well-nourished children in the U.S. is a common practice when analyzing anthropometric data
from developing countries, where reference standards based on data from well-nourished children are generally not
available. For a discussion of this reference population, see Gorstein et al. (1994) and WHO (1995).
32
These sample sizes are smaller than those reported in Table 1 for several reasons. In the random sample and ARV
sample, absence on repeated visits and attrition from the sample are among the reasons why the number of children
used in our analysis is smaller than the number of children between 0-5 years in round 1. In the ARV sample, many
children were not measured because households were outside the survey area of Kosirai Division and therefore not
visited at home. Children who are themselves HIV-positive and are receiving care at the HIV clinic are also
excluded from our analysis.

10

3. Empirical Strategy
This section describes how we identify the effect of treatment on children’s schooling and
nutritional status. In particular, we discuss the methods used to analyze the longitudinal survey
data on the outcomes of children living with HIV-positive adults who receive ARV treatment.
3.1. Empirical Strategy for Schooling Outcomes
The reduced form treatment effect is identified by comparing schooling outcomes of children in
ARV households in round 1 and 2. When attributing changes in enrollment and hours of
attendance between rounds to the provision of treatment to an adult household member,
however, it is also necessary to control for other time-varying factors that influence schooling
outcomes. In the rural setting that we study, these factors include seasonal fluctuations in
weather, labor demand, and food availability. We control for these factors by using data from
children in the randomly selected households and by including a full set of month-of-interview
indicators in the schooling equations. We also include individual fixed effects to control for
time-invariant characteristics of children and their households that might influence levels of
school enrollment and attendance.

Specifically, the following equation is estimated with

longitudinal data for children in the ARV and random sample households:

Siht = α ih + β1 ( ARV HH h * ROUND 2t ) + β 2 ROUND 2t +

10

γ MONTH tτ +ε iht .

τ =1 τ

(1)

Siht is the schooling outcome of interest for child i in household h at time t (round 1 or 2),

ih

is a

fixed effect for individual i in household h, ARVHHh is an indicator variables equal to 1 if
household h has an adult who began ARV therapy at any time before round two, and ROUND2t
indicates whether the observation is from round 2. The round 2 indicator along with the ten
month-of-interview indicator variables (with one month from each round omitted to avoid
collinearity with the round 2 indicator) control for monthly fluctuations in schooling outcomes in
the entire community. The coefficient of interest,

1,

measures the change in schooling levels

(between round 1 and round 2) that is due to the adult patient being treated. This strategy is
tantamount to a difference-in-difference estimation strategy in which the treatment group
consists of children in ARV households and the “control” group consists of children in the
random sample.
Earlier work has documented a highly non-linear temporal pattern in the health status and
labor supply of patients after ARV treatment is initiated, with the largest impacts occurring

11

within the first six months of treatment (Thirumurthy, Graff Zivin, and Goldstein, 2005). As
such, we take advantage of variation in the treatment initiation date within our sample to estimate
heterogeneous treatment effects on schooling.33 We divide the sample of children in ARV
households into two sub-samples of (a) children living with adult patients who had been
receiving treatment for more than 100 days in round 1, and (b) children living with adult patients
who had been receiving treatment for less than 100 days in round 1, including those who began
receiving treatment between round 1 and round 2. Using individual fixed effects and month-ofinterview controls, we then estimate the following equation to examine whether children in the
two sub-samples have different changes in enrollment and attendance levels between rounds:
Siht = α ih + β1 ( ARV HH <100, h * ROUND 2t ) + β 2 ( ARVHH >100, h * ROUND 2t )

+ β 3 ROUND 2 t +

10

γ MONTH tτ +ε iht .

τ =1 τ

(2)

ARVHH<100,h and ARVHH>100,h are indicator variables equal to 1 if household h has an adult who
was receiving ARV therapy for less than or more than 100 days, respectively, at the time of the
round 1 interview. The coefficient

1

would indicate whether the treatment effect occurs soon

after treatment is initiated, while the coefficient

2

would indicate whether an effect is evident in

the later stages of treatment.
The results from estimating the reduced form equations above will reveal how ARV
treatment ultimately affects the schooling outcomes of children in treated patients’ households.
Since the survey recorded information on the hours of market labor performed by children in the
week prior to interview, we can also examine how the effect of treatment on hours of school
attended compares to the effect of treatment on market labor supply. Thus, as an extension of
our analysis, estimate equations 1 and 2 with the children’s labor supply, rather than their school
attendance, as the primary dependent variable.
3.2. Empirical Strategy Using Orphans in Random Sample as Comparison Group

The primary estimation strategy above is unlikely to reveal the ‘true’ impact of ARV treatment
because our data do not contain a control group of households with AIDS patients who do not
receive ARV treatment. Children’s schooling outcomes under the counterfactual scenario of no
treatment are therefore unobserved. However, as discussed earlier, there is an extensive medical

33

Among the adults who began receiving ARV therapy before round 2, roughly half began treatment more than 100
days before round 1. The other half began treatment less than 100 days before round 1 or between round 1 and
round 2.

12

literature showing that untreated individuals with AIDS have extremely low life expectancy, as
well as growing evidence that children in Africa experience declining school attendance in the
periods before and after they become orphans. Thus our results under the estimation strategy
above are likely to be underestimates of the impact of treatment.
As a step toward comparing the outcomes of children in treatment households to the
relevant counterfactual group, we make use of data from the 79 children in the random sample
who are orphans.

While information about their parent’s death is generally limited, the

schooling trends of orphans in the random sample may be a close representation of what would
happen to children in treatment households under the “no treatment scenario.” We therefore
estimate equations 1 and 2 for a restricted sample consisting only of children in treatment
households and orphaned children in the random sample.

One potential weakness of this

approach relates to the absence of information on the timing of parental death. If the parents of
orphans in the random sample died long ago, any effect of parental death on schooling trends
may have run its course before round 1 of the survey and the data on orphans would therefore be
a poor representation of the counterfactual.34
3.3. Empirical Strategy for Children’s Nutrition

To analyze the anthropometric data, we follow the standard practice of constructing weight-forheight standard deviation scores (Z-scores) using the 1978 NCHS/CDC reference population of
children in the U.S. This index compares the weight of a boy or girl to the median weight of
boys or girls in the reference population with the same height. Thus, a negative Z-score indicates
that a child is thinner than the median child in the US population.
The effect of ARV treatment on the anthropometric outcomes of children living with
treated patients is estimated by an empirical strategy similar to the one outlined above for
schooling outcomes. In particular, we use the longitudinal data to estimate an equation with age
controls and individual (child) fixed effects:
6 −12
WHZ iht = α ih + θ1 AGEmthsiht

+ β1 ( ARVHH h * ROUND 2t )

γ MONTH tτ +ε it .

τ =1 τ

(3)

In our sample, the school attendance levels of random sample orphans are similar to those of children in ARV
households at baseline and declining between survey rounds, providing suggestive evidence that parental death was
relatively recent.

13

WHZiht is the weight-for-height Z-score of child i in household h at time t (round 1 or round 2),
ARVHHh indicates whether household h has an adult ARV recipient, and ROUND2t is an
indicator for observations from round 2.35 This contrasts the trend in nutritional status of
children in ARV households with that of children in the random sample of households. Data
from the latter group of children allows us to control for the sensitivity of the weight-for-height
Z-score to age and to seasonal patterns in food availability. We also estimate a revised version
of equation 3 that allows for heterogeneous treatment effects among children in early-stage and
later-stage treatment households. Finally, because there are only 16 children in the random
sample under the age of 5 who are reported to be orphans, we do not compare outcomes of
children in treatment households to orphans in the random sample.

4. Results for Children’s Schooling
School enrollment rates in the survey area are extremely high, as the summary statistics in Table
2 indicate. Among all children in the random sample between the ages of 8 and 18 in round 1,
95 percent were reported as being enrolled in school.36 However, this conceals significant
differences in enrollment rates between primary and secondary school-aged children. There is
nearly universal enrollment among children between the ages of 8 and 14 years, but enrollment
rates decline for older children. Enrollment differences between children in the ARV households
and the random sample of households are small and statistically insignificant, in round 1 as well
as round 2.
The high enrollment rates for younger children are similar to findings from earlier
surveys of school enrollment in Kenya (Yamano and Jayne, 2005; Evans and Miguel, 2005).37
These rates are also consistent with the more recent figures from the nationally representative
2003 Demographic and Health Survey (Central Bureau of Statistics, 2004). The DHS data
indicate that in rural Kenya nearly 90 percent of children between the ages of 6 and 15 were
attending school in 2003. It is noteworthy, however, that the high enrollment rates found in the
DHS may partly be driven by the nationwide abolition of primary school fees shortly before the
35

Following guidelines in Waterlow et al. (1977) for samples of our size, we use a set of one-year age indicators for
children older than 1 year and six-month age indicators for children younger than 1 year.
36
The sample used excludes a small number of children for whom enrollment information is available but
attendance information is unavailable. This is likely to be the case for children in boarding schools, since the
respondents are unlikely to know the number of hours attended in the past week.
37
Both studies report average enrollment rates nearing 90 percent for children less than 14 years of age. The study
by Evans and Miguel (2005) also took place in western Kenya and found enrollment rates of 98 percent in 1998.

14

survey was conducted. The absence of fees makes enrollment inexpensive, but the costs of
regular attendance can be much more substantial. These include the variable costs of school
materials, daily transportation to and from school in some cases, and most importantly, the
opportunity costs of time spent in school. Thus, a better measure of schooling, particularly for
primary school children, requires an additional focus on school attendance.
As discussed in Section 2, school attendance is measured as the total number of hours
that the child spent in school during the seven days prior to the interview. Respondents were
then asked follow-up questions about whether the reported hours of school attendance for the
child was unusual, and if so, the reason why it was unusual. Since a significant number of
respondents were interviewed during (or shortly after) school holiday periods, it is therefore
important to control for the presence of holidays during the recall period. To address this
complication in our analysis, we focus on a restricted sample of children in households for which
interviews occurred during non-holiday periods.38 Since the survey did not collect information
on the number of days in the past week that were school holidays, we do not pursue an alternate
strategy of keeping all the observations of unusual hours of attendance due to holidays and
including a dummy variable that indicates whether the past week contained school holidays.39
Table 2 reports the summary statistics for hours of attendance in the restricted sample that
excludes children who were reported to have low attendance because of school holidays. The
summary statistics indicate that differences in hours of attendance between children in random
sample and ARV households are negligible. Children in both household samples attend school
for an average of about 34 hours in round 1 (unconditional on enrollment). Figures 1 and 2
display non-parametric regressions of school hours attended on age, unconditional and
conditional on enrollment, respectively.40 The differences between boys and girls are minor,
except that older girls appear to have lower hours of attendance than older boys. In a pooled
regression with additional controls, however, these differences are not statistically significant.

38

We also exclude cases in which respondents reported that children did not go to school because Class 8 exams
were being held in late November. This is the nationwide exam taken to enter secondary school, and most primary
schools in the survey area did not hold school for children below Class 8 during the day of these exams.
39
The inclusion of month-of-interview (or week-of-interview) indicators is also an inadequate control for the effect
of school holidays on weekly hours attended. This is because there appears to be variation in school holidays across
schools/locations. The use of children from the random sample as a control group to absorb the effects of such
variation is not feasible, as the required set of location-date indicators would leave us with inadequate power to
control for these effects.
40
The regression uses an Epanechnikov kernel, with a bandwidth of 3 hours.

15

Several of these results are reported below. The unconditional and conditional age-attendance
patterns are very different because older children are significantly less likely to be enrolled in
school, but conditional on being enrolled, older children are likely to have longer school days (as
a result of being enrolled in secondary schools rather than primary schools).
Figure 3 displays non-parametric regressions of school hours attended on age for children
in random sample and ARV households, in round 1 and round 2. It is evident in Figure 3 (and
Table 2) that average hours attended are lower in round 2, for both the random sample and the
ARV sample. The most likely explanation for this stems from the fact that round 2 was
conducted during the harvest period, when children generally spend more time working on the
farm. Regardless of the reason for this decline in hours of school attendance, the advantage of
our empirical approach, which makes use of a comparison group of children in the random
sample, is that secular patterns in hours of attendance will not result in biased estimates of the
response to ARV treatment.

Figure 3 also shows that whereas younger children in ARV

households have slightly lower hours of attendance than children in the random sample of
households during round 1, they have higher hours of attendance in round 2. Estimating the size
of such increases in attendance will be the focus of the main empirical strategy employed in this
paper.
To identify the major correlates of school enrollment and hours of attendance, we
estimate cross-sectional regressions on our sample of children between the ages of 8 and 18
years in round 1. All of the regressions also include a full set of month-of-interview indicators to
control for seasonality. The hours of attendance regressions are not conditional on enrollment.41
The results in Table 3 show that there are no significant differences in schooling outcomes
between boys and girls. Compared to children who are 18 years old in round 1, younger children
are significantly more likely to be enrolled. Hours attended (unconditional on enrollment) are
also higher for younger children, with the peak occurring for children between 11-14 years.
Parental education and family background are recognized as being strongly associated
with children’s education (e.g. Behrman, Foster, Rosenzweig, and Vashishta, 1999, see Strauus
and Thomas, 1995 for one overview). The results in Table 3 verify that this association holds in
our survey data as well. The amount of land owned by the child’s household is positively
41

It is not instructive to examine school attendance conditional on enrollment in both rounds of data since changes
from no attendance to some attendance (or vice versa) could represent important treatment effects. Very few
children are reported to be not enrolled in both rounds.

16

associated with enrollment and hours of attendance. Years of schooling completed by the child’s
father and mother also has a positive association, with father’s schooling being more strongly
related than mother’s schooling.42 Consistent with the evidence on orphans cited earlier, we find
that children whose mother is not a household member are at a significant educational
disadvantage.
Finally, we focus on the outcomes of children living with ARV recipients. Table 3 shows
that in round 1, children in households of patients who have just begun ARV treatment attend
significantly fewer hours of school than children in the random sample. In round 2, such
differences are not found. Thus, it seems that children in these ARV households experience a
relative increase in the amount of time spent in school between rounds, compared to other
children in the sample. The next section examines the magnitude and significance of these
changes in schooling patterns.
4.1. Main Results with Child Fixed Effects

Since the estimates in Table 3 may be biased due to omitted variables that are correlated with the
indicator of whether the child lives in a household with an HIV-positive adult receiving ARV
treatment, we use the longitudinal data to estimate equations 1 and 2. As discussed earlier, both
of these equations include individual fixed effects.
Columns 1 and 3 of Table 4a show the average treatment effect on school enrollment and
hours of school attendance, respectively, for children in all ARV households. There is no change
in these children’s enrollment rates during the six months between rounds 1 and 2, but there is a
large and significant increase of 4.39 hours in weekly school attendance. This represents a 13
percent increase relative to the average weekly hours attended by these children in round 1. This
result is thus the first indication that the provision of ARV treatment has a positive effect on
school outcomes of children living in treated patients’ households.
Table 4a also presents results from estimating equation 2, which tests for heterogeneous
effects that correspond to the length of time that patients have been receiving ARV treatment.
Again, no effect on school enrollment is found (column 2), a result that is perhaps not surprising
given the low costs of enrollment and the high levels of enrollment for all children at baseline.
For hours of attendance however, there is significant heterogeneity in the treatment effects. As
42

Since the survey did not collect information on parents’ schooling for orphans and foster children, we use an
imputed value equal to the mean of father’s or mother’s schooling in the entire sample. We also include dummy
variables indicating whether an imputed value is used.

17

column 6 shows, the increase in hours of attendance between rounds is particularly large for
children in households of adults who are just beginning treatment in round 1 (ARHH<100). The
average increase in weekly hours attended is 6.66 hours for these children (representing a 21.8
percent increase relative to their average attendance level in round 143).

For children in

households with an adult who started treatment at least 100 days prior to round 1 (ARHH>100),
there is no significant change in weekly hours attended. Taken together, these results suggest
that children in ARV households experience the largest increase in hours of attendance within six
months after treatment is initiated for the adult. In subsequent periods, they experience no
additional changes, but they continue to maintain their initial increase in attendance. A striking
feature of these results is their consistency with the large health and labor supply response to
ARV treatment among adult AIDS patients (see Thirumurthy, Graff Zivin, and Goldstein, 2005).
Given the previous finding that patients’ health improves and labor supply increases soon after
the initiation of treatment, these results suggest that the resulting income effect and decrease in
care-giving burden allows children to spend more time in school.44
In Kenya, as in many developing countries, work and household responsibilities are
frequently gender- and age-specific. Thus, when an adult becomes healthier and returns to work,
the magnitude of the income and substitution effects that operate on household members and the
extent to which they translate into changes in schooling outcomes may depend on their age and
sex.45 In Table 4a, Columns 3, 4, 7, and 8 show the results from testing for heterogeneous
effects by sex. When we examine all ARV households together (columns 3 and 4), the results
suggest that only boys experience a significant increase in attendance (of 6.74 hours).46
However, when we control for the length of time that the adult patient has been on treatment
(columns 7 and 8), we find that there are significant increases in hours of attendance for both
boys and girls. The increase in school attendance of 9.14 hours for boys is especially large,
43

The average hours attended is 30.47 for children in households with adult ARV recipients who had been on
treatment for less than 100 days in round 1 or who began treatment shortly after round 1 (represented by ARVHH<100
in equation 2).
44
The absence of any effect on school enrollment rates (columns 1 and 2 in Table 4a) suggests the provision of
treatment results in improved school attendance among children already enrolled in school.
45
We might also expect the effect of treatment to depend on the gender of the treated patient, but preliminary
analysis indicates that this is not the case. However, given that nearly 75 percent of adult ARV recipients in our
sample are women, we may not have large enough sample sizes to detect significantly different effects between
male and female patients.
46
In results that are not reported, we find that the treatment effects are generally not dependent on the amount of
land owned by the household (a common measure of wealth in the area). However, we do find that for girls living
in treatment households that do not own any land, there is a significant increase in hours of school attendance.

18

representing a 30 percent increase relative to their average attendance level in round 1.47 In both
cases, the increase in hours of attendance occur within roughly six months after the initiation of
treatment.
In table 4b, we test for further heterogeneity in treatment effects by reporting the results
for boys and girls of different age groups, focusing on primary school age children (ages 8-14 in
round 1) and older children (14-18 in round 1).48 We again find no significant changes in school
enrollment rates of children in ARV households. Reported school enrollment is nearly universal
for young girls and there is no variation between rounds, making it impossible to estimate a
treatment effect. In contrast to the previous results for all boys and girls, we do not find many
significant changes in hours of attendance at this disaggregated level. The lone exception is for
young boys, who experience a large and significant increase of 11.39 hours in weekly attendance
within roughly six months after the initiation of treatment (column 2). It is important to note,
however, that our power to detect significant changes in hours of attendance is somewhat
compromised by the fairly small sample sizes of children in each age-sex group.
To put these results in perspective, it is worth comparing the magnitudes of the treatment
effect on hours of school attendance (particularly those reported in Table 4a) to the treatment
effect on children’s weekly hours of market labor supply. Table 5 therefore presents the results
from estimating equations that identify the effect of ARV treatment on labor supply. The
equations estimated are similar in form to equations 1 and 2, with hours of market labor
performed in the week prior to interview as the dependent variable. Data from children in the
random sample are again used to control for aggregate seasonal effects on labor supply.
Column 1 of Table 5 shows that on average, there is a large and significant reduction of
4.5 hours between round 1 and round 2 in the weekly market labor supply of children living in
households of ARV recipients.49 This is remarkably close to the estimated increase of 4.4 hours
when the analogous equation is estimated for weekly hours of school attendance (see column 4
of Table 4a), suggesting a near-perfect crowd-out of work for school in response to
improvements in adult health in the household. These results are particularly striking since for
47

The average hours attended are 30.15 for boys in households with adult ARV recipients who had been on
treatment for less than 100 days in round 1 or who began treatment shortly after round 1.
48
The results below are robust to different definitions of these young and old age groups (with cutoffs at 12 and 13
years). The cutoff of 14 years is chosen since it is typically the age when children complete primary school.
49
The results presented here differ only slightly from those in Thirumurthy, Graff Zivin, and Goldstein (2005), as
our analysis here is restricted to children in households that were interviewed during non-holiday periods.

19

each child, the information on hours of school attendance in the past week and hours of market
labor supply in the past week was obtained from the household’s primary female and male
respondent, respectively, in separate interviews.50 Turning to the temporal pattern in labor
supply changes, column 4 of Table 5 shows that the average change in the labor supply of all
children in ARV households occurs soon after treatment is initiated for the adult patient, and that
significant reductions in labor supply continue to occur in the later stages of treatment as well.
Looking beyond average effects for all children in ARV households, columns 2, 3, 5, and
6 reveal larger and significant reductions in labor supply for boys and no significant changes for
girls. For boys in all ARV households, there is an average decrease in market labor supply of
7.72 hours per week in the six months between survey rounds (column 2 of Table 5). This is
quite close to the estimated increase of 6.74 hours in weekly school attendance (column 4 or
Table 4a). For boys in households of patients who are in the early stages of treatment, the
estimated decrease in market labor supply (8.0 hours) also remarkably similar to the estimated
increase in weekly school attendance (9.14 hours). The continued decline in the labor supply of
boys in the later stages of adult treatment is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in
hours of school attendance. The lack of any treatment effect on the market labor supply of girls
should be interpreted with caution. Girls in the survey area spend significantly more time in
non-market labor activities (such as household chores and care-giving) than market ones. If girls
experience decreases in their non-market labor supply when an adult household member
becomes healthier due to ARV treatment, this will not be captured in the market labor supply
measures reported in Table 5.

The evidence in this paper on girls’ school attendance is

consistent with such a time re-allocation pattern for girls (although we lack data on non-market
labor supply to test whether this is actually the case).51
In summary, the results in this section indicate that the provision of ARV treatment to
adults results in significant increases in hours of school attendance for children living with the
patients. For boys, these results are very consistent with the evidence that treatment also results
in a decrease in their market labor supply. In particular, the effects on hours of attendance occur
almost exclusively through reallocations of their time away from market labor supply. For girls,

50

In addition, the respondents were also interviewed by different interviewers.
The survey did not collect information on non-market labor supply in round 2, thereby making it impossible to
examine how time allocation to non-market activities was affected by the provision of ARV treatment.
51

20

the schooling increases do not appear to be driven by changes in their market labor supply,
suggesting a reallocation of time from non-market labor supply and/or leisure.
4.2. Results Based on Comparison to Orphans in the Random Sample

As discussed in Section 3.2, an alternative comparison group for children in ARV households is
orphaned children in the random sample. Since there are 79 orphaned children in the random
sample, we can examine schooling levels over time for the two groups of children using the
specification described by equation 2.52 Table 6a presents these results. The main finding is that
the effect of ARV treatment on hours of attendance is much larger than the effects reported in
Section 4.1. As we might expect, the treatment effect increases when the comparison group
resembles what would happen to children under the counterfactual scenario of no treatment.
Column 1 of Table 6a shows that for all children in ARV households, hours of attendance
increase significantly between round 1 and round 2. The increase in hours of attendance is larger
for children in households of patients who are in the early stages of treatment—the increase of
10.67 hours is nearly two times the effect estimated previously and it represents a 35 percent
increase relative to these children’s average attendance level in round 1 of 30.47 hours. Columns
2 and 3 show that the increase in hours of attendance is significant for both boys and girls,
respectively. The point estimates for boys and girls in households of patients in the early stages
of treatment are again considerably larger than before, at 15.69 and 10.8 hours respectively
(compare to 9.14 and 6.36 hours in Table 4a). In contrast to the previous results, a positive and
significant effect on hours of attendance is also observed for children in households of patients in
later-stages of treatment in round 1. Thus, relative to orphans in the random sample, children in
households of adult ARV recipients experience increases in hours of attendance that continue to
occur well beyond the first six months of treatment. Finally, columns 4-7 make clear that these
schooling impacts are concentrated on children of primary school age.
As noted earlier, a large fraction of adult patients at the HIV clinic are women who have
lost their husbands (most likely due to AIDS) and as a result, many children in the ARV
households have already been orphaned. Since the orphaned children in ARV households may
resemble the orphans in the random sample to some degree, we instead compare the schooling
outcomes of non-orphans in treatment households to those of orphans in the random sample. By
52

As noted earlier, in the scenario of no treatment for the adult patients, there is a large literature that suggests the
children would be orphaned and that their schooling outcomes would decline.

21

focusing on non-orphans in the ARV households, we are considering a group of children who are
very likely to become orphans between round 1 and round 2 (or shortly after) were it not for the
provision of ARV treatment to the adult patient. As shown in Table 6b, compared to the orphans
in the random sample, a large and significant increase in hours of attendance is found for the
non-orphans in treatment households. Column 1 shows that there is an increase of 9.46 hours in
the school attendance for orphans in households of ARV recipients who are in the early stages of
treatment. This increase is similar to the one found for all children (orphans and non-orphans) in
these households (column 1 of Table 6a), as are the increases for boys and girls in these
households (columns 2 and 3 of Tables 6a and 6b). Given the increasingly small number of
observations, the precision of the estimates is compromised considerably when we examine subgroups of children (columns 4-7). The results in Tables 6a and 6b nonetheless illustrate that the
impact of ARV treatment on hours of school attendance of children in treated households is
considerably larger when we compare these children to the “counterfactual” group of orphans in
the survey area.

5. Results for Children’s Nutrition
As ARV treatment improves the health and employment outcomes of adult HIV-positive
patients, outcomes other than time allocation of children (to labor and schooling) are also likely
to be affected. In particular, an income effect from the increased labor supply of the adult patient
may affect the nutritional status of household members. Specifically, we examine whether there
is a change in the nutritional status of very young children (age 0-5 years) residing in the
households of adult ARV recipients.
Table 7 presents summary statistics of weights and heights for all children measured in
both rounds of the survey. Despite low baseline measures for children in ARV households, the
mean weight-for-height Z-score of children between the ages of 0-5 years is not statistically
different from that of children in the random sample of households (in either of the two survey
rounds).

This focus on means, however, masks important differences in the tails of the

distribution. The simple cross-sectional comparisons show that 12 percent of children in ARV

22

households exhibit wasting (Z-score below –2.0) in Round 1, significantly more than the 4
percent in the random sample. Suggestively, these differences disappear in Round 2.53
Some of these patterns are also evident in Table 8, which reports results from regressing
the weight-for-height Z-score (for each round separately) on a set of individual and household
characteristics.54 The non-linear growth pattern for children is reflected in the various age
coefficients, which indicate that Z-scores are initially high but decline in the first year after birth.
Column 1 shows that in the first round, children living in ARV households have lower weightfor-height on average than children in the random sample of households, but the difference is not
statistically significant. We then divide the sample of children in ARV households as before, on
the basis of treatment duration when the round 1 interview occurred. Column 2 shows that
children in both treatment groups have lower Z-scores in round 1, but the differences are not
statistically significant.

Examining the nutritional status of the same children in round 2

(columns 3 and 4 of Table 8), we find that children in ARV households are relatively better off
in comparison to round 1. Column 4 shows that this is true for children in both groups of ARV
households.
To investigate changes in nutritional status more thoroughly, we estimate equation 3
using the longitudinal data. We also include fixed effects for the interviewers who measured the
children.55,56 As column 1 of Table 9 indicates, children in ARV households have higher Zscores in round 2, but the point estimate of 0.25 is not statistically significant. However,
previous work found that patients experience the largest clinical and labor market impacts soon
after the initiation of ARV treatment (Wools-Kaloustian et al., 2006; Thirumurthy, Graff Zivin,
and Goldstein, 2005). If these improvements translate into increased family income, there is
reason to expect that short-term nutritional status should improve most for children in
households of adult patients beginning to receive treatment in round 1. As column 2 of Table 9
indicates, this is exactly the pattern we observe. Children residing with patients who began ARV
therapy less than 100 days prior to round 1 have a large and significant increase in their weight53

Table 7 also reports substantial variation in Z-scores by age group, as has been reported in other studies
(Waterlow et al., 1977).
54
Seasonal variations in weight-for-height are common (WHO Working Group, 1986), so we control for seasonality
here and when analyzing changes in weight-for-height.
55
Following the recommendations in WHO (1995), the 9 observations with weight-for-height Z-score or height-forage Z-score larger than 6 or smaller than -6 are excluded from the analysis.
56
Interviewer fixed effects are included here because anthropometry, particularly measuring heights in small
children, is challenging and can vary with individual skills and experience.

for-height Z-score between rounds. The magnitude of the point estimate is worth emphasizing.
Weight-for-height of children living with early-stage treatment recipients improves by 0.57
standard deviations in the six months between rounds 1 and 2, which more than erases the “pretreatment” discrepancy in nutritional status that was observed in round 1. Children in other ARV
households, on the other hand, have no significant change in Z-scores. The large magnitude of
the improvement in weight-for-height soon after initiation of ARV treatment is consistent with
the fact that it is a measure of current nutritional status and is known to be sensitive to short-term
changes in the availability of food and other factors that affect growth.57,58
While the results in columns 1 and 2 inform us about the average change in weight-forheight Z-score among children in treatment households, the effect of treatment on children with
extremely low Z-scores in round 1 is of special interest given the potential long term effects of
extreme malnutrition. We examine this by looking at how the fraction of children at the bottom
of the distribution (those with Z-scores below -2.0, i.e. wasting) responds to the provision of
treatment. In columns 3 and 4 of Table 9, we define the dependent variable as an indicator
variable of whether a child’s Z-score is below -2.0. The results show that there is indeed a
significant decline in wasting among young children living in households of ARV treatment
recipients – in column 3, we see that the likelihood that a child is wasted declines by 9
percentage points across all treatment households. As column 4 shows, the treatment effect is
more pronounced for children residing with patients who began ARV therapy more than 100
days prior to round 1. For children in early-stage treatment households, the decline in the
likelihood of wasting is not statistically significant. These latter results suggest that, for children
in the bottom of the distribution – those that have a larger amount of catching up to do – the
effects can manifest well into the course of a household member’s treatment.
Considering the growing evidence that early childhood nutrition affects cognitive abilities
later in life (Alderman, Behrman, Lavy, and Menon, 2001; Glewwe, Jacoby, and King, 2001;
Glewwe and King, 2001), the results in Table 9 are especially noteworthy. The impact of

57

The estimates can also be compared to the estimated effect of South Africa’s Old Age Pension program on the
nutritional status of children living with pension recipients. In this program, women older than 60 years and men
older than 65 years receive a large monthly pension. Duflo (2003) finds that pensions received by women increased
the weight-for-height of girls by 1.19 standard deviations.
58
Since height-for-age is an anthropometric index that changes slowly, children are unlikely to experience large
changes over the course of six months. When examined as an outcome variable, it is reassuring that we find no
significant changes in the height-for-age Z-scores of children living with ARV recipients.

24

treatment on the nutritional status of children in treated patients’ household may well equate to
being the most long-lasting social benefit from providing ARV treatment.59

6. Conclusion
The morbidity and mortality associated with AIDS poses a significant threat to family well-being
among those infected. Our results suggest that the diminished earning capacity of HIV-infected
adults along with the additional caregiver burden associated with their illness hastens the
participation of children in the labor force and reduces their schooling attendance.

ARV

treatment, which dramatically improves the health of infected individuals, reverses these effects.
Children work less and spend more time in school; very young children are better nourished. In
contrast to the literature that examines more obviously temporary health and income shocks, we
find the impacts on children’s schooling and nutrition to be especially large.

Indeed, the

magnitude of the effects found here suggest that the mechanisms that households use to cope
with transient shocks are of little assistance in the face of what is initially perceived as a severe
permanent shock – the imminent death of a household member.
Of course, our results also have important implications for how one should value
investments in ARV treatment. Most research in this area denominates the returns to treatment
in some metric of health, measures that are focused on morbidity and mortality impacts for
patients. Even the use of quality- (or disability-) adjusted-life-years saved, which under certain
conditions can capture patient income effects, still misses the important non-patient impacts
described in this paper. These impacts are not small. Within six months after the initiation of
treatment for HIV-infected adults, weekly hours of school attendance for children in the treated
adults’ households increases by over 20 percent. When these children are compared to a group
that better represents the counterfactual scenario of no treatment, the schooling impacts are even
larger: weekly hours of school attendance increases by 35 percent in the first six months and
continues to climb thereafter. The impacts on the nutritional status of very young children are
equally impressive. Given the high returns to these two forms of children’s human capital, our
results suggest that ARV treatment has benefits that extend well beyond those experienced
directly by treated patients.
59

Because of limited sample size considerations, we do not compare the children in ARV households to orphans in
the random sample of households.

25

These intergenerational impacts are not only important for family welfare, they have
potentially important implications for economic growth. The increases in school attendance and
improvements in the nutrition of very young children are likely to translate into higher levels of
educational attainment for kids in HIV-infected households. As a result, treating the current
generation of infected adults will contribute to economic growth in future years. Conversely, the
absence of treatment will lead to an economic contraction. Importantly, these intertemporal
economic consequences of not providing treatment would be experienced even if we divert
current treatment expenditures to disease prevention efforts. Thus, the discussions of any such
diversion must weigh these costs against the benefits derived from reducing prevalence rates in
the future. The HIV/AIDS epidemic and our response to it exert a profound influence on
household investment decisions today, creating an inextricable link between the welfare of
current and future generations in countries heavily impacted by the disease.

Dependent variable WHZ (Weight-for-Height Z-score) is calculated from the measured weights and heights
of children and based on comparison to a well-nourished reference population of children in the U.S. In
columns 3 and 4, the dependent variable is an indicator of whether WHZ is less than or equal to -2
(meaning the child is classified as exhibiting wasting). All regressions include child fixed effects, fixed
effects for the interviewer who measured the child, and ten month-of-interview indicators (with one month
from each round omitted to avoid collinearity with the round 2 indicator). Observations with weight-forheight Z-score or height-for-age Z-score larger than 6 or smaller than -6 are excluded from the analysis.
