The Optimal Use of Fines and Imprisonment

Abstract
This paper examines the use of fines and imprisonment
to deter individuals from engaging in harmful activities.
These sanctions are analyzed separately as well as together,

first for identical risk-neutral individuals and then for
two groups of risk-neutral individuals who differ by wealth.

When fines are used alone and individuals are identical, the
optimal fine and probability of apprehension are such that

there is some "underdeterrencei' If individuals differ by
wealth, then the optimal fine for the high wealth group

exceeds the fine for the low wealth group. When imprisonment
is used alone and individuals are identical, the optimal

imprisonment term and probability may be such that there is

either underdeterrence or overdeterrence. If individuals
differ by wealth, the optimal imprisonment term for the high
wealth group may be longer or shorter than the term for the

low wealth group. When fines and imprisonment are used
together, it is desirable to use the fine to its maximum
feasible extent before possibly supplementing it with an

imprisonment term. The effects of risk aversion on these
results are also discussed.

I. Introduction

This paper builds upon the work of Becker (1968) in
analyzing the use of fines and imprisonment to deter individuals from engaging in harmful activitieS.V The optimal
use of these sanctions is examined in a model in which it is
assumed that fines are socially costless, that imprisonment
is socially costly, and that regardless of which sanction is
used, the apprehension of individuals is socially costly."
The sanctions are analyzed separately as well as together,

first for identical risk—neutral individuals and then for
two groups of risk-neutral individuals who differ by wealth.
The main conclusions of the paper can be briefly summarized.

when fines are used alone and individuals are identical, the
optimal fine equals their wealthy •and the optimal probability of apprehension is such that there is some "under—

deterrence." If individuals differ by wealth, then the fine
for the high wealth group should exceed the fine for the low

wealth group. This is because it is optimal to underdeter
some individuals in Ue low wealth group, but this under—
deterrence can be reduced at no social cost for individuals
in the high wealth group by raising the fine for them.

When imprisonment is used alone and individuals are
identical, the optimal imprisonment term and the optimal
probability may be such that there is either underdeterrence

or overdeterrence. If individuals differ by wealth, the
optimal imprisonment term for the high wealth group may be

3

longer or shorter than the term for the low wealth group.

The explanation is that1 on the one hand, a given level of
deterrence can be achieved by a shorter imprisonment term
imposed on individuals in the high wealth group; on the
other hand, because of this, it is socially cheaper to
achieve a given level of deterrence for the higher wealth
group and therefore it may be worthwhile to employ imprisonment

to a greater extent for that group.
When fines and imprisonment are used together, the only
additional point is that, regardless of whether individuals
are identical, it is desirable to use the fine to its maximum
feasible extent before possibly supplementing it with an

imprisonment term." This is simply because fines are
socially costless while imprisonment is socially costly.

At the end of the paper we discuss informally how the
conclusions would be modified if individuals were risk

averse. The main difference is that, in general, the levels
of the sanctions should be lower and the probability of
apprehension should be higher than for risk neutral individuals
in order to reduce the bearing of risk.

4

II. The Model(

Individuals are assumed to be risk neutral and to be

identical except, possibly, in terms of their wealth. Each
individual faces a probability distribution of private gain
from engaging in an activity which imposes harm on others.

That is, what an individual would gain from engaging in the
activity depends on random factors but is known to him

before he has to decide whether to engage in it. (For
example, the gain to an individual from falsely reporting
his taxable income may depend on his need to purchase medical

services.) If an individual engages in the activity, he
faces. some probability of being caught and fined and/or

imprisoned. An individual will engage in the activity if
his private gain exceeds the expected sanction.

The following notation will be used to describe this
situation more precisely, where the gain and .the harm are

assumed to be monetary or to have monetary equivalents, and
the imprisonment term is assumed to have a monetary equivalent.

when wealth differs among individuals)

individuals)

Given this notation, an individual will engage in the activity

when

(1) g >

p(f

+

Thus, since the population size is normalized and set equal
to one, [1 -

H(p(f

+

ax))J

individuals will engage in the

activity.

As noted in the introduction, it is also assumed that
there is a cost to the public of imprisonment, namely the
cost of operating the jail system:
cost to the public per unit
of imprisonment term.
However, it is assumed that there is no cost to the public

of imposing fines. Regardless of the sanction used, there
is a cost of apprehending individuals:

c(p)

cost to the public of catching fraction
p of individuals who engage in the
activity (c' > 0).

6

Social

welfare is assumed to equal the sum of expected

utilities of individuals who, recall, •.are risk neutral.

Fines paid by individuals will not directly affect social
welfare because the loss of utility of the individuals
paying the fines is exactly offset by the gain in utility of

the individuals receiving the fine revenue. (Of course,
fines affect social welfare indirectly through their effect
on individuals' decisions whether to engage in the activity.)
Thus, social welfare W equals the gains from engaging in the
activity less the harm done, less the cost of catching
individuals, and less the private and public cost of imprison-

ment)&"

The problem to be considered in this paper is the maximization of social welfare through the choice of the fine f,
the imprisonment term x, and the probability of detection p.

The optimal values of the variables will be indicated by an
"*", and we will assume that these values are uniquely
determined

by the relevant first-order conditions.

III. Fines and Imprisonment When Individuals are
Identical

In this section we will first consider the optimal use

of fines and imprisonment separately, and then the optimal
use of the sanctions together.

A.

Fines Alone (x =

0)11/'

It is well known that when individuals are risk neutral,
the optimal fine, f*, epials their wealth, y.

If this were

not true, it would be possible to raise the fine and lower
the probability so as to achieve the same expected sanction

at a lower cost. To be precise, suppose that f* C y and
let k =

p*f*.

By raising f to y and lowering p to k/y, the

expected fine is unaffected, so that the number of individuals

engaging in the activity remains the same. Therefore, the
only effect on social welfare is through the cost of catching

individuals, which falls. Since, then, social welfare
rises, f* < y could not have been optimal.

Given that f* =

y,

the optimal probability is determined

by maximizing social welfare (2) with respect to p. The
resulting first-order condition can be written as

(3) (e—py)

dH(py) =

c'(p).

The right-hand side of this condition is, of course, the

marginal cost of raising the probability. The left-hand
side is the marginal benefit of raising the probability,

8

which equals the reduction in the number of individuals
engaging in the activity, dH(py)/dp, times the harm caused
by each net of benefits gained (at the margin), e -

py.

Note that (3) implies that e - py > 0; in other words,
it is optimal to have some degree of "underdeterreflce" in
the

sense

that some individuals who engage in the activity

obtaIn gains less than the harm they cause. To understand
why this is so, suppose f =

y

and p =

ely

so that the expected

fine equals e and there is no underdeterrence. Then, by
reducing p slightly the cost of enforcement is lowered.

Although the reduction in p now leads the marginal individuals
to engage in the activity, there is no (first-order) effect
on social welfare because they had been receiving gains
equal to e (since pf =

e).

Thus, it is optimal to lower p

to some extent)21'

B.

Imprisonment Alone (f = 0)

Given the probability p of catching individuals, the

imprisonment term is determined by the first-order
condition with respect to x:
optimal

The right-hand side of (4) is the marginal cost of increasing
the length of imprisonment and equals the private and public
cost of longer terms of those individuals already in jail,

9

)p{l

—

H(pax)],

less the savings in the private, and

public cost of imprisonment due to a reduced number of
individuals who engage in the activity and are caught,
(a +

p)pxdH(pax)/dx.

The left-hand side of (4) is the

marginal benefit of increasing the imprisonment term and
equals the reduction in the number of individuals engaging
in the activity, dH(pax)/dx, times the harm caused by each
net of benefits gained, e - pax.
Note that (4) implies that there may be underdeterrence
or overdeterrence (since the right-hand, side may be positive

or negative). In other words, it may be the case.that some
individuals engaging in the activity obtain gains that are
less than the harm they cause, or that some individuals who
are deterred from engaging in the activity would have received

gains greater than the harm they would have caused. To
understand why this is so, suppose the imprisonment term is
at a level such that px =

e.

Since there is then no (first-

order) effect on social welfare due to changes in the behavior
of the marginal individuals, x should be changed in the
direction that reduces the private and public cost of im-

prisonment. Lowering x reduces the cost of imprisonment per
person in jail but increases the number of persons in jail.
If the former effect is more important than the latter

effect, then it will be desirable to lower x. Otherwise, it

will

be preferable to raise x.

The optimal probability is determined by the following
first-order condition:

The interpretation of this condition is similar to that of
condition (3) determining the optimal probability in the

case of fines alone. However, now the benefit of a reduction
in the number of individuals engaging in the activity due to
an increase in the probability includes a savings in the
private and public costs of irnprisorunent, (or + 13)X.

Also,

the cost of an increase in the probability now includes an
increase in the private and public cost of imprisonment due
to the apprehension of a greater fraction of those engaging
in the activity, (a +

Fines and Imprisonment

Assuming that both fines and imprisonment may be used
to affect individuals' behavior, it is always optimal first
to use a fine to the fullest extent possible--equal to
individuals' wealth, as in the case of fines alone--before
possibly supplementing it with an imprisonment term.

The

reason for this is simply that because the fine is a socially
costless means of enforcement, it is advantageous to use it
to its limit before using a socially costly means of enforcement.
To demonstrate this, suppose, to the contrary, that
f* c y and x' >

0.

Then the expected sanction is p(f* +

constant the expected sanction. The only effect on social
welfare (2) is to reduce the private and social cost of
imprisonment, (a +

p)px[1

-

H(p(f

+

ax))].

Thus, the optimal

fine cannot be less than wealth if imprisonment is used. We
have already shown that if imprisonment is not used, the
fine should also equal wealth.

If it is optimal to supplement a fine with an imprisonment term, the choices of the probability and the imprisonment

are determined by first-order conditions with interpretations similar to those in the cases of fines and imprisonterm

ment alone.

IV.

Fines and Imprisonment when Individuals Differ

Wealth

In

this section we will reexamine the optimal use of

fines and imprisonment when individuals have different

levels of wealth. For simplicity, it is assumed that there
are only two levels of wealth, Yi C y2; let A be the fraction

of individuals with wealth Yi• It is also assumed that
the sanctions can differ for the two groups——denoted by
subscripts on f and on x--but that the probability of apprehension

is the same for both groups.1 It is further assumed that
the private cost of imprisonment is lower for the low wealth
group, that is, a1 C a2.'' Thus, social welfare now is

is equal to their wealth and that the fine for

wealth group is larger but not necessarily equal to

their wealth. The reasoning behind this result can be
explained roughly as follows. By an argument similar to
that used in the previous section, it will first be demonstrated that the fine for the lower wealth group is equal to

13

their wealth and that there is underdeterrence of this

group. Thus, if the fine were the same for the higher
wealth group, they too would be underdeterred.

Since it is

obviously possible to impose a larger fine on the higher
wealth group, the underdeterrence of this group can be

reduced at no social cost. However, because raising the
fine to their wealth might result in overdeterrence of them,

it may not be desirable to raise the fine to that level.
To demonstrate that f1* =

Yi'

assume, to the contrary,

that f1* C y. Suppose first that f2* C y2. Now consider a
p slightly less than p' and an f1 and an f2 slightly greater

than f1* and f2*, respectively, such that pf1 =
pf2 =

p*f2*.

and

(It is possible to raise f1 and f2 since

f1* C y1 and f2*

Y2•) Since the expected sanction is the

same under p, f1 and f2 and since p < p, social welfare
must have risen, which contradicts the presumed optimality

of f1* < y. Now suppose that f2* = Y2•
p*f2* must be less than or equal to e.

Observe first that
This is because if

a reduction in f2 to the point where p*f2 =

B. Imprisonment Alone
Given the probability of catching individuals, two
firtht.-order conditions analogous to (4)

determine the optimal

imprisonment terms for the low and high wealth groups.

The

imprisOnment term for the high wealth group might be less

than the term for the low wealth group. This possibility
reflects the fact that in order to achieve a given expected
sanction, the required imprisonment term for the high wealth
group is less than the required term for the low wealth

group)" However, it is also possible that the optimal
imprisonment term is greater for the higher wealth group.
This might occur because imprisonment is a more "cost-

15

effective" deterrent of the wealthy group-—to achieve a
given level of deterrence, the private cost of imprisonment
is the same for
the

wealthier

both groups

but the public cost is less for

group since a shorter imprisonment term is

required for them.'
Given

the two imprisonment

terms, the optimal probability

is determined by a first—order condition analogous to (5),
with a similar interpretation.

C.

Fines and Imprisonment
If both fines and imprisonment are used, then for each

group it is always optimal first to use a fine--equal to the
wealth of the members of that group--before possibly supple-

menting it with an imprisonment term. The reason is the
same as the one discussed in the previous section when there
was only one group of individuals; since the proof is virtually

identical, it is omitted. Also, the first—order conditions
determining the optimal imprisonment terms, if they are
positive, and the first-order condition determining the

probability are similar to those discussed in the
previous section and have similar interpretations.

V.

The Implicationsóf Risk Aversion

If individuals are risk averse, then one woull expect

the optimal sanction-—whether a fine or an imprisonment
term--would be lower than it would be if individuals were

that

risk neutral and that the optimal

probability of apprehension

would be higher. This is because the problem of maximizing
social welfare would have to take into account the
imposed on individuals subject to the

risk

sanction.-

Assuming that aversion to risk decreases with income,
one would also expect that the optimal fine imposed on the
high wealth group would be even larger relative to the fine
imposed on the low wealth group than when individuals are

risk neutral. The reason for this is that because the high
wealth group is less risk averse, it is optimal for there to
be less of a reduction iii the level of the sanction from the

level that would be appropriate if individuals were risk
neutral.

Finally, if individuals are risk averse, the point that
• fines should be used to their fullest possible extent before

imprisonment is used is not affected. The explanation is
the same as when individuals were assumed to be risk neutral.
