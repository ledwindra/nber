Over the past 25 years countries have increasingly turned to antidumping in order to offer protection to import-competing industries.  Antidumping is a trade policy where the institutional process surrounding the investigation and determinations has significant impacts beyond the antidumping duty we observe, and where the filing decision, the legal determination, and the protective impact are all endogenous with firms' decisions in the market, leading to a wealth of potential strategic actions and distorted market outcomes.  This theme underlies our discussion as we review the literature in three broad areas connected with different phases of the antidumping trade policy process: 1) pre-investigation, 2) investigation, and 3) post-investigation.\n\n",
