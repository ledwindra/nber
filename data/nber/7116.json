The same is true when  macro' data is obtained by aggregating over time and across people.  This equivalence means that the indivisibility of labor per se does not have implications for macroeconomics.  Nor does indivisibility have  aggregate' normative implications. I then build a micro model of the bunching of work in continuous time as the consequence of fixed costs and  fatigue effects.' Only in a special case does the micro model has as its reduced form the indivisible labor model.  In other cases, the bunching of work in time may have unique macro implications.  Indivisible and bunching models of labor are shown to have implications for public finance.\n\n",
