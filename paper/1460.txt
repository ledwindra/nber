An Examination of Aggregate Price Uncertainty in
Four Countries and Some Implications for Real Output

ABSTRACT

This study constructs measures of aggregate price uncertainty for four
industrialized countries (Canada, West Germany, Great Britain, and the United
States) and attempts to assess the extent to which more rapid and more variable
price changes appear to have contributed to increased aggregate price

uncertainty. For this purpose we examine the relationship across countries and
through time between the rate of inflation, inflation variability, and our

measures of price uncertainty. In addition we use our measures of price
uncertainty to examine the hypothesis, variously put forward by Marshall, Keynes,

Milton Friedman, and Okun, that higher aggregate price uncertainty is likely to

result in lower real output and higher unemployment. Our results suggest that
the higher and more variable inflation of the 1970s did increase uncertainty
about the aggregate price level in Canada, Great Britain and the United States,

but the evidence for West Germany would not sustain such a conclusion. Finally,
we did find evidence of a significant negative output effect of aggregate price
uncertainty for Canada and the United Kingdom, but not for the United States or
West Germany.

I. Introduction
An important consideration in evahiating the costs of price
level instability is the degree to which s-uch instability increases

uncertainty about the aggregate price level. Many costs of movements
in the aggregate price level pertain only' to unanticipated changes.1

These costs nc1ude random incone distribution effects and some
(though not all) of the irtsallocations of resources attributed to

price level instability', During the past two decades th.e United

States and a number of other industrialized countries have experienced

both more rapid and ore variable rates of price change. This

study assesses th degree to whch these more rapid and 'more
variable price changes have caused increased aggregate price
uncertainty.,

2

Quarterly measures of price uncertainty are constructed for
Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States and West Germany for

the time period from 1965 to the early 1980s. The measure of
uncertainty is the error variance of the one—s.tep ahead prediction

of the price level based on a simple model containing both
aggregate supply and demand factors——a modified version of. . the Lucas
(1973) model.

The organization of the paper is as follows. Section II
presents the model. Section III explain.s the uncertainty measure.

Section IV considers some details of the empirical specification

of the model's price equation. Section V presents our empirical
results. Section VI compares our measures of uncertainty with
those of earlier studies, particularly those of Robert Engle (1982,

1983), for the United States and United Kingdom. Section VII
examines the relationship between our measures of aggregate

price uncertainty and the level of real output. Section VIU

summarizes our results

3

II. The Model
The model from which we derive our price prediction equation
is similar to that used by Lucas (1973), as amended by Cukierman
and Wachtel (1979) and Froyen and Waud (1983).

A. Market Sjpp ly Egations
We assume the economy is composed of a large number of

scattered, competitive markets. For each of these markets we
derive short—run output supply schedules based on factor demand
equations for labor and for an energy (or, alternatively a more
general raw material) input, as well as labor supply functions at
the individual ?market level. The factor demand equations are log
linear functions of the product price, input prices and the fixed
stock of capital. Labor supply. in each market is assumed to be a
log linear function of the money wage in that market and the laborers'
expectation of the general price level (conditioned on information.

in that market). This expectation is modeled below.
To solve for individual market supply functions, the labor
supply function is first used to substitutethe money wage out of

the factor demand functions. The resulting equations express the
quantities of labor and energy as functions of product price,

4

laborers' expectations of the aggregate price level, the price

of energy, and the capital stock. These equations are then
substituted into the production function for each market to yield
the supply functions2

We take x. to be measured by nominal income, assuming the aggregate

C. Expectations Formation
Current market specific product price is used together with

information to form an optimal expectation of the
aggregate price p.4 This optimal expectation (in individual
aggregate

market

v) is given by

p = (l—o)p(v)
where

+

is the expectation of aggregate price conditional on

information prior to time period t, i.e., conditional on available

aggregate information, and 0 is a function of the variances of
market specific and aggregate demand shocks as well as other
variances and parameters to be introduced below.

D. The Aggregate Price Equation
To solve for the equilibrium price level, we first compute a

quasi—reduced—form expression aggregating over the equilibrium price

levels (p(v)) for the individual markets. This is a quasi—reducedform expression in that it still contains

we compute .

From this expression

We substitute the result back into the condition

for the equilibrium aggregate price level to obtain the reduced
form price equation.5

disturbances

7

III. The Measure of Uncertainty
Our purpose is to measure the degree to which economic agents,
using available data, were able to predict the behavior of the

aggregate price level. For this reason we have chosen an uncertainty
measure based upon a period by period or "rolling regression"
technique rather than an estimate based on the whole sample period.

Economic agents are assumed to use a generalized least squares
(GLS) procedure to estimate the parameters of the aggregate price

equation based on past data. The error variance of the one
period ahead GLS predictor for the aggregate price level is computed

as a measure of aggregate price uncertainty. A GLS procedure is
used since examination of estimated residuals of our price
prediction equation, described in Section IV revealed a pattern

of first—order autocorrelation. It seems reasonable to infer that
such autocorrelation would be taken into account in price
forecasts, though the autocorrelation coefficient is assumed to
be estimated each period along with the other coefficients in the
equation.

The individual economic agent in time period (t). is assumed

to predict the aggregate—price level one period ahead (t+l). The
error variance of the GLS predictor can be expressed, in general
notation, as [Goldberger (1962), Theil (1971, p. 282)]

U =

2(1p2) + a2(—p)'(X'Vx)(—p)

(12)

where X is the TxK matrix of observations on the independent variables

in the particular forecast equation; where

8

=

[xtl,...,xtK}

=

with

p

being the first order autocorrelation coefficient and with

a2(X'V1X)1 the covariance matrix of the GLS coefficient
estimator.

[V is defined in Theil (1971), p. 252).]

IV. Empirical p4ficion of the price Prediction Eguation

The following adjustments were made to equation (6) prior
to constructing our uncertainty measures.

A. An Output Adjustment Lag
As implemented empirically, the Lucas-type output equation has
generally included the lagged value of cyclical output to capture
the persistence in deviations of output from the natural rate.
Rationales for such persistence have been offered in Lucas (1975)
and Sargent (1977)

If for given levels of nominal income and the

supply variable output in a given time period depends pcsitively
on the lagged deviation of output from trend, then correspondingly
the price level will depend negatively on this lagged deviation of

output from trend. To capture this influence we include the lagged
deviation of output from trend as an independent variable in our
price equation.

B.

-

The Capital Stock and Trend in the Supply Variable
The capital stock term (Kt) in (6) is assumed to follow a

linear time trend. We also assume that this time trend represents
the effects of systematic movements in the relative price of energy,

(t), in (6).

9

C. Partial Indexing of Energy Prices
The energy (or import) price specification given by (8) in
Section II.D presumes that energy prices were fully indexed to the

aggregate price level. There is of course no formal indexing of
energy prices. Equation (8) presumes that, allowing for the
factors that cause the relative price of energy products to change
in a systematic way (4(t)) and in the absence of supply shocks

=

0),

producers of the energy input would increase price

proportionately with the domestic price level. If we suppose instead
that indexing is only partial, equation (8) would be replaced by
=

where

"

+ (l-.1p)z + (t) +

(8')

is another predetermined variable (the average of other

countries' price levels, for example) and 0 < P

<

1.

Within our model, the implication of replacing (8) with (8')

is that with the energy price given by (8') the coefficient on

xi in (6) is no longer one. The coefficient is instead
o <

<

1

.

1—g20—g3

(13)

Price rises less than proportionately with an anticipated increase
in aggregate demand (xt_i), for example, because output also rises.
Output rises because the increase in aggregate demand and, therefore,

the price level lowers the real price of the energy input and
stimulates aggregate supply.

V. Results
Our measures of uncertainty are derived on the basis of the
price equation (6), using all available information, and with the

10

adjustments discussed in the previous subsection. This price
prediction equation can be written as

For a given quarter economic agents will be assumed to have
estimated (14) through the preceding period using the 32 most

recent quarterly data observations. There is an element of

arbitrariness in this choice of sample period. Eight years of past
data seem to be a reasonable nuniber of observations to characterize

recent price behavior which economic agents might view as re1evat
to current price determination.

For Canada, the United Kingdom

and the United States these estimates of the price prediction equation.

begin in 1965:2. The last quarter for which we compute a measure

11

of uncertainty is 1982:3 for Canada, 1982:2 for the United

Kingdom and 1983:1 for the United States. The data for these
three countries began in 1957:1 but one observation is lost in
differencing x and computing lagged values for x, y, and U;

then

32 observations are used to obtain the beginning estimate of the

price prediction equation. For West Germany consistent data series
were available starting in 1960:1, so the first period for which

we compute a measure of price uncertainty is 1968:2. The last
observation for West Germany is 1982:4.9h1°

Figures 1—4 show the uncertainty statistics for each of the

four countries. The uncertainty measures in these figures are for
the energy price measures of the supply shock, except for the case
of West Germany where only the import price data were available.
For the three countries for which both measures of the supply shock
were available, the uncertainty statistics based on the import
and energy price measures were quite similar.

To assess the interrelationship between aggregate price uncertainty
and both the level and variance of inflation we examine the behavior
of the uncertainty statistic both across countries and through time.
To begin, we consider the general pattern of the uncertainty statistic

as illustrated in Figures 1—4. Below we look at some correlation
coefficients between the variables of interest.

A. Patterns of Aggregate Price Uncertainty
The most striking similarity in the behavior of our price
uncertainty measures across countries is the "spike" in the
series that comes with the rapid increase in energy (and other

raw materials) prices in the 1973—74 period. The inflation caused

by the supply shocks of the mid-1970s clearly increased aggregate
price uncertainty in all four countries.
A feature common to the experience of Canada, the United

Kingdom and the United States, but not to West Germany, is another
sharp rise in price uncertainty later in the 1970s, although the

timing of this second peak in the series differs across the three
countries.

In the United States the second sharp increase in price

uncertainty comes in 1978 and coincides with a renewed upward trend

in the inflation rate. Uncertainty then remains high even when the

inflation rate declines in 1982. In the United Kingdom the second
period of rapidly rising price uncertainty also coincided with an

acceleration in the rate of inflation. In contrast to the United
States, price uncertainty in the United Kingdom declined near the

end of the period as the inflation rate fell sharply. In Canada
the second jump in price uncertainty began in 1976, before there was

an acceleration in the inflation rate, but this upward trend in price
uncertainty sharpened as the inflation rate accelerated over the 1979—
82 period.

Price uncertainty in West Germany followed a course after 1975

that was quite different from that in other countries. Once the
immediate effects of the supply shock dissipated, price uncertainty

fell to levels similar to those of the 1968—72 period. This is
concident with a period of low stable inflation rates in West

Germany. (During the 1976-82 period the West German inflation rate
was in each year within the range of 3.4% to 4.8%.)
To summarize, the supply shocks of the mid-1970s appear to
have increased aggregate price uncertainty in all four of the

13

countries in our sample. Over the rest of the 1970s and early
l980s in the countries where inflation again accelerated there was
a second period when aggregate price uncertainty increased rapidly.

In West Germany where aggregate price uncertainty declined to pre—
1970 level and remained there, the inflation rate had also declined

and remained stable throughout the rest of the period. On the surface
then our evidence on the behavior of price uncertainty is consistent
with the view that more rapid and variable rates of change in the

price level will create increased price uncertainty. The next
section examines this view in more detail.

B. Relationships Between Price Uncertainty and the Level and
Variability of Inflation
Table 1 shows correlation coefficients, for each of the four
countries, between the price uncertainty measures based on the
energy (UE) and import (U1) supply shock variables and

measures of the inflation rate and of inflation variability.U
The inflation rate is, as above, simply the change in the log of
the aggregate price level

In any one period, we observe only

one outcome from the distribution of the inflation rate and this
alone is not enough to measure changes in inflation variability over

time. As a proxy for a time—varying
moving variance of actual inflation rates,

we construct a
.

At

each point

in time we have computed a variance using observations from the
past 8 period (quarters).

The correlation coefficients in Table 1 show a positive
association between aggregate price uncertainty and both the level

and variability of the inflation rate for Canada, the United Kingdom

and the United States. For West Germany, there is no significant
correlation between aggregate price uncertainty and either the
level or variability of the inflation rate.

To examine further the relationship between price uncertainty
and the level and varibility of the inflation rate in Canada, the
United Kingdom and the United States, we compute subperiod averages
for these variables and compare movements in them between subperiods.
The two subperiods are 1965:2-1972:4 and 1973:1 to the end of

the sample period for each country. The same comparison cannot be
made with West Germany since the data began several years later.

What we did find by breaking the available West German data (1968:2—
1982:4) into various subperiods is that there is very little
variation across subperiods in inflation uncertainty, the mean
inflation rate or the moving variance of inflation.

Table 2 shows subperiod averages of UE? U1, ô and p, as
well as their ratios between subperiods (UE2/UE,lI for example,
where 2 and 1 denote the later and earlier subperiods, respectively).
The data are consistent with a positive association between
aggregate price uncertainty and both the level and variability of

the inflation rate. In each of the three countries the data
indicate that aggregate price uncertainty, the level of the
inflation rate and the variability of inflation all rose between the

first and second subperiod. Notice also that if we look across the
three countries the data also suggest a positive relationship among
price uncertainty, the level of the inflation rate and the variability

of inflation. The United Kingdom has the highest inflation rate in
each subperiod and also the most variable inflation rate and the

16

highest level of price uncertainty. Canada is second in each of

these respects in ch subperiod, and the United States is third.
For the second subperiod, data are available to add West

Germany to this cross—country comparison. West Germany does not
conform to the pattern of the other three countries. West Germany
had the lowest average inflation rate among the four countries
and 3rd in inflation variability, but ranked 2nd
in the level of price uncertainty.

VI. Comparison With Other Measures of Uncertainty
There have been a number of previous studies on the
relationships among aggregate price uncertainty, inflation variability,
and the level of inflation. In this section we compare our results

with previous findings.'2

A. Cross—Country Evidence
John Taylor (1981) examined a sample of 7 countries and found that
a measure of inflation forecast uncertainty was positively related

to both inflation variability and the level of inflation. Our
measures of uncertainty for Canada, the United Kingdom, and the

United States exhibit this pattern. West Germany is somewhat of an
outlier

from this pattern.

Other studies of price uncertainty focus on individual

countries. None of these consider Canada or West Germany. We
discuss studies of the United States and United Kingdom in turn.

B. The United States
Two approaches have been taken previously in looking at the
relationship between price uncertainty and the variability and

level of inflation.

Cukierman and Wachtel (1979) use the variance across survey
respondents from the Livingston and Survey Research Corporation
surveys of inflationary expectations as measures of inflation

uncertainty. They find that the variance of expected inflation
is positively related to the variance of inflation. Stanley Fisher
(1981) finds a positive relationship between this variance within

the cross—section of forecasters (in both surveys) and the actual

inflation rate. Our results are consistent with this evidence
from survey data.

The second approach is that of Robert Engle (1983). Engle
assumes that the error term from an inflation forecasting equation
follows an autoregressive conditional heteroschedastic (ARCH) process.
Such a process captures the assumed tendency of shocks to inflation

to bunch up. Uncertainty is measured as the conditional variance
of the error term from the forecast equation at each point in time.
Engle's results differ from the results that use survey data in
two respects.

First, Engle finds much less of an increase in price uncertainty
in the 1970s than is indicated by the cross-sectional variance of

forecasts in the surveys. Engle concludes that the increased inflation
and more variable inflation of the 1970s was for the most part pre-

dictable. Second, Engle finds no significant relationship between
his measure of inflation uncertainty and the (lagged) level of the

inflation rate. He points out that this is in contradiction to
Friedman's view that the higher inflation of the 1970s led to more
inflation uncertainty and a rise in the natural rate of unemployment.

19

In terms of the estimated increase in the respective measures
of price uncertainty, Engle's estimate is substantially lower than

ours. Comparing averages over the subperiods we used in Table 2,
with the second subperiod shortened to 1973:1—1979:4 (the end
point for Engle's estimates), Engle's measure of inflation uncertainty

(GNP deflator) rose 16.5 percent between subperiods. Our measure
(energy price supply shock variable) rose by 85.0. Our results
also differ from Engle's in that we do find a significant positive
relationship between price uncertainty and the level of the
inflation rate.

To get at the source of the differences between Engle's
results •and ours, we have reestimated our model using the ARCH

.

in Figure 5, for the energy measure of the supply shock. The
correlation coefficient between this price uncertainty measure and
the level of the inflation rate is lower than for the measure
based on the rolling regression approach, 0.33 compared to 0.53,

but still significant. For the import measure of the supply shock
the correlation between the ARCH uncertainty measure and the rate
of inflation is insignificant (0.07), while using the rolling

regression technique there is a significant correlation (0.52).

For the United States then, ARCH estimates of aggregate price
uncertainty are less closely related to the level of inflation than
are the estimates derived from the rolling regression approach,
even when the same model is used in both approaches.

Still, the discrepancies between our results and Engle's

should not be overstated. If we extend our sample period back to
the late 1940s and early 1950s, we find, as did Erigle, that price

uncertainty during this earlier period was substantially greater

than in any later period, including the mid-1970s. The behavior
of the price level in the 1970s was much more predictable than over

the 1947—53 period. Second, while our measure of uncertainty
shows a larger increase on the 1970s than Engle's (86% compared to

16%). Our estimate of the increase in uncertainty is much closer to
Engle's than to the much larger rise evidenced in the survey
based measures [see the Tables in Engle (1983, p. 296) and Cukierman

and Wachtel (1979, p. 604)]. Finally, if one correlates Engle's
measure of inflation uncertainty with the current, rather than the
lagged inflation rate, there is a positive significant realtionship
(correlation coefficient = 0.354) between the two variables.

C. The United Kingdom
Engle (1982) applies the ARCH technique to estimate inflation

uncertainty for the United Kingdom over the 1958-1977 period. He
finds that inflation uncertainty increased substantially in the 1970s

as the rate of inflation accelerated. This is in accord with our
results using the rolling regression technique. However, when we test
for ARCH effects using our model over the 1965:2-1982:2 period,

we find no evidence of such.'4

21

Our estimates, therefore, imply that the pattern of price
uncertainty in the United Kingdom (as measured by our model)

is not well characterized by the ARCH specification. A possible
reason for our failure to find ARCH effects in the United Kingdom

is that our model includes a supply shock variable while Engl&s
does not. In Engle's model, the full effect of supply shocks

will be measured in the error term. In our model, the auto—
correlated part will be attributed to the lagged energy (or

import) price variable. In this regard it is worth noting that
one interpretation of the ARCH model advanced by Engle (1982,

p. 990), is that "The ARCH specification might then be picking up
the effect of variables omitted form the estimated model."

22

VII. Price Uncertainty and Real Output
Here we apply our estimates to test the hypothesis, suggested by
Marshall, Keynes, Friedman arid Okun, among others, that an increase

in aggregate price uncertainty will lower the level of real output)5
For this purpose we estimate the output equation implied by •.the

model presented in Section II, with the addition of price
uncertainty as a determinant of the "natural" rate of real output.

As in earlier versions of this model [Lucas (1973), Cukierman
and Wachtel (1979), and Froyen and Waud (1983)], real output can
be broken into two parts: the natural rate of output

and a

cyclical component (ycti

+

In the model, with, the addition of aggregate price uncertainty,

the specification for the natural rate becomes
+

g3c(t)+ g4K +
<1

The natural rate of output depends on the systematic movement in

the relative price of energy or, alternatively, imports (Ct)),
the capital stock

and on the level of aggregate price

uncertainty cu1 relative to some 1ong-run norm (tJ).

The cyclical component of output depends on the behavior of
the demand (Ix—•t) and supply shocks (i) in the model, as follows'6

Prior to estimating an equation for real output, we make the
same adjustments that were made to the price equation in Section IV;

namely, we allow for an output adjustment lag by including the
lagged deviation of output from trend as a explanatory variable
and we use a linear time trend to proxy for the systematic movements
in the relative price of energy as well as for growth in the capital

stock. Additionally, exam±natia-jof the data suggested that x
contained a statistically significant upward trend in several countries,

instead of having a constant mean (5) specified in equation (4). To allow
for this we respecify the aggregate demand shock as the detrended
change in the log of nominal income

Estimates of Equation (17) for each of the four countries

in our study are given in Table 3. The sample period is that for
which we have estimates of price uncertainty in each country as

shown in the first column of the table. Part A contains estimates
where the supply shock and price uncertainty measure are both

based on the energy price measure of the supply shock. Part B
is based on the import measure. For each country, equation (17)

was initially estimated by ordinary least squares. Where Durbin's
(1970) h statistic showed evidence of autocorrelation, (at the 5%

level of significance) the equation was reestimated using the
modified "three pass least squares" procedure suggested by Wallis

(1967). For these estimates the value of the first—order autocorrelation

coefficient p) is shown in the table.
For eth.er the estimates based on the energy or import price
measures of the supply shock, the price uncertainty variable is
significant with a negative sign for Canada and the United Kingdom.

With

either measure

of the supply shock for the United States,

the price uncertainty' variable has the expected negative sign but is

not s'ignificant, 'or Germany, where there are only estimates for
the import measure of the supply' shock, the price uncertainty

measure is also insignificant, though with a negative sign.'8
There have been a n-umber of previous studies of the reLationship
betwee.n either output or employment and the level of price
uncertainty' to which, our results may be compared. There are no previous

studies of the relationship between output and aggregate price
uncertainty, for Canada of

with those of our earlier study, Froyen and Waud (1984), which used
a moving variance of the inflation rate to measure aggregate price

uncertainty and found significant negative output effects for that
variable.

Our results are not consistent with those of several studies
for the United States that have found significant negative effects

on output or employment for measurof price uncertainty. These
previous studies [Levi and Makin (1980), Mullineaux (1980), Makin
(1982fl used the standard deviation across inflation forecasts from the
Livingston survey as a proxy for inflation uncertainty.20

Our model differs from the models in these studies in that ours

includes a supply shock variable. For the United States this variable
was significant and the estimate of the coefficient on the price uncertainty measure, especially' for the equation using the energy price

measur was sensitive to this variable.. When it isdropped from theeqation,
the price uncertainty measure has a negative coefficient, significant
at the 10 percent level (t =

1.90). 21

The other important difference between our estimates and those
of previous studies for the United States is the sample period.. Levi

and Makin (1980), Mullineaux (1980) and Makin (l982 estimate
equations for sample period beginning in the late 1940s or in the

1950s and extending to the mid—1970s. Our period begins much later
(1965:2) and extends to 1983:1.22

The disparity between our results and those of earlier studies for
the United States, using survey data, suggests the usefulness of
examining whether estimates using such survey measures, extended to a
later period and controlling for supply shocks, would continue to show
significant negative output effects for inflation uncertainty.

27

viii. conclusion
In Canada, the United Kingdom, arid the United States, our

measures show an increase in aggregate uncertainty during the period

of supply shocks, 1973-74. After a decline in 1975—76, price
uncertainty rose again as inflation accelerated in these countries

later in the decade of the 1970s. Looking both across these
countries or at the pattern of price uncertainty for each country

through time, our results indicate that there was a positive
association between the level of aggregate price uncertainty and

both the level and variability of the inflation rate. These
results suggest that the higher and more variable inflation of the
1970s did increase uncertainty about the aggregate price level.

In West Germany aggregate price uncertainty also rose sharply

with the oil price shock in 1974. The rise was temporary, however,
and price uncertainty quickly declined back to, and at times below,

pre—1974 levels. The low and stable inflation rate in West Germany
during the post-1974 period may explain this rapid decline in price

uncertainty. The lack of much variability in the inflation rate
may also explain why ,

in

contrast to the other three countries, we
could detect no significant relationship between the level of price

uncertainty and either the level or moving variance of the
inflation rate in West Germany.

28

Estimates of the effect of inflation uncertainty on the level

of real output differed across countries. For Canada and the United
Kingdom, we did find evidence of a significant negative output effect

for increases in aggregate price uncertainty. For West Germany and
the United States our measures of aggregate price uncertainty did not
have significant estimated output effects.

Appendix to Froyen and Waud (1983).

3mis assumption simplifies the analysis considerably since with
it no detailed specification of the elements of aggregate demand

is required. Since this assumption results in the assumed
exogeneity of nominal income, its validity is crucial to the

consistent estimation of the model. For our measures of price uncertainty,
the exogeneity of nominal income is not, however, crucial because the
forecast equations we estimate contain only lagged values of both

aggregate demand and supply shocks. These values are predetermined
in any case. For the income equations estimated in Section VII, the
exogeneity of

is important. Specification tests in Froyen and

Waud (1984) provide support for this assumption for the United

Kingdom. Nelson's (1979) (1981) results provide support for this
assumption for the United States.

There is a different p in each market. We supress the. v

subscript here to make clear that this is an expectation of the
aggregate price level.

51n deriving (6) we also assume that a proportional increase
in product price and the prices of each of the two variable
factors of production leaves desired output supply unchanged.

It can be shown that this assumption implies g1 =

-(g2

+ g3) in

equation 1.

6Equation (8) assumes that energy prices are fully indexed
to the aggregate price level (the coefficient Ofl Pt IS one).

We have also examined the case where energy prices are only partially
indexed (the coefficient on Pt in (8) is between zero and one).
In this latter case aggregate demand management policy can,

by changing p, affect the real price of energy. The potential
role of monetary policy in this case is analyzed by Blinder (1981).
The implications of partial indexing of energy prices for our
price prediction equation are discussed in Section IV.C.
7See the Appendix to Froyen and Waud (1983), equation (vi).
8Over the latter part of the saxtple period there is evidence

of an upward trend in x in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the

United States. Such a deterministic part of the aggregate demand
shock would be predictable to economic agents.

This trend will also

be picked up in our estimates by the time variable in equation

each of the four countries, are given in Appendix 1. These whole

data quite well.

'°For Canada and the U.S. the energy price measure is the
producer (or wholesale) price index for fuels, related products

and electricity. For the United Kingdom the energy price
series is the index of "Basic Materials and Fuel Used in

Manufacturing Industry". In each case the relative price
of energy is computed by deflating each index by the GNP deflator.

For each country the relative price of imports is measured as the

index of import prices deflated by the GNP deflator. For all
variables other than energy prices, data are from the IMF,

11Fischer (1981, p. 29) points out that a procedure such as

ours implies no link between expected inflation and aggregate

price uncertainty. Tests of the relationship between the level of
the inflation rate and the level of price uncertainty are
therefore implicitly tests of whether a higher inflation rate meant
that more of the change in the price level was unexpected.
12There is also a considerable literature on the related

question of whether higher inflation is, in general, accompanied

by more variability in the inflation rate. See, for example,

the survey in Taylor (1981). The discussion here is confined to
previous studies which focused explicitly on price level and
inflation uncertainty.

13For this estimation we have followed the iterative procedure
outlined in Engle (1982, pp. 996-98) with the exception that at

each iteration three scoring steps for the c coefficient are made.

Overall three iterations are run (3 estimates of .

of the ARCH model (p) is two for the estimate using the energy
measure of the supply shock and 1 with the import measure.

'4Up to 8 lags were used in tests for ARCH effects. The
test is described in Engle (1982, p. 1000).

15Marshall and Keynes clearly suggest a relationship between
output and aggregate price uncertainty.

Friedman and Okun proposed the

relationship between price variability and output or employment.
Such price variability affects output in Friedman's view, for

example, partly through the creation of price uncertainty, but

perhaps by broader channels as well. Tests of Friedman's hypotheses
such as those by Levi and Makin (1980), Mullineaux (1980) and Makin
(1982) have all employed measures of price uncertaint4 relying on the
close relationship between variability and uncertainty.

the modification of the model in Section IV to allow for
only partial indexing of energy (or import) prices, the coefficient

on x1 in the price equation will be less than one and, therefore, x1
will have a nonzero coefficient on the output equation. In our
estimates of the price equation for the whole sample period (Appendix

1), the coefficient on x1 was significantly different from one in only
one case (Canada using the energy price measure of the supply shocki,

17me trend in the supply variable, (t), will affect only the
trend in real output and, therefore, is not included in (17). The
supply shock is entered as a single variable in (17), rather than as

separate variables measuring anticipated (Xpt]) and unanticipated

components (see equation lO. Since, in the model, the
anticipated and unanticipated component have somewhat different
effects on price and output (see (6)), it would be preferable to

enter them as separate variables. Previous attempts to measure
these separate effects, however, did not prove fruitful (see
Froyen and Waud (1983, note 18) and Froyen and Waud (1984, p. 61)).

18Since our measures of price uncertainty, using the rolling

regression procedure, are generated solely on the basis of lagged
observations on squared residuals and the independent variables in
the model (see equation (12)), the coefficient estimates for (17)

will be consistent. The standard errors for the coefficients
will not, however, reflect the fact that the uncertainty variable

is generated rather than being directly observed. For a discussion
of these issues, see Pagan (.1984, pp. 241-42).

19Buck and Gahlen (1984) examine the relationship between
relative price variability and both output and employment for

West Germany for 1953—77. They find that increased relative price
variability lowers output and employment. For a similar finding
for the United States, see Blejer and Leiderman (1980).
20Mullineaux (1980) also used a moving standard deviation of

the inflation rate as a measure of uncertainty. Withthatmeasure,
his results, concerning the negative output effects of inflation
uncertainty were mixed.

21For the specification using the import price measure of the
supply shock, the coefficient on price uncertainty remained
insignificant even when the supply shock variable itself was
dropped from the equation.
221fl

Froyen and Waud (1983) we found that a moving variance

of the inflation rate had a significant negative effect on real cmtput

in the United States over the 1957—68 period, but not over the19pe.
A measure of the variability of either energy or import prices did
have a negative significant output effect over this later period
suggesting the importance of supply shocks.
