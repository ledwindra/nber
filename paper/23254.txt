ABSTRACT
We assume that perfectly patient agents estimate the value of future events by generating noisy,
unbiased simulations and combining those signals with priors to form posteriors. These posterior
expectations exhibit as-if discounting: agents make choices as if they were maximizing a stream
of known utils weighted by a discount function, D(t). This as-if discount function reflects the fact
that estimated utils are a combination of signals and priors, so average expectations are optimally
shaded toward the mean of the prior distribution, generating behavior that partially mimics the
properties of classical time preferences. When the simulation noise has variance that is linear in
the event's horizon, the as-if discount function is hyperbolic, D(t)=1/(1+at). Our agents exhibit
systematic preference reversals, but have no taste for commitment because they suffer from
imperfect foresight, which is not a self-control problem. In our framework, agents that are more
skilled at forecasting (e.g., those with more intelligence) exhibit less discounting. Agents with
more domain-relevant experience exhibit less discounting. Older agents exhibit less discounting
(except those with cognitive decline). Agents who are encouraged to spend more time thinking
about an intertemporal tradeoff exhibit less discounting. Agents who are unable to think carefully
about an intertemporal tradeoff – e.g., due to cognitive load – exhibit more discounting. In our
framework, patience is highly unstable, fluctuating with the accuracy of forecasting.

Introduction

Most people appear to act as if they have a strong preference for earlier rewards over later
rewards. For the last century economists have usually assumed that this type of behavior
re‡ects (fundamental) time preferences, which economists model with discount factors that
multiplicatively weight utils. If the one-period-ahead discount factor is , then
rienced now are as valuable as one util experienced next period. If

utils expe-

< 1; economic agents

prefer a current util to a delayed util.
However, such time preferences are only one of many ways to explain the empirical
regularity that intertemporal choices are characterized by declining sensitivity as utils are
moved further away in time. Diminishing sensitivity to future utils is also explained by
imperfect information. For example, Böhm-Bawerk (1889) wrote that “we possess inadequate
power to imagine and to abstract, or that we are not willing to put forth the necessary e¤ort,
but in any event we limn a more or less incomplete picture of our future wants and especially
of the remotely distant ones. And then, there are all of those wants that never come to mind
at all.” Pigou (1920) similarly observed “that our telescopic faculty is defective, and that
we, therefore, see future pleasures, as it were, on a diminished scale. That this is the right
explanation is proved by the fact that exactly the same diminution is experienced when,
apart from our tendency to forget ungratifying incidents, we contemplate the past.”1 Pigou
believed that our imperfect ability to forecast the future mirrors our imperfect ability to
recall the past.
To gain intuition for the role of imperfect forecasting, consider a driver who sees an
upcoming pothole and estimates that it is small. A few moments later, he realizes that the
pothole is large, swerves to avoid it, and crashes.

This accident is likely a re‡ection of

imperfect foresight, not procrastination or laziness. In this case, large delayed consequences
are misperceived by an imperfectly farsighted driver. We probably wouldn’t infer that the
driver didn’t care about the impending crash because it was in the “future.”If the driver had
foreseen the consequences, he would have braked earlier. In general, people will not respond
optimally to future consequences that they do not anticipate (or only partially anticipate).
Likewise, consider a sailor who sees a few clouds forming on the horizon and doesn’t
immediately take the costly action of charting a new course. When her vessel is lashed by

a violent storm the next day, it is not clear whether she was lazy the previous night, or just
mistaken in her forecast about the upcoming weather.
Decision-making is rife with situations in which a current action/inaction causes a stream
of current and future consequences, many of which are hard to foresee. If delayed consequences are typically harder to foresee than immediate consequences, then decision-makers
will appear to be impatient.
The role of imperfect information is also apparent in the seemingly impatient behavior
of non-human animals. When monkeys are given an abstract intertemporal choice task on
a computer, they act as if they discount delayed rewards at the rate of 10% per second.
When the same monkeys are given a temporally analogous foraging task (also presented
on a computer screen), the monkeys show very little discounting (Blanchard and Hayden
2015). Animal behavior appears to be impatient in completely novel domains and patient
in domains that are evolutionarily relevant. As Blanchard and Hayden (2015) conclude,
“Seemingly impulsive behavior in animals is an artifact of their di¢ culty understanding the
structure of intertemporal choice tasks.”
In the current paper, we argue that behavior that arises from imperfect foresight is hard
to distinguish from behavior that arises from time preferences. We study a Bayesian decisionmaker with perfectly patient time preferences who receives noisy signals about the future.
The resulting signal-extraction problem leads the Bayesian agent to behave in a way that
is easy to misinterpret as a time preference; we call this seemingly impatient behavior as-if
discounting. Our analysis shows that lack of foresight generates behavior that has most of
the same characteristics of behavior that arises from deep time preferences. In other words,
a perfectly patient Bayesian decision-maker who receives noisy signals about the future will
behave as if they have time preferences.
Opthalmic myopia arises when people can’t clearly see distant objects.

But myopia

also means a “lack of foresight or discernment.”2 Such forecasting limitations matter when
agents need to judge the value of events that will occur at a temporal distance.

In this

paper, we show that imperfect foresight – i.e., myopia – generates as-if discounting, even
when the actors’ true preferences are perfectly patient.

More generally, we show that

imperfect foresight makes agents appear to behave more impatiently than implied by their
deep time preferences.

Our formal model assumes that agents receive noisy, unbiased signals about future events
and combine these signals with their priors to generate posterior beliefs about future events.
Our key assumption is that the forecasting noise increases with the horizon of the forecast.
We give special attention to the case in which the variance of the forecasting noise rises
linearly with the forecasting horizon.
We provide an illustrative example of our framework in Section 2, where we study a
binary choice problem: an actor chooses between an early reward and a mutually exclusive
later reward. We show that when the variance of forecasting noise rises linearly with the
event horizon, Bayesian agents will act as if they are hyperbolic discounters, even though
their deep time preferences are perfectly patient.
In Section 3, we describe the broader implications of our framework, and identify predictions that distinguish our framework from time preference models. First, we show that our
(perfectly patient) agents exhibit preference reversals of the same kind that are exhibited
by agents with hyperbolic discount functions. However, these preference reversals do not
re‡ect a self-control problem. The preference reversals arise because the agents obtain less
noisy information with the passage of time. Accordingly, our agents do not wish to commit
themselves; they act as-if they are naive hyperbolic discounters (Strotz 1957, Akerlof 1992,
O’Donoghue and Rabin 1999) rather than sophisticated ones (Laibson 1997).
In the cross-section, our framework implies that agents with greater intelligence exhibit
less as-if discounting –their superior forecasting ability enables them to make choices that
are more responsive to future utility ‡ows.
In addition, our agents exhibit as-if discounting that is domain speci…c. They exhibit
less as-if discounting (i) when they have more overall life experience, (ii) when they are more
experienced in the speci…c choice domain, (iii) when they have more time to think about an
intertemporal choice (e.g., Imas, Khun, and Mironova, 2016), and (iv) when they have more
cognitive bandwidth to think about their choice (e.g., Benjamin and Shapiro, 2015).
In Section 4, we generalize our example by making the action set continuous. We provide
su¢ cient conditions that imply that perfectly patient agents who are imperfect forecasters
will act as if they are naive hyperbolic discounters.
In Section 5, we discuss connections between our framework and related literatures on
myopia, Bayesian cognition, risk, and discounting. Section 6 concludes.

A Basic Case: Binary Choice

Our approach can be explained with a simple example of a binary choice.

Consider an

agent at time zero, who must choose (irreversibly) between two mutually exclusive rewards:
Early and Late. Reward Early would be experienced at date, t
be experienced at date, t +

> t (i.e.,

0: Reward Late would

> 0): The agent doesn’t know the true value of

Early and Late, respectively denoted, ut and ut+ : To simplify exposition and without loss of
generality, we assume that these utility events are deterministic, though they were originally
generated from a prior distribution that we will characterize below. (Note that any nondeterministic, zero-mean component is irrelevant because we are operating in utility space
and we assume that our agents have classical expected utility preferences.)
Although the agent doesn’t know the value of ut and ut+ ; the agent can mentally simulate
these deterministic rewards and thereby generate unbiased signals of their value:
st = ut + "t
st+ = ut+ + "t+ :
In the …rst equation, ut is the true value of the Early utils and "t is the simulation noise.
In the second equation, ut+ is the true value of the Late utils and "t+ is the associated
simulation noise. For tractability, we assume that the simulation noise is Gaussian. To
simplify exposition, we assume that the correlation between "t and "t+ is zero.

2.1

Simulation Noise

We assume that the longer the horizon, the greater the variance of the simulation noise.
Intuitively, the further away the event, the harder it is to accurately simulate the event’s
utility. Because our set-up assumes that t < t + ; this assumption implies that
var("t ) < var("t+ ):
We will also sometimes assume that
lim var("t ) = 1;

t!1

5

(1)

however this property is not important for our qualitative results.
We will pay particular attention to the special case of simulation noise that has a variance
that is proportional to the simulation horizon:
var("t ) =
var("t+ ) =

2
"t

"t

=

2
"t+

=

(3)

(t + ) :

This linearity assumption engenders a speci…c (hyperbolic) functional form in the analysis
that follows. But this linearity assumption is not necessary for our qualitative results. We
provide a complete characterization of noise functions below: i.e., necessary and su¢ cient
=conditions for the noise function to generate as-if discounting with declining discount rates
as the horizon increases. The case of linear variance is a special case in this larger class of
noise functions.

2.2

Bayesian Priors and Posteriors

The agents in our model combine Bayesian priors with their signals (st and st+ ) to generate
a Bayesian posterior. We model the Bayesian prior over utility events (in whatever class of
events we are studying) as a Gaussian density with mean

is the average value in this class of utility events (e.g., visits to Philadelphia), whereas

is the overall variance within the class (e.g., some trips are great –Philadelphia in June

–and some trips are much less great –Philadelphia in January).
In the appendix, we derive the agent’s Bayesian posterior distribution of ut , which is
generated by combining her prior (4) and her signal st :

For reasons that will become apparent below, we refer to D(t) as the agent’s as-if discount

function. Because we assume that simulation noise,

is increasing in t; D(t) is decreasing

in t; which is a standard property of a discount function. If limt!1 var("t ) = 1; then
limt!1 D(t) = 0, another common property of a discount function. In this case, the posterior
expectation of ut converges to the mean of the prior as the horizon increases. In notation,
lim E0 [ut j st ] = :

t!1

It is helpful to integrate posteriors over agents in the economy.

We assume that the

signals st are unbiased, so they are equal to ut on average. Accordingly, the average forecast
of ut will be

Z

st

E0 [ut j st ] dF (st j ut ) =

+ D(t)(ut

):

In general, the mean of the prior will be less extreme than the actual values of ut : To model
this statistical property, consider the illustrative case in which the prior is approximately
equal to zero. (We will relax this restriction later.) Under this restriction, the average belief
is

Z

st

E0 [ut j st ] dF (st j ut ) = D(t)ut :

We now have an expression that looks like a discounted utility framework: D(t) is a decreasing
function and it multiplies the actual utility value ut :

We explore a benchmark case: noise that is linear in the horizon.

At horizon 0, the as-if discount rate is : The as-if discount rate falls with t: As t ! 1, the
as-if discount rate converges to 0.

2.4

An Example When the Mean Priori Is not Zero ( 6= 0)

As we noted above, actual utility events will tend to be more extreme than priors.

To

capture this property, we previously set the mean of the prior distribution equal to zero:
= 0: We now relax this restriction and illustrate the general case with an example in
which the mean of the prior distribution is

= 1: For this example, we assume that the

simulation variance is linear in the time horizon and the variance ratio is

prior distribution …xed at

ut =

10 =

9:

When the three utility events are in the present (t = 0), the three expectations are equal
to the true value of each utility event, respectively 11, 1/2, and -9. However, as the three
utility events recede into the distant future, the three expectations revert to the mean of the
prior,

= 1: This discounting towards the mean of the prior is hyperbolic because we are

assuming linear variance (see subsection 2.3).
The ut = 11 curve is characterized by standard discounting.

The further ahead the

utility event is shifted, the lower the perceived value of the event. The ut =

9 curve is

also characterized by standard discounting on most of its domain. As the event is moved
further into the future, its value declines toward zero. However, at t = 90; the perceived
value crosses the x-axis and continues asymptoting toward

=

1: Finally, the ut = 1=2

line displays anti-discounting. The further the value is moved into the future, the higher its
perceived value, as it asymptotes to the prior mean of

= 1:

These three lines illustrate the three types of cases that arise in our framework, including
the special case of anti-discounting. Note that anti-discounting arises when the true value
of ut lies between 0 and the mean of the prior distribution, :

2.5

Probabilistic Choice

Our framework implies that choice is probablistic, because agents receive noisy signals about
the value of future rewards. In our example, the agent chooses Early if and only if
D(t)st

D(t + )st+ ;

9

where D(t) is the as-if discount function introduced above and st and st+ are the (unbiased)
signals of the respective values of the Early and Late rewards.
From the perspective of an observer who knows the values of ut and ut+ , the probability
that that agent chooses the Early reward is
P(choose Early) = P [D (t) (ut + "t )
1

=
where

is a Gaussian CDF and
=

[D(t)ut

D (t + ) (ut+ + "t+ )]
D(t + )ut+ ] ;

is a scaling factor:

p
D(t)2 var("t ) + D(t + )2 var("t+ ):

This probabilistic choice function has natural properties. If t = 0 (i.e., the Early reward
is an immediate reward), then,
P(choose Early) = P [u0
1

=

D ( ) (u + " )]
[u0

D( )u ] :

If we let the time delay between the Early reward and the Late reward go to in…nity (i.e.,
! 1), then
lim P(choose Early) = 1u0 >0 :
!1

This implies that the agent chooses the Early reward with probability one if three properties
hold: (i) the Early reward is available immediately (t = 0), (ii) the Late reward is available
arbitrarily far in the future ( ! 1), and (iii) the Early reward is strictly positive (u0 > 0).
In other words, the agent behaves as if she places no value on the (in…nitely) delayed Late
reward.
Now assume that the Early reward is available with some delay, so that t > 0 (i.e., the
Early reward is not immediate), then
lim P(choose Early) = P [ut + "t > 0]
!1

=

10

ut

:

Accordingly, if the Late reward is available arbitrarily far in the future ( ! 1), then the
agent chooses the Early reward with the same probability that she perceives the Early
reward to have positive value. Once again, the agent behaves as if she places no value on
the (in…nitely) delayed Late reward.

2.6

Preference Reversals without Commitment

In our setting, an observer who knows the values of ut and ut+ will be able to predict
(probabilistic) preference reversals. For example, consider the case of linear variances. In
addition, assume that ut+ > ut > 0; and
ut > D( )ut+ :
When the two options are su¢ ciently far in the future (large t), a majority of agents (if
forced to choose) will prefer Late over Early, because
P(choose Early) =

1

[D(t)ut

D(t + )ut+ ] :

Note that
D(t)ut

D(t + )ut+ =

ut
1+ t

ut+
:
1 + (t + )

For su¢ ciently large values of t; ut+ > ut implies,
ut
1+ t

ut+
< 0:
1 + (t + )

However, with the passage of time, all agents will eventually choose Early because ut >
D( )ut+ : More precisely, if agents were not forced to choose in advance, but were instead
given the chance to choose at time t; all would choose Early.
In many economic models, such preference reversals are a sign of dynamic inconsistency
in preferences.3 That is not the case here. The agents in the current model have imperfect
information, not dynamically inconsistent time preferences.
3

Their externally predictable

See McGuire and Kable (2012, 2013) for a setting in which preference reversals arise because of rational
learning dynamics. If a delayed reward that was probabilitistically expected does not arrive after a period
of waiting, the agent infers that the hazard rate of arrival is low and further waiting is not likely to pay o¤,
and therefore reverts to choosing the immediate reward.

11

preference reversals are a result of their imperfect information. Accordingly, the agents in
our model will not desire to limit their own choice sets. Preference reversals arise from their
inference problems, not self-control problems.

2.7

More General Discounting Functions

We can provide necessary and su¢ cient conditions for the as-if discount function, D(t);
to exhibit decreasing impatience. In other words, we can derive necessary and su¢ cient
conditions for the property that the instantaneous as-if discount rate
D0 (t)
D(t)

(t) :=
is decreasing in the horizon t:

Proposition 2 The as-if discount function D(t) exhibits strictly decreasing impatience at
time horizon t if and only if

Because we assume that

proposition yields an immediate corollary.
Lemma 2 The as-if discount function D(t) exhibits strictly decreasing impatience if the
variance of simulation noise, var("t ) =

2
"t ;

is a weakly concave function of time.

Accordingly, our model generates as-if discount rates that decrease as the horizon increases in many cases. We next study a boundary case.
Exponential As-if Discounting Our framework can also be reverse-engineered to generate exponential discounting as a special case. However, this requires assumptions on the
variance function that we believe are heroic.
Lemma 3 The as-if discount function D(t) exhibits a constant discount rate, ; if and only
if

Accordingly, the discount rate is exponential if and only if the simulation variance,

rises exponentially. This Lemma is proven by setting

This sort of cognitive discounting is useful because of the tractability it induces (see for
instance Gabaix 2016a,b).

Implications

We now discuss the key predictions of our model, emphasizing several ways that our model
of myopia di¤ers from other models in the intertemporal choice literature.

As discussed

above, our myopic agent acts as if she is maximizing a utility function with an as-if discount
function, D( ), where
1

D( ) =

1+

2
"
2
u

:

When the variance of the forecasting noise is weakly concave in the simulation horizon, the
discounting function is characterized by an instantaneous discount rate that falls with the
horizon. When the forecasting noise is linear in the simulation horizon, so that

2
"

=

2
"

then the discount function is hyperbolic:
D( ) =

1
1+

2
"
2
u

:

These as-if discounting functions arise because of the imperfect information that the agent
has when she generates forecasts. If she were asked to describe her preferences, she would
say that she has no times preferences. In other words, she is trying to maximize
TPt

u(at+ ):

=0

Her as-if discounting behavior arises because she doesn’t have perfect foresight regarding the
future utility ‡ows u(at+ ):

13

3.1

Absence of Commitment

The agents in this model have a forecasting problem, not a self-control problem. Therefore
they are never willing to reduce their choice set (unless they are paid to do so). This absence
of a willingness to pay for commitment may explain the lack of commitment technologies in
markets. In real markets there is little commitment for commitment’s sake.4 Personal trainers and website blocking apps are frequently mentioned exceptions, but such technologies
are not commonly used.
By contrast, economists have been able to elicit commitment in experiments (see Cohen,
Ericson, Laibson, and White 2017, for a review). However, most of these experiments elicit
only a weak taste for a commitment and little or no willingness to pay for commitment (e.g.,
Augenblick, Niederle and Sprenger 2015, Sado¤, Samek and Sprenger 2016).
Our myopia model predicts that agents will exhibit as-if hyperbolic discounting with
preference reversals and no willingness to pay for commitment.

In this sense, our model

reproduces the predictions of the standard hyperbolic discounting model with naive beliefs
(see O’Donoghue and Rabin 1999, 2001, Laibson 2015, and Ericson forthcoming). However,
it also generate further implications, to which we now turn.

3.2

Intelligence Is Associated with Less As-if Discounting

Our model predicts that agents with less forecasting noise will exhibit less as-if discounting.
Because of this mechanism, agents that are more intelligent will exhibit less as-if discounting.5
To see this formally, let H represent human capital and assume that the variance of
forecasting noise is declining in human capital:
d "2 (H)
< 0:
dH
The as-if discount rate is given by
D0 (t)
=
;
D(t)
1+ t
4

However, there is a great deal of ancillary commitment, like mortgage contracts, which create a forced
savings system as a by-product of a stream of loan/principal repayments.
5
The underlying assumption is that more intelligent agents simulate the future with less noise— for instance because they generate more simulations. If they run n simulations, the variance of the average
simulation will be 1=n, so it will be lower.

where

The as-if discount rate is increasing in

" (H);

so as-if discounting is decreasing in human

capital, H:
The available evidence supports this prediction. Measured discount rates are negatively
correlated with scores on IQ tests: see Benjamin, Brown, and Shapiro (2013), Burk et al.
(2009) and Shamosh and Gray (2008). Indeed, such e¤ects also arise across species. Tobin
and Logue (1994) show that patience increases as the study population switches from pigeons,
to rats, to humans.

3.3

Myopia Is Domain Speci…c

These comparative statics on cognitive function generate a wider set of predictions when
forecasting ability varies across domains. For example, our framework predicts that agents
with more domain-relevant experience, and hence better within-domain forecasting ability,
will exhibit less discounting. Read, Frederick and Scholten (2013) report that people exhibit
more patience when an intertemporal choice is posed as an investment rather than a (seemingly novel) money-now-vs-money-later decision. Relatedly, recall our earlier discussion of
the monkey experiments reported by Blanchard and Hayden (2015): when an intertemporal
choice is presented as a reward-now-vs-reward-later decision, monkeys choose far more impatiently then they do when a foraging problem is used to frame the intertemporal tradeo¤s.
Likewise, our framework predicts that older agents –who generally have more life experience and consequently better forecasting skills –will exhibit less discounting. This prediction
is supported by Green, Fry, and Myerson (1994). Relatedly, Addessi et al (2014) show that
replacing one-for-one representations of future reward with more abstract one-for-many representations of the same future rewards, leads capuchin monkeys and (human) children to
exhibit more impatience. In contrast, adults, who have more experience using abstract symbols, do not behave more impatiently when one-for-one representations of future reward are
replaced with one-for-many representations. The Addessi et al (2014) experimental evidence
implies that childhood impatience is due, at least in part, to children’s less developed ability
to cognitively represent (abstract) future rewards. Our framework also predicts that people
who experience cognitive decline (e.g., due to normal aging) will exhibit more discounting;

Our framework predicts that agents who are encouraged to spend more time thinking
about a future tradeo¤ will exhibit less discounting.

Imas, Kuhn, and Mironova (2016)

robustly measure such an e¤ect experimentally. In their experiment, some subjects decide
at time 0 how to divide an e¤ort task between time 0 and time t: Other subjects are given a
preceding hour to decide how to divide the e¤ort task between time 0 and time t: Subjects
in the latter condition choose more patiently: their measured discount rate is 16 percentage
points lower.
Our framework also predicts that rewards delivered in future periods that are cognitively
well-simulated will exhibit less discounting. Peters and Büchel (2010) exogenously manipulate the salience of various future periods and …nd that higher salience/imagery of future
reward periods increases the value of rewards delivered during those periods.
Our framework predicts that agents who are unable to think carefully about an intertemporal tradeo¤ – e.g., due to a cognitive load manipulation or the e¤ects of alcohol – will
exhibit more discounting. Steele and Josephs (1990), Shiv and Fedorikhin (1999), Hinson,
Jameson, and Whitney (2003), and Benjamin, Brown and Shapiro (2013) document such
e¤ects.

This prediction is closely related to the theory of cognitive scarcity: see Spears

(2012), Eldar and Sha…r (2013), and Schilbach et al (2016).
Finally, our framework predicts that discounting behavior will only be weakly correlated
across domains because discounting is not a domain general preference, but rather the result
of imperfect forecasting, which will naturally vary across domains. Chapman (1996) and
Chabris et al (2008) document the low level of correlation in discount rates that are measured
in di¤erent decision-making domains.

Extension to a Continuous Action

Until now we have studied the case in which the agent has two mutually exclusive actions:
choose an Early reward or a Late reward. We now generalize the action space to a continuum. We then provide su¢ cient conditions that enable us to apply our framework to a
general, multi-period intertemporal choice problem.
The upshot of this section is that the economics of the binary action case still goes
through, though with more complex mathematics.

4.1

Modelling How Agents Observe with Noise a Whole Utility
Function

Suppose that an action a leads to a true payo¤ u (a). However, the agent observes this
noisily: we suppose that the agent observes the “noised up”version of the utility function:
(9)

s = (s (a))a2A

of the whole function u = (u (a))a2A , where A = [a; a] is the support of the action, which is
assumed to contain 0 (this is just a normalization). This noised-up version is assumed to
take the form:
s (a) = u (a) +

"t W

(a) +

(10)

"t 0

for all a 2 A. There is a continuous noise W (a), modelled as standard Brownian motion
with W (0) = 0 except that W is “two-sided”, i.e. runs to the left and right of 0.6;7 The noise
is modelled as proportional to "t when the utility is seen from a distance t. For instance, the
p
linear case is "t = " t: The term "t 0 ensures that the value at a = 0 is also perceived
with noise (

0

= 1,

is a parameter).

Given this perceived curve s, what’s his posterior about u (a)? We will see the under the
“right”assumptions (to be speci…ed soon), we simply have
E [u (a) j s] = D (t) s (a)
with the same D (t) as in the binary case. This means that the representative agent just
dampens the true function.

4.2

Assumptions for Our Result

Here we detail the assumptions we use for the results. But the reader may wish to skip to
the result itself, in the next subsection 4.3.
Assumption 1 (Wiener decomposition) We suppose that function v ( ) :=
6

u( ) u(0)
u

is per-

Formally, W (x)x 0 and W ( x)x 0 are independent Brownian motions.
See Callender and Hummel (2014) for a recent model using inference on Brownian paths, though with a
signal structure di¤erent from ours.

pendent of v. We call
1

D (t) =

where

"t

is as in (10).

Let us state this assumption in more user-friendly language. The value of u (0) is also
seen as random— and we index its randomness by

. The rest of the function u, outside

the intercept, is also random. To specify this, we v (a) :=

u(a) u(0)
u

, which is u normalized

to have 0 intercept, and with standardized size (so E v (1)2 = 1). We view v a a “random
function” drawn from a distribution. For simplicity, we consider that it’s drawn from the
simplest distribution of random functions –the so-called Wiener measure (Brownian motions
are typical instances of such functions).8 Basically, the assumption is that the component
of du (a) are drawn as i.i.d. normal increments, like a Brownian motion, with square width
2
u da.

Note that this refers to the distribution assumed by the agent when he performs his

Bayesian inference, not necessarily the true distribution.
The appendix (section 7.2) proposes a variant, Assumption 2, with polynomial utility,
that uses more elementary mathematics, at the cost of heavier notations and proofs.

4.3

Perceived Utility Function Given the True Utility

We can now derive the utility perceived by the agent, given she agent sees the whole noised-up
function s (equation (10)).
Proposition 3 (Perceived utility for a continuous utility function) Make Assumption 1 or
2. Then, the perceived utility is proportional to the signal:
E [u (a) j s] = D (t) s (a)
where D (t) =

1
1+

2
"t
2
u

. As a result, the average perceived utility u (a), de…ned as:

u (a) := E [E [u (a) j s] j u]
8

We could imagine a number of variants, e.g. u00 would be drawn from this distribution; or, to keep u
concave, we could have ln ( u00 ) drawn from that distribution. This becomes quickly more mathematically
involved, so we leave this to a separate investigation, and focus on what we view as the simplest case.

18

satis…es:
u (a) = D (t) u (a)

(12)

This means that the average perceived utility is D (t) u (a) rather than plainly u (a),
exactly like in the simple two-action (consume / don’t consume) case.

4.4

The Representative Agent Perspective

4.4.1

Assumptions for a Tractable Generalization

To cleanly study dynamic problem, we assume the following (in addition to the assumptions
of Proposition 3).9
A1. The agent treats the noise at all simulation horizons as uncorrelated.
A2. The agent has Gaussian priors with 0 mean (and no correlation between ut ; ut+ ).
A3. The agent acts as if she won’t learn new simulation information in the future.10
The notion of “average behavior” is potentially messy with non-linear utilities. Hence,
we …nd it useful to de…ne the following form of “representative agent”version of the model.
We study the equilibrium path in which all simulation noise happens to be realized as zero
(but the agent doesn’t know this). In our illustrative example, this corresponds to "t = 0.
For instance, we had st = ut + "t and E[ut j st ] = D(t)st . The representative agent draws
noise "t = 0; so for the representative agent, E[ut j st ] = D (t) ut .
Proposition 4 (Dynamic choices of the representative agent) Assume that the agent has
dynamically consistent preferences

Then A1-A3 imply that at each time period t 2 f0; :::; T g the representative agent acts as if

There are many alternative ways to generate variances that are linear in the forecasting horizon, including
new signals that contain all of the information of the old signals.
10
This is the assumption of the “anticipated utility” framework of Kreps (1998) used also by Cogley and
Sargent (2008).

Literatures on Related Mechanisms

We now review other lines of research that are related to this paper and on which this paper
builds. We review three literatures: models of myopia, Bayesian foundations of imperfect
and costly cognition, risk-based models of as-if discounting (including risk-based models with
probability distortions).

5.1

Myopia

Political economists, psychologists, and other social scientists have long posited that impatient behavior was due in part to imperfect foresight. These ideas were informally described
by political economists, including Böhm-Bawerk (1889), and economists, including Pigou
(1921), both of whom are quoted in the introduction of this paper.
These informal explanations have been joined by formal, mathematical de…nitions, models, and analyses of that incorporate various formulations of myopia. For example, Brown
and Lewis (1981) provide an axiomatic de…nition of myopia. Feldstein (1985) evaluates the
optimality of social security under the assumptions of myopia and partial myopia (modeled
20

as a low discount factor in a two-period decision problem). Phillippe Jéhiel (1995) studies
two-player games in which players have limited forecasting horizons. Spears (2012) generate a forecasting horizon that is endogenous because forward-looking calculations are costly.
Gabaix, Laibson, Moloche, and Weinberg (2006) report experimental evidence that supports
a model in which agents choose an endogenous forecasting horizon at which the cognitive cost
and estimated utility bene…t of marginally increasing the forecasting horizon are equalized.
This optimal forecasting framework generates a complex option value problem with respect
to information acquisition (see also Fudenberg, Strack, and Strzalecki 2016).
In the current paper, we assume that the agent has noisy signals about the future, which
engenders Bayesian forecasts that have “myopic” properties: i.e., declining sensitivity to
future events. When the noise is linear in the forecasting horizon, the as-if discounting takes
a simple hyperbolic form. Accordingly, our paper introduces a tractable microfoundation
for myopia.

5.2

Bayesian Models of Attention and Cognition

The current paper assumes that agents are Bayesian, which adopts the approach of early
decision-theory pioneers like Rai¤a and Schlaifer (1961). There is a growing body of literature (in economics, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience) that studies the e¤ects of noisy
perception and Bayesian inference, and uses this combination to explain seemingly suboptimal behaviors. One of the pioneering examples is the work of Commons, Woodford and
Ducheny (1982), and Commons, Woodford and Trudeau (1991) who use this approach to
generate a theory of hyperbolic memory recall – in their framework, the noisy signals are
memories, whereas the noisy signals in our model are simulations of the future. The literature
on attention allocation assumes that agents have limited information, which is mathematically equivalent to the assumption that agents have noisy signals about the state of the
world. Geanakoplos and Milgrom (1991), Sims (2003), Kamenica (2008), Woodford (2009),
Gabaix (2014), Schwartzstein (2014), Hanna, Mullainathan and Schwartzstein (2014), Allcott and Taubinsky (2015), Matejka, Steiner and Stewart (forth.), Taubinsky and Rees-Jones
(2016a,b), study agents who allocate their limited attentional bandwidth to the activities
that they believe are the most valuable.11 Steiner and Stewart (2016) and Khaw, Li, and
11

Another strand of the literature uses non-Bayesian rules to govern attention and salience (e.g. Bordalo,
Gennaioli and Shleifer 2012, 2013), though it might be probably be given some quasi-Bayesian interpretation.

21

Woodford (2017) study an environment in which agents react to the noise in their probability
perceptions by (optimally) distorting their perceived probabilities in a way that mimics the
probability mapping in prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979).
Our paper adopts the approach that uni…es the work above: noisy signals plus Bayesian
inference jointly produce as-if behavior that appears to be imperfectly rational. Speci…cally,
in our case, this combination generates as-if hyperbolic discounting.

5.3

Risk-Based Models of As-if Discounting

It has long been recognized that time preferences engender the same kind of behavior that is
associated with risk or mortality (e.g., Yaari 1965). For example, if promised future rewards
may be permanently withdrawn/lost at a constant hazard rate, ; then a perfectly patient
decision-maker should be indi¤erent between 1 util at time zero and exp(

) utils a time .

In this example, risk induces a perfectly patient agent to appear to discount the future with
exponential discount rate :
This type of risk-based discounting can also produce hyperboloid discount functions under speci…c assumptions about a non-constant hazard rate (see Sozou 1998, Azfar 1999,
Weitzman 2001, Halevy 2004, and Dasgupta and Maskin 2005). For instance, Azfar, Sozou
and Weitzman assume that the hazard rate that governs the withdrawal of rewards is itself
drawn from a distribution and has a value that can only be inferred from the observed data.
This assumption produces preferences that are characterized by a declining discount rate as
the horizon increases –the more time passes without a withdrawal, the more likely that one
of the low hazard rates is the hazard rate that was drawn from the distribution at the start
of time, implying a lower e¤ective discount rate at longer horizons. Risk can also produce
hyperboloid discount functions because of probability transformations that are characterized
by a certainty e¤ect, whereby a certain present reward is discretely more valuable than an
even slightly uncertain delayed reward (see the non-expected utility frameworks in Prelec
and Loewenstein 1991, Quiggin and Horowitz 1995, Keren and Roelofsma 1995, Weber and
Chapman 2005, Halevy 2008, Epper, Fehr-Duda and Bruhin 2011, Baucells and Heukamp
2012, Andreoni and Sprenger 2012, and Fehr-Duda and Epper 2015).
Our model works o¤ a related but di¤erent risk mechanism than those listed above. The
uncertainty in our model is due to noise that is generated by the forecaster herself.

22

For

example, our mechanism predicts that an expert would exhibit little as-if discounting in
her domain of expertise (she forecasts the future with little or no noise) while a non-expert
would exhibit substantial as-if discounting in the same domain (she forecasts the future
with relatively more noise than the expert). Likewise, our framework predicts that cognitive
load should increase as-if discounting because it reduces an agent’s ability to forecast accurately. Accordingly, our noise-based discounting mechanism is not propagated by external
risk (like mortality or the likelihood of default), but rather by noise associated with the
limited forecasting ability of the decision maker.
Finally, our framework is consistent with Bayesian decision-making and expected utility
theory.

Accordingly, our agent will not be dynamically inconsistent and will not pay for

commitment. In our framework, preference reversals re‡ect classical information acquisition,
not weakness of will.
Our key assumption is that the agent has (unbiased) noise in her signals about the
future. This noise leads our agent to optimally down-weight her simulations of the future
and therefore place more weight on her priors. Consequently, she ends up being (rationally)
imperfectly responsive to future contingencies and therefore behaves as if she discounts the
future. As her expertise and experience improves (over her lifetime, or as she gains domainspeci…c knowledge), she shifts her behavior and acts as-if she has become more patient.

6

Conclusion

We assume that perfectly patient agents estimate the value of future events by generating
noisy, unbiased simulations of those events. Our agents combine these noisy signals with
their priors, thereby forming posterior utility expectations. We show that these expectations
exhibit a property that we call as-if discounting. Speci…cally, the agent makes choices as if
she were maximizing a stream of known utils weighted by an as-if discount function, D(t):
This as-if discount function adjusts for the fact that future utils are not actually known by
the agent and must be estimated with noisy signals and priors.

This estimation shades

the estimated utils toward the mean of the prior distribution, creating behavior that largely
mimics the e¤ect of classical time preferences.
When the simulation noise has a variance that is linear in the event’s horizon, the as-if

23

discount function is hyperbolic:
D(t) =
where

1
;
1+ t

is the ratio of the variance of (per-period) simulation noise to the variance of events

in the agent’s prior distribution.
Our model generates several predictions that match the known empirical evidence. Our
agents exhibit systematic preference reversals. Our agents have no intrinsic taste for commitment, because they su¤er from an imperfect forecasting problem, not a self-control problem. Our agents will exhibit comparative statics with respect to cognitive function: people
who are more skilled at forecasting (e.g., those with greater intelligence) will exhibit less
discounting.
Our framework predicts many domain-speci…c discounting e¤ects.
domain-relevant experience will exhibit less discounting.

Agents with more

Older agents will exhibit less

discounting (except those with cognitive decline, who will exhibit more discounting). Agents
who are encouraged to spend more time thinking about a future tradeo¤ will exhibit less
discounting.

Finally, agents who are unable to think carefully about an intertemporal

tradeo¤ –e.g., due to a cognitive load manipulation –will exhibit more discounting.
Our framework predicts that discounting is a highly variable/plastic phenomenon that
arises from imperfect forecasting of future rewards/costs. Our model provides a complementary alternative to the classical assumption that discounting arises from a deep preference
for known rewards (costs) to be moved earlier (later) in time.

Appendix: Proofs and Complements

7.1

Omitted Proofs

Proof of Proposition 1 This proof is very elementary, but for completeness we provide
its calculations. We normalize
u0t = ut

and s0t = st

= 0 without loss of generality (for instance, by considering

). It is well-known that ut j st is Gaussian distributed, and can

be represented:
ut = st +
for some , and some Gaussian variable

t

(13)

t

independent of st , so that E [st t ] = 0. Multiplying

(13) by st on both sides and taking the expectations gives: E [ut st ] = E [s2t ], i.e.
E [ut st ]
E [ut (ut + "t )]
E [u2t ]
=
=
as E [ut "t ] = 0
E [s2t ]
E [u2t + "2t ]
E (ut + "t )2
2
1
= 2 u 2 =
= D (t) .
2
u + "t
1 + "2t

=

u

Next, taking the variance of both sides of (13), we have

u

u

var( t ) =

as cov (st ; t ) = 0 and with

Hence, ut j st

as announced.

Proof of Proposition 3 It is a corollary of Proposition 5 (for Assumption 1) and
Proposition 6 (for Assumption 2) below.

where s = (st (y) ; :::; st+ (y))y2A . Assumption A1-A3 allows us to remove expected values.
For our representative agent, we have st+ (a) = ut+ (a). Hence, this representative agent
maximizes at time t:

Complements to the Continuous Actions Case

Here are some complements to Section 4. To simplify the notations, we set

Result for the Wiener case

Proposition 5 (Bayesian updating with functions) Under Assumption 1, we have
E [u (a) j s] = s (a)
with

=

1
1+

2
2
"t = u

. This means that we can do Bayesian updating on this space of functions.

Proof. Take the increments:
ds (a) = du (a) + dW (a)
The key observation is that the ds (a)’s are all Gaussians innovations, independent of the
value of the functions are other points y 6= a. So, by the formulation for Gaussian updating
we used before:
E [du (a) j ds (a)] = ds (a)
with

=

1
1+

2= 2
u

. Next, because the du (a) and dW (a) are independent,
E [du (a) j s] = E [du (a) j ds (a)] = ds (a) :

Next, the behavior at 0 needs a special treatment.
E [u (0) j s (0)] =

0 s (0),

with

var(

and by independence:

E [u (0) j s] = s (0) :

32

Because s (0) = u (0) +

(14)

(15)

Hence, integrating from 0 to a, we get
E [u (a) j s] = E u (0) +

7.2.2

Polynomial utility

Here we provide assumptions that are a little more elementary, but apply only when the
utility function u (a) is a polynomial in a. For instance, we want to capture that u (a) =
b0 + b1 a + b2 a2 with unknown coe¢ cients bi , that the agent wants to learn from noisy signals.
Assumptions for the polynomial utility case We shall use the Legendre Pi (a)
polynomials as a basis, as they are more convenient than the plain monomials ai . We have
for instance:12
P0 (a) = 1;

P1 (a) = a;

1
3a2
2

P2 (a) =

Using the product
hf j gi :=
we have the standard result: hPi j Pj i =

Z

i+ 21

1 ;

P3 (a) =

1
5a3
2

3a :

1

f (a) g (a) da;

(16)

1

1i=j . So we de…ne qi to be a rescaled version of

the standard Legendre polynomial:

qi (a) :=

r

1
i + Pi (a) ;
2

(17)

so that
hqi j qj i = 1i=j .

(18)

Polynomial qi has degree i, and the qi ’s form an orthogonal basis for polynomial functions.
We can now state our assumption.
12

More generally we have Pi (a) =

1 di
2i i! dai

by Rodrigues’formula.

Assumption 2 (Utility function as drawn from a random distribution on polynomial basis)
We decompose the true utility function u (a) as:
1

u (a) =

(19)

fi Qi (a)

i= 1

where Q

Legrendre polynomial (17). We assume that a …nite subset I such that coe¢ cients ffi gi2I
are nonzero and that the fi for i 2 I are i.i.d. and follow a N (0;

distribution. Also

2 2
u.

=

We note that, in the limit where all coe¢ cients are non-zero, we get the “Wiener”case.
Result We prove a more general proposition.
Proposition 6 Suppose that coe¢ cients fi are drawn from the Gaussian N 0; f2i , and
h
i
jointly Gaussian and uncorrelated. Then, the posterior E [u (a) j s] := E u (a) j (s (y))y2[ 1;1]
is:

E [u (a) j s] =
where, for i

posterior is:
u (a) := E [[u (a) j s] j f ] =

1
X

i fi Qi

(20)

(a) :

i= 1

In particular, take the case of ‡at priors of Assumption 2, and call

= 1= 1 +

2
2
u

.

Then,
u (a) = u (a)
i.e. we obtain uniform dampening.

34

(21)

Proof of Proposition 6 Suppose that we have a function u (a), and we observe, as in
(10),
s (a) = u (a) + W (a) +
where W (a) is a Brownian motion and ~0 =

0

(22)

0

is a Gaussian variable of mean zero.

Di¤erentiate:
ds (a) = u0 (a) da + dW (a)

u (a) =

j= 1

Hence:
ds (a) =

X

1
X

fj qj (a) :

j=0

fj qj (a) da + dW (a):

j=0

The agent wants to infer u given s, i.e. f given ds (we consider the intercept u (0) at the
end). Multiplying the previous equation by qi (a) and integrating between

1 and 1 gives:

Si := hqi j dsi
X
=
fj hqi j qj i + hqi j dW i

(23)

j

= fi + hqi j dW i
because of (18).
Hence we can write the signal Si := hqi j dsi as
(24)

Si = fi + "i
with "i := hqi j dW i =

qi (a) qj (a) da

= 1i=j :
Hence, the signal-extraction problem E [fi j s] is quite simple, as only Si is informative

about fi : E [fi j s] = E [fi j Si ]. Given (24),
E [fi j s] =

E [u (0) j s] = E [f
