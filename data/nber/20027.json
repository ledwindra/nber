    "abstract": "\n\nWhy did the failure of Lehman Brothers make the financial crisis dramatically worse?  The financial crisis was a process of a build-up of risk during the crisis prior to the Lehman failure. Market participants tried to preserve an option or exit by shortening maturities - the \"flight from maturity\".  With increasingly short maturities, lenders created the possibility of fast exit. The failure of Lehman Brothers was the tipping point of this build-up of systemic fragility.  We produce a chronology of the crisis which formalizes the dynamics of the crisis. A crisis is a dynamic process in which \"tail risk\" is endogenous.\n\n",
