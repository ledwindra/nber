    "abstract": "\n\nExperts with reputational concerns, even good ones, are averse to admitting what they don\u2019t know. This diminishes our trust in experts and, in turn, the role of science in society. We model the strategic communication of uncertainty, allowing for the salient reality that some questions are ill-posed or unanswerable. Combined with a new use of Markov sequential equilibrium, our model sheds new light on old results about the challenge of getting experts to admit uncertainty \u2013 even when it is possible to check predictive success. Moreover, we identify a novel solution: checking features of the problem itself that only good experts will infer \u2013 in particular, whether the problem is answerable \u2013 allows for equilibria where uninformed experts do say \u201cI Don\u2019t Know.\u201d\n\n",
