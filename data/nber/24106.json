    "abstract": "\n\nWe study the link between \ufb01scal austerity and Nazi electoral success. Voting data from a thousand districts and a hundred cities for four elections between 1930 and 1933 shows that areas more a\ufb00ected by austerity (spending cuts and tax increases) had relatively higher vote shares for the Nazi party. We also \ufb01nd that the localities with relatively high austerity experienced relatively high su\ufb00ering (measured by mortality rates) and these areas\u2019 electorates were more likely to vote for the Nazi party. Our \ufb01ndings are robust to a range of speci\ufb01cations including an instrumental variable strategy and a border-pair policy discontinuity design.\n\n",
