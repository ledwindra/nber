    "abstract": "\n\nIn a recent paper, Barrett (2006) reaches the conclusion that in general the answer to the question in the title is no. We show in this paper that a focus on the R&D phase in the development of breakthrough technologies changes the picture. The stability of international treaties improves and thus the possibility of realizing benefits of cooperation.\n\n",
