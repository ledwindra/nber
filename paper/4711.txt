CONVERGENCE IN THE AGE
OF MASS MIGRATION

ABSTRACT
Between 1870 and 1913, economic convergence among present OECD members (or even

a wider sample of countries) was dramatic, about as dramatic as it has been over the past centuzy

and a half. The convergence can be documented in GDP per worker-hour, GD? per capita and

in real wages. What were the souxtes of the convergence? One prime candidate is mass
migration. In the absence of quotas, this was a period of open international migration, and the
numbers who elected to move were enormous. If international migration is ever to play a role
in contributing to convergence, the pre-quota period surely should be it. This paper offers some

estimates which suggest that migration could account for very large shares of the convergence
in ODP per worker and real wages, though a much smaller share in GDP per capita. One might
conclude, therefore, that the interwar cessation of convergence could be partially explained by

the imposition of quotas and other barriers to migration. The paper concludes with caution as
it enumerates the possible offsets to the mass migration impact which our partial equilibrium
analysis ignores, and with the plea that convergence models pay more attention to open-economy
forces.

CONVERGENCE IN THE AGE OF MASS MIGRATION

Introduction
In the century before 1913 some 50 million Europeans emigrated. The vast majority,
about 46 million, left Europe for the New World and the numbers increased over time.

The Old World population rose from about 192 million in 1800 to about 423 million in
1900, so annual gross emigration rates avenged about 10 per thousand over the century,
and even higher after 1880 (Kenwood and Lougheed 1992). This 'tna.ss" emigration was
on a scale not witnessed before nor since, and it generated debate on the impact of the
migrations in sending and receiving regions, the relative power of "push" and "pull," the
distributional consequences of the migrations (who gained and who lost), and whether the

migrations should have been controlled or free (Hatton and Williamson 1994
forthcoming-a). A central premise everywhere in the debate has, of course, been that
migration improved the lot of those who moved and that real wages were higher in the
destination regions. Emigration to the labor-scarce and resource-abundant New World
offered, if you will, a vent for surplus labor in the resource-scarce Old World. The
simplest explanation for the flows has therefore always been that migrants from poor Old
World countries were chasing after higher rewards, their productivity being higher on the

margin in the New World or even in richer parts of the Old World.

—1—

Unless it was offset by other forces, mass migration must have eased global labor
market disequilibrium in the late nineteenth century; labor endowments shifted frompoor
sending to rich receiving regions thus helping erase some of the wage and labor
productivity gaps between them. The process reached its apex when migration races
surged around the turn of this century (Table 1). I The age of uncontrolled mass migration

ceased, of course, after the U.S. quotas were imposed in the 1920s, and whatever
contribution the migrations made to economic convergence must have ceased as well.

The question of convergence has long captivated theorists and empiricists, but the
aim of this paper is to show how the convergence literature must take international

migration on board if our explanations are to be sufficiently comprehensive to cover
historical experience since 1850. Closed-economy growth-convergence models axe

certainly inappropriate for any discussion of the late nineteenth century world economy,
since it was characterized by a remarkably free flow of goods, capital and people.2

Indeed, this paper documents an important contribution of mass migration to convergence
1870—1910: a very large share of the significantconvergence observed would have been

erased had migration been suppressed. The estimated contribution of the mass migration
is so large, in fact, that its impact on convergence must have been complemented (onnet)
by a variety of countervailing forces: independent disequilibrating forces of technical
change (faster in rich countries); and dependent offsetting forces of capital-accumulation
(international capital chasing after the migrants or native capital accumulation stimulated

by the presence of migrant4, of trade (migrant labor favoring the expansion of laborMigration rates M=(net fiow)/POP shown in Table 1 are derived from data in the appendix, and reflect
adjustments for unobserved return migration. It is well known that historical data from theperiod
systematically underenumeraze return migration. We cannot know how serious the errors are, but we can
apply sensitivity analysis to establish what impact suth errors might have. Isis not unreasonable to think of
underreporting in the range of 0%-30%. Specifically, if M is the net migration rate in the raw data for
inflows and outflows, we estimate the ne net migration rate to be M(l-p) where p is a return-rate
correction factor, taken to be 0.1(10%) in our "baseline" estimates. The labor force migration ratesy(lp)M correct for the relative labor content of the migrant flow relative to the population stock, y. Cumulative

scale economies).

Convergence: Theory and The Late Nineteenth Century Facts
The central questions in the convergence debate are two: first, do we observe
convergence in the world economy? second, what explains convergence or its absence?
Theory

Theoretical work is in plentiful supply and ambiguous empirical evidence has allowed the

development of models that might generate convergence or divergence. Convergence
models include the venerable first-generation contributions and their recent refinements
(Uzawa 1965; Ramsey 1928; Swan 1956; Solow 1956; Koopmans 1965; Cass 1965;

Abramovitz 1956; Mankiw, Ronier and Weil 1990). Models that allow for divergence
exploit long-run increasing returns, from learning-by-doing (following Arrow) or various

externalities, or by adding additional accumulable factor such as human capital (Arrow
1962; Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1992; Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1994 forthcoming; Lucas
1988; Lucas 1990; Romer 1926; Romer 1989). Others have refined the notion of
convergence to include local and global variants (Durlauf and Johnson 1992) .The "new"
growth theozy has also focused attention on generating endogenous growth, without

appeal to a deus a macJiMa like exogenous technological change or exogenous savings
rates to explain long-mn growth.
Empirical work has proliferated, led by the pioneering contributions from Moses

Abraniovitz (1986) and William Baumol (1986) that built on the macroeconomic data
collected by Angus Maddison (1982; 1989; 1991). Abraxnovitz related the observed
"catching up" of postwar Europe (vis-A-vis the U.S.) to a morn general principle

reminiscent of the "leader's handicap" theory of Veblen (1915) or the "advantages of
backwardness" theory of Gerschenkron (1962): namely, a country with lower
productivity may exploit the technological gap with respect to the leader, import or
imitate best practice technology and, hence, raise labor productivity and living standards.

—3—

Abramovitz found GDP per worker dispersion has generally diminished over the last

century or so (Table 2, column I), with an implied average convergence speed of about
1% per annum, with particularly rapid convergence in the post-WWU period. Although
Abraxnovitz characterized the convergence before 1913 as weak, it turns out that the

speed of convergence then was very close to the long-run average. The interwar evidence
seemed to suggest lost opportunities for catching up arising from autarkic tendencies in
the world economy that obstructed capital, labor and technology flows.3
Abramovitz (1986) anticipated many refinements contained in the subsequent
literature. He noted further the distinction to be drawn between the convergence
hypothesis and the catch-up hypothesis: economic growth may depend on other factors
besides technologically driven catch up, for example, physical or human capital
deepening (Mankiw, Romer and Weil 1990; Dowrick and Nguyen 1989). Furthermore,
catch-up would be "sclf-limiting"-—declining to zero as the pmductivity gap diminished.4

Abramovicz also cited "trade and its rivalries" (including international factor flows) as

important ingredients in the convergence process, although he did notpursue the subject
in depth. Abramovitz contrasted convergence as measured by dispersion levels—now

termed "a-convergence"_wjth convergence measured by the extentto which poor
countries grow faster than rich ones, as given by a Baumol-style (partial) correlation of
growth rates and initial per capita income or productivity, now termed '3-convergence"
(Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1992). He also noted many of the statistical problems later to

plague convergence analysis, such as sample-selection bias (a tendency to falsely accept
The convergence speed is measured by the rate of decline of log (a/ps). where a Is the standard deviation

Maddison's database) and the errors-in-variables problem (a tendency for a growth race

versus initial income regression to generate false acceptance if them is measurement error
in the historical data, a problem avoided in Abramovitz's non-parametric tests). Such
problems were cause for criticism of Baumol's exploratory econometric analysis (Dc
Long 1988).

More recent empirical contributions have explored another data source in search
of convergence, the post-WWU International Comparisons Project (ICP) data gathered in
the series of Penn World Table (PWT) publications (Summers and Heston 1991).

Dowrick and Nguyen (1989) formalized Abramovitz's catch-up in a carefully specified
econometric model applied to the OECD for 1960—85, and applied to broader data for

PWT samples that included poor as well as rich countries. The authors concluded that
strong catch-up forces were at work everywhere, both in the OECD and elsewhere. Still,

"conditional" controls were important poor countries would have exhibited convergence
had not catching up been offset by high population growth and low investment rates.

Mankiw, Romer and Well (1990) offered a different interpretation of similar results,
however. Their Solovian model was augmented to include human capital accumulation
and it led them to estimate equations almost identical to those of Dowrick and Nguyen,

with a proxy for human capital investment rates (the enrollment rate) as an added

explanator. Here the initial productivity term was also found to be significa but in this
context was interpreted not as technological catching up, but as an adjustment speed in
the model's transitional dynamics. Still, the basic Dowrick-Nguyen finding on
convergence was affirmed: on the one hand, Baumol and others had suggested the
convergence club was "exclusive," based on a low correlation between growth and initial

income in raw data that included less developed countries (weak "unconditional
convergence"); however, when controls were included strong convergence was apparent
in the partial correlation of growth and initial income (strong "conditional convergence").

The Late Nineteenth Centur, Facts

We have touched on convergence theory—what about fact? Tables 2 and 3 show

exactly
what it is we wish to explain. There we offer four measures of a-convergence across the
late nineteenth century. The last column is based on a 17-country sample that includes the

twelve cuntnt European OECD countries listed in Table 3 plus three New World
members, Australia, Canada and the USA, and two New World non-members, Argentina
and Brazil. The first three columns exclude Ireland. The rate of convergence 1870-1913
in the first column was about 1% per annum, roughly equal to the long-run convergence
race over the past century or so. The degree of convergence depends greatly, however, on
the measure used and on the purchasing-power parity (PPP) comparison adopted. All
three newer estimates in columns 2 through 4 record lower rates of convergence 18701913. Note also the extent to which late 19th century convergence is diminished by the

switch from Maddison's 1982 data set (Table 2, column 1, the same data used by
Abramovicz) to Maddison's 1991 data set (Table 2, column 2). The sensitivity stems from
the estimation methodology: using individual country growth rates, Maddison projects

backwards from the l970s or 1980s GDP benchmarks constructed from PPP
comparisons, an approach that, of course, invites concern about long-run index-number
problems and doubts about the accuracy of the implicit back-projected PPPs assumed to
be stable over the past century and even longer. Thus, the availability of a new data set
based on real wages, and using additional PPP benchmarks from the 1920s and 1900-13,

provides a welcome consistency check on Maddison's aggregates (Williamson 1994
forthcoming). In short, our study uses three measures of convergence performance:

Maddison's newest GDP per capita data, Maddison's newest GDP per worker data and
Williamson's real wage data.

Migration and Convergence in Partial Equilibrium
Although technological catching up may well have been operative in the late nineteenth

century, we identify instead another powerful convergence force. The paper takes

—6—

seriously the possibility that "trade and its rivalries" mattered for late-nineteenth century
convergence, a possibility already supported by other work on the Atlantic economy

(O'Rourke and Williamson 1992; O'Rourke. Taylor and Williamson 1993). In particular,
it takes seriously the possibility that significant migration flows can generate significant

convergence (Hamilton and Whalley 1984; Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1992; Barro and
Sala-i-Martin 1994). If such is true generally, then it certainly ought to hold for the late
nineteenth century when mass migrations reached a crescendo.

Did migration lower wages in receiving countries while raising them in the
sending countries?5 The debate is at least as old as the industrial revolution, appearing
first in Britain in the 1830s where witnesses before Parliamentary committees asserted
that Irish immigrants were crowding out native unskilled workers. The assertion has been
repeated often enough since. As Michael Greenwood and John McDowell (1986, 1745—

47) point out, it certainly has a long history in the United Stases. The debate reached a

crescendo there in 1911 after the Immigration Commission had pondered the problem for
five years. The Commission concluded that immigration contributed to low wages and
poor working conditions. What was said in the sending countries? The migrants and their

children clearly beneflued, but what about those left behind? in the early 1880s, it was
readily apparent where Knut Wicksell stood on this issue. Wicksell asserted that
emigration would solve the pauper problem which then blighted labor-abundant and landscazve Swedish agriculture. The 1954 Irish Commission on Emigration appears to have

shared Wicksell's view, at least as applied to Ireland. The Commission concluded that a
century of mass emigration had had a vety positive effect on Irish wages. In the worth of
the Irish Commissioners. "emigration.. .has reduced the pressure of population on

resources.. .and thus helped to maintain and even to increase our income per head' (1954,
140).

5The following four paragraphs draw on Matton and Williamson (1994 forthcoming-a, 20—21).

How did these authorities reach their conclusions? Historical correlations between
rates of labor force growth, migration, the real wage and labor productivity are unlikely to
offer any clear answer to the question. True, from 1870 to 1913 there is a positive
correlation between migration and pop ulation increase on the one hand and real wages on
the other, but such correlations tell us more about labor supply responses than about the

presence or absence of diminishing returns. In the absence of increasing returns, and in
the presence of a given technology and at least one fixed factor (like land), all
comparative static models in the classical Wicksellian tradition predict that migration
tends to make labor cheaper in the immigrating country and scarcer in the emigrating

country, especially in the short run when dynamic responses can be ignored. A familiar
partial equilibrium analysis of the assertion is offered in Figure 1. New World real wages
and marginal value productivities are on right and Old World real wages and marginal

value productivities on the left The "world" labor force is distributed between the two
regions along the horizontal axis. Derived labor demand in the Old World is denoted by
OW and in the New World by NW. L* is the distribution of labor that is consistent with
wage parity between the two regions, while the actual distribution at two points in the late
19th century is denoted by L70 and L90. The wage gaps in 1810 and 1890 are indicated

by GAP70 and GAP90. While estimation of Harberger triangles is not our goal in this

paper, one has been identified for 1890 by the shaded area. One could easily calculate the

dead-weight loss, however, as did Hamilton and Whalley (1984) for thecontemporary
world economy. One could also calculate the mass migration that would have been
required to eliminate wage gaps entirely. However, our purpose is instead to account for

the measured convergence across the late nineteenthcentury. Suppose all the labor force
redistribution over these two decades was attributable to mass migration. Suppose at the
same time there were independent Solovian accumulation events, Abramovitzian
technological catch-up, and Heckscher-Ohlin price shocks, all of which, at least on net,

favored the Old World, and thus induced a relative shift in Old World labordemand

—8—

upward to OW'. In that case, the observed convergence would have been measured by the
fall in the wage gap from GAP7O to GAP%', and mass migration would have accounted

for a share (GAP70 - GAP90)/(GAP — GAP%') of that fall.
There is no reason why the derived demand functions cannot be estimated. Given
data on wage gaps and labor force distributions, there is also no reason why
counterfacwal analysis cannot be applied to a diagram like Figure 1. Indeed, Figure 1 has
been drawn to be consistent with such late-nineteenth century estimates. Furthermore,
there is no reason why the two-region case in Figure 1 cannot be expanded to include our
17-country real-wage sample, allowing a decomposition of the contribution of mass

migration to the a-convergence observed before WWI.

Measuring thep of Migration on Convergence
Our multi-country study uses a counterfactual simulation approach. We first discuss the

counterfacwal and then explain the simulation technique. Our purpose is to assess
migration's role in accounting for convergence as measured by the decline in dispersion
between 1870 and 1910. The relevant data is shown in Table 3: real wage dispersion

declines by 28% over the period, GD!' per capita dispersion by 13% and GDP per worker
by 24%.6 What contribution did international migration make to that measured

convergence? To answer the question, we ask another: what would have been the
measured convergence 1870—1910 had there been no (net) migration? The no-migration

counterfactual invokes the ceteris paribw assumption: in each country, we adjust
population and labor force taking into account the avenge net migration rate observed
during the period, and we assume that technology, capital stocks, prices and all else

remain constant Such assumptions may impart an upward bias to our calculations, but
before pondering that possibility, let's see whether the magnitudes are large enough to
warrant further scrutiny.

6Dm dispersion measure is variance divided by mean squared; cf Table 1 where the square root of this
measure was adopted for coDsistency with Abramovi*z (1986).

A country with an observed cumulative net migration rate M, will be assumed to
experience a counterfactual population change of POP *= M(l—p) in the terminal year,
where we use X' to denote dX/X, and where p is a return-rate correction factor introduced
to allow for underenunierated return migration.7 Ceteris paribus, migration affects longrun equilibrium output and wages through its influence on aggregate labor supply L*. We

assume a standard aggregate production function for output, Y= FL,...). Under long-mn
full employment conditions, with competitive wages equal to labor's marginal product,

and inelastic labor supplies, the marginal productivity condition d Y= FL(L..) dL yields

the proportional output change equation I" = (wLIY)L* = OL*, where 0 is labor's share in
output, since (wIP) = FL(L,...). Differentiating the marginal productivity condition yields
the producer real wage impact (w/P)* = TrtL*, where q = Fwi (nIL) is the elasticity of
labor demand with respect to the wage holding all other inputs fixed. Under the ce:eris
paribus assumption, the price structure is invariant under the counterfactual so that the

impacts on the nominal wage, the producer real wage, and the consumer real wage are
identical: w* = (w/P) = (w/CPI)*, where CPJ is the consumer price deflator.

Thus, the long-nm migration impact on wages and output may be derived if
migrant streams of population measured by M(l—p) can be converted into labor supply

shocks V. Suppose, therefore, that for a given country a share aç of its migrant stream is
active in the labor force, whilst its total population has an active share upop. Moreover,
assume that migrants have an effective-worker (or worker-quality) ratio of ji with respect
to the total labor force—for example, a wage gap exists between the migrant stream and
the resident labor force due to, say, skill premia. Hence, the labor content of the

populaiionisL= appPOP,ancJ thelaborcontentofthemigrantflowisdL ixac
M(l.-p) POP. Defining y= aj.Jap0p (the migrant-to-population ratio of labor-force
participation rates) we obtain the expression V = tyM(l—p).

We can now derive the simulation equations used to calculate the impact of

The simulations use the above equations to assess the impact of the mass migrations
1870—1910 on convergence in our sample of countries.

The data requirements for the counterfactuals are described in appendix 2, but we
offer a brief summaiy here. For real GDP, population and labor force estimates we use
Maddison's (1991) latest study, with extensions, adjustments and modifications to bring
Argentina, Brazil, Portugal, and Spain into the study, and to split the United Kingdom

into Great Britain and Ireland. For real wages we use Williamson's (1994 forthcoming)

long-nm database on internationally comparable real wages. For migration time series we
use Wilcox (1929—31) and other standard sources.

We know much more about some parameters than others. Return migration is
poorly documented in most official data, but we know that it ranged from very high for
Italians to almost zero for the Irish and the Scandinavians.8 The baseline assumption
invoked here is that an appropriate correction for underenumeration of return migration is

to setp at 0.1, with sensitivity analysis in the range 0.0-0.3. Migrant quality is also
poorly documented, and the same movers may have exhibited different quality relative to
stayers in the sending and receiving countries. The baseline assumption has been to set
the effective worker ratio p. = 0.8 since, although we have little evidence relating to the

size of migrant-versus-local wage or productivity gaps, we know that immigrants were

counnies is provided by Nugent (1992). Our assumptions are not inconsistent with such Sma as the
return rates in our raw data suggest (sec appendix 2).

—11—

considered low quality in the United States and that they typically entered at the bottom
of the job ladder.9 Still, given other scholars' concerns that Europe suffered a brain drain

by the loss of the best and the brightest, we later subject t to sensitivity analysis in the

range 0.8-1.2. Note that an understatement of j.ior ytends to understate the impact on
GDP per capita while overstating the impact on the real wage and labor productivity.
Thus, sensitivity analysis is especially important for these two parameters given the
several measures of convergence being studied.

The parameter 7 (relative labor participation rates) is based on detailed studies of
Anglo-American experience (Kuznets 1952; O'Rourke, Williamson and Hatton 1994
forthcoming). A priori, we expect yto exceed unity, since migrant streams self-select and

have a relatively high proportion of young adult males. Thus, the labor content of the

migrant stream will be skewed by the presence of an over-representation of working-age
adults, and by the over-representation of males with high participation rates. Guided by
activity rates alone, we might guess CLM to have been around 90%, cxpop around 60%,

and, hence, y around 1.5 for most countries. Estimates of y from the United States and
Britain document a range of 1.53—1.78 for the late nineteenth century, and a mid-point

estimate of 1.65 was chosen as the baseline parameter subject to sensitivity analysis in the
range 1.55—1.75. Labor's share (9) is documented in various country-studies of factor

disthbution, most of which were done in the 1960s. These estimates of 8 were
supplemented by constructing alternative estimates of 8= wLIY from data on avenge
nominal wages (w), nominal output (Y) and labor force (L). Independent estimates of S
were thus derived for almost all countries, with the remainder covered by contiguous country estimates (for example, Brazil uses Argentina's 0 estimate).

Lastly, an estimate of was obtained using standard estimation techniques for
aggregate labor demand (Haznennesh 1993). Appendix 1 discusses in detail the

estimation of . For any (degree one) homogenous two-factor production function it can
be shown that

=—a/(l—8). The elasticity of substitution a was estimated

econometrically with a late nineteenth century panel of 14 countries, with four decada]

observations for each country. Under a CES production function, Y= (aLP +bAy) 1/p
can be shown that producer wages wIP are related to aggregate output per worker

according to ln( YIL) = a ln(wIP), where a

= l/(1—p) is the elasticity of substitution.

Estimates of a may be taken from a number of estimating equations (Hamermesh 1993;

Anow, eta!. 1961):

(4)

ln(YIL)=aln(w/P)

(5)

ln(wIP) = (lie) In(YIL)

(6)

ln(L) = p ln( }) — a In (wIP), testing the restriction p = 1.

Appendix 1 reports the estimation of these equations using panel fixed-effect econometric
techniques on a 14-country subsample over the four decades 1870-1910. The three

estimates of a so derived were 0.22,0.62 and 0.87. The middle value of 0.62 was used in
the baseline estimates of q, but all three values were used in the sensitivity analysis.

The Contribution of Mass Migration to Convergence
Table 4 presents our baseline results. The upper panel shows counterfactual real wages,

GDP per capita, and GDP per worker in 1910 under the counterfactual assumption of
zero net migration after 1870 in all countries. The second panel indicates the
proportionate impact with respect to the actual levels for each country shown in Table 3.

The third and fourth panels report counterfactual convergence or divergence.
The results certainly accord with intuition: in the absence of migration, wage and
labor productivity levels would have been much higher in the New World and much

lower in the Old; and in the absence of migration, income per capita levels would
typically (but not always) have been marginally higher in the New World and typically

—

13 —

(but not always) marginally lower in the Old. Not surprisingly, the biggest counterfactual
impact is seen in the countries that experienced the biggest migrations: by 1910, Irish

wages would have been lower by 31%, Italian by 23% and Swedish by 10%; and
Argentine wages would have been higher by 36%, Australian by 22%, Canadian by 25%

and American by 12%. Labor productivities would have been similarly affected: up in the
New World from 7% (U.S.) to 21% (Argentina), and down in the Old World by as much
as 20% (Ireland) or 15% (Italy).
There are only a few such country-specific estimates reported in what is otherwise
an enormous literature on the mass migrations, but what few there are seem to be roughly
consistent with those reported in the second panel of Table 4. For example, about two
decades ago one of the present authors (Williamson 1974, 387) used a computable

general equilibrium model to estimate that in the absence of immigration U.S. real wages
would have been 11% higher in 1910 (here estimated to be 12% higher), and income per

capita 3% higher (matching the present estimate). More recently, another computable

general-equilibrium application to the U.S. found the impact to have been 34% in 1910

(O'Rourke, Williamson and NatIon 1994 forthcoming). Britain offers another example;
O'Rourke, Wiffiamson and Nation estimate that emigration served to raise the real wage

by 12% in 1910 (here estimated to be 7%). A Norwegian study (Pus and Thonstad 1989,

Table 8.6) found the impact of emigration to have raised income per capita in 1910 by
6% (here estimated to be 2%). A study for Sweden (Karlstrom 1985, Table 6.4) found the

1890 impact of emigration to have raised wages by 9% and income per

capita by 2% (our

figures, for 1910, art 10% and 2% respectively). While estimates obviously vary
somewhat in the literature, generally there seems to be a fair degree ofagreement among

them and with our own, especially given that they were estimated in very different ways
and under widely different assumptions.
Overall, the results in Table 4 lend strong support to the hypothesis that mass

migration made an important contribution to convergence in the late nineteenth century.

Starting with the third panel first, we observe that real wage dispersion would have

increased 25% 1870—1910, in contrast to the actual 28% decline seen (Table 3). GD!' per
worker dispersion would have declined only 7% (versus actual, 24%), and GD!' per
capita dispersion would have declined only 7% (versus actual. 14%). New World-Old
World wage gaps actually declined from 96% in 1870 to 79% in 1910, but in the absence

of mass migration they would have risen to 134% in 1910 (19% counteifactual rise
versus 9% actual decline).

Pairwise comparisons are also easily constructed using Table 4 aud compounding
the percentages. Wage gaps (measured here as New World premia) between many Old
World countries and the U.S. fell dramatically as a result of mass migration: without Irish
emigration (some of which went to America) and U.S immigration (some of which was
Irish), the American-Irish wage gap would have risen from 134% to 201%, while in fact
it fell to 86%; without Italian emigration (a large share of which went to America) and
U.S. immigration (much of it Italian), the American-Italian wage gap would have risen

from 342% to 387%, while in fact it fell to 240%; without British emigration and
Australian immigration, the Australian-British wage gap would have fallen only from
84% to 68%, while in fact it fell to 29%; and without Italian emigration and Argentine
immigration, the Argentine-Italian wage gap would have risen from 135% to 23 1%,

while in fact it fell to 90%. Furthermore, the mass migrations to the New World had an
impact on economic convergence within the Old World: without the Swedish emigration
flood and the German emigration trickle, the German-Swedish wage gap would have
inverted from 107% (German higher) to 6% (Swedish higher), while in fact it inverted as

far as 15% (in favor of the Swedes); and without the fact that Irish emigration exceeded
British emigration by far, the British-Irish wage gap would have risen from 41% to 55%,

while in fact it fell to 15%. Although the impact of mass migration within the Old World
was much smaller than between the Old and New World. remember the caveat that

—15—

migrations within Europe were underenumerated, a bias working against our migration convergence hypothesis.

A summary of results is shown in Table 5. Notably, C3DP per capita dispersion is
least affected in our analysis. In terms of the convergence accounted for by migration, the
counterfactuals suggest that more than all (168%, log measure of dispersion) of the real
wage convergence 1870—1910 was attributable to migration, and almost three-quarters

(73%) of the GDP per worker convergence. In contrast, maybe one half (50%) of the
GDP per capita convergence might have been due to migration.
The contribution of mass migration to convergence in the full sample and in the

New and Old World differ, the latter being smaller and in some cases evennegative.
There is, we think, no cause for concern. Indeed, it is consistent with intuition. First, it
should come as no surprise that New World impacts axe small oreven negative by some
measures, given the segmentation in the global labor market. To some extent, immigrant

flows were not efficiently distiibuted, since barriers toentry limited destination choices
for many southern Europeans, a point central to discussions of Latin migration
experience, and invoked as an important determinant of Argentine economic performance
(DIaz-Aiejandro 1970; Hatton and Williamson 1994 forthcoming-b; Taylor 1992;Taylor
1994 forthcoming). Thus migrants did not always obey some simple market-wage
calculus; kept out of the best high-wage destinations, or having alternative cultural
preferences, many went to the "wrong" countries. The South-South flows from Italy,
Spain and Portugal to Brazil and Argentina were a strong force for local (Latin), not
global, convergence. Second, barriers to exit were virtually nil in the Old World, but

policy (like assisted passage) still played a part in violating any simple market-wage
calculus.'° However, the small contribution of'migration to convergence in each region

illustrates our opening point the major contribution of mass migration to late nineteenth

our sample barrjts to exit did exist—most emigration from Russia was illegal. On this, and for
a more detailed discussion of migration policy, sec Fcgcman-Peck (1992) and Nugent (1992).

—16—

century convergence was the enormous movement of almost 50 million Europeans to the
New World, and the impact this movement had on convergence between .the two regions.

The real wage convergence, as noted elsewhere, is in large part due to a narrowing of
NewWorld-Old World wage gaps, which fall from 96% in 1870 to 79% in 1910. The
New World-Old World story stands in contrast to the quantitatively less important
convergence within each region, an effect only further obscured by the imperfect wage -

flow correlation (Williamson 1994 forthcoming).
The relative insensitivity of ODP per capita convergence to migration is a result
of countervailing effects inherent in the algebra. For real wages or GDP per worker,
higher values of y (the migrant-co-population ratio of labor-force participation rates)

amplify the impact of migration, but with ODP per capita the impact is muted. Why? In
the former two cases, migration has a bigger impact on GDP, wage levels and labor force,

the bigger is the relative labor content of the migrations. In the case of GDP per capita,
the impacts are less clear. For example, with emigration, population outflow generally
offsets diminishing returns in production, leaving a net positive impact on output per

capita but skewed demographics in the emigrant stream (y> 1) will take away a
disproportionate share of the labor force, lowering output via labor supply losses, a
negative impact on output per capita. The two exactly cancel out when, in equation (2), j.t

ye = 1. Indeed, for even higher y, emigration will, perversely, lower ODP per capita
through the then-dominant negative labor supply effect In our sample, i = 0.8 by
assumption, y = 1.65 is the baseline value, and so 0 = 0.758 is the critical value. The
sample 0 range from 0.41 (Belgium) to 0.64 (U.S.). so muted GDP per capita effects axe
no surprise. By our calculation, four decades of immigration lowered GDP per capita by
only as much as 7% anywhere in the New World (Argentina), and by as little as 3% in the
U.S., to be contrasted with GDP per worker impacts of 21% and 7% respectively. This

labor-supply compensation effect operated in addition to the usual human-capital transfer
effects invoked to describe the net benefit to the U.S. of the millions received before

—17—

WWI (Uselding 1971; Neal and Uselding 1972). Similar reasoning applies to the Old

World: ireland, for all its emigration, and perhaps about a 30% resulting rise in wages,
only gained about 10% in GDP per capita through the labor so vented; Swedish
emigration after 1870 may have raised wages by about 10%, but it served to raise GDP
per capita by only 2%.

Table 6 explores the sensitivity of our results to various parameter values. The
results seem robust for real wages and GDP per worker: for most parameter
combinations, actual convergence is more than half explained by migration, and
frequently overexplained. As a conservative estimate, we could assert that mass migration
accounted for at least half the real wage convergence and at least one third of the GDP
per worker convergence, even assuming an extreme adjustment for return-rate
underenumeration of about 30% (p = 0.3), which we think implausibly high except for
one or two countries (for example, Italy). Using a more moderate correction of p =0.1,
our estimates suggest that migration conuibuted at least 100% of the real wage

convergence and at least 70% of the GDP per worker convergence.
Finally, note the extreme sensitivity of the GDP per capita impact to parameter

assumptions. This should now come as no surprise given the previous discussion. When ji
or yare allowed to rise (so that .tyO> 1), the perverse divergence effect of migration

appears for GDP per capita. Thus, our results raise another qualification to the
convergence debate: when modeling migration and convergence, demographic
considerations suggest care be taken in the selection of variable documenting
convergence.

Qualifying the Bottom Line
Our baseline results argue that the mass migrations accounted for 168% of the realwage
convergence observed in our sample of 17 New World and Old World countries between
1870 and 1910. Have we overexplained late nineteenth century convergence? Perhaps.

but the fact is hardly surprising given that there were other powerful pro- and anti -

—18—

convergence forces at work. Four of these deserve stress. First, what about Solovian
capital accumulation forces? We know that capital accumulation was faster in the New

World, so much so that the rate of capital deepening was faster in the U.S. than in any of
her competitors (Wolff 1991), and the same was probably true of other rich New World
countries. There is evidence therefore that the mass migrations may have been at least
partially offset by capital accumulation, and a large part of that capitai widening was
being carried by international capital flows which reached magnitudes unsurpassed before
or since (Edelstein 1982; Zevin 1992). Second, what about the forces of trade of which so
much was made by Eli Heckscher in 1919 and Bertil Ohlin in 1924 (Earn and Flanders

1991)? Their idea was that spectacular transport innovations in the late 19th century
caused commodity prices to converge and trade to boom. As exports expanded among

trading partners, the derived demand for their abundant factors boomed while that for
their scarce factors slumped. Factor prices (like real wages) tended to converge as a
result. Samuelson (1948) got us thinking about the strong assumptions needed for factor
price equalization, but factor price convergence requires weaker assumptions and they are

supported by the late nineteenth century evidence (O'Rourke and Williamson 1992;
O'Rourke, Taylor and Williamson 1993). Third, what about the forces of technological
catch up stressed by Gerschenkron (1962) and Abrarnovitz (1986), but documented only
poorly for the late 19th century (Wolff 1991)? Finally, what about the forces of human
capital accumulation so prevalent in the new growth theory, and which have been
suggested as an important force for convergence in the late 19th century (Easterlin 1981;
Sandberg 1979)?
Insofar as that schooling is a good proxy for human capital accumulation, we can
reject at least one of these four forces quickly: schooling was not an important force
accounting for real wage or labor productivity convergence in the late 19th century

(O'Rourke and Williamson 1994; Prados de la Escosura, Sanchez and Oliva 1993). But
what about the other three forces? Although the evidence is still fragile, we do know

—

19—

something about the relative importance of Heckscher-Ohlin trade-related forces: they
may have accounted for as much as a third of the real wage convergence in the late 19th

century (O'Rourke, Williamson and Hatton 1994 forthcoming; O'Rourke, Taylor and
Williamson 1993; O'Rourke and Williamson 1992) .1 The evidence on the role of global
capital market responses is even more tentative, but it suggests that perhaps as much as
two-thirds of the mass migrations were offset by international capita] chasing after labor.
Figure 2 offers a stylized treatment of these informed guesses. Here we consider

dispersion for a group of countries whose level indicatory (say, real wages) is converging
on the group mean y(O) according to yi(t) = )tj(t) + Ijctje-', where). is the convergence

speed, and Ia = 0 by assumption. CV(t) = CV(O)e—At is the coefficient of variation
(standard deviation divided by the mean), and our dispersion measure DJSP is a C¼

index, so that DJSP(:) = DJSP(O)e-DJ. What determines X? As we have argued above.
several forces contributed positively to convergence in the late 19th century, not only

mass migration (labor market integration forces, labeled LMI in Figure 2), but also
commodity price convergence (commodity market integration forces, labeled CMI), and
any number of residual forces (RESID) such as technological catch up, unmeasured intraEuropean migration, human capital accumulation and the like. Conversely, and as we

pointed out above, our panial-equilibriuin assessment of mass migration's impact does
not account for the mass migration of capital from Old World to New, some of it chasing
after labor and all of it chasing after abundant natural resources. The dual scarcity of
labor and capital in the open spaces of the New World was the key international factor
market disequilibrium of that era., and it implied massive flows of both mobile factors

(Green and Urquhart 1976). International capital market integration was probably as well
developed by the turn of the century as it is now (Neal 1985; Neal 1990; Zevin 1992).
Yet, the capital flows of the late nineteenth century were an anti-convergence force, in

Concluding Remarks
This paper suggests that the convergence literature has missed two crucial features of the
late 19th century world economy. First, the key axis around which convergence centered
was between old World and New: along that axis hangs most of the convergence story for

real wages 1870-1913 (Williamson 1994 forthcoming). Second. the conventional closedeconomy assumption is simply inappropriate given the degree of integration in the world
economy at that time, whether in goods markets, labor markets or capital markets. These

insights have been applied elsewhere. In other papers, Kevin ORourke and the present
authors have shown that integration in product markets arising from spectacular ocean
and railroad freight declines could account for much of the Anglo-American real wage

convergence; and for a broader group of countries, terms-of-trade effects and endowment
changes could account for a large share of the convergence in the wage-rental ratio. In
short, an open-economy perspective is vital to understanding late 19th century

convergence (O'Rourke and Williamson 1992; O'Rourke, Taylor and Williamson 1993;
O'Rourke and Williamson 1994; O'Rourke, Williamson and Hatton 1994 forthcoming).
Will our pathal equilibrium analysis of late 19th century mass migration hold up
to closer scrutiny? It certainly will need more sophisticated analysis to help confirm it:

general-equilibrium capital-chasing effects could offset more of the mass migration
impact than we allow in Figure 2, in which case technological catching-up might be claim

more than the residual role history appears to have assigned it. Still, we expect our results
to offer a new perspective on the convergence debate, one relevant for economic

historians and macroeconomists. The convergence power of free migration, when it is
tolerated, is likely to be substantial given the late 19th century evidence. Cheap labor did

—21—

not wait for foreign capital to seek it out, nor did it ignore distant immobile natural
resources that beckoned labor to move; it did not wait for human capital accumulation or
spillovers to initiate catching up at home, it just went. Convergence explanations based
on technological or accumulation catching-up in closed-economy models miss this point.

The millions on the move in the late 19th century didn't

APPENDIX 1: LABOR DEMAND ECONOME1RICS
The underlying objective of our regression analysis was to estimate the elasticity of substitution, at in both
the New World and Old World. The estimate of a was used, along with independent information on 9,
labor's share of income (see Appendix 2), to ovide an estimate of q - Fu.,1 (w/L), the shoit-run wage

elasticity of labor demand holding all other inpias fixed, and, thus, an estimate of the impact of migrationinduced labor-supply shocks on wages.
In this first appendix we discuss the econometic methodology. Dan sources for the econometric
estimation (and for the rest of the paper) are documented in the second appendix. Data for the econometrics

consisted of a 14 county sample with annual estimates of real GDP. labor force, and real wages, from
which "decadal" averages (1870-79, 1880-89, 1890-99. and 1900-13) were daived to generate a panel with.
four observations for each country.

Esthnation Strategy and Results

Estimates of B were directly constructed. In order to estimate a econometrically we utilized a late 19th
century panel of 14 counties, with four decadal observations for each county (see Appendix 2). and a set
of CES-derived estimating equations.
Under a CES production function, I =(aLP + bKP)11P it can be shown that producer wages wIP

are related to aggregate output pa worker according to ln(T/L)= a ln(wIP), where o=l/(l—p) is the CES
elasticity of substitution. Estimates of a may be taken from a number of estimating equations:

(Al)

ln(IIL)acln(wIP)

(A2)
ln(wIP) = (1/a) ln( 17L)
(AS)
ln(L)=Un(})-alnØsdP),teslingtheresthcUont= 1.
Two different theoretical frameworks formed the basis for our estimation strategy. The first
follows the example of Arrow, Chenety, Mlnhas, and Solow (ACMS), by estimating log value-added per
worker as a function of the log real wage, as in (Al).12 The basic estimation equation in this case was:

We could reject the hypothesis that the constant terms are constant across countries. Allowing the slope

coefficients to differ across countries as well, however, did not yield significantly different estimates.

The second theoretical framework used to generate estimates of a was based on a version (A3) of
the marginal productivity condition (MPC):

(MW) ln(L)j-aj+tln(}Oa-aln(w/P)j+cj
The same strategy was used to implement this estimation equation, using country fixed effects,'3 Estimates

did vary substantially from those obtained using (ACMS). In this case, however, one cannot reject the
hypothesis that coefficients on both the constant and slope terms differ across countries:

Linzitadons ofOur Esthnthon Approach
Given the limitations of late 19th century and early 20th century data, we were forced to rely on estimation
approaches which did not require information on capital stock prices or quantities. This means that care
must be taken in interpreting our results—we are actually estimating the gross elasticity of labor demand,
rather than the constant-output demand elasticity. This implies that we an measuring substitution along an
iso-labor curve, rather than along an iso-output curve. In general, one would expect that the gross

elasticities will be lower in absolute value than the constant-output elasticities, as an increase in the wage
would likely lead to a reduction in the labor employed.14
There is also the problem that we ignore the simultaneous determination of labor supply. Because
we do not have a ñilly specified model we must make a decision as to whether the price or quantity of labor
should be considered exogenous. Given that we are using highly aggregated data, it is somewhat
implausible to assume that labor supply is highly elastic. Iflabor supply is instea4 relatively inelastic, it is
better to use specifications In which the quantity of labor is exogenous.15 OLS estimates using wages as a

regressor will yield inconsistent parameter estimates if factor prices are indeed endogenous)6 An
alternative is to use the reciprocal relationship (RR.) of the ACMS equation, i.e., (A)), as the basis for an
estimation equation:
(RB)

ln(MP)-aj+(I/a)ln(Y/L)j+q

Estimates based on this estimation equation did in fact differ substantiallyfrom those obtained using real
wages as a regressor

13k should be noted that estimates ofM obtained using this dual approach are comparable to our earlier
estimates only if the share of labor in total costs, equals the share of labor in thcome a. This is true under
the assumptions of perfect competition and linear homogeneous production and cost functions.

Compwton to Existh,g Estimata of a
There already exists & large empirical literature which attempts toestimate the elasticity of substitution.
both in the context of labor demand and production functions. These studies have generated estimates ofa
which vary substantially and depend very strongly on the choice of the estimation equations and data.
Hamamesh extensively surveys the empirical labor demand literature. Those studies which are
most comparable to our estimates are 15 studies of homogeneous labor demand utilizing data at the
aggregate or large industry level to estimate a. Most of these studies directly estimated a using some
variant of the marginal productivity condition. Estimates of a ranged from 0.21 to 6.86, although was
between 0.3 and 0.8 in two-thirds of the studies. Hamermesh surveyed approximately 70 studies which
utilized aggregate data, and concluded that the mean estimate of a was 0.75.19
The other major branch of the literature is based on the CES production function and estimation
equations similar to ACMS. According to Berndt, those studies which have utilized cross-sectionaJ data

a

have generated estimates close to one, while estimates based on time series data have generally been lower.

Berndt was able to reconcile these difftrences by improving the quality of the time series data, resulting in

estimates of a closer to one.2°
Our a estimates generally fall within the ranges estimated in previous studies and also demonstrate
the same dependence on the choice of functional form. Our best estimates are probably those obtained

using the fixed effects model with uniform slopes.21 An estimate of a equal to 0.22 was obtained based on
the marginal productivity condition. The estimate based on the ACMS approach was closer to the middle of
the range at 0.62. while the reciprocal relationship generated an estimate of 0.87.

1tBerndt (ibid.) shows that estimates of a based on the reciprocal relationship will systematically be higher
than those obtained using equation 1, and our estimates follow this pattern.

'8flamennesh. op. cit.
19The only study which utilized data from more than one country was that of Drazen, Hamermesh, and
Obst. The study did not utilize .a aoss-countiy panel, but instead estimated separate time sales regressions
for 10 OECI) countries. Estimates of-q ranged from .448 in Australia to -.184 in France. and averaged

Theory and Evidence" in It U. Threnbe'g (edj, Researchin Labor Economics, volume 6, Greenwich,
Conn.: IA! Press, 1984.
20Hamamesh does not include these studies in his survey, as they were not primarily interested in
determining labor demand elasticities. For a survey of this literature see Berndt, op. cit.; and Berndt, E. R.,
The Practice of Econometrics, Classic and Coiuempora,y, pndg, Mass.: Addjson-WesJey. 1991, pp.
211t should be noted, however, that in the case of both the marginal productivity relation (MPC) and the
reciprocal production function (RR), we could rejectthe hypothesis that both the slope coefficients and
constant terms are constant across countries (though for RR the rejection is borderline). Estimating a total
of 28 or 42 parameters based on only 56 observations seems inadvisable at best.

APPENDIX 2: ECONOMETRIC AND SIMULATION DATA
ECONOMETRIC DATA

The 14 countries in our econometric sample were those countries included in Williamson's 'tvolution of
Global Labor Markets" (Ezplorwioiu in Economic History. 1994, forthcoming) for which real GD? data
was also available. The countries are: Belgium, Denmark, France. Germany, Great Britain, Italy, the
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Australia, Canada. and the United States. Annual estimates
for real GD?, labor force, and real wages were calculated, and then decadal averages (1870-79. 1880-89,
1890-99, and 1900-13) were utilized to generate the four observations for each country. The idea was to
focus on benchmark observations, ignoring short-mn annual variations, thus emerging with a panel totaling

56 observations. In each case, we attempted to exclude the impact of territorial changes.
SIMULATION DATA

The simulation exercises utilized the above data and additional data on real wages (at the benchmark years
1870 and 1910). GD? per capita (at benchmark years), GD? per worker (at benchmark years), labor's share
in income (best estimates available) and avergage migration rates (between benchmark years) for all 17

countries—the above mentioned 14 plus Argentina, Brazil and Ireland.

GREAT BRITAIN

Maddison's estimates of real GD? for the United Kingdom correct for Irish independence but still include
Northern Ireland. Because we are interested in focusing on Great Britain, we wanted to exclude Northern
Ireland's contribution to output from our data series, In order to exclude the output contribution of the
of C. IL Feinstein (Stwirtical Tables of
Republic of Ireland we utilized the "compromisCGDP index

1972. T18-20). Maddison includes two estinI2tes of 113 real GDP (in millions of 1985 U.S. dollars) for
the U.K., one which Is adjusted for border changes (i.e., excludes the Republic of Ireland). and another
which is unadjusted. Feinstein's index was combined with both of these GDP estimates to calculate 1920
GDP for the UK both including the Republic of Ireland ($174,154 million) and excluding it ($167,724
million). This provides us with an estimate of Irish GDP in 1920 of $6,430 a Combined with information
on the population of the Irish republic (3,103,000 in 1920, from Feinstein, op. cit., T120-1). we can also
calculate GD? per head in Ireland ($2,072). If we then assume that GD? per head was the same in Northern

Ireland as In the Republic of Ireland (an understatement of Northern Ireland's relatively favorable
economic condition), this implies that Northern Ireland accounted for $2,607 million of the U.K.'s output in
1920 (given a population of 1,258.000). We can then subtract this figure from $167,724 million (UK GD?
after Irish independence) to generate an estimate of Great Britain's GD? in 192th $165,118 million. Given
a population of 42.460.000. this implies a GD? per person of $3,889. This implies that each inhabitant of
Great Britain produced 1.877 times more output than each inhabitant of Ireland in 1920. We assumed that
this productivity differential was constant throughout the 1870-1920 period. We thereforedivided the
population of Ireland by 1.877 to calculate a productivity-adjusted population (where each "population
unit" in Ireland and Great Britain produces the same output). Great Britain's share of the productivity.
adjusted population in each year was then multiplied by total U.K. output to derive an estimate of GD? in
Great Britain for the years 1870.1913.
PORTUGAL

The real GDP index for 1870 to 1985 was taken from A. B. Nunes, E. Mats, and N. Valeno, "Portuguese

Economic Growth 1833-1985," Journal of European Economic History 18.2 (Fall 1989). Tablet. pp. 2925. This was then combined with OWl) estimates of 1985 Portuguese real GD? at current PPP exchange

SPAIN

The real GD? index for 1870 to 1985 was derived from L. Prados de Ia Escostna, "Spain's Gross Domestic

Spanish real GD? at current PPP exchange rates. (OECD, op. cit., p. 145).

Population (POP)
Population estimates were sought at the 1870 and 1910 benchmark years. For most countries we used midyear estimates from Maddison. op. cit.. Table B,2. For consistesucy with the GD? data, 1870 figures for
France exclude Alsace-Lorraine, for Germany include Alsace-Lorraine, and for Italy include Rnme. all as

Labor Force (L)
Labor force estimates for most countries were based on Maddison, op. cit., although we were unable to
replicate his data and it is unclear how he determined the Foportion of the working age population, which
was in the labor force. Estimates of the working age population were obtained for census years, and annual
observations were then obtained by interpolation. If necessaiy, mid-year observations were calculated by

averaging the annual estimates of working age population. Maddison's estimates of the labor force in 1870
and 1913 were then compared to the working age population in those years. Theaverage ratio of the labor
force over the working age population in those three years was then calculated. This ratio was then
multiplied by our annual estimates of the mid-year working age population to generate annual estimates of
the labor force.

Consumer Real Wages (W/CPI)
The consumer real wages for each country are based on the international real wage indices developed in
Williamson, op. cit. lnternatlonally'comparable real wages were calculated for several base years by
utilizing purchasing-power-parity (F??) exchange rates. These senes were then deflated by consumer price
indices (CPIs) to obtain the international real wagescales. We used the 1870-1913 indices with the real
wage in Great Britain in 1905 equal to 100. The data was used to give consumer real wages in S
benchmark years of 1870 and 1910, and to enable estimation of producer real wages (see below).

Producer Real Wages (WIP)
In estimating labor demand the correct deflator for the nominal wage is the output deflator; i.e., we needed

an estimate of producer real wages. To that end we adjusted Williamson's international real wages for most
counties: we essentially reflated most of the real wages using a CPL and then deflated them once again
utilizing wholesale price indices (WPI). Unless otherwise noted, WPI were taken from B. R. Mitchell's
to
!HSE (Table HI, pp. 840.2) and !HSAA (Table Il, pp. 835439). In order to make the WPI comparable
the consumer price Index (C?!) utilized in Williamson (1994), the WP1 were re-based so that the index in
1900 was equal to 100. The ratio of the CPI to the WPI was then multiplied by Williamson'sinternational
real wage, effectively deflating the nominal wage by the WPI while maintaining the international
comparability of the data.
AUSI'RAUA

Williamson's international real wage series for Australia was based directly on real rather than nominal
wages. No continuous CPI or WPI were available. so we utilized Williamson's real wage series without an

adjustment

Labor's Shore of laconic (9)
Three approaches were used to obtain estimates of 9:
(a) any existing direct estimates of 9 were examined;
(b) an implied 9= wL(1-u)/Y was calculated using estimates of wage rates, labor force, assumed
unemployment rates, as, and output;

(c) if all else failed, "neighbor" country estimates were used.

wages somewhat more, with a typical 1900 disiribution of labor being at least 40% rural (or most countries.

(a)

Implied 0.0.600. There are several available estimates of labor's share in the United States, although

the pre-War data Is of questionable quality. W. King calculated the earliest estimates, and these were
subsequently revised (generally downward) by Budd. King's estimate of 533% In 1890 is roughly
comparable to that of Haley for the 1900-1909 period (55.0%). although King's figures show labor's share
contracting in both 1900 and 1910. Mactin's data (taken from D.C. Johnson (1954)) represents an upper
bound (593% for 1899-1908 and 59.7% for 1909-1918). We considered ecthnttes of 50% (the average of
King's data for 1870-1910) and 55% (Haley's 1900-09 and 1905-14 figures). We chose 60% as an upperbound based on Martin. Edward C. Budd, "Factor Shares, 1850-191(7' in National Bureau of Economic

Migiution Rates (hi)
Decadai averages are shown in Table Al. Where only gross flows were available additional assumptions
were trade to allow estimates of net flows:
Ireland: since return migration was rare, and there were no inflows from other countries, we set
net equal to gross.
italy. the ratio of net to gross falls from .78to.72 between the 1890s and 1900s, a modest fall
given the surge in return migration; a oude linear projection backwards might have that ratio at
.84 in the lSSOs and .90 in the 1870s; hence, we assume the net rate to have been 3.86 in the 1870s
ands.12 in the iSBOs.
Sweden: we project net to gross ratio backwards to the 1870s to be 0.95; hence, we assume net rate

in lS7Oswas2.8l.
Norway: we assume net to gross ratio is like Sweden; we apply Swedish net/gross ratios by decade
1870—1910.

Ponugal: we assume net to gross ratio is like Spain; we apply Spanish net/gross ratios by decade
1880-1910, and we assume 1870s ratio was equal to the 188 ratio.
Spain: we assume rates the same as Portugal In the 1870s.
Brazil: we use the net to gross ratio from the 1890s (0.17) for 1870s and 1880s.
Data was sought on gross and net migration rates for all countries. Annual migratory (lows were converted
into rates using interpolated census estimates of population. Data (or 1870-1910 extracted from the

following sources, with exceptions as indicated bdow
