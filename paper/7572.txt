Keiretsu and Relationship-Specific Investment:
A Barrier to Trade?
Barbara J. Spencer and Larry D Qiu
NBER Working Paper # 7572
February 2000
JEL No. F12
ABSTRACT
This paper develops a model of informal procurement within Japanese keiretsu so as to
consider effects on intermediate-good imports, such as auto parts. Parts-suppliers make relationshipspecific investments that benefit the auto-maker and prices are determined by bargaining after
investment has been sunk. Although this investment raises efficiency, it limits the range of imports
to less important parts such as tail pipes and it is possible that no parts are imported, despite lower
foreign production costs. Lack of information concerning investment rents combined with
counterintuitive effects on imports and Japanese production costs could create unwarranted
perceptions of a trade barrier.

KEIRETSU AND RELATIONSHIP-SPECIFIC INVESTMENT:
A BARRIER TO TRADE?

1. INTRODUCTION
Persistent and large deficits in U.S. trade with Japan, reaching US$55.7 billion in 1997, have
led to significant economic tension between the two countries. Since US$32.2 billion of this 1997
deficit, or 58%, involved automobile trade, with US$10 billion attributable to trade in auto-parts1,
it is not surprising that a main focus of tension has been auto and auto-parts trade. Indeed, a trade
dispute over autos almost resulted in a trade war between the U.S. and Japan in 1995. Since it is
evident that visible and formal trade barriers, such as tariffs and import quotas, applied to
manufactures are low in Japan, the central U.S. complaint is that invisible and informal barriers
arising from typical Japanese business practices and regulations have substantially blocked legitimate
access of American products to the Japanese market.
Particularly with respect to auto-parts, the concern is that vertical relationships within
Japanese corporate groups, known as keiretsu, could act as a structural impediment to trade2. The
special nature of these relationships is perhaps one of the most distinguishing features of the
Japanese auto industry. Auto producers, such as Nissan and Toyota, are involved in long term
arrangements with their keiretsu suppliers or subcontractors. As explained by Aoki (1988; pp 216-

See, for example, Levinsohn (1997). According to Church (1995), the keiretsu “do business mainly with
each other, freezing out competing buyers and sellers, both foreign and domestic. This system forms the very
fabric of the way the Japanese do business, and it does more than outright trade barriers or even government
`administrative guidance’ to keep out foreign products. Especially, it seems, U.S. auto parts. ...Some U.S.
auto parts such as shock absorbers, mufflers, tailpipes and disk-brake pads...sell for less than half to only a
third the price of made-in-Japan parts of comparable quality. What then limits American parts to around
1.5% of the Japanese market? The keiretsu system, Americans conclude”.



218)3, in return for long term commitment by the automaker, subcontractors make relationshipspecific investments that are specifically directed towards the needs of the auto maker and are of no
value to firms outside the keiretsu group. Such investments would include the design costs of
modifications that improve the fit or ease of assembly with other parts produced by the keiretsu, but
which are not of relevance to the particular production process of other auto manufacturers. Another
example might involve investment by the supplier in “just in time” delivery, such as building a plant
close to the auto-maker’s plant or cooperating with other suppliers to coordinate delivery4. “Just in
time” production methods are a prominent feature of Japanese supply arrangements. A main aim of
this paper is then to determine the effects of these relationship-specific investments within keiretsu
on the ability of foreign suppliers to export auto parts or other intermediate inputs to Japan.
To explore this issue, we develop a model of procurement with the feature that, within the
keiretsu, relationship-specific investments by suppliers create rent5 for the automaker. In keeping
with the informal nature of supply arrangements, auto-parts prices are determined through bargaining
between individual suppliers and the automaker after investment has been sunk. A key aspect of the
model is its consideration of a large variety or range of parts so as to define the margin at which a
part is imported or produced within the keiretsu. As we show, relationship-specific investment limits
access to the Japanese market by making it profitable for the keiretsu to produce a range of parts that
otherwise would be imported. The rents from these investments create a net benefit to the keiretsu

As Aoki (1988; p216) states, "the prime manufacturer must maintain its reputation of commitment to the
subcontractor in order to elicit the subcontractor's commitment regarding relationship-specific investments
in expertise, equipment, and research and development". Conversely, "the subcontractor must maintain its
reputation for quality, timely delivery of supplies, continual innovative effort, and so on, if it is to secure a
stable and profitable position in the subcontracting group".

auto-maker by more than offsetting the lower U.S. production costs for parts. Generally, higher
levels of investment reduce the range of imported parts, causing a fall in the U.S. share of the
Japanese auto-parts’ market. Since Japanese auto production also rises, the total value of U.S. parts
imports need not fall. However, for a sufficiently high level of investment, the reduction in the range
of imported parts dominates and eventually imports would be reduced to zero.
Even supposing this last worst case scenario for U.S. exports, it is not obvious that these
keiretsu supply relationships create an “unfair” trade barrier, potentially justifying the use of
countervailing trade remedies. A central issue is one of exclusive dealing: are U.S. and other nonJapanese suppliers unfairly excluded from long-term or other supply arrangements with the keiretsu?
We would argue that the simple exclusion of imports does not prove the case because the
informational requirements for the effective design of relationship-specific investments could require
a local presence in Japan and close communication with other keiretsu suppliers. For example,
detailed information about the production processes of other suppliers may be required to improve
the compatibility or fit of a particular part and close coordination with these suppliers may be
required for just in time delivery6. Also, if U.S. and other non-Japanese firms do locate in Japan,
language and other cultural barriers may make it difficult for these firms to be effective in creating
rents for the keiretsu auto-maker. In addition, since in our model relationship-specific investment
enhances efficiency, even if exclusionary, the long-term keiretsu arrangements could be defended
as a method to improve incentives for investment7.

6

Branstetter (2000) finds strong empirical support for the importance of the flow of technological
information within vertical keiretsu groups in enhancing efficiency. Also, the need to transport parts from
the U.S. would complicate “just in time” delivery. Further, exchange rate fluctuations could raise the risk
to U.S. firms in making investments that are specific to the Japanese buyer.
7

This argument has been made by Marvel (1982) in a general context.



Apart from these general comments, the paper does not provide further insight as to whether
keiretsu supply arrangements are in fact exclusionary practices. Rather, having developed the basic
effects of relationship-specific investment within keiretsu on the range and value of imported
intermediate goods, a central theme of the paper is then to argue that these relationships could create
a strong impression of the existence of an ‘unfair’ barrier to trade, even if the practices are not truly
exclusionary. First, if the rents created by the relationship-specific investment are not observable
outside the keiretsu, then the inability to export parts that are cheaper in the U.S. could appear to be
due to a trade barrier. Also, relationship-specific investment can lead to counterintuitive effects. For
example, a move from a prohibitive Japanese tariff to free trade or, alternatively, a reduction in the
price of U.S. parts could raise Japanese marginal cost, reducing Japanese auto output and total
demand for parts. Also, to the extent Japanese auto output increases, this tends to reduce the range
of parts that would be imported at free trade. We argue that these counterintuitive effects could easily
be misunderstood leading to significant perceptions of a trade barrier.
To develop these results, we take the existence of long-term supply arrangements involving
relationship-specific investments within keiretsu as given8. We also make the simplifying, but
generally realistic, assumption that suppliers exporting from the United States are unable to make
relationship-specific investments of value to the keiretsu auto-maker. As discussed above, we do not
need to specify whether this is due to the need to overcome cultural barriers and produce locally in
Japan or to some exclusionary practice. Indeed, our results concerning the implications for U.S.
8

Keiretsu are in fact very stable. For instance, “ member firms of Kyohokai, an association formed by
Toyota parts suppliers, numbered 171 in 1984. Of these firms, 153 had been continual members of Kyohokai
during the 11 years since 1973. During the same period, exits ...numbered only 3, whereas new entrants
numbered 21" (Asanuma 1989, p. 5). Also subcontractors differ as to whether they are top ranked firms with
technological expertise and long-term supply relationships or more marginal firms that may be used as a short
term capacity buffer so as to help maintain permanent employment in the core manufacturer (see Asanuma
1989, pp 16-18 and Aoki, 1988, pp 208-209). Our analysis applies to the top ranked suppliers.



exports to Japan do not depend on whether keiretsu firms are domestically or foreign owned.
Although not necessary for the results, an additional assumption is that U.S. parts suppliers do not
make relationship-specific investments of value to the U.S. auto maker9. Since contracts made by
U.S. auto makers with outside suppliers are relatively short term (reducing the profitability of
relationship-specific investments), whereas in Japan they are open ended, this simplifying
assumption partially reflects this institutional difference10. In the absence of relationship -specific
investment, parts, whether from Japan or the U.S., are priced competitively at marginal cost11.
While there is a large literature concerning vertical integration, contract design and the
institutional differences between Japanese and U.S. contracting arrangements12, specific modelling
of the informal procurement arrangements within keiretsu is relatively recent13. Of particular
relevance here is McLaren (1999), who argues that less formal bargaining arrangements can

9

The model could be developed with symmetric institutions, in which U.S. and Japanese suppliers make
relationship-specific investments of value to the U.S. and Japanese auto-makers respectively. The nature of
results concerning the range and value of U.S. parts imported into Japan would not change. However instead
of simply importing those parts that can be produced more cheaply in Japan, the results developed for
imports into Japan would now also apply to imports into the U.S.
10

The average length of contract in the U.S. auto industry was only 2.5 years in 1989, up from 1.3 years
in 1984 (Dyer and Ouchi 1993). Some theoretical justification for asymmetry is provided by McLaren
(1998), who argues that the ‘thickness of the market’ for specialized inputs produced by unintegrated firms
can lead to multiple equilibria in which countries differ as to the degree of vertical integration. Vertical
integration ‘thins’ the market, reducing the incentive for up-front production by unintegrated firms.
11

In 1992, 4856 establishments produced auto parts in the U.S. (source: Office of Automotive Affairs).
Although it is a stylized fact that U.S. auto producers are more vertically integrated than their Japanese
counterparts, treating U.S. suppliers as purely competitive is not unreasonable given the large number of
independent firms with relatively short-term contracts. However, one might want to relax this assumption
to allow for a rent-shifting motive if the aim were to model the political economy aspects of lobbying by the
U.S. auto industry for greater access to Japan.

See for example, Perry (1989), Aoki (1988), Asanuma (1985, 1989), and Holmstrom and Roberts (1998).

the American and Japanese subcontracting systems for quality control.

dominate formal contracts in encouraging cooperative investment14. More generally, well known
managerial costs arising from incentive problems within organizations can favor informal supply
arrangements of the sort exemplified by the keiretsu (see Aoki (1988)). Empirical work examining
the effects of keiretsu on the pattern of Japanese trade include Lawrence (1991, 1993) and Fung
(1991), who argue that industries with a high keiretsu presence tend to have low imports15. Of
particular relevance is the broader question as to whether the reduced level of imports is due to
exclusionary practices or simply the greater efficiency of keiretsu production. Lawrence (1991) finds
that there is some support for the idea that vertical, as opposed to horizontal, keiretsu enhance
efficiency. Also, Weinstein and Yafeh (1995) present evidence that strong relationships with their
main bank can cause keiretsu expansion at the expense of imports. Related theoretical work includes
Greaney (1999), Krishna and Morgan (1996) and Cheng and Kreinin (1996)16.
This paper provides a natural basis for further work concerning the effects of trade policy in
the context of the US/Japan trade dispute17. However, the model’s consideration of a large number
of parts, with differing importance for downstream costs, could also have applications in other
procurement settings. Since a higher share of downstream costs tends to make relationship-specific
14

In McLaren (1999), the availability of unintegrated buyers for an input raises the incentive for cooperative
investment, by raising the ‘threat point’ of suppliers in the event that bargaining breaks down.
15

Saxonhouse (1991) presents an opposing opinion, arguing that the methodology used by Lawrence (1991)
is flawed and that there is little evidence that Japan’s trade regime is different from other countries. Data to
be explained include Japan's low share of manufactured goods imports, low share of intra-industry trade,
etc (see Lawrence 1993, pp 6-7).
16

In Greaney (1999), distortion in output can occur if market share differences across countries are used
as evidence of an implicit trade barrier. Krishna and Morgan (1996) examine results-oriented policies in the
context of the U.S. - Japan auto parts dispute and Cheng and Kreinin (1996) argue that preferential use of
keiretsu suppliers increases the incidence of dumping in the U.S.. Also relevant is the literature concerned
with vertical relations between markets for trade policy (e.g. Spencer and Jones 1992) and for the vertical
structure of the industry, such as the use of production joint ventures (see Spencer and Raubitschek 1996).

Qiu and Spencer (1999) examine the effects of VIE’s and VER’s using the same approach.

investment more valuable for the downstream purchasing firm, this suggests that, even with different
contracting arrangements, parts with high-cost shares are more likely to be associated with long-term
supply arrangements or at the extreme, full vertical integration. In the current context, the model
predicts that such parts will be produced within the keiretsu and only lower value parts will be
imported. This has some real world counterpart, as shown by U.S. complaints that Japanese firms
preferentially reserve high value auto parts for their own suppliers18.
In Section 2, the model is developed in an initial closed market setting, with the effects of
moving to free trade presented in Section 3. Section 4 then develops the effects of relationshipspecific investments within keiretsu for the ability of foreign suppliers of intermediate goods to
access the Japanese market. Next, in Section 5, we explain why the use of imports could raise
Japanese marginal costs and also discuss the implications of this and other counterintuitive results
for perceptions of a trade barrier. Finally Section 6 contains concluding remarks.

2. THE MODEL OF RELATIONSHIP-SPECIFIC INVESTMENT
2.1. Costs and relationship-specific rents with general numbers of parts
We suppose that a final good, such as an auto is produced in both Japan and the United States
based on Cournot competition between a Japanese firm, referred to as a J-maker, and a U.S. firm,
referred to as an A-maker. Our results also apply to the case in which the J-maker has a world
monopoly, but the extension to oligopoly seems appropriate given the institutional reality of
oligopolistic competition between U.S. and Japanese auto producers. Autos are assumed
homogeneous (for convenience) and are sold in a unified world market at a price P = P(Y) where Y

 yJ + yA and yJ and yA are the respective outputs of the J and A makers.
18

See for example, Lachica (1995).



A large number N of parts is required to produce an auto, with parts and labor combined in
fixed proportion. Without loss of generality, we set the units of output of each part i so that each auto
is produced using just one part of each type. In modelling the keiretsu, a central role is played by the
fact that parts differ with respect to their costs of production and hence their importance for
downstream costs. The cost of production of parts also differs across the two countries. Letting ci
and c*i represent the constant average (and marginal) cost of production of part i in Japan and the
U.S. respectively, we arrange parts i in order of increasing average cost. This ordering is assumed
to be the same in both countries. Exploiting the fact that the number N of parts is large, it is
convenient to express costs ci and c*i as differentiable and increasing functions ci = c(i) and c*i = c(i)
on the continuum i  [0,N]. For the keiretsu parts producers, the importance of part i for
downstream costs is then captured by the cost- share19,

)i = )(i) = c(i)/C(N) for C(N)  ,0N cidi,
() is Greek s for share) where the ordering of parts implies )1(i) > 0.
As previously discussed, the U.S. parts producers act as purely competitive firms with no
commitment to the J or A makers. Within the keiretsu, we assume for simplicity that there is just one
J-supplier20 of each part i. Each J-supplier i (or more simply supplier i) potentially makes a
relationship-specific investment, denoted ki, which creates rent for the J-maker (but not for the A-

19

To see the correspondence between the discrete and continuous versions of the model, suppose that c(j)
= a + 'j for j = 1,2...N, which implies )j  c(j)/C(N) for C(N)  Nj=1 cj = N[a + ('/2)(N+1)]. If c(i) = c0

a + '/2, we obtain cj = ,jj-1 (c0 + 'i)di = co + '(j - 1/2) = ci and )j = )i. If c(j) is non-linear then )j  )i.
20

If there is more than one long term supplier for part i, this may weaken the ability of these supplier to
bargain over price. However, it is in the interest of the J-maker to allow suppliers some bargaining power
in order to gain the benefit from relationship-specific investments (see Proposition A1(ii) of Appendix A).
Provided some investment takes place, most of our results are not sensitive to the level of bargaining power.



maker) in the form of a reduction in assembly costs21. Since the J-maker gains rent only through the
use of the part, the level of rent, denoted ri, is assumed to be constant for each unit of part i
purchased from supplier i. Recalling that each auto is produced with just one unit of each part, ri also
represents the J-maker’s rent per auto from investment ki. The magnitude of ri is assumed to be
proportional to the initial value, denoted wo, of the J-maker’s assembly cost in the absence of
relationship-specific investments and also to the relative contribution of part i to cost, as measured
by the cost-share )(i).This last condition reflects the idea that the greater the proportion of costs
associated with the part, the greater the potential for cost reduction. For example, a given amount
of investment is likely to be more effective in reducing costs when it applies to engines rather than
to seat covers. Also, we obtain the reasonable feature that the level of rent created per auto is
invariant to an inflation in the costs of all parts. Finally, letting  denote the productivity of
investment in creating rent, the rent created per auto by investment ki is given by:
(2.1)

ri = wo)(i)h(ki) for 0 <   max,

where max  min[1, C(N)/wo] and h(ki) satisfies:
(2.2)

h(0) = 0, h1(ki) > 0, h2(ki) < 0 and h(ki) < 1.

Two examples of functions satisfying (2.2)22 are h(ki ) = 1 - exp{-ki} and h(ki) = 1 - 1/(1+ki).
From (2.1) and (2.2), it follows that rent, ri, is increasing in ki, but at a decreasing rate:
(2.3)

dri/dki = wo)(i)h1(ki) > 0 and d2ri/(dki)2 = wo)(i)h2(ki) < 0.

Also, the conditions   max and h(ki) < 1 sufficiently restrict the magnitude of the rent, ri ,that

21

From Dyer and Ouchi (1993, Fig. 2), in 1984, assembly costs were 23.1% of total costs for a U.S. car and
only 15.7% for a comparable Japanese car. Relationship-specific investments can reduce assembly costs by
improving the “fit” with other parts or by facilitating “just in time” delivery so as to reduce inventory costs.
If h(ki) = 1 - exp{-ki}, then h(0) = 0, h1(ki ) = exp{-ki}, h2(ki) = -h1(ki ) and h(ki) < 1. If h(ki) = 1 - 1/(1+ki),
then h(0) = 0, h1(ki) = 1/(1+ki)2, h2(ki) = -2/(1+ki)3, and h(ki) < 1.
22



there is no “free lunch” from assembly or from the production and use of keiretsu parts. Since ri <
wo)(i) from max  1, h(ki) < 1 and (2.1), the J-maker’s assembly cost per auto, denoted w, is strictly
positive: i.e.
w = wo - ,0N ri di = ,0N (wo )(i) - ri)di > 0.
Correspondingly, since ri < )iC(N) = ci from max  C(N)/wo , h(ki) < 1 and (2.1), the marginal
resource cost, ci-ri, from the production and use of keiretsu parts once investment ki has been sunk,
is also strictly positive.
Adjusting for relationship-specific investment and letting pi represent the price paid to
supplier i, the J-maker’s marginal cost for part i is given by

i

 pi - ri if the part is purchased from

within the keiretsu and by c*i if the part is imported. The J-maker’s overall marginal cost, denoted
J

, then equals the sum of these costs for parts plus w0. To focus on the question of access to the

Japanese market, we assume that parts can be freely imported into the U.S. from Japan and hence
that the A-maker buys part i at a price equal to the min [c*i, ci]. Thus, given a constant assembly cost,
the A-maker’s marginal cost, denoted

A

, is a constant. The J-maker, supplier i and the A-maker

respectively earn profits:
(2.4)

%J = yJ(P(Y) -

J

), 1i = yJ(pi - ci) - ki and %A = yA(P(Y) -

A

).

2.2. Order of moves and bargaining over price within the keiretsu
Relationship- specific investments within keiretsu take place at arms length. Consequently,
even if such investment would be beneficial to the J-maker, payment is typically determined only
after investment is sunk and there is no guarantee that the cost will be covered23. The model captures
this idea by assuming that J-suppliers commit to their investments prior to bargaining with the J-

As stated by Dyer and Ouchi (1993, p. 52), “Japanese suppliers frequently give automakers a head start
in development by starting work on projects even before they are assured of winning the project”.



maker as to the price they will receive for their product. Although the bargained price, pi, can depend
on the rent ri created by investment ki, it is assumed that third party verification problems24 prevent
payments based on ki directly. As outlined in the Appendix, it is possible to formulate a model of
incomplete contracts with the same results, but a bargaining framework would seem to best reflect
the institutional arrangements within keiretsu25.
We assume the following order of moves. In stage 1, each supplier i commits to its
investment ki, which becomes sunk at this stage, and simultaneously, the J-maker and A-maker both
specify their respective outputs yJ and yA. Since each firm sets its choice variable to maximize own
profit taking the other choice variables as given, this gives rise to a Nash equilibrium in ki, yJ and yA.
If the J-maker has a monopoly then yA  0. Profits %J and %A (in the duopoly case) are strictly
positive, but it is possible that a J-supplier would make a loss by producing in stage 2 (i.e. 1i < 0
for all ki  0) or that bargaining would break down and the supplier would not produce the part. In
both these cases, anticipating the outcome of stage 2, the profit maximizing response is for supplier
i to set ki = 0 and exit the market at stage 1. In stage 2, the J-maker engages in simultaneous Nash
bargaining26 over price pi with each supplier i remaining in the market. If an agreement is reached,
the J-maker orders its desired number of parts. Otherwise the J-maker purchases part i at the lowest
price available, either at a price ci from a competitive spot market in Japan or at a price c*i from U.S.
suppliers if imports are not prohibited. Parts and final-good output are then produced and sold.

24

It is possible that a judge would not be able to verify the value of ki, even if all parties can estimate the
value of ki from knowledge of ri, )i and . Adding uncertainty to the model would disguise the value of ki,
but although a suitably designed model would give similar results, the model becomes rather more complex.
25

The role of bargaining is supported by Asanuma (1985), who observes that parts prices are revised at
regular intervals, by bilateral negotiation, incorporating both risk and incentives for innovation and effort.
26

See Binmore, Rubinstein and Wolinsky (1986) for a justification of the Nash Bargaining concept as a
subgame perfect equilibrium in a game where participants alternate offers until one side accepts.



An alternative possibility27 would be to assume that investments ki are determined in stage
1 and yJ, yA and pi in stage 2. Suppliers would then strategically choose ki considering the effect on
the Cournot equilibrium outputs in stage 2 as well as the bargained price pi. However, since with a
continuum of parts it is reasonable to assume that the effect of an individual variation in ki on yJ is
negligible, the outcome is then the same as with the assumed order of moves.
We initially develop the model in a closed market setting in which the import of parts into
Japan is prevented through government regulations or a prohibitive tariff. Considering stage 2 first,
the J-maker’s objective in bargaining with supplier i is to minimize the total cost, yJ

i

= yJ(pi - ri),

of part i for the given output yJ committed in stage 1. Since the J-maker’s disagreement or “threat
point” is to buy the part at a price ci from the spot market, this implies a payoff from reaching
agreement of yJ(ci -

i

). Correspondingly, since ki is sunk, supplier i maximizes variable profit 1i

+ ki = yJ(pi - ci) with a threat point of no production and zero variable profit. Hence, setting pi to
maximize Gi  yJ(ci -

i

) (pi - ci)1- for   [0,1], where  represents the bargaining power of the

J-maker and 1 -  the bargaining power of each J-supplier, it follows28, using ci - ri > 0, that at the
Nash bargaining equilibrium:
(2.5)

pi - ci = (1 - )ri  0 and

i

 pi - ri = ci - ri > 0.

As can be seen from (2.5), supplier i gains a share, 1-, of the rent it creates, resulting in a reduction
of ri in the marginal cost of part i for the J-maker. Since the respective payoffs to the J-maker and
supplier i are non-negative for all ki  0, i.e.

27

This may be the more natural order of moves for the example in which relationship-specific investment
involves building a plant near the J-maker. However, if the investment involves small design changes to make
the part a better fit with other keiretsu parts, then the importance of knowing exact production requirements
may make the simultaneous choice of yJ with ki a more natural assumption.
28

From dlnGi/dpi = (1-)/(pi-ci) - /(ci- i) = 0, we obtain (pi-ci) = (1-)(ci- i) for

i

= pi-ri.



yJ(ci -

i

) = yJri  0 and 1i + ki = yJ(1 - )ri  0,

agreement is always reached for supplier i to produce the part. However, if ki = 0 then, since

i

= ci

from (2.5), the J-maker’s cost is the same as if the part had been purchased on the spot market.
2.3. Stage 1: relationship-specific investments and output decisions.
In stage 1, there is a Nash equilibrium in which the J and A makers set their outputs and Jsuppliers simultaneously set their investment levels. Examining the investment decisions first, if
supplier i remains to produce in stage 2, it sets ki  0 to maximize 1i as in (2.6), taking yJ , yA and
kj for j g i as given29. Since 1i is concave30 in ki, the Kuhn-Tucker first order conditions given by,

01i/0ki = yJ(1 - )(dri/dki) - 1  0 and (01i/0ki)ki = 0,

(2.7)

define ki as a function, ki = k()i,yJ), where ki satisfies 01i/0ki = 0 if ki > 0 and ki = 0 if 01i/0ki < 0.
Taking into account stage 2, from (2.6) evaluated at ki = k()i,yJ), supplier i earns a stage 1 profit
given by:

1i = 1()i,yJ) = yJ(1 - )ri - k()i,yJ) for ri = wo)ih(k()i,yJ)),

(2.8)

where the parameters  and  are omitted for convenience. Since, from (2.8), J-suppliers have the
option of earning 1i = 1()i,yJ) = 0 by setting ki = 0, all J-suppliers produce in stage 2 and from
(2.7), supplier i engages in relationship-specific investment, setting ki > 0, if and only if 01i/0ki >
0 at ki = 0.
Since a requirement for relationship-specific investment is that J-suppliers receive a positive
share of the rent they create (see (2.7)), we assume  < 1. Evaluating (2.7) at ki = 0, using dri/dki
from (2.3), the ordering of parts from lowest to highest cost-share then ensures that d(01i/0ki)/di =
yJ(1 - )wo)1(i)h1(0) > 0 and hence that ki > 0 implies kj > 0 for all j > i. Thus, letting part i = Z
29

30

From (2.6), yA and investments kj for j g i influence ki only through their effects on yJ.
We have from (2.6) that 021i/(0ki)2 = yJ(1 - )wo)(i)h2(ki) < 0.



(Z for zero investment) satisfy
kZ = 0 and 01Z/0kZ = yJ(1 - )wo)(Z)h1(0) - 1 = 0,

(2.9)

defines the cutoff point, Z = Z(yJ; ,), for investment with ki = k()i,yJ) > 0 if i > Z and ki = 0 for
i  Z. We assume that some suppliers set ki > 0, which implies Z < N. An important case is ki > 0
for all i  [0,N], which, for convenience, we refer to as satisfying i > Z. This case applies at  = max,
since we assume

010/0k0 = yJ(1 - )wo)0max h1(0) - 1 > 0,

(2.10)

which implies that k0 = k()0,yJ;max) > 0 and hence k()i,yJ;max) > 0 for all i  [0,N].
The conditions under which J-suppliers make relationship-specific investments are
summarized in Proposition 1(i). Also, as shown in Proposition 1(ii), the ordering of parts in terms
of increasing cost shares )i has the useful feature that for i > Z, parts are also ordered in terms of
increasing levels of ki, ri and 1i. Supposing that suppliers i and j for i > j make the same level of
investment, then since part i involves a higher cost share, this generates a higher level of rent for the
J-maker. Since the outcome of bargaining is that each supplier receives a share 1- of the rent
created, this translates into a higher return to supplier i from investment, with the result that supplier
i sets ki > kj.
Proposition 1: Assume parts cannot be imported into Japan.
(i) For i > Z, supplier i invests k i = k() i,y J) > 0, earns profit 1 i = 1() i,y J) > 0 and creates rent
r i > 0 per unit of the J-maker’s output. For i  Z, k i = k() i,y J) = 0 and 1 i = 1() i,y J) = 0.
(ii) For i > Z, higher cost-shares ) i are associated with greater levels of k i, r i and 1 i.
Proof: (i). We have ki = k()i,yJ) > 0 for i > Z and ki = 0 for i  Z from the text. For ki > 0, using yJ(1-

)wo)i = 1/h1(ki ) (from (2.7) and (2.3)) in (2.8) and h(ki)/ki > h1(ki) (from h(0) = 0 and h2(ki) <



0), we obtain

1i = 1()i,yJ) = [h(ki) - kih1(ki)]/h1(ki) > 0 for i > Z.

(2.11)

Also, ri > 0 for ki > 0 (since h(ki) > 0 from (2.2)). If ki = 0, then h(ki) = 0 implies ri = 0 and 1i = 0.
(ii). For i  Z, differentiating 01i/0ki = 0 as in (2.7) and using (2.3) and 021i/(0ki)2 = yJ(1 -

)wo)(i)h2(ki) < 0, we obtain 0ki/0)i = -h1(ki)/)ih2(ki) > 0. Letting i  - (h1(ki))2/h(ki)h2(ki)
where i > 0 from (2.2), it then follows from dri/d)i = woh(ki)[1 + )ih1(ki)(0ki/0)i)/h(ki)] > 0 and
(2.8) using 01i/0ki = 0 that
dri/d)i = ri(1+ i)/)i > 0 and d1i/d)i = yJ(1 - )ri/)i > 0 for i > Z.

(2.12)

Q.E.D.

Now considering the stage 1 determination of output, from the definition of Z and(2.5), the
J-maker’s marginal cost can be expressed as :
J

(2.13)

= ,0Z ci di + ,ZN (ci - ri)di + w0.

As (2.13) shows, if 0 <  < 1, the rent created by ki > 0 reduces the J-maker’s marginal cost below
the level

J

= C(N) + wo achieved either at  = 0, where J-suppliers capture all the rent created by

ki > 0, or at  = 1, where J-suppliers have no incentive to invest (ri = 0). It is also important to
recognize that, in setting its output at the Nash equilibrium in yJ , yA and ki, the J-maker treats ki and
hence

J

as fixed. Thus, there is no strategic role for output in influencing the prices paid for parts

at the second stage bargaining game.
From (2.4), using subscripts J and A to represent partial derivatives with respect to yJ and yA
respectively it follows that yJ and yA satisfy the standard Cournot first order conditions:
(2.14)

%JJ  0%J/0yJ = P + yJP1-

J

= 0 and %AA  0%A/0yA = P + yAP1-

Assuming that the following second order and stability conditions,

%JJJ = 2P1+ yJp2 < 0, %AAA = 2P1+ yAP2 < 0 and

A

= 0.

(yJ) is also dependent on yJ and

hence, for the comparative statics, we require the additional stability conditions:

%JJJ - d J/dyJ < 0 and H  Ho - %AAA(d J/dyJ) > 0.

(2.16)
From (2.14), holding
an increase in

J

J

fixed with respect to variations in yJ, we first obtain the standard result that

reduces yJ and we then use (2.16) to take account of the effect of yJ on

J

: i.e we

obtain:
dyJ/d

(2.17)

J

= %AAA/Ho < 0 and 1 - (dyJ/d J)(d J/dyJ) = H/Ho > 0.

If the J-maker has a monopoly, (2.17) reduces to
(2.18)

dyJ/d

J

= 1/%JJJ < 0 and 1 - (dyJ/d J)(d J/dyJ) = (%JJJ - d J/dyJ)/%JJJ > 0.

3. OPENING THE JAPANESE MARKET
With the removal of the government imposed trade restriction, there is free trade in the sense
that there are no laws restricting trade, but the extent to which parts are imported is affected by the
long-term supply arrangements within the keiretsu. This section develops the implications of free
trade for the bargaining model, relationship-specific investment and imports.
The potential for Japanese imports arises from the assumption that at least some range of
parts can be produced more cheaply in the U.S.. Letting

i

= (i)  c(i) - c*(i) represent the efficiency

gap between U.S. and Japanese production costs for part i, the simplest assumption is that c(i) and
c*(i) are linear in i with equal slopes leading to a constant efficiency gap across all parts: i.e. for all



i  [0,N],
i

(3.1)

=

= c(0) - c*(0)  0 due to c1(i) = c*1(i) and c2(i) = c*2(i) = 0.

= 0 is retained as a benchmark. However for greater generality and to better specify the

The case

range of parts for which relationship-specific investment causes keretsu production to displace
i

imports, we focus on the possibility that
due to

0

> 0 and part i = E, satisfying

E

differs across parts, with part i = 0 potentially imported

= 0 (E for equal costs), produced within the keiretsu. To

help ensure that there is only one region of imports (namely parts with low cost-shares), we make
the simplifying assumption31 that the efficiency gap is decreasing or constant as the cost-share rises,
and hence that
(0) > 0, (E) = 0 and 1(i)  0 for all i  [0,N].

(3.2)

If (N) < 0, then E < N and Japan has an actual cost advantage for parts with the highest costshares32. Finally, we focus on the case in which keiretsu investment is potentially relevant for imports
by assuming that Z  E. If Z  E, then all parts for which the U.S. has a cost advantage are
imported.
With respect to bargaining at stage 2, free trade gives the J-maker the additional option of
importing parts at prices c*i from U.S. producers. Using a superscript F to distinguish values at free
trade, for parts i  E where Japan has a cost advantage, the payoffs from agreement at the Nash
Bargaining equilibrium are unchanged from (2.6). Hence, as in Proposition 1, supplier i sets kiF =

For a unique region of imports, it is sufficient that J-supplier profits be strictly increasing in i for i 
[Z,N]. This tends to be an endogenous outcome of the model since profits increase due to rising levels of )i
and ki. This ordering is reinforced by 1(i)  0, but our results also apply if 1(i) > 0 and not too large.
31

32

For example, if there are three parts, with c(1) = $230, c(2) = $310 and c(3) = $390 in Japan, but c*(1)
= $200, c*(2) = $300 and c*(3) = $400 in the U.S., then (1) = $30, (2) = $10 and (3) = - $10. Since ci
is the total cost of part i required per auto, parts at the high end of the scale i  [0,N] could involve both high
cost parts produced in average volume or average cost parts produced in high volume.



k()i,yJ) > 0 and earns profits:

1iF = 1()i,yJ) = yJ(1 - )ri - k()i,yJ) > 0 for i  E > Z,

(3.3)

with kEF = k()E,yJ) = 0 and 1EF = 0 for Z = E. By contrast, in bargaining with supplier i for i < E, the
availability of lower cost imports changes the J-maker’s “threat point", with the consequence that33:
piF-ci = (1 - )(ri -

(3.4)

Comparing (3.4) with (2.5), since

iF

= c*i - ci > 0 for i < E, competition from imports reduces the

price paid the J-supplier by (1-) i, while the J-maker absorbs the amount,  i, of the efficiency
gap34. Analogously to (2.6), the respective payoffs of the J-maker and supplier i (relative to the
disagreement point) become:
yJ(c*i -

(3.5)

) = yJ(ri -

iF

i

) and 1iF + kiF = yJ(1 - )(ri -

) for i  E.

Agreement is then reached for supplier i to produce the part if and only the rent created is
sufficiently large to make ri -

i

 0. If ri -

i

< 0, then part i is imported . Hence, supplier i’s profit

at stage 2 is

1iF = yJ(1 - )(ri - i) - ki if ri -

(3.6)

i

 0 and 1iF = - ki if ri-

i

< 0.

Turning to stage 1, profit maximization by supplier i involves first, the optimal choice of ki
conditional on remaining to bargain with the J-maker and second, the decision whether to remain
in the market. With respect to the first choice, supplier i sets ki  0 to maximize 1iF as in (3.6),
taking yJ and yA as given. Since the potential for imports reduces the revenue to supplier i by an
amount (1-)yJ i, which is independent of the level of investment, this gives rise to the same first
order conditions for the choice of ki as before (see (2.7)), with the convenient result that the opening
of trade has no effect on the investment function, ki = k()i,yJ), for firms that remain as producers.



As for the decision whether to remain in the market, if supplier i produces the part, from (3.6) and
(2.8), it earns a stage 1 equilibrium profit given by:

1iF = 1F(i,yJ)  1()i,yJ) - yJ(1 - ) (i) for i  E.

(3.7)

Alternatively, if bargaining would break down (i.e. if ri positive (due to ri -

i

i

< 0) or if revenues from production are

 0), but are not sufficient to cover the sunk cost of investment, then supplier

i chooses not to invest, exiting the market at stage 1. Thus, noting that 1F(i,yJ)  0 implies that ri i

 0, supplier i remains to produce part i if and only if 1F(i,yJ)  0. Also, since ri -

i

 0 for

i

>

0 implies ki > 0, it follows all J-suppliers remaining to produce parts i < E must engage in
relationship-specific investment.
To specify the range of imported parts, letting i = T (T for trade) denote the marginal part just
produced by the keiretsu, then T  E satisfies
(3.8)

1F(T,yJ;,) = yJ(1 - )(rT - (T)) - k()T,yJ;) = 0,

which defines35 T = T(yJ;,) for yJ = yJ(

JF

). Proposition 2 describes the pattern of trade and

investment.
Proposition 2: Assume (i) satisfies (3.2). If Z = E, then T = E. If Z < E, then T satisfies Z < T < E
and supplier i produces part i, investing k i = k() i,y J) > 0 for i  T, including parts i for T  i < E
with (i) > 0. Parts i for i < T are imported, but no parts are imported if 1 F(0,y J)  0.
Proof: Since 1()i,yJ) = 0 at ki = 0, we obtain 1iF = -yJ(1 - ) (i) < 0 for i  Z and i < E from (3.7).
This implies that if Z = E, part i is imported for i < E and hence Z = T = E. If Z < E, then part i is
imported for i  Z and hence T > Z. Also, since d1iF/di = yJ(1 - )[ri)1(i)/)(i) - 1(i)] from (3.7)
and (2.12), we obtain:
This follows since 1F is increasing in i (see (3.9) below). Although yJ is determined endogenously,
expressing T = T(yJ) helps separate out the important relationship between imports and keiretsu output.
35



d1F(i,yJ)/di = yJ(1 - ))1(i)ri (1 + 3i)/)(i) > 0 for Z < i  E,

(3.9)

where 3i  -)(i) 1(i)/)1(i)ri > 0 if 1(i) < 0 and 3i = 0 if 1(i) = 0. Since T > Z for Z < E, it
follows, using (3.9), that kiF = k()i ,yJ) > 0 for i  T and parts are imported for i < T. Since 1F(E,yJ)
> 0 for kEF > 0, we also obtain T < E. If 1F(0,yJ)  0, then no parts are imported since 1F(i,yJ) > 0
for all i (see (3.9)).

Q.E.D.

Figure 1

As shown in Proposition 2, part i is produced by supplier i for i  T and is imported for i <
T. Consequently, imported parts represent the lowest value parts in the sense that they make the least
contribution to the cost of an auto. If 1F(0,yJ)  0 then no parts are imported. Also, in addition to the
parts i  E that can be produced more cheaply in Japan, relationship-specific investment leads Jsuppliers to produce a range of parts36 i  [T,E) for which the U.S. has lower production costs. As
illustrated in Figure 1, since T satisfies Z < T < E, all keiretsu suppliers remaining at free trade set
36

The assumption that (i) satisfies (3.2) ensures that part i = E exists and that i  [T, E) is not empty.



ki > 0, including the producer of the marginal part T. This investment creates rent, ri , for i  T,
which in the Figure is represented by the difference between c(i) and the dashed line, c(i) - r(i). For
Z < i < T, the difference between these lines is the rent that would have been created if the part had
been produced in the keiretsu. As the Figure shows, ri strictly exceeds the efficiency gap,

i

, for i

 [T,E). This is necessary if the J-suppliers are to cover the cost of their investment and, more
generally, is a reflection of the fact that parts with

i

> 0 are produced by the keiretsu only if this

raises efficiency37. Nevertheless, as we will subsequently argue, this failure to import the cheaper
U.S. parts can be significant if the rents are unobservable outside the keiretsu.
From Proposition 2, using (2.5) and (3.4), the J-maker’s marginal cost at free trade becomes:
JF

(3.10)

= ,0T c*idi + ,TE (c*i - (ri -

i

))di + ,EN (ci - ri)di + w0.

Consequently, at the stage 1 Nash equilibrium in yJ ,yA and ki , the outputs yJ = yJ(
yA(

JF

) and yA =

JF

) satisfy the same first order and stability conditions (2.14), (2.15) and (2.16) as before. Since

the opening of trade affects the J-maker’s marginal cost, comparisons with the pre-trade outcome
are complicated by endogenous changes in output. However it is useful to note that, holding output
yJ fixed, the opening of trade has no effect on the level of ki for parts that continue to be produced
in the keiretsu. Nevertheless since ki > 0 for parts i > Z before trade, the range of parts produced
with ki > 0 is reduced by the import of parts i  (Z,T).
Although both output and relationship-specific investment are endogenously determined in
the full model, it is useful to first explore the partial effects of an exogenous increase in the Jmaker’s output. As shown in Proposition 3, since an increase in yJ increases the incentives for
relationship-specific investment, leading more J-suppliers to stay in business, it also tends to reduce
For T  i < E, it follows from 1iF  0 and ki > 0 (see Proposition 2) that ri - i = c*i - (ci - ri) > 0 and hence
that the import cost, c*i, exceeds the marginal resource cost, ci - ri, of keiretsu production.
37



the range of imported parts. This requires that there be some imported parts (i.e. T > 0) and that Jsuppliers produce some parts for which the U.S. has a cost advantage (i.e. that Z < E and hence T
< E from proposition 2). For the case (3.1) in which the U.S. cost advantage is constant, we assume
that T  N. The endogenous choice of relationship-specific investment also creates economies of
scale for the J-maker. This last result requires that 0 <  < 1, since if  = 0 or if  = 1, then

i

min[c*i, ci] and marginal cost remains constant38.

Q.E.D.

Although it is not obvious what mechanism would ensure the credibility of a commitment to a particular
value of , there is no presumption that it is best to set  = 0 so as to fully internalize the returns from
investment to the J-suppliers. As shown in Proposition A1 of Appendix A, holding output fixed, total keiretsu
profit is maximized at  = 0. However, if output is allowed to vary, both the J-maker’s profit and aggregate
keiretsu profit are maximized at strictly positive values of .

4. ACCESS TO THE JAPANESE MARKET
This section concerns the implications of keiretsu relationship-specific investment for the
ability of foreign suppliers of intermediate goods to access the Japanese market.
Recalling that  represents the productivity of relationship-specific investment, an initial step
is to show in Proposition 4 that an increase in  expands both keiretsu output (i.e. dyJ/d > 0) and
the range of parts for which keiretsu firms potentially make investments (i.e. dZ/d < 0). Thus for

 sufficiently large, we move into the region Z < E in which some J-suppliers produce parts for
which the U.S. has a cost advantage. In this region, further increases in  restrict access to the
Japanese market by reducing the range of imported parts (i.e. dT/d < 0). More J-suppliers stay in
business because the increased rent produced by the investment raises both the price and volume of
each part sold to the J-maker. At the extreme, no parts are imported. Letting  = Z=E denote39 the
value of  at which Z = E, the range of imported parts falls if  > Z=E. Also, supposing that all Jsuppliers earn strictly positive profits40 at  = max, there exists41 a value of , denoted  = T=0, at
which T = 0. No parts are imported for   [T=0, max].
Proposition 4: (i) dy J/d > 0 for  > 0 (= 0 for  = 0), (ii) dZ/d < 0 for Z  0 and (iii) dT/d <
0 for 

( Z=E, T=0]. No parts are imported for 

[ T=0, max].

Proof: See Appendix B.
The effect of relationship-specific investment in reducing the range of imported parts has

From (2.9), we obtain Z=E  1/yJ(1-)wo)(E)h1(0) > 0.

We assume 1F(0,yJ;max) > 0 which implies that 1F(i,yJ;max) > 0 for all i  [0,N]. From (3.7), (2.11),(2.7)
and (2.3), we obtain 1F(0,yJ) = [h(k0) - k0h1(k0) - 0/wo)0]/h1(k0) and since k()0,yJ;max) > 0 from (2.10),
we have 1F(0,yJ;max) > 0 if 0/wo)0max is sufficiently small.
40

T=0 satisfies 1F(0,yJ;T=0) = 0 (see (3.8)). Since d1F(0,yJ( JF),)/d > 0, T=0 < max exists and is
unique. Since  = 1/yJ(1 - )w0)(i)h1(ki) from (2.7) and (2.7), using 1F(0,yJ) = 0, (3.7) and (2.11) for k0 >

significant consequences for a number of measures of access to the Japanese market. As shown in
Proposition 5, with fewer parts imported, the level of U.S. content per Japanese auto, denoted vAJ
= ,0Tc*idi, is reduced. Since the prices, piF, paid to keiretsu firms also increase, this implies a
reduction in the U.S. share, SAJ  vAJ/vJ for vJ  vAJ + ,TN piFdi, of the Japanese parts market. A
further and perhaps more direct indicator of the possible presence of a trade restriction is Sc = ,TE
c*idi /,0E c*idi, which represents the proportion of parts that are not imported, despite an efficiency
gap favoring the U.S.. Since Sc is increased, this measure also suggests that relationship-specific
investment limits access to the Japanese market.
Proposition 5: For 

(Z=E, T=0], an increase in :

(i) reduces U.S. content v AJ per Japanese auto,
(ii) reduces the U.S. share S AJ of the Japanese market for parts and
(iii) increases the proportion S cof parts that are not exported to Japan, despite a U.S. cost
advantage.
Proof: (i) Using dT/d < 0 from Proposition 4(iii), we obtain dvAJ/d = c*T(dT/d) < 0. (ii) Since
dpiF/d = (1 - )(dri/d) > 0 from (3.4) and (B1) and dT/d < 0, we obtain
dSAJ/d = [((vJ - vAJ)c*T + vAJpTF)(dT/d) - vAJ,TN(dpiF/d)di]/(vJ)2 < 0.
(iii) Using dT/d < 0, we obtain dSc/d = - c*T (dT/d)/,0E c*idi > 0.

Q.E.D.

The results in Proposition 5 all suggest that relationship-specific investment limits access to
the Japanese market. However, since this investment also increases the J-maker’s output, there is an
opposing effect due to an increase in the volume of imports for those parts that continue to be
imported. This opens the possibility that aggregate imports might rise. Summing over the range of
imported parts, since one of each part is required per auto, we can express the total volume, QAJ, and



value, VAJ, of parts imports as:
(4.1)

QAJ  T(yJ;)yJ and VAJ  vAJyJ where vAJ = ,0Tc*idi.

However, for the case (3.1) in which the efficiency gap,

i

= , is constant, Proposition 6 shows that

there exists a value of , denoted  = L (L for large), such that if  > L, then the reduction in the
range of imported parts from an increase in yJ dominates, causing both the volume, QAJ, and value,
VAJ ,of Japanese imports to fall. Eventually, at  = T=0, imports are reduced to zero. In addition,
since an increase in  preferentially reduces the imports of higher value parts, the value of U.S.
exports falls more than in proportion to the fall in the volume of U.S. exports. Nevertheless, since
it is possible that for low values of , an increase in  would raise both QAJ and VAJ, this undermines
any general claim that relationship-specific investment within the keiretsu is an impediment to trade.
Letting  = T=N denotes42 the value of  at which T = N, the condition   T=N ensures that at least
one part is produced by a J-supplier.
Proposition 6. Assume

i

=

as in (3.1). There exists some  L

[ T=N, T=0) such that for all 

(L,T=0], the total volume Q AJ and value V AJ of U.S. exports are reduced by (i) a small increase
in output, y J, OR (ii) an increase in . An increase in  reduces the value more than in proportion
to the volume of U.S. exports.
Proof: See Appendix B.
Figure 2 illustrates the effect of  on both the value, VAJ, and share, SAJ, of U.S. parts exports
to the Japanese market assuming that

i

> 0 for every part. All parts are imported for  < T=N, but

for   T=N, the range of imported parts falls (from Proposition 5(i)), reducing SAJ below one (as
measured on the right hand axis). The figure illustrates the case in which VAJ initially rises (due to
the increase in the J-maker’s output). However, as Proposition 6 shows, VAJ eventually falls for 

5. PERCEPTIONS OF A TRADE BARRIER
As previously mentioned, our result in Proposition 2 that a range of parts is produced by the
keiretsu when U.S. costs are lower can be explained by the presence of rents from relationshipspecific investment. Thus one might be tempted to dismiss it as simply due to incomplete
accounting. We would argue, however, that the result has considerable relevance when considering
the perceptions of a trade barrier that lie behind the U.S./Japan trade dispute concerning access to
the Japanese market. Since it seems reasonable to suppose that the rents created by relationshipspecific investments are, in fact, not observable outside the keiretsu, U.S. market participants and
other interested parties could easily fall into this accounting trap. For example, by complaining that
U.S. parts are not exported, despite prices that are less than half of made-in -Japan parts (see the
quote, footnote 2), Church (1995) may well be suffering from this misperception. In the remainder
of this section, we further develop the argument that relationship-specific investment can create



perceptions of a trade barrier, by first examining the behaviour of the J-maker’s marginal cost and
then considering effects arising from the size of the efficiency gap between the U.S. and Japan. As
we will show, some of these effects of investment can mimic a government imposed trade barrier
or simply create suspicion because they are counterintuitive and hard to understand.
Comparing (3.10) with (2.13), for a given output yJ, the effect of the opening of trade on the
J-maker’s marginal cost is given by:
(5.1)

JF

-

J

= - [,0Z idi + ,ZT (

i

- ri)di + ,TE (1 - ) idi].

Since parts i for i  Z involve no relationship-specific investment, they are all imported with the
opening of trade and, as can be seen from (5.1), the J-maker’s marginal cost for each part i falls by
i

. However, it is not necessary that parts be imported for marginal cost to fall. Parts i for i  [T,E)

continue to be produced by keiretsu suppliers, but marginal cost is reduced by

iF

-

i

= -(1 - )

i

due to potential competition from imports. Indeed, since there is no change in marginal cost for parts
i  E where Japan has a cost advantage, the J-maker’s overall marginal cost falls if imports remain
at zero with the removal of the trade restriction.
However, for parts i for i  (Z,T), which are produced with relationship-specific investment
prior to trade and are imported subsequently, it is possible that the J-maker’s marginal cost is
increased. The problem is that if the J-maker’s bargaining power, , is large, it can be unprofitable
for J-suppliers to invest, even though the rent created would exceed the efficiency gap by more than
the cost of the investment43. It is even possible that the opening of trade would raise the J-maker’s
overall marginal cost44. Recalling that prior to trade, marginal cost is

i

= ci - ri, the opening of

If  > 0, it is possible that 1iF < 0 (see (3.6), but that yJ(ri - i) - ki > 0.

This is an extreme example of the well known inefficiencies in ex ante investment incentives associated
with incomplete contracts (see for example, Laffont and Tirole (1993)).



trade raises the marginal cost of part i  (Z,T) if and only if45 c*i-

i

= -( i - ri) > 0. If all J-suppliers

set ki > 0 prior to the opening of trade, but subsequently all parts are imported (which requires
0 for all i), then the first and third terms of (5.1) vanish and since

follows that

This increase in cost requires that the J-maker’s bargaining power be relatively large. Greater
bargaining power has two opposing effects. It tends to reduce the J-maker’s marginal cost, by lowering the
bargained prices, piF, of parts for given levels of investment, but, it also causes J-suppliers to reduce their
relationship-specific investments, which reduces rents, making the suppliers more vulnerable to being
replaced by imports. Thus as  is increased, the opening of trade causes a greater shift towards the use of
imports, making it more likely that the loss of relationship-specific investment will cause the J-maker’s
marginal cost to rise. As Proposition A2 of Appendix A shows, even if  is set at the J-maker’s preferred
level, satisfying 0
possibility that

/0 = 0, we may have

Further insight into the effects of trade on the J-maker’s marginal cost is obtained by varying
the size of the efficiency gap. For simplicity, we assume
abstract from changes in

i

=

 c0-c*0  0 as in (3.1) and, to

A

, that the J-maker is a monopolist. Variation in

is achieved by varying

c*0 holding c0 fixed. Letting  = Z=0 denote the value of  at which Z = 0, we assume for
Proposition 7 that  > Z=0, and hence that all J-suppliers would set ki > 0 at

= 0 or, equivalently,

that all J-suppliers would invest in the presence of a prohibitive trade barrier. Letting

=

T=0

If c*i - i > 0, then since iF = i - (1-) i due to the threat of imports, keiretsu production of part i would
lower the J-maker’s marginal cost with or without trade (ie. iF < i < c*i). However, even if c*i - i < 0, it
is possible that iF < c*i < i and hence that keiretsu production of part i at free trade would lower J-maker
costs. From (3.5), this requires c*i - iF = (ri - i) > 0 which holds for i T, but which may also hold for
some parts i  (Z, T), which would be imported at free trade.

Proof: See Appendix B.
From standard models, one would expect that the removal of protection or a reduction in
import prices for intermediate goods would reduce domestic costs and that the associated increased
in domestic final-good production would raise intermediate-good imports. By contrast, we have
shown that relationship- specific investment can cause this line of reasoning to break down at two
places. First, it is possible that the J-maker’s cost is increased by the opening of trade (i.e.
> 0 and 0

JF

-

J

JF

/dc*0 < 0). Secondly, an increase in the J-maker’s output causes the range of

intermediate-good imports to fall, reducing the total value of these imports if  is sufficiently large.
In addition, given that the rents from relationship -specific investment are unobservable to potential
U.S. exporters, they might expect that parts for which the U.S. has a cost advantage, would all be
imported at free trade. However, from Proposition 7(i), it is possible that no parts are imported.
More generally, recalling the results of Propositions 2 and 6, a proportion SC of lower cost U.S. parts
would not be imported and the parts that are not imported are the “more important” parts involving
a larger share of production costs. The fact that these responses go against the conventional wisdom



and are not readily understandable from standard trade models, could easily give rise to negative
perceptions of a continuing trade barrier.
Supposing that U.S. suppliers form expectations of the J-maker’s demand for their products
based on Japanese pre-trade production levels and on conventional responses to the opening of trade,
under the first possibility of an increase in marginal cost, Japanese auto output and volume of
demand for imports would be lower than expected. However, since this first possibility occurs only
if the range of imported parts is “large”, driving out investment that would otherwise lower the Jmaker’s marginal cost, this makes significant perceptions of a trade barrier less likely47. By contrast,
in the more likely case that the opening of trade lowers the J-maker’s marginal cost, the response of
imports could create a particularly negative impression. Import levels are likely to be low relative
to keiretsu production, and for a small efficiency gap, i.e. for 0 <

T=0

<

, imports would remain

at zero. This mimics a government imposed trade barrier since a reduction in import prices for parts
or a move from protection to free trade in this region would not result in any imports. Also, the fact
that there are no imports despite an increase in the J-maker’s output (

JF

falls in this region), could

further strengthen the impression that the market is not really open. More generally, it would seem
highly suspicious if in response to a fall in U.S. costs, the J-maker’s output increases, but the range
of imported parts falls.
Finally, some analysis of welfare effects seems worthwhile. World welfare, denoted W, is
represented by the additively separable utility function, W = u(Y) + Z, where u(Y) is the utility from
final-good output, Y, and Z is the output of a tradable numeraire good produced under pure
competition by labor alone. Imposing the budget constraint that all income is spent, we obtain W 
However, since yJ falls, if  is not too high (see Proposition 6), U.S. suppliers might be suspicious that
the volume and value of their exports is somehow restricted.

0F  ,TN 1iF di = yJ(1-)[,TE (ri - i)di + ,EN ridi] - ,TN kidi.

(5.3)

From (5.3), using 01i/0ki = 0 for i  T, 1T = 0 and dyJ/d  0, we obtain:
d0F/d = (1-)[yJ( ,TN (ri /)di + ,TE (ri -

i

)di + ,EN ri di)(dyJ/d)] > 0.

For  = 0, since output yJ and hence yA , Y, %J and %A are unchanged (see Proposition 4), this effect
of  in raising 0F implies that relationship-specific investment raises Japanese and world welfare.
For  > 0, it follows using (B.4) and dyA/dyJ = -%AAJ/%AAA from (2.14) that
(5.4)

dyJ/d > 0, dyA/d = -%AAJ (0

/0)/H and dY/d = (p1/H)(0

JF

/0) > 0.

JF

As can be seen from (5.4), both yJ and Y increase, but if %AAJ < 0 (the strategic substitutes case), then
the A maker’s output, yA, falls. This can reduce world welfare, since if the A-maker is the lower cost
producer (i.e. if

JF

>

A

), the average cost of world production rises to the extent that J-maker’s

market share, yJ/Y is increased. Nevertheless, if the J-maker is the lower cost producer (i.e. if

JF



), we show in Proposition 8, that an increase in  increases both yJ/Y and world welfare48. This

result applies independently of whether yA and yJ are strategic substitutes or strategic complements.
Proposition 8: Assume  > Z=E. If

JF

and  > 0, then d(y J/Y)/d > 0 and dW/d > 0.

Proof: See Appendix B
With respect to Japanese welfare for  > 0, there is some ambiguity as to the sign of d%J/d,
but since %J rises if yA falls and 0F and Y both increase, Japan is certainly better off in the strategic
substitutes case. For the U.S., since d%A/d = yAp1(dyJ/d) < 0 for  > 0, it is a matter of weighing
a consumer gain against a loss by the A-maker. Examining this tradeoff, we let WA = u(YAC) - PYAC
+ %A denote U.S. welfare, where YAC is U.S. consumption. Since dWA/d = -YACp1(dY/d) +

48

This result is related to Fung (1998), who argues that, although U.S. exports may be hurt by the activities
of main banks in Japan, this can raise efficiency and world welfare.



yAp1(dyJ/d) (using (2.14)), this implies:
dWA/d = -YACp1(dyA/d) + (yA - YAC)p1(dyJ/d).
It follows that if U.S. production exceeds U.S. consumption (i.e. if yA >YAC) and if yA falls, then the
reduction in U.S. profits dominates causing WA to fall. However, WA rises for strategic complements
and yA  YAC.

6. CONCLUDING REMARKS
We have shown that the links between the J-maker and its suppliers due to relationshipspecific investment within the keiretsu reduce the range of imported parts, making it harder for U.S.
suppliers to access the Japanese market. Also, despite the associated increase in Japanese auto
production and demand for parts, a sufficiently high level of relationship-specific investment will
reduce the total value of parts imports from the U.S. and it is possible that no parts will be imported.
Although we do not address the issue of whether membership in the keiretsu is “unfairly”
exclusionary, since imports are driven out by the effect of relationship-specific investment in raising
keiretsu efficiency, our analysis suggests that long term supply arrangements within keiretsu could
be defended on the basis that they are efficiency enhancing.
However, even if imports are not ‘unfairly’ restricted, keiretsu supply relationships are likely
to give rise to a perception of an ‘unfair’ trade barrier. This is because the endogenous choice of
investment within keiretsu can lead to counterintuitive responses in the levels of keiretsu production
and imports, making it hard for outside observers to understand what is really happening. In
particular, the removal of a government ban on imported parts can actually raise Japanese production
costs, reducing Japanese auto output and total demand for parts. Also, if relationship-specific



investment is sufficiently productive, then imports will remain at zero with the opening of trade or
in response to a small reduction in U.S. costs at free trade, giving the appearance of a continuing
`unfair’ trade barrier. Strengthening this likely misperception is the fact that Japanese marginal costs
fall in this case, raising Japanese production of both autos and parts. As a final point, we hope that
recognition of these effects in the context of the policy debate concerning U.S./Japan trade issues
would create a better understanding by the parties involved, helping to ease trade tensions.

APPENDIX A
Formal Contracts as an Alternative to Bargaining:
The payment scheme for keiretsu suppliers obtained in our bargaining framework could also be
implemented through the use of contracts, signed in stage 0 before investment takes place. Assuming
relationship-specific investment ki is not verifyable by a third party and hence not contractible, but the rent
ri is contractible, the contract price can be represented as a linear sharing rule (see Laffont and Tirole (1993)):
(A1)

pi = ci + (1 - c)(ri - i) for i  E and pi = ci + (1 - c)ri for i  E,

where c and 1-c for c  [0,1] respectively represent the shares of the J-maker and supplier i in the net
cost reduction achieved by investment ki. By signing the contract, supplier i agrees to supply any quantity
of parts demanded at the price determined by (A1). As previously mentioned, uncertainty could be added so
as to disguise the value of ki , but this is not necessary and the model becomes rather more complex.
Although the same outcome is achieved under the contract and bargaining models if the same sharing
rule c =  is used, the difference in the institutional settings could affect which sharing rule is chosen. The
tradition in the procurement literature has been to choose the optimal contract from the viewpoint of the firm
issuing the contracts or, alternately, based on considerations of efficiency and consumer welfare in a
regulatory environment. Since the J-maker is responsible for purchasing inputs from a large number of
suppliers, this suggests that the choice of c in a contracting framework might involve maximization of the



J-maker’s profit. However, in our keiretsu bargaining context, a more natural objective might be to maximize
the aggregate profit of all keiretsu firms, including the J-suppliers. Despite these comments, it is not obvious
what mechanism that would ensure the credibility of a commitment to a specific value of , particularly in
the bargaining framework. Fortunately, apart from the possibility that the opening of trade would raise the
J-maker’s marginal cost, our results are generally robust to the value of .
The Sharing Rule and Profits within the Keiretsu:
Now considering the incentives for the choice of , we simplify the presentation by assuming the
J-maker is a monopolist and that all parts can be produced more cheaply in the U.S. (i.e.

i

> 0 for all i). For

purposes of comparison, we first set out the conditions determining the optimal choice of output and
investment if the keiretsu were fully vertically integrated and if investment ki were observable. From (2.4)
and (5.3), the aggregate profit, denoted $  %J + 0F, of the keirestsu can be expressed as:
(A2)

$ = yJ(P(yJ) - ) - ,TN ki di, where


JF

- (1 - ),TN (ri - i)di = ,0T c*idi + ,TN(ci - ri)di + w0,

represents the marginal cost of the integrated firm. Hence, maximizing $ from (A2), yJ and ki satisfy:
(A3)

d$/dyJ = P + yJP1 -

= 0 and

d$/dki = yJ(dri/dki) - 1 = 0 if i  T, where
yJ(ri - i) - ki  0 for i  T and yJ(ri - i) - ki < 0 for i < T.
Returning to the setting in which J- suppliers are independent and ki is not contractible, if yJ is chosen
to maximize aggregate keiretsu profit, $, taking ki as given, or, if the objective is to minimize total keiretsu
costs of production for a given level of output, then as shown in Proposition A1(i), we obtain the standard
result that returns to J-suppliers from investment should be fully internalized by setting  = 0. Investments
ki and output yJ are then at the same joint profit maximizing levels as in (A3). However, the inability to pay
suppliers in the form of fixed costs, based on actual levels of investment, means that the markups paid to Jsuppliers raise the J-maker’ marginal cost. Thus, from (A2) and (3.4),

JF

exceeds

by ,TN (pi - ci)di = (1 -

),TN (ri - i)di, creating a distortion from double marginalization. Consequently, output, yJ, is reduced below



the joint profit maximizing level when the J-maker maximizes %J as in our model. Since at  = 0 and at 
= 1,

JF

is at the maximum determined by the cost of importing all parts, this distortion can be partially offset

by setting  > 0 so as to reduce the J-maker’s marginal cost. The effect on J-supplier profit is ambiguous,
but, from Proposition A1(ii), a small increase in  above zero raises both %J and aggregate keiretsu profit,

$. More specifically, letting J and K represent the values of  that maximize %J and $ respectively, we
obtain 0 < K < J < 1, where

JF

is minimized at J.

Proposition A1: Assume the J-maker has a monopoly of the final-good,

i

> 0 for all i and T  N. If J-

suppliers choose ki to maximize 1i for a given level of yJ ,
(i)then, holding yJ fixed, or, if yJ maximizes $ for given ki, keiretsu profit $ is maximized at  = 0.
(ii)and, if yJ maximizes %J for given ki, we obtain 0 < K < J < 1, where  J satisfies 

/ = 0.

JF

Proof: Expressing T = T(yJ,) from (3.8), since 0T/0 = - (01FT/0)/(01FT/0T) for i = T  0, it then follows,
using (3.8), (3.9) and (2.7), that an increase in  increases the range of imported parts:
(A4)

0T/0 = )(T)(rT -

)/(1 - ))1(T)rT(1 + 3T) > 0 for T  0.

T

For i  T, from 01i/0ki = 0 as in (2.7) we obtain 0ki/0 = h1(ki)/(1 - )h2(ki) < 0 (see (2.2)) and hence:

0ri/0 = (dri/dki)(0ki/0) = -rii /(1 - ) < 0,

(A5)

for i  -(h1(ki))2/h(ki)h2(ki) > 0. Also, we can show from (3.10) and (A2) that:

/0 = - ,TN (ri - i)di + (0 /0),

JF

where 0 /0 = - [,TN (0ri /0)di - (rT -

= 0 for i  T and 1TF = 0 and, also, from (2.4), we obtain:
d0F/d = - [yJ - (1 - )(dyJ/d)](,TN (ri - i)di);

APPENDIX B
Proposition 4: (i) dy J/d > 0 for  > 0 (= 0 for  = 0), (ii) dZ/d < 0 for Z  0 and (iii) dT/d < 0 for 
( Z=E, T=0]. No parts are imported for 

[ T=0, max].

Proof:(i) For i  Z, from 01i/0ki = 0 as in (2.7), we obtain 0ki/0 = -h1(ki)/h2(ki) > 0 for a given yJ (see



(2.2)). Since 0ri/0 = wo)ih(ki)[1 + h1(ki)(0ki/0)/h(ki)], it then follows that:

0ri/0 = ri(1+i)/ > 0 for i  - (h1(ki))2/h(ki)h2(ki) > 0.

(B1)

Also, from (3.9) and 01TF/0 = yJ(1-)rT/ (from (3.8) using 01TF/0kT = 0 and 0ri/0 = ri/), we obtain

0T/0 = -)(T)/)1(T)(1 + 3T) < 0 for Z < E and T  0,

(B2)

where 3i > 0 if 1(i) < 0 and 3i = 0 if 1(i) = 0. For Z = E, then T = Z = E is constant. Next, from (3.10),
using (B1), (B2) and rT -

(ii) Assuming k0 = 0 and hence Z  0, it follows from (2.9) that dZ/dyJ = -)(Z)/yJ)1(Z) < 0 and 0Z/0 = -

)(Z)/)1(Z) < 0. Hence, using part (i), we obtain dZ/d = (0Z/0yJ)(dyJ/d) + 0Z/0 < 0 for Z  0.
(iii)Since Z = E at  = Z=E, it follows from part (ii) that Z < E for  > Z=E. Hence, using (B2), (B4) and
dT/dyJ < 0 from (3.11), we obtain dT/d = 0T/0 + (dT/dyJ)(dyJ/d) < 0 for   (Z=E , T=0]. Since imports
are zero at T = 0, no parts are imported for   [T=0, max].
Proposition 6. Assume

i

= as in (3.1). There exists some  L

Q.E.D.
[ T=N, T=0) such that for all 

(L,T=0],

the total volume Q AJ and value V AJ of U.S. exports are reduced by (i) a small increase in output, y J, OR (ii)
an increase in . An increase in  reduces the value more than in proportion to the volume of U.S. exports.
Proof: (i) For   [T=N ,T=0], we obtain dQAJ/dyJ = T + yJ(dT/dyJ) where T = T(yJ,) and, as we now show,
d(dQAJ/dyJ)/d = -( /rT)()T/)1(T))[(1/) + ( /rT)

(B5)

(dyJ/d)/yJ] < 0,

T

for T  - (h1(kT))2/h(kT)h2(kT) > 0. First note that d(dQAJ/dyJ)/d = 0(dQAJ/dyJ)/0 +(d2QAJ/(dyJ)2)(dyJ/d).
Since

i

= as in (3.1) implies 1(i) = 0 and )1(i) constant, we obtain 0T/0 = -)(T)/)1(T) from (B2) and

02T/(0)(0yJ) = -(dT/dyJ)/ where dT/dyJ = - ()T/)1(T))(1-( /rT))/yJ from (3.11). It then follows that
0(dQAJ/dyJ)/0 = 0T/0 + yJ(02T/(0yJ)(0)) = -( /rT)()T/)1(T))/ < 0.
From d2QAJ/(dyJ)2 = 2(dT/dyJ) + yJ(d2T/(dyJ)2) = ( /rT)[(dT/dyJ) - ()T/)1(T))(drT/dyJ)/rT] and drT/dyJ = rTT/yT



+ rT(1+T)()1(T)/)T)(dT/dyJ) (see (3.12) and (2.12)), gathering terms in dT/dyJ, we can show:
d2QAJ/(dyJ)2 = -( /rT)T [)T/)1(T)yJ + dT/dyJ] = -( /rT)2 ()T/)1(T))T/yJ < 0,
proving (B5). Next, since dT/dyJ < 0 from (3.11), we obtain dQAJ/dyJ = T + yJ(dT/dyJ) < 0 at  = T=0 (i.e.
at T = 0). Supposing dQAJ/dyJ > 0 at  = T=N, then, since d(dQAJ/dyJ)/d < 0 from (B5), there exists some

L  (T=N, T=0) for which dQAJ/dyJ = 0 at T = T(yJ,L) and hence dQAJ/dyJ < 0 for all   (L ,T=0]. If
dQAJ/dyJ  0 at  = T=N, then the result follows for L = T=N.
As for the value of U.S. parts exports, since dVAJ/dyJ = vAJ + yJc*T(dT/dyJ) from (4.1), we obtain:
dVAJ/dyJ = c*T(dQAJ/dyJ) + vAJ - Tc*T,

(B6)

where vAJ - Tc*T  0 (< 0 for T > 0) from dvAJ/dT = c*T > 0 and d2vAJ/(dT)2 = c*1(T) > 0. Hence from (B6),
using dQAJ/dyJ < 0, we obtain dVAJ/dyJ < 0 at T = T(yJ,) for all   (L, T=0].
(ii) Since dQAJ/d = (dQAJ/dyJ)(dyJ/d) + yJ(0T/0), using 0T/0 < 0 from (B2), dyJ/d  0 from (B4) and
dQAJ/dyJ  0 from part (i), we obtain dQAJ/d < 0 for   [L, T=0]. Similarly, since dVAJ/d =
(dVAJ/dyJ)(dyJ/d) + yJ(0vAJ/0), it follows using (B6), 0vAJ/0 = c*T(0T/0) and vAJ -Tc*T  0 that dVAJ/d
= c*T(dQAJ/d) + (vAJ - Tc*T)(dyJ/d) < 0 for   [L, T=0]. Dividing byVAJ, we then obtain:
(dVAJ/d)/VAJ = T(c*T/vAJ)(dQAJ/d)/QAJ + (vAJ - Tc*T)(dyJ/d)/VAJ.
Since Tc*T/vAJ > 1 for T > 0, it follows that (dVAJ/d)/VAJ < (dQAJ/d)/QAJ < 0 for all   [L, T=0).

Although 01iF/0c*0 >0 holding yJ fixed, if an increase in c*0 (fall in ) reduces yJ, 1iF may fall causing
