    "abstract": "\n\nWe investigate the role of training in reducing the gender wage gap using the UK-BHPS. Based on a lifecycle model and using tax and welfare bene\ufb01t reforms as a source of exogenous variation we evaluate the role of formal training and experience in de\ufb01ning the evolution of wages and employment careers, conditional on education. Training is potentially important in compensating for the e\ufb00ects of children, especially for women who left education after completing high school, but does not fundamentally change the wage gap resulting from labor market interruptions following child birth.\n\n",
