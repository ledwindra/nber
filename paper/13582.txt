                                             ABSTRACT

Whereas there is widespread belief that workers in temporary help services (THS) are subject to poorer
working conditions, in particular pay, than comparable workers in the rest of the economy, there is
little evidence on whether that is driven by the sector per se or by the workers’ characteristics. The
first aim of this analysis is to quantify the wage penalty, if any, for workers in THS firms. Secondly,
we analyze the wage profile of workers right before and after spells of THS. Linked employer-employee
data for Portugal enable us to account for observable as well as unobservable worker quality. Our results
show that workers in THS firms earn lower wages than their peers and that this difference is mostly
due to the workers’ characteristics. We estimate that workers in THS firms earn on average 9% less
than comparable workers in the rest of the economy if we control for the workers’ observable attributes
only. This difference is reduced to about 1% when we control for unobservable characteristics as well.
However, interesting differences emerge across groups. Younger workers, both men and women, earn
higher wages in TAW than their peers in other firms, while the opposite holds for prime-age and older
workers. Moreover, for young workers THS firms is not associated with a stigma effect that slows
their wage progression after they work for THS, as opposed to prime-age and older workers, in particular
males. Also before entering THS the wage trends are different. Prime-age and older workers, both
male and female, see their wages deteriorate relative to their peers before entering THS, suggesting
that adverse labor market conditions may motivate them to search for a THS job. On the contrary,
for young workers we do not detect any pre-THS wage trend.

1 Introduction
     There is much anecdotal evidence of poor working conditions in agency


     work, but much less hard evidence. None of the research referred to


     can dierentiate between factors related to agency work     per se   (as


     a form of employment) and those related to the job or the worker.


     (Storrie, 2002, p56)



   Employment in temporary help service (THS) rms has increased through-


out Europe over the last decade. This development has prompted the European


Commission to propose a directive to safeguard THS workers' working conditions.


In 2002 it issued a proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on


working conditions for THS workers (EIRO, 2002; European Commission, 2002),


which aims to ensure that temporary workers are not discriminated against, re-


ceiving at least as favorable a treatment as a regular comparable worker in the


rm where (s)he is posted. The relevant dimensions are the basic working and


employment conditions, including duration of working time, rest and holiday


periods, time of work, and seniority.


   This concern comes from widespread evidence that workers in THS rms


face worse working conditions than comparable workers in the placement rm.


Evidence in Houseman (2001) suggests that THS may be used to save on worker


benet costs, such as health insurance and pension contributions. These concerns


extend to wage rates as there seems to be evidence of lower wages for THS workers.


   Concern about workers in THS has also focused on whether they remain in


low-paying, dead-end jobs or if they nd, should they so desire, employment in


a standard working career. High turnover involves a loss of rm-specic human


capital, a decrease in productivity if production depends on continuous cooper-



                                        1
ation of workers, and possibly less coverage by trade unions, factors that may


contribute to poorer career prospects.   On the contrary, THS could serve as a


screening method (Autor, 2001; Houseman, 2001) at little cost for the rm, i.e.


without a commitment about a future employment contract.        Since THS work


matches a worker typically with several rms, it can be seen as a job matching


mechanism.


   The discussion has thus concentrated on whether or not workers in THS em-


ployment earn lower wages and whether or not THS employment enables workers


to start a better career. There are numerous studies for the US that nd that THS


workers receive lower wages than other workers, e.g., Segal and Sullivan (1997)


who report an average wage dierence of about 28% which is reduced to about


three percent when observable and time-invariant unobservable characteristics


are considered. (See also, amongst others, Blank (1998) or Nollen (1996).)


   Workers may accept lower wages in THS rms because the employment in


these rms allows a subsequent job match with better pay or more stable careers.


Autor and Houseman (2005), using random placement assignments, do not nd


that THS work is associated with stable careers in post-THS employment. For


welfare recipients, however, Heinrich, Mueser and Troske (2005) nd that work


in THS is associated with better outcomes than not working at all.


   The evidence for European countries is mixed. For example, Forde and Slater


(2005) report a wage penalty of about 11 percent for men and 6 percent for


women in THS in contrast to comparable workers in the UK. Zijl, van den Berg


and Heyma (2004) nd for the Netherlands that THS work is associated with


subsequent stable employment spells.     Similarly, Amuedo-Dorantes, Malo and


Muñoz-Bullón (2006), for Spain, Booth, Francesconi and Frank (2002), for the


UK, and Ichino, Mealli and Nannicini (2006), for Italy, nd that THS work is



                                         2
associated with subsequent stable employment. However, Kvasnicka (2005) nds


for Germany that THS work does not improve the subsequent careers of such


workers, and Antoni and Jahn (2006) nd that THS workers in Germany are


increasingly found in repeated spells of THS work.


   We use linked employer-employee data, obtained from the Ministry of Em-


ployment in Portugal, to analyze wages of workers in THS. These administrative


data cover the universe of Portuguese workers in the private sector for the period


1995-2000. The panel dimension of these data allow us to control for worker and


industry specic eects.


   The purpose of the paper is twofold. We analyze, rst of all, if THS workers


earn lower wages than comparable workers in other sectors by estimating wage


regressions.   Because participation in THS work is not random, we control for


workers' xed-eects in our estimations, taking advantage of the longitudinal


nature of the data. We perform the analysis separately for men and women as


well as for younger and older workers, since these groups tend to fare dierently in


the labor market. (We also perform the analyzes on the pooled sample.) Secondly,


we analyze workers wages before and after spells of THS. On the one hand, we


want to assess if THS work leads to lower wages in subsequent employment, i.e


evidence of a stigma eect. On the other hand, we want to investigate if workers


experienced a particular wage development before entering THS. For example,


their wages could be deteriorating relative to similar workers, in which case the


adverse labor market conditions would provide the motivation to search for a


THS job.


   Our empirical results suggest that THS workers earn about one per cent less


than similar workers in other rms, once their observable and unobservable at-


tributes are controlled for.   However, disaggregation of the sample by age and



                                         3
gender reveals interesting dierences across groups of workers. Younger workers,


both men and women, earn higher wages in THS rms than their peers in other


rms.   Prime-age workers, in particular men, earn a lower wage in THS rms


than similar workers in other rms. Also interestingly, for young workers, THS is


not associated with a stigma that slows their wage progression after they start to


work in the THS sector. In contrast, for prime-age and older workers, in particu-


lar males, wage progression after entering THS is slower than for similar workers


not engaged in THS. Before entering THS rms, prime-age workers, both men


and women, see their wages deteriorate relative to their peers, suggesting that


adverse labor market conditions might motivate them to search for a THS job.


For young workers, we do not detect any pre-THS wage trend.




2 Background

2.1     The association between THS work and wages


The distinguishing feature of work for a THS rm is the tripartite nature of the


relationship and the commercial nature of the contract signed between the THS


rm and the placement rm, which sets it apart from a traditional labor contract


between a worker and a rm. Even though a particular assignment of a worker


is temporary, it is not the duration of the contract that characterizes this sector.


   While there is widespread belief that THS workers earn lower wages than com-


parable workers, in particular in countries where labor legislation is not stringent


or trade union coverage is low, there are also reasons, and evidence, that point


to the opposite direction. THS workers may earn a higher wage that would com-


pensate for the risk of a more variable income stream than comparable workers.


It is also sometimes stressed that THS rms have diculty recruiting workers


                                         4
and need to oer favorable conditions to attract them.         Storrie (2002) reports


that at the the upper end of the pay scale, for instance in the health sector, THS


workers seem to enjoy better pay and possibly better working conditions than


regular workers. The wages in THS rms is thus an empirical issue which we will


address in more detail below.


      Some THS rms may choose to oer free general training instead of higher


wages to attract more workers and to identify better quality workers (Autor,


2001). In general, the need to attract workers and the existence of economies of


scale in the provision of some types of training have been pointed out as reasons


why THS rms may provide more training than legally required. Such training


could result in higher wages in post-THS employment.


      On the contrary, Storrie (2002) reports evidence of circumvention of employ-


ment standards for THS workers, especially in terms of pay and working time


regulations, and also evidence of other, illegal abuse.       The short employment


spells, possibly combined with low investment in human capital, and fewer work-


ers' rights due to lower coverage by trade unions are typically factors that char-


acterize poor career prospects.




2.2      Legal setting in Portugal


                                                          1
The market for THS is tightly regulated in Portugal.          Permission to operate


as a THS rm is granted by the Ministry of Employment and Social Security.


Candidates must show proof of a clean criminal record, previous compliance with


labor law and tax and social security duties, technical capacity (i.e., a qualied


director with experience of running human resources and supporting administra-

  1   Decree-Law 358/89, Law 39/96, and Law 146/99.

                                            5
                                                      2
tive sta ), as well as a sound nancial situation.       THS rms are allowed a wide


range of activities, which include recruitment and selection of personnel, voca-


tional orientation, training, consulting and human resources management. The


operation of the rm is regularly monitored by the Bureau of Labor Inspection


and it must present records of workers hired out to using rms every six months.


      The work contract is signed between the THS rm and the worker. The formal


employer is thus the THS, and not the user rm, and it is responsible in partic-


ular for paying the workers, fullling the employer's Social Security obligations,


providing insurance against work-related accidents, and allocating a minimum


of 1% of the total turnover to training. (The THS rm is legally forbidden to


charge the worker for training provided.) The user rm is responsible for fullling


regulations on health and security at the workplace.


      The work contract between the worker and the THS can be open-ended or


of limited duration. If open-ended, the worker is entitled to pay, even in periods


when (s)he is not actually assigned to a using rm. The amount is specied by


collective bargaining or, if the worker is not covered, two thirds of the national


minimum wage.


      Firms have to justify the need for temporary workers and a narrow set of


reasons is permitted: to replace workers on leave; for seasonal work; in case of


a temporary increase in product demand; to bridge recruitment gaps, while the


process to ll a vacancy is taking place.


      The contract between the THS rm and the using rm must also specify,


among other things, the duration of the assignment (which depends on the reason


for use of temporary work, with a maximum limit of six months to two years),

  2  A fund linked to the national minimum wage must be deposited, or a bank or insurance
company guarantee presented, which is used for wage payments if the company does not pay
its workers.

                                           6
the description of tasks to be performed, the wage the using rm pays its workers


who perform similar tasks, and the amount paid to the THS rm. A THS worker


is entitled to the wage set by collective bargaining for THS work or the wage paid


by the user rm to similar workers, whichever is higher. Because these rules aim


at providing equal treatment for regular and THS workers, we would expect to


see no, or a moderate, pay dierential between THS and regular workers. Over


90% of the THS workers are covered by a collective bargaining contract, signed

                                                            3
between trade unions and employer representatives.


       The regulations are monitored and enforced by the Bureau of Labor Inspec-


tion. However, situations of non-compliance with the law are frequently discussed


in the press, where THS owners associations demand stricter controls by the Bu-


reau, arguing that law-obeying rms are subject to unfair competition by rms


that do not fulll the law, especially the payment of taxes and Social Security


contributions. Trade unions, on the other hand, claim that workers' rights are


not always respected and also demand stricter monitoring. Finally, the Bureau of


Labor Inspection claims that the rms in the sector are subject to close scrutiny


and argues for higher legal sanctions to increase compliance.


       Although the legalization and regulation of this type of work took place rel-


atively early in comparison to other European countries, the use of THS is not


as widespread in Portugal as in other European countries. In 1999, it comprised


about 1% of total employment, below the European Union average of about 1.4%.


In terms of growth, although employment in the sector more than doubled be-


tween 1995 and 1999, its growth has been modest when compared to most other


European countries (Storrie, 2002, p23).

   3In Portugal, a contract signed between workers' and employers' representatives is often
extended to the all workers in a sector or rm, irrespective of their union membership status.

3 Data
The study is based on linked employer-employee data collected annually by the


Ministry of Employment in Portugal. The data cover all rms with wage-earners


in manufacturing and services in the private sector; because data provision is com-


pulsory only for companies with wage-earners, the coverage of the agricultural


sector is low. Public administration and domestic work are not covered. Reported


data include the rm's industry, location, employment, ownership (foreign, pri-


vate or public) and sales, and the worker's gender, age, occupation, schooling,


date of admission into the company, monthly earnings, and duration of work. We


use data from 1995 to 2000 since identication of THS work was not possible for


earlier years.


       The Portuguese Classication of Industries reports, under code 74500, rms

                                                         4
in labor recruitment and provision of personnel.           This is the denition we use

                                                                   5
to identify temporary help service rms and their workers.             Given the relevance


of the distinction between stocks and ows for this activity (with high worker


turnover), it should be stressed that the data refer to the stock of workers at a

                                           6
reference week in October each year.           Wage-earners aged 16 to 65 years were


selected for analysis.    We consider only the worker's main job, dened as the


job where the most hours were worked per month. Extensive checks have been


performed to guarantee the accuracy of the data, using gender, date of birth,


highest educational level and starting date in a company (details on the proce-


dures followed to clean the panel can be found in Cardoso (2005).)

   4 This classication follows closely NACE, the Classication of Economic Activities in the
European Community. Before 1995, a dierent industry classication, which did not assign a
specic code to this activity, was used.
   5 This denition has the disadvantage that we cannot distinguish between managers and
clerical sta that operate the THS and the workers who are hired out to using rms.
   6 Because of the timing of observations, we do not analyze the job tenure with THS rms
because not all jobs of short duration are captured in the data.
                                               8
   The administrative nature of the data and the legal requirement for the rm


to post the data in a space public to its workers contribute to its reliability.


Workers are identied by a personal identier, based on a transformation of the


social security number, and it is thus possible to track them over time, as long


as they work in the private sector.   If they are missing from the database, the


workers could be, among other situations, unemployed, inactive, employed in the


public administration or self-employed without dependent workers and we cannot


ascertain the employment status.


   In the analyzes that follow, we will keep the whole population of workers


who ever had a THS job, while limiting the data on workers who never had a


THS job to a 10% sample, so as to keep computations manageable.         For each


worker sampled, all the available observations on his/her work history were kept


for analysis. We report results on the overall sample, as well as separately for


women and men of 16 to 25 years of age and for women and men of 26 to 65


years of age.


   Gross hourly wages were computed and they were deated using the Consumer


Price Index (with the year 2000 as the base period). Wage outliers, i.e., hourly


wages of less than half the rst percentile or above 20 times percentile 99, have


been dropped from the analysis.




4 Descriptive evidence on the labor force of THS
     rms and their career prospects
The number of rms and workers in the THS sector increased from 1995 to 2000


and we observe a rising share in overall employment, from 0.5% to 1%. (These


gures are a lower bound on the overall number of THS workers as short spells are



                                        9
underrepresented because of how the data are collected.) The number of rms,


although increasing in absolute numbers, had a share of about 0.1% of all rms


in the private sector. (A tabulation of the development over time is given in the


Appendix, Table A.1.)


   Table 1 provides the descriptive statistics of our estimating sample, by THS


status.   On average, THS workers had a wage lower than other workers, with


a mean hourly wage dierence of about 23%.        We also see that the dispersion


of wages is lower for THS workers, a nding also evident in Figure 1 where we


plot the two wage distributions, pooling the observations from the six years. The


graph shows that the distribution of wages for THS workers is more concentrated,


with a higher peak and a thinner upper tail.


   [Table 1 near here.]


   [Figure 1 near here.]


   We observe a similar percentage of women in THS rms as in other rms in


the private sector (about 42%). THS workers are on average four years younger


than workers in the rest of the private sector, who are on average 36 years old.


THS workers are on average slightly better educated than other workers (about


50% of THS workers have 6 school years or less, compared to 61% in other


sectors; nevertheless, there are fewer workers with a higher education diploma


in THS rms than in other rms, i.e. four vs six percent). There are also more


low-skilled and administrative workers in THS than in other rms. We see that


workers in THS have short tenures with their rms, with 68% of THS workers


having tenures of less than one year; in contrast, for all other workers the fraction


of workers who have tenures of less than one year is 18%. The incidence of part-


time is higher in THS rms than in the rest of the economy (25% vs 9%).




                                         10
       THS rms are concentrated in the Lisbon region (78%, as opposed to 42% for

                           7
the remaining sectors).


       For 2000 only, data on the type of contract are available, indicating that 74%


of THS workers have a xed-term contract, which compares to 15% of the workers


in the rest of the private sector.




5 Lower pay in THS rms?
The comparison of mean wages points to a substantial and signicant wage dier-


ence between THS and regular workers, despite the stringent legal requirements.


In this section, we investigate in more detail if such wage dierences are still


evident once we control for the rm and worker characteristics.


       Table 2 reports the estimated coecients (and robust standard errors) of wage


regressions where we estimate the hourly wages of workers in the private sector.


We use several empirical specications for men and women who are 16 to 25


years of age and for men and women of ages 26 to 65.                   (The full estimation


results are provided in the Appendix, where we also report estimation results for


the complete sample.)


       Specication 1 controls for location of the rm and age and education of the


workers (and indicators for the year of observation). Specication 2 controls in


addition for the workers' occupation, which is one of the following categories: se-


nior managers, professionals or scientists; junior managers; administrative work-

   7 The agencies in Lisbon have on average a larger volume of business than companies in the
rest of the economy and the share of the market held by the ve largest rms, either in terms of
employment or sales volume, has remain stable at about 33% (not shown in the Table). These
gures are consistent with those reported in Storrie (2002) and they show Portugal as one of
the countries where THS is least concentrated in Europe; only the UK and Germany have a
lower market concentration.

                                              11
ers; service and sales workers; farmers; skilled workers and craftsmen; machine


operators, assembly workers; unskilled workers.


       Because workers do not randomly choose to work for a THS rm, any observed


wage dierence between THS and other workers may be caused by personal char-


acteristics not observed by us. We therefore estimate wage regressions where we

                                                                                        8
control for worker unobservable quality by introducing worker xed eects.                  The


estimated coecients from these estimations are presented in Columns 3 and 4


of Table 2, where specication 3 (specication 4) has the same set of controls as


specication 1 (specication 2).


       [Table 2 near here.]


       The estimations show that younger women who work for a THS rm receive


a higher wage than women who work for other rms. This is supported both by


the OLS and the xed-eects regressions. We estimate that they receive a wage


which is about four to ve percent higher than similar workers in other rms. For


younger men, the results are not as pronounced as for young women, as young


men earn on average a wage that is about one to two percent higher in THS


rms than in other rms. All these estimated wage dierences are statistically


signicant at an error level of ve percent, or less.


       According to the OLS estimates, older women who work in THS rms earn


about 12 percent less than similar women who work for other rms. This dier-


ences is dramatically reduced when we control for unobserved characteristics in


the xed-eects estimates. The results from the xed-eects estimates point to a


lower wage at around 1 percent, or less. For prime-age male workers, however, we


obtain coecients that indicate a much more severe dierence between working

   8Identication in this regressions of the impact of education on wages is feasible given that
a share of the workforce is observed changing increasing its education level. These shares
are 2%, 2%, 2%, and 1%, respectively for workers initially observed with 4, 6, 9, and 12 years
of education.
                                              12
for THS and other rms. We estimate, controlling for xed characteristics, that


these workers earn a wage which is about ve percent lower than similar workers


(if not controlling for the worker unobservable quality, that penalty would be


between 16 and 23 percent).




6 Wages before and after working in THS rms
We proceed placing the spells of THS employment in the context of the workers'


careers.   The wages of those workers who chose to work for a THS rm could


have been deteriorating relative to similar workers prior to entering a THS rm.


This relative wage loss could have been their motivation to start a THS job. A


second issue concerns the workers' careers once they start working for a THS


rm and their wage progression thereafter. Two dierent hypotheses on the wage


development upon entering the sector may be formulated. THS rms typically


place workers in several rms and this improves their position to nding a good


job match, possibly leading to being formally hired by a rm that already hired


them through the THS rm. As such, a worker would have already accumulated


some rm-specic human capital and we then expect the worker to have a com-


parable, if not faster, wage progression than other workers on leaving the THS


rm. Alternatively, working for a THS might be interpreted as a signal of lower


ability by employers and would result in fewer and/or worse job oers than other


workers would receive. This kind of mechanism would lead to poorer employment


prospects for former THS workers and their wages would be lower than those of


otherwise similar workers.


   In the vein of Segal and Sullivan (1998) and Jacobson, LaLonde and Sullivan


(1993), we construct a set of dummy variables to capture the number of years




                                      13
before or after the start of the THS spell. For each worker, the dummy variable


Dtk    is 1 if the worker at time    t   is   k   years away from the start of the THS spell.


Because our data cover 6 years, we have allowed              k to range between -2 and 2, with
a negative (positive)   k indicating the time before (after) the start of a spell of THS
employment. If the worker works for an THS rm at time t, the dummy variable


Dt0    is equivalent to a dummy variable on THS work, similar to the one used in

                              9
the specications above.          We report results including controls for location, age,


education and worker xed eects, and the year of observation (with and without


occupation included). For this part of the analysis, we dropped workers who had


more than one spell of THS, which led to an exclusion of seven percent of workers


who ever had a THS spell.


       Table 3 reports the estimated coecients for the indicator variables that con-


trol for employment episodes before and after the start of the THS spell. Focusing


on the estimated coecient on THS, the estimations conrm the previous results,


i.e., young workers earn a higher wage in agencies than their peers. In contrast,


older workers earn lower wages in THS rms than in other rms, with the dier-


ence being smaller for women than for men.


       [Table 3 near here.]


       Before entering THS, we observe that there are no dierences in terms of


wages for young workers between those who started to work in for a THS rm


and those who did not. The motivation to enter THS seems to be dierent for


younger than for older workers, because we estimate that older workers, both


men and women, see their wages deteriorate relative to similar workers before

   9We have also used dummy variables for the post-THS wages that indicate the time since
the end of the THS employment. However, since most THS spells are of a short duration,
the interpretation of our ndings change little. These results are available at request from the
authors.

starting to work in a THS rm, suggesting that adverse labor market conditions


may motivate prime-age workers to search for a THS job.


   After the start of the THS spell, we estimate that young female workers enjoy


higher wages than their peers, at least for the two years we are able to investi-


gate, a wage dierence of some two to four percent. We do not nd this pattern


for young male THS workers.    For them, post-THS wages are not signicantly


dierent from similar workers in other sectors, after accounting for worker unob-


servable quality. Older female workers are estimated to have about one percent


lower wages than women who did not work for a THS rm, but the dierence


is smaller than in the years before the THS spell where it amounted to some


three percent.   Older male THS workers receive about four percent less than


comparable workers before and after their THS spell.




7 Conclusion
Using unique linked employer-employee data from Portugal that cover the en-


tire private sector we investigate whether or not workers in THS rms receive a


lower wage than workers who work for other rms. Despite the extensive legal


protection of THS workers, we observe a wage dierence of about 23% for THS


workers in the raw data. Once we control for standard human capital indicators,


the dierential is estimated to be 9%. The available data allow a more careful


analysis in that we are able to control for unobservable workers' characteristics


by using workers' xed-eects in our estimations.   Controlling for this type of


factors, the wage penalty of THS workers is reduced to 1% to 2%, for the overall


labor force.




                                       15
   However, interesting dierences emerge across groups of workers: young and


older, males and females.   For young workers, working for a THS rm results


in wages that are higher than other sectors. The dierence is particularly high


for women who earn about 4% to 5% higher wages in THS than elsewhere; for


young men the dierence is about 1%. In contrast, for older workers THS work


is associated with a wage penalty, which is larger for males than for females.


   The wage developments before starting to work for THS are clearly dierent


for young and older workers, which may result in a dierent motivation to start


working for a THS rm.      Before entering a THS rm, prime-age workers see


their wages deteriorate relative to similar workers, suggesting that adverse labor


market conditions motivate them to search for a THS job. For younger workers,


we cannot detect any pre-TWA wage trend.


   The impact of THS employment on the subsequent career is dierent for


young and older workers, too. For young females, wages are higher one and two


years after starting to work for THS than for comparable women in other rms.


For them, the training, networking or other skills provided by THS rms lead


to a faster wage growth than for similar workers elsewhere in the economy. For


young males, the results do not dier signicantly between those who worked for


a THS rm and those who did not.      For older workers, we identify once again


a detrimental impact of THS work since after the start of the THS spell, their


wages remain signicantly below those of similar workers not in THS, particularly


for males.


   The evidence collected lends support to attempts (namely by the European


Commission) to safeguard the workers in THS rms and their subsequent career


progression, in particular for prime-age and older workers. For young workers,




                                       16
the evidence suggests that working for a THS rm can be an entry gate and


stepping stone in the labor market.
