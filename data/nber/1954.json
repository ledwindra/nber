    "abstract": "\n\nGiven the important role that school district administrators\nplay in the educational process, one might expect their\n\"performance\" to be of fundamental importance in determining both\nhow much students learn and the cost of public education to\ntaxpayers. Yet, while public debate has considered the issue of\nmerit pay plans for teachers, virtually no attention has been\ndirected to the methods by which school administrators are\ncompensated.\nThis paper provides evidence on whether school superintendents\nare explicitly or implicitly rewarded for their\n\"performance\" by higher compensation and/or greater opportunities\nfor mobility. We analyze panel data from over 700 school\n'districts in New Ycrk State during the 1978-79 to 1982-83 period.\nMeasures of performance are defined and then entered into salary\nlevel, salary change, and mobility equations. While evidence is\nprovided that school superintendents are rewarded for\n\"performance\", the magnitude of the rewards appear to be quite\nsmall.\n\n",
