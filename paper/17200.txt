ABSTRACT
This study uses a large sample of homes in the San Diego area and Sacramento, California area to
provide some of the first capitalization estimates of the sales value of homes with solar panels relative
to comparable homes without solar panels. Although the residential solar home market continues
to grow, there is little direct evidence on the market capitalization effect. Using both hedonics and
a repeat sales index approach we find that solar panels are capitalized at roughly a 3.5% premium.
This premium is larger in communities with a greater share of college graduates and of registered Prius
hybrid vehicles.

I. Introduction
On a per-capita basis, California has the most installed residential solar capacity in the
United States. Solar homes are expensive. It can cost $30,000 to install such a system. Several
state and federal programs actively subsidize this investment. Judged on strictly efficiency
criteria (foregone electricity expenditure per dollar of investment), solar panels may be a bad
investment. Borenstein (2008) finds that the cost of a solar photovoltaic system is about 80
percent greater than the value of the electricity it will produce.
Solar panels bundle both investment opportunities (the net present value of the flow of
electricity they generate) and conspicuous consumption opportunities (that it is common
knowledge that your home is “green”). Kotchen (2006) provides a theoretical analysis of the
case in which individuals have the option of consuming “impure” public goods that generate
private and public goods as a joint product. Outside of the Toyota Prius, solar homes are perhaps
the best known “green products” sold on the market.
The owner of a solar home faces low electricity bills and, if an environmentalist, enjoys
the “warm glow” for “doing his duty” and producing minimal greenhouse gases (Andreoni
1990). Because the presence of solar panels on most roofs is readily apparent, the solar home
owner knows that others in the same community know that the home owner has solar panels.
This community level re-enforcement may further increase the demand for this green product.
This “observability” is likely to be even more valued in an environmentalist community (i.e a
Berkeley) than in a community that dismisses climate change concerns. The recent political
divide between Democrats and Republicans over climate change mitigation efforts (see Cragg,
Zhou, Gurney and Kahn 2011) highlights that in conservative communities solar panels may
offer less “warm glow” utility to its owners.
We examine two facets of solar purchases in this paper. Our primary empirical
contribution is to provide new hedonic marginal valuation estimates for a large sample of solar
homes based on recent real estate transactions in San Diego County. We test the robustness of
our results using data from Sacramento County. We document evidence of a solar price premium
and find that this premium is larger in environmentalist communities. In most mature housing
markets, we expect that the econometrician knows less about the market than the decision
makers. In the case of solar panels, our interactions with professionals in the field suggests that
these professionals have little basis for estimating the pecuniary benefits of solar installation.

Our second empirical contribution is to document what types of people, in terms of education,
political ideology and demographic attributes do and do not live in solar homes. Most hedonic
studies which use sales data (rather than Census data) have little information about the household
living in the home, but we can observe household characteristics for a single year.
Our hedonic study contributes to two literatures. The real estate hedonics literature
explores how different housing attributes are capitalized into home prices. Solar installation can
be thought of as a quality improvement in the home. Recent studies have used longitudinal data
sets such as the American Housing Survey (which tracks the same homes over time) to study
how home upgrades such as new bathrooms and other home improvements are capitalized into
resale values (Harding, Rosenthal and Sirmans 2007, Wilhelmsson 2008). A distinctive feature
of solar panels is that on a day to day basis they have no “use value” as compared to a new
bathroom or kitchen. Solar panels reduce your household’s need to purchase electricity but from
an investment standpoint they represent an intermediate good that indirectly provides utility to
households. For those households who derive pleasure from knowing that they are generating
their own electricity, the solar panels will yield “existence value”. Such households will
recognize that they have reduced their greenhouse gas emissions and thus are providing world
public goods. In their local communities, such households may be recognized by neighbors for
their civic virtue. Households who take pride in engaging in “voluntary restraint” will especially
value this investment (Kotchen and Moore 2008).
A recent literature in environmental economics has examined the demand for green
products. Most of these studies have focused on hybrid vehicle demand such as Kahn (2007),
Kahn and Vaughn (2009) and Heutel and Muehlegger (2010) or the diffusion of solar panels
across communities (Dastrup 2010 and Bollinger and Gillingham 2010). By using hedonic
methods to estimate the price premium for green attributes our study shares a common research
design with several recent studies that have used hedonic methods to infer the “green product”
price premium such as Delmas and Grant’s (2010) study the demand for organic wine,
Eichholtz, Kok, and Quigley’s (2010) work on the capitalization of Energy Star and LEED status
for commercial buildings, and Brounen and Kok’s (2010) investigation of the capitalization of
residential energy efficiency when Dutch homes are certified with regards to this criterion.

II. The Hedonic Pricing Equilibrium and the Make versus Buy Decision over Solar
Installation
A household who wants to live in a solar home can either buy such a home or buy
another home that does not have solar panels and pay a contractor to install these solar panels.
This option to “make” versus “buy” should impose cross-restrictions on the size of the
capitalization effect. Consider an extreme case in which all homes are identical and there is a
constant cost of $c to install solar panels. By a no arbitrage argument, in the hedonic equilibrium,
we would recover a price premium of “c” for the solar homes. Over time, any supply innovations
that lead to a lower installation cost or higher quality of the new solar panels would be
immediately reflected in the hedonic price premium.
In reality, homes are differentiated products that differ along many dimensions. No home
has a “twin”. The non-linear hedonic pricing gradient is such that different homes are close
substitutes at the margin (Rosen 2002). Since at any point in time the same home is not available
with and without solar panels, there is no reason why the hedonic solar capitalization must equal
the installation cost.
We recognize that the investment decision in solar has an option value component.
Households may be uncertain about how much electricity the solar panels will generate, the
future price of electricity and future price declines in quality adjusted solar systems. In a
standard investment under uncertainty problem, it can be rational to delay and not exercise the
option. Households may also be uncertain about what the resale value of their house would be if
they install solar. All of these factors, as well as the household’s power needs and its ideology,
will influence demand for solar panels.
On the supply side, there are two sources of solar homes. There are existing homes whose
owners have installed solar panels in the past and are now selling their home. In contrast, the
second set of solar homes is produced by developers of new homes who will compare their profit
for building a home with and without solar panels. Such developers are likely to have invested
more effort in the basic marketing research of determining the market for this custom feature.
III. Empirical Specification
We employ both a hedonic and a repeat sales approach to assess the extent to which solar
panels are capitalized into home prices. The hedonic specification decomposes home prices by

observable characteristics for all transactions while flexibly controlling for spatial and temporal
trends. Solar panels are included as a home characteristic and average capitalization is measured
as the coefficient on the solar panel variable. The repeat sales model controls for average
appreciation of properties from one sale to the next within each census tract, with an indicator for
installation of panels between sales.
Hedonic approach
Our first approach to measuring the capitalization of solar panels in home sales is to
decompose home prices by home characteristics and neighborhood level time trends. We
interpret the average difference between the log price of homes with solar panels and those
without after controlling for observable home characteristics and average neighborhood prices in
each quarter as the average percent contribution to home sales price of solar panels. The baseline
equation we estimate in our hedonic specification is
log Price
where Price

Solar

is the observed sales price of home

(1)

X

in quarter . The variable

Solar is an indicator for the existence of a solar panel on the property and

is the implicit price

of the panels as a percentage of the sales price -- our measure of the extent of capitalization.
Home, lot, and sale characteristics are included as X .
We allow for the differential capitalization across geographic areas of home and lot size
by interacting the logs of these observable characteristics with zip code level indicator variables.2
Additional characteristics contained in X are the number of bathrooms, the number of times the
property has sold in our sales data, the number of mortgage defaults associated with the property
since 1999, indicators for the building year, if the property has a pool, a view, and is owner
occupied, and month of the year indicators to control for seasonality in home prices. In equation
(1), we are imposing a constant solar capitalization rate across time and space.3
2

There is substantial variation in climate and other local amenities across the three counties in our data
sets. Our specification allows a home or lot of a given size on the temperate coast near the beach to be
valued by the market differently than the same size home or lot in the inland desert region.
3
Recent changes in the federal tax incentives for solar may affect the solar price capitalization. On
October 3, 2008 the President signed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 into law. The
bill extends the 30% ITC for residential solar property for eight years through December 31, 2016. It also
removes the cap on qualified solar electric property expenditures (formerly $2,000), effective for property

We control for housing market price trends and unobserved neighborhood and location
amenities with census tract-quarter fixed effects,

. Allowing different appreciation patterns for

different geographies is critical because these different geographical appreciation patterns are
correlated with the incidence of solar panel installation.
Any hedonic study is subject to the criticism that key explanatory variables are
endogenous. While we have access to a detailed residential data set providing numerous controls,
we acknowledge that there are plausible reasons why the solar panel dummy could be correlated
with unobserved attributes of the home.
Our OLS capitalization estimate of

measures the average differential in sales price of

homes with solar panels and homes without panels in the same census tract selling in the same
quarter after controlling for differences in observable home characteristics. Interpreting the
hedonic coefficient estimate as the effect on home price of solar panels requires assuming that
the residual idiosyncratic variation in sales prices (

in our framework), solar panel installation

and unobservable house attributes are uncorrelated. This assumption is invalid if homeowners
who install solar panels are more likely to make other home improvements that increase sales
prices of their homes than their neighbors who do not install. We investigate how this might
influence our capitalization estimate by estimating (1) with a control for whether a home
improvement is observed in building permit data available for a large subset of San Diego
County. Alternatively, homes with solar panels may be homes of higher unobserved quality. We
explore whether these homes command a time-invariant premium by including an indicator for
whether a home will have panels installed at some point in the future relative to a particular sale.
We allow the capitalization of panels to vary over system size and neighborhood
characteristics by interacting our solar indicator variable in equation (1) with a linear term
including the characteristic. Our estimating equation becomes:
log Price

(2)

The value of installed solar panels may be influenced by factors beside the financial
implications of installation, and we estimate equation (2) using a number of proxies for other

have enough observations to determine whether the law has affected the size of the solar capitalization
effect.

factors. Households may have preferences for the production technology used to generate the
electricity they use if they are concerned about their individual environmental impact or value
their own energy independence. A desire to appear environmentally conscious may increase the
value of solar, because it is a visible signal of environmental virtue. Our proxies for
environmental idealism and the social return to demonstrating environmental awareness are the
percent of voters registered as Green party members in the census tract and the Toyota Prius
share of registered vehicles in the zip code.

For comparison, we estimate capitalization

variation by Democratic party registered voter share and the pickup truck share of registered
vehicles in the zip code. We also examine solar panel capitalization by census tract log median
income and percent of college graduates.
Repeat sales approach
A second approach to measuring the average additional value to a home sale of solar
panels is to average the additional appreciation of a single home from one sale to the next (repeat
sales) when solar panels are installed between sales. We interpret the average differential in the
appreciation in consecutive sales of properties where solar was installed between sales and other
properties in the same census tract with no installation between consecutive sales as the average
capitalization of solar panels in home sales. The baseline equation we estimate for our repeat
sales specification is

as the effect of panel installation on subsequent sales price requires the

assumption that idiosyncratic price appreciation of homes is not correlated with solar panel
installation. Again, this will not be the case if unobserved changes in properties are correlated
with solar panel installation.4
IV. San Diego County Data
Our hedonic analysis utilizes single family home sales records occurring between January
1997 and early December 2010 in San Diego County. For our sample of repeat sales of single
family homes in which solar was installed between sales we use first sales beginning as early as
January of 1990. When we restrict our analysis to homes for which we know the home square
footage, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the year the house was built or most recently
underwent a major remodeling, whether the property has a pool, whether the property has a view,
and if the property is subject to a lower tax because it is owner occupied, we obtain 364,992 sales
records for the hedonic analysis and 80,182 records for the repeat sales analysis.5 The Data
Appendix provides details on the variables.
We control for the home observable characteristics mentioned above as well as lot size,
the number of times the property has transacted in our dataset and the number of public mortgage
default notices associated with the property. We view the latter as proxies for idiosyncratic
home quality. We also control for neighborhood characteristics. We use the percent of voters in
each census tract who are Green Party registrants as a measure of the level of environmentalism
in the neighborhood. We use the Toyota Prius share of registered automobiles from zip code
totals of year 2007 automobile registration data as a proxy of the neighborhood prevalence of
both the level of environmentalism and of displayed environmentalism.6 We use the percent
4

Our hedonic and repeat sales approaches are related. Since differencing consecutive observations on the
same property in equation (1) results in equation (3), both methods estimate the same parameter for the
average capitalization of solar panels,
. An advantage of the repeat sales approach is that this
differencing controls for unobservable time-invariant housing characteristics, in addition to the observable
X , that may be correlated with solar installations. The census tract-quarter time effects,
, are jointly estimated as quarterly repeat sales price indexes for each census tract using
standard GLS procedures to account for the dependence of the idiosyncratic error ̃
on , the
number of quarters between sales.

The building year is not recorded for 1,681 properties, 46 of which are matched to solar panel
installations.

registered Democrats and vehicles classified as trucks from the respective summary datasets as
comparison measures. We control for year 2000 census tract median income and average census
tract education levels as percent of the over age 25 population who are college graduates. We
also control for census tract specific time effects.
We know which homes have solar panels from administrative records from four incentive
programs which have subsidized residential solar panel systems in San Diego County (details
about these programs are given in the Data Appendix). These programs cover virtually all solar
installations in San Diego County, as we have confirmed with conversations from industry
experts.
The solar systems consist of solar panels installed on the property, typically on the roof,
which are connected to the electricity grid, meaning the home draws electricity both from the
panels and from standard utility lines and the panels supply electricity to the local infrastructure
when production exceeds consumption at a given home. We use a dataset of the administrative
records from these programs to determine the presence of solar panels on a property being sold
as well as the installation of panels between sales.7
We know, for each installation, the address of the property, size of the system in terms of
kilowatt production potential, and date completed. Most installations also include information on
the cost of the system and the amount subsidized by the respective program. We successfully
match installation records to 6,249 single family homes by address to public San Diego County
Assessor property records for installations through early December 2010.8
We assign each home in our sample to one of four mutually exclusive and exhaustive
categories. At the time the home was sold, the home can 1) already have solar panels installed
(329 observations); 2) concurrently have installed solar panels (73 observations); 3) have solar
panels installed in the future but be sold without solar panels at the time of the specific sale
(3,433 observations); and, 4) not have solar panels as of Winter 2010. In the regressions, this

Federal tax credits allow homeowners to recover 30% of the costs of a system, but we do not have
access to tax return data as an additional source of installation detail.
8
We match nearly 90% of installation records, and have verified that many unmatched records are
business or multifamily addresses. Match quality was verified by inspecting publicly available aerial
photographs (www.bing.com/maps) of the installation addresses for the existence of solar panels for a
subset of the records.

fourth category will be the omitted category.9 We use the date of installation of each system to
determine how many homes in the same census block had solar panels installed for each month
of our sample.
We use building permit data to examine whether homeowners who install solar panels
also make other improvements to their homes more often than their neighborhoods, thus
potentially biasing our estimate of the home price premium for solar panels. Our building permit
reports begin in 2003 for San Diego City, the largest permit issuing jurisdiction in San Diego
County, and for Escondido, a smaller municipality in our sample area. We define a “major
renovation” as one referencing a kitchen, bath, HVAC, or roof with an associated value greater
than $1,000 and a “high value” renovations as one with an associated value greater than $10,000.
Summary statistics for San Diego
Table 1 shows that compared to homes sold without solar, those sold with solar are
bigger, have more bedrooms and bathrooms, and are more likely to have a view and a pool,
among various other characteristics. We thus need to control for observable home characteristics
as well as census tract location in our empirical specification so that our regressions are
comparing sales prices of homes with solar panels to sales of similar homes in the same census
tract.
Neighborhoods where solar panels have been installed are richer, whiter, more educated,
have more registered Democrats, and have larger homes than the 103 of 478 census tracts where
no solar was installed during period covered by our data (see Table 2). Our empirical analysis
exploits the gradation in these differences across neighborhoods to examine how capitalization in
home price varies with ideological and demographic characteristics.

V. Who Lives in Solar Homes?
Most hedonic real estate studies have detailed information about the home, its sales price,
location and physical attributes but they know little about the marginal buyer who chose to pay
the sales price to live there. For the city of San Diego in 2009, we have information for
9

An additional 50 transactions with an existing solar systems occurred within the year following a public mortgage
default notice or sometimes attendant notice of trustee's sale. These are excluded from the analysis here. Including
them, along with an indicator for a sale following default for all observations does substantively alter our results.

registered voters on their age, education, political party of registration, and contributions to
environmental, political, and religious organizations.10 These data enable us to investigate what
types of people self select into solar homes.
We estimate linear probability models using the full stock of City of San Diego homes in
the year 2009. We regress a dummy variable indicating whether the home has solar panels on
various household characteristics, including the number of voters in conservative (Republican,
American, and Libertarian) and liberal parties (Democrat, Peace and Freedom, and Green),
whether the two oldest registered voters in the household contribute to environmental, political,
and religious organizations, the highest education level of the two oldest registered voters, the
age of the oldest registered voter in the household, whether a child is present, the highest
imputed income (based on census block data and the age of the household) of the two oldest
registered voters in the household, and census tract fixed effects.
We find that households in which everyone is a registered liberal and in which the
household contributes to environmental organizations are much more likely to be in solar homes
controlling for education, imputed income, the age of the oldest registered household member,
and whether any children are present in the household (see Table 3).

When everyone in the

household is a registered liberal (and also controlling for contributions to organizations) the
probability of being in a solar home increases by 0.002, an 18 percent increase from the base of
0.011.

When the household contributes to environmental organizations (and controlling for

party registration) the probability of being in a solar home increases by 0.006, a 55 percent
increase.
Education, age, and income were also predictors of living in a solar home. Those with a
college education have a 0.003 greater probability of living in a solar home than those with less
than a high school education and those with a graduate degree have a 0.006 greater probability of
living in a solar home. This represents roughly a 27-55% increase in the probability of living in
a solar home. Households living in a solar home are also most likely to be those where the oldest
voter was born after 1950 (relative to being born before 1950) and households with imputed
income above the 70th percentile compared to households with imputed income between the 50th
and 60th percentile (results not shown).
10

Our data are from www.aristotle.com. We merged by street address to each home. We were able to
match 90% of the sample.

We have shown that environmentalists, the college-educated, baby-boomers and later
generations, and richer households paid the hedonic premium to live in solar homes. We next
estimate the size of these hedonic premia.
VI. Estimation results
Tables 1 and 2 showed that large nice homes in rich white neighborhoods are more likely
to have solar than small homes in poor minority neighborhoods. Our estimated solar coefficient
is the average premium for a large nice home with solar (in a rich white neighborhood) relative
to the other homes in the same neighborhood after flexibly controlling for observable differences
between the two homes. Because the hedonic regressions based on equation (2) contain census
tract by quarter fixed effects, the coefficient picks up the price premium for a home with solar
relative to homes in the same tract. Similarly, our repeat sales approach measures the average
additional increase in price between sales for homes with solar installed between sales relative to
other homes in the neighborhood because we are fitting census tract specific repeat sales indexes.
Hedonic estimates
All of our hedonic specifications estimate the capitalization of solar panels in observed
property sales while controlling for housing characteristics, and census tract/quarter fixed effects.
We find that solar panels add 3.6% to the sales price of a home after controlling for observable
characteristics and flexible neighborhood price trends (see Table 4). This corresponds to a
predicted $22,554 increase in price for the average sale with solar panels installed.11 Homes
which do not yet have solar installed but will at some subsequent time in our sample have no
associated premium, indicating that our measured solar effect is not attributable to unobserved,
time-invariant differences in these homes.

Homes in which the solar installation was done

“concurrently” receive a statistically insignificant capitalization rate of 2.8 percent, probably
because they are a combination of two types of installations. If the installation was done before
the sale (for example, for new developments or contract remodels) then the price will be
capitalized in the sales price. If the installation was done after the sale, the home owner probably
added the panels. Unfortunately, we cannot distinguish between these two cases because we do
not have the precise date of installation.
11

We convert the coefficient estimate to a dollar amount by differencing the predicted sales price from our estimated
model with our solar indicator equal to one and zero and all other characteristics equal to the mean values of all
other homes with solar.

We estimate the solar premium to be 1% higher if other homes in the same census block
have previously installed panels, but the coefficient is not statistically different from zero. We
observe a decreasing return to additional system size, a positive relationship between the
capitalization rate and Prius penetration, Green party registration share, Democrat registration
share, median income, and education, as well as a negative relationship between capitalization
and truck ownership. Controlling for building permit activity in a subsample of our data suggests
that the solar panel addition rather than unobserved home improvements are responsible for the
measured price premium.
The Returns to Solar Investment Based on the San Diego Estimates
Table 5 compares this predicted increase in price of $22,554 to four different measures of
costs of solar panels. The first potential comparison is the average total cost of the systems,
which is $35,967.12 However, this amount does not include subsidies which lowered the effective
price to homeowners to about $20,892. Although we do not know the value to the homeowners
of federal tax credits for each installation, this comparison suggests that, on average,
homeowners fully recover their costs of installing solar panels upon sale of the property. Another
measure of the value of panels is the average cost of adding panels during the quarter in which
the home was sold. We calculate this value for each quarter in our data, and for our sales the
average of this replacement cost measure is $30,858 before and $21,047 after subsidies. Buyers
purchasing homes with pre-installed solar panels are paying less than the cost of a new system.
However, the 30% tax credit lowers this replacement cost measure net measure to $14,733,
below our estimated capitalization value.
We use our hedonic estimates of equation (3) to test for heterogeneous impacts of solar
installation across communities and structure attributes. First we include the log of the size in
watts (maximum production capacity) of the solar system, N

log

as a measure of the

expected energy production from the system. Although a larger system by definition produces
more electricity, because of the structure of electricity rates and the valuation of electricity
produced under California’s “net metering” system, we do not expect capitalization to increase
proportionately with system size. For excess generation, households may opt in to the net

12

Bureau of Labor Statistics.

metering system that compensates them for electricity returned to the grid at (currently) between
$0.171 and $0.275/kWh depending on the time of day, but the compensation is capped at the
total of their annual electric bill and households face typically higher time of use prices for any
electricity purchased from the utility.13 The combined effect of the rate structure and net
metering is that electricity produced by residential solar panels in excess of their annual
electricity consumption is essentially donated to the utility. While households may value larger
systems for other reasons, additional financial incentives to installing capacity decrease with
system size.14
Allowing capitalization to vary by neighborhood characteristics demonstrates that the
addition to a home's market value from solar panels varies across neighborhoods by
environmental ideology, income, and education levels. The estimated coefficients on the linear
solar term are jointly statistically significant in each neighborhood variable specification, as
listed in Table 6. In each case, the capitalization of solar panels follows a pattern that would be
predicted by the measure of environmental ideology, income, or education. Neighborhoods with
relatively high Prius concentrations, Green party and Democrat registrant share, and median
income capitalize solar panels at a higher value, while in neighborhoods with a large share of
trucks, panels provide less of a premium to home sales.
Our final hedonic specification suggests that our estimates are not driven by unobserved
home upgrades besides solar panel installation (see Table 8). Our capitalization estimate of 6.2%
in the smaller subsample of San Diego City and Escondido is robust to the inclusion of our
building permit measures. Our estimates suggest that remodeling a kitchen or bath or replacing a
roof or HVAC system has a small impact on price, while high value renovations with costs
similar to solar panels are estimated to have a similar value on home prices.
Repeat sales estimates
13

Consumer electricity prices in San Diego County are tiered by monthly consumption, with each
household allocated a geography specific baseline amount of electricity (from 9.6 kWh along the coast to
16.4 kWh per month in the inland desert during the summer) at a relatively low price (currently
$0.039/kWh during the summer months) with an up to five fold increases for above baseline consumption
(the top of four tiers is $0.197/kWh during the summer for all consumption over 200% of the baseline).
Households pay for electricity use in excess of what is produced by the panels at any given point in time.
14
Because of these institutional factors, estimated or actual household specific expected electricity
demand is necessary for a complete accounting of the financial benefit of installing a system as a function
of system size, and is beyond the scope of this paper.

The results of our hedonic specification are largely replicated in our repeat sales
approach. All of the presented results are based on three stage GLS estimates, with observations
in the final stage weighted based on time between sales, and controlling for jointly estimated
census tract level repeat sales indexes.15 Our average capitalization estimate of 3.6% (see Table
8) implies that installing solar panels leads to an increase of $20,194 from the first to the second
sale when the average price of the first sale is $558,100. Households who install panels thus
recuperate more than their costs in subsequent sales even though our estimated value remains
below our “replacement cost” measure of solar value. Our estimate of the contribution of system
size to the capitalization rate suggests an anomalous large negative relationship. Neighborhood
characteristics estimates in the repeat sales framework also indicate that the capitalization of
solar panels depends on local preferences and incomes (results not shown).
VII. Capitalization of Solar Homes: Evidence from Sacramento County
We examine the robustness of our capitalization estimates using data on 90,686 single
family home transactions in Sacramento County between January 2003 and November 2010. We
believe that this is a 100% sample of all homes transacted in this period in the county. For each
of these homes, we observe its sales date and sales price and its physical attributes. We are also
able to identify every single family home in Sacramento County that has solar panels as of
November 2010 and that was sold at least once between January 2003 and November 2010. For
each of these 620 homes, we know the solar system’s installation date. Using the information on
the installation date and the sales date, we are able to partition these homes into four mutually
exclusive and exhaustive categories. A home can either not have solar panels, or it can have
solar panels already installed at the time of the sale (true for 256 observations), concurrently
have installed solar panels (52 observations), or in the future this same home will have solar
panels installed but it does not have solar panels at the time of the specific sale (312
observations).16 We also define a “solar” street as a street where at least two homes adjacent to
each other have solar panels. These streets are more likely to be new developments and solar
installation is cheaper when done on all homes in a new development.
15

OLS estimates of solar capitalization that do not correct for time between sales do not vary greatly from
our GLS estimates.

16

For the “concurrent” set of homes, we do not know if the home had solar panels when it was sold. Either the new
home buyer installed solar panels after purchase or the developer installed solar panels.

We find that the premium for solar homes in Sacramento is 4 percent (see Table 9),
similar to the premium for solar homes in San Diego (see Table 4). We find an even larger
capitalization of 7 percent for a solar home in Sacramento that is not on a solar street and a
smaller one of 3 percent when it is on a solar street.
VIII. Conclusion
This study used a large sample of homes in the San Diego area to provide some of the
first capitalization estimates of the resale value of homes with solar panels relative to comparable
homes without solar panels. Although the residential solar home market continues to grow, there
is little direct evidence on the market capitalization effect. Using both hedonics and a repeat sales
index approach we find that solar panels are capitalized at roughly a 3% to 4% premium. This
premium is larger in communities with more registered Prius hybrid vehicles and in communities
featuring a larger share of college graduates.
Our new marginal valuation estimates inform the debate led by Borenstein (2008) on
whether expenditure on residential solar is a “good investment.” His analysis, consistent with
those taken by others in the literature, treats residential solar installations as a ‘pure’ investment
good judged in terms of upfront cost and power generation. Our evidence suggests that similar
to other home investments such as a new kitchen, solar installation bundles both investment
value and consumption value. Some households may take pride in knowing that they are
producers of “green” electricity and “warm glow” may triumph over present discounted value
calculations in determining a household’s install choice.

Data Appendix
Solar panel installations
California's Emerging Renewables Program subsidized solar panel installations as early
as 1999 and supported almost all installations through 2007, when it was replaced as the primary
State subsidy regime by the California Solar Initiative, which continues today.17 Over 95% of the
systems in our data are installed under these two programs. The New Solar Homes Partnership
aims to encourage developers to include solar on new properties, and accounts for less than 1%
of installations in our data. These programs are administered in areas of California serviced by
17

http://www.gosolarcalifornia.org/about/gosolar/california.php

public utilities, including San Diego County. A final program supported solar panel installations
on rebuilding projects during 2005 to 2007 following wildfires in San Diego County.
Property records
The San Diego County Assessor maintains public records of characteristics and
transactions of all property in the county for tax assessment purposes. We use a corresponding
publicly available map file (GIS shapefile) of the boundaries of all county properties to
determine the acreage of the lot on which each home is built. We also obtain information on the
number of times the property has transacted in our dataset and the number of public mortgage
default notices associated with the property.18 Homes are grouped spatially using the county
property map and census tract and zip code boundary maps to assign each parcel number to the
respective geography in which its property lies.19 We use these groupings to construct spatial and
temporal controls as well as for matching a home to the characteristics of its census tract and zip
code. The assessor also maintains a record of each property transaction in the county. The date,
sales price, and parcel number identifier of all single family home sales since 1983 is publicly
available from these records, which form the dataset which is our source for sales prices and
dates.
Our building permit data begin in 2003 for San Diego City and for Escondido. In San
Diego City, building permits are required for "all new construction" including for "repair or
replacement of existing fixtures, such as replacing windows." Permits are also required for
changes to a home's “existing systems”; for example, moving or adding an electrical outlet
requires a permit."20 A permit is not required “wallpapering, painting or similar finish work” and
for small fences, decks, and walks.21

Although not all improvements may be completed with a permit, as long as homeowners who install
solar panels are not less likely than others to obtain permits for other improvements, including permitting
activity in our capitalization regressions should provide evidence of the extent of bias due to unobserved
home improvements and maintenance in our capitalization estimates.

We use voter registration summary statistics for each San Diego County Census tract in the year
2000 from the Berkeley IGS (see http://swdb.berkeley.edu/), zip code level automobile
registration summary statistics from 2007, and 2000 Census tract level demographic as sources
of descriptors of San Diego neighborhoods over which solar panel capitalization may vary. The
voter registration summary files report the total number of registrants by political party
affiliation for each census tract in California. From these reports we calculate the percent of
voters in each tract who are Green Party registrants. Similarly, we calculate the Toyota Prius
share of registered autos from zip code totals of year 2007 automobile registration data
(purchased from R.L Polk). We likewise calculate the percent registered Democrats and vehicles
classified as trucks from the respective summary datasets. We obtain reported census tract
median income and the percent of the over age 25 population who are college graduates from the
2000 Census.
