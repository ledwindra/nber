ABSTRACT
This article develops and implements a Real Option approach to value renewable natural
resources in the case of Marine Fisheries. The model includes two sources of uncertainty: the
resource biomass and the price of fish, and it can be used by fisheries to optimally adapt
their harvesting strategy to changing conditions in these stochastic variables. The model also
features realistic operational cash flows and fisheries can shutdown and reopen operations. Using
publicly available data on the British Columbia halibut fishery, the required parameters are
estimated and the model solved. The results indicate that the conservation of the biomass is both
optimal from a financial and a social perspective. The approach could be extended to other
fish species and natural resources if the appropriate data were available.

Introduction

The economic sustainability of sheries is an ongoing concern for consumers, shers, governments, intergovernmental organizations, and academics. Overshing occurs when more sh
are caught than the natural population growth, and as Ye and Gutierrez (2017) indicate,
during the last decade the worldwide percentage of stocks classied as overshed remained
stable at 30%, pointing to a failure of self-regulation and a misalignment between economic
incentives and conservation. This is the starting point of several eorts from governments and
institutions around the world to regulate these markets and achieve a sustainable equilibrium.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO (2008)) indicates
that an important part of solving the overshing problem is to adjust shing capacity to

sustainable levels through policy and regulations, including judicious use of subsidies and
eradication of illegal, unreported and unregulated shing. Nowadays one of the most used
policy device is the Individual Vessel Quota (IVQ) system, an allocation of extraction rights
of the total annual sh catch (TAC) in the form of transferable quota shares which limits
not only the total catch, but also controls the individual sher's landings.
Although the IVQ policy has been successful on limiting overexploitation, there is still
an ongoing discussion on the optimal economic level of the quota.

This paper develops a

methodology in a dynamic setting to determine the total annual sh catch which maximizes
the value of the natural resource. This optimal TAC not only maximizes the value of the
resource, but also assures the sustainability of the resource.
The valuation of natural resources under uncertainty is a problem in which the Real
Option approach has proven to be appropriate in other contexts, as the work of Brennan
and Schwartz (1985) and the signicant body of work that followed indicate, but until now
it has not been fully applied to marine sheries. This article develops and implements such
approach by modeling sheries as a complex option on the variables underlying the value
of the industry, in this case, the resource stock (biomass) and the sh price. Uncertainty is
introduced in the analysis by allowing these variables to follow dynamic stochastic processes.
The model has some features similar to Morck et al. (1989) for forestry but in this case the
resource growth is specic for a sh population, and operational cash ows are modeled as
an explicit function of the biomass and the total harvest.

To specify the biomass growth

uncertainty we follow Pindyck (1984) and use a logarithmic growth function which explicitly
captures the possibility of overpopulation and depletion.

For the price of sh we use a

standard nancial log-normal price dynamics.
To make the problem tractable we consider the case where several competitive price
taking sheries can be represented by a single shery endowed with the total annual sh

2

catch (TAC) whose property rights are well dened. To simplify the model we also assume
that the shery faces no taxes and that production can opened and shut down at no cost;
though these features could be easily incorporated in the model.
The model is solved using a value-function iteration algorithm instead of the more traditional partial dierential equation approach used in Real Options problems. The solution
approach solves for the optimal dynamic harvesting policy of a representative shery, and
then uses this policy to value the marine harvesting rights. The solution allows also to study
how the optimal level of harvesting relates to the two state variables in our model, the biomass
and the sh price, and how these rights will optimally evolve with stochastic changes in the
state variables. Based on the optimal policy it is possible to simulate the dynamics of the
biomass subject to stochastic shocks and optimal harvesting, illustrating how the biomass
will evolve over a specic time horizon.
Most of the current literature on sheries assumes that prices are constant or evolve
deterministically (Clark and Kirkwood (1986), Sethi et al. (2005)). A signicant improvement
of our model is that it includes stochastic prices which turns out to be an important issue. Our
analysis also expands the literature by including in the cost function not only xed operational
costs, but also variable costs which are related to the biomass through the sheries eciency
(catchability), and a quadratic component which incorporates an increasing marginal cost.
To examine the model implications, we apply it to the British Columbia halibut shery.
Combining multiple sources of information we constructed time series for the halibut biomass,
total harvest (landings), and price, and using this data all required parameters of the model
are estimated. Our estimates show that the volatility of the sh price growth is comparable in
size to the estimated volatility of the biomass growth, showing that when previous literature
assumed that the sh price followed a deterministic path the shery's valuation problem is
signicantly underestimating the uncertainty faced by the shers.
The model results show that it is optimal for the representative shery to preserve the
biomass for future harvesting, and that if the biomass suers signicant negative shocks then
it is optimal to drastically reduce exploitation, even fully stopping the harvest in scenarios
of low biomass or low resource prices. That is, the optimal harvesting policy exhibits strong
nancial incentives to avoid the extinction of the natural resource.
This paper also contributes to the research in the valuation of marine resources using
Real Options.

The closest paper to ours are Murillas (2001) and Poudel (2013), in which

this approach is used to value capital investments in sheries using a model with uncertainty
in the growth of the sh and in the capital, a linear production cost function with no xed
cost, but no uncertainty in the resource price.
Finally, this paper contributes to the marine sheries literature by presenting empirical

3

estimations for all the parameters required to solve the model. Data for the British Columbia
halibut shery is used because of its availability.

Data was collected from several sources

including the International Pacic Halibut Commission (IPHC)

1

and Fisheries and Oceans

2

Canada (DFO) . Cost data is hard to nd, as Clark et al. (2009) already indicated, so we
use the two available nancial surveys performed for the DFO by Nelson (2009) and Nelson
(2011) to identify the parameters of the modeled cost function.
In summary, this paper presents a Real Option approach to valuing sheries under the
optimal harvesting policy, including a full parameter estimation for its implementation to
study the optimal policies and value marine shery rights for the British Columbia halibut.
This approach is not only useful to value extraction rights for a current level of our state
variables, it also allows us to understand how it evolves over time, and presents evidence for
the value of conservation of the natural resource and the possibility of achieving an economic
sustainable equilibrium.
The paper proceeds as following. The valuation model is presented in section 2. Section
3 provides a detailed implementation of the approach using data for the British Columbia
halibut shery.

Section 4 gives our concluding remarks.

Details on the employed data,

estimation methods, and the solution algorithm are provided in the Appendix.

A Valuation Model of Marine Fisheries Rights

In this section we develop a dynamic stochastic economic model to study how sheries should
optimally harvest the resource. The value of the marine shery is assumed to depend on two
stochastic variables: the biomass and the price of sh. Following Pindyck (1984) the dynamic
of the biomass of the resource is assumed to follow:

dI = [G (I) − q] dt + σI IdZI
where

I

(1)

G (I) is the instantaneous expected rate of growth of the biomass, dZI
process, σI is the volatility of the unanticipated shocks to the resource

is the biomass,

is a standard Wiener
stock, and

q

is the harvesting rate, which is the stochastic control in the model.

Consistent with the literature (Clark (2010)), the instantaneous growth rate of the biomass
is assumed to follow a logistic function. This function explicitly captures the fact that if the
biomass approaches its carrying capacity

I max ,

resources in the environment become scarce

On the other hand, when the biomass is bellow its

reproduction falls as matching is less frequent and the resource is

in danger of extinction. Considering these characteristics the logistic function is presented

To illustrate the dynamic behaviour of a biomass with logistic natural growth, we simulate

paths are simulated over a 100 years time horizon. For this exercise we assume that the initial
biomass is

of constant annual extraction rates,

and

This exercise illustrates how variable the long-term biomass can be. For the harvesting

will not be constant and it will

evolve with the state variables.
The second source of uncertainty is the resource price. As is traditional in the nance
literature, we assume that the logarithm of the resource price follows an arithmetic Brownian
motion:

d ln P = νP dt + σP dZp
where

As indicated at the case

q = 0,

the cost function reects an assumption that production

can be costlessly shut down and reopened. This assumption is not critical for the presented
results, and a solution for a model on which the shery pays the xed cost if not producing
is included on the Appendix.
With respect to the increasing marginal cost, it is included to capture potential costs
required to achieve harvesting beyond the current levels. Examples of these costs may be

As the present

value of the cash ows is maximized over the set of feasible harvesting policies it is not
dependent of this function anymore.

A.

Boundary Conditions and Constraints

The value of the shery must satisfy the HJB equation presented in Equation 9 subject to
the following boundary conditions:

7

4

1. If the price of the sh drops to zero, the value of the shery must also go to zero :

V (I, 0) = 0

(10)

I min ,

2. If the resource biomass is lower than the depensation level

sheries will face

resource extinction, thus the value of the shery must fall to zero:

ˆ P ) = 0 f or Iˆ ≤ I min
V (I,
3. If the resource biomass is lower than the depensation level

(11)

I min ,

all shing must stop.

This impose the following constraint on the stochastic control:

ˆ P ) = 0 f or Iˆ ≤ I min

The listed boundary conditions are chosen primarily to reect nancial or technological
restrictions. The complete valuation of marine sheries rights is the solution to Equation 9,
with respect to the optimal harvesting policy and the boundary conditions 10, 11 and 12.
Together, these equations determine the optimal harvesting policy

A value-function iteration algorithm is implemented to

numerically solve the model. Details of this approach are provided in the Appendix.
In Section III we present the model solution using data of the British Columbia halibut shery, including estimation of the relevant parameters, the harvesting policy, and the
shery's value.

The British Columbia Halibut Fishery Case

To illustrate the implementation of the methodology proposed in this article we calibrate and
solve the model for the case of the British Columbia halibut. We use data from the International Pacic Halibut Commission (IPHC), established in 1923 by a convention between
Canada and the U.S. for the preservation of the Pacic halibut shery. The IPHC provides
recommendations to these governments on the total catch limit and monitors the resource
over the regulatory areas presented in Figure 3. We focus on the area 2B corresponding to
British Columbia.

4 Altough this is true, note however that given the stochastic process in Equation 3 the price will never
reach zero

Specically, we use the British Columbia halibut landing price data and nancial

reports published on their site.
In the following subsections we present the estimations for the parameters of the BC

Parameter Estimation
British Columbia Halibut Biomass Dynamic Parameters

Although the biomass is not perfectly known, the stock assessment provided by Stewart and
Hicks (2017) and Stewart and Webster (2017) is the closest proxy to its true magnitude.
As detailed in the cited documents the biomass estimation is the result of a combination of
several models which use short and long term data. Figure 4 shows the time series for the
biomass and the landings of halibut for the British Columbia region, for the period 1996-2017.

Panel A of Figure 4 shows that the biomass exhibited a strong decline between 1996
and 2000, period also characterized by high harvesting as Panel B of Figure 4 exhibits. By
2010 the biomass was almost half of the 1996 level and harvesting was reduced to levels that
remain controlled.
Using this data we estimate the parameters of the biomass logistic growth function, and
the volatility of the random shocks. Combining a discrete version of Equations (1) and (2)

From the Department of Fisheries and Oceans of Canada (DFO) website , we gather the
halibut ex-vessel historical prices for British Columbia. The time series covers from 1990 to
2016 and is used to compute the annual logarithmic return of the halibut price. These returns
are deated using the CPI for the British Columbia province.

series of halibut prices (Panel A) and the distribution of the real logarithmic price returns

British Columbia Halibut Fishery Costs Parameters

The model's cost function is presented in Equation 5 and includes a xed operating cost, a
linear harvesting cost which is related to the biomass through the shery's eciency (catchability), and an increasing marginal cost captured by the quadratic component. The parameters of this function are estimated using two surveys performed by Nelson Bros Fisheries
Ltd. for the DFO (Nelson (2009) and Nelson (2011)), these surveys are summarized in Table
III:

c0 , c1 ,

subject to

c0 > 0, c1 > 0 and c2 > 0.

Using the dierent groups of shers presented in Table III several combinations of them
can be used to identify the required parameters. Over all these combinations, the highest
cost-ecient production

is achieved using the data of {Group 1(2007), Group 1(2009)}, and

the lowest cost-ecient production is obtained when using data of {Group 3(2007), Group
3(2009)}. To implement our model, we use the set {Group 2(2007), Group 2(2009)}, as it
represent the intermediate eciency case.

For the quadratic cost parameter we choose a

value at the percentile 30% of the feasible values, that is

c2 = 35.

This value gives a balanced

combination between the increasing marginal cost and the linear component of the harvesting
cost.
As mentioned, the parameters are the solution of an over-identied system for the same
pair of costs, so all combinations of parameters trade o weight between the quadratic and
liner component of the cost to generate the same total cost.

Selecting the percentile 30%

gives a positive weight to the quadratic component but still keeps more weight on the linear
cost component, which has been the standard cost model in the sheries valuation literature.
To check for the sensitivity of this assumption, we also estimate the parameters for

Figure 7 complements the results presented in Table IV by illustrating how the proposed
parametrizations dier over the feasible range of harvesting.

Figure 7: Proposed Parametrization for the Cost Function. British Columbia Halibut Fishery.
The gure shows how both cost parametrizations are similar for observed harvest of each
of the studied groups (between 1 and 4 million pounds per year), but when the harvesting
increases the costs diverge, showing how the quadratic component of the cost generates a
higher total cost when production growths beyond the previously observed levels.
Although we are able to provide a parametrization of the cost function, it is clear that
more data will be necessary to achieve a better implementation of the model. Clark et al.

(2009) already pointed out this issue, and unfortunately these surveys are not available
for other years. Any eort to fully implement the model will have to deal with the lack of
information of the production costs, which will require collecting and standardizing additional
information.

Risk Adjusted Fishery Discount Rate

To estimate the risk adjusted discount rate for sheries we look at the historical returns for
companies classied as Fisheries using the SIC industrial classication, which codes are:

•

0912: Fisheries, Finsh

•

0913: Fisheries, Shellsh

•

0919: Miscellaneous Marine Products

•

0921: Fish Hatcheries and Preserves

Unfortunately not a signicant number of rms are recorded on CRSP with the identied
SIC codes. In Fama and French (1997) however, these rms are included in the macro-sector
portfolio Agriculture. We use this portfolio denition to obtain a robust estimation of the
sector beta and the expected rate of return. The CRISP database is used to obtain the rm's
stock returns and the historical risk-premium is obtained from Kenneth R. French site

For the returns of each rm registered in the Agriculture portfolio, 60-months rolling

The median beta for the Agriculture portfolio during the 1987-2016

Combining this value with the historical risk premium and risk-free rate

the estimated real rate of return for a shery company is

presented in Table V

The included beta is the annual average of the median 60-months rolling betas of the rms registered in the
Agriculture portfolio. The risk premium and risk-free rate are obtained from the historical excess of return
for the Canadian stock and bond market. The Bank of Canada ination target of 2% is used to obtain the
real rate using the continuous compounding Fisher equation.

Model Solution: The Value-Function Iteration Approach

To solve the HamiltonJacobiBellman equation for the shery's value

V (I, P ),

we follow

the Value-Function Iteration Approach as presented in Heer and Maussner (2009). We start
from Equation 9:



V (I, P ) = max π (I, P, q(I, P )) + e−r∆t E {V (I 0 , P 0 ) |I, P }

(14)

q≥0

where

q(I, P )

is the extraction policy, and

(I 0 , P 0 )

is the state in

∆t

units of time of the two

stochastic variables in our model, the price and the biomass.
The problem is re- written using a discretization of the continuous-time formulation.
Dene the state space for the biomass and the resource price as

(In , Pm ),

{I1 , I2 , ..., IN } and Pm ∈ {P1 , P2 , ..., PM }. The optimal control is also
set qj ∈ {0, q1 , ..., qJ }. Over the state space the function V = Vnm is
representing the value of the shery for the state (In , Pm ).
The biomass and the price stochastic shocks are denote by

ZI

and

ZP

where

The solution algorithm follows Heer and Maussner (2009). It starts from a guess of the value-

0
and iterates over the dened state space. In each point of the two-dimensional
Vn,m
state (In , Pm ) the right-hand-side of Equation 15 is maximized using the stochastic optimal control qj . If the optimized value of the current iteration is greater than the previous
function

iteration value-function for the state, the old value-function is replaced by the current iteration maximized value. The process is repeated until no signicant changes are made to the
value-function in the latter iteration.
To complement this short description we present a formal scheme of the solution algorithm
in the Appendix. The following section presents the results of the application of the valuefunction iteration approach for the British Columbia halibut shery.

Numerical Results

As previously mentioned the model is solved for the British Columbia halibut shery. Based
on Clark (2010) we consider a 150 days season, therefore the relevant time step for our
numerical solution is

∆t = 1/150.

The rest of the parameters used to solve the model are

summarized in Table VII.

Results for a social rate

characteristic and main conclusions of the following numerical results do not drastically
change on these additional cases.

C.1.

Value Function and Harvesting Policies for the British Columbia Halibut
Fishery Parametrization and Real Risk Adjusted Discount Rate

The result for the value of the British Columbia halibut shery under the optimal harvesting
policy is reported in Figure 8.

Figure 8:

Value of the British Columbia Halibut Fishery Using the Real Risk Adjusted

Fishery Discount Rate of

2.8%

As the resource price increases, current revenues and the incentives to increase the harvest also increase.

But this will diminish the biomass level, reducing the future resources

growth and increasing the future marginal cost trough the catchability of the resource. This
represents the main economic trade-o in the model.
This trade-o can be observed in Figure 8. As the marginal increment in the value of the
shery is positive when the price or the biomass grow. The marginal increment in the value
over the state space is non-linear, however, an extra unit of biomass becomes more valuable
in high price states in comparison to low price states, as in high biomass states an extra unit
not only improves the the current and future prots in a high price state, it also reduces the
extraction cost.
The value of the shery is zero in the case that the biomass reaches the lower boundary

I min ,

reecting that once this level is reached extinction becomes inevitable.

19

Figure 9: Optimal Harvesting Policy of the British Columbia Halibut Fishery Using The
Real Risk Adjusted Fishery Discount Rate

2.8%

The optimal harvesting policy is chosen to maximize the value of the shery. This value
is shown in Figure 8. Now we turn to examine the optimal harvesting policy for dierent
values of the state variables. Figure 9 illustrates the range of daily optimal harvesting, which
goes from zero, in states of low biomass and price, to approximately 0.13 million pounds per
day (20 million pounds per year) in states of high price and biomass at its carrying capacity
(I

max

= 85

million pounds). The optimal harvesting policy is also a non-linear function of

the state variables.
For example, the harvesting policy in a high price state ($20 CAD per pound) goes from
zero to 0.13 million pound per day as the biomass increases, but if the price is low ($5 CAD
per pound) harvesting goes from zero to just 0.04 million pound per day. Table IX presents
results for the value function and optimal harvesting policies for dierent values of the state
space, including the current level of biomass and halibut price.
Figure 9 also indicates that the shery should optimally close operations temporarily in
several states, most of them characterized by low biomass and low sh prices. The periods
without harvesting allow the stock to recover, increasing future growth and reducing future
harvesting costs.

Panel A of Table IX shows that the value of British Columbia halibut shery at the
current state is approximately $2.52 billion CAD. The optimal harvesting policy will be 7.44
million pounds per year, which is consistent with the current total annual sh catch (TAC)
of of 7.45 million pounds per year.
The extraction optimal policy presented in Panel B of Table IX illustrates how it changes
for dierent values of the state space, highlighting the importance of a dynamic harvesting
rights system which adjust promptly to changes on the resource price and biomass assessment.

Simulations of the Biomass and Harvesting Policies for the British Columbia

Figure 10 presents two dierent paths for the simulated sh price, biomass, and harvesting

Figure 10 shows a signicant variability of the optimal harvest for the simulated paths.
As the two states variables experience random shocks, the uncertainty faced by sheries is
signicant, and the optimal harvesting policy adjusts reecting those changes. Path 1 is
characterized by negative price shocks during the rst 5 simulated years, which generates a
reduction in the harvesting, even reaching a zero harvest period by the end of year 8. As
the price remains low not a signicant amount of resource is extracted (approximately 0.03
million pounds per day, 4.5 million pounds per year), allowing the biomass to growth, even
reaching its carrying capacity (I

) at year 6. Path 2 diers by exhibiting a high price

As a consequence, the extraction policy remains at high

levels (approximately 0.07 million pounds per day, 10.5 million pounds per year), and the
biomass remains at a level close to the initial state even after suering positive shocks by the
end of year 5.

These simulations exemplify the results of the model.

First, we observe a signicant

amount of uncertainty and a harvesting policy which adjusts promptly. Second, we notice
that the biomass will increase in most of the simulated paths and it will not reach levels
close to extinction with

99%

probability, presenting strong evidence for the intuition that

conservation is economically optimal.

C.3.

The British Columbia Halibut Fishery Parametrization and a Social Discount Rate

The previous results are computed using a private discount rate. Given that this market is
regulated by governmental institutions and resources are publicly owned, its important to
understand how these results will change if a social discount rate is used (Clark and Munro
(2017)). We set the social real discount rate to

1%, increasing the weight of future cash ows

relative to current cash ows and the importance of the conservation of the resource. Figure
12 present the results for the value function and harvesting policies for the model using this
new rate.

23

Figure 12: Value and Optimal Harvesting Policy for the British Columbia Halibut Fishery
Using the Social Discount Rate of

1%

The value of the shery increases in comparison to the private discount rate as the future
cash ows have a higher present value.

With respect to the extraction policy the main

dierence is that there are more states with a no extraction policy, indicating that the value
of future revenues generated by conservation increase as they are discounted at a lower rate.
As in the previous section we simulate 10,000 paths for the biomass and the halibut price,
over a

10

Years horizon and calculate the annual percentiles and median for the optimal

harvesting and the biomass over the simulations.

This allows us to compare the results

with the ones obtained using a private discount rate. We present the annual percentiles and
harvesting median over the simulated paths.

Figure 13: Simulated Biomass and Harvesting Policy for the British Columbia Halibut Fishery Using the Social Discount Rate of

1%,

Compared to the Simulations Computed Using

The Real Risk Adjusted Fishery Discount Rate

2.8%.

Figure 13 shows that when using a social discount rate the model generates a higher
median biomass over all the simulated period. This is the result of a harvesting policy which

24

is also smaller than when discounting with the private rate over all the period.
Panel A of Figure 14 reports the volatility of the biomass over all the simulations. Although both simulations are subject to the same sources of uncertainty, the overall variability
of the resource stock is lower when we use a social discount rate. This is evidence of a more
conservative extraction resulting in less extreme scenarios. Panel B of Figure 14 shows the

1th

percentile of the simulated biomass. This percentile of the simulated paths is higher for the
social rate of discount. Thus, there is even a smaller probability of observing the depletion
of the resource in this case.

1th

Percentile of the Simulated Biomass for the British Columbia

Halibut Fishery Using the Social Discount Rate of

1%,

Compared to the Simulations Com-

puted Using The Real Risk Adjusted Fishery Discount Rate

2.8%.

In summary, when the social discount rate is used, the optimal harvest policy is lower and
a zero harvest is more common than in the case where the private discount rate is used. Under
this optimal policy the variability of the biomass paths is reduced and in most cases it is
optimal to increase the biomass growth, prioritizing future resource stock over contemporary
revenues.

IV.

Conclusions

This article develops and implement a Real Option approach to value a renewable natural
resource with two sources of uncertainty: the resource stock and the price. The solution of
the model is obtained by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for the value of the
Fishery.

To achieve this goal we follow a value-function iteration approach.

Overall, the

results highlight the strong non-linear relation between the biomass and the resource price
on the value of the shery and the optimal harvesting policy, and the importance of the
option to shut down and re-open the sheries.

25

The solution is implemented using the estimated parameters for the British Columbia
halibut shery, for which we include the methodological details and data to help future
research. The model results are used to simulate the dynamic of the studied shery, nding
that in the majority of the simulated paths it is optimal to increase the biomass. For negative
shocks to the biomass growth we obtain reductions of the resource stock, but the performed
simulations present evidence that with 99% probability we will not observe biomass levels
close to the extinction. For the current state

I0 = 57.82

million pounds,

P0 = 7.75

CAD per

pound, we found an optimal annual harvesting policy is 7.4 million pounds per year, which
is comparable with the current harvesting levels.
We repeat the analysis for a social discount rate, nding that a zero harvest policy is more
common over the state space, and that the variability of the simulated harvesting policies and
biomass are reduced. In this case conservation becomes increasingly valuable so the optimal
harvest prioritizes future resource stock over current revenues.
The model solved for a realistic set of parameters suggests that an economically viable
shery is feasible, that overshing is indeed not optimal, even in the presence of two signicant
sources of uncertainty as the sh price and the biomass stock. This highlights the value of
conservation and that current eorts to control overshing are indeed ecient from a social
and a nancial perspective.

Appendix A: Value-Function Algorithm Scheme
In this section we sketch the solution algorithm, describing the key steps, but abstracting
from detailed calculations. Broadly, we start from an initial value function and iterate over
the policy space until a maximum is attained. The outcome of the process is the maximized
value-function, and the optimal policy, for each point in our two-dimensional state space.

Step 1: Initialize

v0 .

To dene the initial value of the value function, we use a coarse grid on the dened
interval

[I1 , IN ] × [P1 , PM ],

and compute using our algorithm. Then, we use our desired grid,

interpolate using the coarse grid, and the estimated value function, to obtain an initial value
function on the ner desired grid.

Appendix B: Numerical Solution with Alternative Cost
Parametrization
The model is solved for an alternative set of parameters for the cost function, presented in
Table X.

Figure 15 illustrates that the value function is similar to the baseline case in shape, but the
optimal harvesting policy exhibits a smaller region of no-extraction and of high production.

and Using The Real Risk Adjusted Fishery

2.8%.

Figure 16 shows the simulated biomass and optimal harvesting policy with the new
parametrization of the cost function.

The optimal harvesting policy is in general lower

than in the case presented in the main text. For example, for the current state space the
optimal harvesting is 6.27 million pounds per year versus 7.44 million pounds per year for
the previous case. As a consequence, the level of the biomass is higher for the median and
the 1% and 99% percentiles.

c2

is the quadratic cost reecting an

φ is the shing power parameter, or catchability, which captures

the eciency of the extraction technology. Results are presented in the following gures.

Figure 17: Value and Optimal Harvesting Policy for the British Columbia Halibut Fishery
for the Alternative Cost Function with Costly Shutdown and Using The Real Risk Adjusted
Fishery Discount Rate

2.8%.

Figure 17 illustrates that the value function and the harvesting policies are similar to
the previously presented cases, being the main dierence that when closing is costly the no
harvesting region is smaller, but this dierences are observed only in low price states, which
are in most of the cases not highly probable. Overall, these results indicate that the costlessly
shutdown assumption is not critical for the results presented in the main text.

Figure 18:

Halibut Fishery for the Alternative Cost Function with Costly Shutdown and Using The
Real Risk Adjusted Fishery Discount Rate

2.8%.

Figure 18 shows that the simulated biomass and harvesting policies are similar to the
previously presented cases.

The main dierences are observed for low price- low biomass

states which are not highly probable. Thus the simulation results and their results remain
similar to the ones presented in previous sections.
