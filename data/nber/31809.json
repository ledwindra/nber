    "abstract": "\n\nChina\u2019s recently launched CO2 emissions trading system, already the world\u2019s largest, aims to contribute importantly toward global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  The system, a tradable performance standard (TPS), differs importantly from cap and trade (C&T), the principal emissions trading approach used in other countries.  This paper presents the structure and results from a multi-sector, multi-period equilibrium model tailored to evaluate China\u2019s TPS. The model incorporates distinctive features of China\u2019s economy, including state-owned enterprises and electricity market regulation. It distinguishes between the TPS and C&T and considers a wide range of potential future TPS designs.\nKey findings include the following.  The TPS\u2019s environmental benefits exceed its costs by a factor of five when only the climate-related benefits are considered and by a significantly higher factor when health benefits from improved air quality are included.  The TPS\u2019s interactions with China\u2019s fiscal system substantially affect its costs relative to those of C&T.  Employing a single benchmark (standard) for the electricity sector would lower costs by 34 percent relative to the four-benchmark system that is actually in place but increase the standard deviation of percentage income losses across provinces by more than 60 percent.  Introducing an auction as a complementary source of allowance supply can lower economy-wide costs by at least 30 percent.\n\n",
