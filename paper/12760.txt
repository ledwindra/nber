NBER Working Paper No. 12760
December 2006
JEL No. F1,F13
ABSTRACT
South African trade policy has exerted a major influence on the composition and aggregate growth
of trade. In the Apartheid period, trade protection seriously impeded both exports and imports, and
the economy depended on favorable global commodity price trends to avoid running into an external
constraint. South Africa developed a comparative advantage in capital-intensive primary and manufactured
commodities partly because of its natural resource endowments but also because the pattern of protection
was particularly detrimental to exports of non-commodity manufactured goods. High and opaque
tariffs seriously impeded export growth. When global commodity markets were weak, in combination
with declining gold exports, this seriously constrained aggregate growth and dulled the response of
exports to the weaker rand in the late 1980s. On the other hand, surcharges were effective in reducing
imports. By contrast, trade liberalization in the 1990s not only increased imports but, by reducing both
input costs and the relative profitability of domestic sales, also boosted exports. The growth in non-commodity
manufactured sectoral exports as a result of liberalization was actually faster than sectoral imports.
This evidence suggests that additional trade liberalization could well be part of the strategy to enhance
export diversification. It points to the importance of policies that afford South African firms with access
to inputs at world prices as well as a competitive real exchange rate.

South African Trade Policy Matters: Trade Performance
& Trade Policy
Introduction
As its name implies, the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative of South Africa
(ASGI-SA) seeks to accelerate South African economic growth and make it more
equitable. The approach is to identify key constraints and then to adopt a number of
policies to eliminate them. The six constraints that have been identified are (a) currency
volatility; (b) infrastructure; (c) skilled labor and settlement patterns; (d) barriers to entry
and the regulatory environment; and (e) deficiencies in state organization. These
constraints are to be tackled though several major policies initiatives. They include
macroeconomic policies; infrastructure projects; sector investment and promotion
strategies; education and skills interventions, second economy interventions, and
governance and institutional issues.
An external constraint? It is striking that trade performance per se is not
mentioned as a major constraint on growth, although it is implicit in the concern voiced
about the volatility of the exchange rate and the sector investment and promotion
strategies devoted to export diversification2 It is also striking that trade policy is not given
a key role as a policy instrument, although there are policies to improve the process
through which trade and industrial policies are coordinated.
Yet an overview of current and past trends suggests that an external constraint
may well inhibit economic growth. Over the past decade, the South African economy has
managed growth of three percent and experienced a small real depreciation of the rand.
Yet despite the robust performance of commodities prices recently, over the same period
2

The ASGI-SA document indicates that the purpose of these strategies is to “help diversify an economy
dependent on commodity exports.” The idea is to be “modest in the number of industry focus areas” in
order to be bold in the development and implementation of strategies”. (There are three priority sectors
BPO, Tourism, Bio-fuels) There is recognition of the need for linking trade and industry policy in the
document but the emphasis is on process rather than prescriptions of particular policies: (strengthened
intelligence and negotiation machinery, stronger consultative frameworks). In part as a complement to
ASGI-SA there is also an industrial policy strategy developed by the DTI which in part overlaps and in part
extends these approaches

the balance on goods and services has shifted from a surplus of 0.7 percent of GDP in
1995 to a deficit of 1.5 percent in 2005.

Moreover, South Africa’s history could suggest that concern is in order. As
reported in Table 1, which provides decade averages, the last time South Africa managed
about six percent real economic growth – the 1960s – the economy basically ran out of
export steam as import volumes, (averaging 7.8 percent annual growth) far outpaced
exports (averaging 4.5 percent.). In combination with declining terms of trade, the
current account moved steadily into deficit over that decade. Though South Africa
experienced commodity booms in the 1970s in which the terms of trade improved by a
total annual average rate of 4.9 percent and the Rand appreciated in real terms, the GDP
growth performance was a tepid 3.4 percent and South Africa’s share in global
commodity exports actually declined. The economic stagnation of the 1980s -- with
annual growth at just 1.5 percent -- was in no small measure due to an externally imposed
constraint that also made clear the degree to which the economy depended on trade. 3
Perhaps, though, such fears are misguided. The current account deficit could
reflect a temporary spending boom that will reverse on its own. In addition, the past may
be a poor guide to the future. Political factors played a major role in South Africa’s
previous economic difficulties and these are no longer present. In particular, the Soweto
uprisings contributed significantly to problems in the 70s, and sanctions in the 1980s
thwarted responses to the weaker rand. Some now believe that with the rapid growth in

China and India, the world is again entering a long commodities “super cycle” in which
robust commodities prices should ensure adequate export revenues. In the 1970s when
there was such a super-cycle, aggregate export volumes were depressed by declining gold
production, but gold now accounts for just 6 percent of exports. Thus if South African
non-gold export volumes could match the 4.8 annual volume growth over the 1970s and
the terms of trade improve by the 4.9 percent during that decade – concerns about an
external constraint could well be misplaced.
But even a commodity super-cycle is no panacea. While it may remove the
external constraint, and boost the real exchange rate, by strengthening the Rand, a
commodity super cycle will make it even more difficult to achieve the export
diversification sought in ASGI-SA program. Commodity prices are very volatile, and
excessive dependence on such products subjects the economy to considerable instability.
Moreover, since primary and manufactured natural-resource based exports are highly
capital – intensive, dependence on commodities means employment growth will have to
come from other sectors. On the other hand, the cycle could well be considerably weaker
than it was in the 70s. In this case the economy could sustain high growth for a period by
borrowing from abroad, but eventually other adjustments would be required. A weaker
real exchange rate would reduce imports and stimulate exports and it could be part of the
response. But a lower rand is inflationary, and if the reserve bank sticks to its inflation
targets, and if real wages are insufficiently flexible, the adjustment could be painful.
These dilemmas lead naturally to a search for other policy instruments that could
be used to stimulate production and growth. In this context, industrial and trade policies
merit consideration. Trade policy is also of interest because by studying responses to
changes in trade policy, we can learn how South African firms will respond to incentives
generally and lower input costs in particular.
For this reason, in this paper we try to understand how South African trade
performance has responded to trade policy in the past. We do this by a detailed
examination of how trade policies have affected both the volume and composition of
trade. If there is one main conclusion we will offer here, it is that trade policy matters.

South African Trade Policy Matters

We will present evidence that to a significant degree, South Africa’s weak trade
performance has been a self-inflicted wound. In particular, the import substitution
policies of the 1970s and 1980s not only effectively blocked imports, but also
discouraged exports and the anti-export bias was particularly large for non-commodity
exports. We will also show that the more recent liberalization in the 1990s played a very
important role in stimulating exports in general and non-commodity exports in particular
and that, at a sectoral level, the impact of lower tariffs in making exporting more
attractive was stronger the impact in stimulating imports. The impact of liberalization on
import growth is obvious, but its role in export growth is less appreciated and more
controversial. To be sure trade theorists have long recognized Lerner’s symmetry
theorem (Lerner 1936) that a tax on imports is a tax on exports but this key proposition is
often forgotten in discussions of trade policy. Our analysis therefore leads us to place
particular emphasis on policies that can assist exporters by reducing their costs, not only
through further tariff reductions but also through other policies that focus in key input
prices.
We should make clear that by saying that trade policy matters, we do not mean to
imply that it alone matters or that in the future, South Africa should avoid other policies
and rely on trade policy (liberalization) alone in its efforts to achieve faster growth or
increased employment. But our evidence does suggest that additional trade liberalization
could contribute to providing South Africa with a more diversified and sustainable export
sector.
The views we will present here are not uncontroversial. Others have reached quite
different conclusions, which may explain why trade policy has not been given a central
role in the ASGI-SA programs. One view discounts the impact of protection on exports.
According to Bell, Farrell and Cassim (1999) for example “The growth of South Africa’s
exports has not been limited primarily by the lack of an ‘export culture’ or the ‘antiexport bias created by protection or by an inherently uncompetitive manufacturing

7

sector.” 4 While we agree with these authors that South African manufacturers are not
inherently uncompetitive and that the exchange rate (and its interactions with commodity
prices) has been an important part of the story, we disagree that the anti-export bias due
to protection deserves no role in the explanation. In fact, we will present evidence it has
been very important in stimulating export growth.
Another view is that protection contributes to a more diversified industrial base.
But diversification achieved in this manner is inefficient and may lead to firms that are
permanently dependent on government assistance and protection and can only operate in
the local market. By contrast, firms that become globally competitive enjoy the unlimited
potential of the world market. Further, we also present evidence that liberalization has
helped diversify exports and through this the industrial base.
Outline: Section I of the paper reviews South African trade performance and
highlights differences before and after the mid 1980s. In particular it notes the
sluggishness in both imports and non-commodity exports prior to 1985 and the rapid
growth thereafter. A constant-market shares analysis for the two periods is also
undertaken and it shows that South African competitiveness declined in the first period.
In the second period, judged by its global market shares in the goods it exports, South
African has been competitive. However, its dependence on commodities has led to its
recent declining share of world trade.
Section II considers import performance. Econometric estimation is used to
distinguish the various sources of import growth. In particular, we find that trade policy
was especially important in suppressing import demand in the 80s and causing it to
accelerate in the 90s. While we find an import elasticity of slightly less than unity for
Gross Domestic Expenditures in general, growth in the stock of fixed capital has up to
twice that intensity. This suggests that import growth could be particularly rapid under
ASGI-SA as investment rises to move the economy to a more rapid growth path.
4

And while they argue that South Africa’s trade regime has been biased against non-commodity exports,
Jenkins, Bleaney and Holden (1996) conclude that the impacts of the trade liberalization programs in the
1990s were small

8

Section III considers export performance. It presents visual evidence that the
relationship between exports and the real exchange rate and export profitability have not
been constant over time and indeed linking these causally for the period as a whole in a
single equation is problematic. We also estimate export functions for aggregate non-gold
merchandise exports, manufacturing exports as well as exports of non-commodity and
commodity manufacturing. We find that exports respond to real depreciations, but
nominal exchange rate shocks have a small effect on exports in the long-run, as domestic
price increases erode the improved profitability of export supply. We also find that lower
tariffs reduce domestic producer prices and through this improve export performance.
Section IV investigates the relationship between tariff liberalization and export
performance using disaggregated industry data. There is clearly a very strong relationship
between non-commodity export volumes and measures of trade policy such as tariff
revenue collections and (implicit) export taxes. The estimated export taxes measures
indicate that trade policy has been particularly biased against non-commodity exports. In
1989, for example, the implicit taxes on non-commodity exports were 52 percent,
compared with 26 percent on manufactured commodities and 18 percent for goods
overall. Drawing on a panel of 44 manufacturing sectors for the period since 1990, we
find that non-commodity exports are more responsive to changes in real exchange rates
and relative costs than other exports. They are also more responsive to shifts in export
taxes and other determinants of anti-export bias than commodity exports. This suggests
that prior to 1990 the impact of the trade regime was particularly constraining on these
exports. By contrast, the combination of greater responsiveness with the relatively larger
reductions in anti-export bias on non-commodities exports helps explain their more rapid
growth in the 1990s.
Section V considers the impact of trade liberalization on trade balances at the
sectoral level. Higher surcharges, which were imposed during balance of payments
crises, were effective in boosting these. More generally however, the results indicate that
in sectors producing non-commodity manufactured goods, the impact of lower tariffs in

stimulating faster export growth is greater than the impact in stimulating faster import
growth. Further liberalization is therefore not likely to substantially worsen the trade
balance leading to a foreign exchange constraint to growth.

Section I: South African Trade Performance.--A tale of two
periods.
Consider the picture of South African trade performance, illustrated in Figure 1
below. We show an aggregate series of the volume of imports of goods and services but
on the export side we distinguish goods and services according to dependence on primary
commodities. Given South Africa’s dependence on commodity-based manufactures such
as iron, steel and non-ferrous metals, for this purpose the conventional separation of
primary and manufactured goods does not suffice. Accordingly, we have included
manufactured goods that have a high share of primary commodity inputs in their value in
the commodities classification. 5 Thus the category “non-gold commodities” includes
both primary commodities and manufactured goods with a relatively high share of
primary commodity inputs in final sales. “Non-commodities” refers to exports of services
and other manufactured products. We also at times refer only to “non-commodity
manufactures”.

As reported in Table A1, the manufacturing sectors have been arranged according to the share of primary
commodity inputs in final sales. The industries are coke and refined petroleum, food, tobacco, iron and
steel, other manufacturing, non-metallic minerals, wood and wood products, basic chemicals, and basic
nonferrous metals

There is some truly remarkable behavior depicted in the Chart on trade volumes.
In the first part of the period what stands out is the stagnant trade behavior. In 1991, for
example, the volume of goods and services imports was actually no higher than it was
twenty years earlier and the volume of non-commodity exports was just eleven percent
higher. By contrast there is a slow but clear upward trend in the growth of non-gold
commodity exports although it is more sluggish in the 80s than the 70s. Since over the
entire period, gold export volumes declined, these non-gold commodities were basically
the only source of export growth. The growth was sufficient, however, only to raise the
aggregate volume of exports of goods and services in 1991 to twenty percent above its
levels in 1971. Real GDP had increased by 54 percent over the two decades and the real
exchange rate was at a similar level in both years. So in fact the economy had become
significantly more closed for reasons that are not attributable to either the exchange rate
or economic growth. Considering that over the same period, according to the WTO, the
volume of world trade and world GDP had increased by 90 and 70 percent respectively, it
seems fair to say that something else caused South Africa to miss out on two decades of
globalization.6

But starting in 1987, the picture changed. All three of the series have markedly
upward trends. Between 1991 and 2001, for example, the volumes of imports and exports
of goods and services increased by 73 and 70 percent respectively. While gold export
volumes had continued to decline – they dropped 30 percent over the decade – exports of
other commodities were up fifty percent and non-commodity exports by an astounding
200 percent.
The more recent behavior of trade volumes is also very striking. Between 2000
and 2005 import volumes have again grown extremely rapidly – averaging 7.6 percent
per year – almost twice the growth rate in GDP over the period. This import growth has
been particularly concentrated in durables – with auto imports averaging 23.5 percent
annual growth over the five year period and commodities imports growing at 8.1 percent
per year. By contrast export volume growth has been very sluggish, averaging just 2.7
percent annually (Table 2). While non-commodity exports have managed an annual
growth rate of 4.2 percent, this is mainly due to autos. It is also striking that until
recently, commodity export volumes have grown slowly with gold export volumes
declining precipitously and other commodities managing just 2.5 percent growth. The
bright part of the export picture is actually hidden in these aggregates. It is services
exports which have grown by 8.6 percent annually.
The trade balance reflects price behavior as well as volumes. Measured in US
dollars in 2005, export prices were up by sixty eight percent over their 2000 levels but the
improvement in South Africa’s terms of trade was surprisingly modest – only nine
percent –because dollar import prices also increased rapidly. All told therefore the trade
balance in goods and services has declined from a surplus of 3.9 percent of GDP in 2001
to a deficit of 1.5 percent in 2005.

Constant Market Shares Analysis: more clues.
A second and complementary perspective on South African trade can be obtained
by considering its share in the world market. We have used UN COMTRADE data to
explore the performance in market shares between 1970 and 1983 and then between 1985
and 2000. Trade flows are classified by export market and commodity and the analysis is
applied to decompose changes in export performance due to each factor and a residual.
The decomposition is presented in Table 3.
In the first period, had South Africa simply held its market shares its exports
would have increased by 9.9 billion dollars. Instead they rose by just 6.4 billion, a
substantial shortfall. The analysis suggests that only a small part of the shortfall was due
to the fact that world trade in commodities rose more slowly than world trade elsewhere
and a much greater reason to the poor geographic distribution of its export markets. But
almost a third is not explained by these considerations and is attributed to “declining
competitiveness.”

The more recent period, 1985 - 2000 is an interesting contrast. South Africa once
again lost global market shares, but in fact over this period the major problem was the
commodity composition of South African trade in particular South Africa’s dependence
on primary commodities. In fact, the more recent period is actually a period in which
judged by its world market shares in the commodities it exported, South African
competitiveness actually improved.
The improved performance of South African exports, particularly non-gold
exports, in the 1990s is also shown in Table 4. When gold is excluded, South African
exports grew 5.7 percent grew between 1990 and 2000, which is close to the global and
Australian rates. Moreover, the 7.8 percent annual growth in manufacturing exports
actually outpaced Australia and the world as a whole (6.9 percent) although lagging far
behind Malaysia. Performance in medium-tech manufacturing was actually very strong
and double the world pace and in large part reflects the growth in auto exports.

In sum, the tale of two distinct periods that emerged from looking at South
African data is reinforced by considering its global export performance. There is an early
period in which its competitiveness was a problem and the more recent period, in which it
has been more constrained by its patterns of specialization.

What explains these trade performance patterns? Is it simply a story of external
forces such as trade sanctions, commodity price fluctuations and exchange rate
movements that have driven South African trade or have trade policies played an
important role? In what follows we will show that South African trade policy has made
an important contribution to these outcomes and we will do this by looking first at
imports and then exports.

Section II: Explaining Imports.
Consider Figure 3 depicting annual growth in import volumes and GDP. The first
noteworthy feature of import behavior is its highly cyclical and volatile behavior.
Moreover, the relationship to GDP growth is by no means constant. While there is clearly
a correlation, particularly during the 1990s, the relationship does not always appear to be
proportional and there are periods in which the changes in the variables move in opposite
directions. Yet as the next chart shows, there is much greater stability in the long run
relationship.

Figure 4 shows the volume of imports, Real Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE),
Real GDP (GDP), and Gross domestic fixed capital formation (GDFI). It indicates that
over the long run import volumes have basically grown in line with GDP. There is
however, an interesting deviation in behavior in the 1970s and 1980s which demonstrates
the power of the import-substitution policies applied by South Africa as well as reflecting
the decline in investment during this period.

In the 1960s, import volumes move in line with GDP but in the 1970s and early
1980s they flatten out. The initial decline in imports from the mid 1970s corresponds with
declining investment associated with the tightening of fiscal and monetary policy in
response to the Balance of Payment crisis arising from the political unrest in 1976. The
imposition of surcharges in April 1977 (see figure below) further dampened import
demand during this period. Import demand recovered during the late 1970s in response to
the gold price-led recovery in investment and GDP, but this improvement was short lived.
The collapse in the gold price in the early 1980s, the debt crisis in the mid 1980s and the
considerable decline in investment (public, parastatal and private) lowered import
demand during the 1980s. It is only from the early 1990s that import demand recovered,
led in part by a recovery in investment and GDP growth.
A graphical analysis also reveals the sensitivity of import demand to relative
prices, including price shocks from changes in tariff protection. Trade policy in the
analysis is captured by the ratio of tariff revenue collections (including surcharges) to the
value of imports (TARSURP). The series is not ideal for our purposes for both conceptual
and statistical reasons, but it is the most readily available. First, it fails to capture the
impact of non-tariff barriers, second it will be sensitive the changes in import
19

composition and third the effects of trade protection and trade liberalization will be
understated because the import mix will itself be influenced by tariff changes. For
example, no revenues will be collected when tariffs are prohibitive. An alternative
measure of protection is the difference between the import producer price index (PPIM)
and the import unit value index (PMUV). 7 Import Unit values are problematic because
they fail to account for quality changes and sectors where tariffs are prohibitive, but,
since they exclude import duties, they afford an opportunity to obtain separate estimates
of the impact of trade policy on prices and import behavior. The PPI measures of import
prices, by contrast have the virtue that, in addition to the import prices charged by
foreigners, they capture the influence of both tariff and non-tariff trade barriers on import
prices.
To evaluate changes in protection over the period, the following chart presents an
index (2000 = 100) of the ratio of imported PPI to import unit values (PPIM/PMUV) as
well as the collection rates excluding surcharges (TARP) and including surcharges
(TARSURP). What is interesting is that all series suggest policy was very volatile
although moving towards liberalization in the 70s, then in the mid to late 1980s there was
a strong shift towards protection through the use of surcharges followed by an almost
continuous shift towards liberalization until very recently. These trends are somewhat at
odds with those (e.g. Bell, Farrell and Cassim, 1999) who argue there was significant
liberalization between 1985 and 1990 and Jenkins et al. (1996) who emphasize the
liberalization after 1995 but downplay the shifts due to the removal of surcharges in the
first half of the decade.

PPIM/PMUV (2000=100)

To evaluate the effect of relative prices on import volumes, the following charge
plots import volumes against the ratio of tariff revenue collections (including surcharges)
to the value of imports (TARSURP) and two measures of the ratio of import prices to
domestic manufactured good producer prices. The first measure, PPIM/PMAN, measures
the ratio of the domestic producer price of imported goods to domestic manufactured
good prices and the second, PMUV/PMAN, measures the ratio of import unit values to
domestic manufactured goods prices.
The relative price series behave in a striking fashion: While they remain fairly
constant through the 1960s they then rise steadily through 1986, partly in response to
rising oil prices, but also the depreciation of the currency in the 1980s. The decline in
import demand in the 1970s and 1980s is consistent with these trends in relative prices.
The rise in import demand during the 1960s is also consistent with the gradual reduction
in collection rates during this period.8 Relative prices then fall steadily through the mid
8

There was also an important shift in the 1960s and 1970s towards capital intensive imports in response to
the import substitution policies that reduced the demand for imported consumer goods. In contrast to
consumer goods, imports of capital goods rose sharply during the 1970s in response to the large capital-

21

1990s and then rise again over the late 1990s in response to the depreciation. There is
also a noteworthy convergence in the two relative price series in the 1990s which is what
we would expect with liberalization. Between 1986 and 1992 the rand appreciated and
helps explain the price movement, but the rand depreciated from 1992 to 1996 and during
this period trade liberalization is probably the reason for declining import producer prices
as well as some of the recovery in import demand during this period. Finally, the slow
down in import demand around 1999 to 2001 is well explained by the depreciation of the
rand which raised the relative price of imports.

Overall, there appears to be a consistent relationship between import volumes and
GDP, investment, protection and relative prices. In what follows we report on a number
of quarterly regressions we have used to account for the behavior of import volumes. We
also pay attention to differences in the import content of various components of
expenditure, particularly investment expenditure. Given that faster South African growth
will require an increase in investment, the average expenditure elasticity could
underestimate the import needs if ASGI-SA is to be successful.
intensive investment made in iron & steel and industrial chemicals (Fallon and Pereira de Silva, 1994). The
decline in collection rates during the 1960s and early 1970s may therefore reflect a composition effect,
rather than a reduction in protection.

Econometric Estimation of Import Functions
We have estimated a conventional import demand equation:
LM = δ0 + δ1L(Pm/Pdom) + δ3LGDE + δ4Ltariff (δ1 < 0, δ3 > 0, δ4 < 0) (1)
where Pm, Pdom, GDE and tariff are the import price, domestic price, real gross
domestic expenditure and tariff rates, respectively. The prefix L represents the natural
logarithm. Import demand (M) is positively affected by rising domestic prices and real
domestic expenditure, but is negatively affected by rising import prices and tariffs.
Import prices (Pm) can rise either through a depreciation of the exchange rate or a rise in
foreign prices. We also estimate this function with GDE split into its various subcomponents.9 These include household and government expenditure, gross domestic
fixed capital formation (GDFI) by type of asset (residential buildings, non-residential
buildings, construction works, transport equipment and machinery and other equipment)
and by economic activity (Electricity, water and gas; Transport, storage and
communication; Community, social and personal services).
We estimate the import relationship over the period 1962 through 2004 using
quarterly data obtained from the Reserve Bank. We find that the relevant data are nonstationary and follow the Johansen procedure to estimate the long-run relationship within
a vector error correction (VECM) framework (Johansen, 1988; Johansen and Juselius,
1990).10
We report later the impact of different expenditure patterns but let us focus on a
specification in which expenditure is divided into government consumption plus
household expenditure (LCT) and total fixed capital formation (LGDFITOT). The
estimation is repeated using the two different measures of relative prices: Log of import
For example, we substitute δ3LGDE = δ3L(CT+G) with δ5LCT + δ6LI where CT is total consumption
(household plus government) and I is investment. Note that δ5+δ6 does not necessarily equal δ3. Further, if
the equation with GDE disaggregated into its constituent parts is the correct specification, then
specifications using aggregated GDE will yield biased estimates of the expenditure elasticity.

unit values to manufacturing PPI (PMUV/PMAN) and log of import PPI to
manufacturing PPI (PPIM/PMAN). The estimated long run relationships are:
Result 1: Using Import unit value/PPI manufacturing as relative price
LM = - 0.877*PMUV/PMAN - 0.369*LTARSURP + 0.749*LCT + 0.229*LGDFITOT
ecm1(-1) = -.337 , T-Ratio = -3.65 [0.000] 11
Result 2: Using PPI import/PPI manufacturing as relative price
LM = - 1.724*PPIM/PMAN + 0.00*LTARSURP + 0.653*LCT + 0.315*LGDFITOT
ecm1(-1) = -.275 , T-Ratio = -3.76 [0.000] 12
The estimated responsiveness of import volumes to overall economic activity is
quite similar in these two equations with the coefficients of household, government and
investment expenditure summing up close to one in both cases. In the Appendix A1 we
provide a summary of the results of other studies on South African import demand which
find income elasticity estimates ranging from 0.43 to 2.2. Hence, our results are in line
with these studies. The estimated import elasticity for household and government
expenditure (0.65 to 0.75) exceeds that of total investment (0.23 to 0.31), but this
comparison does not account for the relatively large share of expenditure accounted for
by the former (approximately 84% of gross domestic expenditure). According to the first
result, a one percent growth in GDE that stems from consumption and investment leads to
increases of 1.04 and 1.36 percent in imports, respectively. In equation two the increases
would be 0.90 and 1.83 percent for consumption and investment respectively.13
Therefore, economic growth led by investment is expected to have far more serious

implications for the balance of payments than consumption-led growth. We explore this
in more depth later.
The long-run price elasticities in the literature, which range from -0.53 to -1.56 ,
are in line with our estimates using relative import unit values (-0.877) but below those
using import producer prices. The coefficient on the relative imports prices of 1.72 is
much larger than the coefficient on relative import unit values and higher than found in
most other studies. At the same time the coefficient on the tariff variable is zero in the
second equation when the relative import price variable is used whereas it is -.39 in the
first equation. These results are exactly what we might expect since the second equation
already captures the impact of tariff changes in the price variable, i.e. there is no
additional explanatory power over and above the effect via domestic prices. Further, if
unit value changes are not passed through proportionally into the domestic prices of
imported goods as we might expect with non-tariff barriers and specific and formula
tariffs for example, we would expect relatively smaller responses in the estimates of unit
value changes. However, the coefficient certainly suggests that real exchange rates and
other shifts in relative import prices will have substantial effects on import volumes and
values.
These equations can also be used to allow us to decompose import behavior over
the period, into its explanatory components.

Together Table 5 and Table 6 allow us to tell a coherent story about import growth. The
1960s (1962-69) are a period of very robust growth in imports. This growth was actually
suppressed by relative price behavior and moderately boosted by trade liberalization. The
dominant source of import growth was the very rapid increases in consumption and
particularly in investment.
In the 1970s, imports barely grew. While income growth was fairly rapid, rising
relative import prices played the key role in suppressing imports. This is not really
captured in the tariff collections variable, or until the end of the 1970s, in the real
exchange of the rand.14 This was a period in which global prices of tradable goods grew
particularly rapidly and more rapidly than domestic prices.
In the 1980s import demand remained stagnant in response to declining
investment and increases in surcharges imposed in response to the balance of payments
crisis after the mid-1980s. The effect of increased protection is sizeable, reducing import
growth by 3.2% per annum over this period.
In the recent period, (90s to 2004) the big story is again trade policy. Over the
period as a whole, relative prices do little to explain import growth. In other words the
exchange rate and international price shifts do not play a major role. Trade liberalization
14

The decomposition does not adequately capture the effect of surcharges imposed from 1977 which
peaked in 1978. This explains why the estimated export growth in the 1970s exceeded actual export
growth.

26

South Africa Growth Initiative

South African Trade Policy Matters

accounts for over half the import growth in this period increasing import demand 2.9%
per annum. Income growth, including a modest recovery in investment, explains the rest.
The decomposition using relative import prices (Table 7) does not provide
separate effects for trade policy, instead ascribing all import behavior to prices and
activity. But it gives a very similar story. With relative import price behavior the key to
why import growth reflected income growth in the 1960s, and failed to reflect it in the
1970s. This equation does poorly in predicting imports in the 1980s when it appears that
protectionist trade policies were operational but accurately explains imports in the recent
period as a response to relative import prices.

Income elasticities: Some Implications for ASGI-SA.
The regression results can also provide some insight into the implications for
import demand arising from the ASGI-SA growth targets. Our import elasticity when
using aggregate Gross Domestic Expenditure is 0.69, which falls on the low side of
comparable studies conducted for South Africa (see Table A3 in appendix). However,
once we decompose GDE into its constituent parts, we find that the various components
of expenditure do not have uniform effects on import demand, with investment growth
relatively more import intensive than household and government consumption. The
implication for the ASGI-SA growth target is clearly reflected in Table 8 where we use
the average expenditure elasticities from regressions 1 and 2 to estimate import growth
arising from various combinations of growth in consumption and investment that equate
to 8% growth in GDE. This growth in GDE corresponds with the GDP growth of close to
27

6% that occurred 1962 to 1969 and is hence a good reference for expected growth in the
future.

From 1962-69, GDP grew at 5.8% per annum.

Depending on the composition of GDE growth, import growth ranges from 6.5% to
13.6%. The primary implication that we can draw from the table is that the 6% growth in
GDP foreseen by ASGI-SA will result in a growth of imports in excess of 6%. Such
import growth will therefore require growth in exports in excess of 6% in order to
maintain the current account balance.15
We also estimate a number of import functions with gross domestic fixed capital
formation disaggregated into its sub-components. These results are presented in Table 9.
In all cases, imports are sensitive to relative prices, tariffs and household and government
consumption. Looking at result 3, investment in non-residential buildings are found to
raise imports, but investment in residential buildings and machinery and equipment
provide no additional explanatory power over an above the other variables. Transport
equipment has the incorrect sign and could possibly be explained by the development of
the motor vehicle industry under a protective environment. When analyzing investment
according to Economic activity (results 4 to 6), we find that investment by the transport,

more than a proportionate increase in exports.

storage and communication sector and community and personal services sector have
relatively large impacts on import demand. In all cases, a 1 percent increase in investment
and household plus government consumption raises import demand by at least 1 percent.

Section III: Explaining Exports:
Let us turn then to exports, focusing first on non-commodity manufactured good
exports. Figure 7depicts the volume of non-commodity manufactured goods exports and
the real effective exchange rate which is inverted (1/REER) so that real depreciation of
the Rand shows as an upward movement in the series that would be expected to exert a
positive influence on exports. In the first part of the period, from 1970 to 1978, the real
rand does not change much and neither do exports. But what is striking is the
sluggishness in export performance when the rand appreciates through 1983, depreciates
through 1986 and then gradually appreciates through 1991. To be sure there is some
export growth between 1986 and 1988 which could be a lagged response to the earlier
rand depreciation, but the exchange rate is clearly of little help in accounting for the rapid
acceleration of exports between 1991 and 1997.

movements in the relative price of manufactured goods and unit labor costs relative to the
producer prices which are used in the real exchange rate measure. Through 1980 this
series suggest a marked improvement in export profitability in the late 1970s and then a
decline through 1983 that is associated with the stronger Rand, but in neither case is
there much response in export volumes. Thereafter, however, the unit labor cost variable
does provide some assistance in explaining responses. The improvement in the export
profitability measure associated with the Rand decline in the mid 1980s is greater and
longer lasting than in the real exchange rate and does add support to the notion that
improved profitability helped to spur the export response between 1986 and 1988. There
is again more improvement in export profitability between 1993 and 1997 than in the
Rand’s movement – again contributing to the explanation for the strong growth in exports
during this period -- and an even greater improvement in export profitability through
2002. Thus the cost variables appear to operate effectively in driving these exports since
the late 1980s whereas responses are extremely small prior to that.
The missing piece in the puzzle though is trade policy. Exporters rely heavily on
inputs, both imported and domestic and particularly when it comes to deciding which
markets to serve. The relative profitability of exports to domestic sales will also exert
some influence. Accordingly the trade regime can have an independent impact on
performance. For the period since 1988 we have computed a number of series that we
will explore in depth in what follows. But first, for illustrative purposes we will use the
ratio of tariff collections, inclusive of surcharges, to the value of imports as a measure of
the restrictiveness of trade policy. While the variable (TARSURP) does a reasonable job
of tracking scheduled tariff rates in the recent period (Edwards, 2005), as we have already
noted, given the very extensive use of non-tariff measures, and the fact that by
discouraging (or eliminating) imports, restrictive tariffs could reduce rather than increase
the ratio of tariff collections to imports there is undoubtedly a downward bias in this
measure. We have rebased this measure so that 2000 = 100 and express its inverse so that
positive movements should be associated with faster export growth and liberalization.

Consider Figure 8 which reports non-commodity exports, the real exchange rate,
export profitability and this inverted measure of tariff collections. Recalling that
downward movement indicates a movement towards protection, the tariff variable reflects
volatility in trade policy in the 1970s: with movement towards liberalization through
1976 protection through 1978 and liberalization through 1980. In the mid 1980s
associated with the decline in the rand, there is a movement towards greater protection
through the use of import surcharges and all told the variable suggests a trend towards
greater protection. Thus trade policy offset some of the potential stimulatory impact of
the improvements in export profitability both in the mid 1970s and especially in the mid
1980s.

One of the particular strange features of South African export performance was the
relatively sluggish response in exports to the massive depreciations of the rand in the
mid-1980s. However, if the implicit export taxes between 1985 and 1989 increased by a
similar proportion as the duties collection, this would suggest that it was increased by an
effective rate of about 16 percentage points i.e. from 20 to 36 percent. Thus while the
rapid growth in export prices improved the profitability of exporting, this effect was
apparently partially offset by more expensive input prices.

32

By contrast, in the more recent period, liberalization has had a marked impact in
stimulating exports. In 1989 tariff collection revenues amounted to 11 percent of the
value of imports. They fell fairly steadily until reaching a level of about 4 percent in
1998. The drop in the import-weighted effective rate of protection was significantly
larger – from 35.6 percent in 1989 to 14 percent in 2000. Given this opening up of the
economy, the import growth was quite understandable, but what is particularly interesting
over the same period, is the rapid export growth – indeed over the ten year period export
and import volumes increased at similar rates. The take off and rapid growth of South
African non-commodity exports between 1992 and 2000 is not really well tracked by the
measures of export profitability and the real exchange rate but the fit with the
liberalization variable is remarkable.

Commodity exports16
Here we report both real exchange rate profitability measures together. The two
commodity price booms are evident in the data for the 1970s. There is no Dutch disease
associated with the first boom in commodity prices. It is not the case that strong
commodity prices in 1973 and 1974 lead to a real appreciation of the Rand. But in
response to the second boom and the soaring price of gold, the Rand does appreciate and
the profitability of commodity production is depressed. In response commodities exports
flatten. The Rand’s decline between 1983 and 1987 improves profitability and exports
respond. Growth in exports is particularly rapid between 1992 and 1998 as is the
improvement in profitability – but what is striking is that there is no growth between
2000 and 2003 despite the dramatic improvement in profitability. Nonetheless with the
interesting exception of the recent period, the broad impression is that commodities
export behavior has been responsive to relative profitability.

Non-gold commodity exports include both primary and manufactured commodity goods.

Aggregate export regressions
To analyze the determinants of South African export performance, we estimate a
simple reduced form export function derived from an imperfect substitution model
(Goldstein and Kahn, 1985; Edwards and Alves, 2006): 17

(

)

X = λ0 + λ1 e + P ∗ − λ2 P − λ3T + λ3Y ∗ + πZ , λi > 0

(2)

where (all variables in logs):
X

= volume of exports

Y*

= real foreign income

P*

= foreign producer price

e

= domestic to foreign currency exchange rate

P

= domestic producer price

T

= tariff rates

17

For the full derivation of this relationship see the data appendix available from
http://www.commerce.uct.ac.za/Economics/staff/ledwards/research.asp. This specification has a number of
advantages. Firstly, homogeneity of degree zero in prices implies that λ1+λ2=0, in which case the foreign
price in Rands (e+P*) and the domestic price (P) can be combined to form the Real Effective Exchange
rate (P-e-P*). Secondly, in the case of a small price-taking economy, the reduced form equation effectively
becomes the export supply equation, where the coefficient on (e+P*) reflects the elasticity of export
supply.

= vector of other real variables that influence the supply of exports.
Export volumes are positively affected by foreign income (Y*) and the price of

competing foreign goods, measured in Rands (e +P*), but are negatively affected by
rising domestic prices (P) and tariffs (T). The domestic price index captures two effects.
Firstly, domestic and imported goods are imperfect substitutes. A rise in the domestic
price, given constant export prices, causes exporters to shift production away from the
export market towards the domestic market. Secondly, domestic prices are also a proxy
for production costs. Rising production costs reduce the profitability of export production
and hence reduce export volumes. Similarly, tariff protection (T) reduces exports by
raising the cost of production thereby reducing profits, and raising the relative
profitability of supplying the domestic market as opposed to the international market. Z is
a vector of other variables that affect export supply and may include capacity utilization,
infrastructure constraints and proxies for export potential.
A limitation in the estimation of the export relationship, however, is that domestic
prices are themselves a function of foreign prices, measured in domestic currency, tariff
rates and other variables.18 As found in the import demand equations using PPI imports,
tariffs may have no additional impact on exports over and above their effect through
domestic prices (i.e. λ3=0). To identify the impact of tariffs on prices, we specify an open
economy price relationship as

P = β 0 + β 1T + β 2 (e + P*) + β ′V , β i > 0

(3)

where V is a vector of other factors such as excess demand, transport costs , regulations,
monetary policy, etc. that influence prices.
Including a price equation such as (3) has of number of implications for the
interpretation of the reduced form export coefficients. The coefficient on Tariffs (λ3) in
the export equation is the marginal impact on export volumes, over and above the effect it

18

The exchange rate may also be endogenous. Export growth leads to a trade surplus, which in turn may
cause the currency to appreciate. We ignore this relationship in the discussion below, although in the
estimates provided, we allow for the endogeneity of the exchange rate.

35

has on domestic prices and may equal zero if the effect of tariffs is fully captured via
domestic prices (λ2). The coefficient on the nominal exchange rate and foreign price
variable (λ1) is also not the long-run impact on export volumes. If the pass-through of
exchange rate depreciation (or foreign price increases) to domestic prices is high (β2 is
close to 1) then the positive effect of a nominal depreciation on export volumes will be
eroded by price inflation.
In estimating the export relationship, we therefore attempt to estimate both
equation (2) and (3) in order to derive the net effect of exchange rate shocks and tariffs on
export volumes. We analyze aggregate export performance in South Africa using nongold merchandise exports (South African Reserve Bank quarterly Bulletin) and
manufacturing exports (Quantec, 2005). Manufacturing exports are also divided into
commodity manufactures and non-commodity manufactures using the classification
presented in Appendix Table A1. The manufacturing trade data are only available in
annual format over the period 1970 – 2004. Non-gold merchandise exports are available
in quarterly and annual data over the period 1961:1-2004:3. We follow the Johansen
procedure and estimate the long-run relationship within a vector error correction (VECM)
framework (Johansen, 1988; Johansen and Juselius, 1990).19
In estimating the long-run relationships, we also include a number of additional
stationary variables to those specified in the export equations above. These additional
variables include a measure of the GDP gap, two oil shock dummies (1974-78, 1979-85),
a dummy for the post-1994 period, a sanctions dummy (1986-1992), seasonal dummies
and a dummy variable for the exchange rate shock in 2001/02.20
The estimated long-run relationships for aggregate non-gold merchandise exports
are presented in Table 10. The long-run relationships for total manufacturing exports and
the two sub-groupings, commodity and non-commodity manufactures, are presented in
Table 11. In the tables, LPPIQSA is SA domestic PPI, LPPIFRAND is foreign PPI in

Our functions appear to be well specified with coefficients falling with the range

specified as the export equation, the other of which is specified as the price equation. In
all export relationships we cannot reject the restriction that the absolute value of the
coefficients on LPPIFRAND and LPPIQSA are equal, implying that the coefficient on
these variables is the real exchange rate elasticity.
Looking at the long-run export and price relationships for non-gold merchandise
exports over the period 1975q1 to 2004q3, we find that non-gold merchandise exports are
sensitive, but not highly so, to changes in the real effective exchange rate. A 1 % real

37

depreciation reduces exports by 0.64% in long run. This coefficient is similar to those
found for South Africa by Fallon and Pereira da Silva (1994); Smal (1996) and Senhadji
and Montenegro (1998), but more inelastic than those (below -1) found by Tsikata (1999)
and Edwards and Golub (2004).
Domestic prices are sensitive to tariff protection and the Rand value of foreign
prices. We find a relatively high degree of pass-through of international prices and the
exchange rate to domestic producer prices. A 1 % rise in aggregate foreign prices
resulting from a depreciation or foreign inflation raises aggregate domestic producer
prices by 0.85% in the long-run. The pass-through of foreign prices and the exchange rate
to domestic prices appears large relative to inflation studies such as Nell (2000), Aron et
al. (2004), Kaseeram et al. (2004) and Fedderke and Schaling (2005) whose estimates
range from 0.2 to 0.6. However, the pass-through is less than the perfect pass-through
estimated by Jonsson (1999) who also estimates a purchasing power parity relationship
for South Africa between 1970 and 1998.
The implication of this result is that a nominal depreciation does not lead to a
substantial real depreciation in the long-run, a result that is consistent with findings by
Aron et al. (2000) in their estimation of the REER. The adjustment to this long-run
relationship, however, is slow. According to the adjustment term in the error correction
model for PPI, only 5% of the deviation from long-run equilibrium is ‘corrected’ in the
subsequent period.
The high pass-through of exchange rate shocks to domestic prices has important
implications for the long-run impact on export volumes. Although a nominal depreciation
raises the profitability of export supply (and may reduce the dollar price of SA exports),
most of these gains are eroded by higher domestic prices. According to the results of the
export and price relationship, the long-run impact of a 1% depreciation of the nominal
exchange rate on export volumes is only 0.1% ((1-0.85)*0.64).

38

Our estimates above suggest that tariffs have no direct effect on exports, but
indirectly affect exports through their impact on domestic prices or costs. In the long run
a 1% rise in tariffs raises domestic prices by 0.48%. This in turn reduces the profitability
(both relative and absolutely) of export supply and hence lowers export volumes by
0.31% (0.48*0.64). This estimate of the responsiveness of exports to tariffs is slightly
lower than the estimate (-0.86) of Tsikata (1999). Finally, we estimate a foreign income
elasticity of 1.05, which falls in the middle of the range estimated in existing studies on
South Africa.21

for non-gold merchandise exports. The difference reflects a relatively low price
responsiveness of non-gold primary exports.
Interestingly, non-commodity exports are found to be less sensitive to the REER
than commodity exports, although the difference is not statistically significant. We find
significant differences in the impact of foreign income on exports. Foreign income raises
exports of non-commodity manufactures (elasticity = 1.31), but not commodity
manufactures. This insignificance of foreign income for commodity exports is consistent
with the small-country model, where exporters are price takers in the international
market. Commodity manufactures are characterized by relatively little product
differentiation; hence firms have little market power to adjust prices from world prices. In
contrast, non-commodity manufactures may be characterized by greater product
differentiation and therefore market power. The positive impact of foreign income on
non-commodity exports may also reflect the growth in markets for new product varieties.
As found for non-gold merchandise exports, tariffs negatively affect exports
through their impact on domestic prices. Using the long-run relationships, a 1% rise in
tariffs reduces export volumes by 0.8% (non-commodity manufactures) and 0.9%
(commodity manufactures)
In all estimates for manufacturing, we find close to perfect pass-through of
foreign prices (measured in Rands) to domestic prices in the long-run. The implication, as
discussed above, is that a nominal depreciation does not raise real exports in the long-run
as the improved profitability of export production is eroded by domestic inflation over
time.22
In conclusion, we find empirical results consistent with our graphical analysis of
South Africa export performance. Tariff protection negatively affects exports, a real
22

The relatively slow adjustment of domestic prices to long-run equilibrium, however, suggests that the
nominal depreciation may result in a short-run export response. Further, a nominal appreciation of the Rand
will have a significant negative impact on the profitability of export supply in the short-run, as input costs
are slow to adjust in response to the appreciation. If domestic prices are sticky downwards, we may find an
asymmetric response to a rise or fall in the exchange rate.

exchange rate depreciation has a positive impact on export volumes, and finally nominal
exchange rate shocks have a small effect on exports in the long-run, as domestic price
increases erode the improved profitability of export supply.

Section IV: Export Taxes.
Let us consider in greater depth how trade policy has affected performance in the
period of liberalization. Tariffs affect export performance in two ways. Firstly, tariffs
raise the price of intermediate inputs and therefore reduce the profitability of export
production. Secondly, nominal tariffs raise the relative return to production for the
domestic market causing firms to shift production out of the export market and into the
domestic market. If these variables have a significant impact on trade flows – and we will
show below that they do –this implies that it is not simply factor endowments that are
responsible for the patterns of export specialization we find in South Africa. In fact,
policy has contributed to the patterns.
Table 12 below reports estimates of the effective rates of protection, export taxes
(i.e. tariffs on inputs weighted by input shares as a share of value added in world prices)
and a measure of anti-export bias which captures the impact of the scheduled tariffs both
in raising export costs and in creating an incentive to service the domestic market i.e (1 +
ERP) / (1 –XTAX). 23 Industry estimates are then weighted according to their 1990 trade
shares to obtain aggregates for manufactured commodities and non-commodities. These
estimates produce some interesting results.
First, in 1989 the average effective rates of protection were remarkably high -45.8 for commodities, 42 for other manufacturing and somewhat lower for primary
commodities. With respect to export taxes, however, the picture is different. Partly
because non-commodity manufacturing firms are more reliant on inputs from other firms
both in their own sector and elsewhere, the impact of tariffs on their costs appears to be
substantially greater than for producers of manufactured commodities. Indeed in 1989,
the estimated export taxes on non-commodity manufacturing -- at 52 percent -- were

Values of the anti-export bias in excess of 1 reflect relatively high returns in the domestic market compared

twice as high as those commodity manufactured exports. Taking account of both effects,
in the anti-export bias measure, therefore shows an anti export bias that is far higher at
2.96 than that for commodities.

Over the next fourteen years there was major trade liberalization which actually reduced
the effective rate of protection, and therefore value added, for commodity manufacturers
(23%) by more than non-commodities (18%).24 The impact of liberalization since 1989 in
reducing export taxes on non-commodity manufactures has by contrast, been significantly
larger than the impact on commodity manufactures. The effect of these reductions is
equivalent to an improvement in export profitability of 60% for non-commodity
manufacturing, compared to 24% for commodity manufacturing.25 Overall, therefore, the
reduction in anti-export bias from 2.96 to 1.52 was twice as high for non-commodity
manufacturing as the reduction from 1.99 to 1.24 for commodity manufacturing and
contributes to the explanation of why the growth in the volume of non-commodity
manufactures ( up 184 percent) is significantly higher than in commodity manufacturers
(up 44 percent). In fact, the special programs for automobiles and textiles which are not
captured in these data suggest an even greater role for trade policy in this outcome –
24

These percentages reflect the change in value added arising from the decline in ERP and are calculated as
Change in VAERP = ∆ERP/(1+ERP)
25
The improvement in export profitability is calculated as Change in VAXTAX = ∆XTAX/(1-XTAX).

although on the other hand the ending of the General Export Incentive Scheme (GEIS)
program moves in the opposite direction. Nonetheless, although significant liberalization
has taken place, it still appears to be the case that South Africa’s trade policy hinders its
export performance overall and that the impact on non-commodity manufacturing is
relatively higher than on manufacturing.

Figure 10 captures the relationships between export volumes and the inverted
export tax variable for all manufactured products. There is a very strong correlation
between the export tax variable and manufactured goods export volumes. By contrast up
until 1997 neither the real exchange rate nor the ratio of export prices to unit labor costs
which moves with it help explain the export surge. To be sure, there could be some
contribution that comes from better tracking of exports and the impact of ending
apartheid on exports to Africa but nonetheless the relationship remains remarkable and,
as we now show, is both statistically and quantitatively significant.

Panel export regressions
To estimate the relationship between export performance and trade policy, we use
a panel of 44 manufacturing sectors over the period 1990-2002. We use as our dependent
variable the ratio of exports to domestic production. As our independent variables we
specify separately scheduled tariffs and surcharges, drawn from Edwards (2005). One
feature of the South African tariff regime was that tariff protection was granted not
simply through ad valorem tariffs but in many cases with specific tariffs, compound
tariffs, mixed tariffs and formula duties. The latter provided additional protection if the
world price fell below a specified reference price. An important component of
liberalization was the simplification and increased transparency of the tariff schedule
achieved largely through a reduction in the use of non-ad valorem rates. Accordingly, we
add in a variable which captures reductions in the complexity of the South Africa tariff
schedule -- the proportion of HS 8 digit tariffs within each sector that are ad valorem.
Since increases in this proportion represent greater liberalization, we would expect a
positive coefficient in the regression.
In addition, we include a relative cost variable designed to capture the profitability
of selling in the domestic market, the ratio of the nominal exchange rate to the domestic
producer price index. We would expect that a depreciation would raise the relative price
of exports and thus expect a positive coefficient on this variable. We also insert dummies
to capture sector- and time- fixed effects, a trend term and a number of controls the
capital labor ratio and the skill share.
Table 13 and Table 14 explore the impacts of scheduled tariffs, effective rates of
protection and export taxes separately. We also divide the sample into commodities and
non-commodities. All three of the variables have the expected negative effects on
exports as a whole, but although the relationships show up in the sample that includes all
sectors, they are more significant in non-commodities than commodities. The tariff,
effective rate of protection and export tax variables all indicate a statistically significant
negative impact on non-commodities exports. The ‘transparency’ of the tariff structure, as
measured by the share of HS 8-digit tariff lines with ad valorem rates, is also an
45

important determinant of export performance of non-commodities, but comes in with the
wrong sign with commodities. In addition, non-commodities respond significantly and
elastically to the real exchange rate variable with an elasticity around 2. Commodities
manufacturing are less responsive to relative prices and are overall not well explained by
the regression. The nominal tariff coefficient is of correct sign, but insignificant. The
coefficients on the surcharges and share ad valorem rates are incorrectly signed.

In the next table (Table 15) we use both export tax and protection measures
together. For all sectors tariffs (but not export taxes) have a negative and significant
impact on exports, but while the nominal tariff is negative it is not significant and in this
regression it is export taxes and the ad valorem share that are significant.
These results lend strong support to the proposition that trade policies were partly
responsible for South Africa’s weak manufacturing export performance, particularly
during the 1970s and 1980s. Not only did the trade regime penalize non-commodity
exports more than commodities but since non-commodity supplies are relatively more
responsive to these penalties, the impact of these policies was magnified. The growth in
exports, particularly non-commodity manufactures, during the 1990s is in large part due
to the reduction in the anti-export bias brought about through tariff liberalization.

Implications for factor demand.
It is apparent that commodity manufacturing is distinctive not only because it
embodies primary inputs but also because it is highly capital intensive. Indeed this is
clear whether we measure capital intensity by the ratio of capital (gross fixed capital
stock) to value-added or the ratio of capital to labor (Table 16). And as Table 17 indicates
there is a high correlation between commodity and capital intensity. It is also interesting
that commodity manufactures are not unskilled- labor- intensive.
Alleyne and Subramanian (2001) undertook a decomposition of the factor content
of South African trade and found paradoxically that it reflected patterns of specialization
in capital intensive products. They argued that since South Africa has a relative
abundance of unskilled labor, this specialization in capital intensity indicated that South
Africa has a highly distorted labor market that artificially raises labor costs. But our
analysis suggests that South African export policy has been particularly unfavorable to
manufactured goods and relatively favorable to manufactured commodities. This leads us

48

South Africa Growth Initiative

to suggest, that the bias towards capital intensity may tell us more (or as much) about
South African trade policy as it does about the South African labor market.

Section V: Explaining the trade balance
Our analysis thus far indicates that trade liberalization has both raised exports and
imports during the 1990s. The net effect on the trade balance, however, is ambiguous.
Multi-country studies of developing countries in general find that trade liberalization
worsens the trade balance (UNCTAD, 1999; Santos-Paulino and Thirlwall, 2004). In this
section, we estimate the determinants of the manufacturing trade balance over the 1990s
using the panel of 44 manufacturing industries over the period 1990-2002.
We estimate the following function:
TBit = µ i + β 1TARit + β 2 ADVALORit + β 3 RERit + β 4VOLit + δ ′D + λ t + ε it
where TB is the trade balance measured as ln(export value/import value) TAR is a
measure of tariff protection (As before, we explore the impact of scheduled tariff rates,
surcharges, the effective rate of protection and implicit export taxes), ADVALOR is the
measure of the complexity of the tariff schedule (the proportion of HS 8 digit tariffs
within each sector that are ad valorem), RER is the relative price index calculated as the
SA PPI relative to US PPI price (measured in common currency), and VOL is an index of
domestic production per sector. In addition to these variables, we include sector fixed
effects (µi) and time fixed effects (λt). These are included to account for time invariant
sector effects and sector invariant time effects. The latter are expected to capture the
effect of changes in gross domestic expenditure and other exogenous shocks that affect
all sectors equally. In this case, particularly the end of Apartheid. No time trend is
included (it was insignificant in all regressions). We also estimate the trade balance
relationship for all manufacturing sectors, commodity manufactures and non-commodity
manufactures.
This specification advances the literature in a number of ways. Firstly, unlike
many of the multi-country studies that use dummy variables for the liberalization period
(Bleaney, 1999; UNCTAD, 1999; Santos-Paulino and Thirlwall, 2004), we explicitly
account for changes in protection through the use of the direct measures of protection at

50

South Africa Growth Initiative

South African Trade Policy Matters

the sector level.26 Secondly, we estimate the Trade Balance relationship using a panel of
sector level data. Trade liberalization has a non-uniform effect on exports and imports
across sectors. We attempt to account for this heterogeneity through the use of sector
fixed effects as well as estimates of the trade balance equation for sub-groupings of
manufacturing. Finally, we are able to provide separate estimates of the effects of a
variety of measures of tariff reform on the trade balance. These include measures of
nominal protection, effective protection, and indicator of the complexity of the tariff
schedule, surcharges and the implicit tax on exports arising from protection on
intermediate inputs.
The results of the analysis are presented in Table 18 and Table 19. In the first
table, we present estimates of the trade balance relationship using measures of both
nominal tariff protection and effective protection. In the second table, we present
estimates using our measure of the implicit tax of tariffs on exports and both nominal
tariffs and export taxes. In the latter estimate we attempt to identify whether nominal
output tariffs and export taxes have differing effects on the trade balance.

The dummy variables capture the joint effect of a number of other policy and economic changes that
usually accompany trade reform (currency appreciations, instability resulting from capital-account
liberalisation, impact of trade liberalisation) and also fail to adequately measure the pace or extent of
liberalisation.

Notes: as above

These results indicate that a depreciation of the bilateral real exchange rate (RER)
vis-à-vis the USA improves the trade balance. In most of specifications, a 1 percent
depreciation is estimated to raise the value of non-commodity exports relative to noncommodity imports by approximately 0.7 percent. However, we find no such relationship
for commodity exports where the coefficient has the wrong (positive) sign, although it is
mostly insignificant. This could be due to the fact that there is reverse causation with the
rise in commodity exports leading to an appreciation of the Rand.27
Looking at our various measures of protection, we find a large positive and
significant impact of surcharges on the manufacturing trade balance in all regressions.
However, higher nominal output tariffs, effective protection rates and the implicit tax on
exports all worsen the trade balance. The coefficients on each of these variables are
significant in the case of non-commodity manufactures. For commodities, though, these
coefficients are not significant. Our results when including both the export tax and the
nominal output tariff in the regression (Table 19) suggest that the improvement in the

27

See Bell et al. (1999) on changes in the commodity composition of manufacturing in response to
commodity price cycles.

52

South Africa Growth Initiative

South African Trade Policy Matters

trade balance for non-commodities is primarily driven by a reduction in the implicit tax
on exports, rather than changes in the tariff on output. When all manufacturing sectors are
included, though, the opposite is the case and it is higher nominal tariffs that lead to a
declining trade balance. These results starkly contrast the multi-country studies of
developing countries by UNCTAD (1999) and Santos-Paulino and Thirlwall (2004).
Rather than worsening the trade balance, our results suggest that the stimulus to noncommodity export growth from liberalization exceeded the increase in imports. In sum,
we not only find that trade liberalization stimulates sectoral exports but that it also boosts
the sectoral balance of trade.
These results may seem surprising, but they are quite in line with the findings of
Edwards (2001) that on balance, changes in trade flows had very small effects on
employment in the 1990s and with the data on the ratio of trade balances to total output in
manufacturing reflected in Table 20 below.

Conclusions
If South Africa is to boost its investment relative to GDP, as called for under its
ASGI-SA program, this paper concludes that at constant exchange rates, import growth is
likely to outpace output growth. Absent an adequate availability of foreign capital or
continued improvements in the terms of trade, policies to switch expenditures from
foreign to domestic output and increase national saving could well be required.

53

South Africa Growth Initiative

South African Trade Policy Matters

On average, a one percent increase in gross domestic expenditure leads to similar
growth in import demand. Each one percent increase in industrial production in the rest
of the world has a similar impact on South African non-commodity exports. But on the
import side, the mix of expenditure also matters. In particular, gross fixed investment is
about fifty percent more import-intensive than consumption expenditure. If South Africa
is to boost its investment relative to GDP, as called for under the ASGI-SA program,
import growth is likely to outpace output growth. Absent an adequate availability of
foreign capital or continued improvements in the terms of trade, policies to switch
expenditures from foreign to domestic output and increase national saving could well be
required. This paper explored trade policy as an expenditure switching instrument.
South African trade policy has exerted a major influence on the composition and
aggregate growth of trade. In the Apartheid period, trade protection seriously impeded
both exports and imports, and the economy depended on global commodity price trends
to avoid running into an external constraint. South Africa developed a comparative
advantage in capital-intensive primary and manufactured commodities partly because of
its natural resource endowments but also because the pattern of protection was
particularly detrimental to exports of non-commodity manufactured goods. High and
opaque tariffs seriously impeded export growth. When global commodity markets were
weak, in combination with declining gold exports, this seriously constrained aggregate
growth and dulled the response of exports to the weaker rand in the late 1980s. On the
other hand, surcharges were effective in reducing imports. By contrast, trade
liberalization in the 1990s not only increased imports but, by reducing both input costs
and the relative profitability of domestic sales, also boosted exports. Indeed, the growth
in non-commodity manufactured sectoral exports as a result of liberalization was actually
faster than sectoral imports.
In addition to tariffs, both non-commodity exports and aggregate imports are
responsive to changes in the real exchange rate. This evidence suggests, therefore, that
South African entrepreneurs are not inherently biased against exports but instead respond
rationally to the incentives that they face. It points to the importance of policies that

54

South Africa Growth Initiative

afford them access to inputs at world prices as well as a competitive real exchange rate. It
also suggests that additional trade liberalization could well be part of the strategy to
enhance export diversification – one of the goals of ASGI-SA.
