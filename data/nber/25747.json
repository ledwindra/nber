    "abstract": "\n\nReflexivity is the idea that investors\u2019 biased beliefs affect market outcomes and that market outcomes in turn affect investors\u2019 future biases. We develop a dynamic behavioral model of the credit cycle featuring this two-way feedback loop. Investors form beliefs about the likelihood of future defaults by extrapolating past defaults. Investor beliefs influence a firm\u2019s actual creditworthiness because the firm is less likely to default in the short run when it can issue debt on favorable terms. Our model matches many features of the credit cycle, including its imperfect synchronization with the real economy and the \u201ccalm before the storm\u201d phenomenon.\n\n",
