    "abstract": "\n\nStock return volatility during the Great Depression has been labeled a \u201cvolatility puzzle\u201d because the standard deviation of stock returns was two to three times higher than any other period in American history (Officer, 1973; Wilson, Sylla, and Jones; 1990). We investigate the \u201cvolatility puzzle\u201d using a new series of building permits, a forward-looking measure of economic activity. Our results suggest that the volatility of building permit growth largely explains the high level of stock volatility during the Great Depression. Markets factored in the possibility of a forthcoming economic disaster.\n\n",
