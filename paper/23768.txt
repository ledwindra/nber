Reproductive Health Care in Catholic-Owned Hospitals

NBER Working Paper No. 23768
September 2017, Revised February 2016
JEL No. J13,L31,Z12
ABSTRACT
Mergers that affiliate a hospital with a Catholic owner, network, or system reduce the set of
possible reproductive medical procedures since Catholic hospitals have strict prohibitions on
contraception. Using changes in ownership of hospitals, we find that Catholic hospitals reduce the
per bed rates of tubal ligations by 31%, whereas there is no significant change in related
permitted procedures such as Caesarian sections. However, across a variety of measures, we find
minimal overall welfare reductions. Still, fewer tubal ligations increase the risk of unintended
pregnancies across the United States, imposing a potentially substantial cost for less reliable
contraception on women and their partners.

1. Introduction
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has resulted in significant changes in hospital ownership, in part from
mergers and acquisitions. The figures are notable: 105 merger deals were reported in 2012 alone, an
increase from an average of 50 to 60 annually in the pre-ACA and pre-recession years of 2005–2007
(Dafny 2014). Catholic hospital systems have actively participated in this merger frenzy, with 120
mergers between Catholic and non-Catholic systems between 2001 and 2016 (Uttley and Khaikin 2016),
a fifteen-year growth rate of 22%. Four out of the top ten largest healthcare systems (and four of the top
five non-profit systems) were Catholic affiliated, and Catholic hospitals accounted for 14.5 percent of
all acute care hospitals and one in six acute care hospital beds in 2016 (Uttley and Khaikin 2016).
Ownership changes that affiliate a hospital with a Catholic owner, network, or system, are
consequential because they reduce the set of possible contraceptive medical procedures. Specifically,
the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ (USCCB) Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health
Care Services forbid sterilization procedures, contraceptives, in vitro fertilization and abortion at
Catholic health care facilities (USCCB 2009). As a result, a rise in mergers between Catholic and secular
hospitals and health systems over the past decade has drawn increased attention to the directives’ impact
on access to reproductive health care services at such facilities. For example, in October of 2015, the
American Civil Liberties Union sued Trinity Health (the second largest Catholic Health System that
owns 86 hospitals in 21 states) for not performing abortions when medically necessary. The lay press,
medical and legal journals have featured discussions about the impact of these ownership changes on
patient care, particularly with regard to reproductive health, such as abortions and sterilizations, and have
drawn attention to the $45 billion in federal funding these hospital systems receive each year (Catholics
for Choice 2005, National Women’s Law Center 2011, Abelson 2012, Mencimer 2013, Martin 2013,
Lee and Propublica 2016). This is in addition to other new restrictions on reproductive health care
services that proliferated over the past decade (Packham 2017, Quast et al. 2017, Fischer, Royer, and

2

White 2017, Cunningham et al. 2017, Bailey and Lindo 2018, Lu and Slusky 2016). Existing research
on the potential effect of Catholic ownership on patient care has relied on qualitative interviews of
patients and doctors (Rubin et al. 2006, Stulberg et al. 2014). This paper examines the effect of Catholic
affiliation on reproductive health procedures and finds significant reductions in tubal ligations.
To illuminate the potential consequences of Catholic owned hospitals, we examine the effect of
changes in ownership from secular to Catholic (and vice versa) on reproductive health procedures such
as tubal ligation, abortion, vasectomy, hysterectomy, and dilation and curettage (D&C) 1 that are likely
to be affected by Catholic ownership and banned under the USCCB Ethical and Religious Directives. 2
In particular, we investigate the following question: How does Catholic ownership affect the rates of
reproductive procedures restricted under the USCCB Directives? We hypothesize that changes to
Catholic ownership result in a reduction in the rates of these procedures. We also investigate how
Catholic affiliation of a hospital affects the fertility rate, women’s hospital choice, and complications
after miscarriage.
To test our hypothesis, we use the universe of hospitals in six states and compile publicly
available data on Catholic hospital mergers to identify hospitals that do not change location but change
ownership. We use within-hospital and across-patient variation to control for potential differences in
patient population across different types of hospitals, including a hospital fixed effect. In particular, our
study exploits changes in affiliation only (such changes are in name, administration, and affiliation) with
the hospital location unchanged. We use longitudinal data on hospital procedures to identify the causal
effect of Catholic ownership on reproductive health procedures, with a particular focus on tubal ligations.

1

Dilation and curettage, used to remove uterine tissue for a variety of reasons. Since the technique used can be similar to that
of an abortion, we only code D&C = 1 if the woman had a D&C but did not have an abortion on that discharge.
2

Despite abortion and vasectomy being primarily performed in an outpatient setting, we measure impacts on inpatient
procedures as those are available in our data and find suggestive evidence that the religious directives are also reducing
access to these procedures.

3

We find evidence that Catholic ownership of hospitals decreases the rate of tubal ligations by 30 percent.
We find suggestive evidence that vasectomies and abortions also decrease, but are rarely performed in
an inpatient setting, so these estimates are less precise. We do not find evidence that changes in Catholic
ownership are related to changes in the number of births, Caesarian sections, or miscarriages.
Anecdotal reports have suggested that Catholic hospitals are putting women in danger due to the
restrictions on miscarriage management. Contrary to these reports, we find some evidence that Catholic
ownership is in fact associated with a reduction in miscarriages that involve a complication, suggesting
that anecdotal accounts may not be indicative of a widespread pattern. Hysterectomies are another form
of female sterilization restricted by the USCCB Ethical and Religious Directives. We find a reduction in
hysterectomies among women of childbearing age, which is less precisely estimated but consistent with
the findings for tubal ligations. Hysterectomies are also performed in response to hemorrhage, so a
reduction may also be indicative of improved quality. That said, we do not find any evidence of a
decrease in severe maternal morbidity with Catholic ownership that would support an overall conclusion
of improved quality.
Current literature suggests that this growth in mergers and affiliation changes are part of a broader
trend in hospital consolidation likely driven by multiple factors such as economies of scale, financial
distress, desires to expand market power, and risk management strategies in response to health care
reform (Dafny 2014, Uttley and Khaikin 2016, Neprash et al. 2017). We test our identifying assumption
by estimating how changes in ownership affect the composition of reproductive patients, hospital
characteristics, and controlling for changes in unemployment in the county where the hospital is located.
We find some suggestive evidence that after a switch to Catholic ownership, hospitals may have a slight
increase in the share of reproductive patients that are Black and a slight increase in the number of beds,
though neither effect is precisely estimated. When we control for these characteristics in our main

4

specification, the results are consistent. Our results are also robust to the inclusion of the county
unemployment rate.
There may be national trends in use of these reproductive procedures that are concurrent with
our study period. Data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) from 1980 to 2014 reflect a
fairly steady rate of female sterilization (i.e., tubal ligation) of 27.5 percent for all women and 37.8
percent for married women nationally (Bailey and Lindo 2018). This rate has started to decline somewhat
after 2010 with the introduction of Long Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARC) such as IUDs. These
data suggest that in the latter part of our study period, there could be secular trends reducing the use of
tubal ligation. According to these national survey data, the most prevalent and persistent use of tubal
ligation is among women aged 35-44; thus, we also stratify our estimates by age. Our results are robust
to inclusion of state-year fixed effects that should at least partially account for changes in state-level
insurance coverage for reproductive procedures that might also influence the population seeking tubal
ligation.
Our paper contributes to a well-established literature that investigates the impact of access to
contraception on fertility and women’s health outcomes. This literature has focused on both increases
and decreases in access to family planning programs, abortion clinics, and availability of emergency
contraception. The conceptual framework used to understand how access to these programs affects
fertility rates in particular is ambiguous. Bailey and Lindo (2018), in their recent review, argue that
empirical evidence is critical to understand the direction of the effect. For example, decreases in access
to abortion or sterilization may induce women to substitute towards other forms of contraception (e.g.,
the pill or LARC). Access to emergency contraception may increase risky sex and sexually transmitted
infections (STIs) but reduce abortion rates and have little effect on overall fertility (Mulligan 2016,
Cintina and Johansen 2015). Our findings suggest that limiting access to sterilization and abortion
through Catholic ownership does not affect the general fertility rate (GFR) in the hospital referral region
5

of hospitals that switch to or from Catholic. When controlling for an index of policies that promote
access to emergency contraception, we do not find that those policies have a statistically significant
effect on our outcomes of interest.
Our paper also contributes to a limited literature regarding patient loyalty and hospital choice.
Lay media suggests that women may not know that their hospital is Catholic or that there are restrictions
on these reproductive services. 3 They may learn, however, after giving birth and may choose to switch
to a different hospital for the following birth. Irace (2018) exploits hospital closures due to Hurricane
Sandy and finds that patients are persistent in their hospital choice across multiple conditions. Chartock,
Garmon and Schutz (2018) find that surprise out-of-network bills on the first birth increases the odds of
switching hospitals for the second birth by 13 percent. Raval and Rosenbaum (forthcoming) analyze
patients’ choices of hospital for childbirth in Florida and find that 70 percent of women return to the
same hospital in a following birth and that without switching costs, their choice model would predict a
40 percent persistence in hospital choice, and that network restrictions like those in the ACA result in
unambiguous welfare losses. This is fairly consistent with our finding that 30 percent of women switch
hospitals between births. We find, however, that women are 50 percent more likely to switch to a nonCatholic hospital when their first hospital becomes Catholic between deliveries, which is likely to also
result in welfare losses of the magnitude measured in their paper. We acknowledge that this switching
is a plausible mechanism behind our results, but we do not believe it is the driving one.

We make some effort to estimate the welfare effect of these hospital changes by looking at racial
and payer subgroups and high and low competitive hospital referral regions (HRR) to try to understand
whether there are any disparities that come from these ownership changes. We find that Hispanic mothers

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/10/health/catholic-hospitals-procedures.html

are disproportionately affected by restrictions to tubal ligation. We also find some suggestive evidence
that the reductions in tubal ligations are larger in HRRs that have less competition and fewer alternative
hospitals for women to seek care. We perform a back-of-the-envelope calculation and estimate that these
results translate to 10,000 fewer tubal ligations per year. This is particularly concerning for populations
that use tubal ligations to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
Multiple robustness (such as sample selection, balanced panel, alternative outcome measures)
and falsification checks (such as differences in miscarriages, Caesarian sections or births), including
count and Poisson fixed effects models, did not show strong evidence that our results are sensitive to
these alternative specifications or outcome measures. Due to the small number of switching hospitals
that we identify our results off of, we use a number of clustering methods including bootstrapping our
standard errors, and these results provide additional confidence in our conclusions. We further address
potential concerns about bias in generalized difference-in-differences by implementing a method
developed by Goodman-Bacon (2018) and show that our common trends assumption holds using a new
balance test and that our results are robust to using the weights proposed.
Our paper interacts with the literature on hospital regulation by showing the consequences of the
lack of regulation, where hospitals are permitted to deny procedures based on religious grounds. This is
in contrast to the majority of the existing literature (e.g., Salkever 2000, Cook et al. 2010, Dranove 2011,
Chung et al. 2016, Clemens and Ippolito 2017) which focuses on overt regulations (e.g., pricing, staffing,
payments, investments, and competitiveness), rather than services offered. In our case, a recent
accommodation by the Supreme Court that allows religious non-profit and for-profit entities to opt out
of providing contraceptives under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) (e.g., Burwell v.
Hobby Lobby) suggests that there may be limited policy responses to curb these restrictions, and so it is
important to evaluate the impact of these restrictions on fertility and ascertain which women are most
likely to be affected. It is equally important to measure the impacts in order to weigh the trade-offs
7

between a woman’s autonomy over her health and body versus an organization’s view of being complicit
in another person’s access to religiously forbidden activities. We cannot weigh these without measures
of the costs and benefits.
Lack of access to reproductive procedures studied in this paper can have reverberations to
women’s long-term economic outcomes as well as the outcomes of their children. Bailey et al. (2016)
show that children born after family planning programs were expanded from 1965 to 1973 were
significantly less likely to grow up in poverty and Bailey et al. (2012) found that thirty percent of the
convergence of the gender wage gap in the 1990s was attributed to increased access to contraception.
Research has shown that unintended and mistimed pregnancies are associated with substantially higher
odds of low birth weight babies (Hall et al. 2017), less prenatal care and lower breastfeeding rates (Kost
and Lindberg 2015), maternal behaviors that adversely affect child health (Joyce et al. 2000), and a
higher risk of child abuse and neglect (Guterman 2015).
2. Hospital Ownership and Reproductive Outcomes
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) promotes Accountable Care
Organizations (ACOs) and the bundling of payments across providers for an episode of care (“bundled
payments”). These features of the ACA encourage consolidation between hospitals and physician
practices, and this consolidation has substantially increased since the ACA was passed. The last hospitalmerger wave in the 1990s led to substantial price increases without improvements in care quality
(Gaynor and Town 2012, Encinosa and Bernard 2005, Dafny 2009). Economic research using data from
1990-2003 has shown that hospital mergers increase both the market concentration and the price of
hospital care (Dranove et al. 2008, Wu 2009). Mergers in concentrated markets lead to significant price
increases (Dafny 2009, Tenn 2011, Town et al. 2006). Research on how consolidation may affect quality
is more nuanced. For some procedures, hospital concentration reduces quality (Gaynor and Town 2012).
Other studies suggest that competition improves quality where prices are market determined and under
8

an administered pricing system such as the U.S. Medicare Program (Gaynor and Town 2012, Cutler et
al. 2010, Rogowskti et al. 2007). However, the vast majority of studies assessing this relationship find
no statistically significant relationship between for-profit or non-profit status and mortality (Eggleston
et al. 2008). There is some evidence, though, that government-owned hospitals have a higher rate of
adverse events than non-profit hospitals (Eggleston et al. 2008).
The United States has 617 Catholic hospitals, all consolidated into 60 integrated health networks
and systems, ten of which are part of the twenty-five largest health care systems in the United States
(Uttley and Khaikin 2016). From 2001 to 2016, the number of Catholic sponsored or affiliated hospitals
increased by 22 percent, while all other types of non-profit hospitals declined in numbers. By 2016, 14.5
percent of all acute care hospitals were Catholic nationally; some states face higher percentages: in five
states (Alaska, Iowa, Washington, Wisconsin and South Dakota) more than 40 percent of acute beds
were Catholic owned or affiliated (Uttley and Khaikin 2016). Furthermore, 46 sole community hospitals
are Catholic owned or affiliated. 4
Catholic hospitals are prohibited from providing sterilization, abortion, and contraceptive
services under the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services, which are issued
by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and enforced by local bishops. In Appendix A, we include
language from the directives limiting reproductive health care services. In recent years, concerns about
health care at Catholic hospitals have caught the attention of the media and general public. For example,
in Michigan, a woman filed suit against the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops because she
did not experience appropriate care (i.e., induction or surgical removal of the fetus) when she

4
A “sole community hospital” is a designation by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) defined as a facility
at least 35 miles away from other like hospitals or requires at least 45 minutes travel time away from the nearest similar
hospital (Uttley and Khaikin 2016).

9

experienced a miscarriage at 18 weeks of pregnancy and was turned away from her local Catholic
hospital (Eckholm 2013).
Despite increased public attention to women denied necessary reproductive health care at
Catholic hospitals, research on the effects of religious reproductive health care restrictions remains
limited. 5 Existing research has typically relied on surveys and interviews of physicians. For example,
provider surveys have demonstrated a decreased likelihood of prescribing emergency contraception at
religious facilities (Rubin et al. 2006, Harrison 2005). Among obstetricians and gynecologists (OBGYNs) practicing in the United States, 22% identified their primary place of practice as religious, and
37% of these had experienced a conflict over religiously based policies (Stulberg et al. 2012). A national
survey of primary care physicians found that 43% had worked in a religiously affiliated hospital or
practice, and 19% of these had experienced a conflict over religious policies for patient care (Stulberg et
al. 2010). In qualitative interviews, Catholic hospital OB-GYNs expressed frustrations about not being
able to offer what they consider standard care, such as postpartum tubal ligation (Stulberg et al. 2014),
ectopic pregnancy management (Foster et al. 2011), and timely miscarriage management (Freedman et
al. 2008, Freedman and Stulberg 2013).
Additionally, Freedman et al. (2008) found in interviews with obstetrician–gynecologists that
physicians sometimes intentionally disregarded protocol when they believed that patient safety was
being compromised. So, despite these seemly absolute directives, we might expect less than 100%
reductions in prohibited procedures.
While these qualitative studies are suggestive, research is needed on the scope and prevalence of
these patterns of care. This study takes the first step at assessing changes in practice patterns associated
with Catholic hospital ownership.
3. Identifying the Causal Effect of Catholic Ownership

5

Economists have studied the impact of the U.S. Catholic clergy abuse scandals (Hungerman 2013, Bottan and Perez-Truglia
2015), but this research does not explicitly focus on health care outcomes.

10

We examine the effect of changes in ownership from secular to Catholic (and vice versa) on
reproductive health procedures (e.g. abortion, tubal ligation, vasectomy, D&C) that are likely to be
affected by Catholic ownership and banned under the USCCB Ethical and Religious Directives (USCCB
2009).
Our regressions take the following form:
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃ℎ𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜ℎ𝑡𝑡 + 𝜇𝜇ℎ + 𝜌𝜌𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀ℎ𝑡𝑡

where hospital h in year t has ProceduresPerBed rate of a particular procedure. This is calculated by
taking the total number of discharges that have the code for that procedure and dividing it by the total
number of beds in that hospital at time t, as one would expect larger hospitals to perform more
procedures. 6 Catholic is a dummy for whether the hospital has Catholic affiliation during that particular
year. μ are hospital fixed effects and ρ are year fixed effects. 7 Finally, robust standard errors are clustered
at the hospital level.
We identify the causal effect of Catholic ownership by assuming that consumers will not change
behavior based solely on hospital ownership. This may be plausible because women may be dealing with
an emergency and so go to the nearest hospital. As mentioned previously, women may live in an area
which is only served by a Catholic hospital and thus have no choice because of an emergency or lack of

6

See Appendix D, Table D1 which shows consistent results for using only general and OB-GYN beds as the denominator
instead of all beds. Table D2 shows a count model that does not control for the number of beds. Table D3 shows a Fixed
Effect Poisson, controlling for beds. We might also be concerned that number of beds is changing in response to Catholic
ownership (e.g., see Table 2) and so we also have Table D4 that performs a count model with additional controls as well as
time-invariant measures of beds from the first or last year of data available for each hospital. Our results are consistent across
these different specifications. Appendix F also repeats all of our results using three different denominators, and finds
directionally consistent results for each outcome, and similar consistent or inconsistent statistical significance as in the main
specifications.
7

The AHA data contain multiple time-varying hospital characteristics that are also correlated with hospital volume. We
include them, therefore, in a count model in Appendix Table D4. The controls from the AHA data that are not missing for all
the hospitals in the six states include: total payroll expenses, total expenses, total births, total admissions, FTE Physicians
and Dentists, FTE Registered Nurses, FTE Licensed Practical Nurses, FTE Medical and Dental Residents, and Total Beds.
We also run a specification with the following controls that are missing for half of our hospitals: Beds in the NICU, obstetrics
service level, and obstetric beds. Our results are robust to their inclusion.

11

resources to travel. Furthermore, women may be unaware of the change in Catholic ownership and
related policies and so therefore cannot condition on it. 8 Additionally, almost all of the hospitals that
change ownership maintain the previous name, as opposed to changing to a name that is overtly Catholic.
Finally, we provide direct evidence below that the demographic mix of patients at each hospital does not
change significantly when the hospital changes its Catholic status. That said, this assumption may be
overly restrictive and there may be demand-side effects.
Thus, we probe the validity of this assumption by examining whether women switch hospitals
after their second birth. We do find some suggestive evidence that in non-emergent (or at least expected)
situations such as childbirth, women are more likely to switch to a different non-Catholic hospital for
their second delivery if the hospital they delivered at the first time became Catholic affiliated in the
interim. We acknowledge that this is a plausible mechanism behind our results, but we do not believe it
is the driving one.
Our regression is identified off hospitals that switch Catholic status. 9 Assuming common trends,
we should be able to estimate the effect of Catholic affiliation on the procedures a hospital performs.
However, this may or may not translate into effects at the individual level because of the possible
endogeneity of hospital choice. Therefore, our results are informative about population level effects.

8

According to a small qualitative study, women surveyed did not identify that a hospital with a Catholic name would be
unlikely to provide contraception and abortion services (Guiahi et al. 2014).
9

Figure C1 shows the approximate locations of hospitals in the six states in our sample, and categorizes them as “Always
Catholic” (blue), “Never Catholic” (purple), “To Catholic,” “Catholic” (red), “From Catholic” (green), and “To and From
Catholic” for the handful of hospitals that change status more than once in the sample (black). The size of each bubble is
proportional to the average number of beds in the hospital. While there are more non-Catholic hospitals than Catholic ones,
and while most Catholic ones have that status for the entire sample period, there are also many hospitals that switch status.
We see evidence of more hospitals becoming Catholic in the states of New Jersey, California, New York and Washington,
with a few in Arizona and Florida. These hospitals appear to be randomly distributed across the states in the sample, allaying
concerns of overly correlated switches of Catholic hospitals in a particular market. In Appendix C, Figure C2, we include a
map that shows just the hospitals that switch Catholic status.

12

Those effects, though, translate more to the individual for the areas where market concentration is higher
and so the newly Catholic hospital has greater influence. 10
4. Data on Hospitals and Procedures
We use data from two primary sources for the years 1998-2013: the American Hospital
Association Annual Survey (AHA) 11 and the state-level Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP)
inpatient databases 12 for six high-population states: Arizona, Florida, New Jersey, California, New York,
and Washington. 13 These data contain the universe of utilization for all hospitals within these states and
in some cases, have patient identifiers such that we can observe patients’ utilization over time. 14 We
augment this with newly collected public data on hospital ownership 15 and with procedure categories
from the Clinical Classification Software (CCS). 16
The AHA data contains information on the name, address, ownership, system, network, and size
of each hospital in the United States. It also contains a variable as to whether the hospital is owned by a
Catholic organization, but this variable is of questionable quality, with many hospitals appearing to
switch in and out of Catholic ownership multiple times.

10

See Table 7 below where we stratify by HHI of the hospital service area and find a stronger effect of Catholic ownership
on our outcomes when HHI is higher.

12

https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/sidoverview.jsp

13
Given the high cost of the data, we were not able to include additional states. Our results are robust to any five-state
combination, as shown in Appendix D, Table D5.
14

We have patient ID data for Arizona 2004-2007; Florida 2004-2013; California 2003-2009; New York 2003-2004 &
2007-2013, Washington 2003-2013. See https://www.hcupus.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/revisit/UserGuide_SuppRevisitFilesCD.pdf
15
Per our agreement with AHA, we unfortunately can only share this new data with individuals or organizations that have a
site license for the AHA data, as it reveals the names of the individual hospital in the AHA sample.

13

Hospital sales and acquisitions as well as network and system reorganizations are generally
public events with accompanying press releases and media reports. We therefore supplement the AHA
data by searching for press releases and articles about each hospital in each state for which we have
HCUP data. This process produced new Catholic-affiliation variables, one for the hospital itself, one for
the hospital’s ownership, and one for the hospital’s system. For the analysis below, we consider a
hospital Catholic if any of these variables equals one. 17 This new variable has much less churn than the
one in the AHA, and so we believe that it is a better representation of a hospital’s affiliation. With this
variable, across the states for which we have HCUP data, we observe approximately a third of all hospital
mergers both to and from Catholic-affiliation that occurred nationally from 1998 until 2013 (Uttley and
Khaikan 2016).
We merge these AHA and public data with inpatient discharge data from HCUP for the six states
in our sample over the years 1998-2013. However, we do not have inpatient data for every state for every
year. 18 This should not pose an econometric problem, since data availability is not related to Catholic
affiliation. Furthermore, this lack of data is at the level of a state-year-file and not at the individual
hospital level. We estimated models using a balanced panel and find consistent results. 19
From the HCUP data, we keep hospital-years that have ICD-9 codes for at least one of the
following fertility related procedures: tubal ligation, Caesarian section (C-section), vasectomy, abortion,
and dilation and curettage (D&C), as these are the procedures most likely to be affected by Catholic
directives. 20 We identify which ICD-9 codes correspond to these procedures using the CCS’s list of

17

See Appendix D, Table D6 which shows consistent results for only setting Catholic = 1 if the hospital itself is Catholic and
not just the network or system.
18

See Appendix C, Table C1 for a list of hospital-years.

19

See Appendix D, Table D7, which shows consistent results when only using hospitals that appear in all of the years for

procedure categories and codes. 21 We also use the CCS’s lists of both procedure and diagnosis categories
to identify complications, including hysterectomy, blood transfusion, maternal infections, and maternal
hemorrhage. We define severe maternal morbidity (SMM) using the CDC definition. 22
We link the AHA and HCUP data using the linkage files provided by HCUP which give the AHA
ID to HCUP hospital ID mapping. Similarly, we define a “hospital” for the purposes of this analysis by
its AHA ID. We also include HCUP’s Hospital Market Structure information on competitiveness of a
hospital service area 23 for one of the stratified investigations below.
5. Estimated Impact of Catholic Ownership on Reproductive Procedures
Table 1 contains summary statistics. Panel A shows the average number of beds and the average
procedure rates for hospital-years that are Catholic and those that are not. Catholic hospitals tend to be
somewhat larger than non-Catholic hospitals. They also have statistically significant differences in
almost every procedure and diagnosis.

It is important to note that while tubal ligations and C-sections are generally inpatient procedures,
vasectomies and abortions are generally outpatient procedures (Babigumira et al. 2015) and so minimally
appear in our inpatient discharge data, explaining the low per-bed means. Despite this, we include them
as these procedures are restricted by USCCB directives and are suggestive of the directives being
somewhat binding.
We also include above the rate of discharges that have both a procedure code for a tubal ligation
and for a C-section. This is because many women who have a C-section for their last child choose to
have a tubal ligation at the same time, avoiding an additional abdominal surgery (Committee on Health
Care for Underserved Women 2012). Sterilization is performed following 10% of all births and
performing the procedure immediately postpartum is considered the most effective method (ACOG
2003, Kaunitz et al. 2008). If a woman delivers a baby in a Catholic hospital and wants to become
17

sterilized following the birth, she must now have an additional operation in a different hospital for a
tubal ligation, increasing the risk of complications (Miller 2015).
Table 1, Panel A also includes the mean rates of a miscarriage or stillbirth, as well as a
miscarriage or stillbirth with an accompanying complication. 24 There is anecdotal evidence that Catholic
hospitals wait for the fetal heartbeat to cease during a miscarriage before performing a D&C (Freedman,
Landy, and Steinauer 2008). Our hypothesis is therefore that Catholic affiliation may increase the rates
of associated complications, but have no effect on the number of miscarriages and stillbirths.
Finally, Table 1, Panel A also contains means for patient demographic characteristics. These are
calculated for patients that have at least one of the reproductive related diagnoses or procedures of
interest for our analysis, namely tubal ligation, C-sections, vasectomies, abortions, D&C, miscarriages,
and stillbirths. As with the procedure and diagnoses rates, there are statistically significant differences
between Catholic and not-Catholic hospitals. 25
Table 1, Panel B shows the breakdown of hospitals by whether they had an ownership change
and the type of change. Our results below are identified based on the 37 hospitals that change status at
least once during the time period that we study. 26
Table 1, Panel C, shows the means for the variables in Panel A for the 30 hospitals that change
Catholic affiliation exactly once. One can see the outlines of our main results here – that prohibited
reproductive procedures decrease when hospitals become Catholic and increase when hospitals cease
being Catholic.
Panel C also suggests changes in the demographic composition of patients. Therefore, before
turning to our main regression results, we want to check formally whether patient demographic

24

We define a complication for at least one of the following codes: maternal infection (diagnosis), maternal hemorrhage
(diagnosis), hysterectomy (procedure), or transfusion (procedure).
25
Including hospital fixed effects does not, however, change the statistical significance of our results. See Tables 3 and 4
(with hospital fixed effects) and Table D9 (without).
26
Out of the 37 hospitals that change status, 13 become Catholic, 17 stop being Catholic, and 7 change status more than once.

18

characteristics change in a statistically significant way when hospital fixed effects are included. Table 2
has the results of estimating our main regression but with the share of patients that have a particular
demographic characteristic as the outcome variable as opposed to the rate of procedures per bed. We
also include the number of beds itself to see if hospitals are changing size when they change affiliation.
Based on the results in Table 2 Panel A, we see minimal evidence of compositional changes in patients
attending hospitals that switch to or from Catholic ownership. There may also be changes in hospital
characteristics that could influence our outcomes of interest and we evaluate them in Panel B of Table 2
We find no evidence that hospital characteristics, such as total expenditure, births or number of doctors,
change with Catholic ownership. This allows us to proceed to the main results with some confidence in
our identification strategy. 27

27

This also suggests that despite the overall merger-driven Catholic consolidation in the U.S., our results are identified
from hospitals becoming or ceasing to be Catholic affiliated without substantially changing in size.

Notes: All regressions include hospital and year fixed effects. These regressions include all hospitals in
our sample. “Dependent Var. Mean” row refers to the mean for hospitals that are not Catholic in that
year. Robust standard errors clustered at hospital level in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

Panels A and B of Figure 1 show an event study for the per bed rate of tubal ligations for the 30
hospitals that change status once. Each point comes from a coefficient on a dummy variable for that
value of event time. To be consistent with our regressions below, we also include hospital and year fixed
effects and cluster standard errors at the hospital level.
Time zero is defined as the first year of Catholic affiliation (Panel A) or the last year of Catholic
affiliation (Panel B). We exclude hospitals that have the same affiliation throughout the sample, as well
as the ones that switch more than once, though both are included in the regressions below.

28

Throughout the paper, we are reporting the “within” R-squared per the xtreg, fe model in Stata, which are
“obtained by only fitting a mean deviated model where the effects of the groups (all of the dummy variables) are assumed
to be fixed quantities.” See https://www.stata.com/support/faqs/statistics/areg-versus-xtreg-fe/.

Notes: From regressions which included a dummy for year in event time. The last year non-Catholic (Panel A) or nonCatholic (Panel B) year (-1) was omitted. Whiskers show 95% confidence interval. Both regressions include hospital and
year fixed effects. Robust standard errors are clustered at the hospital level.

In Panel A, one can see a persistent level drop in the post period. In Panel B, there is a smaller
but clear increase in the early part of the post period. This is in part because sales of religious hospitals
to non-religious organizations can include stipulations to maintain religion-based restrictions on
procedures. 29

One may be concerned that there is an overall downward trend that is driving this result. Out of
the 17 hospitals that become Catholic, two do have a multi-year downward trend in their per bed tubal
ligation rate. Our results, though, are robust to omitting those two hospitals from the analysis. 30

Table 3 contains results from our main regression for the tubal ligation rate for many different
specifications. Column (1) is a parsimonious model for the pure within-hospital effect for all hospitals,
with hospital fixed effects but without year fixed effects. Column (2) adds year fixed effects in case there
are national trends which might affect the results, though here they have minimal impact on the
coefficient of interest. We consider this to be our primary specification, as it includes all of the hospitals
and a full set of time and hospital fixed effects.
Columns (3)-(5) exclude different groups of hospitals, including those that do not change, those
that become Catholic, and those that stop being Catholic. 31 In Columns (6)-(7), we test our identification

30

See Appendix D, Table D10. We also preform the balance test proposed by Goodman-Bacon (2018) and fail to reject the
hypothesis that trends differ.
31

One might be concerned that with only 37 hospital that change ownership that we would not have enough power to identify
a statistically significant result. The results in the third columns of Tables 3-5 show that our results are actually more precise
when focusing on only these hospitals, and so demonstrate that we have sufficient power. We have also bootstrapped our

22

by including a one-year lead for hospitals that switch to Catholic. Not all hospitals in our sample have
data for this lead. Column (6) estimates our main result with this subsample and Column (7) includes
the lead. Although this lead is not statistically significant, it may explain about 20% of our effect. We
also estimate lagged models to better understand how effects vary over time (Appendix Table D11). We
find that these effects are more immediate, which is consistent with our other suggestive evidence that
patients may learn about the religious restriction over time and sort to other hospitals.
The coefficient is fairly consistent across specifications, with Catholic affiliation reducing the
per bed tubal ligation rate by 31%, compared with non-Catholic hospitals. 32 Furthermore, when
comparing the results in Columns (4) and (5) to the other coefficients in the table, it appears that the
effect is being driven by hospitals that become Catholic, as only using hospitals that are no longer
Catholic affiliated gives a smaller coefficient (though it is of the same direction). 33
Table 4 Panel A repeats this analysis for the per bed rate of both a tubal ligation and C-section.
As above, the effect is consistent across specifications and driven primarily by hospitals that become
Catholic affiliated. Compared to the mean, becoming Catholic affiliated reduces the per bed rate by 24%.
Hospitals that are no longer Catholic have no significant change in C-section and tubal ligation compared
to hospitals that do not change ownership.

standard errors for the main result in Column (2) of Table 3 and the p-value becomes 0.004. For Column (3) that includes
just switching hospitals, the bootstrapped p-value is 0.000.
32

One might be concerned that we are simultaneously testing six different hypotheses in Tables 3-5. A conservative
Bonferroni correction would be to set a p-value threshold of 0.17% (1/6) instead of 1%. The p-values for tubal ligation in
Column (2) are less than 0.17% and so the result is still statistically significant even with this stringent definition.
33

Again, this may be due to sales including stipulations to maintain religion-based restrictions on procedures. See
http://www.mergerwatch.org/sale-of-religious-hospitals/

Table 4 Panel B repeats the analysis for vasectomies. Here the results are trickier, as the mean is
extremely low due to the fact that most vasectomies are performed as an outpatient procedure. Still, the
coefficient is statistically significant and driven by hospitals that become Catholic affiliated. At the mean,
this coefficient represents a greater than 100% decrease, which is partly a function of the mean being so
low. Still, the result is overall consistent with those above.
Table 4 Panel C repeats the analysis for the per bed abortion rate. As with vasectomies, abortion
is usually an outpatient procedure and the average rate is very low. The coefficient in the full
specification in Column (2) corresponds to 30% decrease at the mean, which is very close to the
percentage drops from the results in Table 3. However, the results in Columns (4) and (5) are not
24

statistically significant, and so it is difficult to say which kind of hospital affiliation change is driving
the results.
Table 5 Panel A and Panel B show estimates for the two procedures that we do not expect to be
affected by Catholic affiliation: C-section rates by themselves and D&Cs. These tables show few
statistically significant results, nor directionally consistent point estimates, which confirms our
hypothesis that the number of these procedures performed should not be affected by Catholic
ownership. 34

34

We also investigate as an outcome variable the total number of reproductive discharges (i.e., ones that that have
reproductive procedure or diagnoses, including abortion, tubal ligation, vasectomy, D&C, C-section, hysterectomy, IUD,
childbirth, miscarriage, stillbirth, maternal hemorrhage, or maternal infection. This is a larger sample of hospital-years (any
with at least one of these procedures or diagnoses) than our primary one (at least one of tubal ligation, C-section,
vasectomy, abortion, and D&C). We find that our tubal ligation results are consistent in this larger sample, but that across
multiple specifications, including count (with and without adjusting for the number of beds) and per bed rates, we find no
statistically significant effect of changing to or from Catholic on this new measure. See Appendix D, Table D12.

25

6. Welfare Implications of Reductions in Reproductive Procedures
The above results confirm that hospitals that switch to Catholic ownership seem to partially
comply with USCCB Ethical and Religious Directives (USCCB 2009) and reduce certain reproductive
health procedures. We now consider the broader welfare implications of these changes, parameterized
with a handful of metrics that are possible with our data sets. We first start with stratifying our main
results by dimensions that may indicate racial disparities or which women are disproportionately affected
by these ownership changes.
We examine the racial and ethnic breakdown of the effect on the per bed rate of tubal ligations
in Table 6. Column (1) has the per bed rate for discharges in any of the three groups. 35 The result in
Column (1) is comparable to the results above. The results of Columns (2)-(5) are all of a comparable
direction and magnitude, although the result for whites is no longer statistically significant. Using the
mean for all hospitals, the percentage changes are also comparable – 22%, 37%, 31%, and 33%. Overall,
this result is most precisely estimated when non-white women are pooled together in Column (5).
However, it is possible that individuals of different races and ethnicities are not being admitted
to the same hospitals and therefore these point estimates have different relative meaning. The second
row of dependent variable means is for hospitals that switch status when they are not Catholic. Here we
see that the mean rate is much lower for Hispanics, which makes the relative drop much larger (68%).
This relative effect is almost as large when pooling blacks and Hispanics (57%). 36

35

Notice that the mean of 0.372 (for all hospitals) is lower than the mean in Table 3 of 0.456 due to the exclusion of the
“other” category from the numerator but the same denominator. Also notice that the means in Columns (2)-(4) sum to the
mean in Column (1).
36
While this is suggestive of a larger impact on Hispanics, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that these coefficients are
statistically significantly different from each other.

Table 7 stratifies by competitiveness of the hospital service area, using HCUP’s 2006 data on the
Herfindahl Hirschman Index (HHI). We do this to determine whether having fewer alternative hospitals
in a service area explain our findings. While we cannot reject that the coefficients in Columns (2) and
(3) are equal to each other, it is strongly suggestive that hospital service areas with more concentration
in a handful of hospitals (i.e., more market power for the Catholic hospital), the greater the reduction on
the tubal ligation rate from being Catholic affiliated. We discuss additional heterogeneity of our
findings in Appendix G where we stratify by age, insurance type and type of Catholic affiliation.

Next, one can imagine a scenario where a woman who wants a tubal ligation cannot get one at
the hospital where she is planning on delivering her final child. She therefore then has to recover and go
to a different hospital for a tubal ligation.
In five out of the six states that we have data for (excluding New Jersey) and for the years 2003
and onward, we can identify patients across discharges and also order those discharges in time. Using
these measures, we can identify women who had a C-section and then had a subsequent tubal ligation in
another hospital without a subsequent C-section. Table 8 shows our main results from above for the
subset of states and years with these patient linking variables, as well as the impact of Catholic affiliation
on this new variable. First, we check the consistency in this subsample of our main results (for tubal
ligation, C-section and tubal ligation, vasectomy, and abortion) from Table 4. The estimates in the
Columns (1)-(2) are comparable to above, whereas those in (3) and (4) are directionally consistent but
no longer statistically significant, perhaps due to the loss of power and variation from these exclusions.
Column (5), however, shows both an exceptionally low mean rate of our new variable and also a
marginally significant coefficient which has the opposite sign of our hypothesis. 37 We also looked at
days from birth to tubal ligation in order to measure the intensive margin of a delay in tubal ligation and

37

These results are consistent using a broader definition, namely a woman who has a child (by any means of delivery) but
not tubal ligation, and then later a tubal ligation and no C-section.

28

show those results in Appendix D Table D13. We find some qualitative evidence that the time to tubal
ligation for vaginal births increases, but time to tubal ligation for C-sections does not change.

We now turn to another measure, which comes from the concern that miscarriage management
may be compromised by religion-based restrictions (Freedman, Landy, and Steinauer 2008). There is
anecdotal evidence of health care providers waiting for the fetal heartbeat to stop before performing a
D&C, resulting in the mother losing so much blood that she experiences a substantial complication,38
such as needing a transfusion to survive. Had she received the D&C earlier, the outcome for the fetus
would have been the same (i.e., termination), but she could have been spared the complication. In
particular, a transfusion also has an opportunity cost for everyone else who may need blood, not to
mention the risks to her. 39

38

We define a complication as at least one of: maternal infection (diagnosis code), maternal hemorrhage (diagnosis code),
hysterectomy (procedure code), or transfusion (procedure code).

Table 9 Panel A first checks whether there is an impact of Catholic affiliation on the rate of
miscarriages or stillbirths themselves. As expected, we do not see any statistically significant coefficients
here. Table 9 Panel B then repeats this for records that have both a diagnosis of miscarriage or stillbirth
that also have at least one associated complication. Despite the anecdotal evidence mentioned above, we
see no increase in the complication rate for women who are miscarrying or have a stillbirth. If anything,
there is some evidence to the contrary – that complication rates decrease. Table 9 Panel C repeats this
for records with severe maternal morbidity (SMM), which is a broader definition of complications from
birth. 40 We again see weak evidence that SMM may be decreasing (a decrease would support an overall
conclusion of improved quality). Lastly, Table 9 Panel D checks whether there is an impact of Catholic
affiliation on the rate of hysterectomies for women under age 40. Hysterectomy for this age group may
be indicated during a hemorrhage, if women have fibroids or endometriosis and is another form of
sterilization. We again find some evidence that there is a reduction in rate of hysterectomies. While
consistently negative, unlike the effect on tubal ligations, this effect is not precisely estimated across
specifications, ranging from 4% to 33%.

Table 10 then shows the results for another outcome measure: the birth rate (births per bed) by
hospital. 41 Our hypothesis here is that a decrease in the tubal ligation rate may lead to more births in
Catholic hospitals. As described in the introduction and background, unintended pregnancies have many
costs to women and their children. These costs may also vary by race/ethnicity and insurance coverage.
Despite this hypothesis, we find no evidence that the birth rate changed, overall or for any racial or

41

We define births by discharges for delivering mothers that include a live childbirth diagnosis. One might be concerned that
this undercounts births due to non-singletons or children born outside of hospitals. Comparing the year-state totals from
https://wonder.cdc.gov/natality.html yields undercount estimates of less than 10%, suggesting that this is a valid approach.

31

insurance subgroup. 42 Qualitatively, the magnitudes are small and directionally suggest the opposite of
this hypothesis. This is at first surprising, but the conceptual framework used to understand the
implications of reduced access to abortion suggest an ambiguous result (Bailey and Lindo 2018). Women
who cannot get a tubal ligation due to a change in ownership may seek alternative contraceptive methods,
such as LARC, which is growing in popularity over this time period. Furthermore, we see some evidence
that women are switching to a non-Catholic hospital for their second birth, which would allow them to
get the tubal ligation as planned.

A growing literature has shown that hospital loyalty results in welfare losses due to patients
persisting with less quality hospitals. In addition, our Table 3 may be biased by composition effects and
so we test for sorting of patients by restricting to women who have at least two births during our time of
interest. In Table 11 Panel A, we perform an individual level linear probability model for two outcomes:
1) binary for switching hospital between deliveries (regardless of Catholic status) and 2) binary for
switching to a hospital that is not Catholic. We cluster standard errors at the level of the birth hospital

42

We also repeat our analysis by looking at the general fertility (GFR) rate by hospital service area as a function of the share
of beds in Catholic hospitals and find analogous results, overall or for any racial subgroup.

32

for the second birth. We find some suggestive evidence that women are 50% more likely to switch if the
hospital where they first gave birth became Catholic between deliveries. These estimates are not
precisely estimated. In Table 11 Panel B, we estimate the second outcome (binary for switching to a
non-Catholic hospital) for different subgroups of women. We find larger and more precisely estimated
effects for black and Hispanic women and women on Medicaid, though we cannot reject the hypothesis
that any pair of coefficients is equal to each other.

Notes: These regressions are performed on individual level data for the population of states where we have individual person
id across hospitalizations. We limit to the sample to women who have exactly two births, and to women whose first hospital
was never Catholic or always Catholic (Hospital to Catholic =0), or switched to Catholic between the years of the first and
second birth (Hospital to Catholic = 1). We drop women whose first birth hospital switch from Catholic to non-Catholic
affiliation. Columns (1)-(3) of Panel A is a linear probability model of the likelihood a mother switches hospitals between the
two births (“Any Switch”) (i.e., the two hospitals have different AHA IDs). Columns (4)-(6) are the likelihood that the mother
switches to hospital that is not Catholic. Panel B is a linear probability model for “Switch to Non-Catholic” where each
column is a separate subgroup of mothers. In Panel B, all regressions include State and Year FE. Individual controls include
dummies for Black, White, Hispanic, and payer categories. “Dep. Var. Mean” row refers to the mean for hospitals that are
not Catholic in that year. Robust standard errors clustered at hospital are in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

8. Robustness checks
33

Appendix D contains several robustness checks, some of which have been referenced above. Our
results are robust to limiting the sample to adult and OB-GYN beds as the denominator, though this
reduces our sample because some hospitals’ AHA records do not have a breakdown of the general beds
(Table D1). They are also robust to only treating a hospital as Catholic affiliated if the hospital itself is
Catholic and not just part of a network or system. This reduces the number of switching hospitals from
37 to 32 (Table D6). The results are robust to the inclusion of the county unemployment rate (Table
D14).
Our results are also robust to only using hospitals that appear in every year of data we have for
their state (Table D7). They are also robust to excluding the years when a hospital changes status, in case
we are mis-categorizing those years as we do not have time variables other than year in the HCUP data.
This is even the case if we also include an additional year before and after. This is in the spirit of Barreca,
et al.’s (2011) “donut” regressions (Tables D15, D16).
Additionally, our results are robust to only considering general hospitals (Table D17) or only
considering not-profit hospitals (Table D18), as one might expect them to behave differently than forprofit hospitals (David 2009). Both of these categories can be identified using the AHA data. Our results
are also robust to including a state-year fixed effect instead of only a year fixed effect (state fixed effects
would be collinear with hospital fixed effects) (Table D19), and to alternate specifications, such as a
count, log, and Poisson model, all controlling for the number of beds in the hospital or using a timeinvariant measure of beds, or including other controls from the AHA data. (Tables D3, D4, D20 and D21
and Appendix F). 43
In order to better understand whether hospitals switching to or from Catholic are both
experiencing similar levels of consolidation, we estimate models with number of hospitals in the system

43

Our results are robust to a count model that does not control for the number of beds. See Appendix D, Table D2. We also
show that the count model is robust to including hospital characteristics in Appendix Table D4.

34

as the outcome in Table D22. We find some evidence that switching from Catholic to not-Catholic results
in a smaller system and may be indicative of deconsolidation.
We also perform a falsification check using the AHA variable for hospital system. We estimate
how tubal ligations change with other system changes in Appendix Table D23. If anything, we find
positive effects from system changes, although none are precisely estimated. In Column (4), we add this
to our primary specification and the coefficient on Catholic ownership is virtually the same as our main
result reported in Table 3. We also estimate two models intended to understand any observable
differences between hospitals that switch (either to or from Catholic). Table D24 provides these
estimates and we do not find evidence that observables are explaining the likelihood that a hospital
switches to or from Catholic.
There may be state-level changes in the availability of emergency contraception which could
change the population of women seeking tubal ligation or abortion. We collected policy information and
created fixed effects for various policy supports or restrictions of emergency contraception and including
these controls does not change our main effect. 44
Lastly, we address potential concerns about the robustness of generalized difference-indifferences (see Goodman-Bacon 2018). In Appendix E, we describe the proposed method and our
implementation of it. In particular, we do not find any violation of the variance weighted common trends
(VWCT) assumption using the balance test described in Goodman-Bacon (2018). We also calculate the
weights proposed and adjust the estimates and find very similar “variance weighted average treatment
on the treated” (VWATT) to our main result.

9. Discussion

44

The coefficient is -0.140***.

35

Of the 25 largest hospital systems in the United States, one-third are Catholic, with a combined
67,345 staffed beds (Uttley and Khaikin 2016). Multiplying this by our main primary result above from
Column (2) of Table 3 (-0.141) translates into 9,496 fewer tubal ligations per year as a result of Catholic
restrictions on reproductive care. This alone represents a substantial cost to women, who must
subsequently rely on other, less-reliable forms of contraception.
Despite our results that show these substantial decreases when a hospital is Catholic affiliated,
the relative effects are less than 100%. This is puzzling, as one would expect the Catholic-based
guidelines on a hospital to be binding. One possible hypothesis is that these guidelines are not in fact
binding, and physicians have de facto leeway to ignore the guidelines when they see fit. Freedman,
Landy, and Steinauer (2008) found exactly this in interviews with obstetrician-gynecologists. Physicians
sometimes intentionally disregarded protocol when they believed that patient safety was being
compromised.
Another question is why the magnitude of the effects is generally smaller for hospitals that stop
being Catholic versus ones that become Catholic. Here, as mentioned above, the likely explanation is
that some of the sales of Catholic hospitals contain stipulations keeping the previous religion-based
restrictions. 45
It is also surprising that we do not find substantial changes in welfare (by these measures). It is
possible that women having C-sections and then tubal ligations elsewhere is simply too rare (unlike a
tubal ligation) for us to measure in our data or that women reduce their take-up of this procedure when
they are faced with the restriction. 46 One possible explanation for why we find tubal ligation rates
decreasing but no change in birth rates is that outpatient vasectomies increase to compensate as
households switch sterilization strategies. The two are obviously close substitutes, with multiple studies

45

See again http://www.mergerwatch.org/sale-of-religious-hospitals/

46

A limitation of our analysis is that we cannot know if patients switched hospitals to undertake procedures after the
hospital changed to Catholic.

36

finding a cross-sectional negative correlation between tubal ligation and vasectomy rates when
stratifying by income (Fransoo et al. 2013), education (Anderson et al. 2012), and race (Borrero et al.
2009). Our results suggest that other, specific welfare margins such as the rates of unintended
pregnancies would be an appropriate outcome to consider, but this would require substantially different
data sets.
That said, our results suggest that more women face the risks of unintended pregnancies when a
hospital in their community becomes Catholic and imposes religious-based restrictions on reproductive
procedures. Unintended pregnancies result in substantial financial costs and worse outcomes for
children. As of 2015, the US Department of Agriculture estimates that it costs $233,610 to raise a child
from birth to the age of 17 (Lino et al 2017). These costs can be a substantial share of the total budget
for low-income families. Children who experience an unintended birth of a sibling experience negative
spillover effects such as declines in the quality of the home environment and increased behavioral
problems (Barber and East 2011). Thus, the effects of an unintended pregnancy on child outcomes are
negative and in some cases substantial.
Finally, our results are suggestive of racial disparities in the effect of Catholic restrictions on
tubal ligations, with the largest relative effect on Hispanics. This is consistent with the general consensus
in the literature that finds racial disparities in health care (e.g., Kirby et al. 2006). We also find suggestive
evidence that our effect is stronger for hospitals that are Catholic-owned, and also for Catholic-owned
institutions for hospital service areas that have greater market concentration that provide consumers with
fewer options.
10. Conclusion
In this paper, we investigate the effect of Catholic hospital ownership on the likelihood that a
woman receives appropriate reproductive health care. We use within-hospital, across-patient variation
to control for potential differences in patient population across different types of hospitals, including a
hospital fixed effect. We compile a new data set of hospital ownership status and characterize hospitals

as “switchers” (from Catholic to non-Catholic and vice versa) or always Catholic/non-Catholic. We find
statistically significant reductions in multiple procedures defined as prohibited by the UCCSB religious
guidelines. Most concerning are large reductions in the number of tubal ligations performed in Catholicowned hospitals.
Our results are stronger in hospital service areas that lack competition, that contribute to greater
health disparities for low-income women who lack the time or financial resources to travel to another
provider in another service area. Women of color and those who do not have a college education are more
likely to rely on contraceptive sterilization for birth control (Daniels et al. 2014). For many women, the
lack of sterilization results in an unplanned pregnancy: in one study, nearly half of women with an
unfulfilled postpartum sterilization request became pregnant within one year (Thurman and Janecek
2010). As a result, the imposition of a particular religion’s medical restrictions on others, without their
consent, could have a substantial negative impact. Previous research has shown that children born from
unplanned and mistimed pregnancies have substantially worse health outcomes. While we do not see an
effect on the overall birth rate at the hospital service area, it is possible that there is still an effect on
subsets of the population. We leave it to further research with additional data sets to measure that
outcome.

Appendix A
Catholic Hospitals are governed by the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care
(Directives), some of which restrict reproductive health care of women:
•
•
•
•
•

•

“Catholic hospitals may not promote or condone contraceptive practices.” (Directive 52)
“Abortion (that is, the directly intended termination of pregnancy before viability or the directly
intended destruction of a viable fetus) is never permitted.” (Directive 45)
“Prenatal diagnosis is not permitted when undertaken with the intention of aborting an unborn
child with a serious defect.” (Directive 10)
“In case of extrauterine pregnancy, no intervention is morally licit which constitutes a direct
abortion.” (Directive 48)
“Heterologous fertilization (that is, any technique used to achieve conception by the use of
gametes coming from at least one donor other than the spouses) is prohibited because it is
contrary to the covenant of marriage, the unity of the spouses, and the dignity proper to parents
and the child.” (Directive 40)
“Direct sterilization of either men or women, whether permanent or temporary, is not permitted
in a Catholic health care institution.” (Directive 53)“Catholic health care services must . . .
require adherence to [the Directives] within the institution as a condition for medical privileges
and employment.” (Directive 5)

Notes: Estimates in Columns 1-3 are from a linear model and the dependent variable is the number
of tubal ligations performed in each hospital year. We add AHA controls described as “no missing”:
total payroll expenses, total expenses, total births, total admissions, FTE Physicians and Dentists,
FTE Registered Nurses, FTE Medical and Dental Residents, and Total Beds and “most”: includes
no missing plus Beds in the NICU, obstetrics service level, and obstetric beds. For Columns 4 and 5,
the dependent variable is the per bed tubal ligation rate. Columns 6 and 7 are from a Poisson model
and the dependent variable is the number of tubal ligation procedures performed in each hospital in
each year. All regressions include hospital and year fixed effects. “Dep Var. Mean” row refers to the
mean for hospitals that are not Catholic in that year. We use two time-invariant beds measures from
the first year of data (“Start Beds”) and from the last year of data (“End Beds”). Robust standard
errors in parentheses are clustered at the hospital. ** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

Notes: This table is made up of a subsample defined as follows: for each hospital, use the earliest year of data in the
sample. Column (1) is made up of the non-Catholic hospitals in the first year of data we have. The dependent variable
is whether it ever becomes Catholic. Column (2) is made up of the Catholic hospitals in the first year of data we have.
The dependent variable is whether it ever becomes non-Catholic. Standard errors in parentheses.

Appendix E: Goodman-Bacon (2018) Robustness Checks
As an additional layer of robustness checks we follow Goodman-Bacon (2018). This paper shows
how the treatment effects resulting from a specification as the one in equation (1) are simply a
weighted average of all the possible 2x2 difference-in-differences combinations that can be formed
with the data. The author shows how these fixed effects estimator is a consistent estimator of a
weighted version of the ATT if the treatment effects do not change over time and a generalized
version of the common trends assumption holds. To compute the weights, the sample is divided in
groups, where a group is defined as hospitals switching status in the same year (and an additional
group is created with those that never change status). These weights will depend not only in the
relative sizes of each of the groups, but also on the number of periods within the sample before and
after treatment for each group.
To implement this battery of tests we require a balanced panel which leads us to generate four
different subsamples within our main sample. In addition, we disregard any hospital that switched
status more than once in the period as well as those that switched from Catholic to non-Catholic.

Part 1: Testing for VWCT (Variance Weighted Common Trends)
We start by testing the variance weighted common trends assumption. To do so, we generate, for
each group a weight as a treatment group and weight as a control group 47. The fact that groups of
switchers act as control groups arises naturally in this setting, in which different units are treated at
different points in time, thus can both be used as treatment groups when they switch status and
control groups when they don’t. The relative importance of each group acting as a control or a
treatment will define its net treatment weight, or in words, whether a group is a net treatment group
or a control group. Finally, we test whether the pre-trends for the net treatment weighted version of
the treatment group is different than those in the never treated group.
To implement this in our data, we generate a dummy variable B that takes value 1 if a group acts as
a net treatment group (i.e. if its weight as a treatment group is greater than its weight as a control
group). Then we regress the outcome variable pre-treatment on B, year dummies and its interaction
with B, weighting each group by it net weight as a treatment group. The inclusion of the net weights
allows us to control for the importance of each group in determining the fixed effect estimator and
apply this same weighting to the pre-trend test. Our second specification, replace the year dummies
with a time trend.
The results of this specifications can be seen in Table E3 and Table E4. We do not find any evidence
of differential pre-trends for the treated units in comparison with the controls. All specifications
show insignificant coefficients for the interaction of the year dummies with B, as well as for the
interaction of the time trend with B.

47

See Goodman-Bacon (2018) for a detailed description on how to compute this weights for each of the groups.

Part 2: Explaining why TVTE would be an insignificant issue in our setting
68

In this setting an additional challenge to the validity of our results could arise if treatment effects
vary over time (i.e. if the effect arises a few periods after treatment, or if it increases or decreases
over the time). This is a consequence of the use of already treated units as controls for groups treated
later in time. We don’t see this as concern in our setting, since the magnitude of the bias introduced
by the already treated units acting as controls is function of the relative group sizes. Since our group
of never treated contains always more than 100 times the number of hospitals in any treated group
the bias will be negligible. As an example, for our first subsample, 0.11% of the fixed effect is a
result of comparing early vs late treatment units. This proportion never exceeds 1.1% (fourth
subsample) and should be of a similar magnitude in our main specification of the paper.
Part 3: How does the fixed effect estimator (VWATT) compares to other estimators (SWATT)
While our previous test show that the fixed effects estimator in our main specification is consistent
for the ATT, it is still interesting to understand how it aggregates all the 2x2 difference-indifferences. Figure E1 shows the implicit weights used by the FE estimator for each group and
compares them with the sample weights, for each of our subsamples. The graph below shows that
there are some clear differences between both pairs of weights.
Figure E1: VWATT Weights vs Sample Weights

69

The graphs show the weights associated to each group’s ATT under the fixed effect regression as in equation (1) and how the
compared to the sample weights for each group in each of our 4 subsamples. See Goodman-Bacon (2018) for more details
Top left corner: Subsample 1. Top right corner: Subsample 2. Bottom left corner: Subsample 3. Bottom right corner: Subsample 4.

While not a problem per se, it could be that the weights used by the FE estimator is what is driving
our main result, and a different weighting procedure would give us a completely different estimator.
To analyze this idea we compare, for each subsample, the FE estimator to a different version in
which sample weights are used to calculate the ATT. To do this, we calculate all the potential DiD
for each of the groups vs the never treated group and aggregate them using the sample weights.
Figure E2 presents the result of this exercise, where the red dots represent the estimator from a FE
regression as in our main specification, and the blue dots are the sample weighted version of the
estimator. We can see that both are very similar for all subsamples, providing further robustness to
our main result of the paper.

Appendix G: Heterogeneity
We stratify our primary result for tubal ligations across several different dimensions.
Stratification by racial/ethnic groups and HHI are in the main body of the paper.
Data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), as presented in Bailey and Lindo
(2018), suggest that the majority of tubal ligations are performed on older women. In Appendix
Table G1, we find evidence of a larger impact of Catholic ownership on tubal ligations for women
over the age of 40 (rate is reduced by 35%). We also stratify births and miscarriages/stillbirths with
complications by age. We find a marginally significant decrease in the birth rate for women ages
30-39 (Appendix Table G2). The potential protective effect of Catholic ownership on miscarriage
or stillbirths with complications appears to be driven by improvements for younger women
(Appendix Table G3).

Appendix Table G4 then stratifies the regression by insurance type. We also see comparable
results for Medicaid and private insurance. The main difference is in Column (4) where we see a
much larger decrease for those who do not have insurance, approaching 100%. It is also consistent
with the results in Table 6 as black and Hispanic women receiving tubal ligations are more likely to
be on Medicaid or self-paying than white women.

Appendix Table G5 looks at which type of Catholic affiliation has the most impact on our
main results. Given that the three variables are highly correlated, we have also included a p-value
for the joint significance of the three coefficients. The joint significance tests perfectly match our
results above, with statistically significant effects for tubal ligations, vasectomies, and abortions,
but not for C-sections. However, when looking at the different types of Catholic affiliation, Catholic
ownership has a stronger and more statistically significant effect, especially for the tubal ligation
rate.
