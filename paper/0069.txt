Abstract

The paper explains how the Almon polynominal lag specification can be
made stochastic in two different ways - one suggested by Shiller and
another following the lines of Liridley and Smith. It is shown that
both the estimators can be considered as modified ridge estimators.
The paper then compares these modified ridge estimators with the ridge

estimator suggested by Hoerl and Kennard. It is shown that for the
estimation of distributed lag models the ridge estimator suggested by
Hoerl and Kennard is not useful but that the modified ridge estimators
corresponding to thestochastic versions of the Almon lag are promising.
The paper has two empirical illustrations.

Consider a distributed lag model

The problems in the direct least squares estimation of (1) are: firstly,
p the length of the lag is not known and secondly, even if p is known, because of

high multicollinearity between the x, ordinary least squares estimates usually
are erratic. The problem of an unknown p is usually 'solved' by assuming an
infinite lag distribution that 'dies out' after a certain point. The Koyck [8],
Solow [13], and Jorgenson [7] models are examples of this. There are, on the
other hand, procedures that depend on a known p (or on the assumption that p can
be determined by a bit of experimentation) like the models suggested by Almon [1],
Leainer [9], and Shiller [12]. The basic problem these formulations are intended

to solve is that of multicollinearity. The present paper assumes a known length
of the lag distribution. We will write equation (1) in matrix notation as
y = XB +

u.
The plan of the paper is as follows: In section 2 we outline the Almon

and Shiller procedures and show how they are related to the ridge estimators

—2—

suggested by Hoerl and Kennard [5]. We also discuss a Bayesian version of the
Almon estimator, different from that of Shiller, and show how it is related to
the ridge estimators and the estimator suggested by Lindley and Smith [10].
The next section reports the results obtained by the application of these methods

to two sets of data: one the set of data on capital appropriations and expenditures used by Almon and the other the data used by Griliches et al., [3] and

Zellner and Geisel [16]. The final section presents the conclusions of the paper.

2. The Models Considered
(a) The Almon Method: Basically the procedure is based on the assumption that
the

in (1) lie on a low degree polynomial. For the sake of illustration we

will assume that it is a quadratic.

One can also impose some end point constraints as Almon does, e.g..,
for i =

-1

and p+1. This implies two linear restrictions on the ct's in (2).

It has been often argued that the nice smooth shape that is usually obtained with
the Almon method is partly due to the imposition of the end point constraints.
Equation (2) can be written as

Then equation (4) implies the set of restrictions

Thus, to get Almon's estimator we minimize (y -

(y - X$) subject to (6).

The resulting estimator is (Theil [15], p. 143)

of 3.

(b) Shiller's Method: The basic argument in Shiller's method is that we often
specify a restriction such as (2) not because we believe in it but we believe
the lag distribution to be smooth and consider (2) as an approximation.
One can add an error term to (2) and write

This results in a complicated covariance matrix for the residuals. The residuals
are heteroscedastic and autocorrelated. The Bayesian formulation of (8) will be
discussed later.

Instead of making equation (2) stochastic, Shiller notes that assumption (2) implies that

to the expression in (7). However when we introduce the stochastic term, it makes

a difference whether we make (2) or (9) stochastic.

They suggest an iterative procedure to decide on a suitable k.
Instead of (14) we can consider a more general form

kQ)1

(15)

where Q is a positive semi-definite matrix and written this way it can be seen
that Shiller's estimator (12) is also a ridge estimator.
One can give a Bayesian interpretation to all these estimators and in

fact this way of looking at the estimators is more revealing. Consider the ridge
estimator (14), If the prior distribution of 8 is N(O,t21) then the mean of the
posterior distribution of 8 is given by (14) with k = c12/T2.

Instead, if we

assume the prior distribution of 8 to be N(6,t2) then the posterior distribution
of 8 is also normal with mean

The important point to note is that the commonly used ridge estimator
given by (14) implies a prior distribution for

with mean zero. This may not be

a plausible assumption to make in many applications and if so equation (16) or (17)

should be used. These modifications can be made very easily.
The Bayesian approach to the stochastic version of the Almon lag given
by (8) can easily be seen to yield the ridge estimator as the posterior mean.
Equation (8) can be written as

v

where H is defined in (4).
Following Lindley and Smith [10] we can say that

y "

N(Ho,

and

This still leaves us with the specification of the priors for c. We can assume
a diffuse prior for c. Lindley and Smith prove the following theorem:

If y "- N(A101,

This is the case considered by Lindley and Smith and for the sake of comparison
we computed this estimator too using the iterative procedure suggested by them.

3. The Results
For illustrative purposes we used two sets of data: one the data used
by Almon [1] and the other the data used by Griliches et al., [3].

The former

data consist of 60 observations and the latter of 56 observations. Tables (1)
and (2) present the correlation matrices for the two sets of data. These indicate how highly inter-correlated the variables are.
Tables (3) and (4) present the estimates obtained by using the OLS
method, the Lindley-Smith method, the Bayes-Almon method and Shiller's method.

In all cases the lag distribution was arbitrarily terminated at x8. For the
Bayes-Almon method we used a quadratic polynomial. As mentioned earlier, the
Lindley-Smith method is a particular case of the Bayes-Almon method and corre-

sponds to a zero-degree polynomial. Clearly the results given by this method
are not as satisfactory as those obtained by a second degree polynomial. We
report in the table the final value k* of k arrived at by the iterative procedure

and we also report the number of iterations after which things

but with the Almon data the value of k kept on increasing. In both cases

There is of course one problem with

changes. As mentioned earlier, the same iterative pro-

cedure used by Lindley and Smith can also be used for Shiller's method but we did

not pursue this avenue yet. In our computations we used a first degree smoothness prior for the estimation by Shiller's method. This implies a first degree
Almon polynomial.

We used the first degree smoothness prior because Shiller got good resuits with it in his paper and further it did capture the shape of a lag distri-

bution that first rises and then declines. Since the results in Tables 3 and 4
do not enable us to make an adequate comparison between Shiller's method and the

Bayes-Almon method, we recomputed the latter for the first degree polynomial. For
the Almon data the coefficients were respectively: .12116, .12857, .14052, .13647,

.12201, .10191, .09336, .07708, .06515. Sum = .98623 (convergence in 6 iterations).
For the consumption function data the coefficients were respectively: .55104,
.31501, .16258, -.15350, .00945, —.09091, .02169, .03385, .08655. Sum = .93576
(convergence in 7 iterations). These results show that there are substantial differences in the results produced by the two different ways of making the Almon

polynomial specification stochastic. The Shiller procedure has produced a smoother
lag distribution (particularly for the consumption function data) than the Bayes-Almon
procedure but the estimates of the lag coefficients (particularly the initial ones)

make more sense for the latter procedure. It is conceivable that the estimates
produced by the two methods come closer if we used a similar iterative procedure

for the Shiller method. But we have not pursued this further. It would be illuminating if we started with a known lag distribution and we are doing a Monte-Carlo
study of the performance of the iterated and non-iterated estimators for the dif-

ferent specifications of the models discussed here. Hopefully this will shed more
light on their relative performance.

-:i0-

The reason why the two pieces of data discussed here were selected is
that there do exist estimates obtained by other methods (Koyck, Solow, etc.) for

these data. These methods can he characterized as "strong parametric specifications"
because they imply a strong specification that the 's lie on a particular shaped
distribution. By contrast the methods discussed here are weak parametric speci-.

fications. We need not make an elaborate comparison here but the results obtained
suggest that the strong parametric specifications may be responsible for producing
some "plausible" -

but

distorted -

lag

shapes.

Finally, we come to the straight ridge method -

the method of Hoerl and

Kennard. We take

=

(X'X + kI)1

X'y

The usual procedure is to take X'X as the correlation matrix rather than the matrix

of variances and covariances (to avoid problems with units of measurement). This
merely amounts to multiplying the diagonal elements of the variance covariance

matrix X'X by (1+k). We computed the ridge estimates by this method. We did
not use an iterative procedure. Instead we used some trial values and one of

the values of k suggested by Paul Holland {6] viz. k1. We did not use the other
k's suggested by him because they involve an iterative computation. Holland's
suggestion was in the context of Robust regression but we simplified it for the

simple ridge method here. However, his suggested k did not work too well. For
the Almon data k'1 turned out to be negative (-.031). For the consumption function data it was .026. But for this value of k, the ridge estimator really

smoothed things out. The estimates of the parameters were: ,11099, .10967,
.10724, .10357, .10274, .10214, .10430, .10732, .11021. Sum = .95818.

Apart

from the fact that the sum is a bit high, the total is almost equally distributed

among all the coefficients. Hence we decided to see what the results look like

—11—

if k was reduced substantially. Table 5 presents the results for the consumption
function data, for different values of k. Since our experience with the ridge
regression is similar for the Almon data, we are not presenting the results here.

The one puzzling feature in the results is the large and stable coefficient for

x8. This is perhaps a consequence of some seasonal elements in the data that
we have not accounted for (a similar result did not appear for the Almon data).
But apart from this, what the results in Table 5 (and similar results with Almon
data not reported here) suggest is that the k for the simple Hoerl and Kennard

ridge method has to be really very low. For values of k even as low as 0.1 or
.005, the method really smooths things out. This also suggests the other modifications of the ridge method suggested earlier in the paper are more promising
than the Hoerl and Kennard method.

4. Conclusions
The paper explains how two different stochastic formulations of the
Almon polynomial method result in ridge estimators and how the Lindley-Smith pro-

cedure is also a special case of the Bayes-Almon method. All these methods have
been applied for illustrative purposes to two sets of data. The results show
that the ridge estimator of Hoerl arid Kennard and the extension given by Lindley

and Smith are not as promising for distributed lag estimation as the more general

methods such as the stochastic versions of the Almon polynomial method. There
are two ways of making the Almon polynomial method stochastic - one given by
Shiller and the other which is a straightforward application of the Lindley and

Smith procedure. The results presented, though inconclusive, suggest that the
latter procedure is perhaps more flexible than Shiller's. Shiller argues that he
does not have to specify a prior distribution for

-

all

he has to do is to

specify a prior for differences in the F.. However, this is only superficially
true. If we assume a first degree smoothness prior for F this leaves two of the

these parameters. Anyway the relative merits of the two procedures and the itera(say

tive versus non-iterative computation of k need more detailed study and the
results of some further empirical examples and some Monte Carlo experiments which
are under way will be presented elsewhere.
