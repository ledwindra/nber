    "abstract": "\n\nPrevious analyses of the cost of redistribution by a unitary government\nhave focussed on the welfare losses of distorted labor supply choices. On the\nother hand, the analysis of redistribution b,y local qovernments in a federal\nsystem has emphasized the effect of the migration of taxpayers and transfer\nrecipients in raising the cost (faced by state residents) of engaging in more\nredistribution. This paper combines both migration and labor supply effects\nto compute marginal redistribution costs at the state and federal level.\nSurprisingly, for a wide range of parameter values, states face lower\nredistribution costs than the national government because they are able to\n\"export\" some of the cost through lower federal tax revenue. The normative\nimplication of the analysis is that any case for national redistribution\npolicies must be based on benefit spillovers across state lines rather than on\ntax competition among state governments.\n\n",
