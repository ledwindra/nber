    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper studies the supply of and demand for moral values in recent U.S. presidential elections. Using a combination of large-scale survey data and text analyses, I find support for the hypothesis that both voters and politicians exhibit heterogeneity in their emphasis on universalist relative to communal moral values, and that politicians\u2019 vote shares partly reflect the extent to which their moral appeal matches the values of the electorate. Over the last decade, Americans\u2019 values have become increasingly communal \u2013 especially in rural areas \u2013 which generated increased moral polarization and is associated with changes in voting patterns across space.\n\n",
