ABSTRACT
To clarify and interpret the workings of a large computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of
environmental policy in the U.S., we build an aggregated Cobb-Douglas (CD) model that can be
solved easily and analytically. Its closed-form expressions show exactly how key parameters
determine the sign and size of effects from a large new carbon tax on emissions, revenue, prices,
output, and welfare. Data and parameters from the detailed, dynamic CGE model of Goulder and
Hafstead (2018) are used in the CD model to calculate results that can be compared with theirs.
Results from the CD model track those from the large CGE model quite closely, even though the
CD model omits much detail such as the number of sectors, intermediate inputs, and international
trade. A CGE model is quite useful to generate detailed numerical results and to reflect on
particular aspects of environmental policy, but the simpler CD model provides a transparent view
of exactly how the policy affects key outcomes.

Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models are large numerical simulation
models that apply detailed economic data to a model of producer and consumer behavior in a
general framework to calculate supply, demand, and equilibrium prices across a great number
of markets simultaneously. Such models have been widely used to study the effects of
environmental regulation on the entire economy, including emissions, outputs, prices, tax
revenue, and economics welfare. 1 The most recent and fully described CGE model for climate
policy is in the book by Goulder and Hafstead (GH, 2018). It analyzes the myriad effects of a
carbon tax, a cap-and-trade system, and some alternatives to emissions pricing. It includes not
only careful modeling of the carbon-intensity of each different production sector, but also the
intertemporal dynamics of all U.S. taxes on labor supply, investment, and the incomes of
different household groups. The model is quite useful, but many readers who do not build
their own CGE models may find the sheer size and complexity of such models impenetrable.
To understand such models, and to show exactly what features of the model drive key
results, this paper builds a new but simplified Cobb-Douglas (CD) version of a CGE model
that can be solved on “the back of an envelope” – using not a computer, but just paper, pencil,
and a calculator. We use industry data from GH (2018) to calculate factor shares, elasticities,
and tax rates. Then we perform the same kinds of simulations using the CD model to show
how to solve for new post-reform general equilibrium prices and quantities. The CD model
has only three sectors and four inputs, and it has no input-output matrix nor dynamics. Our
results, therefore, must differ to some degree from those of Goulder and Hafstead, but we
show that the simple model can generate results that are surprisingly close to those of the
complicated CGE model. We also show derivations that are very transparent.
We believe this paper makes three contributions. First, it will be extremely useful for
teaching general equilibrium or for teaching environmental economics – particularly pollution
tax incidence and effects on economic efficiency. For the imposition of a pollution tax, this
paper will show step-by-step derivations of all outcomes such as each quantity of output and
its price, each input and its price, pollution, abatement costs, and money-metric utility
measures of changes in household welfare (equivalent variations). Others have used Cobb-

-2Douglas examples for teaching, but none of those is published, analytical, and available. 2
Second, and more importantly, our paper provides an interpretation and commentary
on Goulder and Hafstead (2018), the newest and most complete description of a large CGE
model. This detailed model is fully capable of analyzing many facets of the U.S. economy, the
tax system, and various proposed climate policies. But readers who do not build CGE models
themselves may find it hard to penetrate its complexities. Our simpler exposition here is
useful to understand the nature of this large, complicated CGE model. Moreover, its results
are quite similar. While the complex model is necessary to get detailed numerical results on
particular industries, and to solve for adjustment costs during transitions, we show that the
detail is not necessary to understand the model nor to get broadly similar results.
In particular, we use their data and their calibration of parameters, adjusted to fit our
more aggregated and simpler model. We then use the CD model to study the same questions
as in Goulder and Hafstead: what are the effects of a pollution tax when its revenue is rebated
to households in a lump-sum fashion or when its revenue is recycled to cut the labor tax? We
compare results from our aggregated CD model to results from their dynamic disaggregated
CGE model. For impacts of a carbon tax with either lump-sum rebates or with revenue used to
cut labor taxes, our simpler model yields key results quite similar to theirs for carbon dioxide
emissions, carbon tax revenue, and welfare costs of the carbon tax.
A third contribution is that we show how to use the simple CD model to analyze three
other questions not studied by Goulder and Hafstead (2018). We calculate and show the entire
marginal abatement cost curve for each type of carbon tax and revenue use. We calculate and
show the second-best optimal rate of tax for each such policy. And we further explore the
effect of a carbon tax in only one sector on emissions from the other sector (“leakage”).
These results further demonstrate the usefulness of the simple model.
The first section of our paper describes the basic Cobb-Douglas model, and the second
section shows how to solve it on the back of an envelope for expressions that show the impact
of parameters on outcomes such as emissions, revenue, outputs, prices, and economic welfare.
An appendix shows how we aggregate data and parameters from Goulder and Hafstead into

A Cobb-Douglas example appears in the lecture notes of James Markusen (2018), but to obtain those lecture
notes would require knowledge of their existence and sending an email to ask for them. Thomas Rutherford
(1999) and Shoven and Whalley (1984, 1992) also provide simplified CGE models for pedagogical purposes, but
solutions for these models require a computer. Kimbell and Harrison (1986) provide analytical solutions for
more complicated models with constant elasticity of substitution production. In contrast, the goal here is to
provide a complete and comprehensive Cobb-Douglas example in published form that can be solved analytically.

calculate those outcomes and to interpret results. The fourth section compares those CD
model results to the detailed results of Goulder and Hafstead (2018). The fifth section reports
other results from our CD model. The sixth section discusses key findings and concludes.
1. Model Description
Here, we develop a simplified Cobb-Douglas version of a CGE model. We assume a
closed economy with a large number 𝑛𝑛 of identical households, perfect competition, perfect

�)
mobility, and no uncertainty. Each household is endowed with a fixed amount of capital (𝐾𝐾
and a fixed amount of time available for labor (𝐿𝐿�). Each get utility from consumption of a

composite good 𝑋𝑋, plus direct consumption by the household of electricity 𝐸𝐸𝐻𝐻 , fossil fuels 𝐹𝐹𝐻𝐻 ,

and leisure or home production 𝐿𝐿𝐻𝐻 . In our model, household utility over consumption goods
takes the Cobb-Douglas form: 3

𝑈𝑈 = 𝑈𝑈(𝑋𝑋, 𝐸𝐸𝐻𝐻 , 𝐹𝐹𝐻𝐻 , 𝐿𝐿𝐻𝐻 ) = 𝑋𝑋 𝑎𝑎 𝐸𝐸𝐻𝐻𝑏𝑏 𝐹𝐹𝐻𝐻𝑐𝑐 𝐿𝐿1−𝑎𝑎−𝑏𝑏−𝑐𝑐
𝐻𝐻

(1.1)

Consumers maximize that utility subject to their budget, but their welfare also negatively
depends on total emissions of carbon dioxide (𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛) from the use of fossil fuels. We assume a
constant marginal effect on welfare from emissions, 𝜃𝜃, so full welfare is 𝑈𝑈 − 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃. With many
identical households, each ignores the impact of their own emissions on total emissions 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛.
In this simplified Cobb-Douglas model, goods are produced according to: 4

𝑋𝑋 = 𝑋𝑋(𝐾𝐾𝑋𝑋 , 𝐿𝐿𝑋𝑋 , 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 , 𝐹𝐹𝑋𝑋 ) = 𝐴𝐴𝐾𝐾𝑋𝑋𝛼𝛼 𝐿𝐿𝑋𝑋 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 𝐹𝐹𝑋𝑋

𝐶𝐶 = 𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌

(1.5)

Production functions are all assumed to be Cobb-Douglas, but total-factor productivity (TFP)
parameters differ (denoted 𝐴𝐴, 𝐵𝐵, and 𝐺𝐺). Production of 𝑋𝑋 requires capital 𝐾𝐾𝑋𝑋 , labor 𝐿𝐿𝑋𝑋 ,
3

In contrast, the GH model uses constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility between consumption and
leisure, but a Cobb Douglas form to combine different goods into a composite consumption good. We comment
later on which differences between the models are most relevant to driving differences in results.

Constant returns to scale (CRTS) removes any importance of the scale of production, so we define all inputs
and outputs as amounts per household. The GH model includes 𝑋𝑋 as a potential input to 𝑋𝑋, 𝐸𝐸, and 𝐹𝐹.

-4electricity 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 , and direct use of fossil fuels 𝐹𝐹𝑋𝑋 . Production of electricity itself requires

capital 𝐾𝐾𝐸𝐸 , labor 𝐿𝐿𝐸𝐸 , and fossil fuels 𝐹𝐹𝐸𝐸 . Fossil fuels are produced using labor, 𝐿𝐿𝐹𝐹 , only. 5 In

our model, emissions are proportional to fossil fuel use, where a unit of fossil fuels emits 𝜌𝜌
tons of carbon dioxide, 𝐶𝐶.

In this static model, households have no saving decision; the capital stock is fixed. 6

Households allocate their fixed time endowment between labor supply (𝐿𝐿) and leisure (𝐿𝐿𝐻𝐻 ).

The government levies a tax 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿 on market labor income and provides a lump-sum transfer of
all tax revenue back to households as a per-household lump-sum rebate (𝑅𝑅). This tax rate is
defined as a fraction of the net wage or price of labor (𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 ), so the gross wage is 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 (1 + 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿 ).

We consider a policy reform that raises the pollution tax and uses all added revenue to cut the
distorting labor tax (holding constant the initial level of government transfers).
This reform can include a tax 𝜏𝜏𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 per metric ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in

the production of electricity and a tax 𝜏𝜏𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 per metric ton of CO2 emissions from all “other”

uses of fossil fuels. Given a fixed ratio of emissions to fossil fuel use, 𝜌𝜌, each such rate is

equivalent to a tax at rate 𝜌𝜌𝜏𝜏𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 per unit of fossil fuel used in electricity and 𝜌𝜌𝜏𝜏𝐶𝐶0 per unit of

fossil fuel used in other sectors (𝐹𝐹𝐻𝐻 and 𝐹𝐹𝑋𝑋 ). For simplicity, we ignore taxes on output and on

capital, in order to focus only on the possible carbon tax in the presence of a pre-existing

labor tax. The government budget constraint says that the sum of pollution tax revenues and
labor tax revenues equals the lump-sum tax rebate: 7
𝑅𝑅 = 𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝐹𝐹𝐸𝐸 + 𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝐹𝐹𝐻𝐻 + 𝐹𝐹𝑋𝑋 ) + 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 𝐿𝐿

(1.6)

We can then show how this simple model produces the standard “double dividend” results
when we calculate the effects of a carbon tax with revenue used to reduce the labor tax. We
will also discuss two different kinds of carbon tax: a uniform tax on all carbon or a tax on
carbon only in the electricity sector.

5

Production of fuels are capital intensive in GH, but adding capital to fuel production here would complicate our
derivations and solutions. A different simplification could combine labor and capital into one composite input,
but then we would have to use the labor tax rate from GH on the composite input, or else adjust the tax rate. Our
simplified model is not “accurate”, but still can obtain results close to those from the GH model.
6

In contrast, GH have a dynamic model with quasi-fixed capital, giving rise to adjustment costs that imply
windfall gains or losses with important distributional implications. GH also obtain short-run impacts that differ
from long-run impacts. In these respects, we cannot compare our results to theirs, because (1) our static CD
model has no such dynamics, and (2) we have only one type of household and thus no distributional results.
7

In contrast, the government sector in the GH model provides fixed real transfers and services, where services
are produced using labor, capital, fuel, electricity, and other inputs.

-5Households choose their consumption of goods and leisure to maximize utility subject
to their budget constraint, which requires that their “full” income (𝐼𝐼) not be exceeded by the
sum of expenditures on the composite good, electricity, fossil fuel, and leisure. Their full
income includes receipts from fixed factor endowments and the lump-sum tax rebate:
� + 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 𝐿𝐿� + 𝑅𝑅 = 𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 𝑋𝑋 + 𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 𝐸𝐸𝐻𝐻 + (𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹 + 𝜌𝜌𝜏𝜏𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 )𝐹𝐹𝐻𝐻 + 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 𝐿𝐿𝐻𝐻
𝐼𝐼 = 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 𝐾𝐾

where 𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 and 𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 are prices faced by consumers. Also, 𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹 denotes the net-of-tax price of fossil

fuels, so 𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹 + 𝜌𝜌𝜏𝜏𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 is the price faced by consumers (gross of tax). The rental price for capital

is denoted as 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 and is untaxed. Only relative prices matter in our general equilibrium model,
so we anchor the overall price level by assuming that the nominal amount of full income is
fixed (𝐼𝐼 = 𝐼𝐼 )̅ . Then the Cobb-Douglas utility function implies that expenditure on each
consumption good is also fixed (as a fraction of that fixed income):
𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 𝑋𝑋 = 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎

(𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹 + 𝜌𝜌𝜏𝜏𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 )𝐹𝐹𝐻𝐻 = 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐

(1.9)

𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 𝐸𝐸𝐻𝐻 = 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏

(1.8)

𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 𝐿𝐿𝐻𝐻 = (1 − 𝑎𝑎 − 𝑏𝑏 − 𝑐𝑐)𝐼𝐼

(1.10)

Competitive firms are price takers in input and output markets, and they choose input
quantities to maximize profits subject to their production functions. The Cobb-Douglas forms
yield very simple factor demands. For example, firms in 𝑋𝑋 always use 𝛼𝛼 of net sales revenue,

𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 𝑋𝑋, to buy units of capital 𝐾𝐾𝑋𝑋 , each of which cost 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 . Similarly, for other inputs:
𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 𝐾𝐾𝑋𝑋 = 𝛼𝛼𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 𝑋𝑋

(1.11)

𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 = 𝛾𝛾𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 𝑋𝑋

(1.13)

𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 𝐾𝐾𝐸𝐸 = 𝛿𝛿𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 𝐸𝐸

(1.15)

𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 (1 + 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿 )𝐿𝐿𝑋𝑋 = 𝛽𝛽𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 𝑋𝑋

(1.12)

(𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹 + 𝜌𝜌𝜏𝜏𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 )𝐹𝐹𝑋𝑋 = (1 − 𝛼𝛼 − 𝛽𝛽 − 𝛾𝛾)𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 𝑋𝑋

(1.14)

𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 (1 + 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿 )𝐿𝐿𝐸𝐸 = 𝜖𝜖𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 𝐸𝐸

(1.16)

-6(𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹 + 𝜌𝜌𝜏𝜏𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 )𝐹𝐹𝐸𝐸 = (1 − 𝛿𝛿 − 𝜖𝜖)𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 𝐸𝐸
𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 (1 + 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿 )𝐿𝐿𝐹𝐹 = 𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹 𝐹𝐹

(1.17)
(1.18)

In our Cobb-Douglas economy, the three conditions for general equilibrium are
income balance, zero profit, and market clearance. Income balance conditions are the
household and government budget constraints above. The zero profit conditions say that the
value of output produced by each industry must equal the sum of the values of inputs
employed in production [satisfied by equations (1.11) – (1.18)]. Market clearing implies that
the total quantity of each commodity (e.g., 𝐹𝐹 or 𝐸𝐸) supplied by firms must equal the total
quantity demanded [in equations (1.3) and (1.4) above]. In addition, the quantity of each

primary factor used in all sectors must sum to the household’s endowment of that factor:
� = 𝐾𝐾𝑋𝑋 + 𝐾𝐾𝐸𝐸
𝐾𝐾

𝐿𝐿� = 𝐿𝐿 + 𝐿𝐿𝐻𝐻 = 𝐿𝐿𝑋𝑋 + 𝐿𝐿𝐸𝐸 + 𝐿𝐿𝐹𝐹 + 𝐿𝐿𝐻𝐻

(1.19)
(1.20)

All equations above hold in the initial equilibrium (indicated by superscript “o”) and
in the new equilibrium (with primes). For a change in uniform carbon tax rate from 𝜏𝜏𝐶𝐶o to 𝜏𝜏𝐶𝐶′ ,

we can then compare outcomes such as new emissions 𝐶𝐶 ′ to old emissions 𝐶𝐶 𝑜𝑜 .
2. Deriving New Equilibrium Outcomes

This section is designed to demonstrate the simplicity and ease of successive
substitution to solve for the new general equilibrium prices and quantities “on the back of an
envelope”. We study four of the GH model’s scenarios: (1) a uniform carbon tax with lumpsum rebate, (2) a uniform carbon tax with a labor tax cut, (3) a carbon tax on the electricity
sector only with lump-sum rebate, and (4) a carbon tax on the electricity sector only with a
labor tax cut. In this section, we show the first ten equations that pertain to all of those
scenarios, which are enough to demonstrate the method. Then Appendix A shows remaining
additional steps, including details that differ for each of the four scenarios.
First, of course, Cobb-Douglas forms yield very simple factor demands. Equations
(1.7) and (1.11) yield (2.1), while (1.13) and (1.15) yield (2.2):
𝐾𝐾𝑋𝑋′ =

𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾′
𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾′

(2.2)

Substitute (2.1) and (2.2) into the market-clearing condition (1.19) and manipulate to derive
an expression for the new factor price of capital:
𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾′ =

𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼 + 𝛿𝛿(𝑏𝑏 + 𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾)
𝐼𝐼
�
𝐾𝐾

(2.3)

Then substitute (2.3) back into (2.1) and (2.2) to solve for new uses of capital 𝐾𝐾𝑋𝑋′ and 𝐾𝐾𝐸𝐸′ .
Since full income includes receipts from the lump-sum tax rebate and fixed factor

endowments (labor and capital), that 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾′ in (2.3) can be used to find the net-of-tax wage as:
𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿′ =

� − 𝑅𝑅′
𝐼𝐼 − 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾′ 𝐾𝐾
𝐿𝐿�

(2.4)

Then use labor demands in (1.12), (1.16), and (1.18), plus the market-clearing equation (1.20)
to obtain labor used in each sector. With 𝐹𝐹 ′ = 𝐺𝐺𝐿𝐿′𝐹𝐹 , these equations yield:
𝐿𝐿′𝑋𝑋 =

𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽
𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿′ (1 + 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿′ )

𝐿𝐿′𝐸𝐸 =

𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿′ (1 + 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿′ )

𝐹𝐹 ′ = 𝐺𝐺𝐿𝐿′𝐹𝐹 = 𝐺𝐺(𝐿𝐿�−𝐿𝐿′𝐻𝐻 − 𝐿𝐿′𝑋𝑋 − 𝐿𝐿′𝐸𝐸 )

(2.6)

(2.8)

The production of fossil fuels (1.4) and zero profit condition (1.18) yield the first equation for
the price of fuel below, and the expression for 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿′ in equation (2.4) yields the second:

𝐿𝐿�𝐺𝐺

(2.9)

In the case with lump-sum rebate of carbon revenue, we assume no change in labor tax
rate (𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿′ = 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿𝑜𝑜 ). Given the solution for 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾′ in (2.3), the only unknown on the right side of (2.9)
is 𝑅𝑅′. Our approach is to express all other unknown outcomes as functions of the equilibrium

rebate 𝑅𝑅′. Then we solve for 𝑅𝑅′ and substitute back to get all other outcomes. For example, for
′
′
the uniform carbon tax case (𝜏𝜏𝐶𝐶′ = 𝜏𝜏𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶
= 𝜏𝜏𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶
), we use the government budget (1.6) to get:

𝑅𝑅′ = 𝜌𝜌𝜏𝜏𝐶𝐶′ (𝐹𝐹𝑋𝑋′ + 𝐹𝐹𝐸𝐸′ + 𝐹𝐹𝐻𝐻′ ) + 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿′ 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿′ (𝐿𝐿′𝑋𝑋 + 𝐿𝐿′𝐸𝐸 + 𝐿𝐿′𝐹𝐹 ),

-8and manipulate to derive the new equilibrium total quantity of fossil fuels:
𝐹𝐹 ′ =

� − 𝑅𝑅′) + 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿′ (1 − 𝑎𝑎 − 𝑏𝑏 − 𝑐𝑐)𝐼𝐼

=
𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌𝐶𝐶′
𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌𝐶𝐶′

(2.10)

We equate equations (2.8) and (2.10) and insert expressions for 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾′ from equation (2.3) and 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿′
from equation (2.4) to solve for 𝑅𝑅′.

In the case with labor tax recycling, an increase in carbon tax revenue is offset by a cut

in labor tax rate, with no change in rebate (𝑅𝑅 ′ = 𝑅𝑅 𝑜𝑜 ). Our approach in this case is to express
all unknown variables as functions of the new labor tax rate 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿′ . Then we solve for 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿′ and

substitute back that expression for 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿′ to obtain other new equilibrium outcomes. For example,

for the uniform carbon tax case, we equate (2.8) and (2.10) to solve for 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿′ . Remaining steps

are all listed explicitly in Appendix A. Here, we proceed to solve for welfare.

Demand functions for consumption goods and leisure are obtained from expenditure
share equations (1.7)-(1.10). Here, we substitute these demands into the utility function (1.1) to
obtain the indirect utility function:

as the “ideal” price index,

a function of all prices faced by households. 8 The result is a simple expression for indirect
utility, 𝑈𝑈 = 𝐼𝐼/𝑃𝑃� . We then invert that function to obtain the expenditure function 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸(𝑈𝑈, 𝑃𝑃� ):
𝐼𝐼 = 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸(𝑈𝑈, 𝑃𝑃�) = 𝑈𝑈 × 𝑃𝑃�

In the case with fixed full income, Mas-Colell et al. (1995, p.82) show that the equivalent
variation can be measured as:
𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 = 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸(𝑃𝑃�𝑜𝑜 , 𝑈𝑈 ′ ) − 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸(𝑃𝑃�′ , 𝑈𝑈 ′ ) = 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸(𝑃𝑃�𝑜𝑜 , 𝑈𝑈 ′ ) − 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸(𝑃𝑃�𝑜𝑜 , 𝑈𝑈 𝑜𝑜 )

In the Cobb-Douglas case,

� , 𝐿𝐿�, and 𝐼𝐼 )̅ . Following other
Following prior literature, the bars over earlier variables indicate they are fixed (𝐾𝐾
literature, however, the bar over 𝑃𝑃� is used to represent the “ideal” price index. Since all prices can change from
the old equilibrium to new equilibrium, the value of this price index can change (from 𝑃𝑃�𝑜𝑜 to 𝑃𝑃� ′ ).

8

-9𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 = 𝑃𝑃�𝑜𝑜 × 𝑈𝑈 ′ − 𝑃𝑃�𝑜𝑜 × 𝑈𝑈 𝑜𝑜 = 𝑃𝑃�𝑜𝑜 (𝑈𝑈 ′ − 𝑈𝑈 𝑜𝑜 )

This expression has a ready interpretation, since households essentially purchase “utils” at the
price 𝑃𝑃� per util. Then the equivalent variation is the change in non-environmental utility
(𝑈𝑈 ′ − 𝑈𝑈 𝑜𝑜 ) valued at old prices (𝑃𝑃�𝑜𝑜 ), while the compensating variation (CV) is the same
change in 𝑈𝑈 valued at new prices (𝑃𝑃� ′ ).

We calibrate this model to the U.S. economy in a way that allows us to study multiple

questions as listed above. In each case, we compare results from our simple aggregated CD
model to results from the large, dynamic, disaggregated CGE model in GH (2018). To see
how results depend on model structure per se, we compare results of the two models using the
same data and parameters. Therefore, we use the data and calibration from GH, adjusted to fit
our more aggregated and simpler model. We also supplement their data with GDP by industry
from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and primary energy use by source from the U.S.
Energy Information Administration. Table 1 summarizes data and parameters for our CD
model. All details of this calibration are shown in Appendix B. We undertake the same kinds
of simulations as in GH, but using the CD model, and we show how to solve for new postreform general equilibrium prices and quantities.
3. Derive and Interpret Numerical Results
We study the effects of a large change in the carbon tax on prices, inputs, outputs, and
welfare. 9 In GH’s central case, the carbon tax starts at $6.67 per metric ton in 2017, rises to
$20 in 2019, and then increases by 4% every year until it reaches $67 in 2050. This section
illustrates how to obtain simple numerical results, so we first calculate effects of introducing
an arbitrary round-number tax of $15 per metric ton on all sectors’ CO2 emissions while using
additional revenue to cut the labor tax rate. Table 2 summarizes key outcomes. The first two
columns list variables and their definitions. The third column shows benchmark equilibrium
values with no carbon tax (from GH’s data and our calibration). Column 4 presents the new
equilibrium after implementing the carbon tax with labor tax recycling, which we solve using
use all equations above. Column 5 of Table 2 presents percentage changes for key variables.
Impacts on Outputs, Inputs, and Prices
The carbon tax with revenue recycling implies no change in tax revenue, so a higher
9

The model framework can be used to study other environmental policies, but we focus on carbon pricing.

-10emissions tax rate must be accompanied by a reduced labor tax rate. With fixed nominal
income 𝐼𝐼, the net-of-tax wage and capital price are unchanged (in the bottom two rows of

Table 2), but the cut in labor tax reduces the gross-of-tax wage cost (by 1.04%, not shown).
Because of our simplifying assumption that the production of fossil fuels uses only labor in
production, a tax on CO2 is equivalently a tax on fossil fuels or on labor used in production of
fossil fuels. Table 2 shows that both 𝐹𝐹 and 𝐿𝐿𝐹𝐹 fall by the same percentage (10.6%).

The first three rows of Table 2 show the impact of the carbon tax on outputs, where

fossil fuels is the output most affected. Though the table shows that the net-of-tax price of
𝐹𝐹 received by producers falls by -1.04%, the gross-of-tax cost of fossil fuels increases 12%

(from $1/unit to $1.12/unit, not shown in Table 2). The production of electricity is much more
fossil-fuel intensive than the production of 𝑋𝑋 (the composite good). 10 Thus, due to the rise in
the fuel input price, the consumer price of 𝐸𝐸 rises by 4.5%, and output of 𝐸𝐸 falls by 4.3%. In
contrast, the consumer price of 𝑋𝑋 falls by only 0.058% (and output of 𝑋𝑋 rises by 0.058%).

The next nine rows of Table 2 show impacts of this reform on uses of primary factors

in each sector. No change is reported in the use of capital, since the factor price of capital is
unchanged (and our static model considers a fixed supply of factor endowments). The 10.6%
reduction in labor used by sector 𝐹𝐹 allows for labor use in larger sectors 𝑋𝑋 and 𝐸𝐸 to rise by
1.05%. Total labor supply does not change, so labor use at home (𝐿𝐿𝐻𝐻 ) is also unaffected. 11

Cobb-Douglas utility and production functions ensure that the values of fossil fuels

and electricity used in production and at home are fixed proportions of fixed nominal income.
So changes in fossil fuels and electricity are proportional to changes in their prices. Also,
since the carbon tax is levied on all sectors, they all face the same gross-of-tax price of fossil
fuels (𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹 + 𝜌𝜌𝜏𝜏𝐶𝐶 ). Thus, the percentage change in fossil fuels used in each sector is the same as
the percentage change in total fossil fuels 𝐹𝐹. Similarly, the percentage change in electricity
deployed in each sector is the same as the percentage change in total electricity 𝐸𝐸.
Impacts on Welfare

In our numerical results, the EV is -$7.996 billion from this tax-swap experiment – the
10

Panel B of Table 1 shows that the cost share for fossil fuels in the production of the composite good (0.023) is
much less than its cost share in the production of electricity (0.407).
11

Cobb-Douglas utility means that households spend a fixed fraction of fixed nominal income on each good
(e.g., 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 𝐿𝐿𝐻𝐻 = (1 − 𝑎𝑎 − 𝑏𝑏 − 𝑐𝑐)𝐼𝐼). The unchanged net-of-tax wage 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 then implies unchanged 𝐿𝐿𝐻𝐻 . Yet this result
is consistent with numerical findings in GH, given their choice of elasticities (see GH’s Table 5.7, p.106).

-11introduction of a $15 tax per metric ton of CO2 with revenue used to cut the labor tax rate
from 60.2% to 58.6% of the net wage. Since the reform reduces welfare, this EV is negative,
so we reverse its sign to represent the positive cost of the policy. The EV shows that the
higher CO2 tax has a negative effect on welfare that exceeds the positive effect of reducing
the wage tax. Thus, in our numerical model, the revenue-neutral substitution of the pollution
tax for an existing distortionary labor tax has a positive gross cost. 12
How big is this welfare loss? We divide total welfare loss from the policy by total CO2
abated to obtain the average abatement cost (AAC). In our example, the tax-swap experiment
reduces 0.570 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions compared to the benchmark, so
the AAC is $14.03 per ton (=7.996/0.570). This AAC means that on average, and before
considering the environment-related benefit, the tax-swap reform costs $14.03 to reduce each
metric ton of CO2 emissions. Below, we show marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves.
By including the amount of carbon dioxide emissions in the welfare function (𝑊𝑊 =

𝑈𝑈 − 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃), we are also able to calculate environmental benefits and thus net benefits of the

reform. The environmental benefit of the tax reform is total emission reduction (0.57 billion
tons) times the social cost of carbon (SCC). GH use the U.S. government’s estimate of SCC =
$43 per metric ton of CO2. 13 Thus, after accounting for the environment-related benefit
(0.570billion×43=$B 24.52), the reform offers a net welfare gain of $B 16.52.
4. Comparisons to Results from the Large CGE Model
As shown in previous sections, our simplified Cobb-Douglas GE model can be solved
by readers using a paper and pencil on the back of an envelope. That is an advantage relative
to large CGE models whose sheer size and complexity can make them impenetrable for many
readers who do not build their own CGE models. Thus, the simple Cobb-Douglas GE model
with its great accessibility allows readers to explore and understand exactly and explicitly
what features of the model drive key results. And especially, it assists new researchers who
seek to build their first own CGE models to decide what features to include in their models.

12

Thus, these numerical results do not support the “strong double dividend” claim, defined by Goulder (1995) as
the assertion that the environmental tax not only improves the environment but also increases non-environmental
welfare through revenue recycling. GH study welfare costs of a carbon tax under various recycling methods such
as cuts in payroll tax, individual income tax, or corporate tax. They find evidence of a strong double dividend
only with low abatement amounts and with corporate income tax cuts.
13

-12In this section, we show that the simple model generates results that are similar to
those of a complicated CGE model but for which derivations are much more transparent. In
particular, we compare results from our simple aggregated Cobb-Douglas GE model to results
from the dynamic disaggregated CGE model of Goulder and Hafstead (2018). The book by
GH includes not only careful modeling of carbon-intensity of each different production sector,
but also of intertemporal dynamics and of all U.S. taxes on labor, on capital, and on the
incomes of different household income groups. For our purpose and length restriction in this
paper, we do not undertake every simulation in GH. Instead, we analyze effects of a carbon
tax with lump-sum rebates and with revenue used to reduce employee payroll taxes, which
enables direct comparison of our results to their results. 14
We note several key differences between our model and their model. First, our CobbDouglas model implies unitary elasticities of substitution in both consumption and
production, while GH’s elasticities of substitutions are constant but can be different from
one. 15 Second, the Cobb-Douglas model implies that the uncompensated leisure demand
elasticity is -1. Thus, if we use GH’s assumption that workers spend 66% of their time at work
and 34% of their time as leisure, the uncompensated labor supply is 1×0.34/0.66=0.515, while
the GH’s uncompensated labor supply is 0.05. Third, for simplicity, our model assumes away
all other taxes on capital and goods and considers only a preexisting tax on labor. 16 GH
include treatments of various ad-valorem sales and exercise taxes, plus tax deductions and tax
credits. 17 Fourth, as mentioned above, our model is a static GE model, while GH is a dynamic
model with growth. Fifth, our aggregated model cannot consider distributional impacts across
industries or household groups, as can the GH disaggregated model. GH also include import
and export activities in their model, while the economy is closed in our model. Therefore, we
certainly expect our results to differ to some degree from those of GH.
Goulder and Hafstead in their book study different carbon tax time profiles from 2016
to 2050. In their central case, the carbon tax starts at $6.67 in 2017, followed by $13.33 in

14

GH consider four revenue recycling methods of a carbon tax revenue, such as: lump-sum rebates, cuts in
employee payroll taxes, cuts in individual income taxes, and cuts in corporate income taxes.
15

Most elasticities of substitution range from 0.5 to 1.10, see Table 4.3 on Page 64 of GH.

16

Our Cobb-Douglas model can easily accommodate other taxes on goods and capital, but we want to keep our
model as simple as possible while still sufficient for the pedagogical purpose as well as for our main point that a
simple Cobb-Douglas GE model can yield similar results to a complicated CGE model.

-132018, $20 in 2019, and increases 4% every year after 2020 until it is capped at $60 in 2048,
2049, and 2050. Our model is static, but we vary our tax rates from $5 to $60. We treat each
tax rate as a separate new equilibrium. Then we calculate outputs, inputs, prices, emissions,
and welfare at each tax rate. We plot those equilibrium outcomes against increasing levels of
the carbon tax, and then we compare our plots with analogous plots from GH.
First, we compare the resulting impacts on economy-wide carbon emissions from our
CD model and their CGE model. Since GH only shows the time profile for CO2 in the case of
a carbon tax with lump-sum rebates, we present a similar plot in Figure 1, which shows tax
rates in ascending order from left to right on the horizontal axis and corresponding levels of
emissions on the vertical axis. The dashed line shows results from our CD model, and the
solid line represents GH’s results. 18 The figure shows that a more stringent carbon tax policy
results in a lower level of emissions. The solid line for the GH results and the dashed line for
the CD results are very close to each other. Emissions fall by more than one-third from 5.3
billion metric tons in the initial equilibrium with no carbon tax to less than 3.5 billion metric
tons by the year 2050, both in the GH model and in our Cobb-Douglas model when the
carbon tax reaches $60 per metric ton (the 2050 tax rate in GH).
Second, also only for the case with lump-sum rebate, GH’s Figure 5.4 on page 92
shows the time profile of carbon tax revenues (for years with rising tax rates). Similarly, we
plot gross and net carbon tax revenues from our CD model against carbon tax rates in Figure
2. Gross carbon tax revenue is the product of the carbon tax rate and total CO2 emissions. We
also calculate the GH definition of net carbon tax revenue, which equals the gross carbon tax
revenue minus the “tax-base effect”. In GH, the tax-base effect refers to impacts of the carbon
tax policy on the base of other taxes and thus on revenues generated by those taxes. In our CD
model, the labor tax is the only other tax, so the tax-base effect is measured here by changes
in labor tax revenue due to the imposition of the carbon tax. The solid lines show results from
the GH model, and dashed lines show results from the CD model. Heavier lines present gross
revenues, while lighter lines are net revenues. For example, the carbon tax rate in 2019 is $20
per metric ton, with a gross revenue of about $B100 in the GH model (about the same as for a
rate of $20 in the CD model). Gross revenue reaches about $B230 by 2050 in GH with their

18

In a similar figure, GH show emissions on the vertical axis and year on the horizontal axis, for both their
reference case with no carbon tax and their central case with a carbon tax and lump-sum rebates (their Figure 5.5
on p. 90). In Figure 1 here, we replace their horizontal time axis with each year’s corresponding tax rate.

-14tax rate of $60/ton, or at the tax rate of $60 in the CD model.
Figure 2 shows that gross tax revenues from our CD model and the GH model follow
each other closely as carbon tax rates rise. Accounting for the tax base effect, however,
impacts on net carbon tax revenue are much smaller and rather flat. Net carbon tax revenue is
higher and steeper in our CD model than in the GH model, which can be explained by the fact
that our model considers only the preexisting labor tax while GH have other preexisting taxes.
Thus, our tax-base effect is less than their tax-base effect. 19
Third, GH provide thorough welfare analysis of carbon tax policy under different
recycling methods. They calculate various measures of the policy costs such as percent GDP
reduction, welfare costs per ton of CO2 reduced, or welfare costs per dollar of gross revenue.
In particular, their Figure 5.6 graphs welfare cost per ton of emissions reduced against percent
emission reductions, so our Figure 3 plots their results as well as our calculated welfare cost
per ton of emissions reduced (average abatement cost, ignoring environmental benefits).
Again, solid lines show GH results, while dashed lines are CD results. Heavier lines show the
case of lump-sum rebates, and lighter lines show the labor tax recycling scenario.
Our welfare costs per ton of abatement follow the GH results closely. It is especially
close for the labor tax recycling scenario, because the labor tax cut raises the real net wage by
almost exactly the same amount that the carbon tax reduces it. And, for this reason, both our
model and the GH model find no or little change in total labor supply. Thus, the difference in
labor supply elasticities between our CD model and the GH model does not affect the welfare
cost calculation. But, in the lump-sum rebate scenario, the real net wage falls, and so total
labor supply falls – in a way that does depend on the elasticity of labor supply. More elastic
labor supply exacerbates labor distortion via the tax interaction effect. Our CD model has a
more elasticity labor supply than in the GH model, as discussed above, so our welfare cost per
ton of emission reduction is larger than that of GH model. Also, Figure 3 shows that carbon
pricing with lump-sum rebates is a costlier policy than a carbon tax with labor tax revenue
recycling. Finally, welfare costs increase with emissions reductions in both models.
We can also compare the CD and GH model results on other outcomes such as prices,
outputs, and labor use. Tables 5.5-5.7 in the GH book show detailed impacts of the uniform
carbon tax with either lump-sum rebates or income tax cuts on these outcomes for each of
19

The GH model also includes inflation-indexed transfers and government spending, so their tax base effect also
accounts for increases in spending necessary to hold fixed the real the production of government services.

-15their disaggregated industries. For comparison, Table 3 here show our calculated policy
impacts of both the uniform carbon tax and power-sector-only carbon tax, also with either
lump-sum rebates or labor tax recycling (at our CD model’s aggregated industry levels).
GH tables report changes in these outcomes from reference case values for years 2020
and 2035 (their carbon tax rate in 2020 is $20.8/ton and in 2035 is $37.5). Table 3 show our
calculated policy impacts at carbon tax rates of $20 and $40. In general, our Cobb-Douglas
results agree with GH’s results that producer prices rise, while all outputs and labor demand
falls. From Table 3 here and Tables 5.5-5.7 in GH, fossil-fuel output is the most affected
sector, and it falls the most in percentage terms. Labor demand in the production of 𝐹𝐹 also

falls the most in both models. The percent reduction in total labor supply is a bit larger in the
CD model, partially due to our assumption that labor is the only input to the production of
fossil fuels. Therefore the reduction in 𝐿𝐿𝐹𝐹 has more weight in determining the overall

reduction of the equilibrium quantity of labor in our model than in theirs. Another influence is
that our labor supply is more elastic than theirs. Prices received by producers fossil fuels fall
in both models, while prices paid for fossil fuels rise and so other producer prices rise.
5. Other Results
The CD model is easily used to calculate other effects of a carbon tax that are not
studied or fully reported in the book by Goulder and Hafstead (2018).
Marginal Abatement Costs
Another highly useful measure of the cost of a CO2-emission policy is its marginal
abatement cost (MAC), defined as the cost at each level of emission-reduction of eliminating
one more metric ton of CO2 emissions. Then the total cost of achieving a particular level of
abatement is the integral under the MAC curve to that point. Policymakers can compare these
costs across different policies to find the most cost-effective means of reducing emissions.
Therefore, we consider many small increases in the CO2 tax, in increments of $1/ton.
For example, consider the change from $15 to $16 per ton. As shown in previous sections, we
obtain a set of outcomes at each CO2 tax rate. The extra cost of abatement is the new welfare
cost at $16/ton minus the prior welfare cost at $15/ton, equal to $0.773 billion. The extra CO2
abated is 0.036 billion tons. Then the marginal cost of abatement (MAC) is the change in
welfare cost per unit change in CO2 abatement (0.773/0.036), equal to $22.70 per ton. The
interpretation is that it costs an extra $22.70 for a marginal metric ton of CO2 abatement.

-16Figure 4 graphs MAC curves for different carbon tax policies. It shows a carbon tax
on all sectors with lump-sum rebates (heavy dashed line) and with labor tax recycling (light
dashed line), a carbon tax in the power sector only with lump-sum rebates (heavy solid line)
and with labor tax recycling (light solid line). These MAC curves all slope upward, indicating
that costs increase with the quantity of emissions abated. For a given level of abatement, and
for either type of carbon tax, the MAC with lump-sum rebates is higher than the MAC with
labor tax recycling – because reducing the labor tax distortion reduces welfare cost.
Somewhat surprising in Figure 4 is that the MAC of the power-sector-only carbon tax
is initially less than the MAC of the uniform carbon tax. Similar results are also found in GH
for cap-and-trade policies (Figure 5.13 on page 138 of GH). 20 In the first best world with no
preexisting tax, a uniform carbon tax can never be more costly than a specific-sector tax,
because a uniform tax allows use of the lowest cost marginal abatement across sectors (as
explained in GH on page 139). With preexisting taxes, however, the MAC includes firm-level
abatement cost plus the tax interaction effect between the carbon tax policy and preexisting
taxes. Our numerical simulation results in Table 3 show that the power-sector-only carbon tax
reduces the real net wage by less than does the uniform carbon tax of the same tax rate. Thus,
the uniform carbon tax policy exacerbates the labor tax distortion more than the other policy.
At a higher level of abatement, the tax interaction advantage of the power-sector-only
carbon tax is weaker relative to its disadvantage of higher firm-level abatement cost. Thus in
Figure 4, the MAC curves for a power-sector carbon tax start below those of a uniform tax,
but rise steeply for more abatement, then cross and become higher than for a uniform tax.
Second-best optimal tax rates
In previous sections, we calculate the effects of the pollution-labor tax swap on
welfare, pollution, the wage, and labor supply. This section answers a related but different
question: given the pollution externality and labor supply distortion, what is the second best
optimal (SBO) pollution tax, and how does it compare to the first best optimal (FBO) tax?
In general, the optimal pollution tax induces the level of pollution where the marginal
social cost of pollution reduction equals the marginal social benefit of pollution reduction (the
marginal environmental damage from pollution). In the first-best case without distortionary
20

Results are similar despite multiple differences between the two models. Unlike the CD model, the GH model
incorporates adjustment costs, and it has disaggregated electricity generators differentiated by carbon intensity.
Some of the many differences between the models likely affect results in opposite directions.

-17taxes, the optimal pollution tax rate equals the marginal social damage of pollution (the
Pigouvian tax level, in Baumol and Oates, 1988, chapter 4). In the second-best case with
distortionary taxes, the optimal pollution tax can lie either below or above the marginal
environmental damage, depending on the use of additional pollution tax revenue, the marginal
cost of public fund, the magnitude of the revenue-recycling effect, the magnitude of the taxinteraction effect, and the normalization of other tax rates. 21 Our simple numerical CobbDouglas model provides an example of those prior findings.
Using the simple Cobb-Douglas model, Figure 5 plots household utility against the
CO2 tax rate for different carbon tax policies. We obtain hump-shaped curves, where utility
rises with the pollution tax rate up to some utility-maximizing tax rate and then falls with
further increases in the tax rate. It falls because the adverse distorting effect of increasing the
emission tax rate outweighs the benefit of its effect on emissions reduction. The heavy dashed
curve represents a uniform carbon tax scenario with lump-sum rebates. The light dashed curve
represents the case of a uniform carbon tax with labor tax recycling. The solid curves show
the case of a carbon tax on the power sector only.
The calculated utility-maximizing SBO tax rate in the case of a uniform carbon tax
with lump-sum tax rebates is $22/metric ton of CO2 emissions – and with labor tax recycling
it is $37/ton. These SBO tax rates for a uniform tax are below the FBO Pigouvian tax rate of
$43/ton of CO2 emissions (the SCC). In contrast, the SBO tax rates of a carbon tax on power
sector only with lump-sum rebates and labor tax recycling are $46 and $63, respectively,
which are above the FBO tax rates.
To explain these results, note that the amount of abatement is not shown in Figure 5.
The SBO uniform carbon tax rates are lower than the power-sector carbon tax rates, because
each dollar per ton can achieve more abatement. Also, for each dollar per ton, the uniform
carbon tax has a bigger tax interaction effect than the power-sector-only carbon tax. Our
numerical results in Table 3 show that each dollar per ton of uniform tax reduces the real net
wage much more than does the carbon tax just on the power sector. But, with labor tax
recycling, the revenue recycling effect offsets the tax interaction effect, and thus the SBO tax
rates in the case with labor tax recycling are always higher than with lump-sum rebates.

Goulder (1996), and Fullerton (1997).

-18Leakage
A concern with any pollution restriction on one sector is that it might cause “leakage”,
an increase in emissions in other sectors that offset part of the reduction in pollution-restricted
sectors. Goulder and Hafstead do not report leakage results when they discuss the carbon tax
(on p.136). They do discuss leakage results for a cap-and-trade program in the power sector
only (on p.140). They find leakage of 1.2% to 1.7%, but that page does not report the permit
price. In our numerical example, we consider a carbon tax on the power sector only. With
lump-sum rebates, we calculate a leakage rate of 3.9%, meaning that additional emissions in
other sectors offset 3.9% of emission reductions in the power sector. With labor tax recycling,
the leakage rate is 6%, which is one and a half times the leakage with lump-sum rebates. 22
Accuracy of calculated leakage in the CD model is probably limited because of its high level
of aggregation and the absence of a foreign sector. The point of the CD model is not accuracy,
however, but understanding the nature of results from large CGE models.
6. Discussion and Conclusions
For any proposed policy, political leaders are most often concerned about actual
effects on jobs, outputs of each industry, changes in trade deficits, and overall GDP. They
have little inclination to discuss conceptual issues in environmental policy analysis, or even to
sort out the cause-and-effect relationships. They therefore need the best possible numerical
results from the most recent and most detailed computable general equilibrium model
available. As of 2018, one of the best and most recent CGE models for climate policy is
described in the book by Goulder and Hafstead. It is indeed a monumental achievement. And
such models can only be produced by the best-trained academics who do understand the
conceptual issues and all the cause-and-effect relationships.
For political leaders, our paper does not produce the best possible numbers for the
effects of a carbon tax on outputs, GDP, or even emissions. For academics, however, our
paper does indeed provide some interesting results. It shows very directly, and in simple
terms, exactly what are the key ingredients of a CGE model that does generate detailed
22

We are unable to decompose total leakage into various channels, as in Baylis et al. (2014). Their paper finds
that a pollution limitation on one sector can lead to “negative leakage”, emissions reductions in the other sector
under certain conditions. They show that negative leakage is more likely if the elasticity of substitution in the
production of electricity is greater than the elasticity of substitution in utility. In our CD model, all elasticities of
substitution are unity, which explains why we are unlikely to see a net negative leakage in our CD model.

-19numerical results. In particular, with just three industries and without the input-output matrix
of the GH model, we obtain very similar results on aggregated outcomes such as economywide emissions, the welfare cost of carbon taxes, and total labor supply. These results are not
much affected by the sheer number of industries (35 in GH) or the many interactions between
them. 23 The main intuitions about climate policy also need not depend on having a dynamic
model such as in GH, with capital investments, taxes on capital, or even changes in growth.
Our model has none of those, nor international trade.
A key force is the assumed elasticities in production and consumption. More elastic
behavior in production or in consumption means that a carbon tax has a larger impact on
carbon emissions, output, and welfare. Our Cobb-Douglas model makes solutions for
outcomes very simple, but the elasticities all equal to 1.0 are not that different from the
elasticities in GH (between 0.5 and 1.0). Also relevant, of course, is carbon-intensity of
production, factor shares, and the shares of total expenditure on each carbon-intensive
product. We borrow these data directly from GH. A third key feature is whether the carbon
tax applies to all carbon in the economy or just to carbon use in one sector. A fourth influence
on the effect of carbon policy is the pre-existence of distorting taxes and the use of carbon
revenue. When our CD model is built to replicate the large GH model in all these key
elements, we show that results are very close to those of the large complicated CGE model.
Our numerical CD model also provides a clean illustration of many concepts and
analytical findings in the prior literature on optimal carbon policy and on the impacts of a
carbon tax. Our simple CD model has labor tax as the only pre-existing distortionary tax, for
example, so the CD model allows us to study and compare magnitudes of the tax interaction
effect between different carbon tax policies and the pre-existing labor tax in a very transparent
fashion. As in the analytical chapter and the later simulation chapters of the GH book, we
show that the tax interaction effect raises the cost of the carbon tax policy, and its magnitude
increases with the carbon tax rate. Revenue recycling effects work in the opposite direction
and reduce the cost of the carbon tax policy. Magnitudes of these tax interaction effects and
revenue recycling effects help determine second-best optimal carbon tax rates.
In conclusion, our simple Cobb-Douglas model shows readers how to solve a CGE

23
With no short-run rigidity in the CD model, our results might approximate the medium-run results in the GH
model. Their short-run results differ because of adjustment costs, and their long-run results differ because of
growth. Also, as discussed, our results with identical households cannot match their distributional results.

-20model using a paper and pencil on the “back of an envelope.” Thus, it is a useful tool for
teaching general equilibrium to graduate students or for those who have no experience
building or solving a CGE model. Also, by comparing numerical results from a simple static
general equilibrium CD model to those from a dynamic CGE model, we show how a wellconstructed simple CD model can yield several results that match with those from a largescale CGE model. An advantage of a Cobb-Douglas model is that results are easier to
understand using exact analytical solutions for each price, output, welfare loss, and the utilitymaximizing pollution tax rate. Therefore, our paper is not just a teaching tool for a graduate
economics, class, but it can also be used by new researchers as an entrée to building their own
CGE model and by other seasoned researchers to understand CGE results.

uniform carbon tax implies a known 𝜏𝜏𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶
= 𝜏𝜏𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶
= 𝜏𝜏𝐶𝐶′ > 0. We assume no change in labor tax

(𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿′ = 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿𝑜𝑜 ). We use (2.8) and (2.10) to get an equation with only one unknown variable, 𝑅𝑅′:
𝐺𝐺𝐿𝐿� �1 −

(1 + 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿′ )(1 − 𝑎𝑎 − 𝑏𝑏 − 𝑐𝑐) + 𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽 + 𝜖𝜖(𝑏𝑏 + 𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾)

� − 𝑅𝑅′)(1 + 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿′ ), and obtain:
To solve for 𝑅𝑅′, first shorten that expression using 𝑑𝑑 ≡ (𝐼𝐼 − 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾′ 𝐾𝐾

We solve this quadratic equation to get 𝑑𝑑 and then 𝑅𝑅 ′ .

Then substitute 𝑅𝑅′ into (2.4) to get 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿′ , into (2.9) to get 𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹′ , and into (2.5), (2.6), and

(2.8) to get labor used for each sector. Use equation (1.14), (1.17), and (1.18) to get fossil

fuels and thus carbon emissions in each sector. We use the production function for 𝐸𝐸 to get
output 𝐸𝐸 and price 𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 , and then find 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 , 𝐸𝐸𝐻𝐻 , 𝑋𝑋, and 𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 .
Uniform carbon tax with labor-tax recycling

In the case with labor tax recycling and no change in rebate (𝑅𝑅 ′ = 𝑅𝑅 𝑜𝑜 ), we use (2.8)

and (2.10) to get an equation with 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿′ as the only unknown variable:
𝐺𝐺 �𝐿𝐿�−𝐿𝐿′𝐻𝐻 −

(A.2)

Through algebraic derivations, we solve this quadratic equation for 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿′ using (A.2) to get:

𝑅𝑅 ′

Then substitute 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿′ into (2.9) to get 𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹′ , and into (2.5), (2.6), and (2.8) to get labor used

in each sector. Use equation (1.14), (1.17), and (1.18) to get fossil fuels and carbon emissions

-29in each sector. We use the production function for 𝐸𝐸 to get output 𝐸𝐸 and price 𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 , and then

find 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 , 𝐸𝐸𝐻𝐻 , 𝑋𝑋, and 𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 .

The power-sector-only carbon tax implies a known 𝜏𝜏𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶

Appendix B. Calibration
We define our electricity sector 𝐸𝐸 to include four GH industries: electric transmission

and distribution, coal-fired electricity generation, other-fossil electricity generation, and nonfossil electricity generation. We aggregate seven industries of GH into our fossil fuel

production sector 𝐹𝐹, including coal mining, oil and gas extraction, mining support activities,
natural gas distribution, petroleum refining, and pipeline transportation. All other private
sector industries are aggregated into 𝑋𝑋, our composite good sector.

Panel A of Table 1 shows data for inputs and outputs in the production and household

sectors (both dollar values and quantities). We employ the “unit convention,” which defines a
unit of each good or primary factor as the amount such that its net-of-tax cost is one dollar in
the initial equilibrium: 𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋𝑜𝑜 = 𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸𝑜𝑜 = 𝑃𝑃𝐹𝐹𝑜𝑜 = 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾𝑜𝑜 = 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿𝑜𝑜 =1. No tax is imposed on capital 𝐾𝐾 or on

goods 𝑋𝑋, 𝐸𝐸, and 𝐹𝐹. Thus, we infer the initial quantity of each such good from its production
value, and the quantity of capital 𝐾𝐾 from the sum of its values in production of all outputs.

Because of the unit convention (𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿𝑜𝑜 =1), labor supply equals total labor compensation divided

by (1+𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿 ). Then, using data in Panel A of Table 1, we calculate and show share parameters in

production and household sectors in Panel B of the same table.

-31We consider the choice between labor and leisure, using the GH assumption that
workers spend 66% of their time at work (e.g., 40 hour week of 60 hours maximum). 1 We
aggregate their various labor income taxes into a single rate. Their calculated labor income tax
rate is 26.70%, employer payroll tax rate is 6.23%, and employee payroll tax rate is 6.95%.
Thus, our single labor tax rate is 60.24% of the net wage. 2 Total labor compensation is
$6,890.8 billion, so 𝐿𝐿=6,890.8 billion. Then we calculate the dollar value of non-market time
(leisure at home) as 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿𝑜𝑜 𝐿𝐿𝑜𝑜𝐻𝐻 = (34/66)×6,890.80/(1.6024)=B$2,215.29, so the quantity of non-

market labor is 𝐿𝐿𝑜𝑜𝐻𝐻 =2,215.29. Fixed nominal “full” income 𝐼𝐼 is the sum of this value of leisure

plus gross domestic product in the private sector from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis
(BEA). 3 We also take household spending on electricity and fossil fuels directly from GH,

and then our spending on the composite good 𝑋𝑋 is the income left after paying for electricity,

fossil fuels, and non-market time. By the unit convention, these dollar value expenditures are
also quantities (see Household Sector column of Panel A of Table 1).

We also calculate quantities and dollar values of electricity and fossil fuel used in each
sector. First, based on our aggregation and the GH data, we calculate the total dollar value of
the electricity sector, and 𝐸𝐸 𝑜𝑜 = B546.70. Electricity is used either at home or in sector 𝑋𝑋 in

our model, so the dollar value of electricity input in the production of 𝑋𝑋 is just the dollar value
of total electricity, 𝐸𝐸, minus the dollar value of electricity used at home, 𝐸𝐸𝐻𝐻 . These numbers

all appear in Panel A of Table 1. Next, we need dollar values of fossil fuels used in sectors 𝐸𝐸
and 𝑋𝑋, which are not readily available from GH, so we use household expenditures on fossil
fuels and reported sectoral shares of fossil-fuel use from the U.S. Energy Information

Administration (EIA). 4 By our calculation for 2013, the residential sector uses about 12.52%

of total fossil fuels, the electricity sector uses 35.80%, and all other sectors use 51.67%. Thus,
𝐹𝐹𝐸𝐸 is about three times the fossil fuels used at home, 𝐹𝐹𝐻𝐻 (and 𝐹𝐹𝑋𝑋 is about four times 𝐹𝐹𝐻𝐻 ). Total

fossil fuel used in the economy is the sum of fossil fuel use in all sectors.

The relevance and impact of this assumption is demonstrated in Ballard (1999).

Suppose 𝑤𝑤 is the wage actually paid, so the gross-of-all-tax wage paid for each unit of labor is 𝑤𝑤×(1+0.0623).
The net-of-all-tax wage is 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿 = 𝑤𝑤×(1–0.0695–0.267). Thus, our single labor tax rate as a fraction of the net wage
is: 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿𝑜𝑜 = (1+0.0623)/(1–0.0695–0.267) –1 = 0.6024. This labor tax rate is 60.24% of the net wage, equivalent to a
tax rate of 0.6024/(1.6024) = 37.59% of the gross wage.

We choose the BEA’s 2013 data to be consistent with input-output data from GH.

-32Next, we find labor and capital used in each sector. Capital input data are not reported
in GH, and our production functions do not include all GH inputs (capital, labor, energy, and
materials). Therefore, we supplement GH data with Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)
data. The production of electricity in our model uses only three inputs: capital 𝐾𝐾𝐸𝐸 , labor 𝐿𝐿𝐸𝐸 ,

and fossil fuels 𝐹𝐹𝐸𝐸 . Thus, this sector’s total payment to labor and capital must equal the value
of electricity minus the cost of fossil fuels calculated above. BEA data are used only to

calculate the ratio of labor to capital payments for our aggregated electricity sector (which is
about one-third). 5 This ratio is then used to separate payments to labor and capital.
As labor is the only input to production of 𝐹𝐹, the payment to labor in 𝐹𝐹 is the value

of 𝐹𝐹 calculated above. The payment to labor used in 𝑋𝑋 is total labor compensation minus

labor compensation paid in 𝐸𝐸 and 𝐹𝐹. Total payment to capital in 𝑋𝑋 is the dollar value of 𝑋𝑋

minus the above-calculated costs of electricity, fossil fuel, and labor inputs. Using our unit
convention and the initial labor tax rate, we get quantities of labor and capital used in each
sector, as shown in the first two columns of panel A in Table 1.
Next, we use output value for each sector to calculate the household expenditure share

for each consumption good, and we use input values in each sector to calculate production
cost shares. In the Cobb-Douglas model, those shares are also parameters in utility and
production functions. Also, we calculate the TFP parameters in Cobb-Douglas production
functions using benchmark equilibrium quantities of outputs and inputs. 6
To analyze welfare impacts of the pollution tax, we follow GH by using $43 per
metric ton of CO2 as the social cost of carbon (SCC). We take this SCC (in dollars per ton)
times the marginal utility of income (in utils per dollar) to get the marginal utility cost of
emissions (in utils per ton). This marginal disutility is assumed to be a constant parameter 𝜃𝜃 in
household welfare (𝑊𝑊 = 𝑈𝑈 − 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃). In the Cobb-Douglas case, with homothetic utility, the
marginal utility of income equals the ratio of total utility from consumption of goods and
leisure to the full income (𝑈𝑈/𝐼𝐼). This calculation yields 𝜃𝜃=26.72 (utils per ton).

Finally, to calculate the emission conversion parameter 𝜌𝜌, divide total CO2 emissions

(5.360 billion metric tons as in GH) by total fossil fuels 𝐹𝐹 (621.188 billion). Thus, 𝜌𝜌=0.00863.
The BEA data on composition of output by industry only allow us to calculate the labor-capital compensation
ratio for “Utilities,” which include our aggregated electricity industry plus natural gas distribution and water
utilities. However, output from the electricity industry is the major part of all utilities.
