ISSUES AND RESULTS FORM RESEARCH ON THE ELDERLY I: ECONOMIC STATUS
(PART I OF III PARTS)

ABSTRACT

This is the first part of a three-part paper on research on the elderly.
The objective of the paper is to present issues and research results in three

areas: economic status, retirement, and consumption and

saving. This part

covers background material on demographic change, living arrangements, income

growth and labor force participation, and research on economic Status.
The major areas of research on economic status are: adjustments to
observed income to bring it closer to a welfare measure with the objective of
understanding whether the elderly are better off than the nonelderly; the

distribution of income among the elderly and in particular the extent and causes

of the high poverty level of elderly widows; wealth

holdings, especially

sources of wealth and the importance of public programs.

1. Introduction

Research by economists on the elderly has grown rapidly since the 1978

review on the economics of aging in this Journal (Robert Clark, Juanita Kreps

and Joseph Spengler, 1978). An important reason for this growth is demographic
change. In 1900 just 4% of the population was elderly (65 or older). By 1980
the elderly were 11% of the population and they are projected to rise to 22% in

2040. Although each age group has its own productive capacities and demands,
the capacities and demands of the elderly are very different from the rest of
the population, so the large demographic changes will have a substantial impact

on society. For example, because few elderly work, their consumption must be
financed either through their own savings or through social programs: The
demographic changes are bound to put stress on capital markets and social

institutions. Each age group faces uncertainty, but the consequences of
uncertainty for the elderly are probably larger than for other age groups simply
because they have fewer remaining years over which to spread windfall gains or

losses. Furthermore, they have fewer responses to unexpected events. For
example, many retired elderly cannot return to the work force in response to an
unanticipated drop in income.

A second reason for the increase in research on the elderly has been the
availability of data that can be used to study and test some basic economic

models. Retirement is an aspect of labor supply. The Social Security system
and pensions offer economic incentives that are different from the labor market
incentives offered earlier in life. The response of workers of retirement age
can provide information about the tradeoff between goods and leisure which can
complement knowledge gained from studying the labor supply of younger workers.
The study of the consumption behavior of workers has been difficult because

their main asset, human capital, is not observed. The main assets of the

1

retired elderly (financial assets, housing and claims on retirement programs).

however, are observed. Study is further simplified because the utility of
retired individuals only depends on consumption, whereas the utility of workers

depends on consumption and leisure. Therefore, only the intertemporal aspects
of utility maximization need to be considered, not the intratemporal aspects.
In life cycle models, consumption depends on the interest rate and on mortality

rates, as well as on assets. But variation in interest rates across individuals
is typically not observed, and, among younger people, variation in mortality
rates from person to person is so small that any effect is absorbed

in the

constant parameters of a consumption model. The mortality rates of the elderly
are substantial, and they vary considerably by age and by sex.

The variation

can econometrically identify important utility function parameters.
The demographic changes and the research questions would have attracted
much less attention, however, had it not been for the Retirement History Survey
(RHS). THE LUIS is a ten-year longitudinal survey of 11,153 households whose
if

heads who were 58-63 in 1969. Every two years the heads (or their spouses

the head had died) were questioned about income, assets, employment, health, and

social and family interactions. Most importantly, the official Social Security
earnings records were attached to the survey data. From them,

each person's

Social Security eligibility and benefits can be calculated exactly. In
principle, this provides the necessary data to estimate the effects of Social

Security on retirement. The earnings records can also be used to

form a good

estimate of lifetime earnings, which is almost necessary in any study of
lifetime wealth accumulation. The RHS has proven to be an invaluable resource:
many results to be discussed in this paper are derived from the RES data.
The main goal of this paper is to present and analyze some major research

questions and findings. The research falls in three main areas:

economic

status of the elderly, retirement, and consumption and saving behavior.

2

Health,

which is properly the subject of an entire paper, and social and family
relationships are only mentioned in connection with the topics covered.

Because the analysis will often refer to recent economic and demographic
changes, the next section will use widely available data on

population, life

epeetancy, living arrangements, labor force participation, and income to
provide background for the discussion of the research.

2.

Demographic and Economic Changes.

Between 1900 and 1980 the proportion of the population that was elderly

increased from 4% to 11% (Table 1). The proportion 85 and over increased from a
fraction of a percent to 1%, which is about 2 million people. Population
forecasts, which should be quite accurate over the next 30 years, show large
increases in the fraction of the population that is old.

By 2050, 6% (16

million people) of the population will be 85 or over; about eight million

people will be 90 or over. Thus between 1980 and 2050 the number aged 85 and
over is expected to increase by a factor of eight.
Part of the change in the age distribution is due to a long-term fall in
birth rates, which, by itself, would have gradually increased the average age.
Part of the large projected increase in the elderly is due to the baby-boom

cohort (1946 to 1964). The fattest part of this bulge in the population will be
65 in 2020 and 95 in 2050. Mortality rates have fallen sharply, contributing to
the change in age distribution: in 1900 life expectancy at birth of males and
females was 46 and 49 years respectively; in 1980 it was 70 and 78.
Life expectancy, conditional on reaching 65, is forecast to continue to

increase (Table 2). If there is no change in the average retirement age, the
fraction of life spent in retirement will increase. Financing more consumption
from a shorter worklife will strain the savings of each retired person. The

3

problem for society is greater because the probability that an individual will
reach 65 will continue to increase and the number of individuals in the cohorts

approaching 65 will rise. Therefore, the fraction of output consumed by the
retired will increase substantially. This will affect not only Social Security
and private pensions but capital markets as the retired convert their savings
into

consumption.
At the turn of the century, the conditional life expectancies of men and

women were practically the same. By 1980 a 65 year-old woman could expect to
live 4.2 years more than a 65 year-old man. The difference is forecast to
continue to increase slowly. Beyond the more obvious impacts on Social Security
and pensions, the differences in life expectancy mean that most of the very old

are widows. Because the very old must finance a long lifetime of consumption,
it is likely that they will have few assets toward the end of their lives.

Therefore, in the absence of social programs, the longer lifetimes of women will

lead to high rates of poverty among widows. As will be discussed below, elderly
widows have substantially higher poverty rates than others; the population
forecasts give no suggestion that demographic changes by themselves will reduce
the rates.

Higher mortality rates of men affect the living arrangements of the

elderly. In 1985, 53% of the elderly lived with a spouse, but the distribution
was very different for men and women: 75% of elderly men lived with their wives
while only 38% of elderly women lived with their husbands (Table 3)1
Differences in living arrangements by age were much smaller among men than among

women because most wives outlive their husbands. For example, 49% of women aged
65-74 lived with their spouses compared with 23% of women aged 75+. Most of the
women not living with spouses would be widows. Of that group about two-thirds
lived alone.

Comparisons over time show a small increase in the fraction of

elderly men living with a spouse (probably due to the increase in the life

4

expectancy of women), and a modest increase in the fraction living alone.

Among

women the changes were much greater: 24% lived alone 1960, 41% in 1985. The
fraction living with relatives fell from 34% to 18%. The largest changes were
among women 75 and over: during the 25 years the fraction living alone almost
doubled from 26% to 50%; the fraction living with relatives fell from 46% to
25%. The trend from living with relatives to living alone was due, at least
partly, to rising economic resources (Robert Michael, Victor Fuchs and Sharon

Scott, 1980; Karen Holden, 1986; Saul Schwartz, Sheldon Danziger and Eugene
Smolensky, 1984). If incomes are stable in the future, a continuing increase in
the difference in life expectancies, as forecast in Table 3, implies that about
half of elderly women will live alone.
The average real income of the elderly, as conventionally measured in the
Current Population Survey, increased by about 29% between 1970 and 1986 (Table

4), with more than half of the increase coming between 1970 and 1975. The mean
income of the entire population increased by only 8.5%, so that the income of

the the elderly relative to the entire population rose from 0.54 to 0.64. As
will be discussed below, this income measure is far from what economists would
call a full income measure, and it makes no provision for differences in

household size. Nonetheless, the figures give a good indication of the relative
income gain of the elderly.

The income growth of the elderly was accompanied by rather large changes in

the source of income as shown in Table 5. Income from earnings fell from 29% of
total income in 1967 to 17% in 1986. The fraction of income from Social
Security and pensions increased from 49% to 54%, mostly due to increases in

Social Security. Income from assets increased substantially but, as to be
discussed below, assets are so highly concentrated that the change was not
important for many of the elderly
Table 6 gives the distribution of elderly households according to the

5

fraction of each household's income from various sources. For example, in 1971,
69% of elderly households had no earnings, 16% had from 1% to 49% of their
income from earnings, and 15% had 50% to 100% of their income from earnings.

The table shows that by 1986, 81% of elderly households had no income from
earnings, and that just 8% had more than half of their income from earnings.@2
The percentage of households having no income from Social Security dropped

from 13% in 1971 to 8% in 1986. This change is partly due to increasing

coverage of Social Security. It is also due to earlier retirement: under the
Social Security law, few full-time workers would receive Social Security
benefits, so as participation rates fell, the fraction receiving Social Security

benefits rose. The importance of Social Security to most elderly can hardly be
overstated: in 1986 57% had more than half of their income from Social
Security, and 24% had more than 90%.

Although the fraction of the elderly with income from public and private
pensions and annuities (almost all pensions) has increased, pensions are still a

modest source of income. In 1986, only 26% had private pension income; about
13% had government pensions. These figures imply that, at most, 39% of
households had some pension income. Even among those with pension income, few
households had a large fraction of their income from pensions: just 7% of
households had more than 50% of their income from either private or public

pensions. Again, 57% of households had more than half of their income from
Social Security.

Table 6 confirms that asset income (which does not include any imputed

income to housing equity) has become more important; yet, in 1986 40% of
households had no income from assets, and 70% of households had less than 20% of

their income from assets. These figures accord with findings to be reported
later that many households retire with practically no financial savings.

Although asset income was 26% of total income (Table 5), most households had

6

small amounts from assets, reflecting the highly skewed distribution of wealth.
The decrease in the importance of earnings is reflected in changes in labor
force participation, which for the elderly, is practically synonymous with

retirement. The changes in participation are large: between 1950 and 1987 the
participation rate of elderly men fell from 46% to 16%. In comparison, the
participation rate of the population increase from 60% to 66%, due to increased

participation by women. The fall in participation has been greatest at the most
advanced ages, but even at younger ages it has been substantial (Table 7). For
example, the participation rate of men 55-59 fell between 1957 and 1987 from
91.4% to 79.7%.

The normal retirement age of men, which at one time was 65 or even older,

is now less than 65 Many men retire in their late 50's. Among women two
opposite trends, earlier retirement and higher lifetime participation rates,

have kept the participation rates of 60-64 and 65-69 years olds approximately

constant. A way to isolate the trend to earlier retirement is to calculate the

retirement hazard rate, which is the probability of retirement at age T given
labor force participation at age T-l. A rough calculation of the retirement
hazard rate can be made from the participation rates of Table 7 by assuming that
the cross-section participation probabilities are the same as the participation
probabilities as an individual ages.

According to this method of calculation, in 1957 the probability of retiring at
ages 60-64 given labor force participation at ages 55-59 was 0.093 for men and

0.207 for women. Thus, even among the small number of women

who were in the

labor force later in life the retirement probabilities were higher than the

retirement probabilities of men. The retirement hazards of men increased more
so that by 1987 the hazards of men and women were about the same.
The data discussed in this section show large changes in the demographic
structure of the population, and in the income, labor force participation, and

living arrangements of the elderly. Some of the research to be reviewed in the
rest of the paper will aim at understanding the consequences of these changes,
and some will aim at learning the causes of the changes.

3. Economic Status

The broad goals of the research on economic status have been to find better
measures of economic well-being than simple income statistics,

and to use the

measures to determine whether the economic status of the elderly has improved
over time, whether it has improved faster than the

economic status of the

nonelderly, and whether it is higher than the economic status of the nonelderly.
The ultimate social usefulness of the work is to assess whether the system of

transfers from the nonelderly to the elderly is adequate. Broadly speaking,

work has immediate policy implications. For example, it
decide how much of the rising Medicare and Medicaid costs

the

could be used to help
should be borne by the

elderly and how much by the nonelderly.
Some of the research is concerned with measurement:
flows from nonmoney sources such as housing, and Medicare

8

how to impute income

and Medicaid, and how

to adjust for taxes and underreporting of income. Other research aims to find
welfare measures from income: how to adjust for family size and composition to
account for need. Considerable work has been aimed at distributional aspects of
income, in particular, at poverty. Some work has been done on wealth measures
of well being, but limitations of data and comparability with the nonelderly
limit its application.3

3.1 Trends in Income

No single study has an income series with all the household size
adjustments and adjustments to income that are desired. Therefore, I first give
results that are based on the consistent application of one particular size

adjustment. The similarity of method over years should increase our confidence
in the observed trends. Then, I give results for a single year that incorporate
all the adjustments. Provided there is stability of the effects of the
adjustments, the two approaches taken together should give a good idea of the
fully adjusted trends.
Table 8 shows annual growth rates in income and the level of income in 1984
adjusted for household size according to the official poverty index.4 In this
scaling, one nonelderly person has a weight of 1.024, two nonelderly persons
1.322, three persons (either elderly or nonelderly) 1.568 and so forth.5
Elderly persons are given slightly smaller weights (about 8% smaller than the

nonelderly). Size-adjusted income (income per equivalent person) is household
income divided by the household weight. The scaling embodies the assumption of
substantial returns to scale in household consumption: a two-person nonelderly
household requires only 29% more income than a one-person household. This
scaling yields income measures that are closer to income per household than to

income per person: income per household has an implicit weight of 1.0 for all

9

households whereas income per person is based on assigning a weight of 1.0 to
each person.

The average elderly family unit is smaller than the average nonelderly
family unit (1.7 persons per household versus 3.0 persons

in 1980), so the size

adjustments will raise the income measure of the elderly relative to the

nonelderly. In Table 8 the ratio of incomes of the nonelderly to

the elderly

was 0.67 in 1984 with no size adjustment; the ratio was 0.87 with the size
adjustment. Average family size has decreased over time, but it has decreased
more for the nonelderly than for the elderly. Therefore, the size adjustment
will produce a larger increase in income per equivalent person of the nonelderly

than of the elderly. For example, the size adjustment increased

the annual rate

of growth of income between 1979 and 1984 by 0.9% for the nonelderly but by just
0.3% for the elderly.

By either the unadjusted or adjusted income measure the elderly had much
higher rates of growth of income than the nonelderly.

These differences

cumulate over a number of years to give quite different income changes.

For

example the total income changes from 1967 to 1984 are

Source: Table 8

The growth of income of the nonelderly has come from increased work effort,6
whereas earnings of the elderly have fallen as their labor force participation
rates declined.

Table 8 shows that, after adjusting for size, in most cases income growth

10

increased with age. This is partly due to the aging of younger, more wealthy

cohorts and partly due to increases in Social Security, which are relatively

more important to the very old. Still, as measured in Table 8, by 1984 the
incomes of the most elderly were still lower than the incomes of any age group.
Table 9 indicates that incomes of the elderly increased throughout the

income distribution.7 In the second decile their incomes grew rapidly during
the first time period, possibly due to large across-the-board increases in

Social Security benefits. They continued to grow in the second time period,

although at a slower rate. Total growth over both periods was about 84%. The
nonelderly in the second decile had much less growth during the first period,

and their incomes fell substantially during the second period. The difference
in the experience of the nonelderly and the elderly is clearly shown by the

sharp break in growth rates at ages 60-64. Total income growth of the
nonelderly over both periods was very close to zero.
The elderly in the ninth decile had consistent income growth, but overall

(1967-1984) it was less than the elderly in the second decile: 49% compared

with 84%. The nonelderly in the ninth percentile also had income growth over
both periods, and, although there were some differences in each period, total
growth was not much different from the income growth of the elderly in the ninth

decile. It was much different, however, from the income growth of the
nonelderly in the second decile.

The general impression from the table is that the poorer elderly have done
much better than the poorer nonelderly, especially between 1979 and 1984.
Incomes of the well-to-do elderly have increased sharply in recent years,

probably due to the increase in asset income noted in Tables 5 and 6. Between
1969 and 1984 income inequality among the nonelderly seems to have increased,

particularly from 1979 to 1984. From 1969 to 1984 income inequality among the
elderly probably decreased, but not from 1979 to 1984.

11

The income growth in Tables 8 and 9 include cohort effects: changes within
an age group are not those of any individual or group.

The following table

roughly eliminates cohort effects by giving the income (1982$) of the cohort
born in 1898-1903.

In 1967, when this cohort was 65-69 years old, its mean real income was

$11,095; in 1979, when it was 75-79 years old, its mean real income was

$10,847. Some may find the stability of income surprising in view of the high
rates of inflation during the 1970's. At one time it was generally thought that
the elderly live on fixed incomes and are vulnerable to inflation; but

these

figures suggest the income of the elderly is effectively indexed.
The stability between 1967 and 1979 is not a reliable indicator of income

indexing because of two countervailing changes: earnings would have dropped
because of the trend toward earlier retirement; Social Security benefits would
have increased due to changes in the benefit schedule in the early part of the
1970's. However, the stability between 1979 and 1984, when the CPI increased by
43%, certainly indicates effective indexing.8

Just why income should be

effectively indexed is not apparent from the distribution of income by source
shown in Table 5. At least part of pension income and part of asset income are

not indexed, so thattotal income is not completely indexed. Detailed study of
income in the RRS, however, confirms that incomes of individuals were stable

12

during the l970s, a period of high and variable inflation (Burkhauser, Holden
and Feaster, 1988).

Apparently the unindexed parts of income were small and

concentrated among a few individuals.

A different method of finding inflation vulnerability is based on how the
value of assets (including the present value of income flows such as Social
Security) is expected to change when inflation changes (Hurd and Shoven, 1985).
For example, long-term nominal bonds are vulnerable to changes in the inflation

rate whereas housing wealth is not. According to this measure of inflation
vulnerability, very few of the elderly would be affected substantially by a

change in inflation. This implies that the real value of the income flows from
the assets will not change with changes in inflation, which is consistent with
the effective indexing of income in the table.

3.2. Income comparisons.
-

The aim of the research on income comparisons is to understand better the
economic status of the elderly compared with the nonelderly. Its method is to
bring income measures closer to welfare measures by adjusting income for
nonmoney components, underreporting and taxes, and by scaling for family size.
Table 10 shows the ratio of average income of the elderly to the nonelderlyfor several different income measures and for several size adjustments.

Conventional income is the usual income measure from the Current Population

Surveys; according to conventional income elderly households had just 52% of
the income of nonelderly households in 1971. Line B shows income adjusted for
the value of in-kind transfers, implicit income from housing, employment-related

benefits and direct taxes. These changes are important. In-kind transfers
increased the incomes of the elderly by $1430 per household, $1344 of which is
the market value of the transfers they receive on average through the Medicare

13

and Medicaid programs. The elderly have lower tax rates than the nonelderly,
even holding income constant. They hold more housing equity.

The effect of all

these adjustments is to increase incomes of the elderly by about 12%. The most
important changes for the nonelderly are taxes, and work-related benefits.

These changes decrease average income by 10%. As a result, as

shown in line B,

the ratio of household incomes increases to 0.65.

Adjusted income in Table 10 differs from income in two ways.

The most

important difference is due to underreporting of income: according to a
validation study of survey data, the nonelderly underreport on average by about
3%, but the elderly underreport by about 37%, mainly property income (Radner,

1983). This adjustment, which is done for each income source at the household
level, substantially increases the income ratios. The other adjustment changes
the method of valuing the noninoney transfers in line B: they are

valued at an

estimate of what the recipient would be willing to pay for them (recipient
value) ,

rather

than at the cost to the provider (market value). The recipient

value is less than the market value especially for the poor. This adjustment
lowers the income ratio due to the large transfers through the Medicare/Medicaid
system, but the change is minor compared with the change for income
underreporting.

The table has three different adjustments to household income for household

size and composition. The aim is to bring household income closer to an
individual welfare measure by dividing income by a suitable index. The index
used in calculating per capita income is, of course, just the number of people

in the household. It embodies the assumption that there are no returns to scale
in household consumption. The poverty line index is based on the poverty scale;
it was used in the size adjustments in Table 8. It implies substantial returns
to scale: according to this index, if a single elderly male has a consumption
weight of 1.0, a husband and wife have a consumption weight

14

of 1.26. That is,

the couple would be deemed to be as well off as the single male if their income

was 26% greater. The budget share index was estimated from observed variation
in consumption patterns as family composition varied in the 1972-73 Consumer

Expenditure Survey (van der Caag and Smolensky, 1982). At least conceptually
this is the best of the indices of household size. Compared with the poverty
scale it has more modest returns to scale in consumption: according to this
index an elderly husband and wife need about 37% more income than a single male.
In my view line B is a better income-based measure of welfare because it is

more inclusive. In principle, adjusted income is superior to income, although
the adjustment for underreporting only makes sense on average: the
underreporting is mainly associated with property income which is highly

concentrated. As a rough welfare measure, household income is too high, as it

implies it is costless to add additional individuals to a household. Per capita
income is too low because it bars any returns to scale. The poverty line index
is not based on any observed behavior or theoretical model. That leaves the
budget share measure. The income and adjusted-income ratios are 1.04 and 1.28
respectively, implying that in 1979 the elderly were at least as well off on
average as the nonelderly, and possibly better off.
The results in Table 10, which are based on detailed analysis of 1979 CPS

data, can be updated by applying the observed growth in CPS income. According
to the Cl'S, the ratio of mean incomes of the elderly to the nonelderly increased

by 12.3% between 1979 and 1986. If all the components and adjustments to income
of Table 10 grew at the same relative rate, the income ratio would grow from
1.04 to 1.17 and the adjusted-income ratio from 1.28 to 1.44.
Most researcher would agree, I believe, that on average the elderly are at
least as well off as the nonelderly as measured by income,10 but, as the entries
in Table 10 suggest, the magnitude of the differential is not precisely

measured. From the point of view of public policy, however, precision is not

15

required: if the elderly are as well off as the nonelderly, there
reason for new policy that would transfer income to them. Policy

is little
should

concentrate on the distribution of income among the elderly.

3.3. Distribution of Income.

Even though Social Security is an important source of income and it acts
strongly to reduce income inequality through the progressivity of the schedule
from lifetime earnings to benefits, income of the elderly appears to be more

unequally distributed than income of the nonelderly. Table 11 has Gini
coefficients of income and the percentage of income to the highest income

quintile. Although there is some variation by year, data set and income
measure, both inequality measures show more income inequality among the elderly

than among the nonelderly. The results from the 1973 Consumer Expenditure
Survey and the 1979 CPS (unadjusted) are based on the same income measure and

they yield about the same Gini coefficients. The adjustments to income in the
1979 CPS reduce income inequality because the well-to-do have higher tax rates
and the poor receive a larger fraction of their budgets from nonmoney transfers.

The differences between the unadjusted and adjusted inequality measures are
greatest among the elderly because of the importance of Medicare and Medicaid.
The last three lines are based on consistent methods of measuring income in the

CPS: they embody the poverty scale size adjustment for household size discussed
earlier. They verify increasing inequality from 1979 to 1984 especially among
the nonelderly, as was found in Table 9.

Income levels, sources of income and the changes in income by source are

very different for the highest and lowest quintiles. Table 12

shows that the

lowest quintile had about 8% of the income of the highest quintile in 1967;

about 13% in 1979 and 12% in 1984.11 Earnings in the lowest quintile were

16

negligible. For this group, Social Security benefits were the only important
source of income, and benefit increases were the main reason for increasing

income: of the $1870 change in real income between 1967 and 1984, 81% was due
to increases in Social Security benefits. Real earnings of the highest quintile
fell over the 17-year period, but the other components of income increased

sharply. Social Security benefits increased by a factor of 2.5, which is a
higher rate than the rate of the lowest quintile. The category "Other" is, for
the highest quintile, mostly pensions.
The growth in Social Security benefits, especially between 1967 and 1973,
is at least partly due to an upward shift in the benefit schedule, partly to
earlier retirement (which causes a shift in income from earnings to Social
Security benefits), and partly to increasing lifetime contributions of each

cohort. Table 13 gives Social Security benefits of the cohort born in 1893-1897
which, except for mortality, holds constant lifetime earnings. Because most
people had retired by age 70, it also eliminates much of the retirement effect

on benefits. Thus, most of the change will be due to changes in the benefit
schedule.

Between 1967 and January, 1972 the benefit schedule was changed to increase

benefits by 43% holding lifetime earnings constant. A further increase in
September, 1972 raised the total change from 1967 to 72%. Total inflation over
the period was about 25%. In Table 13 mean real benefits increased by about 36%
(38% for the fifth decile) between 1967 and 1972, which is consistent with the
changes in the benefit schedule. Following the increase in 1972, benefits have

been indexed, so any increases in average benefits after retirement come from
compositional effects. (For example, the poor die sooner than the well-to-do,

so average benefits will rise with age.) The table shows, again, the importance
of Social Security benefits, especially for the very elderly: in 1982 they were
70%

of

the income of 85-89 year-olds.

3.4. Poverty

The poverty rate of the elderly is an aspect of income distribution that

has been the object of considerable study probably

because until recently it has

been high and because poverty is especially troubling for the elderly. They
have few ways to recover from a loss of income, so a fall into poverty tends to
be permanent.

The poverty rate is the fraction of a population whose incomes fall below
the poverty line, which varies by age and household composition. The poverty
line for a single elderly person was $5,447 in 1987;
elderly couple.

it was $6,871 for an

I suspect that most people would regard the poverty line as low

indeed, and that someone with income substantially above the poverty line is
still poor.

Table 14 shows that, in line with the increases in income, the poverty

rates of the elderly have declined sharply. By

1984 they were lower than the

poverty rates of the nonelderly, and they remained lower through 1987.12 As
reference to Table 12 shows, the Social Security system can claim a major role

in the rather remarkablereduCtiOn of poverty among the elderly. The decline

was largest for the oldest. Yet their poverty rate remains high for reasons
connected with widowhood, as will be discussed below.
Putting a value on nonmoney income transfers

increases income measures of

the elderly considerably, which should lead to a large reduction in poverty

rates. The following table shows that to be the case.

The table has poverty rates by age for various income measures.'3 The market
measure values nonmoney transfers at cost; the recipient measure values them at
an estimate of their value to the recipient)4 Including food and housing
transfers in income reduces poverty modestly for both elderly and nonelderly.
Due to the size of Medicare and Medicaid, however, including medical transfers

has a large effect: if medical transfers are valued at market cost, the poverty
rate of the elderly was 4.5% in 1979. In my view, the size of the transfer is
so large (about $1,344 in 1979 dollars), especially in relation to the income
levels of the poor elderly, that any poverty rates based on augmented income are

bound to be only suggestive.15 Nonetheless, th implicit transfers in the
Medicare and Medicaid program are large and certainly they are of value to the

poor elderly. The transfers have continued to grow much faster than the rate of
inflation (they grew by about 36% in real terms between 1979 and 1984),
suggesting that the poverty rates of the elderly in Table 14, which were already

below the poverty rates of the nonelderly, would be substantially below
following some adjustment for nonmoney income transfers.
The poverty rate of elderly widows has also declined, but it remains
considerably higher than the poverty rates of the population and of the rest of

the elderly. Some of the poverty is undoubtedly due to the high fraction of the

19

very elderly that are widows:

cet,par. one would expect the very elderly to be

poor simply because they must finance a longer lifetime of consumption from a

given lifetime wealth. Table 15 shows, however, that the explanation is more
complicated. It is true that widows aged 72 and over had higher poverty rates
than widows aged 65-71; but younger widows had poverty

rates at least as high.

One explanation is differential mortality by income level: husbands in
poor families die sooner than husbands in well-to-do families. For example, in
the R}1S the poverty rate in 1969 of couples who survived intact during the

entire ten years of the R}tS was 7.6%. The poverty rate in 1969 of couples in
which the husband eventually died during the ten years of the R}IS was 11.7%

(Holden, Burkhauser and Myers, 1986). One might think the difference in poverty
rates is caused by health expenditures in the

several years before the husband's

death; but the association with poverty in 1969 and eventual widowhood lasts
over many years. For example, the poverty rate in 1969 of couples in which the
husband died between 1977 and 1979 was 9.2%, again compared with 7.6% for
couples intact between 1969 and 1979.

Mortality rates are also associated with wealth levels (Table 16). couples
in the 1977 RIIS were divided into two groups: those who survived intact between

197] and 1979 (surviving couples) and those in which

the husband died between

1977 and 1979 (widowed couples). The table gives median
six R1{S surveys (covering the years 1969 to 1979) by

the wealth categories show that the surviving couples

wealth in each of the

that classification. All
had higher wealth than the

widowed couples as early as 1969, more than eight years before the husband

died)6 These results imply that the widowed couple would have had fewer assets
had the husband survived, and, therefore, would have had a higher probability of

being in povertyJ7

The causes of the differential mortality are not known,

but there is some indication that lifetime health differences play a role.
Table 16 shows that Social Security wealth and pension wealth,

20

both of which are

good summaries of lifetime earnings, were higher for the surviving couples.18
This suggests that lifetime health differences affect both lifetime earnings and
mortality rates after retirement, causing the observed correlation.

Beyond differential mortality the transition to widowhood itself seems to

induce poverty. Table 17 gives poverty rates by marital transition between 1975
and 1977 for the entire sample of 1975 couples and for the 1975 couples not in

poverty in 1975. The table shows that widowed couples (1975-1977) had somewhat
but not greatly higher poverty rates than the other couples in the years before

the husbands died. However, in the first survey year after the husbands deaths
the poverty rate of the surviving widows rose to 42% while the poverty rate of

the intact couples was just 7%. Other calculations (not given here) show that
the average increase in poverty following widowhood was 30%. The increase is
partly due to income mismeasureinent associated with the husband's death

(Burkhauser, Holden and Myers, 1986), but mostly due to permanent changes in

economic resources as shown by the high poverty rate in 1979. The two righthand columns give poverty of couples that were above the poverty line in 1975.
37% of the surviving widows, none of whom had been in poverty in 1975, were in
poverty in 1977.

One might well imagine that much of the increase in poverty at the

husband's death is due to the termination of his earnings. Apparently, however,
this is not the case: using RHS data Burkhauser, Holden and Feaster (1988)
studied the determinants of the hazard of poverty of widows, the probability of

entering poverty among those not already in poverty. Only 10.1% of the
transitions into poverty were associated with the loss of the husband's

earnings. About two-thirds of the cases were associated with widowhood itself
and with a decline in nonwage income, particularly Social Security. Even after
the husband's retirement (so that he had no earnings), the probability of a
transition into poverty when the husband dies is high (Holden, Burkhauser and

21

Feaster, 1988)

Changes in the components of wealth at the husband's death provide some

explanation for the high poverty rates of widows. Among the widowed couples,
wealth in all the categories declined between 1977 and 1979 (Table lG).19
Similar calculations over all transition years in the R}IS show that total median

wealth declined by 31% during the years of the husband's death compared with an
increase of 2% over the same years among surviving couples.

Most of the loss is

in Social Security wealth, which is to be expected: according to the Social
Security rules the couple's benefit is reduced when the husband dies. For
couples of this age and cohort the typical reduction would be about 33% of the

couple's benefit. Because the poverty line of a single elderly person is just
21% below the poverty line of an elderly couple, the difference in the changes
in Social Security benefits and the poverty line will itself cause some widows

to become poor. There is no particular reason to believe that either factor
properly reflects returns to scale in consumption:

both are arbitrary.

Table 16 shows that pension wealth declines sharply when the husband dies:
at the time of the RHS most husbands did not have pensions with survivorship

rights (Myers, Burkhauser and Maiden, 1986). The Retirement Equity Act of 1984
is meant to encourage the choice of a pension with survivorship rights.
Previously the pension beneficiary (typically the husband)

could choose a

pension with no survivorship rights. Since 1984 the pension will have
survivorship rights unless both the husband and the wife request otherwise.
Simulations over the RIIS population show that changing all pensions to have

survivorship rights would have raised substantially the incomes of those widows

whose husbands had pensions without survivor's benefits. However, the poverty
rate of all widows would have been remained high, about 22%, compared with 26%

before the change. The effect on the poverty rate was small for two reasons:
first, about 30% of pensions had survivor's benefits already; second, there is

22

a strong positive association between economic status and pension eligibility,

so that few of the poor widows would have been eligible for pension benefits
even with sur-vivorship rights. This general result should carry over to the

population. It is hard to see that survivorship rights to pensions will have a
large impact on the high poverty rates of widows.

The causes of the high rates of poverty among elderly widows are varied and

complex. Some families reach retirement already poor or near poor. Were the
husband to survive the family would have a high risk of poverty, but. because
husbands in poor families tend to die sooner than husbands in wealthy families,

often the widow inherits the family's poverty. In addition some sources of
income drop when the husband dies and some wealth is reduced. How much poverty
is due to the spending of assets as an individual ages is not clear. Cross-

section poverty rates have cohort effects: the oldest are from cohorts that had
lower lifetime earnings. We need panel data over, say, 20 years to control for
cohort effects: we could then observe the life cycle effects.

3.5. Wealth.

Although income is practically the only measure of economic status in use,
life cycle considerations suggest that, at least for the retired elderly, wealth

is a better measure because it measures consumption opportunities. However, the
kinds of intergenerational comparisons that are based on income cannot easily be
made using wealth because a large fraction of the wealth of workers is future

earnings, which are not observed. Even wealth comparisons among the retired
elderly of different ages are not straightforward because of variation in life

expectancy: for example, who is better off, a 70 year-old with $100,000 or an
80 year-old with $50,000? One could, of course, calculate the annuity each
could purchase to translate the comparison into income terms, but the

23

consumption path implied by the annuity might not be the desired path.

Another

method would be to ask whether the 70 year-old he would have more or less than

$50,000 should he life to 80. This involves finding the optimal consumption
path. Although there has been some research on consumption paths

of the elderly

(to be discussed later), the research is not well-enough advanced to make

confident comparisons based on the estimated paths. Notwithstanding these
problems of comparison, wealth data are a valuable alternative or supplement to
income data.

The following table has estimates of average bequeathable wealth of the
elderly.

Both the Survey of Program Participation (SIPP) and the Survey of Consumer

Finances (SCF) without supplement are self-weighting samples.21 The estimates
of mean wealth differ somewhat but they are probably not significantly

different. (Given the typical dispersion of wealth, the standard errors are
bound to be very large.) The SCF with supplement differs from the SCF without
supplement by the addition of 438 high income households.22 Even though both of
the SCF estimates of mean wealth are weighted by the sampling weights, so that,
in principle, the means should be the same, the estimates are widely different.

This happens because wealth is so highly concentrated. (The Cmi coefficient in

24

the wealth of the elderly is 0.78 from the SCF with supplement (McDermed, Clark

and Allen, 1987), whereas the Cmi coefficient of income is about 0.35. The
fraction of wealth in the top 1% of the wealth distribution is about 35%) The
high concentration of wealth, makes it difficult to find wealth measures that

represent the situation of most of the elderly. An alternative to the mean is,
of course, the median. But it has drawbacks for studying the sources of wealth,
which has been an important research topic: the medians of the wealth
components cannot be aggregated and some categories will have medians of zero.
For these reasons and for comparability with the RMS and other data sets (which

are self-weighting), I analyze mean wealth from the SCF without supplement and
from the SIPP.

Mean wealth of the elderly was about $100,000 in these data sets. This
does not include a few asset categories such as consumer durables, but much more
important from the point of view of describing available resources it does not

include any claim on Social Security, pensions or Medicare/Medicaid. At a real
interest rate of 3% the assets add just $3,000 per year to income from other

sources. This is about 18% of the average household income of the elderly in
1983 ($16,386). Should an elderly person consume part of the wealth as he ages,

the wealth could make a much higher contribution to consumption. Suppose, for
example, a 70 year-old woman chose a flat consumption over 15 years, which is

about her life expectancy. At a real interest rate of 3%, she could consume
$8,300 per year (1983$) from the wealth. This is about 51% of average income in
1983. Of course, a flat consumption path is probably not optimal (she might
live to 86), but the example implies that, on average, wealth accumulation for
retirement is adequate, provided the wealth is consumed.

To form a complete picture of the resources of the elderly we need more
inclusive wealth measures than are available from either the SCF or the SIPP.

Table 18 has fully inclusive average net wealth from the 1975 and 1979 RHS. The

25

ages of most of the heads of households were 64-69 in 1975 and 68-73 in 1979, so
the table shows wealth near the beginning of retirement.

In fact, future

earnings accounted for only 6% of wealth in 1975 and 3% in 1979, so, practically
speaking, the sample had retired by 1979.

Financial wealth includes stocks and

bonds, savings accounts and so forth. Flows (all but the first three entries)
are converted to stocks through actuarial discounting,
depending on the flow.

either real or nominal

SSI. is Supplemental Security Income, a means-tested old

age welfare program. Transfers

includes transfers from relatives and children.

Medicare and Medicaid is the expected present value of the per household
transfer through the Medicare and. Medicaid program evaluated at cost,

the market

value discussed earlier.23
The average wealth levels are reasonably high and consistent with
independent measures of income and wealth.24 I imagine, however, that most
people would be surprised at how little saving is in the conventional form of

financial, business and property wealth: about 22% in 1975 and 23% in 1979.
Adding in housing equity to find the fraction of saving that takes place at the

household level brings these figures to 36% and 41%. Pensions

and Social

Security, which are savings done by firms and society on behalf of the

household, accounted for 46% in 1975. Both in levels and as percentages of
total wealth, the sum of pensions and Social Security fell between 1975 and 1979
because of higher mortality discounting as the R}IS sample aged, and,

in the case

of pensions, because inflation reduced the real value. Undoubtedly, for the
same reasons I discussed earlier in connection with the valuation of the income
flow from Medicare and Medicaid, the most controversial entry is the wealth

value of Medicare and Medicaid.25 It accounted for 10% of wealth in 1975 and
12% in 1979.26 Its value rose between 1975 and 1979 despite the aging of the
RHS population (the actuarial discounting is higher at greater ages)

because

the growth in Medicare and Medicaid transfers was much higher than the inflation

26

rate.

The level of wealth in the lowest wealth decile is low indeed, and consists

almost entirely of wealth from public programs. Any underreporting is not
likely to be substantial because most underreporting is associated with
financial assets; but even allowing for some, it is clear that many elderly

reach retirement with very little. Research has not discovered why this
happens.

27

Notes

1. An additional reason for this difference is that women tend to marry older
men.

2. A households is classified as elderly if the "householder" is elderly;
earnings can come from a nonelderly spouse.

3. In much of this section I use averages or other summary measures. The
elderly are a very diverse population, however, so

the averages will mask the 4.

Although the consumption bundles of the elderly and the nonelderly are somewhat
different, a Laspayres index based on the consumption bundle of the elderly has
varied little from the CPI over either short or long time periods (Boskin and

Hurd, 1985; Bridges and Packard, 1982). Therefore, I use the CPI to convert
nominal dollars to real dollars unless the original research used some other
index.

5. The poverty scaling is rather arbitrarily based on food consumption in 1955
(Palmer, Smeeding and Jencks, 1988).

6. In 1984 average hourly real nonagricultural earnings were almost exactly the
same as in 1967. Table B-44, 1988 Economic Report of the President.

7. The table does not show the experience of any cohort; it measures changes
in the means of the deciles of each age interval.

8. There was, of course, some change in composition due to mortality between
1979 and 1984, which probably tended to increase average income.

This issue

will be discussed later in connection with age-related wealth changes.

9. The validation study used outside information from Social Security and IRS
records to check the accuracy of income items in the 1973 CPS.

10. In addition to the studies already discussed, see Boskin and Shoven (1987);
Danziger et. al. (1984a, l984b); Hurd and Shoven (1982, 1984); Ross Danziger
and Smolensky (1987).

11. Income is observed cash income from the CPS adjusted for household size

I

according to the poverty scale.

12. In 1987 the

poverty

rate of the elderly was 12.2% and of the population was

13.5%. This more recent data does not have the age detail of Table 14.
13. The entries under money income vary from the official poverty levels (and
front the levels in Table 14) because of difference is weighting.

14. The method aims to find the expenditures the recipient family would have
made, given its characteristics and income, if it had purchased the nonmoney

transfers in markets. The ratio of the estimated expenditures to the market
value of the transfers in the benefit weight. The benefit weight for Medicare
and Medicaid transfers is 0.42 (Smeeding, 1982).

IS. For example, it seems unlikely that if a two-person elderly household at
the poverty line ($4,400) were given an additional $1,344 and the opportunity to
buy into the Medicare and Medicaid program, it would choose to spend the full
$1,344 in such a way.
16. Table 16 is an example of many similar results obtained when the
classification is by marital transition in other years.
17. Similar results have been obtained by Jianakoplos et al (1989) in the
National Longitudinal Survey of older men.
18.

Age will cause differences in the wealth measures of Social Security and

pensions because the discounting that converts the future flows to stocks rises

with age. But the wealth differences are too large to be caused by age
differences: the husbands in the widowed couples were about 0.35 year older
than the husbands in the surviving couples.

19. Earnings are not shown in the table: because the husbands were 66-71 year
old in 1977, median earnings were zero.

20. Family unit wealth in the SCF; household wealth in the SIPP.
21. Wealth includes financial assets, real estate, and housing equity,

of debts. It excludes pension and Social Security wealth, the cash

2

all net

value of

life insurance and household durables. The SCF also excludes the value of
automobiles and equity in small businesses and farms. The sample sizes are 3824
(SCF) and 18,700 (SIPP) all ages included.

22. Although weights are given for the high income households, it is by no
means clear that weighted averages are accurate: only 9% of the high income
families that were asked to participate in the survey responded that they would

participate. This raises obvious questions about the representativeness of the
sample.

23. This is the method used by Smeeding (1989), and by Clark, et. al. (1984).
24. For example, Smeeding (1989) calculates full income of the elderly to be
$13,423; if the wealth in 1979 were annuitized at a 7% interest rate and 4%
mortality rate, it would yield $16,137. Given that this applies to 68-73 year
olds who are more wealthy than older cohorts, the figures seem quite consistent.
Radner (1989) reports mean financial and housing wealth of 65-74 year-olds from

the SIPP to be $99,800, which is $69,700 in 1979 dollars. The comparable wealth
figure in the 1979 RES, when most heads of households were 68-73, is $71,100.

However, both the 81FF and the RHS wealth figures are substantially below the

SCF (without supplement) wealth figures: for 65-74 year-olds they are $91,300
in 1979 dollars.

25. The market valuation for most elderly may be fairly accurate: many elderly
purchase additional medical insurance beyond Medicare and Medicaid. This
indicates that, from Medicare and Medicaid alone, they are not at a corner
solution in their demand for medical coverage, and that, apart from wealth

effects, market valuation is appropriate. This argument would not hold for the
poor elderly many of whom do not purchase additional medical coverage (U.S.
Senate Special Committee on Aging).

26. These fractions are very close to the fraction of income from Medicare and
Medicaid (10%) in Smeeding (1989).
