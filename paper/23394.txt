NBER Working Paper No. 23394

JEL No. G12,G14
ABSTRACT
The anomalies literature is infested with widespread p-hacking. We replicate the entire anomalies
literature in finance and accounting by compiling a largest-to-date data library that contains 447
anomaly variables. With microcaps alleviated via New York Stock Exchange breakpoints and
value-weighted returns, 286 anomalies (64%) including 95 out of 102 liquidity variables (93%)
are insignificant at the conventional 5% level. Imposing the cutoff t-value of three raises the
number of insignificance to 380 (85%). Even for the 161 significant anomalies, their magnitudes
are often much lower than originally reported. Out of the 161, the q-factor model leaves 115
alphas insignificant (150 with t < 3). In all, capital markets are more efficient than previously
recognized.

Introduction

This paper conducts a gigantic replication of the entire anomalies literature by compiling a
largest-to-date data library with 447 anomaly variables. The list includes 57, 68, 38, 79, 103,
and 102 variables from the momentum, value-versus-growth, investment, profitability, intangibles,
and trading frictions categories, respectively. We use a consistent set of replication procedures
throughout. To control for microcaps that are smaller than the 20th percentile of market equity
for New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) stocks, we form testing deciles with NYSE breakpoints and
value-weighted returns. We treat an anomaly as a replication success if the average return of its
high-minus-low decile is significant at the 5% level (t ≥ 1.96).
Our results indicate widespread p-hacking in the anomalies literature. Out of 447 anomalies,
286 (64%) are insignificant at the 5% level. Imposing the cutoff t-value of three proposed by Harvey,
Liu, and Zhu (2016) raises the number of insignificant anomalies further to 380 (85%).
The biggest casualty is the liquidity literature. In the trading frictions category that contains
mostly liquidity variables, 95 out of 102 variables (93%) are insignificant. Prominent variables
that do not survive our replication include the Jegadeesh (1990) short-term reversal; the DatarNaik-Radcliffe (1998) share turnover; the Chordia-Subrahmanyam-Anshuman (2001) coefficient of
variation for dollar trading volume; the Amihud (2002) absolute return-to-volume; the AcharyaPedersen (2005) liquidity betas; the Ang-Hodrick-Xing-Zhang (2006) idiosyncratic volatility, total
volatility, and systematic volatility; the Liu (2006) number of zero daily trading volume; and the
Corwin-Schultz (2012) high-low bid-ask spread. Several recently proposed friction variables are also
insignificant, including the Bali-Cakici-Whitelaw (2011) maximum daily return; the Adrian-EtulaMuir (2014) financial intermediary leverage beta; and the Kelly-Jiang (2014) tail risk.
The distress anomaly is virtually nonexistent in our replication. The Campbell-Hilscher-Szilagyi
(2008) failure probability, the O-score and Z-score studied in Dichev (1998), and the AvramovChordia-Jostova-Philipov (2009) credit rating all produce insignificant average return spreads.
1

Other prominent but insignificant variables include the Bhandari (1988) debt-to-market; the
Lakonishok-Shleifer-Vishny (1994) five-year sales growth; several of the Abarbanell-Bushee (1998)
fundamental signals; the Diether-Malloy-Scherbina (2002) dispersion in analysts’ forecast; the
Gompers-Ishii-Metrick (2003) corporate governance index; the Francis-LaFond-Olsson-Schipper
(2004) earnings attributes, including persistence, smoothness, value relevance, and conservatism;
the Francis et al. (2005) accruals quality; the Richardson-Sloan-Soliman-Tuna (2005) total accruals;
and the Fama-French (2015) operating profits-to-book equity.
Even for significant anomalies, their magnitudes are often much lower than originally reported.
Prominent examples include the Jegadeesh-Titman (1993) price momentum; the LakonishokShleifer-Vishny (1994) cash flow-to-price; the Sloan (1996) operating accruals; the Chan-JegadeeshLakonishok (1996) earnings momentum, formed on standardized unexpected earnings, abnormal
returns around earnings announcements, and revisions in analysts’ earnings forecasts; the CohenFrazzini (2008) customer momentum; and the Cooper-Gulen-Schill (2008) asset growth.
We then use the q-factor model to explain the 161 significant anomalies. The q-factor model
explains the bulk of the anomalies, but still leaves 46 alphas significant (11 with t ≥ 3). Examples
include abnormal returns around earnings announcements, operating and discretionary accruals,
cash-based operating profits-to-assets, R&D-to-market, and the Heston-Sadka (2008) seasonality
anomalies. These anomalies tend to be relatively diffused, and do not comove strongly together.
Why does our replication differ so much from original studies? The key word is microcaps. Fama
and French (2008) show that microcaps represent only 3% of the total market capitalization of the
NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ universe, but account for 60% of the number of stocks. Microcaps not only
have the highest equal-weighted returns, but also the largest cross-sectional standard deviations
in returns and anomaly variables among microcaps, small stocks, and big stocks. Many studies
overweight microcaps with equal-weighted returns, and often together with NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ
breakpoints, in portfolio sorts. Many studies also use Fama-MacBeth (1973) cross-sectional regres-

2

sions of returns on anomaly variables, assigning even higher weights to microcaps than equal-weights
in portfoio sorts, because regressions impose a linear functional form. Unfortunately, because of
high costs in trading these stocks, anomalies in microcaps are more apparent than real.
Our contribution is to provide the largest-to-date replication in finance. Using a multiple testing
framework, Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2016) cast doubt on the credibility of the anomalies literature,
and conclude that “most claimed research findings in financial economics are likely false (p. 5).”
Harvey et al. do not attempt to replicate the anomalies. In contrast, we replicate the entire published anomalies literature with a common set of procedures. We also present extensive evidence on
the relative successes and weaknesses of the q-factor model in explaining the significant anomalies.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature on replication, and motivates our large-scale effort. Section 3 constructs the 447 anomalies, and details
our replication results. Section 4 uses the q-factor model to explain significant anomalies. Finally,
Section 5 summarizes our results, and discusses implications for future work.

Motivating Replication

Finance academics have long warned against the danger of data mining. Lo and MacKinlay (1990)
argue that future research is often motivated by the successes and failures of past investigations.
As a result, few empirical studies are free of data snooping biases, which become more severe as the
number of published studies performed on a single data set increases. The more scrutiny a single
data set is subject to, the more likely spurious patterns will emerge. Fama (1998) shows that many
anomalies tend to weaken and even disappear when measured with value-weights. Conrad, Cooper,
and Kaul (2003) argue that data snooping can account for up to one half of the in-sample relations
between firm characteristics and average returns in one-way sorts. Schwert (2003) shows that after
anomalies are documented in the academic literature, they often seem to disappear, reverse, or
weaken. McLean and Pontiff (2016) study the out-of-sample performance of 97 anomalies, and find
that their average high-minus-low returns decline out of sample and post publication. However,
3

McLean and Pontiff use NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints and equal-weights in their tests.
As hundreds of anomalies have been documented in recent decades, the concern over data mining has become especially acute. In a prominent study, Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2016) present a
new multiple testing framework to derive threshold statistical significant levels to account for data
mining in the anomalies literature. The threshold cutoff increases over time as more anomalies
have been data-mined. A newly discovered factor today should have a t-statistic exceeding three.
Reevaluating 296 significant anomalies in past published studies, Harvey et al. report that 80–158
(27%–53%) are false discoveries, depending on the specific methods of adjusting for multiple testing. The estimates are likely conservative because many factors have been tried by empiricists,
failed, and never been reported (and consequently unobservable).
Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2016) suggest that two types of publication bias are likely responsible
for the high percentage of false discoveries. The first type of bias is that it is difficult to publish a
negative result in top academic journals. The second, more subtle type of publication bias is that
it is difficult to publish replication studies in finance and economics, while in many other scientific
fields, replication studies routinely appear in top journals. As a result, financial economists tend to
focus on publishing new factors rather than rigorously verifying the validity of published factors.
Harvey (2017) elaborates the complex agency problem behind the publication biases. Journal
editors compete for citation-based impact factors, and prefer to publish papers with the most significant results. In response to this incentive, authors often file away papers with results that are
weak or negative, instead of submitting them for publication. More disconcertingly, authors often
engage in p-hacking, i.e., selecting sample criteria and test procedures until insignificant results
become significant. The likely outcome is an embarrassingly large number of false positives that
cannot be repeated in the future. Harvey provides a Bayesian p-value as a remedy that incorporates
the economic plausibility of the testable hypothesis as part of the statistical inference.
Yan and Zheng (2017) form about 18,000 fundamental signals, use bootstrapping to quantify

4

data mining, and find that top signals exhibit superior forecasting power of returns above and
beyond sample variation. By permutating 240 accounting variables with 15 base variables and five
different ways of scaling, Yan and Zheng include both published variables and those that have likely
been tried but not reported. However, this approach is feasible only to accounting variables and
variables based on past returns. In contrast, we include many other variables such as intangibles and
liquidity variables as well as composite measures such as failure probability and fundamental score
in the published literature. More important, Yan and Zheng construct high-minus-low deciles with
NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ, as opposed to NYSE breakpoints, allowing microcaps to populate extreme
deciles. This practice most likely exaggerates anomaly profits, especially in equal-weighted returns.
The anomalies literature is the scientific foundation for the quantitative asset management
industry. Since the mid-1990s, factors-based exchange traded funds have experienced spectacular
growth.

By mid-2016, these funds own about 1.35 trillion dollars in the U.S. stock market,

accounting for about 10% of the market capitalization of traded securities (Ben-David, Franzoni,
and Moussawi 2016). As factor investing becomes increasingly important, the financial press has
rightfully called into question the reliability of the underlying academic research. For example, Coy
(2017) writes: “Most investors have a vague sense they’re being ripped off. Here’s how it happens.”
“[R]esearchers have more knobs to twist in search of a prized ‘anomaly’ — a subtle pattern in the
data that looks like it could be a moneymaker. They can vary the period, the set of securities under
consideration, or even the statistical method. Negative findings go in a file drawer; positive ones get
submitted to a journal (tenure!) or made into an ETF whose performance we rely on for retirement.”
Finance is only the latest field that starts to take replication of published empirical results seriously. In economics, Leamer (1983) emphasizes the lack of robustness to changes in specifications in
empirical work, and proposes to “take the con out of econometrics” by reporting extensive sensitivity
analysis to show how key results vary with perturbations in regression specification and functional
form. In a pioneering study, Dewald, Thursby, and Anderson (1986) attempt to replicate empirical
results published at Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, and find that inadvertent errors are so
5

commonplace that the original results often cannot be reproduced. Dewald et al. write: “The replication of research is an essential component of scientific methodology. Only through replication of
the results of others can scientists unify the disparate findings of various researchers in a discipline
into a defensible, consistent, coherent body of knowledge (p. 600).” McCullough and Vinod (2003)
report that nonlinear maximization routines from different software packages often produce very
different estimates, and many articles published at American Economic Review fail to test their
solutions across different software packages. McCullough and Vinod emphasize: “Replication is the
cornerstone of science. Research that cannot be replicated is not science, and cannot be trusted
either as part of the profession’s accumulated body of knowledge or as a basis for policy (p. 888).”
Chang and Li (2015) replicate less than half of 67 published papers from 13 economics journals.
Collecting more than 50,000 tests published in American Economic Review, Journal of Political Economy, and Quarterly Journal of Economics, Brodeur, Lé, Sangnier, and Zylberberg (2016)
document a troubling two-humped pattern of test statistics. The pattern features a first hump
with high p-values, a sizeable under-representation of p-values just above 5%, and a second hump
with p-values slightly below 5%. The evidence strongly indicates p-hacking that authors search
for specifications that deliver just-significant results and ignore those that give just-insignificant
results to make their work more publishable. The two-humped shape is less visible in articles with
theoretical models, with randomized control trials, and with tenured or older authors.
Reviewing existing evidence on widespread publication bias, lack of replicability, and specification search, Christensen and Miguel (2016, p. 24) suggest: “[A]n overall increase in replication
research will serve a critical role in establishing the credibility of empirical findings in economics,
and in equilibrium, will create stronger incentives for scholars to generate more reliable results.”
Finally, Butera and List (2017) show that a few independent replications can dramatically improve
the reliability of novel findings, and design an incentive-compatible mechanism to promote replications. Butera and List conclude: “Replication exercises should be a pillar of deepening our scientific
understanding, and should play a critical role in any model of building scientific knowledge (p. 23).”
6

More broadly, replication has received much attention in many other disciplines. A provocative
and widely cited article by Ioannidis (2005) argues that most (more than 50%) research findings are
false for most designs and for most fields. Results are more likely to be false when the studies in a
field use smaller samples, when the effect magnitudes are smaller, when there exist many but fewer
theoretically predicted relations, when researchers have greater flexibility in designs, variable definitions, and analytical methods, when there exist greater financial and other interest and bias, and
when more independent teams are involved in a field chasing statistical significance. The Economist
(2013) describes several cases in psychology, biomedical, and other fields, in which the success rate
of replication is extremely low. For instance, scientists at Amgen tried to replicate 53 studies viewed
as landmarks in cancer research, but reproduce the original results in only six. A recent Nature
article by Baker (2016) reports that 80% of the respondents in a survey of 1,576 scientists believe
that there exists a reproducibility crisis in the published scientific literature. Selective reporting,
pressure to publish, and poor use of statistics are three leading causes for the crisis.
Our replication results that 64%–85% of the 447 anomalies are insignificant are consistent with
Ioannidis (2005) and Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2016). In retrospect, the anomalies literature is a prime
target for p-hacking. First, for decades, the literature is purely empirical in nature, with little theoretical guidance. Second, with trillions of dollars invested in anomalies-based strategies in the U.S.
market alone, the financial interest is overwhelming. Third, more significant results make a bigger
splash, and are more likely to lead to publications as well as promotion, tenure, and prestige in
academia. As a result, armies of academics and practitioners engage in searching for anomalies, and
the anomalies literature is most likely one of the biggest areas in finance and accounting. Finally,
as we explain later, empiricists have much flexibility in sample criteria, variable definitions, and
empirical methods, which are all tools of p-hacking in chasing statistical significance.

Replication

We replicate the anomalies literature using a common set of procedures. Table 1 shows the list of
447 anomalies, including 57, 68, 38, 79, 103, and 102 variables from the momentum, value-versusgrowth, investment, profitability, intangibles, and trading frictions categories, respectively. Appendix A details variable definitions and portfolio construction. We use the same sample throughout. Monthly returns are from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and accounting
information from the Compustat Annual and Quarterly Fundamental Files. The sample is from
January 1967 to December 2014. Financial firms and firms with negative book equity are excluded.
Section 3.1 describes our replication procedures. Section 3.2 details the anomalies that are
insignificant at the conventional 5% level. Finally, Section 3.3 shows that even for significant
anomalies, their magnitudes are often much lower than those reported in their original articles.

3.1

A Common Set of Replicating Procedures

To test whether an anomaly variable can forecast returns reliably, we form testing deciles with NYSE
breakpoints and value-weighted returns. For annually sorted testing deciles, we sort all stocks at
the end of June of each year t into deciles based on, for instance, book-to-market at the fiscal year
ending in calendar year t − 1, and calculate decile returns from July of year t to June of t + 1.
For monthly sorted portfolios involving latest earnings data, we use earnings data in Compustat quarterly files in the months immediately after the quarterly earnings announcement dates.
For monthly sorted portfolios involving quarterly accounting data other than earnings, we impose
a four-month lag between the fiscal quarter end and subsequent stock returns. Unlike earnings,
other quarterly items are typically not available upon earnings announcement dates. Many firms
announce their earnings for a given quarter through a press release, and then file SEC reports
several weeks later. In particular, Easton and Zmijewski (1993) document a median reporting lag
of 46 days for NYSE/Amex firms and 52 days for NASDAQ firms. Chen, DeFond, and Park (2002)
also report that only 37% of quarterly earnings announcements include balance sheet information.
8

For monthly sorted anomalies, we include three different holding periods (1-, 6-, and 12-month).
Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok (1996), for example, emphasize the short-lived nature of momentum, by examining how momentum profits vary with the holding periods. As such, it is economically
interesting to study how monthly sorted anomalies vary across different holding periods.
Our data library with 447 anomalies is among the largest in the existing literature. Green,
Hand, and Zhang (2013) reference 330 anomaly papers, but code up only 39 variables. Green,
Hand, and Zhang (2016) and McLean and Pontiff (2016) program about 100 anomaly variables.
Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2016) compile a list of 316 papers, but many variables are macroeconomic
in nature, such as aggregate consumption growth. Also, Harvey et al. do not attempt replication. As noted, Yan and Zheng (2017) form about 18,000 fundamental signals, but these are from
permutating 240 accounting variables with 15 base variables and five different ways of scaling.
Following Beaver, McNichols, and Price (2007), we adjust monthly stock returns for delisting
returns by compounding returns in the month before delisting with delisting returns from CRSP.
When a delisting return is missing, we replace it with the mean of available delisting returns of the
same delisting type and stock exchange in the prior 60 months. Appendix B details our delisting
adjustment procedure. Adjusting for delisting returns has little impact on our empirical results.
3.1.1

Why Portfolio Sorts with NYSE Breakpoints and Value-weighted Returns

Empiricists in the anomalies literature have much flexibility in test designs. Some studies exclude
stocks with prices per share lower than $1 or $5. We do not impose such a sample screen. Many
studies also equal-weight portfolio returns. We instead use value-weights.
We do so for several reasons. First, value-weights more accurately reflect the wealth effect
experienced by investors, as emphasized by Fama (1998). Second, Fama and French (2008) document that microcaps are influential in equal-weighted returns. Microcaps are stocks with the
market equity below the 20th percentile of NYSE stocks. Microcaps are on average only 3% of
the market value of the NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ universe, but account for about 60% of the total
9

number of stocks. Due to high transaction costs and illiquidity, anomalies in microcaps are unlikely
to be exploitable in practice. Finally, building on Blume and Stambaugh (1983), Asparouhova,
Bessembinder, and Kalcheva (2013) show that microstructure frictions, such as bid-ask spreads,
nonsynchronous trading, discrete prices, and order imbalances, can bias upward cross-sectional
monthly mean equal-weighted returns. In contrast, the bias in value-weighted returns is minimal.
When forming portfolios, many studies use NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints, as opposed to
NYSE breakpoints. We use NYSE breakpoints because the cross-sectional dispersion of anomaly
variables is the largest among microcaps. Fama and French (2008) document that microcaps
have the highest cross-sectional standard deviations of returns and many anomaly variables. With
NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints, microcaps typically account for more than 60% of the stocks
in extreme deciles. These microcaps can greatly inflate the anomalies, especially when combined
with equal-weights. In contrast, using NYSE breakpoints assigns a fair number of small and big
stocks into extreme deciles, alleviating the impact of microcaps.
Hundreds of anomaly studies use Fama-MacBeth (1973) cross-sectional regressions of returns
on anomaly variables. We opt to use portfolio sorts, for several reasons. First, cross-sectional
regressions, most often performed with ordinary least squares, can be dominated by microcaps because of their plentifulness. The slopes in these regressions are returns to zero-investment portfolios
(Fama 1976). In this sense, cross-sectional regressions are analogous to sorts with NYSE-AmexNASDAQ breakpoints and equal-weights. Second, cross-sectional regressions in fact assign even
more weights on microcaps than equal-weights. Because regressions impose a linear functional
form between average returns and anomaly variables, they are more susceptible to outliers, volatile
returns and values of anomaly variables, which most likely belong to microcaps. In contrast, the
largely nonparametric sorts do not impose such a linear functional form. Using weighted least
squares with the market equity as weights alleviates the concern on equal-weights, but not the
concern on NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints or that on the linear functional form. In addition,
the zero-investment portfolios constructed from cross-sectional regressions often involve extremely
10

high turnover and leverage, especially with many regressors. Finally, collinearity can be a serious
problem for cross-sectional regressions with many anomaly variables. For example, two individually
insignificant variables that are highly correlated can show up significant when used together.
Table 2 updates Fama and French’s (2008) Table I in our 1967–2014 sample. Panel A shows that
on average, there are 2,406 microcaps, which account for 61% of the total number of firms, 3,938.
However, microcaps represent only 3.28% of the total market capitalization, small stocks 6.77%,
and big stocks 90%. With equal-weights, microcaps earn on average 1.32% per month relative to
1.03% for big stocks. In contrast, the value-weighted market return of 0.93% is close to 0.92%
for big stocks. More important, microcaps have the highest cross-sectional standard deviations of
(monthly) returns, 19.1%, followed by small stocks, 11.9%, and then by big stocks, 8.9%. Panel
B shows further that except for earnings surprise (Sue), the cross-sectional dispersions in anomaly
variables are the largest for microcaps, followed by small stocks, and then big stocks. The evidence
lends support to our replication procedure with NYSE breakpoints and value-weights.

3.2

Anomalies That Cannot be Replicated

We treat an anomaly a replication failure if the average return of its high-minus-low decile is insignificant at the 5% level (t < 1.96). This t-value cutoff is quite lenient from our perspective
in that we view a t-value no lower than 1.96 as a success. Despite our lax criterion, Table 3 reports that 286 out of 447 anomaly variables (64%) earn insignificant high-minus-low returns on
average, including 20, 37, 11, 46, 77, and 95 anomalies from the momentum, value-versus-growth,
investment, profitability, intangibles, and trading frictions categories, respectively. We detail the
insignificant anomalies, and discuss possible procedural sources for their failed replications.
3.2.1

Momentum

Panel A of Table 3 reports 20 insignificant momentum anomalies. The high-minus-low earnings
surprise (Sue) deciles at the 6- and 12-month horizons earn on average 0.19% and 0.11% per month
(t = 1.65 and 1.00), respectively. These estimates are lower than those in Chan, Jegadeesh, and
11

Lakonishok (1996), who report 6- and 12-month buy-and-hold returns of 6.8% and 7.5%, respectively. The differences likely arise because Chan et al. equal-weight the decile returns, and also skip
five days after portfolio formation before calculating returns. We value-weight decile returns, and
calculate holding period returns immediately after the portfolio formation.
The high-minus-low revenue surprise (Rs) decile at the 6-month horizon earns an average return
of only 0.14% per month (t = 1.01). This estimate is lower than the average 6-month buy-and-hold
abnormal return of 4.42% for the high-minus-low quintile reported by Jegadeesh and Livnat (2006).
Jegadeesh and Livnat form quintiles with NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints and equal-weighted
returns. Also, abnormal returns are calculated against the size and book-to-market benchmark
portfolios, which are in turn value-weighted. The high-minus-low tax expense surprise (Tes) deciles
at the 1-, 6-, and 12-month horizons earn average returns of 0.26%, 0.28%, and 0.18% per month (t =
1.56, 1.90, and 1.34), respectively. These estimates are lower than the average 3-month buy-and-hold
return of 3.9% reported by Thomas and Zhang (2011). Thomas and Zhang form the Tes deciles with
NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints and equal-weighted returns. Also, the time lag between the
fiscal quarter end and subsequent returns is only three months, not four months in our construction.
The high-minus-low segment momentum (Sm) deciles at the 6- and 12-month horizons earn
only 0.09% and 0.14% per month (t = 0.88 and 1.87), respectively. At the 1-month horizon, Table
4 reports that the average return is 0.59% (t = 2.57). The 0.59% estimate is lower than 0.95%
reported in Cohen and Lou (2012). Cohen and Lou use NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints, and
also impose a price screen of $5 at portfolio formation. We use NYSE breakpoints with no price
screen. We also show that the average return is sensitive to the holding period.
Finally, the high-minus-low deciles formed on the industry lead-lag effect in earnings surprises
(Ile) at the 6- and 12-month horizons earn on average 0.27% (t = 1.79) and 0.11% (t = 0.84),
respectively. In contrast, Hou (2007) shows stronger effects at shorter horizons using weekly crosssectional regressions. At the 1-month horizon, Table 4 shows that the high-minus-low Ile decile earns

12

0.62% (t = 3.7), and the industry lead-lag effect in prior returns (Ilr) is significant at all horizons.
3.2.2

Value-versus-growth

Panel B of Table 3 reports 37 insignificant value-versus-growth anomalies. Debt-to-market equity
(Dm) is insignificant in both annual sorts and monthly sorts at all horizons. The average returns
of the high-minus-low deciles vary from 0.27% to 0.32% per month, with t-values from 1.17 to
1.59. The estimates contrast with Bhandari’s (1988) results from cross-sectional regressions. Dividend yield (Dp) and payout yield (Op) are also insignificant in both annual sorts and all monthly
sorts. Our findings contrast with Litzenberger and Ramaswamy’s (1979) results on Dp from crosssectional regressions, as well as Boudoukh, Michaely, Richardson, and Roberts’s (2007) results on
Op based on NYSE breakpoints but equal-weighted returns.
The high-minus-low five-year sales growth (Sr) decile earns an average return of only −0.2% per
month (t = −1.08), which is much lower than 7.3% per annum reported by Lakonishok, Shleifer,
and Vishny (1994) based on NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints and equal-weighted returns. Net
debt-to-price (Ndp) is insignificant in both annual sorts and monthly sorts at all horizons, with
average high-minus-low returns ranging from 0.17% to 0.31% per month, and t-values from 0.71 to
1.62. The average returns are lower than 8.7% per annum reported in Penman, Richardson, and
Tuna (2007) based on NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints and equal-weighted returns.
3.2.3

Investment

Panel C of Table 3 reports 11 insignificant investment anomalies. The high-minus-low decile on
the Richardson-Sloan-Soliman-Tuna (2005) total accruals (Ta) earns an average return of −0.23%
(t = −1.63). In contrast, Richardson et al.’s Table 8 reports a negative slope of Ta more than six
standard errors from zero in cross-sectional regressions of returns. Their Table 10 also shows an
average (size-adjusted) return of 13.3% per annum (t = 10.25) for the high-minus-low Ta decile,
but this estimate is based on NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints and equal-weights.
The high-minus-low deciles on net external finance (Nxf) and net equity finance (Nef) earn on
13

average −0.27% and −0.17% per month (t = −1.44 and −0.86), respectively. These estimates are
lower than 15.5% (t = 5.7) and 11.2% (t = 3.82) per annum reported by Bradshaw, Richardson,
and Sloan (2006) based on NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints and equal-weighted returns.
3.2.4

Profitability

Panel D of Table 3 reports 46 insignificant anomalies in the profitability category. The return
on equity (Roe) is significant mostly within the 6-month horizon. At the 6-month horizon, the
high-minus-low decile earns on average 0.42% (t = 1.95), and at the 12-month, 0.24% (t = 1.19).
The evidence is largely consistent with Fama and French (2006, 2008), who use annual sorts, and
Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015), who use monthly sorts.
Many different measures of profitability have recently been proposed to forecast returns, but not
all are effective. The high-minus-low gross profits-to-lagged assets (Gla) decile earns an average return of only 0.16% per month (t = 1.04). This average return is lower than that of 0.38% (t = 2.62)
for the high-minus-low gross profits-to-assets (Gpa) decile (Table 4). The difference between Gla
and Gpa is that Gla scales gross profits with one-period-lagged assets, but Gpa scales with current
assets. Because both profits and assets are measured at the end of a period in Compustat, profits
should be scaled by lagged assets, which in turn produce current profits. In contrast, the current
assets at the end of a period are accumulated through investment over the current period, and start
to generate profits only in future periods. In addition, because Gpa equals Gla divided by asset
growth (current assets-to-lagged assets), the Gpa effect is confounded with the investment effect.
Purging the investment effect yields an economically small and statistically insignificant Gla effect.
Perhaps surprisingly, the sorting variable underlying the Fama-French (2015) robust-minus-weak
(RMW) profitability factor, which is operating profits-to-book equity (Ope), is also insignificant.
The high-minus-low Ope decile earns an average return of only 0.25% per month (t = 1.2). Ope
scales operating profits with the current book equity. Scaling with the one-period-lagged book
equity as in operating profits-to-lagged book equity (Ole) reduces the average return spread further

14

to 0.07% (t = 0.37). Ball, Gerakos, Linnainmaa, and Nikolaev (2015) add research and development expenses to operating profits, show that the high-minus-low operating profits-to-assets
(Opa) decile earns on average 0.29% (t = 1.95). We replicate their result with an average return
of 0.37% (t = 1.87). However, scaling their operating profits with lagged assets as in operating
profits-to-lagged assets (Ola) reduces the average return to 0.2% (t = 1.07).
A bigger surprise is that the distress anomaly is virtually nonexistent in our replication. In
annual sorts, the high-minus-low failure probability (Fp) decile earns an average return of −0.38%
per month (t = −1.28) from July 1976 to December 2014. This estimate is much lower than 9.66%
per annum reported by Campbell, Hilscher, and Szilagyi (2008) in the 1981–2003 sample. We replicate their estimate in their sample period with an average return of −0.82% per month (t = −2.1).
However, outside their sample, the average return is 0.69% from July 1976 to December 1980 and
0.09% from 2003 onward. In monthly sorts, the average returns are −0.48% and −0.36% at the
1- and 12-month horizons, respectively, but both are within 1.5 standard errors from zero. At the
6-month horizon, the average return is −0.63% (t = −2.03) (Table 4). Finally, while Campbell et
al. use NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints, we use NYSE breakpoints.
Several alternative measures of financial distress, including Altman’s (1968) Z-score (Z),
Ohlson’s (1980) O-score (O), and credit rating (Cr), show even weaker forecasting power for returns than failure probability. None of the high-minus-low deciles show any significant average
returns in either annual sorts or monthly sorts at any horizons. In particular, the average returns
of the high-minus-low O deciles range from −0.06% (t = −0.3) to −0.36% per month (t = −1.57),
and those of the high-minus-low Z deciles from 0.01% (t = 0.06) to −0.09% (t = −0.46). These
estimates contrast with those in Dichev (1998), who reports an average return of 1.17% (t = 3.36)
for the high-minus-low O decile based on NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints and equal-weighted
returns, as well as a significantly positive slope for Z-score in cross-sectional regressions.
Finally, the high-minus-low credit rating (Cr) deciles all earn average returns that are close

15

to zero at the 1-, 6-, and 12-month horizons. These estimates contrast with Avramov, Chordia,
Jostova, and Philipov (2009), who report a high-minus-low average return of 1.09% per month
(t = 2.61) based on NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints and equal-weighted returns. Besides the
procedural difference, another difference is that Avramov et al. use credit ratings data from Ratings
Xpress, to which we do not have access because it has been discontinued on WRDS.
3.2.5

Intangibles

Panel E of Table 3 reports 77 insignificant anomalies in the intangibles category. R&D-to-sales
(Rds), the Kaplan-Zingales index, and the Whited-Wu index are all insignificant in annual sorts
and monthly sorts at all horizons. This evidence replicates the insignificant results in Chan, Lakonishok, and Sougiannis (2001), Lamont, Polk, and Saa-Requejo (2001), and Whited and Wu (2006).
The high-minus-low hiring rate (Hn) decile earns an average return of −0.27% per month
(t = −1.79). This estimate is lower than 5.61% per annum (t = 2.26) reported in Belo, Lin, and
Bazdresch (2014), who use all-but-microcap breakpoints, and include only firms with December
fiscal year end. We instead use NYSE breakpoints, and include firms with all fiscal year end.
The average returns of the high-minus-low deciles formed on percentage change in sales minus
that in inventory (dSi), percentage change in sales minus that in accounts receivable (dSa), percentage change in gross margin minus that in sales (dGs), percentage change in sales minus that in
SG&A (dSs), and labor force efficiency (Lfe) are all small and insignificant, ranging from 0.04% to
0.2% per month, with t-values from 0.24 to 1.59. For comparison, Abarbanell and Bushee (1998) report insignificant results for dSa, dGs, and Lfe, but significant results for dSi and dSs based on crosssectional regressions. However, while Abarbanell and Bushee report insignificant results for effective
tax rate (Etr), its high-minus-low average return is 0.25% (t = 2.35) in our replication (Table 4).
The high-minus-low corporate governance (Gind) decile earns a tiny average return of 0.02% per
month (t = 0.06) in our sample from September 1990 to December 2006 (the last available date). In
contrast, Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2003) report a significant high-minus-low Gind decile alpha
16

of −0.71% (t = −2.73) in the Carhart (1997) four-factor model in their sample from September
1990 to December 1999. We come close to replicating their result, with a Carhart alpha of −0.59%
(t = −1.88) as well as an average return of −0.73% (t = −2.04) in their sample period. However,
out of their sample from January 2000 to December 2006, the high-minus-low Gind decile earns a
positive average return of 1.01% (t = 2.09), and its Carhart alpha is insignificant, 0.2% (t = 0.56).
The high-minus-low accruals quality (Acq) decile earns a tiny average return of −0.07% per
month (t = −0.36) in annual sorts, and the average returns from monthly sorts are quantitatively
similar. The average returns of the high-minus-low deciles formed on earnings persistence (Eper),
earnings smoothness (Esm), value relevance of earnings (Evr), and earnings conservatism (Ecs) are
all small and insignificant, ranging from −0.06% to 0.18% per month, with t-values from −0.45
to 1.32. These results contrast with Francis, LaFond, Olsson, and Schipper (2004, 2005), who
report that these earnings attributes have significant relations with the cost of equity. Francis et al.
base their inferences on ex ante accounting-based measures of cost of capital, not average realized
returns. Although Francis et al. construct factors based on the earnings attributes, their average
returns are not reported. We emphasize, however, that the two other attributes in their study,
earnings predictability (Eprd) and earnings timeliness (Etl), do produce significant average returns
for their high-minus-low deciles, −0.49% (t = −2.75) and 0.36% (t = 2.85), respectively (Table 4).
The high-minus-low deciles formed on dispersion of analysts’ earnings forecasts (Dis) earn
−0.24%, −0.22%, and −0.13% per month at the 1-, 6-, and 12-month horizons, all of which are
within one standard error from zero. The evidence contrasts with Diether, Malloy, and Scherbina
(2002), who report an average return of −0.79% (t = −2.88) for the low-minus-high Dis quintile at
the 1-month based on NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints and equal-weighted returns. Diether et
al. also exclude stocks with prices per share lower than $5. We do not impose such a price screen.

3.2.6

Trading Frictions

The biggest casualty of p-hacking is the trading frictions (liquidity) category, with 95 out of 102
variables (93%) insignificant. Panel F of Table 3 shows that 15 out of 16 volatility measures earn
insignificant average returns for their high-minus-low deciles. In particular, the high-minus-low
deciles on idiosyncratic volatility calculated from the Fama-French (1993) three-factor model (Ivff)
earn on average −0.51%, −0.33%, and −0.18% per month (t = −1.62, −1.11, and −0.62) at the
1-, 6-, and 12-month horizons, respectively. The high-minus-low deciles on total volatility (Tv)
earn on average −0.4%, −0.25%, and −0.2% (t = −1.16, −0.77, and −0.62) at the three horizons,
respectively. The systematic volatility risk (Sv) is insignificant at the 6- and 12-month horizons
(Table 3), but significant at the 1-month with an average return of −0.53% (t = −2.47) (Table 4).
Our estimates are lower than −1.06%, −0.97%, and −1.04% per month (t = −3.1, −2.86 and
−3.9) for the high-minus-low Ivff, Tv, and Sv deciles, respectively, all at the 1-month horizon,
reported in Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006) based on NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints
and value-weights. With these breakpoints, we obtain −1.28% (t = −3.48) and −1.22% (t = 3)
for the high-minus-low Ivff and Tv deciles, respectively, in our sample. For the high-minus-low
Sv decile, we obtain −1.1% (t = −3.1) in the 1986–2000 sample in Ang et al., but only −0.56%
(t = −2.09) in our sample. In the 2001–2014 period, the Sv effect has disappeared, with an average
return of 0.01%. Our replication results are consistent with those reported in Bali and Cakici (2008).
Three market beta measures based on rolling window regressions, the Frazzini-Pedersen (2014)
method, and the Dimson (1979) method are all insignificant. In particular, the high-minus-low
Frazzini-Pedersen beta deciles earn around −0.2% per month at the 1-, 6-, and 12-month horizons,
and are all within one standard error from zero. Our evidence replicates the Frazzini-Pedersen
results that high beta stocks do not earn significantly higher average returns than low beta stocks.
Traditional liquidity measures fare poorly in our replication. The high-minus-low deciles on the
Amihud (2002) absolute return-to-volume (Ami) earn on average only 0.28% and 0.37% per month

18

(t = 1.31 and 1.73) at the 1- and 6-month horizons, respectively. At the 12-month horizon, the
average return is marginally significant, 0.42% (t = 1.99) (Table 4). In contrast, Amihud reports a
highly significant liquidity effect using cross-sectional regressions that weight microcaps heavily.
All five versions of the Acharya-Pedersen (2005) liquidity betas, including return-return (β ret ),
illiquidity-illiquidity (β lcc ), return-illiquidity (β lrc ), illiquidity-return (β lcr ), and net liquidity beta
(β net ), earn insignificant high-minus-low returns on average across all monthly horizons. The average returns range from −0.05% to 0.34% per month, and all except for that of β lcc at the 1-month
horizon (t = 1.54) are within 1.5 standard errors from zero. In contrast, Acharya and Pedersen
report significant pricing results for β ret and β net based on cross-sectional regressions.
Other insignificant liquidity variables include share turnover (Tur) and its coefficient of variation
(Cvt), the coefficient of variation for dollar trading volume (Cvd), share price (Pps), and prior 1-,
6-, and 12-month turnover-adjusted number of zero daily trading volume (Lm1 , Lm6 , and Lm1 2).
In particular, the average returns of the high-minus-low Tur deciles range from −0.1% to −0.15%,
all of which are within 0.6 standard errors from zero. In contrast, Datar, Naik, and Radcliffe (1998)
report highly significant pricing results for Tur in cross-sectional regressions. The average returns
of the high-minus-low Cvd deciles vary from 0.1% to 0.18%, all of which are within 1.3 standard
errors from zero. This evidence contrasts with Chordia, Subrahmanyam, and Anshuman (2001),
who again report highly significant results for Cvd with cross-sectional regressions. Finally, none
of the three Lm measures interacted with three holding periods (nine measures in total) produce
any significance. The high-minus-low average returns range from −0.07% to 0.38%, with t-values
from −0.33 to 1.82. In contrast, Liu (2006) reports significant average returns for eight out of the
nine measures using NYSE breakpoints but with equal-weighted returns.
The high-minus-low short-term reversal (Srev) decile earns on average only −0.26% per month
(t = −1.31). This estimate is much lower in magnitude than −1.99% (t = −12.55) reported in
Jegadeesh (1990) based on NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints and equal-weighted returns. The

19

high-minus-low high-low bid-ask spread (Shl) deciles earn on average −0.16%, −0.16%, and −0.12%
at the 1-, 6-, and 12-month horizons, which are all within 0.6 standard errors from zero. In contrast,
Corwin and Schultz (2012) report highly significant abnormal returns of more than 1% by weighting
decile returns based on prior-month returns, with weights closer to equal- than value-weights.
Several recently proposed friction variables are also insignificant. The high-minus-low tail risk
(Tail) deciles earn on average 0.11%, 0.15%, and 0.19% per month (t = 0.57, 0.79, and 1.13) at the
1-, 6-, and 12-month horizons, respectively. These estimates are lower than 0.36% (t = 2) at the
1-month and 0.35% (t = 2.15) at the 12-month horizon reported in Kelly and Jiang (2014) based on
NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints. The high-minus-low deciles on maximum daily return (Mdr)
earn on average −0.34%, −0.17%, and −0.07% (t = −1.14, −0.62, and −0.24) across the three horizons, respectively. These estimates are much lower in magnitude than −1.03% (t = −2.83) at the
1-month horizon reported in Bali, Cakici, and Whitelaw (2011) based on NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ
breakpoints. In particular, Bali et al. report that the average return starts at 1.01% for decile
one, remains roughly flat at decile seven, drops to 0.52% for decile nine, and then precipitously to
−0.02%. In our replication with NYSE breakpoints, the average return starts at 0.97% for decile
one, remains roughly flat at 1.05% for decile nine, and then drops only to 0.64%. Finally, the highminus-low decile on the Adrian-Etula-Muir (2014) leverage beta earns on average 0.43%, 0.3%, and
0.25% (t = 1.78, 1.31, and 1.15) at the 1-, 6-, and 12-month horizons, respectively.

3.3

Significant Anomalies

Turning to significant anomalies, Table 4 shows that their magnitudes are often much lower than
those reported in the original articles. In particular, the high-minus-low deciles formed on abnormal returns around earnings announcements (Abr) earn on average 0.3% and 0.22% per month
across the 6- and 12-month horizons, which are lower than the buy-and-hold returns of 5.9% and
8.3% over the same horizons reported in Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok (1996), respectively. In
addition, the high-minus-low deciles on revisions in analysts’ earnings forecasts (Re) earn 0.54%

20

(t = 2.49) and 0.28% (t = 1.47, Table 3) at the 6- and 12-month horizons, which are lower than the
buy-and-hold returns of 7.7% and 9.7% over the same horizons reported in Chan et al., respectively.
The Jegadeesh-Titman (1993) momentum anomaly fares well in our replication. The highminus-low deciles on prior six-month returns (R6 ) earn on average 0.82% (t = 3.49) and 0.55%
(t = 2.9) at the 6- and 12-month horizons, respectively. However, even these estimates are smaller
than the estimates of 1.1% (t = 3.61) and 0.9% (t = 3.54), respectively, reported in Jegadeesh and
Titman based on NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints and equal-weighted returns.
The high-minus-low customer momentum (Cm) quintiles earn on average 0.79% (t = 3.74)
and 0.16% (t = 2.3) at the 1- and 12-month horizons, respectively.1 At the 6-month horizon, the
high-minus-low quintile earns 0.18% (t = 1.83) (Table 3). These estimates are substantially lower
than 1.58% (t = 3.79) reported in Cohen and Frazzini (2008) based on NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ
breakpoints as well as a $5 price screen (albeit with value-weighted returns).
The high-minus-low cash flow-to-price (Cp) decile earns on average 0.49% per month (t = 2.47).
This average return is much lower than 9.9% per annum reported in Lakonishok, Shleifer, and
Vishny (1994) based on NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints and equal-weighted returns. Relatedly,
sorting on operating cash flow-to-price (Ocp), yields an average high-minus-low return of 0.77% (t =
3.5). This estimate is much lower than 14.9% per annum (t = 2.65) reported in Desai, Rajgopal, and
Venkatachalam (2004) based on NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints and equal-weighted returns.
The high-minus-low asset growth (investment-to-assets, I/A) decile earns on average −0.46%
per month (t = −2.92). This average return is lower in magnitude than −1.05% (t = −5.04) with
value-weighted returns and −1.73% (t = −8.45) with equal-weighted returns reported by Cooper,
Gulen, and Schill (2008), who use NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ breakpoints. In addition, the high-minuslow operating accruals (Oa) decile earns only −0.27% (t = −2.13). This average return is much
smaller in magnitude than −10.4% per annum (t = −4.71) reported by Sloan (1996). Sloan uses

Following Cohen and Frazzini (2008), we form quintiles, not deciles, because a disproportionate number of firms
can have the same Cm values, giving rise to fewer than ten portfolios in some months.

Explaining Significant Anomalies with the q-factor Model

We use the q-factor model to explain significant anomalies in this section. In Section 4.1, we innovate
on the q-factors construction to extend their sample backward from 1972 to 1967. We discuss the
performance of the q-factor model in Section 4.2, and highlight its weaknesses in Section 4.3.

4.1

Extending the q-factors

Following Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015), we construct the size, investment, and Roe factors from
a triple 2 × 3 × 3 sort on size, investment-to-assets (I/A), and return on equity (Roe). Size is
the market equity, which is stock price per share times shares outstanding from CRSP, I/A is the
annual change in total assets (Compustat annual item AT) divided by one-year-lagged total assets,
and Roe is income before extraordinary items (Compustat quarterly item IBQ) divided by onequarter-lagged book equity.2 At the end of June of each year t, we use the median NYSE size to
split NYSE, Amex, and NASDAQ stocks into two groups, small and big. Independently, at the end
of June of year t, we break stocks into three I/A groups using the NYSE breakpoints for the low
30%, middle 40%, and high 30% of the ranked values of I/A for the fiscal year ending in calendar
year t − 1. Also, independently, at the beginning of each month, we sort all stocks into three groups
based on the NYSE breakpoints for the low 30%, middle 40%, and high 30% of the ranked values of
Roe. Earnings data in Compustat quarterly files are used in the months immediately after the most
recent public quarterly earnings announcement dates (item RDQ). For a firm to enter the factor
construction, we require the end of the fiscal quarter that corresponds to its announced earnings
to be within six months prior to the portfolio formation month.
2

Book equity is shareholders’ equity, plus balance sheet deferred taxes and investment tax credit (Compustat
quarterly item TXDITCQ) if available, minus the book value of preferred stock (item PSTKQ). Depending on
availability, we use stockholders’ equity (item SEQQ), or common equity (item CEQQ) plus the book value of
preferred stock, or total assets (item ATQ) minus total liabilities (item LTQ) in that order as shareholders’ equity.

22

Taking the intersection of the two size, three I/A, and three Roe groups, we form 18 benchmark
portfolios. Monthly value-weighted portfolio returns are calculated for the current month, and the
portfolios are rebalanced monthly. The size factor is the difference (small-minus-big), each month,
between the simple average of the returns on the nine small size portfolios and the simple average
of the returns on the nine big size portfolios. The investment factor is the difference (low-minushigh), each month, between the simple average of the returns on the six low I/A portfolios and
the simple average of the returns on the six high I/A portfolios. Finally, the Roe factor is the
difference (high-minus-low), each month, between the simple average of the returns on the six high
Roe portfolios and the simple average of the returns on the six low Roe portfolios.
Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015) start the q-factors sample in January 1972, restricted by the limited coverage of earnings announcement dates and book equity in Compustat quarterly files. We
extend the sample backward to January 1967. To overcome the lack of coverage for quarterly
earnings announcement dates, we use the most recent quarterly earnings from the fiscal quarter
ending at least four months prior to the portfolio formation month. To expand the coverage for
quarterly book equity, we use book equity from Compustat annual files and impute quarterly book
equity with clean surplus accounting. We first use quarterly book equity from Compustat quarterly
files whenever available, and then supplement the coverage for the fourth fiscal quarter with book
equity from Compustat annual files.3 If neither estimate is available, we apply the clean surplus
relation to impute the book equity. We first backward impute the beginning-of-quarter book equity
as the end-of-quarter book equity minus quarterly earnings plus quarterly dividends.4 Because we
impose a four-month lag between earnings and the holding period month (and the book equity in
3

Following Davis, Fama, and French (2000), we measure annual book equity as stockholders’ book equity, plus
balance sheet deferred taxes and investment tax credit (Compustat annual item TXDITC) if available, minus the
book value of preferred stock. Stockholders’ equity is the value reported by Compustat (item SEQ), if available.
Otherwise, we use the book value of common equity (item CEQ) plus the par value of preferred stock (item PSTK),
or the book value of assets (item AT) minus total liabilities (item LT). Depending on availability, we use redemption
value (item PSTKRV), liquidating (item PSTKL), or par value (item PSTK) for the book value of preferred stock.

Quarterly dividends are zero if dividends per share (item DVPSXQ) are zero. Otherwise, total dividends are
dividends per share times beginning-of-quarter shares outstanding adjusted for stock splits during the quarter.
Shares outstanding are from Compustat (quarterly item CSHOQ supplemented with annual item CSHO for fiscal
quarter four) or CRSP (item SHROUT), and the share adjustment factor is from Compustat (quarterly item AJEXQ
supplemented with annual item AJEX for fiscal quarter four) or CRSP (item CFACSHR).

the denominator of Roe is one-quarter-lagged relative to earnings), all the Compustat data in the
backward imputation are at least four-month lagged relative to the portfolio formation month.
If data are unavailable for the backward imputation, we impute the book equity for quarter
t forward based on book equity from prior quarters. Let BEQt−j , with 1 ≤ j ≤ 4, denote the
latest available quarterly book equity as of quarter t, and IBQt−j+1,t and DVQt−j+1,t be the sum of
quarterly earnings and quarterly dividends from quarter t−j+1 to t, respectively. BEQt can then be
imputed as BEQt−j +IBQt−j+1,t −DVQt−j+1,t . We do not use prior book equity from more than four
quarters ago to reduce imputation errors (1 ≤ j ≤ 4). We start the sample in January 1967 to ensure
that all the 18 benchmark portfolios from the triple sort on size, I/A, and Roe have at least ten firms.
From January 1967 to December 2014, the size, investment, and Roe factors in the q-factor
model earn on average 0.32%, 0.43%, and 0.56% per month (t = 2.42, 5.08, and 5.24), respectively.
The investment and Roe factor premiums cannot be explained by the Carhart (1997) four-factor
model, with alphas of 0.29% (t = 4.57) and 0.51% (t = 5.58), or the Fama-French (2015) five-factor
model, with alphas of 0.12% (t = 3.35) and 0.45% (t = 5.6), respectively. (The data for the Carhart
factors, including the momentum factor, UMD, and the five factors are from Kenneth French’s Web
site.) UMD earns an average return of 0.67% (t = 3.66), but its q-factor alpha is only 0.11% (t =
0.43). In the five-factor model, the average RMW and CMA returns are 0.27% (t = 2.58) and 0.34%
(t = 3.63), but their q-factor alphas are only 0.04% and 0.01% (t = 0.42 and 0.32), respectively.
Among the 18 benchmark portfolios underlying the q-factors, the small-low I/A-high Roe
portfolio earns the highest average excess return of 1.39% per month, and the small-high I/Alow Roe portfolio the lowest, −0.07%. The largest average return spread between the low and high
I/A portfolios, 0.74%, resides in the small-low Roe stocks. In contrast, the spread is only 0.09% in
the big-high Roe stocks. The largest average return spread between the high and low Roe portfolios,
1.1%, is in the small-high I/A stocks, and the spread is only 0.1% in the big-low I/A stocks.

4.2

The q-factor Regressions

For the q-factor model’s overall performance, Table 4 shows that across the 161 significant anomalies, the average magnitude of the high-minus-low alphas is 0.26% per month, and the number of
significant high-minus-low alphas is 46 at the 5% level and 11 with t ≥ 3. The mean absolute alpha
across all the deciles is 0.12%, and the number of rejections by the Gibbons, Ross, and Shanken
(1989, GRS) test is 107 at the 5% level and 72 at the 1% level.
Columns 1–37 in Table 4 report the q-factor alphas for the 37 significant momentum anomalies.
For the high-minus-low Sue decile at the 1-month horizon with an average return of 0.47% per month
(t = 3.42), the q-factor model has a tiny alpha of 0.05% (t = 0.4). For prior 6-month returns (R6 ) at
the 1-, 6-, and 12-month horizons, the high-minus-low average returns are 0.6%, 0.82%, and 0.55%
(t = 2.04, 3.49, and 2.9), and the q-factor alphas −0.04%, 0.24%, and 0.16% (t = −0.1, 0.78, and
0.75), respectively. From columns 1–37 in Table 5, the Roe factor is the main source of the model’s
performance. In total 35 high-minus-low deciles have positive Roe-factor loadings, and the two
negative loadings are tiny and insignificant. The average loading is 0.57. All but three of the positive
loadings are significant, including 28 with t-values above three. In particular, the high-minus-low
Sue decile at the 1-month has a large Roe-factor loading of 0.86 (t = 11.24). The investment-factor
loading is only −0.09 (t = −0.95). The high-minus-low R6 decile at the 6-month has an Roe-factor
loading of 0.99 (t = 5.33), and its investment-factor loading is tiny, −0.01 (t = −0.04).
Columns 38–68 in Table 4 report the q-factor alphas for the 31 significant value-versus-growth
anomalies. The high-minus-low book-to-market (Bm) decile earns an average return of 0.59% per
month (t = 2.84), and the q-factor alpha is 0.18% (t = 1.15). From Columns 38–68 in Table 5, the
investment factor is the main source of the model’s performance. All 31 high-minus-low deciles have
investment-factor loadings that go in the right direction in explaining average returns. The Roefactor loadings often go in the wrong direction, and 18 are significant, but the investment-factor
loadings dominate the Roe-factor loadings. In particular, the high-minus-low Bm decile has an

25

investment-factor loadings of 1.33 (t = 3.09) relative to an Roe-factor loading of −0.55 (t = −6.64).
Columns 69–95 in Table 4 report the q-factor alphas for the 27 significant investment anomalies.
The high-minus-low decile on composite equity issuance (Cei) earns an average return of −0.56%
(t = −3.16), and its q-factor alpha is −0.24% (t = −1.85). From Columns 69–95 in Table 5, the
investment factor is the main source of the model’s explanatory power. Most high-minus-low deciles
all have economically large and significantly negative loadings on the low-minus-high investment
factor. In contrast, the Roe-factor loadings have mixed signs. The Roe-factor loadings can occasionally be significantly positive, going in the wrong direction, but are dominated by the strong
investment-factor loadings. For example, the high-minus-low Cei decile has an investment-factor
loading of −1.04 (t = −13.74) relative to an Roe-factor loading of −0.12 (t = −1.57).
Columns 96–128 in Table 4 report the q-factor alphas for the 33 significant profitability anomalies. At the 1-, 6-, and 12-month horizons, the high-minus-low quarterly F-score (Fq ) decile earns
average returns of 0.58%, 0.53%, and 0.42% per month (t = 2.47, 2.52, and 2.22), and the q-factor
alphas are 0.13%, 0.15%, and 0.07% (t = 0.58, 0.86, and 0.49), respectively. From columns 96–128
in Table 5, the Roe factor is the main source of the model’s performance. All but one Roe-factor
loadings are highly significant, with the t-value magnitudes above five, and the average magnitude
of the loadings is 0.73. For example, at the 1-, 6-, and 12-month, the high-minus-low Fq decile have
Roe-factor loadings of 0.73, 0.67, and 0.65 (t = 6.97, 6.9, and 7.11), respectively. Their investmentfactor loadings are also significantly positive, but are dominated by the Roe-factor loadings.
Columns 129–154 in Table 4 report the q-factor alphas for the 26 significant intangibles anomalies, and the remaining columns report seven significant trading frictions anomalies. A combination
of the investment- and Roe-factor loadings helps the model’s performance (Table 5).

4.3

The Weaknesses of the q-factor Model

In this subsection, we highlight the anomalies that the q-factor model cannot explain. We first
detail the individual q-anomalies, and then explore their potential commonality.
26

4.3.1

Individual q-anomalies

From Table 4, nine momentum anomalies have significant q-factor alphas, including two with t ≥ 3.
The high-minus-low deciles on abnormal returns around earnings announcements (Abr) at the 1-,
6-, and 12-month earn on average 0.74%, 0.3%, and 0.22% per month (t = 5.85, 3.24, and 2.84),
and their q-factor alphas are 0.66%, 0.27%, and 0.23% (t = 4.49, 2.41, and 2.65), respectively.
Their Roe-factor loadings are economically weak, ranging only from 0.16 to 0.26, albeit significant
(Table 5). In addition, the high-minus-low decile on industry lead-lag effect in prior returns (Ilr)
earns 0.74% (t = 3.61) at the 1-month horizon, and its q-alphas is 0.79% (t = 3.15). The culprit
is an extremely weak Roe-factor loading, 0.08 (t = 0.59). Large q-factor alphas also show up in
the high-minus-low deciles on change in analysts’ forecasts (dEf), supplier industries momentum
(Sim), customer momentum (Cm), and customer industries momentum (Cim), all at the 1-month
horizon. Their q-factor alphas are 0.64%, 0.61%, 0.72%, and 0.64% (t = 2.81, 2.18, 2.75, and 2.29).
Weak Roe-factor loadings are again to blame.
Six value-versus-growth anomalies have significant q-factor alphas, but none with t ≥ 3. At the
1-, 6-, and 12-month, the average returns of the high-minus-low cash flow-to-price (Cpq ) deciles
are 0.69%, 0.55%, and 0.45% per month (t = 3.25, 2.77, and 2.44), and their q-factor alphas are
0.5%, 0.38%, and 0.22% (t = 2.27, 1.98, and 1.24), respectively. The strongly negative Roe-factor
loadings, which go in the wrong direction, hurt the q-factor model. At the 1-, 6-, and 12-month,
these loadings are −0.61, −0.56, and −0.45 (t = −4.3, −4.7, and −4.16), despite their strong
investment-factor loadings of 0.99, 0.97,and 1.01 (t = 6.12, 6.74, and 7.57), respectively.
Seven investment anomalies have significant q-factor alphas, and three with t ≥ 3. The qfactor model cannot explain the operating accruals (Oa) anomaly. The high-minus-low average
return is −0.27% per month (t = −2.13), and the q-factor alpha is −0.54% (t = −3.77). The
investment-factor loadings is tiny, −0.02 (t = −0.23). In contrast, the Roe-factor loading is large
and significant, 0.26 (t = 4.13), which goes in the wrong direction. The problem deepens with dis-

27

cretionary accruals (Dac), which purge the sales change and property, plant, and equipment from
Oa. The high-minus-low Dac decile earns an average return of −0.36% (t = −2.73), but the q-factor
alpha is −0.64% (t = −4.37). Both investment- and Roe-factor loadings go in the wrong direction,
0.23 and 0.19 (t = 2.38 and 3.05), respectively. Three other accrual measures also cause problems
for the q-factor model, including net operating assets (Noa), change in net noncash working capital
(dWc), and change in net financial assets (dFin). The high-minus-low Noa, dWc, and dFin deciles
earn on average −0.4%, −0.41%, and 0.28% per month (t = −2.94, −3.13, and 2.31), and their
q-factor alphas are −0.41%, −0.48%, and 0.44% (t = −2.24, −3.43, and 2.94), respectively. Their
investment-factor loadings are insufficient to bring the q-factor alphas to insignificance.
Nine profitability anomalies have significant q-factor alphas, including three with t ≥ 3. The
high-minus-low cash-based operating profits-to-assets (Cop) decile earns on average 0.63% per
month (t = 3.44), and its q-factor alpha is 0.69% (t = 4.77). Scaling with lagged assets (Cla)
reduces the average return only slightly to 0.53% (t = 3.02), but the q-factor alpha is higher, 0.74%
(t = 4.89). Monthly sorts on Cla yield average returns of 0.49%, 0.48%, and 0.47% (t = 3.02, 3.45,
and 3.57) at the 1-, 6-, and 12-month, and q-factor alphas of 0.43%, 0.4%, and 0.46% (t = 2.69, 2.82,
and 3.56), respectively. The size-factor loadings all go in the wrong direction in explaining average
returns, and the investment-factor loadings too, but weakly. The Roe-factor loadings, all of which
are significantly positive, are not large enough to bring the q-factor alphas to insignificance.
Sorting on the four-quarter-change in return on equity (dRoe) yields a high-minus-low average
return of 0.76% per month (t = 5.43) at the 1-month horizon, and is slightly higher than that
from sorting on Roe, 0.69% (t = 3.07). The q-factor alpha for the high-minus-low dRoe decile is
0.34% (t = 2.29). The investment- and Roe-factor loadings, both of which are significant, go in
the right direction, but are not large enough to bring the q-factor alpha into insignificance. We
interpret the evidence as indicating earnings seasonality. The four-quarter-change in Roe controls
for seasonality, and likely better captures the underlying economic profitability than Roe itself.

28

The q-factor model leaves 11 intangible anomalies significant, including four with t ≥ 3. The
q-factor model cannot capture the R&D-to-market (Rdm) anomaly. In annual sorts, the highminus-low decile earns on average 0.68% per month (t = 2.58), and the q-factor alpha is 0.7%
(t = 2.89). In monthly sorts at the 1-, 6-, and 12-month, the high-minus-low deciles earn average
returns of 1.19%, 0.83%, and 0.83% (t = 2.93, 2.12, and 2.32) and q-factor alphas of 1.47%, 0.97%,
and 0.8% (t = 2.97, 2.73, and 2.8), respectively. The investment-factor loadings, most of which
are significant, go in the right direction in explaining average returns. However, the Roe-factor
loadings, all of which are economically large and statistically significant, go in the wrong direction.
The q-factor model also fails to capture the Heston-Sadka (2008) seasonality anomalies. At the
beginning of each month t, we split stocks into deciles based on various measures of past performance, including returns in month t−12 (Ra1 ), average returns across months t−24, t−36, t−48, and
[2,5]

t−60 (Ra

[6,10]

), average returns across months t−72, t−84, t−96, t−108, and t−120 (Ra
[11,15]

returns across months t−132, t−144, t−156, t−168, and t−180 (Ra
[16,20]

months t−192, t−204, t−216, t−228, and t−240 (Ra

), average

), and average returns across

). Monthly decile returns are calculated for

the current month t, and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t+1. The average
[2,5]

returns of the high-minus-low deciles on Ra1 , Ra

[6,10]

, Ra

[11,15]

, Ra

[16,20]

, and Ra

are 0.65%, 0.69%,

0.83%, 0.67%, and 0.56% per month (t = 3.23, 4, 4.91, 4.66, and 3.29), and the q-factor alphas
are 0.55%, 0.81%, 1.13%, 0.65%, and 0.64% (t = 2.48, 3.9, 4.88, 3.6, and 3.14), respectively. The
investment- and Roe-factor loadings are mostly small and insignificant.
Finally, four friction anomalies are significant in the q-factor model, including one with t ≥ 3.
The high-minus-low deciles on total skewness (Ts), idiosyncratic skewness per the three-factor
model (Isff), and idiosyncratic skewness per the q-factor model (Isq), earn on average 0.23%, 0.34%,
and 0.27% per month (t = 2.11, 3.5, and 2.88) at the 1-month, respectively. Their q-factor alphas
are all around 0.31%, with t-values from 2.64 to 3.01. Both q-factor loadings are close to zero.

29

4.3.2

Commonality in q-anomalies

To explore the potential commonality among the 46 significant q-anomalies, we calculate their pairwise cross-sectional rank correlations based on each anomaly variable’s NYSE percentile rankings.
Panel A of Table 6 shows average within-category and average cross-category rank correlations.
Our categorization of anomalies based on a priori economic arguments is consistent with statistical clustering. In particular, average within-category correlations are generally large, but average
cross-category correlations are close to zero. Panel B digs deeper by reporting average withincategory correlations for each individual q-anomaly. Except for intangibles, anomalies within each
category tend to be positively correlated. With a few exceptions such as Ile1, dRoe1, and Ami12,
the positive correlations tend to be high. For intangibles, however, the Heston-Sadka (2008) seasonality variables have correlations close to zero, both among themselves and with other intangible
variables. As a result, the average within-category correlation for intangibles is only 0.07.5
To evaluate the overall economic significance of the q-anomalies, we follow Stambaugh and Yu
(2016) to form a composite measure for each category of q-anomalies by equal-weighting a stock’s
NYSE percentile rankings across the q-anomalies within the category. Some anomalies within a
given category forecast returns with opposite signs. We adjust the signs of all anomalies within
the category to ensure a universally positive sign in forecasting returns. Also, some anomalies have
different sample starting points. We start with January 1967, and always use all available anomaly
variables at a given point of time in constructing a composite measure. We form deciles on the
composite measure for each category as well as by combining all 46 q-anomalies.
The q-factor model is far from perfect. The high-minus-low deciles on the composite measures for the momentum, value-versus-growth, investment, profitability, intangibles, and frictions categories earn on average 1.1%, 0.6%, 0.6%, 0.71%, 1.08%, and 0.14% per month (t =
5
We have experimented with principle component analysis for the 46 q-anomalies. Consistent with the cluster
analysis based on rank correlations, the first six principle components capture 15.3%, 12.9%, 7.8%, 5.4%, 4.9%,
and 4.6% (in total 51%) of the time series variation of the 46 high-minus-low returns, respectively. As such, the
q-anomalies tend to be relatively diffused, especially with the Heston-Sadka (2008) seasonality variables in the mix.

30

5.72, 2.94, 4.27, 4.17, 6.92, and 0.92), and their q-factor alphas are 0.86%, 0.41%, 0.69%, 0.58%,
0.85%, and 0.16% (t = 3.67, 2.09, 4.28, 4.11, 5.08, and 1.52), respectively. Curiously, combining the
four friction variables destroys their forecasting power. A potential reason is that the average return
spreads based on their individual sorts shrink quickly once calculated as the differences between
deciles two and nine. Taking the average across the rankings ends up adding more noise into the
sorts. In contrast, the low within-category correlations among intangibles imply independent forecasting power for individual intangible anomalies, and taking the average rankings aggregates over
the signals to produce a high average return spread. Finally, combining all 46 q-anomalies leads to
an average return spread of 1.66% (t = 10.28), and the q-factor alpha is 1.4% (t = 7.48).

5

Summary and Implications

We have attempted to replicate the entire published anomalies literature in finance and accounting
by compiling a largest-to-date data library that consists of 447 anomaly variables. After we control
for microcaps with NYSE breakpoints and value-weighted returns, 286 anomalies (64%) are insignificant at the conventional 5% level. Imposing the t-value cutoff of three increases the number of
insignificance further to 380 (85%). In the trading frictions category that contains mostly liquidity
variables, 95 out of 102 (93%) are insignificant at the 5% level. The distress anomaly is also virtually nonexistent in our replication. Even for significant anomalies, such as price momentum and
operating accruals, their magnitudes are often much lower than originally reported. Finally, out of
the 161 significant anomalies, the q-factor model leaves 115 alphas insignificant (150 with t < 3).
In all, our evidence suggests that capital markets are more efficient than previously reported.
How should we move forward in the anomalies literature? As noted, Ioannidis (2005) develops
an analytical model which predicts that results in a scientific field are more likely to be false when
the studies use smaller samples, when the effects are smaller in magnitude, when there are many
empirical but fewer theoretically predicted relations, when authors have greater flexibility in designs, variable definitions, and empirical specifications, when there exist greater financial and other
31

interest and publication biases, and when more independent teams are involved in a given field.
We apply this conceptual framework to discuss implications of our replication on future work.

5.1

Taking the Con out of the Anomalies Literature

First, on the flexibility in test designs, variable definitions, and empirical specifications, our replication shows widespread p-hacking, mainly by overweighting microcaps. Microcaps account for 61%
of the total number of NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ stocks, but only 3.3% of the total market capitalization. Microcaps have the highest equal-weighted average returns and the largest cross-sectional
deviations in returns and anomaly variables among microcaps, small stocks, and big stocks. Many
studies overweight microcaps via NYSE-Amex-NASDAQ (not NYSE) breakpoints, often also with
equal-weights, in portfolio sorts. Hundreds of studies use Fama-MacBeth (1973) cross-sectional
regressions of future returns on anomaly variables, which assign even higher weights to microcaps
than equal-weights in sorts. As such, most published anomaly profits are greatly exaggerated. We
recommend NYSE breakpoints and value-weights in sorts as the benchmark method, as evident in
the construction of all common factors. While alternative specifications are not technically wrong,
results from the benchmark method should always be presented in the spirit of Leamer (1983).
Second, on the sample size, most anomalies studies use the U.S.-centric CRSP-Compustat data.
Karolyi (2016) shows that only 16% of all empirical studies in the top four finance journals examine
non-U.S. markets, a percentage that is well below measures of their economic importance in the
world economy. We agree with Karolyi that large-scale investigations of the global data available in
Datastream and Worldscope are likely to raise the quality of the anomalies literature. These outof-sample investigations are especially valuable for anomalies that are highly significant, but seem
to lack a priori economic underpinnings, such as the Heston-Sadka (2008) seasonality anomalies.
Third, authors, referees, and editors should be keenly aware of the complex agency problems
that can arise from financial conflicts of interest and publication biases. Referees can be more
open to papers that take care in developing well grounded economic hypotheses, even though their
32

empirical findings might not be (that) significant. Without such a publication bias, authors would
most likely have fewer incentives to engage in p-hacking. When working with junior coauthors,
senior academics should be alert to potential conflicts of interest in that junior coauthors are more
likely to p-hack, perhaps due to tenure pressure (Brodeur, Lé, Sangnier, and Zylberberg 2016).

5.2

Taking Economic Theory Seriously

Perhaps most important, the credibility of the anomalies literature can improve via a closer connection with economic theory. Ioannidis (2005) emphasizes the importance of theoretical predictions.
Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2016, p. 7) also write: “A factor derived from a theory should have a lower
hurdle than a factor discovered from a purely empirical exercise. Economic theories are based on
a few economic principles and, as a result, there is less room for data mining.”
For decades, the anomalies literature is largely statistical in nature. Fama and French (1992)
reject the classic CAPM. The consumption CAPM often performs even worse than the CAPM, and
is rarely used in the anomalies literature. In response to this theoretical vacuum, Fama and French
(1993) form their three-factor model by augmenting the market factor with two characteristicsbased factors on size and book-to-market. However, the empirical nature of the additional factors
leaves their model vulnerable to the data mining critique. In contrast, the q-factor model is economically motivated from the first principle of real investment for individual firms. Our extensive
evidence on the relative successes and weaknesses of the q-factor model suggests several fruitful
directions for future research, all of which involve rich interactions between theory and empirics.
First, despite their economic motivation and t > 5 in our sample, the investment and Roe factors in the q-factor model are not entirely immune to data mining. For example, Linnainmaa and
Roberts (2016) show that the Fama-French (2015) operating profitability premium is insignificant
in the pre-Compustat sample (the Roe premium is not examined, probably due to the lack of quarterly earnings data). An effective way to address the lingering data mining doubt is to examine
global financial data, following Karolyi’s (2016) advice. Another way to proceed is to examine
33

alternative asset classes, such as corporate bonds, sovereign bonds, equity derivatives, real estate,
private equity, and currencies. Are investment and Roe priced in the returns of these alternative
assets? How does the q-factor model in these markets perform relative to their benchmark models?
Second, while the q-factor model is motivated from the first principle of real investment, the
connection between theory and empirics can be strengthened. A theoretical literature based on real
options and neoclassical investment models has been developing since the late 1990s, initially aiming
at explaining the value premium (Berk, Green, and Naik 1999; Carlson, Fisher, and Giammarino
2004; Zhang 2005). More recently, the literature has focused on explaining the failure of the
CAPM in capturing the value premium (Kogan and Papanikolaou 2013), as well as explaining
momentum and value simultaneously (Li 2016).

Can the investment and Roe premiums be

explained simultaneously in a quantitative investment model? What drives the comovement behind
the investment and Roe factors? What drives the cross-sectional heterogeneity in investment and
Roe? What explains the failure of the CAPM in capturing the two premiums? What drives the
broad explanatory power of the q-factor model in the cross section, including anomalies formed on
variables that are not directly related to investment and profitability? These theoretical questions
are important. After all, Stambaugh and Yu (2016) interpret their two factors as driven by
mispricing, despite being closely related to the q-factors. When more empirical work is futile, careful
theorizing can shed light on the risk-versus-mispricing debate, as in the case of the value premium.
Finally, for the 46 q-anomalies, we suspect that the main reason is a missing expected growth
factor in the q-factor model. In the multiperiod investment model, expected returns vary crosssectionally, depending on investment, Roe, and expected investment growth. Prior work shows that
the expected growth plays an important role in explaining earnings and price momentum as well as
their short-lived dynamics (Liu, Whited, and Zhang 2009; Liu and Zhang 2014). George, Hwang,
and Li (2016) show that the 52-week high variable better predicts future investment growth than
Roe. However, concerned with the lack of a reliable expected growth proxy (Chan, Karceski, and
Lakonishok 2003), Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015) opt to drop the expected growth factor, and use
34

only the two-period investment model to motivate the investment and Roe factors. This omission
likely matters because some of the q-anomaly variables might be better predictors of future growth
rates than Roe. Examples include abnormal returns around earnings announcements, industry
lead-lag in prior returns, four-quarter-change in Roe, cash-based operating profitability, and R&Dto-market. The omission is especially acute for R&D-to-market. R&D is expensed in the data. As
such, R&D expenses depress current Roe, but raise future Roe (and consequently, the expected
growth). Future work can explore the role of the expected growth in explaining the q-anomalies.

Table 2 : Value- and Equal-weight Average Monthly Returns, and Averages and Cross-sectional Standard Deviations of
Selected Anomaly Variables, January 1967 to December 2014, 576 Months
Pane A shows averages of monthly value- and equal-weighted average stock returns, and monthly cross-sectional standard deviations (std) of returns for all
stocks (Market) and for microcaps (Micro), small, big, and all but micro stocks. Panel A also reports the average number of stocks and the average percent
of the total market capitalization (market cap) in each size group each month. Panel B shows average monthly cross-sectional standard deviations of selected
anomaly variables. We assign stocks to size groups at the end of each June. Micro stocks are below the 20th percentile of NYSE market cap at the end of June,
small stocks are between the 20th and 50th percentiles, and big stocks are above the NYSE median. The anomaly variables are size (Me), book-to-market (Bm),
standardized unexpected earnings (Sue), prior six-month returns (R6 ), investment-to-assets (I/A), return on equity (Roe), net payout yield (Nop), operating
accruals (Oa), R&D-to-market (Rdm), and cash-based operating profits-to-assets (Cop). Appendix A details variable definitions.

Table 3 : Anomalies That Cannot Be Replicated at the 5% Significance Level, January 1967
to December 2014, 576 Months
Insignificant anomalies are defined as those with the average returns of their high-minus-low deciles insignificant
at the 5% level. For each insignificant anomaly, this table reports the average return (m) and its t-statistics for
the high-minus-low decile. The t-statistics are adjusted for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelations. The number in
parentheses in the title of each panel denotes the number insignificant anomalies in the category of anomalies in
question. Table 1 describes the symbols. Appendix A details variable definitions and portfolio construction.

Table 4 : Explaining Significant Anomalies with the q-factor model, January 1967 to
December 2014, 576 Months
For each high-minus-low decile, m and αq are the average return and the q-factor alpha, and tm and tq are their
t-statistics adjusted for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelations, respectively. |αq | is the mean absolute alpha from
the q-factor model across a given set of deciles, and pq is the p-value (in percent) of the GRS test on the null that
the alphas across the deciles are jointly zero in the q-factor model. Table 1 describes the symbols, and Appendix A
details variable definitions and portfolio construction.

Table 5 : Factor Loadings for the q-factor Model, Significant Anomalies, January 1967 to
December 2014, 576 Months
For each high-minus-low decile, β MKT , β ME , β I/A , and β ROE are the loadings on the market, size, investment, and
ROE factors, respectively, and tβMKT , tβME , tβI/A , and tβROE are their t-statistics adjusted for heteroscedasticity and
autocorrelations. Table 1 describes the symbols. Appendix A details variable definition and portfolio construction.

Table 6 : Pairwise Cross-sectional Rank Correlations for q-anomailes, January 1967 to December 2014, 576 Months
The six categories of anomalies, including momentum, value-versus-growth, investment, profitability, intangibles, and trading frictions are denoted by Mom,
VvG, Inv, Prof, Intan, and Fric, respectively. Rank correlations are calculated with each anomaly variable’s NYSE percentile rankings in the cross section. Panel
A reports average within-category correlations, which are averaged across all the pairwise rank correlations within a category, as well as average cross-category
rank correlations, which are averaged across all possible pairwise ranking correlations across a given pair of categories. Panel B shows average within-category
rank correlations for each q-anomaly. Table 1 describes the symbols, and Appendix A details variable definitions.

Variable Definition and Portfolio Construction

When forming testing deciles, we always use NYSE breakpoints and value-weight decile returns.

A.1
A.1.1

Momentum
Sue1, Sue6, and Sue12, Standardized Unexpected Earnings

Per Foster, Olsen, and Shevlin (1984), Sue denotes Standardized Unexpected Earnings, and is calculated as the change in split-adjusted quarterly earnings per share (Compustat quarterly item
EPSPXQ divided by item AJEXQ) from its value four quarters ago divided by the standard deviation of this change in quarterly earnings over the prior eight quarters (six quarters minimum). At
the beginning of each month t, we split all NYSE, Amex, and NASDAQ stocks into deciles based
on their most recent past Sue. Before 1972, we use the most recent Sue computed with quarterly
earnings from fiscal quarters ending at least four months prior to the portfolio formation. Starting
from 1972, we use Sue computed with quarterly earnings from the most recent quarterly earnings
announcement dates (Compustat quarterly item RDQ). For a firm to enter our portfolio formation,
we require the end of the fiscal quarter that corresponds to its most recent Sue to be within six
months prior to the portfolio formation. We do so to exclude stale information on earnings. To avoid
potentially erroneous records, we also require the earnings announcement date to be after the corresponding fiscal quarter end. Monthly portfolio returns are calculated, separately, for the current
month t (Sue1), from month t to t+5 (Sue6), and from month t to t+11 (Sue12). The holding period
that is longer than one month as in, for instance, Sue6, means that for a given decile in each month
there exist six sub-deciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month period. We take the simple average of the sub-decile returns as the monthly return of the Sue6 decile.
A.1.2

Abr1, Abr6, and Abr12, Cumulative Abnormal Returns Around Earnings
Announcement Dates

We calculate cumulative abnormal stock return (Abr) around the latest quarterly earnings announcement date (Compustat quarterly item RDQ) (Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok 1996)):
Abri =

+1
X

rid − rmd ,

(A1)

d=−2

in which rid is stock i’s return on day d (with the earnings announced on day 0) and rmd is the
market index return. We cumulate returns until one (trading) day after the announcement date to
account for the one-day-delayed reaction to earnings news. rmd is the value-weighted market return
for the Abr deciles with NYSE breakpoints and value-weighted returns, but is the equal-weighted
market return with all-but-micro breakpoints and equal-weighted returns.
At the beginning of each month t, we split all stocks into deciles based on their most recent
past Abr. For a firm to enter our portfolio formation, we require the end of the fiscal quarter that
corresponds to its most recent Abr to be within six months prior to the portfolio formation. We do
so to exclude stale information on earnings. To avoid potentially erroneous records, we also require
the earnings announcement date to be after the corresponding fiscal quarter end. Monthly decile
returns are calculated for the current month t (Abr1), and, separately, from month t to t + 5 (Abr6)
and from month t to t + 11 (Abr12). The deciles are rebalanced monthly. The six-month holding
period for Abr6 means that for a given decile in each month there exist six sub-deciles, each of
63

which is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month period. We take the simple average
of the sub-decile returns as the monthly return of the Abr6 decile. Because quarterly earnings
announcement dates are largely unavailable before 1972, the Abr portfolios start in January 1972.
A.1.3

Re1, Re6, and Re12, Revisions in Analyst Earnings Forecasts

Following Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok (1996), we measure earnings surprise as the revisions
in analysts’ forecasts of earnings obtained from the Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System (IBES).
Because analysts’ forecasts are not necessarily revised each month, we construct a six-month moving
average of past changes in analysts’ forecasts:
REit =

6
X
fit−τ − fit−τ −1
,
pit−τ −1
τ =1

(A2)

in which fit−τ is the consensus mean forecast (IBES unadjusted file, item MEANEST) issued in
month t − τ for firm i’s current fiscal year earnings (fiscal period indicator = 1), and pit−τ −1 is
the prior month’s share price (unadjusted file, item PRICE). We require both earnings forecasts
and share prices to be denominated in US dollars (currency code = USD). We also adjust for any
stock splits and require a minimum of four monthly forecast changes when constructing Re. At
the beginning of each month t, we split all stocks into deciles based on their Re. Monthly decile
returns are calculated for the current month t (Re1), and, separately, from month t to t + 5 (Re6)
and from month t to t + 11 (Re12). The deciles are rebalanced monthly. The six-month holding
period for Re6 means that for a given decile in each month there exist six sub-deciles, each of which
is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month period. We take the simple average of the
sub-decile returns as the monthly return of the Re6 decile. Because analyst forecast data start in
January 1976, the Re portfolios start in July 1976.
A.1.4

R6 1, R6 6, and R6 12, Prior Six-month Returns

At the beginning of each month t, we split all stocks into deciles based on their prior six-month
returns from month t − 7 to t − 2. Skipping month t − 1, we calculate monthly decile returns,
separately, for month t (R6 1), from month t to t + 5 (R6 6), and from month t to t + 11 (R6 12).
The deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period that is longer than
one month as in, for instance, R6 6, means that for a given decile in each month there exist six
sub-deciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month period. We take
the simple average of the sub-deciles returns as the monthly return of the R6 6 decile. We do not
impose a price screen to exclude stocks with prices per share below $5 as in Jegadeesh and Titman
(1993). These stocks are mostly microcaps. Value-weighting returns assigns only tiny weights to
these stocks, which in turn do not need to be excluded.
A.1.5

R11 1, R11 6, and R11 12, Prior 11-month Returns

We split all stocks into deciles at the beginning of each month t based on their prior 11-month
returns from month t − 12 to t − 2. Skipping month t − 1, we calculate monthly decile returns for
month t (R11 1), from month t to t + 5 (R11 6), and from month t to t + 11 (R11 12). All the deciles
are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period that is longer than one month
as in, for instance, R11 6, means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each
of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month period. We take the simple average
64

of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the R11 6 decile. Because we exclude financial
firms, these decile returns are different from those posted on Kenneth French’s Web site.
A.1.6

Im1, Im6, and Im12, Industry Momentum

We start with the FF 49-industry classifications. Excluding financial firms from the sample leaves
45 industries. At the beginning of each month t, we sort industries based on their prior six-month
value-weighted returns from t−6 to t−1. Following Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999), we do not skip
month t − 1. We form nine portfolios (9 × 5 = 45), each of which contains five different industries.
We define the return of a given portfolio as the simple average of the five industry returns within
the portfolio. We calculate portfolio returns for the nine portfolios for the current month t (Im1),
from month t to t + 5 (Im6), and from month t to t + 11 (Im12). The portfolios are rebalanced
at the beginning of t + 1. The holding period that is longer than one month as in, for instance,
Im6, means that for a given portfolio in each month there exist six subportfolios, each of which
is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month period. We take the simple average of the
subportfolio returns as the monthly return of the Im6 portfolio.
A.1.7

Rs1, Rs6, and Rs12, Revenue Surprises

Following Jegadeesh and Livnat (2006), we measure revenue surprises (Rs) as changes in revenue per
share (Compustat quarterly item SALEQ/(item CSHPRQ times item AJEXQ)) from its value four
quarters ago divided by the standard deviation of this change in quarterly revenue per share over the
prior eight quarters (six quarters minimum). At the beginning of each month t, we split stocks into
deciles based on their most recent past Rs. Before 1972, we use the most recent Rs computed with
quarterly revenue from fiscal quarters ending at least four months prior to the portfolio formation.
Starting from 1972, we use Rs computed with quarterly revenue from the most recent quarterly
earnings announcement dates (Compustat quarterly item RDQ). Jegadeesh and Livnat find that
quarterly revenue data are generally available when earnings are announced. For a firm to enter
the portfolio formation, we require the end of the fiscal quarter that corresponds to its most recent
Rs to be within six months prior to the portfolio formation. This restriction is imposed to exclude
stale revenue information. To avoid potentially erroneous records, we also require the earnings
announcement date to be after the corresponding fiscal quarter end. Monthly deciles returns are
calculated for the current month t (Rs1), from month t to t + 5 (Rs6), and from month t to t + 11
(Rs12). The deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period that is
longer than one month as in, for instance, Rs6, means that for a given decile in each month there
exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month period.
We take the simple average of the subdeciles returns as the monthly return of the Rs6 decile.
A.1.8

Tes1, Tes6, and Tes12, Tax Expense Surprises

Following Thomas and Zhang (2011), we measure tax expense surprises (Tes) as changes in tax
expense, which is tax expense per share (Compustat quarterly item TXTQ/(item CSHPRQ times
item AJEXQ)) in quarter q minus tax expense per share in quarter q − 4, scaled by assets per
share (item ATQ/(item CSHPRQ times item AJEXQ)) in quarter q − 4. At the beginning of each
month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on their Tes calculated with Compustat quarterly data
items from at least four months ago. We exclude firms with zero Tes (most of these firms pay no
taxes). We calculate decile returns the current month t (Tes1), from month t to t + 5 (Tes6), and
from month t to t + 11 (Tes12). The deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The
65

holding period that is longer than one month as in, for instance, Tes6, means that for a given decile
in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior
six-month period. We take the simple average of the subdeciles returns as the monthly return of
the Tes6 decile. For sufficient data coverage, we start the sample in January 1976.
A.1.9

dEf1, dEf6, and dEf12, Changes in Analyst Earnings Forecasts

Following Hawkins, Chamberlin, and Daniel (1984), we define dEf ≡ (fit−1 − fit−2 )/(0.5 |fit−1 | +
0.5 |fit−2 |), in which fit−1 is the consensus mean forecast (IBES unadjusted file, item MEANEST)
issued in month t − 1 for firm i’s current fiscal year earnings (fiscal period indicator = 1). We
require earnings forecasts to be denominated in US dollars (currency code = USD). We also adjust
for any stock splits between months t − 2 and t − 1 when constructing dEf. At the beginning of each
month t, we sort stocks into deciles on the prior month dEf, and calculate returns for the current
month t (dEf1), from month t to t + 5 (dEf6), and from month t to t + 11 (dEf12). The deciles
are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period longer than one month as in,
for instance, dEf6, means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of
which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take the simple average of the
subdecile returns as the monthly return of the dEf6 decile. Because analyst forecast data start in
January 1976, the dEf portfolios start in March 1976.
A.1.10

Nei1, Nei6, and Nei12, The Number of Quarters with Consecutive Earnings
Increase

We follow Barth, Elliott, and Finn (1999) and Green, Hand, and Zhang (2013) in measuring Nei as
the number of consecutive quarters (up to eight quarters) with an increase in earnings (Compustat
quarterly item IBQ) over the same quarter in the prior year. At the beginning of each month t, we
sort stocks into nine portfolios (with Nei = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 7, and 8, respectively) based on their most
recent past Nei. Before 1972, we use Nei computed with quarterly earnings from fiscal quarters ending at least four months prior to the portfolio formation. Starting from 1972, we use Nei computed
with earnings from the most recent quarterly earnings announcement dates (Compustat quarterly
item RDQ). For a firm to enter the portfolio formation, we require the end of the fiscal quarter
that corresponds to its most recent Nei to be within six months prior to the portfolio formation.
This restriction is imposed to exclude stale earnings information. To avoid potentially erroneous
records, we also require the earnings announcement date to be after the corresponding fiscal quarter
end. We calculate monthly portfolio returns for the current month t (Nei1), from month t to t + 5
(Nei6), and from month t to t + 11 (Nei12). The deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month
t + 1. The holding period that is longer than one month as in, for instance, Nei6, means that for a
given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month
in the prior six-month period. We take the simple average of the subdeciles returns as the monthly
return of the Nei6 decile. For sufficient data coverage, the Nei portfolios start in January 1969.
A.1.11

52w1, 52w6, and 52w12, 52-week High

At the beginning of each month t, we split stocks into deciles based on 52w, which is the ratio
of its split-adjusted price per share at the end of month t − 1 to its highest (daily) split-adjusted
price per share during the 12-month period ending on the last day of month t − 1. Monthly decile
returns are calculated for the current month t (52w1), from month t to t + 5 (52w6), and from
month t to t + 11 (52w12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The
66

holding period longer than one month as in 52w6 means that for a given decile in each month there
exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take
the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the 52w6 decile. Because a
disproportionately large number of stocks can reach the 52-week high at the same time and have
52w equal to one, we use only 52w smaller than one to form the portfolio breakpoints. Doing so
helps avoid missing portfolio observations.
A.1.12

ǫ6 1, ǫ6 6, and ǫ6 12, Six-month Residual Momentum

We split all stocks into deciles at the beginning of each month t based on their prior six-month
average residual returns from month t − 7 to t − 2 scaled by their standard deviation over the same
period. Skipping month t − 1, we calculate monthly decile returns for month t (ǫ6 1), from month t
to t + 5 (ǫ6 6), and from month t to t + 11 (ǫ6 12). Residual returns are estimated each month for all
stocks over the prior 36 months from month t−36 to month t−1 from regressing stock excess returns
on the Fama-French three factors. To reduce the noisiness of the estimation, we require returns to
be available for all prior 36 months. All the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1.
The holding period that is longer than 1 month as in ǫ6 6 means that for a given decile in each
month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month
period. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the ǫ6 6 decile.
A.1.13

ǫ11 1, ǫ11 6, and ǫ11 12, 11-month Residual Momentum

We split all stocks into deciles at the beginning of each month t based on their prior 11-month
residual returns from month t − 12 to t − 2 scaled by their standard deviation over the same period.
Skipping month t − 1, we calculate monthly decile returns for month t (ǫ11 1), from month t to t + 5
(ǫ11 6), and from month t to t + 11 (ǫ11 12). Residual returns are estimated each month for all stocks
over the prior 36 months from month t − 36 to month t − 1 from regressing stock excess returns on
the Fama-French three factors. To reduce the noisiness of the estimation, we require returns to be
available for all prior 36 months. All the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1.
The holding period that is longer than 1 month as in ǫ11 6 means that for a given decile in each
month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month
period. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the ǫ11 6 decile.
A.1.14

Sm1, Sm6, and Sm12, Segment Momentum

Following Cohen and Lou (2012), we extract firms’ segment accounting and financial information
from Compustat segment files. Industries are based on two-digit SIC codes. Standalone firms are
those that operate in only one industry with segment sales, reported in Compustat segment files,
accounting for more than 80% of total sales reported in Compustat annual files. Conglomerate
firms are those that operating in more than one industry with aggregate sales from all reported
segments accounting for more than 80% of total sales.
At the end of June of each year, we form a pseudo-conglomerate for each conglomerate firm. The
pseudo-conglomerate is a portfolio of the conglomerate’s industry segments constructed with solely
the standalone firms in each industry. The segment portfolios (value-weighted across standalone
firms) are then weighted by the percentage of sales contributed by each industry segment within the
conglomerate. At the beginning of each month t (starting in July), using segment information form
the previous fiscal year, we sort all conglomerate firms into deciles based on the returns of their

67

pseudo-conglomerate portfolios in month t − 1. Monthly deciles are calculated for month t (Sm1),
from month t to t+5 (Sm6), and from month t to t+11 (Sm12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the
beginning of month t+1. The holding period that is longer than one month as in Sm6 means that for
a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month
in the prior six-month period. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Sm6 decile. Because the segment data start in 1976, the Sm portfolios start in July 1977.
A.1.15

Ilr1, Ilr6, Ilr12, Ile1, Ile6, Ile12, Industry Lead-lag Effect in Prior Returns
(Earnings Surprises)

We start with the Fama-French (1997) 49-industry classifications. Excluding financial firms from
the sample leaves 45 industries. At the beginning of each month t, we sort industries based on the
month t − 1 value-weighted return of the portfolio consisting of the 30% biggest (market equity)
firms within a given industry. We form nine portfolios (9 × 5 = 45), each of which contains five
different industries. We define the return of a given portfolio as the simple average of the five
value-weighted industry returns within the portfolio. The nine portfolio returns are calculated for
the current month t (Ilr1), from month t to t + 5 (Ilr6), and from month t to t + 11 (Ilr12), and
the portfolios are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period that is longer
than one month as in, for instance, Ilr6, means that for a given portfolio in each month there exist
six subportfolios, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month period. We
take the simple average of the subportfolio returns as the monthly return of the Ilr6 portfolio.
We calculate Standardized Unexpected Earnings, Sue, as the change in split-adjusted quarterly
earnings per share (Compustat quarterly item EPSPXQ divided by item AJEXQ) from its value
four quarters ago divided by the standard deviation of this change in quarterly earnings over the
prior eight quarters (six quarters minimum). At the beginning of each month t, we sort industries
based on their most recent Sue averaged across the 30% biggest firms within a given industry.6 To
mitigate the impact of outliers, we winsorize Sue at the 1st and 99th percentiles of its distribution
each month. We form nine portfolios (9 × 5 = 45), each of which contains five different industries.
We define the return of a given portfolio as the simple average of the five value-weighted industry
returns within the portfolio. The nine portfolio returns are calculated for the current month t
(Ile1), from month t to t + 5 (Ile6), and from month t to t + 11 (Ile12), and the portfolios are
rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period that is longer than one month as
in, for instance, Ile6, means that for a given portfolio in each month there exist six subportfolios,
each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month period. We take the simple
average of the subportfolio returns as the monthly return of the Ile6 portfolio.
A.1.16

Cm1, Cm6, and Cm12, Customer Momentum

Following Cohen and Frazzini (2008), we extract firms’ principal customers from Compustat segment files. For each firm we determine whether the customer is another company listed on the
CRSP/Compustat tape, and we assign it the corresponding CRSP permno number. At the end
of June of each year t, we form a customer portfolio for each firm with identifiable firm-customer
6

Before 1972, we use the most recent Sue with earnings from fiscal quarters ending at least four months prior
to the portfolio month. Starting from 1972, we use Sue with earnings from the most recent quarterly earnings
announcement dates (Compustat quarterly item RDQ). For a firm to enter our portfolio formation, we require the
end of the fiscal quarter that corresponds to its most recent Sue to be within six months prior to the portfolio month.
We also require the earnings announcement date to be after the corresponding fiscal quarter end.

68

relations for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. For firms with multiple customer firms,
we form equal-weighted customer portfolios. The customer portfolio returns are calculated from
July of year t to June of t + 1, and the portfolios are rebalanced in June.
At the beginning of each month t, we sort all stocks into quintiles based on their customer
portfolio returns, Cm, in month t − 1. We do not form deciles because a disproportionate number
of firms can have the same Cm, which leads to fewer than ten portfolios in some months. Monthly
quintile returns are calculated for month t (Cm1), from month t to t + 5 (Cm6), and from month
t to t + 11 (Cm12), and the quintiles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding
period that is longer than one month as in Cm6 means that for a given quintile in each month there
exist six subquintiles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month period.
We take the simple average of the subquintile returns as the monthly return of the Cm6 quintile.
For sufficient data coverage, we start the Cm portfolios in July 1979.
A.1.17

Sim1, Sim6, Sim12, Cim1, Cim6, and Cim12, Supplier (Customer) industries
Momentum

Following Menzly and Ozbas (2010), we use Benchmark Input-Output Accounts at the Bureau of
Economic Analysis (BEA) to identify supplier and customer industries for a given industry. BEA
Surveys are conducted roughly once every five years in 1958, 1963, 1967, 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987,
1992, 1997, 2002, and 2007. We delay the use of any data from a given survey until the end of
the year in which the survey is publicly released during 1964, 1969, 1974, 1979, 1984, 1991, 1994,
1997, 2002, 2007, and 2013, respectively. The BEA industry classifications are based on SIC codes
in the surveys from 1958 to 1992 and based on NAICS codes afterwards. In the surveys from 1997
to 2007, we merge three separate industry accounts, 2301, 2302, and 2303 into a single account.
We also merge “Housing” (HS) and “Other Real Estate” (ORE) in the 2007 Survey. In the surveys from 1958 to 1992, we merge industry account pairs 1–2, 5–6, 9–10, 11–12, 20–21, and 33–34.
We also merge industry account pairs 22–23 and 44–45 in the 1987 and 1992 surveys. We drop
miscellaneous industry accounts related to government, import, and inventory adjustments.
At the end of June of each year t, we assign each stock to an BEA industry based on its reported SIC or NAICS code in Compustat (fiscal year ending in t-1) or CRSP (June of t). Monthly
value-weighted industry returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the industry
portfolios are rebalanced in June of t+1. For each industry, we further form two separate portfolios,
the suppliers portfolio and the customers portfolios. The share of an industry’s total purchases from
other industries is used to calculate the supplier industries portfolio returns, and the share of the industry’s total sales to other industries is used to calculate the customer industries portfolio returns.
At the beginning of each month t, we split industries into deciles based on the supplier portfolio
returns, Sim, and separately, on the customer portfolio returns, Cim, in month t−1. We then assign
the decile rankings of each industry to its member stocks. Monthly decile returns are calculated
for month t (Sim1 and Cim1), from month t to t + 5 (Sim6 and Cim6), and from month t to t + 11
(Sim12 and Cim12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding
period that is longer than one month as in Sim6 means that for a given decile in each month there
exist six subdeciles, each initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take the simple
average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Sim6 decile.

A.2.1

Value-versus-growth
Bm, Book-to-market Equity

At the end of June of each year t, we split stocks into deciles based on Bm, which is the book equity
for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1 divided by the market equity (from CRSP) at the
end of December of t − 1. For firms with more than one share class, we merge the market equity
for all share classes before computing Bm. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year
t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1. Following Davis, Fama, and
French (2000), we measure book equity as stockholders’ book equity, plus balance sheet deferred
taxes and investment tax credit (Compustat annual item TXDITC) if available, minus the book
value of preferred stock. Stockholders’ equity is the value reported by Compustat (item SEQ), if
it is available. If not, we measure stockholders’ equity as the book value of common equity (item
CEQ) plus the par value of preferred stock (item PSTK), or the book value of assets (item AT)
minus total liabilities (item LT). Depending on availability, we use redemption (item PSTKRV),
liquidating (item PSTKL), or par value (item PSTK) for the book value of preferred stock.
A.2.2

Bmj, Book-to-June-end Market Equity

Following Asness and Frazzini (2013), at the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles
based on Bmj, which is book equity per share for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1
divided by share price (from CRSP) at the end of June of t. We adjust for any stock splits between
the fiscal year end and the end of June. Book equity per share is book equity divided by the number of shares outstanding (Compustat annual item CSHO). Following Davis, Fama, and French
(2000), we measure book equity as stockholders’ book equity, plus balance sheet deferred taxes
and investment tax credit (item TXDITC) if available, minus the book value of preferred stock.
Stockholders’ equity is the value reported by Compustat (item SEQ), if it is available. If not, we
measure stockholders’ equity as the book value of common equity (item CEQ) plus the par value
of preferred stock (item PSTK), or the book value of assets (item AT) minus total liabilities (item
LT). Depending on availability, we use redemption (item PSTKRV), liquidating (item PSTKL), or
par value (item PSTK) for the book value of preferred stock. Monthly decile returns are calculated
from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.2.3

Bmq 1, Bmq 6, and Bmq 12, Quarterly Book-to-market Equity

At the beginning of each month t, we split stocks into deciles based on Bmq , which is the book equity for the latest fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago divided by the market equity (from
CRSP) at the end of month t − 1. For firms with more than one share class, we merge the market
equity for all share classes before computing Bmq . We calculate decile returns for the current month
t (Bmq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Bmq 6), and from month t to t + 11 (Bmq 12), and the deciles are
rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period longer than one month as in, for
instance, Bmq 6, means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which
is initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take the simple average of the subdecile
returns as the monthly return of the Bmq 6 decile. Book equity is shareholders’ equity, plus balance
sheet deferred taxes and investment tax credit (Compustat quarterly item TXDITCQ) if available,
minus the book value of preferred stock (item PSTKQ). Depending on availability, we use stockholders’ equity (item SEQQ), or common equity (item CEQQ) plus the book value of preferred stock,
or total assets (item ATQ) minus total liabilities (item LTQ) in that order as shareholders’ equity.

70

Before 1972, the sample coverage is limited for quarterly book equity in Compustat quarterly
files. We expand the coverage by using book equity from Compustat annual files as well as by
imputing quarterly book equity with clean surplus accounting. Specifically, whenever available we
first use quarterly book equity from Compustat quarterly files. We then supplement the coverage
for fiscal quarter four with annual book equity from Compustat annual files. Following Davis, Fama,
and French (2000), we measure annual book equity as stockholders’ book equity, plus balance sheet
deferred taxes and investment tax credit (Compustat annual item TXDITC) if available, minus
the book value of preferred stock. Stockholders’ equity is the value reported by Compustat (item
SEQ), if available. If not, stockholders’ equity is the book value of common equity (item CEQ) plus
the par value of preferred stock (item PSTK), or the book value of assets (item AT) minus total
liabilities (item LT). Depending on availability, we use redemption (item PSTKRV), liquidating
(item PSTKL), or par value (item PSTK) for the book value of preferred stock.
If both approaches are unavailable, we apply the clean surplus relation to impute the book equity. Specifically, we impute the book equity for quarter t forward based on book equity from prior
quarters. Let BEQt−j , 1 ≤ j ≤ 4 denote the latest available quarterly book equity as of quarter
t, and IBQt−j+1,t and DVQt−j+1,t be the sum of quarterly earnings and quarterly dividends from
quarter t−j +1 to t, respectively. BEQt can then be imputed as BEQt−j +IBQt−j+1,t −DVQt−j+1,t .
We do not use prior book equity from more than four quarters ago (i.e., 1 ≤ j ≤ 4) to reduce imputation errors. Quarterly earnings are income before extraordinary items (Compustat quarterly item
IBQ). Quarterly dividends are zero if dividends per share (item DVPSXQ) are zero. Otherwise,
total dividends are dividends per share times beginning-of-quarter shares outstanding adjusted for
stock splits during the quarter. Shares outstanding are from Compustat (quarterly item CSHOQ
supplemented with annual item CSHO for fiscal quarter four) or CRSP (item SHROUT), and the
share adjustment factor is from Compustat (quarterly item AJEXQ supplemented with annual item
AJEX for fiscal quarter four) or CRSP (item CFACSHR). Because we use quarterly book equity at
least four months after the fiscal quarter end, all the Compustat data used in the imputation are at
least four-month lagged prior to the portfolio formation. In addition, we do not impute quarterly
book equity backward using future earnings and book equity information to avoid look-ahead bias.
A.2.4

Dm, Debt-to-market

At the end of June of each year t, we split stocks into deciles based on debt-to-market, Dm, which
is total debt (Compustat annual item DLC plus DLTT) for the fiscal year ending in calendar year
t − 1 divided by the market equity (from CRSP) at the end of December of t − 1. For firms with
more than one share class, we merge the market equity for all share classes before computing Dm.
Firms with no debt are excluded. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June
of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.2.5

Dmq 1, Dmq 6, and Dmq 12, Quarterly Debt-to-market

At the beginning of each month t, we split stocks into deciles based on quarterly debt-to-market,
Dmq , which is total debt (Compustat quarterly item DLCQ plus item DLTTQ) for the latest fiscal
quarter ending at least four months ago divided by the market equity (from CRSP) at the end of
month t − 1. For firms with more than one share class, we merge the market equity for all share
classes before computing Dmq . Firms with no debt are excluded. We calculate decile returns for
the current month t (Dmq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Dmq 6), and from month t to t + 11 (Dmq 12),
and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period longer than
71

one month as in, for instance, Dmq 6, means that for a given decile in each month there exist six
subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take the
simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Dmq 6 decile. For sufficient
data coverage, the Dmq portfolios start in January 1972.
A.2.6

Am, Assets-to-market

At the end of June of each year t, we split stocks into deciles based on asset-to-market, Am, which is
total assets (Compustat annual item AT) for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1 divided by
the market equity (from CRSP) at the end of December of t−1. For firms with more than one share
class, we merge the market equity for all share classes before computing Am. Monthly decile returns
are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.2.7

Amq 1, Amq 6, and Amq 12, Quarterly assets-to-market

At the beginning of each month t, we split stocks into deciles based on quarterly asset-to-market,
Amq , which is total assets (Compustat quarterly item ATQ) for the latest fiscal quarter ending
at least four months ago divided by the market equity (from CRSP) at the end of month t − 1.
For firms with more than one share class, we merge the market equity for all share classes before
computing Amq . We calculate decile returns for the current month t (Amq 1), from month t to t + 5
(Amq 6), and from month t to t + 11 (Amq 12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of
month t + 1. The holding period longer than one month as in, for instance, Amq 6, means that for a
given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month
in the prior six months. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return
of the Amq 6 decile. For sufficient data coverage, the Amq portfolios start in January 1972.
A.2.8

Rev1, Rev6, and Rev12, Reversal

To capture the De Bondt and Thaler (1985) long-term reversal (Rev) effect, at the beginning of
each month t, we split stocks into deciles based on the prior returns from month t − 60 to t − 13.
Monthly decile returns are computed for the current month t (Rev1), from month t to t + 5 (Rev6),
and from month t to t + 11 (Rev12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of t + 1. The
holding period longer than one month as in, for instance, Rev6, means that for a given decile in
each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six
months. We take the simple average of the subdeciles returns as the monthly return of the Rev6
decile. To be included in a portfolio for month t, a stock must have a valid price at the end of
t − 61 and a valid return for t − 13. In addition, any missing returns from month t − 60 to t − 14
must be −99.0, which is the CRSP code for a missing ending price.
A.2.9

Ep, Earnings-to-price

At the end of June of each year t, we split stocks into deciles based on earnings-to-price, Ep, which
is income before extraordinary items (Compustat annual item IB) for the fiscal year ending in
calendar year t − 1 divided by the market equity (from CRSP) at the end of December of t − 1. For
firms with more than one share class, we merge the market equity for all share classes before computing Ep. Firms with non-positive earnings are excluded. Monthly decile returns are calculated
from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.

72

A.2.10

Epq 1, Epq 6, and Epq 12, Quarterly Earnings-to-price

At the beginning of each month t, we split stocks into deciles based on quarterly earnings-to-price,
Epq , which is income before extraordinary items (Compustat quarterly item IBQ) divided by the
market equity (from CRSP) at the end of month t − 1. Before 1972, we use quarterly earnings
from fiscal quarters ending at least four months prior to the portfolio formation. Starting from
1972, we use quarterly earnings from the most recent quarterly earnings announcement dates (item
RDQ). For a firm to enter the portfolio formation, we require the end of the fiscal quarter that
corresponds to its most recent quarterly earnings to be within six months prior to the portfolio
formation. This restriction is imposed to exclude stale earnings information. To avoid potentially
erroneous records, we also require the earnings announcement date to be after the corresponding
fiscal quarter end. Firms with non-positive earnings are excluded. For firms with more than one
share class, we merge the market equity for all share classes before computing Epq . We calculate
decile returns for the current month t (Epq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Epq 6), and from month t to
t + 11 (Epq 12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period
longer than one month as in, for instance, Epq 6, means that for a given decile in each month there
exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take
the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Epq 6 decile.
A.2.11

Efp1, Efp6, and Efp12, Earnings Forecast-to-price

Following Elgers, Lo, and Pfeiffer (2001), we define analysts’ earnings forecast-to-price, Efp, as the
consensus median forecasts (IBES unadjusted file, item MEDEST) for the current fiscal year (fiscal
period indicator = 1) divided by share price (unadjusted file, item PRICE). We require earnings
forecasts to be denominated in US dollars (currency code = USD). At the beginning of each month
t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Efp estimated with forecasts in month t − 1. Firms with
non-positive forecasts are excluded. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month t
(Efp1), from month t to t + 5 (Efp6), and from month t to t + 11 (Efp12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of t + 1. The holding period longer than one month as in, for instance, Efp6,
means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in
a different month in the prior six months. We take the simple average of the subdeciles returns as
the monthly return of the Efp6 decile. Because the earnings forecast data start in January 1976,
the Efp deciles start in February 1976.
A.2.12

Cp, Cash Flow-to-price

At the end of June of each year t, we split stocks into deciles based on cash flow-to-price, Cf, which
is cash flows for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1 divided by the market equity (from
CRSP) at the end of December of t − 1. Cash flows are income before extraordinary items (Compustat annual item IB) plus depreciation (item DP)). For firms with more than one share class, we
merge the market equity for all share classes before computing Cp. Firms with non-positive cash
flows are excluded. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and
the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.2.13

Cpq 1, Cpq 6, and Cpq 12, Quarterly Cash Flow-to-price

At the beginning of each month t, we split stocks into deciles based on quarterly cash flow-to-price,
Cpq , which is cash flows for the latest fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago divided by

73

the market equity (from CRSP) at the end of month t − 1. Quarterly cash flows are income before
extraordinary items (Compustat quarterly item IBQ) plus depreciation (item DPQ). For firms with
more than one share class, we merge the market equity for all share classes before computing Cpq .
Firms with non-positive cash flows are excluded. We calculate decile returns for the current month
t (Epq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Epq 6), and from month t to t + 11 (Epq 12), and the deciles are
rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period longer than one month as in,
for instance, Epq 6, means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of
which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take the simple average of the
subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Epq 6 decile.
A.2.14

Dp, Dividend Yield

At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on dividend yield, Dp, which is
the total dividends paid out from July of year t − 1 to June of t divided by the market equity (from
CRSP) at the end of June of t. We calculate monthly dividends as the begin-of-month market
equity times the difference between returns with and without dividends. Monthly dividends are
then accumulated from July of t − 1 to June of t. We exclude firms that do not pay dividends.
Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are
rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.2.15

Dpq 1, Dpq 6, and Dpq 12, Quarterly Dividend Yield

At the beginning of each month t, we split stocks into deciles on quarterly dividend yield, Dpq ,
which is the total dividends paid out from months t − 3 to t − 1 divided by the market equity (from
CRSP) at the end of month t − 1. We calculate monthly dividends as the begin-of-month market
equity times the difference between returns with and without dividends. Monthly dividends are then
accumulated from month t − 3 to t − 1. We exclude firms that do not pay dividends. We calculate
monthly decile returns for the current month t (Dpq 1), from month t to t+5 (Dpq 6), and from month
t to t + 11 (Dpq 12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding
period longer than one month as in, for instance, Dpq 6, means that for a given decile in each month
there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months.
We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Dpq 6 decile.
A.2.16

Op and Nop, (Net) Payout Yield

Per Boudoukh, Michaely, Richardson, and Roberts (2007), total payouts are dividends on common
stock (Compustat annual item DVC) plus repurchases. Repurchases are the total expenditure on
the purchase of common and preferred stocks (item PRSTKC) plus any reduction (negative change
over the prior year) in the value of the net number of preferred stocks outstanding (item PSTKRV).
Net payouts equal total payouts minus equity issuances, which are the sale of common and preferred
stock (item SSTK) minus any increase (positive change over the prior year) in the value of the net
number of preferred stocks outstanding (item PSTKRV). At the end of June of each year t, we sort
stocks into deciles based on total payouts (net payouts) for the fiscal year ending in calendar year
t − 1 divided by the market equity (from CRSP) at the end of December of t − 1 (Op and Nop,
respectively). For firms with more than one share class, we merge the market equity for all share
classes before computing Op and Nop. Firms with non-positive total payouts (zero net payouts)
are excluded. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the

74

deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1. Because the data on total expenditure and the sale of
common and preferred stocks start in 1971, the Op and Nop portfolios start in July 1972.
A.2.17

Opq 1, Opq 6, Opq 12, Nopq 1, Nopq 6, and Nopq 12, Quarterly (Net) Payout
Yield

Quarterly total payouts are dividends plus repurchases from the latest fiscal quarter. Quarterly
dividends are zero if dividends per share (Compustat quarterly item DVPSXQ) are zero. Otherwise, quarterly dividends are dividends per share times beginning-of-quarter shares outstanding
(item CSHOQ) adjusted for stock splits during the quarter (item AJEXQ for the adjustment factor).
Quarterly repurchases are the quarterly change in year-to-date expenditure on the purchase of common and preferred stocks (item PRSTKCY) plus any reduction (negative change in the prior quarter) in the book value of preferred stocks (item PSTKQ). Quarterly net payouts equal total payouts
minus equity issuances, which are the quarterly change in year-to-date sale of common and preferred
stock (item SSTKY) minus any increase (positive change over the prior quarter) in the book value
of preferred stocks (item PSTKQ). At the beginning of month t, we split stocks into deciles based on
quarterly payouts (net payouts) for the latest fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago, divided
by the market equity at the end of month t − 1 (Opq and Nopq , respectively). For firms with more
than one share class, we merge the market equity for all share classes before computing Opq and
Nopq . Firms with non-positive total payouts (zero net payouts) are excluded. We calculate monthly
decile returns for the current month t (Opq 1 and Nopq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Opq 6 and Nopq 6),
and from month t to t + 11 (Opq 12 and Nopq 12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of
month t + 1. The holding period longer than one month as in, for instance, Opq 6, means that for a
given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month
in the prior six months. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return
of the Opq 6 decile. For sufficient data coverage, the Opq and Nopq portfolios start in January 1985.
A.2.18

Sr, Five-year Sales Growth Rank

Following Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1994), we measure five-year sales growth rank, Sr, in
June
P5 of year t as the weighted average of the annual sales growth ranks for the prior five years:
j=1 (6 − j) × Rank(t − j). The sales growth for year t − j is the growth rate in sales (Compustat
annual item SALE) from the fiscal year ending in t − j − 1 to the fiscal year ending in t − j. Only
firms with data for all five prior years are used to determine the annual sales growth ranks, and we
exclude firms with non-positive sales. For each year from t − 5 to t − 1, we rank stocks into deciles
based on their annual sales growth, and then assign rank i (i = 1, . . . , 10) to a firm if its annual
sales growth falls into the ith decile. At the end of June of each year t, we assign stocks into deciles
based on Sr. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the
deciles are rebalanced at the end of June in year t + 1.
A.2.19

Sg, Sales Growth

At the end of June of each year t, we assign stocks into deciles based on Sg, which is the growth in annual sales (Compustat annual item SALE) from the fiscal year ending in calendar year t−2 to the fiscal year ending in t−1. Firms with non-positive sales are excluded. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t+1, and the deciles are rebalanced at the end of June in year t+1.

75

A.2.20

Em, Enterprise Multiple

Enterprise multiple, Em, is enterprise value divided by operating income before depreciation (Compustat annual item OIBDP). Enterprise value is the market equity plus the total debt (item DLC
plus item DLTT) plus the book value of preferred stocks (item PSTKRV) minus cash and shortterm investments (item CHE). At the end of June of each year t, we split stocks into deciles based
on Em for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t−1. The Market equity (from CRSP) is measured
at the end of December of t − 1. For firms with more than one share class, we merge the market
equity for all share classes before computing Em. Firms with negative enterprise value or operating
income before depreciation are excluded. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t
to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.2.21

Emq 1, Emq 6, and Emq 12, Quarterly Enterprise Multiple

Emq , is enterprise value scaled by operating income before depreciation (Compustat quarterly item
OIBDPQ). Enterprise value is the market equity plus total debt (item DLCQ plus item DLTTQ)
plus the book value of preferred stocks (item PSTKQ) minus cash and short-term investments (item
CHEQ). At the beginning of each month t, we split stocks into deciles on Emq for the latest fiscal
quarter ending at least four months ago. The Market equity (from CRSP) is measured at the end
of month t − 1. For firms with more than one share class, we merge the market equity for all share
classes before computing Emq . Firms with negative enterprise value or operating income before
depreciation are excluded. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month t (Emq 1),
from month t to t + 5 (Emq 6), and from month t to t + 11 (Emq 12), and the deciles are rebalanced
at the beginning of t + 1. The holding period longer than one month as in Emq 6 means that for
a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each initiated in a different month in the
prior six months. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the
Emq 6 decile. For sufficient data coverage, the EMq portfolios start in January 1975.
A.2.22

Sp, Sales-to-price

At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on sales-to-price, Sp, which
is sales (Compustat annual item SALE) for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1 divided
by the market equity (from CRSP) at the end of December of t − 1. For firms with more than
one share class, we merge the market equity for all share classes before computing Sp. Firms with
non-positive sales are excluded. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June
of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.2.23

Spq 1, Spq 6, and Spq 12, Quarterly Sales-to-price

At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on quarterly sales-to-price,
Spq , which is sales (Compustat quarterly item SALEQ) divided by the market equity at the end of
month t − 1. Before 1972, we use quarterly sales from fiscal quarters ending at least four months
prior to the portfolio formation. Starting from 1972, we use quarterly sales from the most recent
quarterly earnings announcement dates (item RDQ). Sales are generally announced with earnings
during quarterly earnings announcements (Jegadeesh and Livnat 2006). For a firm to enter the
portfolio formation, we require the end of the fiscal quarter that corresponds to its most recent
quarterly sales to be within six months prior to the portfolio formation. This restriction is imposed
to exclude stale earnings information. To avoid potentially erroneous records, we also require the

76

earnings announcement date to be after the corresponding fiscal quarter end. Firms with nonpositive sales are excluded. For firms with more than one share class, we merge the market equity
for all share classes before computing Spq . Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current
month t (Spq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Spq 6), and from month t to t + 11 (Spq 12), and the deciles
are rebalanced at the beginning of t + 1. The holding period longer than one month as in Spq 6
means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in
a different month in the prior six months. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as
the monthly return of the Spq 6 decile.
A.2.24

Ocp, Operating Cash Flow-to-price

At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on operating cash flows-to-price,
Ocp, which is operating cash flows for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1 divided by the
market equity (from CRSP) at the end of December of t − 1. Operating cash flows are measured
as funds from operation (Compustat annual item FOPT) minus change in working capital (item
WCAP) prior to 1988, and then as net cash flows from operating activities (item OANCF) stating
from 1988. For firms with more than one share class, we merge the market equity for all share classes
before computing Ocp. Firms with non-positive operating cash flows are excluded. Monthly decile
returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of
t + 1. Because the data on funds from operation start in 1971, the Ocp portfolios start in July 1972.
A.2.25

Ocpq 1, Ocpq 6, and Ocpq 12, Quarterly Operating Cash Flow-to-price

At the beginning of each month t, we split stocks on quarterly operating cash flow-to-price, Ocpq ,
which is operating cash flows for the latest fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago divided
by the market equity at the end of month t − 1. Operating cash flows are measured as the quarterly
change in year-to-date funds from operation (Compustat quarterly item FOPTY) minus change
in quarterly working capital (item WCAPQ) prior to 1988, and then as the quarterly change in
year-to-date net cash flows from operating activities (item OANCFY) stating from 1988. For firms
with more than one share class, we merge the market equity for all share classes before computing Ocpq . Firms with non-positive operating cash flows are excluded. Monthly decile returns are
calculated for the current month t (Ocpq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Ocpq 6), and from month t to
t + 11 (Ocpq 12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of t + 1. The holding period longer
than one month as in, for instance, Ocpq 6, means that for a given decile in each month there exist
six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take the
simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Ocpq 6 decile. Because the
data on year-to-date funds from operation start in 1984, the Ocpq portfolios start in January 1985.
A.2.26

Ir, Intangible Return

Following Daniel and Titman (2006), at the end of June of each year t, we perform the cross-sectional
regression of each firm’s past five-year log stock return on its five-year-lagged log book-to-market
and five-year log book return:
r(t − 5, t) = γ 0 + γ 1 bmt−5 + γ 2 r B (t − 5, t) + ut

(A3)

in which r(t − 5, t) is the past five-year log stock return from the end of year t − 6 to the end of t − 1,
bmt−5 is the five-year-lagged log book-to-market, and r B (t − 5, t) is the five-year log book return.
77

The five-year-lagged log book-to-market is computed as bmt−5 = log(Bt−5 /Mt−5 ), in which Bt−5
is the book equity for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 6 and Mt−5 is the market equity
(from CRSP) at the end of December of t − 6. For firms with more than one share class, we merge
the market equity for all share classes beforePcomputing bmt−5 . The five-year log book return is
computed as r B (t − 5, t) = log(Bt /Bt−5 ) + t−1
s=t−5 (rs − log(Ps /Ps−1 )), in which Bt is the book
equity for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1, rs is the stock return from the end of year
s − 1 to the end of year s, and Ps is the stock price per share at the end of year s. Following Davis,
Fama, and French (2000), we measure book equity as stockholders’ book equity, plus balance sheet
deferred taxes and investment tax credit (Compustat annual item TXDITC) if available, minus the
book value of preferred stock. Stockholders’ equity is the value reported by Compustat (item SEQ),
if it is available. If not, we measure stockholders’ equity as the book value of common equity (item
CEQ) plus the par value of preferred stock (item PSTK), or the book value of assets (item AT)
minus total liabilities (item LT). Depending on availability, we use redemption (item PSTKRV),
liquidating (item PSTKL), or par value (item PSTK) for the book value of preferred stock.
A firm’s intangible return, Ir, is defined as its residual from the annual cross-sectional regression. At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks based on Ir for the fiscal year ending in
calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and
the deciles are rebalanced in June of year t + 1.
A.2.27

Vhp and Vfp, (Analyst-based) Intrinsic Value-to-market

Following Frankel and Lee (1998), at the end of June of each year t, we implement the residual
income model to estimate the intrinsic value:
(Et [Roet+2 ] − r)
(Et [Roet+1 ] − r)
Bt +
Bt+1
(1 + r)
(1 + r)r
(Et [Roet+1 ] − r)
(Et [Roet+2 ] − r)
(Et [Roet+3 ] − r)
= Bt +
Bt +
Bt+1 +
Bt+2
2
(1 + r)
(1 + r)
(1 + r)2 r

Vht = Bt +

(A4)

Vf t

(A5)

in which Vht is the historical Roe-based intrinsic value and Vft is the analysts earnings forecastbased intrinsic value. Bt is the book equity (Compustat annual item CEQ) for the fiscal year
ending in calendar year t − 1. Future book equity is computed using the clean surplus accounting: Bt+1 = (1 + (1 − k)Et [Roet+1 ])Bt , and Bt+2 = (1 + (1 − k)Et [Roet+2 ])Bt+1 . Et [Roet+1 ] and
Et [Roet+2 ] are the return on equity expected for the current and next fiscal years. k is the dividend
payout ratio, measured as common stock dividends (item DVC) divided by earnings (item IBCOM)
for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t−1. For firms with negative earnings, we divide dividends
by 6% of average total assets (item AT). r is a constant discount rate of 12%. When estimating
Vht , we replace all Roe expectations with most recent Roet : Roet = Nit /[(Bt + Bt−1 )/2], in which
N it is earnings for the fiscal year ending in t − 1, and Bt and Bt−1 are the book equity from the
fiscal years ending in t − 1 and t − 2.
When estimating Vft , we use analyst earnings forecasts from IBES to construct Roe expectations. Let Fy1 and Fy2 be the one-year-ahead and two-year-ahead consensus mean forecasts (IBES
unadjusted file, item MEANEST; fiscal period indicator = 1 and 2) reported in June of year t. Let
s be the number of shares outstanding from IBES (unadjusted file, item SHOUT). When IBES
shares are not available, we use shares from CRSP (daily item SHROUT) on the IBES pricing date
(item PRDAYS) that corresponds to the IBES report. Then Et [Roet+1 ] = sFy1/[(Bt+1 + Bt )/2],
in which Bt+1 = (1 + s(1 − k)Fy1)Bt . Analogously, Et [Roet+2 ] = sFy2/[(Bt+2 + Bt+1 )/2], in which
78

Bt+2 = (1+s(1−k)Fy2)Bt+1 . Let Ltg denote the long-term earnings growth rate forecast from IBES
(item MEANEST; fiscal period indicator = 0). Then Et [Roet+3 ] = sFy2(1+Ltg)/[(Bt+3 +Bt+2 )/2],
in which Bt+3 = (1+s(1−k)Fy2(1+Ltg))Bt+2 . If Ltg is missing, we set Et [Roet+3 ] to be Et [Roet+2 ].
Firms are excluded if their expected Roe or dividend payout ratio is higher than 100%. We also
exclude firms with negative book equity.
At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles on the ratios of Vh and Vf scaled by
the market equity (from CRSP) at the end of December of t−1, denoted Vhp and Vfp, respectively.
For firms with more than one share class, we merge the market equity for all share classes before
computing intrinsic value-to-market. Firms with non-positive intrinsic value are excluded. Monthly
decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in
June of t + 1. Because analyst forecast data start in 1976, the Vfp deciles start in July 1977.
A.2.28

Ebp, Enterprise Book-to-price, and Ndp, Net Debt-to-price

Following Penman, Richardson, and Tuna (2007), we measure enterprise book-to-price, Ebp, as the
ratio of the book value of net operating assets (net debt plus book equity) to the market value of
net operating assets (net debt plus market equity). Net Debt-to-price, Ndp, is the ratio of net debt
to the market equity. Net debt is financial liabilities minus financial assets. We measure financial
liabilities as the sum of long-term debt (Compustat annual item DLTT), debt in current liabilities
(item DLC), carrying value of preferred stock (item PSTK), and preferred dividends in arrears
(item DVPA, zero if missing), less preferred treasury stock (item TSTKP, zero if missing). We
measure financial assets as cash and short-term investments (item CHE). Book equity is common
equity (item CEQ) plus any preferred treasury stock (item TSTKP, zero if missing) less any preferred dividends in arrears (item DVPA, zero if missing). Market equity is the number of common
shares outstanding times share price (from CRSP).
At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Ebp, and separately, on
Ndp, for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Market equity is measured at the end of
December of t − 1. For firms with more than one share class, we merge the market equity for all
share classes before computing Ebp and Ndp. When forming the Ebp portfolios, we exclude firms
with non-positive book or market value of net operating assets. For the Ndp portfolios, we exclude
firms with non-positive net debt. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June
of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.2.29

Ebpq 1, Ebpq 6, Ebpq 12, Ndpq 1, Ndpq 6, and Ndpq 12, Quarterly Enterprise
Book-to-price, Quarterly Net Debt-to-price

We measure quarterly enterprise book-to-price, Ebpq , as the ratio of the book value of net operating assets (net debt plus book equity) to the market value of net operating assets (net debt plus
market equity). Quarterly net debt-to-price, Ndpq , is the ratio of net debt to market equity. Net
debt is financial liabilities minus financial assets. Financial liabilities are the sum of long-term debt
(Compustat quarterly item DLTTQ), debt in current liabilities (item DLCQ), and the carrying
value of preferred stock (item PSTKQ). Financial assets are cash and short-term investments (item
CHEQ). Book equity is common equity (item CEQQ). Market equity is the number of common
shares outstanding times share price (from CRSP).
At the beginning of each month t, we split stocks into deciles based on Ebpq , and separately, on
Ndpq , for the latest fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago. Market equity is measured at
79

the end of month t − 1. For firms with more than one share class, we merge the market equity for
all share classes before computing Ebpq and Ndpq . When forming the Ebpq portfolios, we exclude
firms with non-positive book or market value of net operating assets. For the Ndpq portfolios, we
exclude firms with non-positive net debt. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current
month t (Ebpq 1 and Ndpq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Ebpq 6 and Ndpq 6), and from month t to t + 11
(Ebpq 12 and Ndpq 12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of t + 1. The holding period
longer than one month as in, for instance, Ebpq 6, means that for a given decile in each month
there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months.
We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Ebpq 6 decile. For
sufficient data coverage, the Ebpq and Ndpq portfolios start in January 1976.

Dur, Equity Duration

Following Dechow, Sloan, and Soliman (2004), we calculate firm-level equity duration, Dur, as:
Dur =

PT

t=1 t

P


× CDt /(1 + r)t
1 + r ME − Tt=1 CDt /(1 + r)t
+ T+
,
ME
r
ME

(A6)

in which CDt is the net cash distribution in year t, ME is market equity, T is the length of forecasting
period, and r is the cost of equity. Market equity is price per share times shares outstanding (Compustat annual item PRCC F times item CSHO). Net cash distribution, CDt = BEt−1 (ROEt − gt ),
in which BEt−1 is the book equity at the end of year t − 1, ROEt is return on equity in year t,
and gt is the book equity growth in t. Following Dechow et al., we use autoregressive processes
to forecast ROE and book equity growth in future years. We model ROE as a first-order autoregressive process with an autocorrelation coefficient of 0.57 and a long-run mean of 0.12, and the
growth in book equity as a first-order autoregressive process with an autocorrelation coefficient of
0.24 and a long-run mean of 0.06. For the starting year (t = 0), we measure ROE as income before
extraordinary items (item IB) divided by one-year lagged book equity (item CEQ), and the book
equity growth rate as the annual change in sales (item SALE). Nissim and Penman (2001) show
that past sales growth is a better indicator of future book equity growth than past book equity
growth. Finally, we use a forecasting period of T = 10 years and a cost of equity of r = 0.12. Firms
are excluded if book equity ever becomes negative during the forecasting period. At the end of
June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Dur constructed with data from the fiscal
year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to
June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.2.31

Ltg1, Ltg6, and Ltg12, Long-term Growth Forecasts

The long-term growth forecast, Ltg, is measured as the consensus median forecast of the long-term
earnings growth rate from IBES (item MEDEST, fiscal period indictor = 0). At the beginning of
each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Ltg reported in t − 1. Monthly decile returns
are calculated for the current month t (Ltg1), from month t to t + 5 (Ltg6), and from month t to
t + 11 (Ltg12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of t + 1. The holding period longer
than one month as in, for instance, Ltg6, means that for a given decile in each month there exist
six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take
the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Ltg6 decile. Because the
long-term growth forecasts data start in December 1981, the deciles start in January 1982.

Investment
Aci, Abnormal Corporate Investment

At the end of June of year t, we measure abnormal corporate investment, Aci, as
Cet−1 /[(Cet−2 + Cet−3 + Cet−4 )/3] − 1, in which Cet−j is capital expenditure (Compustat annual
item CAPX) scaled by sales (item SALE) for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − j. The
last three-year average capital expenditure is designed to project the benchmark investment in the
portfolio formation year. We exclude firms with sales less than ten million dollars. At the end of
June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Aci. Monthly decile returns are computed
from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.3.2

I/A, Investment-to-assets

At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on investment-to-assets, I/A,
which is measured as total assets (Compustat annual item AT) for the fiscal year ending in calendar
year t−1 divided by total assets for the fiscal year ending in t−2 minus one. Monthly decile returns
are computed from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.3.3

Iaq 1, Iaq 6, and Iaq 12, Quarterly Investment-to-assets

Quarterly investment-to-assets, Iaq , is defined as quarterly total assets (Compustat quarterly item
ATQ) divided by four-quarter-lagged total assets minus one. At the beginning of each month t, we
sort stocks into deciles based on Iaq for the latest fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago.
Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month t (Iaq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Iaq 6),
and from month t to t + 11 (Iaq 12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1.
The holding period longer than one month as in, for instance, Iaq 6, means that for a given decile in
each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six
months. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Iaq 6 decile.
A.3.4

dPia, Changes in PPE and Inventory-to-assets

Changes in PPE and Inventory-to-assets, dPia, is defined as the annual change in gross property,
plant, and equipment (Compustat annual item PPEGT) plus the annual change in inventory (item
INVT) scaled by one-year-lagged total assets (item AT). At the end of June of each year t, we sort
stocks into deciles based on dPia for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are computed from July of year t to June of t+1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t+1.
A.3.5

Noa and dNoa, (Changes in) Net Operating Assets

Following Hirshleifer, Hou, Teoh, and Zhang (2004), we measure net operating assets as operating
assets minus operating liabilities. Operating assets are total assets (Compustat annual item AT)
minus cash and short-term investment (item CHE). Operating liabilities are total assets minus
debt included in current liabilities (item DLC, zero if missing), minus long-term debt (item DLTT,
zero if missing), minus minority interests (item MIB, zero if missing), minus preferred stocks (item
PSTK, zero if missing), and minus common equity (item CEQ). Noa is net operating assets scalded
by one-year-lagged total assets. Changes in net operating assets, dNoa, is the annual change in net
operating assets scaled by one-year-lagged total assets. At the end of June of each year t, we sort
stocks into deciles based on Noa, and separately, on dNOA, for the fiscal year ending in calendar
81

year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are computed from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles
are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.3.6

dLno, Changes in Long-term Net Operating Assets

Following Fairfield, Whisenant, and Yohn (2003), we measure changes in long-term net operating
assets as the annual change in net property, plant, and equipment (Compustat item PPENT) plus
the change in intangibles (item INTAN) plus the change in other long-term assets (item AO) minus
the change in other long-term liabilities (item LO) and plus depreciation and amortization expense
(item DP). dLno is the change in long-term net operating assets scaled by the average of total
assets (item AT) from the current and prior years. At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks
into deciles based on dLno for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns
are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.3.7

Ig, Investment Growth

At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on investment growth, Ig,
which is the growth rate in capital expenditure (Compustat annual item CAPX) from the fiscal
year ending in calendar year t − 2 to the fiscal year ending in t − 1. Monthly decile returns are
calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.3.8

2Ig, Two-year Investment Growth

At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on two-year investment growth,
2Ig, which is the growth rate in capital expenditure (Compustat annual item CAPX) from the
fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 3 to the fiscal year ending in t − 1. Monthly decile returns
are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.3.9

3Ig, Three-year Investment Growth

At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on three-year investment growth,
3Ig, which is the growth rate in capital expenditure (Compustat annual item CAPX) from the fiscal
year ending in calendar year t − 4 to the fiscal year ending in t − 1. Monthly decile returns are
calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.3.10

Nsi, Net Stock Issues

At the end of June of year t, we measure net stock issues, Nsi, as the natural log of the ratio of the
split-adjusted shares outstanding at the fiscal year ending in calendar year t−1 to the split-adjusted
shares outstanding at the fiscal year ending in t − 2. The split-adjusted shares outstanding is shares
outstanding (Compustat annual item CSHO) times the adjustment factor (item AJEX). At the end
of June of each year t, we sort stocks with negative Nsi into two portfolios (1 and 2), stocks with
zero Nsi into one portfolio (3), and stocks with positive Nsi into seven portfolios (4 to 10). Monthly
decile returns are from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.3.11

dIi, % Change in Investment - % Change in Industry Investment

Following Abarbanell and Bushee (1998), we define the %d(·) operator as the percentage change in
the variable in the parentheses from its average over the prior two years, e.g., %d(Investment) =
82

[Investment(t) − E[Investment(t)]]/E[Investment(t)], in which E[Investment(t)] = [Investment(t−1)
+ Investment(t − 2)]/2. dIi is defined as %d(Investment) − %d(Industry investment), in which
investment is capital expenditure in property, plant, and equipment (Compustat annual item
CAPXV). Industry investment is the aggregate investment across all firms with the same twodigit SIC code. Firms with non-positive E[Investment(t)] are excluded and we require at least two
firms in each industry. At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on dIi
for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July
of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.3.12

Cei, Composite Equity Issuance

At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on composite equity issuance, Cei, which is the log growth rate in the market equity not attributable to stock return,
log (MEt /MEt−5 ) − r(t − 5, t). r(t − 5, t) is the cumulative log stock return from the last trading
day of June in year t − 5 to the last trading day of June in year t, and MEt is the market equity
(from CRSP) on the last trading day of June in year t. Monthly decile returns are from July of
year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.3.13

Cdi, Composite Debt Issuance

Following Lyandres, Sun, and Zhang (2008), at the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into
deciles based on composite debt issuance, Cdi, which is the log growth rate of the book value of
debt (Compustat annual item DLC plus item DLTT) from the fiscal year ending in calendar year
t − 6 to the fiscal year ending in year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year
t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of year t + 1.
A.3.14

Ivg, Inventory Growth

At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on inventory growth, Ivg, which
is the annual growth rate in inventory (Compustat annual item INVT) from the fiscal year ending
in calendar year t − 2 to the fiscal year ending in t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from
July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.3.15

Ivc, Inventory Changes

At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on inventory changes, Ivc, which
is the annual change in inventory (Compustat annual item INVT) scaled by the average of total
assets (item AT) for the fiscal years ending in t − 2 and t − 1. We exclude firms that carry no
inventory for the past two fiscal years. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to
June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.3.16

Oa, Operating Accruals

Prior to 1988, we use the balance sheet approach in Sloan (1996) to measure operating accruals, Oa,
as changes in noncash working capital minus depreciation, in which the noncash working capital is
changes in noncash current assets minus changes in current liabilities less short-term debt and taxes
payable. In particular, Oa equals (dCA−dCASH)−(dCL−dSTD−dTP)−DP, in which dCA is the
change in current assets (Compustat annual item ACT), dCASH is the change in cash or cash equivalents (item CHE), dCL is the change in current liabilities (item LCT), dSTD is the change in debt
83

included in current liabilities (item DLC), dTP is the change in income taxes payable (item TXP),
and DP is depreciation and amortization (item DP). Missing changes in income taxes payable are
set to zero. Starting from 1988, we follow Hribar and Collins (2002) to measure Oa using the statement of cash flows as net income (item NI) minus net cash flow from operations (item OANCF).
Doing so helps mitigate measurement errors that can arise from nonoperating activities such as acquisitions and divestitures. Data from the statement of cash flows are only available since 1988. At
the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles on Oa for the fiscal year ending in calendar
year t − 1 scaled by total assets (item AT) for the fiscal year ending in t − 2. Monthly decile returns
are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.3.17

Ta, Total Accruals

Prior to 1988, we use the balance sheet approach in Richardson, Sloan, Soliman, and Tuna (2005)
to measure total accruals, Ta, as dWc + dNco + dFin. dWc is the change in net non-cash working
capital. Net non-cash working capital is current operating asset (Coa) minus current operating
liabilities (Col), with Coa = current assets (Compustat annual item ACT) − cash and short-term
investments (item CHE) and Col = current liabilities (item LCT) − debt in current liabilities (item
DLC). dNco is the change in net non-current operating assets. Net non-current operating assets are
non-current operating assets (Nca) minus non-current operating liabilities (Ncl), with Nca = total
assets (item AT) − current assets − long-term investments (item IVAO), and Ncl = total liabilities
(item LT) − current liabilities − long-term debt (item DLTT). dFin is the change in net financial
assets. Net financial assets are financial assets (Fna) minus financial liabilities (Fnl), with Fna =
short-term investments (item IVST) + long-term investments, and Fnl = long-term debt + debt
in current liabilities + preferred stocks (item PSTK). Missing changes in debt in current liabilities,
long-term investments, long-term debt, short-term investments, and preferred stocks are set to zero.
Starting from 1988, we use the cash flow approach to measure Ta as net income (item NI) minus
total operating, investing, and financing cash flows (items OANCF, IVNCF, and FINCF) plus sales
of stocks (item SSTK, zero if missing) minus stock repurchases and dividends (items PRSTKC and
DV, zero if missing). Data from the statement of cash flows are only available since 1988. At the
end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Ta for the fiscal year ending in
calendar year t − 1 scaled by total assets for the fiscal year ending in t − 2. Monthly decile returns
are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.3.18

dWc, dCoa, and dCol, Changes in Net Non-cash Working Capital, in Current
Operating Assets, and in Current Operating Liabilities

Richardson, Sloan, Soliman, and Tuna (2005, Table 10) show that several components of total
accruals also forecast returns in the cross section. dWc is the change in net non-cash working
capital. Net non-cash working capital is current operating asset (Coa) minus current operating
liabilities (Col), with Coa = current assets (Compustat annual item ACT) − cash and short term
investments (item CHE) and Col = current liabilities (item LCT) − debt in current liabilities (item
DLC). dCoa is the change in current operating asset and dCol is the change in current operating
liabilities. Missing changes in debt in current liabilities are set to zero. At the end of June of
each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based, separately, on dWc, dCoa, and dCol for the fiscal
year ending in calendar year t − 1, all scaled by total assets (item AT) for the fiscal year ending in
calendar year t − 2. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and
the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
84

A.3.19

dNco, dNca, and dNcl, Changes in Net Non-current Operating Assets, in
Non-current Operating Assets, and in Non-current Operating Liabilities

dNco is the change in net non-current operating assets. Net non-current operating assets are noncurrent operating assets (Nca) minus non-current operating liabilities (Ncl), with Nca = total assets
(Compustat annual item AT) − current assets (item ACT) − long-term investments (item IVAO),
and Ncl = total liabilities (item LT) − current liabilities (item LCT) − long-term debt (item
DLTT). dNca is the change in non-current operating assets and dNcl is the change in non-current
operating liabilities. Missing changes in long-term investments and long-term debt are set to zero.
At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based, separately, on dNco, dNca, and
dNcl for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1, all scaled by total assets for the fiscal year
ending in calendar year t − 2. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of
t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.3.20

dFin, dSti, dLti, dFnl, and dBe, Changes in Net Financial Assets, in Shortterm Investments, in Long-term Investments, in Financial Liabilities, and in
Book Equity

dFin is the change in net financial assets. Net financial assets are financial assets (Fna) minus
financial liabilities (Fnl), with Fna = short-term investments (Compustat annual item IVST) +
long-term investments (item IVAO), and Fnl = long-term debt (item DLTT) + debt in current
liabilities (item DLC) + preferred stock (item PSTK). dSti is the change in short-term investments,
dLti is the change in long-term investments, and dFnl is the change in financial liabilities. dBe
is the change in book equity (item CEQ). Missing changes in debt in current liabilities, long-term
investments, long-term debt, short-term investments, and preferred stocks are set to zero (at least
one change has to be non-missing when constructing any variable). When constructing dSti (dLti),
we exclude firms that do not have long-term (short-term) investments in the past two fiscal years.
At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based, separately, on dFin, dSti, dLti,
dFnl, and dBe for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1, all scaled by total assets (item AT)
for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 2. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July
of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.3.21

Dac, Discretionary Accruals

We measure discretionary accruals, Dac, using the modified Jones model from Dechow, Sloan, and
Sweeney (1995):
1
dSALEi,t − dRECi,t
PPEi,t
Oai,t
= α1
+ α2
+ α3
+ ei,t ,
Ai,t−1
Ai,t−1
Ai,t−1
Ai,t−1

(A7)

in which Oai,t is operating accruals for firm i (see Appendix A.3.16), At−1 is total assets (Compustat annual item AT) at the end of year t − 1, dSALEi,t is the annual change in sales (item SALE)
from year t − 1 to t, dRECi,t is the annual change in net receivables (item RECT) from year t − 1
to t, and PPEi,t is gross property, plant, and equipment (item PPEGT) at the end of year t. We
estimate the cross-sectional regression (A7) for each two-digit SIC industry and year combination,
formed separately for NYSE/AMEX firms and for NASDAQ firms. We require at least six firms for
each regression. The discretionary accrual for stock i is defined as the residual from the regression,
ei,t . At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Dac for the fiscal year

85

ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of
t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.3.22

Poa, Percent Operating Accruals

Accruals are traditionally scaled by total assets. Hafzalla, Lundholm, and Van Winkle (2011) show
that scaling accruals by the absolute value of earnings (percent accruals) is more effective in selecting firms for which the differences between sophisticated and naive forecasts of earnings are the
most extreme. To construct the percent operating accruals (Poa) deciles, at the end of June of each
year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on operating accruals scaled by the absolute value of net
income (Compustat annual item NI) for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. See Appendix
A.3.16 for the measurement of operating accruals. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July
of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.3.23

Pta, Percent Total Accruals

At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles on percent total accruals, Pta, calculated as total accruals scaled by the absolute value of net income (Compustat annual item NI)
for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. See Appendix A.3.17 for the measurement of total
accruals. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles
are rebalanced in June of year t + 1.
A.3.24

Pda, Percent Discretionary Accruals

At the end of June of each year t, we split stocks into deciles based on percent discretionary accruals,
Pda, calculated as the discretionary accruals, Dac, for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1
multiplied with total assets (Compustat annual item AT) for the fiscal year ending in t − 2 scaled
by the absolute value of net income (item NI) for the fiscal year ending in t − 1. See Appendix
A.3.21 for the measurement of discretionary accruals. Monthly decile returns are calculated from
July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.3.25

Nxf, Nef, and Ndf, Net External, Equity, and Debt Financing

Net external financing, Nxf, is the sum of net equity financing, Nef, and net debt financing, Ndf
(Bradshaw, Richardson, and Sloan 2006). Nef is the proceeds from the sale of common and preferred stocks (Compustat annual item SSTK) less cash payments for the repurchases of common
and preferred stocks (item PRSTKC) less cash payments for dividends (item DV). Ndf is the cash
proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt (item DLTIS) less cash payments for long-term debt
reductions (item DLTR) plus the net changes in current debt (item DLCCH, zero if missing). At
the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Nxf, and, separately, on Nef and
Ndf, for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1 scaled by the average of total assets for fiscal
years ending in t − 2 and t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June
of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1. Because the data on financing activities
start in 1971, the portfolios start in July 1972.

Profitability
Roe1, Roe6, and Roe12, Return on Equity

Return on equity, Roe, is income before extraordinary items (Compustat quarterly item IBQ) divided by one-quarter-lagged book equity (Hou, Xue, and Zhang 2015). Book equity is shareholders’
equity, plus balance sheet deferred taxes and investment tax credit (item TXDITCQ) if available,
minus the book value of preferred stock (item PSTKQ). Depending on availability, we use stockholders’ equity (item SEQQ), or common equity (item CEQQ) plus the book value of preferred stock,
or total assets (item ATQ) minus total liabilities (item LTQ) in that order as shareholders’ equity.
Before 1972, the sample coverage is limited for quarterly book equity in Compustat quarterly
files. We expand the coverage by using book equity from Compustat annual files as well as by
imputing quarterly book equity with clean surplus accounting. Specifically, whenever available we
first use quarterly book equity from Compustat quarterly files. We then supplement the coverage
for fiscal quarter four with annual book equity from Compustat annual files. Following Davis, Fama,
and French (2000), we measure annual book equity as stockholders’ book equity, plus balance sheet
deferred taxes and investment tax credit (Compustat annual item TXDITC) if available, minus
the book value of preferred stock. Stockholders’ equity is the value reported by Compustat (item
SEQ), if available. If not, stockholders’ equity is the book value of common equity (item CEQ) plus
the par value of preferred stock (item PSTK), or the book value of assets (item AT) minus total
liabilities (item LT). Depending on availability, we use redemption (item PSTKRV), liquidating
(item PSTKL), or par value (item PSTK) for the book value of preferred stock.
If both approaches are unavailable, we apply the clean surplus relation to impute the book
equity. First, if available, we backward impute the beginning-of-quarter book equity as the endof-quarter book equity minus quarterly earnings plus quarterly dividends. Quarterly earnings are
income before extraordinary items (Compustat quarterly item IBQ). Quarterly dividends are zero
if dividends per share (item DVPSXQ) are zero. Otherwise, total dividends are dividends per share
times beginning-of-quarter shares outstanding adjusted for stock splits during the quarter. Shares
outstanding are from Compustat (quarterly item CSHOQ supplemented with annual item CSHO
for fiscal quarter four) or CRSP (item SHROUT), and the share adjustment factor is from Compustat (quarterly item AJEXQ supplemented with annual item AJEX for fiscal quarter four) or
CRSP (item CFACSHR). Because we impose a four-month lag between earnings and the holding
period month (and the book equity in the denominator of ROE is one-quarter-lagged relative to
earnings), all the Compustat data in the backward imputation are at least four-month lagged prior
to the portfolio formation. If data are unavailable for the backward imputation, we impute the
book equity for quarter t forward based on book equity from prior quarters. Let BEQt−j , 1 ≤ j ≤ 4
denote the latest available quarterly book equity as of quarter t, and IBQt−j+1,t and DVQt−j+1,t
be the sum of quarterly earnings and quarterly dividends from quarter t − j + 1 to t, respectively.
BEQt can then be imputed as BEQt−j + IBQt−j+1,t − DVQt−j+1,t . We do not use prior book equity
from more than four quarters ago (i.e., 1 ≤ j ≤ 4) to reduce imputation errors.
At the beginning of each month t, we sort all stocks into deciles based on their most recent
past Roe. Before 1972, we use the most recent Roe computed with quarterly earnings from fiscal quarters ending at least four months prior to the portfolio formation. Starting from 1972, we
use Roe computed with quarterly earnings from the most recent quarterly earnings announcement
dates (Compustat quarterly item RDQ). For a firm to enter the portfolio formation, we require
the end of the fiscal quarter that corresponds to its most recent Roe to be within six months prior
to the portfolio formation. This restriction is imposed to exclude stale earnings information. To
87

avoid potentially erroneous records, we also require the earnings announcement date to be after
the corresponding fiscal quarter end. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month
t (Roe1), from month t to t + 5 (Roe6), and from month t to t + 11 (Roe12). The deciles are
rebalanced monthly. The holding period that is longer than one month as in, for instance, Roe6,
means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated
in a different month in the prior six-month period. We take the simple average of the subdeciles
returns as the monthly return of the Roe6 decile.
A.4.2

dRoe1, dRoe6, and dRoe12, Changes in Return on Equity

Change in return on equity, dRoe, is return on equity minus its value from four quarters ago. See
Appendix A.4.1 for the measurement of return on equity. At the beginning of each month t, we sort
all stocks into deciles on their most recent past dRoe. Before 1972, we use the most recent dRoe
with quarterly earnings from fiscal quarters ending at least four months ago. Starting from 1972, we
use dRoe computed with quarterly earnings from the most recent quarterly earnings announcement
dates (Compustat quarterly item RDQ). For a firm to enter the portfolio formation, we require the
end of the fiscal quarter that corresponds to its most recent dRoe to be within six months prior
to the portfolio formation. This restriction is imposed to exclude stale earnings information. To
avoid potentially erroneous records, we also require the earnings announcement date to be after
the corresponding fiscal quarter end. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month
t (dRoe1), from month t to t + 5 (dRoe6), and from month t to t + 11 (dRoe12). The deciles are
rebalanced monthly. The holding period that is longer than one month as in, for instance, dRoe6,
means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated
in a different month in the prior six-month period. We take the simple average of the subdeciles
returns as the monthly return of the dRoe6 decile.
A.4.3

Roa1, Roa6, and Roa12, Return on Assets

Return on assets, Roa, is income before extraordinary items (Compustat quarterly item IBQ) divided by one-quarter-lagged total assets (item ATQ). At the beginning of each month t, we sort all
stocks into deciles based on Roa computed with quarterly earnings from the most recent earnings
announcement dates (item RDQ). For a firm to enter the portfolio formation, we require the end
of the fiscal quarter that corresponds to its most recent Roa to be within six months prior to the
portfolio formation. This restriction is imposed to exclude stale earnings information. To avoid
potentially erroneous records, we also require the earnings announcement date to be after the corresponding fiscal quarter end. Monthly decile returns are calculated for month t (Roa1), from month
t to t+5 (Roe6), and from month t to t+11 (Roe12). The deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of
t + 1. The holding period that is longer than one month as in, for instance, Roa6, means that for a
given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month
in the prior six-month period. We take the simple average of the subdeciles returns as the monthly
return of the Roa6 decile. For sufficient data coverage, the Roa portfolios start in January 1972.
A.4.4

dRoa1, dRoa6, and dRoa12, Changes in Return on Assets

Change in return on assets, dRoa, is return on assets minus its value from four quarters ago. See
Appendix A.4.3 for the measurement of return on assets. At the beginning of each month t, we
sort all stocks into deciles based on dRoa computed with quarterly earnings from the most recent

88

earnings announcement dates (Compustat quarterly item RDQ). For a firm to enter the portfolio formation, we require the end of the fiscal quarter that corresponds to its most recent dRoa
to be within six months prior to the portfolio formation. This restriction is imposed to exclude
stale earnings information. To avoid potentially erroneous records, we also require the earnings
announcement date to be after the corresponding fiscal quarter end. Monthly decile returns are
calculated for month t (dRoa1), from month t to t + 5 (dRoa6), and from month t to t + 11
(dRoa12). The deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of t + 1. The holding period that is longer
than one month as in, for instance, dRoa6, means that for a given decile in each month there exist
six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month period. We
take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the dRoa6 decile. For
sufficient data coverage, the dRoa portfolios start in January 1973.
A.4.5

Rna, Pm, and Ato, Return on Net Operating Assets, Profit Margin, Asset
Turnover

Soliman (2008) use DuPont analysis to decompose Roe as Rna + FLEV × SPREAD, in which
Roe is return on equity, Rna is return on net operating assets, FLEV is financial leverage, and
SPREAD is the difference between return on net operating assets and borrowing costs. We can
further decompose Rna as Pm × Ato, in which Pm is profit margin and Ato is asset turnover.
Following Soliman (2008), we use annual sorts to form Rna, Pm, and Ato deciles. At the end
of June of year t, we measure Rna as operating income after depreciation (Compustat annual item
OIADP) for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1 divided by net operating assets (Noa) for
the fiscal year ending in t − 2. Noa is operating assets minus operating liabilities. Operating assets
are total assets (item AT) minus cash and short-term investment (item CHE), and minus other
investment and advances (item IVAO, zero if missing). Operating liabilities are total assets minus
debt in current liabilities (item DLC, zero if missing), minus long-term debt (item DLTT, zero if
missing), minus minority interests (item MIB, zero if missing), minus preferred stocks (item PSTK,
zero if missing), and minus common equity (item CEQ). Pm is operating income after depreciation
divided by sales (item SALE) for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Ato is sales for the
fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1 divided by Noa for the fiscal year ending in t − 2. At the
end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into three sets of deciles based on Rna, Pm, and Ato. We
exclude firms with non-positive Noa for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 2 when forming
the Rna and the Ato portfolios. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June
of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.4.6

Cto, Capital Turnover

At the end of June of each year t, we split stocks into deciles based on capital turnover, Cto,
measured as sales (Compustat annual item SALE) for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1
divided by total assets (item AT) for the fiscal year ending in t − 2. Monthly decile returns are
calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.4.7

Rnaq 1, Rnaq 6, Rnaq 12, Pmq 1, Pmq 6, Pmq 12, Atoq 1, Atoq 6, and Atoq 12,
Quarterly Return on Net Operating Assets, Quarterly Profit Margin,
Quarterly Asset Turnover

Quarterly return on net operating assets, Rnaq , is quarterly operating income after depreciation
(Compustat quarterly item OIADPQ) divided by one-quarter-lagged net operating assets (Noa).
89

Noa is operating assets minus operating liabilities. Operating assets are total assets (item ATQ)
minus cash and short-term investments (item CHEQ), and minus other investment and advances
(item IVAOQ, zero if missing). Operating liabilities are total assets minus debt in current liabilities
(item DLCQ, zero if missing), minus long-term debt (item DLTTQ, zero if missing), minus minority
interests (item MIBQ, zero if missing), minus preferred stocks (item PSTKQ, zero if missing), and
minus common equity (item CEQQ). Quarterly profit margin, Pmq , is quarterly operating income
after depreciation divided by quarterly sales (item SALEQ). Quarterly asset turnover, Atoq , is
quarterly sales divided by one-quarter-lagged Noa.
At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Rnaq or Pmq for the
latest fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago. Separately, we sort stocks into deciles based
on Atoq computed with quarterly sales from the most recent earnings announcement dates (item
RDQ). Sales are generally announced with earnings during quarterly earnings announcements (Jegadeesh and Livnat 2006). For a firm to enter the portfolio formation, we require the end of the
fiscal quarter that corresponds to its most recent Atoq to be within six months prior to the portfolio
formation. This restriction is imposed to exclude stale information. To avoid potentially erroneous
records, we also require the earnings announcement date to be after the corresponding fiscal quarter
end. Monthly decile returns are calculated for month t (Rnaq 1, Pmq 1, and Atoq 1), from month t
to t + 5 (Rnaq 6, Pmq 6, and Atoq 6), and from month t to t + 11 (Rnaq 12, Pmq 12, and Atoq 12). The
deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of t + 1. The holding period that is longer than one month
as in, for instance, Atoq 6, means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles,
each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month period. We take the simple
average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Atoq6 decile. For sufficient data
coverage, the Rnaq portfolios start in January 1976 and the Atoq portfolios start in January 1972.
A.4.8

Ctoq 1, Ctoq 6, and Ctoq 12, Quarterly Capital Turnover

Quarterly capital turnover, Ctoq , is quarterly sales (Compustat quarterly item SALEQ) scaled by
one-quarter-lagged total assets (item ATQ). At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into
deciles based on Ctoq computed with quarterly sales from the most recent earnings announcement
dates (item RDQ). Sales are generally announced with earnings during quarterly earnings announcements (Jegadeesh and Livnat 2006). For a firm to enter the portfolio formation, we require the end
of the fiscal quarter that corresponds to its most recent Atoq to be within six months prior to the
portfolio formation. This restriction is imposed to exclude stale information. To avoid potentially
erroneous records, we also require the earnings announcement date to be after the corresponding
fiscal quarter end. Monthly decile returns are calculated for month t (Ctoq 1), from month t to t + 5
(Ctoq 6), and from month t to t + 11 (Ctoq 12). The deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of t + 1.
The holding period that is longer than one month as in, for instance, Ctoq 6, means that for a given
decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the
prior six-month period. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return
of the Ctoq 6 decile. For sufficient data coverage, the Ctoq portfolios start in January 1972.
A.4.9

Gpa, Gross Profits-to-assets

Following Novy-Marx (2013), we measure gross profits-to-assets, Gpa, as total revenue (Compustat
annual item REVT) minus cost of goods sold (item COGS) divided by total assets (item AT, the
denominator is current, not lagged, total assets). At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks

90

into deciles based on Gpa for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns
are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.4.10

Gla, Gross Profits-to-lagged assets

Gross profits-to-lagged assets, Gla, is total revenue (Compustat annual item REVT) minus cost
of goods sold (item COGS) divided by one-year-lagged total assets (item AT). At the end of June
of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Gla for the fiscal year ending in calendar year
t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles
are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.4.11

Glaq 1, Glaq 6, and Glaq 12, Quarterly Gross Profits-to-lagged Assets

Glaq , is quarterly total revenue (Compustat quarterly item REVTQ) minus cost of goods sold (item
COGSQ) divided by one-quarter-lagged total assets (item ATQ). At the beginning of each month
t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Glaq for the fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago.
Monthly decile returns are calculated for month t (Glaq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Glaq 6), and from
month t to t + 11 (Glaq 12). The deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of t + 1. The holding
period that is longer than one month as in, for instance, Glaq 6, means that for a given decile in
each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior
six-month period. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of
the Glaq 6 decile. For sufficient data coverage, the Glaq portfolios start in January 1976.
A.4.12

Ope, Operating Profits to Equity

Following Fama and French (2015), we measure operating profitability to equity, Ope, as total revenue (Compustat annual item REVT) minus cost of goods sold (item COGS, zero if missing), minus
selling, general, and administrative expenses (item XSGA, zero if missing), and minus interest expense (item XINT, zero if missing), scaled by book equity (the denominator is current, not lagged,
book equity). We require at least one of the three expense items (COGS, XSGA, and XINT) to
be non-missing. Book equity is stockholders’ book equity, plus balance sheet deferred taxes and
investment tax credit (item TXDITC) if available, minus the book value of preferred stock. Stockholders’ equity is the value reported by Compustat (item SEQ), if it is available. If not, we measure
stockholders’ equity as the book value of common equity (item CEQ) plus the par value of preferred
stock (item PSTK), or the book value of assets (item AT) minus total liabilities (item LT). Depending on availability, we use redemption (item PSTKRV), liquidating (item PSTKL), or par value
(item PSTK) for the book value of preferred stock. At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks
into deciles based on Ope for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns
are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.4.13

Ole, Operating profits-to-lagged Equity

Ole is total revenue (Compustat annual item REVT) minus cost of goods sold (item COGS, zero
if missing), minus selling, general, and administrative expenses (item XSGA, zero if missing), and
minus interest expense (item XINT, zero if missing), scaled by one-year-lagged book equity. We require at least one of the three expense items (COGS, XSGA, and XINT) to be non-missing. Book
equity is stockholders’ book equity, plus balance sheet deferred taxes and investment tax credit
(item TXDITC) if available, minus the book value of preferred stock. Stockholders’ equity is the

91

value reported by Compustat (item SEQ), if it is available. If not, we measure stockholders’ equity
as the book value of common equity (item CEQ) plus the par value of preferred stock (item PSTK),
or the book value of assets (item AT) minus total liabilities (item LT). Depending on availability,
we use redemption (item PSTKRV), liquidating (item PSTKL), or par value (item PSTK) for the
book value of preferred stock. At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles on Ole
for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July
of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.4.14

Oleq 1, Oleq 6, and Oleq 12, Quarterly Operating Profits-to-lagged Equity

Quarterly operating profits-to-lagged equity, Oleq , is quarterly total revenue (Compustat quarterly
item REVTQ) minus cost of goods sold (item COGSQ, zero if missing), minus selling, general, and
administrative expenses (item XSGAQ, zero if missing), and minus interest expense (item XINTQ,
zero if missing), scaled by one-quarter-lagged book equity. We require at least one of the three
expense items (COGSQ, XSGAQ, and XINTQ) to be non-missing. Book equity is shareholders’
equity, plus balance sheet deferred taxes and investment tax credit (item TXDITCQ) if available,
minus the book value of preferred stock (item PSTKQ). Depending on availability, we use stockholders’ equity (item SEQQ), or common equity (item CEQQ) plus the book value of preferred stock,
or total assets (item ATQ) minus total liabilities (item LTQ) in that order as shareholders’ equity.
At the beginning of each month t, we split stocks on Oleq for the fiscal quarter ending at least
four months ago. Monthly decile returns are calculated for month t (Oleq 1), from month t to t + 5
(Oleq 6), and from month t to t + 11 (Oleq 12). The deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of t + 1.
The holding period longer than one month as in Oleq 6 means that for a given decile in each month
there exist six subdeciles, each initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take the
simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Oleq 6 decile. For sufficient
data coverage, the Oleq portfolios start in January 1972.
A.4.15

Opa, Operating Profits-to-assets

Following Ball, Gerakos, Linnainmaa, and Nikolaev (2015), we measure operating profits-to-assets,
Opa, as total revenue (Compustat annual item REVT) minus cost of goods sold (item COGS),
minus selling, general, and administrative expenses (item XSGA), and plus research and development expenditures (item XRD, zero if missing), scaled by book assets (item AT, the denominator
is current, not lagged, total assets). At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles
based on Opa for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated
from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.4.16

Ola, Operating Profits-to-lagged Assets

Operating profits-to-lagged assets, Ola, is total revenue (Compustat annual item REVT) minus
cost of goods sold (item COGS), minus selling, general, and administrative expenses (item XSGA),
and plus research and development expenditures (item XRD, zero if missing), scaled by one-yearlagged book assets (item AT). At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based
on Ola for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from
July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.

92

A.4.17

Olaq 1, Olaq 6, and Olaq 12, Quarterly Operating Profits-to-lagged Assets

Quarterly operating profits-to-lagged assets, Olaq , is quarterly total revenue (Compustat quarterly
item REVTQ) minus cost of goods sold (item COGSQ), minus selling, general, and administrative expenses (item XSGAQ), plus research and development expenditures (item XRDQ, zero if
missing), scaled by one-quarter-lagged book assets (item ATQ). At the beginning of each month
t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Olaq for the fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago.
Monthly decile returns are calculated for month t (Olaq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Olaq 6), and from
month t to t + 11 (Olaq 12). The deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of t + 1. The holding
period longer than one month as in Olaq 6 means that for a given decile in each month there exist six
subdeciles, each initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take the simple average
of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Olaq 6 decile. For sufficient data coverage, the
Olaq portfolios start in January 1976.
A.4.18

Cop, Cash-based Operating Profitability

Following Ball, Gerakos, Linnainmaa, and Nikolaev (2016), we measure cash-based operating profitability, Cop, as total revenue (Compustat annual item REVT) minus cost of goods sold (item
COGS), minus selling, general, and administrative expenses (item XSGA), plus research and development expenditures (item XRD, zero if missing), minus change in accounts receivable (item
RECT), minus change in inventory (item INVT), minus change in prepaid expenses (item XPP),
plus change in deferred revenue (item DRC plus item DRLT), plus change in trade accounts payable
(item AP), and plus change in accrued expenses (item XACC), all scaled by book assets (item AT,
the denominator is current, not lagged, total assets). All changes are annual changes in balance
sheet items and we set missing changes to zero. At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks
into deciles based on Cop for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns
are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.4.19

Cla, Cash-based Operating Profits-to-lagged Assets

Cash-based operating profits-to-lagged assets, Cla, is total revenue (Compustat annual item REVT)
minus cost of goods sold (item COGS), minus selling, general, and administrative expenses (item
XSGA), plus research and development expenditures (item XRD, zero if missing), minus change
in accounts receivable (item RECT), minus change in inventory (item INVT), minus change in
prepaid expenses (item XPP), plus change in deferred revenue (item DRC plus item DRLT), plus
change in trade accounts payable (item AP), and plus change in accrued expenses (item XACC),
all scaled by one-year-lagged book assets (item AT). All changes are annual changes in balance
sheet items and we set missing changes to zero. At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks
into deciles based on Cla for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns
are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.4.20

Claq 1, Claq 6, and Claq 12, Quarterly Cash-based Operating Profits-to-lagged
Assets

Quarterly cash-based operating profits-to-lagged assets, Cla, is quarterly total revenue (Compustat
quarterly item REVTQ) minus cost of goods sold (item COGSQ), minus selling, general, and administrative expenses (item XSGAQ), plus research and development expenditures (item XRDQ,
zero if missing), minus change in accounts receivable (item RECTQ), minus change in inventory

93

(item INVTQ), plus change in deferred revenue (item DRCQ plus item DRLTQ), and plus change
in trade accounts payable (item APQ), all scaled by one-quarter-lagged book assets (item ATQ).
All changes are quarterly changes in balance sheet items and we set missing changes to zero. At
the beginning of each month t, we split stocks on Claq for the fiscal quarter ending at least four
months ago. Monthly decile returns are calculated for month t (Claq 1), from month t to t + 5
(Claq 6), and from month t to t + 11 (Claq 12). The deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of t + 1.
The holding period longer than one month as in Claq 6 means that for a given decile in each month
there exist six subdeciles, each initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take the
simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Claq 6 decile. For sufficient
data coverage, the Claq portfolios start in January 1976.
A.4.21

F, Fundamental Score

Piotroski (2000) classifies each fundamental signal as either good or bad depending on the signal’s
implication for future stock prices and profitability. An indicator variable for a particular signal
is one if its realization is good and zero if it is bad. The aggregate signal, denoted F, is the sum
of the nine binary signals. F is designed to measure the overall quality, or strength, of the firm’s
financial position. Nine fundamental signals are chosen to measure three areas of a firm’s financial
condition, profitability, liquidity, and operating efficiency.
Four variables are selected to measure profitability: (i) Roa is income before extraordinary
items (Compustat annual item IB) scaled by one-year-lagged total assets (item AT). If the firm’s
Roa is positive, the indicator variable FRoa equals one and zero otherwise. (ii) Cf/A is cash flow
from operation scaled by one-year-lagged total assets. Cash flow from operation is net cash flow
from operating activities (item OANCF) if available, or funds from operation (item FOPT) minus
the annual change in working capital (item WCAP). If the firm’s Cf/A is positive, the indicator
variable FCf/A equals one and zero otherwise. (iii) dRoa is the current year’s Roa less the prior
year’s Roa. If dRoa is positive, the indicator variable FdROA is one and zero otherwise. Finally,
(iv) the indicator FAcc equals one if Cf/A > Roa and zero otherwise.
Three variables are selected to measure changes in capital structure and a firm’s ability to meet
future debt obligations. Piotroski (2000) assumes that an increase in leverage, a deterioration of
liquidity, or the use of external financing is a bad signal about financial risk. (i) dLever is the change
in the ratio of total long-term debt (Compustat annual item DLTT) to the average of current and
one-year-lagged total assets. FdLever is one if the firm’s leverage ratio falls, i.e., dLever < 0, and zero
otherwise. (ii) dLiquid measures the change in a firm’s current ratio from the prior year, in which
the current ratio is the ratio of current assets (item ACT) to current liabilities (item LCT). An
improvement in liquidity (∆dLiquid > 0) is a good signal about the firm’s ability to service current
debt obligations. The indicator FdLiquid equals one if the firm’s liquidity improves and zero otherwise. (iii) The indicator, Eq, equals one if the firm does not issue common equity during the current
year and zero otherwise. The issuance of common equity is sales of common and preferred stocks
(item SSTK) minus any increase in preferred stocks (item PSTK). Issuing equity is interpreted as
a bad signal (inability to generate sufficient internal funds to service future obligations).
The remaining two signals are designed to measure changes in the efficiency of the firm’s operations that reflect two key constructs underlying the decomposition of return on assets. (i) dMargin
is the firm’s current gross margin ratio, measured as gross margin (Compustat annual item SALE
minus item COGS) scaled by sales (item SALE), less the prior year’s gross margin ratio. An improvement in margins signifies a potential improvement in factor costs, a reduction in inventory
94

costs, or a rise in the price of the firm’s product. The indictor FdMargin equals one if dMargin > 0
and zero otherwise. (ii) dTurn is the firm’s current year asset turnover ratio, measured as total
sales scaled by one-year-lagged total assets (item AT), minus the prior year’s asset turnover ratio.
An improvement in asset turnover ratio signifies greater productivity from the asset base. The
indicator, FdTurn , equals one if dTurn > 0 and zero otherwise.
Piotroski (2000) forms a composite score, F, as the sum of the individual binary signals:
F ≡ FRoa + FdRoa + FCf/A + FAcc + FdMargin + FdTurn + FdLever + FdLiquid + Eq.

(A8)

At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks based on F for the fiscal year ending in calender
year t − 1 to form seven portfolios: low (F = 0,1,2), 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and high (F = 8, 9). Because
extreme F scores are rare, we combine scores 0, 1, and 2 into the low portfolio and scores 8 and
9 into the high portfolio. Monthly portfolio returns are calculated from July of year t to June of
t + 1, and the portfolios are rebalanced in June of t + 1. For sufficient data coverage, the F portfolio
returns start in July 1972.
A.4.22

Fq 1, Fq 6, and Fq 12, Quarterly Fundamental Score

To construct quarterly F-score, Fq , we use quarterly accounting data and the same nine binary
signals from Piotroski (2000). Among the four signals related to profitability: (i) Roa is quarterly
income before extraordinary items (Compustat quarterly item IBQ) scaled by one-quarter-lagged
total assets (item ATQ). If the firm’s Roa is positive, the indicator variable FRoa equals one and
zero otherwise. (ii) Cf/A is quarterly cash flow from operation scaled by one-quarter-lagged total
assets. Cash flow from operation is the quarterly change in year-to-date net cash flow from operating
activities (item OANCFY) if available, or the quarterly change in year-to-date funds from operation
(item FOPTY) minus the quarterly change in working capital (item WCAPQ). If the firm’s Cf/A
is positive, the indicator variable FCf/A equals one and zero otherwise. (iii) dRoa is the current
quarter’s Roa less the Roa from four quarters ago. If dRoa is positive, the indicator variable FdROA is
one and zero otherwise. Finally, (iv) the indicator FAcc equals one if Cf/A > Roa and zero otherwise.
Among the three signals related changes in capital structure and a firm’s ability to meet future
debt obligations: (i) dLever is the change in the ratio of total long-term debt (Compustat quarterly
item DLTTQ) to the average of current and one-quarter-lagged total assets. FdLever is one if
the firm’s leverage ratio falls, i.e., dLever < 0, relative to its value four quarters ago, and zero
otherwise. (ii) dLiquid measures the change in a firm’s current ratio between the current quarter
and four quarters ago, in which the current ratio is the ratio of current assets (item ACTQ) to
current liabilities (item LCTQ). An improvement in liquidity (dLiquid > 0) is a good signal about
the firm’s ability to service current debt obligations. The indicator FdLiquid equals one if the firm’s
liquidity improves and zero otherwise. (iii) The indicator, Eq, equals one if the firm does not issue
common equity during the past four quarters and zero otherwise. The issuance of common equity
is sales of common and preferred stocks minus any increase in preferred stocks (item PSTKQ). To
measure sales of common and preferred stocks, we first compute the quarterly change in year-to-date
sales of common and preferred stocks (item SSTKY) and then take the total change for the past
four quarters. Issuing equity is interpreted as a bad signal (inability to generate sufficient internal
funds to service future obligations). For the remaining two signals, (i) dMargin is the firm’s current
gross margin ratio, measured as gross margin (item SALEQ minus item COGSQ) scaled by sales
(item SALEQ), less the gross margin ratio from four quarters ago. The indictor FdMargin equals one
if dMargin > 0 and zero otherwise. (ii) dTurn is the firm’s current asset turnover ratio, measured
95

as (item SALEQ) scaled by one-quarter-lagged total assets (item ATQ), minus the asset turnover
ratio from four quarters ago. The indicator, FdTurn , equals one if dTurn > 0 and zero otherwise.
The composite score, Fq , is the sum of the individual binary signals:
Fq ≡ FRoa + FdRoa + FCf/A + FAcc + FdMargin + FdTurn + FdLever + FdLiquid + Eq.

(A9)

At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks based on Fq for the fiscal quarter ending at least
four quarters ago to form seven portfolios: low (Fq = 0,1,2), 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and high (Fq = 8, 9).
Monthly portfolio returns are calculated for month t (Fq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Fq 6), and from
month t to t + 11 (Fq 12), and the portfolios are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The
holding period longer than one month as in, for instance, Fq 6, means that for a given portfolio in
each month there exist six subportfolios, each of which is initiated in a different month in prior six
months. We take the simple average of the subportfolio returns as the monthly return of the Fq 6
portfolio. For sufficient data coverage, the Fq portfolios start in January 1985.

Fp, Fpq 1, Fpq 6, and Fpq 12, Failure Probability

Failure probability (Fp) is from Campbell, Hilscher, and Szilagyi (2008, Table IV, Column 3):

and φ = 2−1/3 . NIMTA is net income (Compustat quarterly item NIQ) divided by the sum of
market equity (share price times the number of shares outstanding from CRSP) and total liabilities
(item LTQ). The moving average NIMTAAVG captures the idea that a long history of losses
is a better predictor of bankruptcy than one large quarterly loss in a single month. EXRET ≡
log(1+ Rit )− log(1+ RS&P500,t ) is the monthly log excess return on each firm’s equity relative to the
S&P 500 index. The moving average EXRETAVG captures the idea that a sustained decline in stock
market value is a better predictor of bankruptcy than a sudden stock price decline in a single month.
TLMTA is total liabilities divided by the sum of market equity
total liabilities. SIGMA is
q and
252 P
2
the annualized three-month rolling sample standard deviation:
k∈{t−1,t−2,t−3} rk , in which
N −1
k is the index of trading days in months t − 1, t − 2, and t − 3, rk is the firm-level daily return, and N
is the total number of trading days in the three-month period. SIGMA is treated as missing if there
are less than five nonzero observations over the three months in the rolling window. RSIZE is the
relative size of each firm measured as the log ratio of its market equity to that of the S&P 500 index.
CASHMTA, aimed to capture the liquidity position of the firm, is cash and short-term investments
(Compustat quarterly item CHEQ) divided by the sum of market equity and total liabilities (item
LTQ). MB is the market-to-book equity, in which we add 10% of the difference between the market
equity and the book equity to the book equity to alleviate measurement issues for extremely small
book equity values (Campbell, Hilscher, and Szilagyi 2008). For firm-month observations that still
96

have negative book equity after this adjustment, we replace these negative values with $1 to ensure
that the market-to-book ratios for these firms are in the right tail of the distribution. PRICE is
each firm’s log price per share, truncated above at $15. We further eliminate stocks with prices
less than $1 at the portfolio formation date. We winsorize the variables on the right-hand side of
equation (A10) at the 1th and 99th percentiles of their distributions each month.
To form the Fp deciles, we sort stocks at the end of June of year t based on Fp calculated with
accounting data from the fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago. Because unlike earnings,
other quarterly data items in the definition of Fp might not be available upon earnings announcement, we impose a four-month gap between the fiscal quarter end and portfolio formation to guard
against look-ahead bias. We calculate decile returns from July of year t to June of year t+1, and the
deciles are rebalanced in June. For sufficient data coverage, the Fp deciles start in January 1976.
At the beginning of each month t, we split stocks into deciles based on Fp calculated with accounting data from the fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago. We calculate decile returns
for the current month t (Fpq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Fpq 6), and from month t to t + 11 (Fpq 12).
The deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period that is longer than
one month as in, for instance, Fpq 6, means that for a given decile in each month there exist six
subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month period. We take
the simple average of the subdeciles returns as the monthly return of the Fpq 6 decile. For sufficient
data coverage, the quarterly Fp deciles start in January 1976.
A.4.24

O, Oq 1, Oq 6, and Oq 12, Ohlson’s O-score

We follow Ohlson (1980, Model One in Table 4) to construct O-score (Dichev 1998):
O ≡ −1.32 − 0.407 log(TA) + 6.03TLTA − 1.43WCTA + 0.076CLCA
− 1.72OENEG − 2.37NITA − 1.83FUTL + 0.285INTWO − 0.521CHIN,

(A13)

in which TA is total assets (Compustat annual item AT). TLTA is the leverage ratio defined as
total debt (item DLC plus item DLTT) divided by total assets. WCTA is working capital (item
ACT minus item LCT) divided by total assets. CLCA is current liability (item LCT) divided by
current assets (item ACT). OENEG is one if total liabilities (item LT) exceeds total assets and zero
otherwise. NITA is net income (item NI) divided by total assets. FUTL is the fund provided by
operations (item PI plus item DP) divided by total liabilities. INTWO is equal to one if net income
is negative for the last two years and zero otherwise. CHIN is (NIs − NIs−1 )/(|NIs | + |NIs−1 |), in
which NIs and NIs−1 are the net income for the current and prior years. We winsorize all nondummy variables on the right-hand side of equation (A13) at the 1th and 99th percentiles of their
distributions each year. At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on
O-score for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from
July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
We use quarterly accounting data to construct the quarterly O-score as:
Oq ≡ −1.32 − 0.407 log(TAq ) + 6.03TLTAq − 1.43WCTAq + 0.076CLCAq
− 1.72OENEGq − 2.37NITAq − 1.83FUTLq + 0.285INTWOq − 0.521CHINq ,

(A14)

in which TAq is total assets (Compustat quarterly item ATQ). TLTAq is the leverage ratio defined
as total debt (item DLCQ plus item DLTTQ) divided by total assets. WCTAq is working capital
97

(item ACTQ minus item LCT) divided by total assets. CLCAq is current liability (item LCTQ)
divided by current assets (item ACTQ). OENEGq is one if total liabilities (item LTQ) exceeds total
assets and zero otherwise. NITAq is the sum of net income (item NIQ) for the trailing four quarters
divided by total assets at the end of the current quarter. FUTLq is the the sum of funds provided
by operations (item PIQ plus item DPQ) for the trailing four quarters divided by total liabilities
at the end of the current quarter. INTWOq is equal to one if net income is negative for the current
quarter and four quarters ago, and zero otherwise. CHINq is (NIQs − NIQs−4 )/(|NIQs |+ |NIQs−4 |),
in which NIQs and NIQs−4 are the net income for the current quarter and four quarters ago. We
winsorize all non-dummy variables on the right-hand side of equation (A14) at the 1th and 99th
percentiles of their distributions each month.
At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Oq calculated with accounting data from the fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago. We calculate decile returns
for the current month t (Oq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Oq 6), and from month t to t + 11 (Oq 12).
The deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period that is longer than
one month as in, for instance, Oq 6, means that for a given decile in each month there exist six
subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month period. We take
the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Oq 6 decile. For sufficient
data coverage, the Oq portfolios start in January 1973.
A.4.25

Z, Zq 1, Zq 6, and Zq 12, Altman’s Z-score

We follow Altman (1968) to construct the Z-score (Dichev 1998):
Z ≡ 1.2WCTA + 1.4RETA + 3.3EBITTA + 0.6METL + SALETA,

(A15)

in which WCTA is working capital (Compustat annual item ACT minus item LCT) divided by
total assets (item AT), RETA is retained earnings (item RE) divided by total assets, EBITTA
is earnings before interest and taxes (item OIADP) divided by total assets, METL is the market
equity (from CRSP, at fiscal year end) divided by total liabilities (item LT), and SALETA is sales
(item SALE) divided by total assets. For firms with more than one share class, we merge the
market equity for all share classes before computing Z. We winsorize all non-dummy variables on
the right-hand side of equation (A15) at the 1th and 99th percentiles of their distributions each
year. At the end of June of each year t, we split stocks into deciles based on Z-score for the fiscal
year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to
June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
We use quarterly accounting data to construct the quarterly Z-score as:
Zq ≡ 1.2WCTAq + 1.4RETAq + 3.3EBITTAq + 0.6METLq + SALETAq ,

(A16)

in which WCTAq is working capital (Compustat quarterly item ACTQ minus item LCTQ) divided by total assets (item ATQ), RETAq is retained earnings (item REQ) divided by total assets,
EBITTAq is the sum of earnings before interest and taxes (item OIADPQ) for the trailing four
quarters divided by total assets at the end of the current quarter, METLq is the market equity
(from CRSP, at fiscal quarter end) divided by total liabilities (item LTQ), and SALETAq is the
sum of sales (item SALEQ) for the trailing four quarters divided by total assets at the end of the
current quarter. For firms with more than one share class, we merge the market equity for all
share classes before computing Zq . We winsorize all non-dummy variables on the right-hand side
98

of equation (A16) at the 1th and 99th percentiles of their distributions each month.
At the beginning of each month t, we split stocks into deciles based on Zq calculated with accounting data from the fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago. We calculate decile returns
for the current month t (Zq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Zq 6), and from month t to t + 11 (Zq 12).
The deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period that is longer than
one month as in, for instance, Zq 6, means that for a given decile in each month there exist six
subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month period. We take
the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Zq 6 decile. For sufficient
data coverage, the Zq portfolios start in January 1973.
A.4.26

G, Growth Score

Following Mohanram (2005), we construct the G-score as the sum of eight binary signals: G ≡ G1 +
. . .+G8 . G1 equals one if a firm’s return on assets (Roa) is greater than the median Roa in the same
industry (two-digit SIC code), and zero otherwise. Roa is net income before extraordinary items
(Compustat annual item IB) scaled by the average of total assets (item AT) from the current and
prior years. We also calculate an alternative measure of Roa using cash flow from operations instead
of net income. Cash flow from operation is net cash flow from operating activities (item OANCF) if
available, or funds from operation (item FOPT) minus the annual change in working capital (item
WCAP). G2 equals one if a firm’s cash flow Roa exceeds the industry median, and zero otherwise.
G3 equals one if a firm’s cash flow from operations exceeds net income, and zero otherwise.
G4 equals one if a firm’s earnings variability is less than the industry median. Earnings variability is the variance of a firm’s quarterly Roa during the past 16 quarters (six quarters minimum).
Quarterly Roa is quarterly net income before extraordinary items (Compustat quarterly item IBQ)
scaled by one-quarter-lagged total assets (item ATQ). G5 equals one if a firm’s sales growth variability is less the industry median, and zero otherwise. Sales growth variability is the variance of a
firm’s quarterly sales growth during the past 16 quarters (six quarters minimum). Quarterly sales
growth is the growth in quarterly sales (item SALEQ) from its value four quarters ago.
G6 equals one if a firm’s R&D (Compustat annual item XRD) deflated by one-year-lagged total
assets is greater than the industry median, and zero otherwise. G7 equals one if a firm’s capital
expenditure (item CAPX) deflated by one-year-lagged total assets is greater than the industry
median, and zero otherwise. G8 equals one if a firm’s advertising expenses (item XAD) deflated by
one-year-lagged total assets is greater than the industry median, and zero otherwise.
At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks on G for the fiscal year ending in calender year t−
1 to form seven portfolios: low (F = 0,1), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and high (F = 7,8). Because extreme G scores
are rare, we combine scores 0, and 1 into the low portfolio and scores 7 and 8 into the high portfolio.
Monthly portfolio returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the portfolios are
rebalanced in June of t + 1. For sufficient data coverage, the G portfolio returns start in July 1976.
A.4.27

Cr1, Cr6, and Cr12, Credit Ratings

Following Avramov, Chordia, Jostova, and Philipov (2009), we measure credit ratings, Cr, by
transforming S&P ratings into numerical scores as follows: AAA=1, AA+=2, AA=3, AA−=4,
A+=5, A=6, A−=7, BBB+=8, BBB=9, BBB−=10, BB+=11, BB=12, BB−=13, B+=14, B=15,
B−=16, CCC+=17, CCC=18, CCC−=19, CC=20, C=21, and D=22. At the beginning of each
month t, we sort stocks into quintiles based on Cr at the end of t − 1. We do not form deciles
99

because a disproportional number of firms can have the same rating, which leads to fewer than ten
portfolios. We calculate quintile returns for the current month t (Cr1), from month t to t + 5 (Cr6),
and from month t to t + 11 (Cr12). The quintiles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1.
The holding period that is longer than one month as in, for instance, Cr6, means that for a given
quintile in each month there exist six subquintiles, each of which is initiated in a different month in
the prior six-month period. We take the simple average of the subquintiles returns as the monthly
return of the Cr6 quintile. For sufficient data coverage, the Cr portfolios start in January 1986.
A.4.28

Tbi, Taxable Income-to-book Income

Following Green, Hand, and Zhang (2013), we measure taxable income-to-book income, Tbi, as
pretax income (Compustat annual item PI) divided by net income (item NI). At the end of June
of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Tbi for the fiscal year ending in calendar year
t − 1. We exclude firms with non-positive pretax income or net income. Monthly decile returns are
calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.4.29

Tbiq 1, Tbiq 6, and Tbiq 12, Quarterly Taxable Income-to-book Income

Quarterly taxable income-to-book income, Tbiq , is quarterly pretax income (Compustat quarterly
item PIQ) divided by net income (NIQ). At the beginning of each month t, we split stocks into
deciles based on Tbiq calculated with accounting data from the fiscal quarter ending at least four
months ago. We exclude firms with non-positive pretax income or net income. We calculate monthly
decile returns for the current month t (Tbiq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Tbiq 6), and from month t to
t+11 (Tbiq 12). The deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t+1. The holding period that
is longer than one month as in, for instance, Tbiq 6, means that for a given decile in each month there
exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month period.
We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Tbiq 6 decile.
A.4.30

Bl, Book Leverage

Following Fama and French (1992), we measure book leverage, Bl, as total assets (Compustat annual item AT) divided by book equity. Following Davis, Fama, and French (2000), we measure book
equity as stockholders’ book equity, plus balance sheet deferred taxes and investment tax credit
(item TXDITC) if available, minus the book value of preferred stock. Stockholders’ equity is the
value reported by Compustat (item SEQ), if it is available. If not, we measure stockholders’ equity
as the book value of common equity (item CEQ) plus the par value of preferred stock (item PSTK),
or the book value of assets (item AT) minus total liabilities (item LT). Depending on availability,
we use redemption (item PSTKRV), liquidating (item PSTKL), or par value (item PSTK) for the
book value of preferred stock. At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based
on Bl for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from
July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.4.31

Blq 1, Blq 6, and Blq 12, Quarterly Book Leverage

Quarterly book leverage, Blq , is total assets (Compustat quarterly item ATQ) divided by book
equity. Book equity is shareholders’ equity, plus balance sheet deferred taxes and investment tax
credit (item TXDITCQ) if available, minus the book value of preferred stock (item PSTKQ). Depending on availability, we use stockholders’ equity (item SEQQ), or common equity (item CEQQ)

100

plus the book value of preferred stock, or total assets (item ATQ) minus total liabilities (item LTQ)
in that order as shareholders’ equity. At the beginning of each month t, we split stocks into deciles
on Blq for the fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago. We calculate monthly decile returns
for the current month t (Blq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Blq 6), and from month t to t + 11 (Blq 12).
The deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period that is longer than
one month as in, for instance, Blq 6, means that for a given decile in each month there exist six
subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month period. We take
the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Blq 6 decile. For sufficient
data coverage, the Blq portfolios start in January 1972.
A.4.32

Sgq 1, Sgq 6, and Sgq 12, Quarterly Sales Growth

Quarterly sales growth, Sgq , is quarterly sales (Compustat quarterly item SALEQ) divided by its
value four quarters ago. At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on the
latest Sgq . Before 1972, we use the most recent Sgq from fiscal quarters ending at least four months
ago. Starting from 1972, we use Sgq from the most recent quarterly earnings announcement dates
(item RDQ). Sales are generally announced with earnings during quarterly earnings announcements
(Jegadeesh and Livnat 2006). For a firm to enter the portfolio formation, we require the end of the
fiscal quarter that corresponds to its most recent Sgq to be within six months prior to the portfolio
formation. This restriction is imposed to exclude stale information. To avoid potentially erroneous
records, we also require the earnings announcement date to be after the corresponding fiscal quarter
end. We calculate monthly decile returns for the current month t (Sgq 1), from month t to t + 5
(Sgq 6), and from month t to t + 11 (Sgq 12). The deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month
t + 1. The holding period that is longer than one month as in, for instance, Sgq 6, means that for a
given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month
in the prior six-month period. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly
return of the Sgq 6 decile.

A.5.1

Intangibles
Oca and Ioca, (Industry-adjusted) Organizational Capital-to-assets

Following Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou (2013), we construct the stock of organization capital, Oc,
using the perpetual inventory method:
Ocit = (1 − δ)Ocit−1 + SG&Ait /CPIt ,

(A17)

in which Ocit is the organization capital of firm i at the end of year t, SG&Ait is selling, general, and
administrative (SG&A) expenses (Compustat annual item XSGA) in t, CPIt is the average consumer price index during year t, and δ is the annual depreciation rate of Oc. The initial stock of Oc
is Oci0 = SG&Ai0 /(g+δ), in which SG&Ai0 is the first valid SG&A observation (zero or positive) for
firm i and g is the long-term growth rate of SG&A. We assume a depreciation rate of 15% for Oc and
a long-term growth rate of 10% for SG&A. Missing SG&A values after the starting date are treated
as zero. For portfolio formation at the end of June of year t, we require SG&A to be non-missing for
the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1 because this SG&A value receives the highest weight in
Oc. In addition, we exclude firms with zero Oc. Organizational Capital-to-assets, Oca, is Oc scaled
by total assets (item AT). We also industry-standardize Oca using the FF (1997) 17-industry classification. To calculate the industry-adjusted Oca, Ioca, we demean a firm’s Oca by its industry mean

101

and then divide the demeaned Oca by the standard deviation of Oca within its industry. To alleviate the impact of outliers, we winsorize Oca at the 1 and 99 percentiles of all firms each year before
the industry standardization. At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on
Oca, and separately, on Ioca, for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t−1. Monthly decile returns
are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.5.2

Adm, Advertising Expense-to-market

At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on advertising expenses-tomarket, Adm, which is advertising expenses (Compustat annual item XAD) for the fiscal year
ending in calendar year t − 1 divided by the market equity (from CRSP) at the end of December
of t − 1. For firms with more than one share class, we merge the market equity for all share classes
before computing Adm. We keep only firms with positive advertising expenses. Monthly decile
returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June
of t + 1. Because sufficient XAD data start in 1972, the Adm portfolios start in July 1973.
A.5.3

gAd, Growth in Advertising Expense

At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on growth in advertising expenses,
gAd, which is the growth rate of advertising expenses (Compustat annual item XAD) from the fiscal
year ending in calendar year t − 2 to the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Following Lou
(2014), we keep only firms with advertising expenses of at least 0.1 million dollars. Monthly decile
returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June
of t + 1. Because sufficient XAD data start in 1972, the gAd portfolios start in July 1974.
A.5.4

Rdm, R&D Expense-to-market

At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on R&D-to-market, Rdm, which
is R&D expenses (Compustat annual item XRD) for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1
divided by the market equity (from CRSP) at the end of December of t − 1. For firms with more
than one share class, we merge the market equity for all share classes before computing Rdm. We
keep only firms with positive R&D expenses. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of
year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1. Because the accounting
treatment of R&D expenses was standardized in 1975, the Rdm portfolios start in July 1976.
A.5.5

Rdmq 1, Rdmq 6, and Rdmq 12, Quarterly R&D Expense-to-market

At the beginning of each month t, we split stocks into deciles based on quarterly R&D-to-market,
Rdmq , which is quarterly R&D expense (Compustat quarterly item XRDQ) for the fiscal quarter
ending at least four months ago scaled by the market equity (from CRSP) at the end of t − 1.
For firms with more than one share class, we merge the market equity for all share classes before
computing Rdmq . We keep only firms with positive R&D expenses. We calculate decile returns
for the current month t (Rdmq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Rdmq 6), and from month t to t + 11
(Rdmq 12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period
longer than one month as in, for instance, Rdmq 6, means that for a given decile in each month
there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months.
We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Rdmq 6 decile.
Because the quarterly R&D data start in late 1989, the Rdmq portfolios start in January 1990.

A.5.6

Rds, R&D Expenses-to-sales

At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on R&D-to-sales, Rds, which
is R&D expenses (Compustat annual item XRD) divided by sales (item SALE) for the fiscal year
ending in calendar year t − 1. We keep only firms with positive R&D expenses. Monthly decile
returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June
of t + 1. Because the accounting treatment of R&D expenses was standardized in 1975, the Rds
portfolios start in July 1976.
A.5.7

Rdsq 1, Rdsq 6, and Rdsq 12, Quarterly R&D Expense-to-sales

At the beginning of each month t, we split stocks into deciles based on quarterly R&D-to-sales, Rdsq ,
which is quarterly R&D expense (Compustat quarterly item XRDQ) scaled by sales (item SALEQ)
for the fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago. We keep only firms with positive R&D
expenses. We calculate decile returns for the current month t (Rdsq 1), from month t to t+5 (Rdsq 6),
and from month t to t + 11 (Rdsq 12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1.
The holding period longer than one month as in, for instance, Rdsq 6, means that for a given decile
in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior
six months. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Rdsq 6
decile. Because the quarterly R&D data start in late 1989, the Rdsq portfolios start in January 1990.
A.5.8

Ol, Operating Leverage

Following Novy-Marx (2011), operating leverage, Ol, is operating costs scaled by total assets (Compustat annual item AT, the denominator is current, not lagged, total assets). Operating costs are
cost of goods sold (item COGS) plus selling, general, and administrative expenses (item XSGA).
At the end of June of year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Ol for the fiscal year ending in
calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and
the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.5.9

Olq 1, Olq 6, and Olq 12, Quarterly Operating Leverage

At the beginning of each month t, we split stocks into deciles based on quarterly operating leverage,
Olq , which is quarterly operating costs divided by assets (Compustat quarterly item ATQ) for the
fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago. Operating costs are the cost of goods sold (item
COGSQ) plus selling, general, and administrative expenses (item XSGAQ). We calculate decile
returns for the current month t (Olq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Olq 6), and from month t to t + 11
(Olq 12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period longer
than one month as in, for instance, Olq 6, means that for a given decile in each month there exist
six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take the
simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Olq 6 decile. For sufficient data
coverage, the Olq portfolios start in January 1972.
A.5.10

Hn, Hiring Rate

Following Belo, Lin, and Bazdresch (2014), at the end of June of year t, we measure the hiring rate
(Hn) as (Nt−1 − Nt−2 )/(0.5Nt−1 + 0.5Nt−2 ), in which Nt−j is the number of employees (Compustat
annual item EMP) from the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − j. At the end of June of year
t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Hn. We exclude firms with zero Hn (these observations are
103

often due to stale information on firm employment). Monthly decile returns are calculated from
July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.5.11

Rca, R&D Capital-to-assets

Following Li (2011), we measure R&D capital, Rc, by accumulating annual R&D expenses over the
past five years with a linear depreciation rate of 20%:
Rcit = XRDit + 0.8 XRDit−1 + 0.6 XRDit−2 + 0.4 XRDit−3 + 0.2 XRDit−4 ,

(A18)

in which XRDit−j is firm i’s R&D expenses (Compustat annual item XRD) in year t − j. R&D
capital-to-assets, Rca, is Rc scaled by total assets (item AT). At the end of June of each year t,
we sort stocks into deciles based on Rca for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. We keep
only firms with positive Rc. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of
t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1. For portfolio formation at the end of June of
year t, we require R&D expenses to be non-missing for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1,
because this value of R&D expenses receives the highest weight in Rc. Because Rc requires past
five years of R&D expenses data and the accounting treatment of R&D expenses was standardized
in 1975, the Rca portfolios start in July 1980.
A.5.12

Bca, Brand Capital-to-assets

Following Belo, Lin, and Vitorino (2014), we construct brand capital, Bc, by accumulating advertising expenses with the perpetual inventory method:
Bcit = (1 − δ)Bcit−1 + XADit .

(A19)

in which Bcit is the brand capital for firm i at the end of year t, XADit is the advertising expenses
(Compustat annual item XAD) in t, and δ is the annual depreciation rate of Bc. The initial stock
of Bc is Bci0 = XADi0 /(g + δ), in which XADi0 is first valid XAD (zero or positive) for firm i and
g is the long-term growth rate of XAD. Following Belo et al., we assume a depreciation rate of 50%
for Bc and a long-term growth rate of 10% for XAD. Missing values of XAD after the starting date
are treated as zero. For the portfolio formation at the end of June of year t, we exclude firms with
zero Bc and require XAD to be non-missing for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Brand
capital-to-assets, Bca, is Bc scaled by total assets (item AT). At the end of June of each year t,
we sort stocks into deciles based on Bca for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly
decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in
June of t + 1. Because sufficient XAD data start in 1972, the Bc portfolios start in July 1973.
A.5.13

Aop, Analysts Optimism

Following Frankel and Lee (1998), we measure analysts optimism, Aop, as (Vf−Vh)/|Vh|, in which
Vf is the analysts forecast-based intrinsic value, and Vh is the historical Roe-based intrinsic value.
See section A.2.27 for the construction of intrinsic values. At the end of June of each year t, we
sort stocks into deciles based on Aop. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to
June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.

104

A.5.14

Pafe, Predicted Analysts Forecast Error

Following Frankel and Lee (1998), we define analysts forecast errors for year t as the actual realized
Roe in year t + 3 minus the predicted Roe for t + 3 based on analyst forecasts. See section A.2.27
for the measurement of realized and predicted Roe. To calculate predicted analysts forecast errors,
Pafe, for the portfolio formation at the end of June of year t, we estimate the intercept and slopes of
the annual cross-sectional regressions of Roet−1 − Et−4 [Roet−1 ] on four firm characteristics for the
fiscal year ending in calendar year t−4, including prior five-year sales growth, book-to-market, longterm earnings growth forecast, and analysts optimism. Prior five-year sale growth is the growth rate
in sales (Compustat annual item SALE) from the fiscal year ending in calendar year t−9 to the fiscal
year ending in t−4. Book-to-market is book equity (item CEQ) for the fiscal year ending in calendar
year t−4 divided by the market equity (form CRSP) at the end of June in t−3. Long-term earnings
growth forecast is from IBES (unadjusted file, item MEANEST; fiscal period indicator = 0),
reported in June of t−3. See Section A.5.13 for the construction of analyst optimism. We winsorize
the regressors at the 1st and 99th percentiles of their respective pooled distributions each year, and
standardize all the regressors (by subtracting mean and dividing by standard deviation). Pafe for
the portfolio formation year t is then obtained by applying the estimated intercept and slopes on
the winsorized and standardized regressors for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. At the
end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Pafe. Monthly decile returns are
calculated from July of year t to June of t+1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t+1. Because
the long-term earnings growth forecast data start in 1981, the Pafe portfolios start in July 1985.
A.5.15

Parc, Patent-to-R&D Capital

Following Hirshleifer, Hsu, and Li (2013), we measure patent-to-R&D capital, Parc, as the ratio of
firm i’s patents granted in year t, Patentsit , scaled by its R&D capital for the fiscal year ending in
calendar year t − 2, Patentsit /(XRDit−2 + 0.8 XRDit−3 + 0.6 XRDit−4 + 0.4 XRDit−5 + 0.2 XRDit−6 ),
in which XRDit−j is R&D expenses (Compustat annual item XRD) for the fiscal year ending in
calendar year t − j. We require non-missing R&D expenses for the fiscal year ending in t − 2 but
set missing values to zero for other years (t − 6 to t − 3). The patent data are from the National
Bureau of Economic Research patent database and are available from 1976 to 2006. At the end of
June of each year t, we use Parc for t − 1 to form deciles. Stocks with zero Parc are grouped into
one portfolio (1) and stocks with positive Parc are sorted into nine portfolios (2 to 10). Monthly
decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in
June of t + 1. Because the accounting treatment of R&D expenses was standardized in 1975 and
the NBER patent data stop in 2006, the Parc portfolios are available from July 1982 to June 2008.
A.5.16

Crd, Citations-to-R&D Expenses

Following Hirshleifer, Hsu, and Li (2013), we measure citations-to-R&D expenses, Crd, in year t as
the adjusted number of citations occurring in year t to firm i’s patents granted over the previous
five years scaled by the sum of corresponding R&D expenses:
Crdt =

PNt−s t−s
s=1
k=1 Cik
,
P5
s=1 XRDit−2−s

P5

(A20)

t−s
in which Cik
is the number of citations received in year t by patent k, granted in year t−s scaled by
the average number of citations received in year t by all patents of the same subcategory granted in

105

year t−s. Nt−s is the total number of patents granted in year t−s to firm i. XRDit−2−s is R&D expenses (Compustat annual item XRD) for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t−2−s. At the end
of June of each year t, we use Crd for t−1 to form deciles. Stocks with zero Crd are grouped into one
portfolio (1) and stocks with positive Crd are sorted into nine portfolios (2 to 10). Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t+1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t+1.
A.5.17

Hs, Ha, and He, Industry Concentration (Sales, Assets, Book Equity)

Following Hou and Robinson (2006), we measure a firm’s industry concentration with the Herfindahl
P Nj 2
index, i=1
sij , in which sij is the market share of firm i in industry j, and Nj is the total number
of firms in the industry. We calculate the market share of a firm using sales (Compustat annual item
SALE), total assets (item AT), or book equity. Following Davis, Fama, and French (2000), we measure book equity as stockholders’ book equity, plus balance sheet deferred taxes and investment tax
credit (item TXDITC) if available, minus the book value of preferred stock. Stockholders’ equity
is the value reported by Compustat (item SEQ), if it is available. If not, we measure stockholders’
equity as the book value of common equity (item CEQ) plus the par value of preferred stock (item
PSTK), or the book value of assets (item AT) minus total liabilities (item LT). Depending on availability, we use redemption (item PSTKRV), liquidating (item PSTKL), or par value (item PSTK)
for the book value of preferred stock. Industries are defined by three-digit SIC codes. We exclude financial firms (SIC between 6000 and 6999) and firms in regulated industries. Following Barclay and
Smith (1995), the regulated industries include: railroads (SIC=4011) through 1980, trucking (4210
and 4213) through 1980, airlines (4512) through 1978, telecommunication (4812 and 4813) through
1982, and gas and electric utilities (4900 to 4939). To improve the accuracy of the concentration
measure, we exclude an industry if the market share data are available for fewer than five firms or
80% of all firms in the industry. We measure industry concentration as the average Herfindahl index
during the past three years. Industry concentrations calculated with sales, assets, and book equity
are denoted, Hs, Ha, and He, respectively. At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into
deciles based on Hs, Ha, and He for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t+1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t+1.
A.5.18

Age1, Age6, and Age12, Firm Age

Following Jiang, Lee, and Zhang (2005), we measure firm age, Age, as the number of months
between the portfolio formation date and the first month that a firm appears in Compustat or
CRSP (item permco). At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into quintiles based on Age
at the end of t − 1. We do not form deciles because a disproportional number of firms can have the
same Age (e.g., caused by the inception of Nasdaq coverage in 1973). Monthly quintile returns are
calculated for the current month t (Age1), from month t to t + 5 (Age6), and from month t to t + 11
(Age12), and the quintiles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period
longer than one month as in, for instance, Age6, means that for a given quintile in each month
there exist six subquintiles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months.
We take the simple average of the subquintiles returns as the monthly return of the Age6 quintile.

A.5.19

D1, D2, and D3, Price Delay

At the end of June of each year, we regress each stock’s weekly returns over the prior year on the
contemporaneous and four weeks of lagged market returns:
rit = αi + β i Rmt +

4
X

(−n)

δi

Rmt−n + ǫit ,

(A21)

n=1

in which rit is the return on stock j in week t, and Rmt is the return on the CRSP value-weighted
market index. Weekly returns are measured from Wednesday market close to the next Wednesday
market close. Following Hou and Moskowitz (2005), we calculate three price delay measures:
R2(−4)
D1i ≡ 1 −

in which se(·) is the standard error of the point estimate in parentheses.
To improve precision of the price delay estimate, we sort firms into portfolios based on market equity and individual delay measure, compute the delay measure for the portfolio, and assign
the portfolio delay measure to each firm in the portfolio. At the end of June of each year t, we
sort stocks into size deciles based on the market equity (from CRSP) at the end of June in t − j
(j = 1, 2, . . .). Within each size decile, we then sort stocks into deciles based on their first-stage
individual delay measure, estimated using weekly return data from July of year t − j − 1 to June
of year t − j. The equal-weighted weekly returns of the 100 size-delay portfolios are computed over
the following year from July of year t − j to June of t − j + 1. We then re-estimate the delay
measure for each of the 100 portfolios using the entire past sample of weekly returns up to June of
year t. The second-stage portfolio delay measure is then assigned to individual stocks within the
100 portfolios formed at end of June in year t. At the end of June of year t, we sort stocks into
deciles based on D1, D2, and D3. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June
of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.5.20

dSi, % Change in Sales Minus % Change in Inventory

Following Abarbanell and Bushee (1998), we define the %d(·) operator as the percentage change in
the variable in the parentheses from its average over the prior two years, e.g., %d(Sales) = [Sales(t)
− E[Sales(t)]]/E[Sales(t)], in which E[Sales(t)] = [Sales(t − 1) + Sales(t − 2)]/2. dSi is calculated
as %d(Sales) − %d(Inventory), in which sales is net sales (Compustat annual item SALE), and
107

inventory is finished goods inventories (item INVFG) if available, or total inventories (item INVT).
Firms with non-positive average sales or inventory during the past two years are excluded. At the
end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on dSi for the fiscal year ending in
calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and
the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.5.21

dSa, % Change in Sales Minus % Change in Accounts Receivable

Following Abarbanell and Bushee (1998), we define the %d(·) operator as the percentage change in
the variable in the parentheses from its average over the prior two years, e.g., %d(Sales) = [Sales(t)
− E[Sales(t)]]/E[Sales(t)], in which E[Sales(t)] = [Sales(t − 1) + Sales(t − 2)]/2. dSa is calculated as
%d(Sales) − %d(Accounts receivable), in which sales is net sales (Compustat annual item SALE)
and accounts receivable is total receivables (item RECT). Firms with non-positive average sales or
receivables during the past two years are excluded. At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks
into deciles based on dSa for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns
are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.5.22

dGs, % Change in Gross Margin Minus % Change in Sales

Following Abarbanell and Bushee (1998), we define the %d(·) operator as the percentage change in
the variable in the parentheses from its average over the prior two years, e.g., %d(Sales) = [Sales(t)
− E[Sales(t)]]/E[Sales(t)], in which E[Sales(t)] = [Sales(t − 1) + Sales(t − 2)]/2. dGs is calculated as
%d(Gross margin) − %d(Sales), in which sales is net sales (Compustat annual item SALE) and gross
margin is sales minus cost of goods sold (item COGS). Firms with non-positive average gross margin
or sales during the past two years are excluded. At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks
into deciles based on dGs for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns
are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.5.23

dSs, % Change in Sales Minus % Change in SG&A

Following Abarbanell and Bushee (1998), we define the %d(·) operator as the percentage change in
the variable in the parentheses from its average over the prior two years, e.g., %d(Sales) = [Sales(t)
− E[Sales(t)]]/E[Sales(t)], in which E[Sales(t)] = [Sales(t − 1) + Sales(t − 2)]/2. dSs is calculated as
%d(Sales) − %d(SG&A), in which sales is net sales (Compustat annual item SALE) and SG&A is
selling, general, and administrative expenses (item XSGA). Firms with non-positive average sales
or SG&A during the past two years are excluded. At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks
into deciles based on dSs for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns
are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.5.24

Etr, Effective Tax Rate

Following Abarbanell and Bushee (1998), we measure effective tax rate, Etr, as:
"
#
3
TaxExpense(t) 1 X TaxExpense(t − τ )
Etr(t) =
× dEPS(t),
−
EBT(t)
3
EBT(t − τ )

(A25)

τ =1

in which TaxExpense(t) is total income taxes (Compustat annual item TXT) paid in year t, EBT(t)
is pretax income (item PI) plus amortization of intangibles (item AM), and dEPS is the change in
108

split-adjusted earnings per share (item EPSPX divided by item AJEX) between years t − 1 and t,
deflated by stock price (item PRCC F) at the end of t−1. At the end of June of each year t, we sort
stocks into deciles based on Etr for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t+1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t+1.
A.5.25

Lfe, Labor Force Efficiency

Following Abarbanell and Bushee (1998), we measure labor force efficiency, Lfe, as:


Sales(t − 1)
Sales(t − 1)
Sales(t)
−
,
/
Lfe(t) =
Employees(t) Employees(t − 1) Employees(t − 1)

(A26)

in which Sales(t) is net sales (Compustat annual item SALE) in year t, and Employees(t) is the
number of employees (item EMP). At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles
based on Lfe for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated
from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.5.26

Ana1, Ana6, and Ana12, Analysts Coverage

Following Elgers, Lo, and Pfeiffer (2001), we measure analysts coverage, Ana, as the number of analysts’ earnings forecasts from IBES (item NUMEST) for the current fiscal year (fiscal period indicator = 1). We require earnings forecasts to be denominated in US dollars (currency code = USD). At
the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into quintiles on Ana from the IBES report in t−1. We
do not form deciles because a disproportional number of firms can have the same Ana before 1980.
Monthly quintile returns are calculated for the current month t (Ana1), from month t to t+5 (Ana6),
and from month t to t + 11 (Ana12). The quintiles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1.
The holding period longer than one month as in Ana6 means that for a given quintile in each month
there exist six subquintiles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months.
We take the simple average of the subquintile returns as the monthly return of the Ana6 quintile.
Because the earnings forecast data start in January 1976, the Ana portfolios start in February 1976.
A.5.27

Tan, Tangibility

Following Hahn and Lee (2009), we measure tangibility, Tan, as cash holdings (Compustat annual
item CHE) + 0.715 × accounts receivable (item RECT) + 0.547 × inventory (item INVT) + 0.535
× gross property, plant, and equipment (item PPEGT), all scaled by total assets (item AT). At the
end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles on Tan for the fiscal year ending in calendar
year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles
are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.5.28

Tanq 1, Tanq 6, and Tanq 12, Quarterly Tangibility

Tanq is cash holdings (Compustat quarterly item CHEQ) + 0.715 × accounts receivable (item
RECTQ) + 0.547 × inventory (item INVTQ) + 0.535 × gross property, plant, and equipment
(item PPEGTQ), all scaled by total assets (item ATQ). At the beginning of each month t, we sort
stocks into deciles based on Tanq for the fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago. Monthly
decile returns are calculated for the current month t (Tanq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Tanq 6), and
from month t to t + 11 (Tanq 12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1.
The holding period longer than one month as in, for instance, Tanq 6, means that for a given decile
109

in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior
six months. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Tanq 6
decile. For sufficient data coverage, the Tanq portfolios start in January 1972.
A.5.29

Rer, Industry-adjusted Real Estate Ratio

Following Tuzel (2010), we measure the real estate ratio as the sum of buildings (Compustat annual
item PPENB) and capital leases (item PPENLS) divided by net property, plant, and equipment
(item PPENT) prior to 1983. From 1984 onward, the real estate ratio is the sum of buildings at cost
(item FATB) and leases at cost (item FATL) divided by gross property, plant, and equipment (item
PPEGT). Industry-adjusted real estate ratio, Rer, is the real estate ratio minus its industry average. Industries are defined by two-digit SIC codes. To alleviate the impact of outliers, we winsorize
the real estate ratio at the 1st and 99th percentiles of its distribution each year before computing
Rer. Following Tuzel (2010), we exclude industries with fewer than five firms. At the end of June of
each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Rer for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1.
Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t+1. Because the real estate data start in 1969, the Rer portfolios start in July 1970.
A.5.30

Kz, Financial Constraints (the Kaplan-Zingales Index)

Following Lamont, Polk, and Saa-Requejo (2001), we construct the Kaplan-Zingales index, Kz, as:
Dividendsit
Debtit
Cashit
CFit
−39.368×
+0.283×Qit +3.139×
−1.315×
,
Kit−1
Total Capitalit
Kit−1
Kit−1
(A27)
in which CFit is firm i’s cash flows in year t, measured as income before extraordinary items (Compustat annual item IB) plus depreciation and amortization (item DP). Kit−1 is net property, plant,
and equipment (item PPENT) at the end of year t − 1. Qit is Tobin’s Q, measured as total assets
(item AT) plus the December-end market equity (from CRSP), minus book equity (item CEQ),
and minus deferred taxes (item TXDB), scaled by total assets. Debtit is the sum of short-term
debt (item DLC) and long-term debt (item DLTT). TotalCapital it is the sum of total debt and
stockholders’ equity (item SEQ). Dividendsit is total dividends (item DVC plus item DVP). Cashit
is cash holdings (item CHE). At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based
on Kz for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated from
July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.

Kzit ≡ −1.002×

A.5.31

Kzq 1, Kzq 6, and Kzq 12, Quarterly Kaplan-Zingales Index

We construct the quarterly Kaplan-Zingales index, Kzq , as:

Debtqit
Dividendsqit
Cashqit
CFqit
q
− 39.368
− 1.315 q , (A28)
≡ −1.002 q + 0.283Qit + 3.139
Kit−1
Total Capitalqit
Kqit−1
Kit−1

in which CFqit is firm i’s trailing four-quarter total cash flows from quarter t − 3 to t. Quarterly
cash flows are measured as income before extraordinary items (Compustat quarterly item IBQ)
plus depreciation and amortization (item DPQ). Kqit−1 is net property, plant, and equipment (item
PPENTQ) at the end of quarter t − 1. Qqit is Tobin’s Q, measured as total assets (item ATQ) plus
the fiscal-quarter-end market equity (from CRSP), minus book equity (item CEQQ), and minus

110

deferred taxes (item TXDBQ, zero if missing), scaled by total assets. Debtqit is the sum of shortterm debt (item DLCQ) and long-term debt (item DLTTQ). TotalCapital qit is the sum of total debt
and stockholders’ equity (item SEQQ). Dividendsqit is the total dividends (item DVPSXQ times
item CSHOQ), accumulated over the past four quarters from t − 3 to t.
At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Kzq for the fiscal quarter
ending at least four months ago. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month t
(Kzq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Kzq 6), and from month t to t + 11 (Kzq 12), and the deciles are
rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period longer than one month as in,
for instance, Kzq 6, means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of
which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take the simple average of the
subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Kzq 6 decile. For sufficient data coverage, the Kzq
portfolios start in January 1977.
A.5.32

Ww, Financial Constraints (the Whited-Wu Index)

Following Whited and Wu (2006, Equation 13), we construct the Whited-Wu index, Ww, as:
Wwit ≡ −0.091CFit − 0.062DIVPOSit + 0.021TLTDit − 0.044LNTA it + 0.102ISGit − 0.035SGit ,
(A29)
in which CFit is the ratio of firm i’s cash flows in year t scaled by total assets (Compustat annual
item AT) at the end of t. Cash flows are measured as income before extraordinary items (item
IB) plus depreciation and amortization (item DP). DIVPOSit is an indicator that takes the value
of one if the firm pays cash dividends (item DVPSX), and zero otherwise. TLTDit is the ratio of
the long-term debt (item DLTT) to total assets. LNTAit is the natural log of total assets. ISGit
is the firm’s industry sales growth, computed as the sum of current sales (item SALE) across all
firms in the industry divided by the sum of one-year-lagged sales minus one. Industries are defined
by three-digit SIC codes and we exclude industries with fewer than two firms. SGit is the firm’s
annual growth in sales. Because the coefficients in equation (A29) were estimated with quarterly
accounting data in Whited and Wu (2006), we convert annual cash flow and sales growth rates into
quarterly terms. Specifically, we divide CFit by four and use the compounded quarterly growth for
sales ((1 + ISGit )1/4 − 1 and (1 + SGit )1/4 − 1). At the end of June of each year t, we split stocks
into deciles based on Ww for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns
are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.5.33

Wwq 1, Wwq 6, and Wwq 12, the Quarterly Whited-Wu Index

We construct the quarterly Whited-Wu index, Wwq , as:
Wwqit ≡ −0.091CFqit − 0.062DIVPOSqit + 0.021TLTDqit − 0.044LNTA qit + 0.102ISGqit − 0.035SGqit ,
(A30)
in which CFqit is the ratio of firm i’s cash flows in quarter t scaled by total assets (Compustat
quarterly item ATQ) at the end of t. Cash flows are measured as income before extraordinary
items (item IBQ) plus depreciation and amortization (item DPQ). DIVPOSqit is an indicator that
takes the value of one if the firm pays cash dividends (item DVPSXQ), and zero otherwise. TLTDqit
is the ratio of the long-term debt (item DLTTQ) to total assets. LNTAqit is the natural log of
total assets. ISGqit is the firm’s industry sales growth, computed as the sum of current sales (item
SALEQ) across all firms in the industry divided by the sum of one-quarter-lagged sales minus one.
Industries are defined by three-digit SIC codes and we exclude industries with fewer than two firms.
111

SGqit is the firm’s quarterly growth in sales. At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into
deciles based on Wwq for the fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago. Monthly decile returns
are calculated for the current month t (Wwq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Wwq 6), and from month t
to t + 11 (Wwq 12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding
period longer than one month as in, for instance, Wwq 6, means that for a given decile in each
month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six
months. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Wwq 6
decile. For sufficient data coverage, the Wwq portfolios start in January 1972.
A.5.34

Sdd, Secured Debt-to-total Debt

Following Valta (2014), we measure secured debt-to-total debt, Sdd, as mortgages and other secured
debt (Compustat annual item DM) divided by total debt. Total debt is debt in current liabilities
(item DLC) plus long-term debt (item DLTT). At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks
into deciles based on Sdd for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Firms with no secured
debt are excluded. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and
the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1. Because the data on secured debt start in 1981, the
Sdd portfolios start in July 1982.
A.5.35

Cdd, Convertible Debt-to-total Debt

Following Valta (2014), we measure convertible debt-to-total debt, Cdd, as convertible debt (Compustat annual item DCVT) divided by total debt. Total debt is debt in current liabilities (item
DLC) plus long-term debt (item DLTT). At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into
deciles based on Cdd for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Firms with no convertible
debt are excluded. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and
the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1. Because the data on convertible debt start in 1969, the
Sdd portfolios start in July 1970.
A.5.36

Vcf1, Vcf6, and Vcf12, Cash Flow Volatility

Following Huang (2009), we measure cash flow volatility, Vcf, as the standard deviation of the ratio
of operating cash flows to sales (Compustat quarterly item SALEQ) during the past 16 quarters
(eight non-missing quarters minimum). Operating cash flows are income before extraordinary items
(item IBQ) plus depreciation and amortization (item DPQ), and plus the change in working capital
(item WCAPQ) from the last quarter. At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles
based on Vcf for the fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago. Monthly decile returns are
calculated for the current month t (Vcf1), from month t to t + 5 (Vcf6), and from month t to t + 11
(Vcf12). The deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period longer
than one month as in Vcf6 means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles,
each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take the simple average
of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Vcf6 decile. For sufficient data coverage, the
Vcf portfolios start in January 1978.
A.5.37

Cta1, Cta6, and Cta12, Cash-to-assets

Following Palazzo (2012), we measure cash-to-assets, Cta, as cash holdings (Compustat quarterly
item CHEQ) scaled by total assets (item ATQ). At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks

112

into deciles based on Cta from the fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago. Monthly decile
returns are calculated for the current month t (Cta1), from month t to t + 5 (Cta6), and from
month t to t + 11 (Cta12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of t + 1. The holding
period longer than one month as in, for instance, Cta6, means that for a given decile in each month
there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months.
We take the simple average of the subdeciles returns as the monthly return of the Cta6 decile. For
sufficient data coverage, the Cta portfolios start in January 1972.
A.5.38

Gind, Corporate Governance

The data for Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick’s (2003) firm-level corporate governance index (Gind,
from September 1990 to December 2006) are from Andrew Metrick’s Web site. Following Gompers et al. (Table VI), we use the following breakpoints to form the Gind portfolios: Gind ≤
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and ≥ 14. Firms with dual share classes are excluded. We rebalance the
portfolios in the months immediately following each publication of Gind, and calculate monthly
portfolio returns between two adjacent publication dates. The first months following the publication dates are September 1990, July 1993, July 1995, February 1998, November 1999, January 2002,
January 2004, and January 2006. The sample period for the Gind portfolios is from September
1990 to December 2006.
A.5.39

Acq, Acqq 1, Acqq 6, Acqq 12, Accrual Quality

Following Francis, Lafond, Olsson, and Schipper (2005), we estimate accrual quality (Acq) with
the following cross-sectional regression:
TCAit = φ0,i + φ1,i CFOit−1 + φ2,i CFOit + φ3,i CFOit+1 + φ4,i dREVit + φ5,i PPEit + vit ,

(A31)

in which TCAit is firm i’s total current accruals in year t, CFOit is cash flow from operations,
dREVit is change in revenues (Compustat annual item SALE) from t − 1 to t, and PPEit is gross
property, plant, and equipment (item PPEGT). TCAit = dCAit − dCLit − dCASHit + dSTDEBTit ,
in which dCAit is the change in current assets (item ACT) from year t − 1 to t, dCLit is the change
in current liabilities (item LCT), dCASHit is the change in cash (item CHE), and dSTDEBTit
is the change in debt in current liabilities (item DLC). CFOit = NIBEit − (dCAit − dCLit −
dCASHit + dSTDEBTit − DEPNit ), in which NIBEit is income before extraordinary items (item
IB), and DEPNit is depreciation and amortization expense (item DP). All variables are scaled by
the average of total assets in t and t − 1.
We estimate annual cross-sectional regressions in equation (A31) for each of Fama-French (1997)
48 industries (excluding four financial industries) with at least 20 firms in year t. We winsorize
the regressors at the 1st and 99th percentiles of their distributions each year. The annual crosssectional regressions yield firm- and year-specific residuals, vit . We measure accrual quality of firm
i, Acqi = σ(vi ), as the standard deviation of firm i’s residuals during the past five years from t − 4
to t. For a firm to be included in our portfolio, its residual has to be available for all five years.
At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Acq for the fiscal year
ending in calendar year t − 2. To avoid look-ahead bias, we do not sort on Acq for the fiscal year
ending in t − 1, because the regression in equation (A31) requires the next year’s CFO. Monthly
decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in
June of t + 1. In addition, at the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on
113

Acq calculated with data up to the fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago. Monthly decile
returns are calculated for the current month t (Acqq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Acqq 6), and from
month t to t + 11 (Acqq 12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of t + 1. The holding
period longer than one month as in, for instance, Acqq 6, means that for a given decile in each month
there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months.
We take the simple average of the subdeciles returns as the monthly return of the Acqq 6 decile.
A.5.40

Eper and Eprd, Earnings Persistence, Earnings Predictability

Following Francis, Lafond, Olsson, and Schipper (2004), we estimate earnings persistence, Eper,
and earnings predictability, Eprd, from a first-order autoregressive model for annual split-adjusted
earnings per share (Compustat annual item EPSPX divided by item AJEX). At the end of June
of each year t, we estimate the autoregressive model in the ten-year rolling window up to the fiscal
year ending in calendar year t − 1. Only firms with a complete ten-year history are included. Eper
is measured as the slope coefficient and Eprd is measured as the residual volatility. We sort stocks
into deciles based on Eper, and separately, on Eper. Monthly decile returns are calculated from
July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.5.41

Esm, Earnings Smoothness

Following Francis, Lafond, Olsson, and Schipper (2004), we measure earnings smoothness, Esm,
as the ratio of the standard deviation of earnings (Compustat annual item IB) scaled by one-yearlagged total assets (item AT) to the standard deviation of cash flow from operations scaled by
one-year-lagged total assets. Cash flow from operations is income before extraordinary items minus
operating accruals. We measure operating accruals as the one-year change in current assets (item
ACT) minus the change in current liabilities (item LCT), minus the change in cash (item CHE),
plus the change in debt in current liabilities (item DLC), and minus depreciation and amortization
(item DP). At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Esm, calculated
over the ten-year rolling window up to the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Only firms
with a complete ten-year history are included. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of
year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.5.42

Evr, Value Relevance of Earnings

Following Francis, Lafond, Olsson, and Schipper (2004), we measure value relevance of earnings,
Evr, as the R2 from the following rolling-window regression:
Rit = δ i0 + δi1 EARNit + δ i2 dEARNit + ǫit ,

(A32)

in which Rit is firm i’s 15-month stock return ending three months after the end of fiscal year ending in calendar year t. EARNit is earnings (Compustat annual item IB) for the fiscal year ending
in t, scaled by the fiscal year-end market equity (from CRSP). dEARNit is the one-year change
in earnings scaled by the market equity. For firms with more than one share class, we merge the
market equity for all share classes. At the end of June of each year t, we split stocks into deciles on
Evr, calculated over the ten-year rolling window up to the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1.
Only firms with a complete ten-year history are included. Monthly decile returns are calculated
from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.

114

A.5.43

Etl and Ecs, Earnings Timeliness, Earnings Conservatism

Following Francis, Lafond, Olsson, and Schipper (2004), we measure earnings timeliness, Etl, and
earnings conservatism, Ecs, from the following rolling-window regression:
EARNit = αi0 + αi1 NEGit + β i1 Rit + β i2 NEGit Rit + eit ,

(A33)

in which EARNit is earnings (Compustat annual item IB) for the fiscal year ending in calendar year
t, scaled by the fiscal year-end market equity. Rit is firm i’s 15-month stock return ending three
months after the end of fiscal year ending in calendar year t. NEGit equals one if Rit < 0, and
zero otherwise. For firms with more than one share class, we merge the market equity for all share
classes. We measure Etl as the R2 and Ecs as (β i1 + β i2 )/β i1 from the regression in (A33). At the
end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Etl, and separately, on Ecs, both
of which are calculated over the ten-year rolling window up to the fiscal year ending in calendar
year t − 1. Only firms with a complete ten-year history are included. Monthly decile returns are
calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.5.44

Frm and Fra, Pension Plan Funding Rate

Following Franzoni and Martin (2006), we define market pension plan funding rates as (PA −
PO)/ME (denoted Frm) and (PA − PO)/AT (denoted Fra), in which PA is the fair value of pension
plan assets, PO is the projected benefit obligation, ME is the market equity, and AT is total assets
(Compustat annual item AT). Between 1980 and 1997, PA is measured as the sum of overfunded
pension plan assets (item PPLAO) and underfunded pension plan assets (item PPLAU), and PO is
the sum of overfunded pension obligation (item PBPRO) and underfunded pension obligation (item
PBPRU). When the above data are not available, we also measure PA as pension benefits (item
PBNAA) and PO as the present value of vested benefits (item PBNVV) from 1980 to 1986. Starting
from 1998, firms are not required to report separate items for overfunded and underfunded plans,
and Compustat collapses PA and PO into corresponding items reserved previously for overfunded
plans (item PPLAO and item PBPRO). ME is from CRSP measured at the end of December. For
firms with more than one share class, we merge the market equity for all share classes.
At the end of June of each year t, we split stocks into deciles on Frm, and separately, on Fra,
both of which are for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1. Monthly decile returns are
calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
Because the pension data start in 1980, the Frm and Fra portfolios start in July 1981.
A.5.45

Ala and Alm, Asset Liquidity

Following Ortiz-Molina and Phillips (2014), we measure asset liquidity as cash + 0.75 × noncash
current assets + 0.50 × tangible fixed assets. Cash is cash and short-term investments (Compustat
annual item CHE). Noncash current assets is current assets (item ACT) minus cash. Tangible fixed
assets is total assets (item AT) minus current assets (item ACT), minus goodwill (item GDWL,
zero if missing), and minus intangibles (item INTAN, zero if missing). Ala is asset liquidity scaled
by one-year-lagged total assets. Alm is asset liquidity scaled by one-year-lagged market value of
assets. Market value of assets is total assets plus market equity (item PRCC F times item CSHO)
minus book equity (item CEQ). At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based
on Ala, and separately, on Alm, both of which are for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1.

115

Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are
rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.5.46

Alaq 1, Alaq 6, Alaq 12, Almq 1, Almq 6, and Almq 12, Quarterly Asset Liquidity

We measure quarterly asset liquidity as cash + 0.75 × noncash current assets + 0.50 × tangible
fixed assets. Cash is cash and short-term investments (Compustat quarterly item CHEQ). Noncash
current assets is current assets (item ACTQ) minus cash. Tangible fixed assets is total assets (item
ATQ) minus current assets (item ACTQ), minus goodwill (item GDWLQ, zero if missing), and
minus intangibles (item INTANQ, zero if missing). Alaq is quarterly asset liquidity scaled by onequarter-lagged total assets. Almq is quarterly asset liquidity scaled by one-quarter-lagged market
value of assets. Market value of assets is total assets plus market equity (item PRCCQ times item
CSHOQ) minus book equity (item CEQQ).
At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Alaq , and separately, on
Almq for the fiscal quarter ending at least four months ago. Monthly decile returns are calculated
for the current month t (Alaq 1 and Almq 1), from month t to t + 5 (Alaq 6 and Almq 6), and from
month t to t + 11 (Alaq 12 and Almq 12). The deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1.
The holding period longer than one month as in Alaq 6 means that for a given decile in each month
there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months.
We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Alaq 6 decile. For
sufficient data coverage, the quarterly asset liquidity portfolios start in January 1976.
A.5.47

Dls1, Dls6, and Dls12, Disparity between Long- and Short-term Earnings
Growth Forecasts

Following Da and Warachka (2011), we measure the implied short-term earnings growth forecast
as 100 × (A1t − A0t )/|A0t |, in which A1t is analysts’ consensus median forecast (IBES unadjusted
file, item MEDEST) for the current fiscal year (fiscal period indicator = 1), and A0t is the actual
earnings per share for the latest reported fiscal year (item FY0A, measure indictor =‘EPS’). We
require both earnings forecasts and actual earnings to be denominated in US dollars (currency code
= USD). The disparity between long- and short-term earnings growth forecasts, Dls, is analysts’
consensus median forecast of the long-term earnings growth (item MEDEST, fiscal period indictor
= 0) minus the implied short-term earnings growth forecast.
At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Dls computed with analyst forecasts reported in t−1. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month t (Dls1),
from month t to t + 5 (Dls6), and from month t to t + 11 (Dls12), and the deciles are rebalanced
at the beginning of t + 1. The holding period longer than one month as in, for instance, Dls6,
means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a
different month in the prior six months. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the
monthly return of the Dls6 decile. Because the long-term growth forecast data start in December
1981, the deciles start in January 1982.
A.5.48

Dis1, Dis6, and Dis12, Dispersion in Analyst Forecasts

Following Diether, Malloy, and Scherbina (2002), we measure dispersion in analyst earnings forecasts, Dis, as the ratio of the standard deviation of earnings forecasts (IBES unadjusted file, item
STDEV) to the absolute value of the consensus mean forecast (unadjusted file, item MEANEST).
116

We use the earnings forecasts for the current fiscal year (fiscal period indicator = 1) and we require
them to be denominated in US dollars (currency code = USD). Stocks with a mean forecast of zero
are assigned to the highest dispersion group. Firms with fewer than two forecasts are excluded.
At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Dis computed with analyst
forecasts reported in month t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month
t (Dis1), from month t to t + 5 (Dis6), and from month t to t + 11 (Dis12), and the deciles are
rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period longer than one month as in Dis6
means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in
a different month in the prior six months. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as
the monthly return of the Dis6 decile. Because the analyst forecasts data start in January 1976,
the Dis portfolios start in February 1976.
A.5.49

Dlg1, Dlg6, and Dlg12, Dispersion in Analyst Long-term Growth Forecasts

Following Anderson, Ghysels, and Juergens (2005), we measure dispersion in analyst long-term
growth forecasts, Dlg, as the standard deviation of the long-term earnings growth rate forecasts from
IBES (item STDEV, fiscal period indicator = 0). Firms with fewer than two forecasts are excluded.
At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Dlg reported in month t − 1.
Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month t (Dlg1), from month t to t + 5 (Dlg6),
and from month t to t + 11 (Dlg12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1.
The holding period longer than one month as in Dlg6 means that for a given decile in each month
there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We
take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Dlg6 decile. Because
the long-term growth forecast data start in December 1981, the Dlg portfolios start in January 1982.

Following Heston and Sadka (2008), at the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles
based on various measures of past performance, including returns in month t − 12 (Ra1 ), average
returns from month t − 11 to t − 1 (Rn1 ), average returns across months t − 24, t − 36, t − 48, and
[2,5]
[2,5]
t − 60 (Ra ), average returns from month t − 60 to t − 13 except for lags 24, 36, 48, and 60 (Rn ),
[6,10]
average returns across months t − 72, t − 84, t − 96, t − 108, and t − 120 (Ra ), average returns
[6,10]
from month t − 120 to t − 61 except for lags 72, 84, 96, 108, and 120 (Rn ), average returns across
[11,15]
months t − 132, t − 144, t − 156, t − 168, and t − 180 (Ra
), average returns from month t − 180
[11,15]
to t − 121 except for lags 132, 144, 156, 168, and 180 (Rn
), average returns across months
[16,20]
t − 192, t − 204, t − 216, t − 228, and t − 240 (Ra
), average returns from month t − 240 to t − 181
[16,20]
except for lags 192, 204, 216, 228, and 240 (Rn
). Monthly decile returns are calculated for the
current month t, and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1.
A.5.51

Ob, Order backlog

At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on order backlog, Ob (Compustat
annual item OB) for the fiscal year ending in calendar year t − 1, scaled by the average of total
assets (item AT) from the fiscal years ending in t − 2 and t − 1. Firms with no order backlog are
excluded (most of them never have any order backlog). Monthly decile returns are calculated from
July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1. Because the order
backlog data start in 1970, the Ob portfolios start in July 1971.

A.6.1

Trading frictions
Me, Market Equity

Market equity, Me, is price times shares outstanding from CRSP. At the end of June of each year
t, we sort stocks into deciles based on the June-end Me. Monthly decile returns are calculated from
July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1.
A.6.2

Iv, Idiosyncratic Volatility

Following Ali, Hwang, and Trombley (2003), at the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into
deciles based on idiosyncratic volatility, Iv, which is the residual volatility from regressing a stock’s
daily excess returns on the market excess return over the prior one year from July of year t − 1 to
June of t. We require a minimum of 100 daily returns when estimating Iv. Monthly decile returns
are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced at the end of
June of year t + 1.
A.6.3

Ivff1, Ivff6, and Ivff12, Idiosyncratic Volatility per the FF 3-factor Model

Following Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006), we calculate idiosyncratic volatility relative to
the Fama-French three-factor model, Ivff, as the residual volatility from regressing a stock’s excess
returns on the Fama-French three factors. At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into
deciles based on the Ivff estimated with daily returns from month t − 1. We require a minimum of
15 daily returns. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month t (Ivff1), from month
t to t + 5 (Ivff6), and from month t to t + 11 (Ivff12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning
of month t + 1. The holding period that is longer than one month as in, for instance, Ivff6, means
that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a
different month in the prior six-month period. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns
as the monthly return of the Ivff6 decile.
A.6.4

Ivc1, Ivc6, and Ivc12, Idiosyncratic Volatility per the CAPM

We calculate idiosyncratic volatility per the CAPM, Ivc, as the residual volatility from regressing a
stock’s excess returns on the value-weighted market excess return. At the beginning of each month
t, we sort stocks into deciles based on the Ivc estimated with daily returns from month t − 1. We
require a minimum of 15 daily returns. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month
t (Ivc1), from month t to t + 5 (Ivc6), and from month t to t + 11 (Ivc12), and the deciles are
rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period that is longer than one month as
in, for instance, Ivc6, means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each
of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month period. We take the simple average
of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Ivc6 decile.
A.6.5

Ivq1, Ivq6, and Ivq12, Idiosyncratic Volatility per the q-factor Model

We calculate idiosyncratic volatility per the q-factor model, Ivq, as the residual volatility from
regressing a stock’s excess returns on the q-factors. At the beginning of each month t, we sort
stocks into deciles based on the Ivq estimated with daily returns from month t − 1. We require a
minimum of 15 daily returns. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month t (Ivq1),
from month t to t + 5 (Ivq6), and from month t to t + 11 (Ivq12), and the deciles are rebalanced
118

at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period that is longer than one month as in, for
instance, Ivq6, means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which
is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month period. We take the simple average of the
subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Ivq6 decile. Because the q-factors start in January
1967, the Ivq portfolios start in February 1967.
A.6.6

Tv1, Tv6, and Tv12, Total Volatility

Following Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006), at the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks
into deciles based on total volatility, Tv, estimated as the volatility of a stock’s daily returns from
month t − 1. We require a minimum of 15 daily returns. Monthly decile returns are calculated for
the current month t, (Tv1), from month t to t + 5 (Tv6), and from month t to t + 11 (Tv12), and
the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period that is longer than
one month as in, for instance, Tv6, means that for a given decile in each month there exist six
subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month period. We take
the simple average of the subdeciles returns as the monthly return of the Tv6 decile.
A.6.7

Sv1, Sv6, and Sv12, Systematic Volatility Risk

Following Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006), we measure systematic volatility risk, Sv, as
β idVXO from the bivariate regression:
rdi = β i0 + β iMKT MKTd + β idVXO dVXOd + ǫid ,

(A34)

in which rdi is stock i’s excess return on day d, MKTd is the market factor return, and dVXOd is the
aggregate volatility shock measured as the daily change in the Chicago Board Options Exchange
S&P 100 volatility index (VXO). At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based
on β idVXO estimated with the daily returns from month t − 1. We require a minimum of 15 daily
returns. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month t (Sv1), from month t to t + 5
(Sv6), and from month t to t + 11 (Sv12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month
t + 1. The holding period that is longer than one month as in Sv6 means that for a given decile in
each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior
six-month period. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the
Sv6 decile. Because the VXO data start in January 1986, the Sv portfolios start in February 1986.
A.6.8

β1, β6, and β12, Market Beta

At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles on their market beta, β, which is
estimated with monthly returns from month t − 60 to t − 1. We require a minimum of 24 monthly
returns. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month t (β1), from month t to t + 5
(β6), and from month t to t + 11 (β12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month
t + 1. The holding period longer than one month as in β6 means that for a given decile in each
month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six
months. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the β6 decile.
A.6.9

β FP 1, β FP 6, and β FP 12, The Frazzini-Pedersen Beta

Following Frazzini and Pedersen (2013), we estimate the market beta for stock i, β FP , as ρ̂σ̂ i /σ̂ m ,
in which σ̂ i and σ̂ m are the estimated return volatilities for the stock and the market, and ρ̂ is their
119

return correlation. To estimate return volatilities, we compute the standard deviations of daily
log returns over a one-year rolling window (with at least 120P
daily returns). To estimate return
2
3d =
i
correlations, we use overlapping three-day log returns, rit
k=0 log(1 + rt+k ), over a five-year
rolling window (with at least 750 daily returns). At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks
into deciles based on β FP estimated at the end of month t−1. Monthly decile returns are calculated
for the current month t (β FP 1), from month t to t + 5 (β FP 6), and from month t to t + 11 (β FP 12),
and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period longer than one
month as in β FP 6 means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of
which is initiated in a different month in the prior six-month period. We take the simple average
of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the β FP 6 decile.
A.6.10

β D 1, β D 6, and β D 12, The Dimson Beta

Following Dimson (1979), we use the lead and the lag of the market return along with the current
market return, when estimating the market beta:
rid − rf d = αi + β i1 (rmd−1 − rf d−1 ) + β i2 (rmd − rf d ) + β i3 (rmd+1 − rf d+1 ) + ǫid ,

(A35)

in which rid is stock i’s return on day d, rmd is the market return, and rf d is the risk-free rate. The
Dimson beta of stock i, β D , is calculated as β̂ i1 + β̂ i2 + β̂ i3 . At the beginning of each month t, we
sort stocks into deciles based on β D estimated with the daily returns from month t−1. We require a
minimum of 15 daily returns. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month t (β D 1),
from month t to t + 5 (β D 6), and from month t to t + 11 (β D 12), and the deciles are rebalanced
at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period longer than one month as in β D 6 means that
for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different
month in the prior six-month period. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the
monthly return of the β D 6 decile.
A.6.11

Tur1, Tur6, and Tur12, Share Turnover

Following Datar, Naik, and Radcliffe (1998), we calculate a stock’s share turnover, Tur, as its average daily share turnover over the prior six months. We require a minimum of 50 daily observations.
Daily turnover is the number of shares traded on a given day divided by the number of shares
outstanding on that day.7 At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on
Tur over the prior six months from t − 6 to t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the
current month t (Tur1), from month t to t + 5 (Tur6), and from month t to t + 11 (Tur12), and the
deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period longer than one month
as in, for instance, Tur6, means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles,
7

We adjust the NASDAQ trading volume to account for the institutional differences between NASDAQ and
NYSE-Amex volumes (Gao and Ritter 2010). Prior to February 1, 2001, we divide NASDAQ volume by two. This
procedure adjusts for the practice of counting as trades both trades with market makers and trades among market
makers. On February 1, 2001, according to the director of research of NASDAQ and Frank Hathaway (the chief
economist of NASDAQ), a “riskless principal” rule goes into effect and results in a reduction of approximately 10% in
reported volume. From February 1, 2001 to December 31, 2001, we thus divide NASDAQ volume by 1.8. During 2002,
securities firms began to charge institutional investors commissions on NASDAQ trades, rather than the prior practice
of marking up or down the net price. This practice results in a further reduction in reported volume of approximately
10%. For 2002 and 2003, we divide NASDAQ volume by 1.6. For 2004 and later years, in which the volume of
NASDAQ (and NYSE) stocks has mostly been occurring on crossing networks and other venues, we use a divisor of 1.0.

120

each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take the simple average
of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Tur6 decile.
A.6.12

Cvt1, Cvt6, and Cvt12, Coefficient of Variation of Share Turnover

Following Chordia, Subrahmanyam, and Anshuman (2001), we calculate a stock’s coefficient of
variation (the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean) for its daily share turnover, Cvt, over
the prior six months. We require a minimum of 50 daily observations. Daily turnover is the number of shares traded on a given day divided by the number of shares outstanding on that day. We
adjust the trading volume of NASDAQ stocks per Gao and Ritter (2010) (see footnote 7). At the
beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Cvt over the prior six months from
t − 6 to t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month t (Cvt1), from month t
to t + 5 (Cvt6), and from month t to t + 11 (Cvt12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning
of month t + 1. The holding period longer than one month as in, for instance, Cvt6, means that
for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different
month in the prior six months. We take the simple average of the subdeciles returns as the monthly
return of the Cvt6 decile.
A.6.13

Dtv1, Dtv6, and Dtv12, Dollar Trading Volume

At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on their average daily dollar
trading volume, Dtv, over the prior six months from t−6 to t−1. We require a minimum of 50 daily
observations. Dollar trading volume is share price times the number of shares traded. We adjust
the trading volume of NASDAQ stocks per Gao and Ritter (2010) (see footnote 7). Monthly decile
returns are calculated for the current month t (Dtv1), from month t to t+5 (Dtv6), and from month
t to t + 11 (Dtv12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding
period longer than one month as in, for instance, Dtv6, means that for a given decile in each month
there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months.
We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Dtv6 decile.
A.6.14

Cvd1, Cvd6, and Cvd12, Coefficient of Variation of Dollar Trading Volume

Following Chordia, Subrahmanyam, and Anshuman (2001), we calculate a stock’s coefficient of
variation (the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean) for its daily dollar trading volume, Cvd,
over the prior six months. We require a minimum of 50 daily observations. Dollar trading volume is
share price times the number of shares. We adjust the trading volume of NASDAQ stocks per Gao
and Ritter (2010) (see footnote 7). At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles
based on Cvd over the prior six months from t − 6 to t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated
for the current month t (Cvd1), from month t to t + 5 (Cvd6), and from month t to t + 11 (Cvd12),
and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period longer than
one month as in Cvd6 means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each
of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take the simple average of
the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Cvd6 decile.
A.6.15

Pps1, Pps6, and Pps12, Share Price

At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on share price, Pps, at the
end of month t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month t (Pps1), from

121

month t to t + 5 (Pps6), and from month t to t + 11 (Pps12), and the deciles are rebalanced at
the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period longer than one month as in, for instance, Pps6,
means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in
a different month in the prior six months. We take the simple average of the subdeciles returns as
the monthly return of the Pps6 decile.
A.6.16

Ami1, Ami6, and Ami12, Absolute Return-to-volume

We calculate the Amihud (2002) illiquidity measure, Ami, as the ratio of absolute daily stock return
to daily dollar trading volume, averaged over the prior six months. We require a minimum of 50
daily observations. Dollar trading volume is share price times the number of shares traded. We
adjust the trading volume of NASDAQ stocks per Gao and Ritter (2010) (see footnote 7). At the
beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Ami over the prior six months
from t − 6 to t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month t (Ami1), from
month t to t + 5 (Ami6), and from month t to t + 11 (Ami12), and the deciles are rebalanced at
the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period longer than one month as in, for instance, Ami6,
means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in
a different month in the prior six months. We take the simple average of the subdeciles returns as
the monthly return of the Ami6 decile.
A.6.17

Lm1 1, Lm1 6, Lm1 12, Lm6 1, Lm6 6, Lm6 12, Lm12 1, Lm12 6, Lm12 12, Turnoveradjusted Number of Zero Daily Volume

Following Liu (2006), we calculate the standardized turnover-adjusted number of zero daily trading
volume over the prior x month, Lmx , as follows:


21x
1/(x−month TO)
x
, (A36)
Lm ≡ Number of zero daily volume in prior x months +
Deflator
NoTD
in which x-month TO is the sum of daily turnover over the prior x months (x = 1, 6, and 12). Daily
turnover is the number of shares traded on a given day divided by the number of shares outstanding
on that day. We adjust the trading volume of NASDAQ stocks per Gao and Ritter (2010) (see
footnote 7). NoTD is the total number of trading days over the prior x months. We set the deflator
to max{1/(x−month TO)} + 1, in which the maximization is taken across all sample stocks each
month. Our choice of the deflator ensures that (1/(x−month TO))/Deflator is between zero and
one for all stocks. We require a minimum of 15 daily turnover observations when estimating Lm1 ,
50 for Lm6 , and 100 for Lm12 .
At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Lmx , with x = 1, 6, and
12. We calculate decile returns for the current month t (Lmx 1), from month t to t + 5 (Lmx 6),
and from month t to t + 11 (Lmx 12). The deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1.
The holding period longer than one month as in Lmx 6 means that for a given decile in each month
there exist six subdeciles, each initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take the
simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Lmx 6 decile.
A.6.18

Mdr1, Mdr6, and Mdr12, Maximum Daily Return

At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on maximal daily return, Mdr,
in month t − 1. We require a minimum of 15 daily returns. Monthly decile returns are calculated
122

for the current month t (Mdr1), from month t to t + 5 (Mdr6), and from month t to t + 11 (Mdr12),
and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period longer than
one month as in, for instance, Mdr6, means that for a given decile in each month there exist six
subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take the
simple average of the subdeciles returns as the monthly return of the Mdr6 decile.
A.6.19

Ts1, Ts6, and Ts12, Total Skewness

At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on total skewness, Ts, calculated
with daily returns from month t − 1. We require a minimum of 15 daily returns. Monthly decile
returns are calculated for the current month t (Ts1), from month t to t + 5 (Ts6), and from month
t to t + 11 (Ts12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding
period longer than one month as in Ts6 means that for a given decile in each month there exist
six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take the
simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Ts6 decile.
A.6.20

Isc1, Isc6, and Isc12, Idiosyncratic Skewness per the CAPM

At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on idiosyncratic skewness, Isc,
calculated as the skewness of the residuals from regressing a stock’s excess return on the market
excess return using daily observations from month t − 1. We require a minimum of 15 daily returns.
Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month t (Isc1), from month t to t + 5 (Isc6),
and from month t to t + 11 (Isc12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1.
The holding period longer than one month as in Isc6 means that for a given decile in each month
there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months.
We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Isc6 decile.
A.6.21

Isff1, Isff6, and Isff12, Idiosyncratic Skewness per the FF 3-factor Model

At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on idiosyncratic skewness, Isff,
calculated as the skewness of the residuals from regressing a stock’s excess return on the FamaFrench three factors using daily observations from month t − 1. We require a minimum of 15 daily
returns. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month t (Isff1), from month t to
t + 5 (Isff6), and from month t to t + 11 (Isff12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of
month t + 1. The holding period longer than one month as in Isff6 means that for a given decile in
each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six
months. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Isff6 decile.
A.6.22

Isq1, Isq6, and Isq12, Idiosyncratic Skewness per the q-factor Model

At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on idiosyncratic skewness, Isq,
calculated as the skewness of the residuals from regressing a stock’s excess return on the q-factors
using daily observations from month t − 1. We require a minimum of 15 daily returns. Monthly
decile returns are calculated for the current month t (Isq1), from month t to t + 5 (Isq6), and from
month t to t + 11 (Isq12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The
holding period longer than one month as in Isq6 means that for a given decile in each month there
exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take

123

the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Isq6 decile. Because the
q-factors start in January 1967, the Ivq portfolios start in February 1967.
A.6.23

Cs1, Cs6, and Cs12, Coskewness

Following Harvey and Siddique (2000), we measure coskewness, Cs, as:
E[ǫi ǫ2m ]
Cs = q
,
E[ǫ2i ]E[ǫ2m ]

(A37)

in which ǫi is the residual from regressing stock i’s excess return on the market excess return, and
ǫm is the demeaned market excess return. At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into
deciles based on Cs calculated with daily returns from month t − 1. We require a minimum of 15
daily returns. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month t (Cs1), from month t to
t + 5 (Cs6), and from month t to t + 11 (Cs12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of
month t + 1. The holding period longer than one month as in Cs6 means that for a given decile in
each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six
months. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Cs6 decile.
A.6.24

Srev, Short-term Reversal

At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into short-term reversal (Srev) deciles based on
the return in month t − 1. To be included in a decile in month t, a stock must have a valid price
at the end of month t − 2 and a valid return for month t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated
for the current month t, and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1.
A.6.25

β − 1, β − 6, and β − 12, Downside Beta

Following Ang, Chen, and Xing (2006), we define downside beta, β − , as:
β− =

Cov(ri , rm |rm < µm )
,
Var(rm |rm < µm )

(A38)

in which ri is stock i’s excess return rm is the market excess return, and µm is the average market
excess return. At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on β − , which
is estimated with daily returns from prior 12 months from t − 12 to t − 1 (we only use daily observations with rm < µm ). We require a minimum of 50 daily returns. Monthly decile returns are
calculated for the current month t (β − 1), from month t to t + 5 (β − 6), and from month t to t + 11
(β − 12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period longer
than one month as in β − 6 means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles,
each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take the simple average
of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the β − 6 decile.

124

A.6.26

Tail1, Tail6, and Tail12, Tail Risk

Following Kelly and Jiang (2014), we estimate common tail risk, λt , by pooling daily returns for
all stocks in month t, as follows:
Kt
1 X
Rkt
λt =
,
(A39)
log
Kt
µt
k=1

in which µt is the fifth percentile of all daily returns in month t, Rkt is the kth daily return that is
below µt , and Kt is the total number of daily returns that are below µt . At the beginning of each
month t, we split stocks on tail risk, Tail, estimated as the slope from regressing a stock’s excess
returns on one-month-lagged common tail risk over the most recent 120 months from t−120 to t−1.
We require a minimum of least 36 monthly observations. Monthly decile returns are calculated for
the current month t (Tail1), from month t to t + 5 (Tail6), and from month t to t + 11 (Tail12),
and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period longer than
one month as in Tail6 means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each
of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take the simple average of
the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Tail6 decile.

β net 1, β net 6, and β net 12, Liquidity Betas (Return-return, Illiquidity-illiquidity,
Return-illiquidity, Illiquidity-return, and Net)

Following Acharya and Pedersen (2005), we measure illiquidity using the Amihud (2002) measure,
Ami. For stock i in month t, Amiit is the average ratio of absolute daily return to daily dollar
trading volume. We require a minimum of 15 daily observations. Dollar trading volume is share
price times the number of shares traded. We adjust the trading volume of NASDAQ stocks per Gao
and Ritter (2010) (see footnote 7). The Market illiquidity, AmiM
t , is the value-weighted average
M )), in which P M is the ratio of the total market capitalization
of min(Amiit , (30 − 0.25)/(0.30Pt−1
t−1
of S&P 500 at the end of month t − 1 to its value at the end of July 1962. We measure market
illiquidity innovations, ǫcM t , as the residual from the regression below:
M

M
M
M
c
(0.25+0.30Ami M
t Pt−1 ) = a0 +a1 (0.25+0.30Ami t−1 Pt−1 )+a2 (0.25+0.30Ami t−2 Pt−1 )+ǫM t (A40)

Innovations to individual stocks’ illiquidity, ǫcit , are measured analogously by replacing AmiM with
M )) in equation (A40). Finally, innovations to the market return are
min(Amiit , (30 − 0.25)/(0.30Pt−1
r
measured as the residual, ǫM t , from the second-order autoregression of the market return. Following
Acharya and Pedersen, we define five measures of liquidity betas:

At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks, separately, on β ret , β lcc , β lrc, β lcr , and β net ,
estimated with the past 60 months (at least 24 months) from t − 60 to t − 1. Monthly decile returns
are calculated for the current month t (β ret 1, β lcc 1, β lrc1, β lcr 1, and β net 1), from month t to t + 5
(β ret 6, β lcc 6, β lrc 6, β lcr 6, and β net 6), and from month t to t + 11 (β ret 12, β lcc 12, β lrc12, β lcr 12, and
β net 12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period longer
than one month as in β lcc 6 means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles,
each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take the simple average
of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the β lcc 6 decile.

Shl1, Shl6, and Shl12, The High-low Bid-ask Spread Estimator

The monthly Corwin and Shultz (2012) stock-level bid-ask spread estimator, Shl, are obtained from
Shane Corwin’s Web site. At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Shl
for month t − 1. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month t (Shl1), from month t
to t + 5 (Shl6), and from month t to t + 11 (Shl12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning
of month t+1. The holding period longer than one month as in Shl6 means that for a given decile in
each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six
months. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Shl6 decile.

Sba1, Sba6, and Sba12, Bid-ask Spread

The monthly Hou and Loh (2015) stock-level bid-ask spread, Sba, are provided by Roger Loh for
the sample period from 1984 to 2012 (excluding 1986 due to missing data). At the beginning of
each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on Sba for month t − 1. Monthly decile returns are
calculated for the current month t (Sba1), from month t to t + 5 (Sba6), and from month t to t + 11
(Sba12), and the deciles are rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period longer
than one month as in Sba6 means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles,
each of which is initiated in a different month in the prior six months. We take the simple average
of the subdecile returns as the monthly return of the Sba6 decile. The sample period for the Sba
portfolios is from February 1984 to January 2013 (excluding February 1986 to January 1987).

β Lev 1, β Lev 6, and β Lev 12, The Leverage Beta

At the beginning of each quarter, we estimate a stock’s financial intermediary leverage beta, β Lev ,
from regressing its quarterly returns in excess of the three-month Treasury bill rate on the quarterly non-traded leverage factor during the past 40 quarters (20 quarters minimum). Following
Adrian, Etula, and Muir (2014), we construct the leverage of financial intermediary using quarterly
aggregate data on total financial assets and liabilities of security broker-dealers from Table L.129
of the Federal Reserve Flow of Funds. To be consistent with the original data used by Adrian et
al., we combine the repurchase agreement (repo) liabilities and the reverse repo assets into net repo
liabilities. The financial intermediary leverage is measured as total financial assets/(total financial
assets − total financial liabilities). The non-traded leverage factor is the seasonally adjusted log
change in the level of leverage. The log changes are seasonally adjusted using quarterly seasonal
dummies in expanding window regressions. Following Adrian et al., we start using the security
broker-dealer data in the first quarter of 1968. The three-month Treasury bill rate data are from
the Federal Reserve Bank database.
At the beginning of each month t, we sort stocks into deciles based on β Lev estimated at the
beginning of the current quarter. Monthly decile returns are calculated for the current month t

(β Lev 1), from month t to t + 5 (β Lev 6), and from month t to t + 11 (β Lev 12), and the deciles are
rebalanced at the beginning of month t + 1. The holding period longer than one month as in β Lev 6
means that for a given decile in each month there exist six subdeciles, each of which is initiated in
a different month in the prior six months. We take the simple average of the subdecile returns as
the monthly return of the β Lev 6 decile. Because the financial intermediary leverage data start in
1968 and we need at least 20 quarters to estimate β Lev , the β Lev portfolios start in January 1973.

Delisting Adjustment

Following Beaver, McNichols, and Price (2007), we adjust monthly stock returns for delisting returns by compounding returns in the month before delisting with delisting returns from CRSP.
As discussed in Beaver, McNichols, and Price (2007), the monthly CRSP delisting returns (file
msedelist) might not adjust for delisting properly. We follow their procedure to directly construct
the delisting-adjusted monthly stock returns. For delisting that occurs before the last trading day
in month t, we calculate the delisting-adjusted monthly return, DRt , as:
DRt = (1 + pmrdt )(1 + derdt ) − 1,

(B1)

in which pmrdt is the partial month return from the beginning of the month to the delisting day
d, and derdt is the delisting event return from the daily CRSP delisting file (dsedelist).
We calculate the partial month return, pmrdt , as follows:
• When the delisting date (item DLSTDT) is the same as the delisting payment date (item
DLPDT), the monthly CRSP delisting return, mdrt , includes only the partial month return:
pmrdt = mdrt .

(B2)

• When the delisting date proceeds the delisting payment date, pmrdt can be computed from
the monthly CRSP delisting return and the delisting event return:
pmrdt =

1 + mdrt
− 1.
1 + derdt

(B3)

• If pmrdt cannot be computed via the above methods, we construct it by accumulating daily
returns from the beginning of month t to the delisting day d:
pmrdt =

d
Y
(1 + retit ) − 1,

(B4)

i=1

in which retit is the regular stock return on day i.
For delisting that occurs on the last trading day of month t, we include only the regular monthly
return for month t, and account for the delisting return at the beginning of the following month:
DRt = rett and DRt+1 = derdt , in which rett is the regular full month return. Differing from
Beaver, McNichols, and Price (2007), we do not account for these last-day delistings in the same
month, because delisting generally occurs after the market closes. Also, delisting events are often

127

surprises, and their payoffs cannot be determined immediately (Shumway 1997). As such, it might
be problematic to incorporate delisting returns immediately on the last trading date in month t.
When delisting event returns are missing, the delisting-adjusted monthly returns cannot be
computed. Among nonfinancial firms traded on NYSE, Amex, and Nasdaq, there are 16,326 delistings from 1925 to 2014, with 85.8% of the delisting event returns available. One option is to exclude
missing delisting returns. However, previous studies show that omitting these stocks can introduce
significant biases in asset pricing tests (Shumway 1997, Shumway and Warther 1999). As such, we
replace missing delisting event returns using the average available delisting returns with the same
stock exchange and delisting type (one-digit delisting code) during the past 60 months. We condition on stock exchange and delisting type because average delisting returns vary significantly across
exchanges and delisting types. We also allow replacement values to vary over time because average
delisting returns can vary greatly over time. Our procedure is inspired by prior studies. Shumway
(1997) proposes a constant replacement value of −30% for all performance-related delistings on
NYSE/Amex. Beaver, McNichols, and Price (2007) construct replacement values conditional on
stock exchange and delisting type, but do not allow the replacement values to vary over time.
