We find evidence reporting (or  file drawer') bias in the estimates and, after due account is taken of this bias, we find that differences due to estimation method are much smaller than is sometimes reported, although some are statistically significant.  We also find that estimated returns are higher in the U.S. and they have increased in the last two decades.\n\n",
