On the Rand: Determinants of the South African Exchange Rate
Jeffrey Frankel
NBER Working Paper No. 13050
April 2007
JEL No. F31
ABSTRACT
This paper is an econometric investigation of the determinants of the real value of the South African
rand over the period 1984-2006. The results show a relatively good fit. As so often with exchange
rate equations, there is substantial weight on the lagged exchange rate, which can be attributed to a
momentum component. Nevertheless, economic fundamentals are significant and important. This
is especially true of an index of the real prices of South African mineral commodities, which even
drives out real income as a significant determinant of the rand's value. An implication is that the 2003-2006
real appreciation can be attributed to the Dutch Disease. In other respects, the rand behaves like
currencies of industrialized countries with well-developed financial markets. In particular, high South
African interest rates raise international demand for the rand and lead to real appreciation, controlling
for a forward-looking measure of expected inflation and a measure of default risk or country risk.
It is in the latter respects, in particular, that the paper hopes to have improved on earlier studies of
the rand.

On the Rand: Determinants of the South African Exchange Rate

The rand has undergone large movements in recent years.
swings? Important questions include:

What explains these

•

Is the rand a commodity currency, like the Australian and Canadian dollar are said
to be (to pick two floaters)? That is, is it a currency that appreciates when prices
of the mineral products that it produces are strong on world markets and
depreciates when they are weak?

•

In other respects, does the rand behave like currencies of industrialized countries,
in light of its developed financial markets? (South Africa borrows in rand, for
example, unlike most developing countries.) This does not necessarily mean
fitting standard theories closely, as those theories don’t work well in practice for
major industrialized currencies either. But such variables as GDP and rates of
return should have an effect.

•

Did the removal of capital controls in 1995, or other elements of the transition to
democracy, cause a structural break in the determinants of the real exchange rate?

•

Has there been an element of momentum to some recent movements, or can they
be explained by fundamentals?

Figure 1 suggests that there has been a relationship between the real mineral price and
real exchange rate: the currency slumps when mineral exports are declining, as in the late
1990s, but appreciates in natural resource booms as in 2002-2006 -- the classic Dutch
Disease. But figure 2 shows that the real exchange rate has the same correlation with
relative real output, which could be explained either as a reflection of the BalassaSamuelson effect (wherein productivity growth increases the price of nontraded goods
relative to traded goods) or as a reflection of monetary theories of the nominal exchange
rate (wherein growth in real income raises the demand for money and appreciates the
currency nominally). We may have some trouble distinguishing the effect of mineral
prices from the effect of real output, because the two are themselves highly correlated, as
Figure 3 shows.

Figure 3: Real mineral price index and relative GDP

Theoretical basis of model
Here we focus on the determination of the real exchange rate, while recognizing
that monetary factors are important.1 Our model of the real exchange rate divides its
determinants into two categories, determinants of the long-run equilibrium exchange rate,
and deviations of the current real exchange rate from its long-run equilibrium.
The long run equilibrium real exchange rate is given by a version of PPP:
EP *
Q≡
, or in log form: q = s + p * − p .
(1)
P
where s ≡ log of the nominal spot exchange rate, in rand per dollars.
p ≡ log of the South African price level (probably a PPI or the GDP deflator)
p* ≡ log of the foreign (here US) price level.

But we define the price indices at home and abroad as Cobb Douglas functions of
traded goods TG and non-traded goods NTG:
(2)
p = α pNTGSA + (1-α) pTGSA ,
where α is the weight placed on NonTraded Goods in the basket .
For simplicity we assume the same weights in the foreign country.
(3)
p* = α pNTGUS + (1-α) pTGUS .
Combining (1), (2) and (3),
q = s + p * − p = s + [α pNTGUS + (1-α) pTGUS ] – [ α pNTGSA + (1-α) pTGSA ].
= (s + pTGUS - pTGSA) + α [(pNTGUS - pTGUS ) - ( pNTGSA - pTGSA )].
(4)

As Aron, Elbadawi and Kahn (2000). Chinn (1999) estimated a monetary model of the
nominal rand exchange rate. Results for both the nominal and real rates were reported in
Frankel (2006), an earlier version of the present paper.

4

The first term can be interpreted as the terms of trade, the relative price of the
traded goods produced in the foreign basket in terms of traded goods produced at home.
Our measure is the real price of the basket of mineral commoditiess that South Africa’s
most important exports, rmp in log form. Among those who have found mineral prices
or the terms of trade to be an important determinant of the value of the rand are Aron,
Elbadawi, and Kahn (2000), MacDonald and Ricci (2004), Mtonga (2006), Ngandu
(2005), Ricci (2005), and Stokke (2006).
The second term is the relative price of nontraded goods in terms of traded goods,
abroad versus at home, with weight α.. Real appreciation occurs when the relative price
of nontraded goods rises more rapidly in the domestic country than in the former country.
According to the well-known Balassa-Samuelson relationship, this in turn happens when
the rate of growth in productivity and income per capita is higher at home than abroad
(because the productivity growth tends to be concentrated in the traded goods sector,
where prices are tied to world prices by arbitrage).
Thus (pNTGUS - pTGUS )= β(income per cap) US and ( pNTGSA - pTGSA )= β(income per cap) SA.
(One could easily add an appendix deriving these relationships.) Thus
q t = μ rmpt + α β [(income per cap) US - (income per cap) SA] t .
(5)
We will be including both variables, the real price of South African minerals and relative
income per capita in the regression equation.
We turn now to the substantial short-term deviations, (q- q )t , that real exchange
rates experience relative to their long-run equilibrium value ( q )t . The idea is that such
deviations arise routinely, but that they can be expected to correct themselves gradually
over time, for example as sticky goods prices adjust. Assume that speculators form
expectations according to the regressive specification, with the addition of a possible
bubble component:
E t Δq = - θ (q t - q t) + δ q t-1
(6)
E t Δs = - θ (q t - q t) + E t Δp – EΔ p* t + δ q t-1
where E t Δq is defined to be the expectation formed at time t of real depreciation over
the coming period, and analogously for nominal depreciation and inflation, θ is the
expected speed of regression toward the long run equilibrium, the speed with which
deviations are thought to be corrected; and δ q t is the possible bubble component.2
2

Regressive expectations is of course the formulation in the classic Dornbusch (1976)
overshooting model, in which this functional form for expectations is shown to be rational for the
right value of θ as a result of gradual adjustment of p . Frankel and Froot (1987) offered
evidence from survey data that expectations at the one-year horizon do indeed encompass such
regressive behavior. Rationales for the addition of the term δ q t go back to the bubble literature
of the late 1980s, e.g., the “dragging anchor” in Goodhart (1985) or the “overshooting of the
overshooting equilibrium” in Frankel and Froot (1990). Some think that bandwagons or bubbles
may have affected the rand at some points (e.g., the sharp fall in 2002). In any case, whatever
the rationale, many authors, of which Mark (1995) is perhaps the best-known, have found
empirically that an equation that includes the lagged exchange rate together with current
fundamentals performs better than either fundamentals alone or the lagged rate alone (random
walk), especially at longer horizons.

5

Assume also that uncovered interest parity holds, except for the country premium (default
risk premium) that drives a wedge between South African interest rates and foreign
interest rates, as reflected in the sovereign spread.
(7)
E t Δs = ( i SA t – i SA * t ) - (risk spread t )
Now we combine equations (6) and (7)
- θ (q t - q t) + E t Δp – EΔ p* t + δ q t-1 = ( i SA t – i SA * t ) - (risk spread t ),
and solve for the current real exchange rate :

rSA t = iSA t – Et Δp
and

Equation (9) represents our model.

Estimated equation
Our general equation to be estimated is:
Log Real value of Rand t =
α + β 1 Log Real P Minerals t + β 2 Log (SA GDP/foreign GDP) t
+ β 3 Log Rand value t-1 + β 4 Real Interest Differential t
+ β5 Country Risk Spread t + β6 trend t + u t .
•

We have tried various versions of this equation: with the value of the rand defined
bilateral against the dollar, or trade weighted.

•

Real P Mineralst is computed as a weighted average of the prices of the specific
mineral products that South Africa produces and exports. It is intended to capture
the terms of trade, and so is expressed in real form by deflating by the foreign (e.g.,
US) price level.

•

(SA GDP/foreign GDP) t often appears in nominal exchange rate equations as an
important determinant of the demand for money (domestic relative to foreign). We
are perhaps on firm ground theoretically, when seeking to explain the real exchange
rate, to invoke a Balassa-Samuelson effect, in which case real output per capita would
be the more relevant variable. In any case, it is only possible to include the GDP
variable when we are working with quarterly data; we are forced to drop it when
working with monthly data, unless we interpolate.

6

•

Log Rand Value t-1 is entered to capture the idea of a dragging anchor or momentum
elements.

•

The remaining variables capture rates of return. It is not enough simply to add
interest rates as a rate of return, and hope for a positive coefficient, because nominal
high interest rates in developing countries usually reflect expected inflation, default
risk, and devaluation risk.
o Real interest differential (nominal interest rate on rand government bonds,
minus expected inflation, minus the same for abroad) should have a positive
effect on the perceived rate of return to holding rand assets and therefore on
the value of the rand. In the past we have used the one-year lag in the
inflation rate as a simple way of capturing expected inflation. But we now
have better forward-looking measures of expected inflation, in the form of
professional forecasts in South Africa and the US : We are now using
measures of ex ante expectations: the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia
Survey of Professional Forecasters in the case of US inflation3 and formal
Bureau of Economic Research forecasts in the case of South Africa.
o A country risk premium is included to control for risk of default, or risk of
future imposition of capital controls, when looking for a positive coefficient
on the real interest differential. After all, a high interest differential does not
attract investors to the extent that it merely reflects a correspondingly high
fear of default. The preferred measure of the country risk premium is the
spread between the interest rate at which South Africa borrows when
borrowing in dollars (not rand, because we want to separate out currency risk)
and a foreign dollar interest rate of the same maturity. We have now obtained
data from the Treasury on the sovereign spread for borrowing by the South
African government in dollars.4 The series is illustrated in Figure 5. One
can see an impressive downward trend in the perceived risk of South African
debt since 2002, to well below 100 basis points in early 2006, in tandem with
some upgrades of South African debt by rating agencies.5

•

One possible rationale for including the trend term is the growing role of AIDs.
Kaufmann and Weerapana (2005) find statistical evidence that the rand reacts
adversely to news about AIDs in South Africa. They attribute the strength of the
effect to unpredictability regarding long-term business prospects.6

3

Ang, Bekaert and Wei (2005) provide support for using such survey data.
In an earlier paper we used a proxy: the spread between the corporate rand interest rate and the
government rand rate, under the theory that when default risk raises the South African government interest
rates, it raises the corporate interest rate proportionately more. But the sovereign spread is a much better
measure of country risk.
5
MacDonald and Ricci (2004), and the updated version in Ricci (2005) have a rather similar list of
variables in their equation. Perhaps our main improvements relative to their set are the expected return
variables.
6
We tried explicitly adding to the equation a measure of HIV prevalence in South Africa. It was not
statistically significant. But the data look suspicious; for example the number is only 1/1000 as late as
1990.

Results
The regression results for the nominal and real exchange rate are highly varied.
But the real commodity price index does appear generally to have the hypothesized
positive sign. The lagged endogenous variable shows up highly significant, suggesting
either a momentum/dragging anchor phenomenon, or else the omission of (serially
correlated) determinants. The Breusch-Godfrey LM Test suggests that the use of the
lagged endogenous variable does not leave in its wake much grounds for concern about
serial correlation.7
Income per capita appears with the wrong sign when the regression is run using
the real exchange rate for the entire sample period, and significantly so. (The same is
true when we include total income rather than per capita, as in old models based on the
demand for money.) If we include income per capita (or income) without the real
mineral price index, then it appears statistically significant and of the expected sign.
Evidently, and not surprisingly, real income is highly collinear with mineral prices. But
mineral prices knock out real income when they compete side-by-side. Perhaps when
we control for the exogenous supply-side influence of the world mineral prices, the
remaining variation in income captures endogenous response to fluctuations in demand,
which have negative effects on the trade balance and through this route on the value of
the currency. In any case, the results are a decisive rejection of the importance of the
Balassa-Samuelson effect in this context. If one is convinced that this conclusion is right,
then one should omit the per capita differential from the equation.
The results for the rate of return variables are important. For many emerging
markets, it is hard to find a positive effect of the interest differential on demand for the
currency, presumably because nominal interest rates in practice signal rears of inflation,
depreciation, and default, rather than high expected returns. Results that properly use the
dollar spread on South African borrowing to measure the risk premium show a highly
significant negative effect on the value of the rand, as hypothesized. The real interest
differential has the hypothesized positive effect.
The 1990s saw important structural changes in South Africa, with the transition to
democracy,8 the end of foreign sanctions, and the removal of most capital controls in
March 1995. The capital account liberalization is probably the most relevant of these
changes for the exchange rate equation. There had been a dual exchange rate system that
had separated the financial market for rand from the trade account, charging customers a
higher rand price for foreign exchange if the purpose was to acquire assets abroad.9
These structural changes provide an argument for starting the sample in 1996. Another
reason is that the sovereign spread data are only available since 1996 anyway. But we
7

Other researchers have been concerned about the possibility of a unit root, even though this is
not as likely in the real exchange as in the nominal exchange rate. MacDonald and Ricci (2004)
used the Johansen cointegration test. Du Plessis (2005) commented that the real exchange rate
was weakly exogenous in their results, and argued that they could not claim to have a model in
which the real exchange rate adjusts toward a long-term equilibrium. Macdonald and Ricci
(2005) responded that adding another six quarters of data solved the problem.
8
Aron and Elbadawi(1999) describe a sequence of capital inflows into South Africa after its
democractic elections in 1994, followed by a speculative attack in 1996.

have also continued to run some regressions over the longer sample period, in order to
maximize the number of observations. On the theory that the degree of capital mobility
increased in March 1995, we allowed for the possibility of a shift in the coefficient on the
real interest differential,10 but the variable (the differential interacted with a dummy that
takes the value of 1 post-March 1995) was not statistically significant, or even greater
than zero. We also tried estimating the post-1995 sample by itself, but the results were
unsatisfactory, perhaps because of the smaller number of observations. But extending the
sample back to the 1980s unfortunately means losing the country risk variable, since th
sovereign spread data only start in 1996.

Chinn (1999) found more support for the overshooting version of the monetary model -- where
interest rates strengthen the currency -- toward the end of his 1980-1997 sample period,
consistent with the 1995 unification of the financial and commercial exchange rates. Akinboade
and Makina (2006) test for multiple structural breaks.

How does the value of the rand compare to the equation’s prediction?
Figures 7, 8, and 9 plot the actual real value of the rand (using different price
indices) against the value predicted by the equation. In general the fit is remarkably close.
It is natural to suspect that this may be largely due to the lagged endogenous variable, in
which case the equation would not be of much use in forecasting.
Figure 10 adds a “dynamic simulation,” that is, a projected path for the last three
years of the sample based only on fundamentals. The value of QIII, 2003, is the last one
to use the actual exchange rate for the lagged endogenous variable. From then on, the
lagged prediction of the equation itself is used as the lagged endogenous variable, rather
than the actual. Nevertheless, based on fundamentals such as a rising price of minerals,
the projection predicts as strong a real appreciation of the rand through mid-2006 as did
the fitted values of the regression.
Thus the equation does not supply evidence in favor of the proposition that the
rand was undervalued (as of late 2006) when judged by its own past relationship to
economic fundamentals. But then efficiency in the financial market sense is not the
same thing as efficiency in the sense of correct signals for the allocation of resources in
the real economy.11 The speculative inflows during the recent boom in commodities and
emerging markets may be “par for the course;” but this is not inconsistent with the
proposition that crowding out of non-commodity tradables could have negative
consequences in the long run.

Data Notes
Nominal Exchange Rate (NER): is the nominal foreign exchange value of South Africa’s
currency expressed in USD per South African Rand.
Real Bilateral Exchange Rate Index: is the nominal exchange rate multiplied by the ratio of
South African price index to US price index, expressed in index form with base year 2000. Three
real exchange rate indices are constructed based on three different price indices. These are real
exchange rate index based on CPI (RERICPI), real exchange rate based on PPI (RERIPPI) and
real exchange rate based on GDP deflator (RERIGDPDEF). The three series are plotted and given
below for comparison.

Real Mineral and Metal Price Index:
The nominal weighted mineral and metal price index (WMPI) is the weighted price index of
South African major mineral and metal export commodities. Weights are derived from the
commodity’s export share in the value of total exports of South Africa. While efforts are made to
include all major commodities, some of them, such as diamond, are not included due to lack of
international price index. The commodities included and their weights are given below:

The real weighted mineral and metal price index (RWMPI) is the WMPI divided by the consumer
price index of the US.
Expected Inflation Rates: The source of US’s expected inflation rate is the Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia. The South Africa expected inflation rate is the inflation forecasts from the
macro model of South Africa’s Bureau of Economic Research, provided by Professor Ben W
Smit.

Real Interest Rate Differentials (RGBRDIF): The long term government bond yields of the US
and South Africa are obtained from the IFS, IMF database. Then respective expected inflations
are subtracted from nominal long term bond yields to get the real interest rates. The real interest
rate differential is then the difference between SA’s real government bond rate and US’s real
government bond rate.
GDP Ratios
Real and nominal GDPs are collected for South Africa and the US from IFS, IMF, and the
following ratio are calculated:
(i)
Real GDP ratio between S. Africa and the US (RGDPrat)
(ii)
Nominal GDP ratio between S. Africa and the US (NGDPrat)
(iii)
Real per capita GDP ratio between S. Africa and the US (PERGDPrat)
Quarterly per capita GDPs are calculated using quarterly real GDPs and extrapolated quarterly
population. The annual mid-year population estimates, obtained from IFS, were decomposed to
quarterly using the following formula:
Year t Q1 pop = 3/8 *(year t-1 pop)+ 5/8 *(year t pop)
Q2 pop = 1/8 *(year t-1 pop)+ 7/8 *(year t pop)
Q3 pop = 7/8 *(year t pop)+ 1/8 *(year t+1 pop)
Q4 pop = 5/8 *(year t pop)+ 3/8 *(year t+1pop)
The following Figures show how the generated quarterly per capita GDP series tracked the annual
figures obtained from the World Development Indicators, World Bank.
