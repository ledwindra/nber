ABSTRACT
We consider identification of nonparametric random utility models of multinomial choice using "micro
data," i.e., observation of the characteristics and choices of individual consumers. Our model of preferences
nests random coefficients discrete choice models widely used in practice with parametric functional
form and distributional assumptions. However, the model is nonparametric and distribution free. It
allows choice- specific unobservables, endogenous choice characteristics, unknown heteroskedasticity,
and high-dimensional correlated taste shocks. Under standard "large support" and instrumental variables
assumptions, we show identifiability of the random utility model. We demonstrate robustness of these
results to relaxation of the large support condition and show that when it is replaced with a weaker
"common choice probability" condition, the demand structure is still identified. We show that key
maintained hypotheses are testable.

Introduction

We consider identi…cation of nonparametric random utility models of multinomial choice
using “micro data,” i.e., observation of the characteristics and choices of individual consumers.

Our model of preferences nests random coe¢ cients discrete choice models widely

used in practice with parametric functional form and distributional assumptions. However,
the model is nonparametric and distribution free. It allows choice-speci…c unobservables,
endogenous choice characteristics, unknown heteroskedasticity, and high-dimensional correlated taste shocks. Under standard “large support”and instrumental variables assumptions,
we show identi…ability of the random utility model, i.e., of (i) the choice-speci…c unobservables and (ii) the joint distribution of preferences conditional on any vector of observed and
unobserved characteristics. We demonstrate robustness of these results to relaxation of the
large support condition and show that when it is replaced with a weaker “common choice
probability”condition (de…ned below), the demand structure is still identi…ed. We also show
that key maintained hypotheses are testable.
Motivating our work is the extensive use of discrete choice models of demand for di¤erentiated goods in a wide range of applied …elds of economics and related disciplines. Examples
include transportation and urban economics (e.g., Domencich and McFadden (1975)), industrial organization (e.g., Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995)), international trade (e.g.,
Goldberg (1995)), marketing (e.g., Guadagni and Little (1983)), education (e.g., Manski and
Wise (1983)), migration (e.g., Schultz (1982)), voting (e.g., Poole and Rosenthal (1985)),
and health economics (e.g., Capps, Dranove, and Satterthwaite (2003)). We focus in particular on models in the spirit of Berry (1994), Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes (1995, 2004),
Nevo (2001), Petrin (2002) and a large related literature. These models combine two essential features: heterogeneous tastes for choice characteristics, and endogeneity through
market/choice-speci…c unobservables. Although this class of models is used in a wide range
of applications, their identi…cation has not been addressed in the prior literature. Without
an understanding of the sources of identi…cation in these models, it is di¢ cult to know what
quali…cations are necessary when interpreting estimates or policy conclusions.
1

Our analysis demonstrates that with su¢ ciently rich micro data, random utility multinomial choice models featuring unobserved market/choice characteristics are identi…ed without
the parametric or distributional assumptions used in practice— typically, linear utility with
independent additive and/or multiplicative taste shocks drawn from parametrically speci…ed
distributions.

Our results may therefore lead to greater con…dence in estimates and policy

conclusions obtained in empirical work based on discrete choice models. In particular, parametric speci…cations used in estimation can often be viewed as parsimonious approximations
in …nite samples rather than as essential maintained assumptions.
primary message.

We view this as our

However, our results also suggest that with large samples even richer

speci…cations (parametric or nonparametric) of preferences might be considered in empirical
work, and our identi…cation proofs may suggest estimation approaches.
An important strategy in our work is modeling utility as a nonparametric random function of observed and unobserved characteristics. This contrasts with the usual approach
of building up randomness from random coe¢ cients and/or other taste shocks.

Our for-

mulation not only enables us to consider a very general model of preference heterogeneity,
but also leads us to focus directly on identi…cation of the conditional joint distribution of
utilities. The advantage of this approach might be unexpected: a natural intuition is that
added structure on the way randomness enters the model would aid identi…cation. However,
whereas the conditional distribution of utilities has the same dimension as the observable
conditional choice probabilities (i.e., the dimension of the choice set), even the standard linear random coe¢ cients model will involve taste shocks of larger dimension unless signi…cant
restrictions are placed on the correlation structure. Focusing directly on the joint distribution of utilities naturally leads to primitives whose dimension exactly matches the dimension
of the observables without imposing strong distributional or functional form restrictions.
A second key aspect of our work is our explicit modeling of market/choice-speci…c unobservables. Although this is standard in the applied literature, much of the prior work on
identi…cation of discrete choice models has embedded the sources of preference heterogeneity
and the sources of endogeneity in the same random variables. In applications to demand

2

estimation, an endogeneity problem typically arises because some observed choice characteristics (price being a leading example) depend on unobserved choice characteristics. For such
environments, explicitly modeling market/choice-speci…c unobservables enables one to de…ne
counterfactuals involving exogenous changes in endogenous characteristics within a model
of heteroskedastic random utilities. For example, our formulation allows characterization
of demand elasticities, which require evaluating the e¤ects of a change in price (including
resulting changes in the variance or other moments of random utilities), holding unobserved
product characteristics …xed.1
A third novel component of our work is its exploration of both identi…cation of the full
model and identi…cation of “demand,”i.e., the mapping from observed and unobserved characteristics to the vector of choice probabilities.

For many questions motivating estimation

of discrete choice models, knowledge of this demand structure su¢ ces.

Not surprisingly,

identi…cation of demand can be obtained under weaker conditions than those giving full
identi…cation of the random utility model.
Despite these di¤erences from the prior literature, we rely heavily on two standard ideas.
One is the use of variation in exogenous observables to “trace out” the distribution of unobservables. Antecedents in the discrete choice literature include Manski (1985), Matzkin
(1992, 1993), Lewbel (2000), Honoré and Lewbel (2002), and Briesch, Chintagunta, and
Matzkin (2005), among others. We show that this strategy is particularly useful in a micro
data setting, where one can exploit variation in individual-level observables within a market,
holding market-level unobservables …xed. As usual, we require the observables tracing out
the joint distribution to have dimension as large as the choice set. However, we show that the
support conditions commonly used with this strategy can be substantially relaxed without
losing identi…cation of demand.

A second standard idea is the use of exogenous variation

in choice sets to decompose variation in the distribution of utilities into the contributions
1

Although this is the type of endogeneity typically relevant to demand applications, it obviously is not
the only possibility. For example, our model typically would not be appropriate for evaluating treatment
e¤ects on multinomial outcomes when treatments depend on individual-speci…c unobservables. See Berry
and Haile (2009b) for additional discussion and examples in the context of a generalized regression model.

of observed and unobserved characteristics. This strategy has been exploited in parametric
discrete choice models by, e.g., Berry (1994) and Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes (1995, 2004).
Here we rely heavily on results from the recent literature on nonparametric identi…cation of
regression models using instrumental variables, particularly Newey and Powell (2003) and
Chernozhukov and Hansen (2005). To our knowledge, the applicability of these results to
discrete choice settings has not been previously exploited. An implication of our results is
that the primary requirement for identi…cation of demand is the availability of instruments.
As discussed below, one advantage of micro data is the variety of instruments that may be
available.
In the following section we provide some additional discussion of related literature. We
then set up the choice framework and de…ne the observables and structural features of interest in section 3. Section 4 provides an illustration of key lines of argument in a simple case:
binary choice with exogenous characteristics. Section 5 addresses full identi…cation in the
case of multinomial choice with endogeneity. There we consider two alternative instrumental variables conditions that deliver full identi…cation of the model.

In section 6 we show

identi…ability of demand under weaker support conditions and illustrate the robustness of
the full identi…cation results to the relaxation of the large support assumption (cf. Chamberlain (2010)). Section 7 discusses testable restrictions of key maintained hypotheses. In
section 8 we show how our results can be reinterpreted to show identi…cation in one type of
environment in which only market level data are available. We conclude in section 9.

Relation to the Literature

Our work is motivated by a large applied literature using models of discrete choice demand
incorporating two key components: heterogeneous preferences for choice characteristics and
endogeneity through market/choice-speci…c unobservables.

The former allows a ‡exible

model of substitution patterns (e.g., cross-elasticities),2 while the latter is essential if one

Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995). Early models of discrete choice with heterogeneous tastes for characteristics

is to control for the classical endogeneity of prices.

Although there is a large literature

on identi…cation of discrete choice models,3 there has been no analysis that covers even the
linear version of these models typically used in the applied literature. Thus, although we
relax functional form restrictions considered in the prior identi…cation literature, a more fundamental distinction is that our model allows simultaneously for heterogeneity in preferences
for choice characteristics and endogeneity through market/choice-speci…c unobservables.
Identi…cation of heterogeneous preferences for choice characteristics has been explored by
Ichimura and Thompson (1998) and Briesch, Chintagunta, and Matzkin (2005). Ichimura
and Thompson (1998) studied the linear random coe¢ cients binary choice model. Briesch,
Chintagunta, and Matzkin (2005) considered multinomial choice, allowing generalizations of
the linear random coe¢ cients model. Neither considers endogenous choice characteristics,
and both impose restrictions we do not require on how heterogeneity enters preferences.
Lewbel (2000) considered identi…cation in the semi-parametric linear random utility
model
vij = xij +
where the distribution of

ij

(1)

ij

can vary with xij . Unlike (1), our model makes a distinction

between the unobservables responsible for taste heterogeneity and those responsible for endogeneity.4

To see why this is essential in applications to discrete choice demand, suppose

we wish to describe how quantities would change in response to an exogenous change in
the price of good j— e.g., to describe own- and cross-price demand elasticities. Accounting
for heterogeneity in tastes requires that the entire distribution of vij (not just its mean)
be permitted to change with the change in price.

At the same time, controlling for the

endogeneity of price requires that all else (in particular, market/product-level unobservables
that are correlated with price) be held …xed.

Meeting both requirements is not possible

Important early work includes Manski (1985, 1987, 1988) and Matzkin (1992, 1993), who study linear
models with exogenous regressors.

We also relax functional form restrictions; for example, we do not require mean e¤ects of observables to
enter separably from unobservables.

in a model like (1) that has a single “composite” error term. Thus, while (1) provides an
attractive structure if the parameter

is the object of interest, the model lacks the structure

needed to de…ne key objects of interest in the context of discrete choice demand.
Honoré and Lewbel (2002) consider a binary panel version of the model in Lewbel (2000),
relying on linearity in a composite error term and focusing on identi…cation of a slope parameter. Altonji and Matzkin (2005) consider a similar but nonparametric model. Their
results for discrete choice models focus on identi…cation and estimation only of local average
responses. Other work considering models similar to (1) includes Hong and Tamer (2004),
Blundell and Powell (2004), Lewbel (2005), and Magnac and Maurin (2007).
Matzkin (2004) (section 5.1) considers a model incorporating choice-speci…c unobservables and an additive preference shock, but in a model without random coe¢ cients or other
sources of heteroskedasticity/heterogeneous tastes for characteristics.5

Hoderlein (2008)

allows for both heteroskedasticity and endogeneity in the case of a binary choice model,
focusing on identi…cation of a particular average derivative. Hoderlein (2008), like Blundell
and Powell (2004) and Matzkin (2004), limit attention to binary choice in semiparametric
triangular models, leading to the applicability of control function methods or the related
idea of “unobserved instruments.”6 For binary choice demand, triangular models can be
appropriate when price depends on either a demand shock or a cost shock, but not both. In
the case of multinomial choice, standard oligopoly models imply that each price depends on
the entire vector of demand shocks (and cost shocks, if any). Thus, triangular models do not
permit the type of endogeneity relevant for most applications to discrete choice demand.7
Berry and Haile (2009a) considers identi…cation of multinomial choice models allowing
heterogeneity and endogeneity, but for the case when only market level data are available.8

Gautier and Kitamura (2007) have considered binary choice in a linear random coe¢ cients environment.
They include a brief discussion of endogeneity under a triangular structure.

Berry and Haile (2009b) provide additional results for binary choice and other models that are special
cases of a “generalized regression model.”

Although the results there extend immediately to the richer micro data environment considered in the present paper, here our focus is on the gains that micro data can deliver. The lack
of micro data in Berry and Haile (2009a) makes it impossible to exploit the within-market
variation that plays a central role throughout the present paper. Consequently, the results
in Berry and Haile (2009a) require more restrictive representations of preferences than those
considered here. However, given the results on identi…cation of demand below, the results
in Berry and Haile (2009a) on identi…cation of marginal costs do extend to the micro data
environment considered here.
Our work is distinguished from much of the prior literature by a neglect of estimation.
This limited focus is shared by the concurrent work of Fox and Gandhi (2009), which explores
identi…ability of several related models, including a model of multinomial choice in which
consumer types are multinomial and utility functions are analytic. More recently, Chiappori
and Komunjer (2009) have explored identi…cation of a multinomial choice model with an
additive structure in a micro data environment, allowing for heterogeneous preferences and
endogeneity through choice-speci…c unobservables. They use a change of variables approach
more closely related to one of the approaches we have developed in Berry and Haile (2009a).

Model
Preferences and Choices

Consistent with the motivation from demand estimation, we describe the model as one in
which each consumer i in each market t chooses from a set Jt of available products. We will
use the terms “product,” “good,” and “choice” interchangeably to refer to elements of the
choice set. The term “market”is synonymous with the choice set. In particular, consumers
facing the same choice set are de…ned to be in the same market. In practice, markets will
typically be de…ned geographically and/or temporally. Variation in the choice set will of
course be essential to identi…cation, and our explicit reference to markets provides a way to
discuss this clearly.
7

Each consumer i in market t is associated with a matrix of observables zit = (zi1t ; : : : ; ziJt t ).
The j subscript on zijt allows the possibility that some characteristics are both consumer- and
choice-speci…c. This can result from interactions between consumer characteristics and product characteristics, or from measures that are inherently consumer/choice-speci…c. Examples
from the literature include interactions between family size and automobile size (Goldberg
(1995), Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (2004)), distance from an individual’s home to a hospital, school, or retailer (Capps, Dranove, and Satterthwaite (2003), Hastings, Staiger, and
Kane (2007), Burda, Harding, and Hausman (2008)), household exposure to product-speci…c
advertising (Ackerberg (2001)), matches between a voter’s position and party a¢ liation and
those of each candidate (Rivers (1988)), and matches between the income, education and
race of a household to that of a neighborhood (Bayer, Ferreira, and McMillan (2007)). We
will require one such measure for each market t and each product j

1.9

In applications to demand it is important to model consumers as having the option to
purchase none of the products the researcher focuses on.10 We represent this by choice j = 0
and assume 0 2 Jt 8t. Choice 0 is often referred to as the “outside good.” We denote the
number of “inside goods” by Jt = jJt j

If zijt = z~it for all j, the identi…cation problem is identical to that in the case of market-level data (see
Berry and Haile (2009a)) conditional on each value of z~it .

See, e.g., Bresnahan (1981), Anderson, DePalma, and Thisse (1992), Berry (1994), Berry, Levinsohn,
and Pakes (1995), and Goldberg (1995).
11

In applications with no “outside choice”our approach can be adapted by normalizing preferences relative
to those for a given choice. The same adjustment applies when characteristics of the outside good vary
across markets in observable ways.

Athey and Imbens (2007) point out that the assumption of a scalar vertical unobservable jt can lead to
testable restrictions in some models. Although their observation does not apply to our more general model,

Aside from the restriction to scalar market/choice-speci…c unobservables, our representation of preferences is so far fully general. However, all of our results will require a restriction

The invariance and separability restrictions together give zijt the properties of a “special
regressor”(e.g., Lewbel (2000)) that will provide a mapping between units of (latent) utility
and units of (observable) choice probabilities.17 Monotonicity plays important roles as well,
enabling us to map observed conditional choice probabilities to values of the market/choice
unobservables. We show in section 7 that all three restrictions have testable implications.

an observationally equivalent model with separability in zit . This is well known. Nonetheless, additive
separability is not without loss under these assumptions. This is because there may be no monotonic

This property would be preserved by any monotonic transformation but fails under separability. Thus,
although the separable structure preserves consumers’ordinal rankings of the outside good and any inside
good, it need not preserve their ordinal rankings of alternative inside goods. An implication is that there
(1)
can be simultaneous changes in zit and xt that would raise welfare under one model but lower welfare under
the other. Nonetheless, the observational equivalence demonstrates why it may be di¢ cult to obtain full
identi…cation without a restriction like the separability we assume. Note that quasilinearity also provides a
cardinal representation of utility, making it possible to characterize aggregate welfare.

Before discussing identi…cation, we must have a unique representation of preferences for
which the identi…cation question can be posed. This requires several normalizations.
First, because unobservables enter non-separably and have no natural units, we must
normalize the location and scale of

for each j.

jt

It will be useful to employ di¤erent

normalizations for di¤erent results, so we provide these below.
We must also normalize the location and scale of utilities. Without loss, we normalize
the scale of each consumer i’s utility using his marginal utility from zijt , yielding utilities
with the form
zijt +

~ j xjt ;

jt ; ! it

8i; j = 1; : : : ; J:

it

Here we include a subscript j on the function ~ j because in general we will have conditioned
(2)

on a di¤erent value of zijt for each j. Letting

j

xjt ;

jt ; ! it

=

~ j xjt ;

jt ; ! it
it

this gives the representation of preferences we will work with below:

vijt = zijt +

j

xjt ;

jt ; ! it

To normalize the location we set vi0t = 0 8i; t.

8i; j = 1; : : : ; J:

(5)

Treating the utility from the outside good

as non-stochastic is without loss, since choices are determined by di¤erences in utilities and
we have not restricted the joint distribution of utilities across products.

12

3.3

Observables and Structural Features of Interest

Each consumer i maximizes her utility, choosing good j whenever vijt > vikt 8k 2 J

fjg.

For simplicity we assume that any ties with the outside good are broken in favor of the
outside good. We denote consumer i’s choice by

yit = arg max vijt :
j2J

We will typically require excluded instruments, which we denote by w̃jt . One advantage
of micro data is the variety of instrumental variables that may be available.

Depending

on the environment, instruments for prices18 might include cost shifters excludable from the
utility function, prices in other markets (e.g., Hausman (1996), Nevo (2001)), characteristics
of competing products (e.g., Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995)), and/or “average” values
of zit in market t (e.g., Waldfogel (2003), Gentzkow and Shapiro (2009)).19

Because the

arguments are standard, we will not discuss assumptions necessary to justify the exclusion
and “rank”conditions, which we will assume directly below.
The observables then consist of the market index t and the variables

(yit ; fxjt ; w̃jt ; zijt gj2J ) :
To discuss identi…cation, we treat their joint distribution as known. In particular, we take
the conditional probabilities

pijt = PrP (yit = jjt; fxkt ; w̃kt ; zikt gk2J )

(6)

18

We discuss instruments for prices here because price is the leading case of an endogenous product characteristic. Our results permit any number/types of endogenous characteristics as long as valid instruments
are available.
19

The last of these obviously is unavailable without micro data. The analysis in Berry and Haile (2009a)
suggests that characteristics of other goods may not be su¢ cient on their own without micro data or additional restrictions on preferences. Thus the variety of instruments that may be available can be an important
advantage of micro data.

13

as known. Loosely speaking, we consider the case of observations from a large number of
markets, each with a large number of consumers, who are anonymous conditional on zit .
Our …rst objective is to derive su¢ cient conditions for identi…cation of the market/choicespeci…c unobservables and the distribution of preferences over choices in sets J , conditional
on the characteristics xjt ; zijt ;

jt j2J .

In particular, we will show identi…cation of

and the joint distribution of fvijt gj2J conditional on any xjt ; zijt ;

jt j2J

jt j2J

in their support.

These conditional distributions fully characterize the primitives of this model. We therefore
refer to identi…cation of these probability distributions as full identi…cation of the random
utility model.
We will also consider a type of partial identi…cation: identi…cation of demand. For many
economic questions motivating estimation of discrete choice demand models, the joint distribution of utilities is not needed. For example, to discuss cross-price elasticities, equilibrium
markups, or pricing/market shares under counterfactual ownership or cost structures, one
requires identi…cation of demand, not the full random utility structure. Identi…cation of
demand naturally requires less from the model and/or data than identi…cation of the distribution of preferences. Demand is fully characterized by the unobservables

jt j2J

and the

structural choice probabilities

j

fxjt ;

jt ; zijt gj2J

= Pr yit = jjfxjt ;

jt ; zijt gj2J

(7)

These conditional probabilities are not directly observable from (6) because of the unobservables

jt .

Illustration: Binary Choice with Exogeneity

To illustrate key elements of our approach, we begin with the simple case of binary choice
with exogenous xjt . Dropping the j subscripts, consumer i selects the inside good whenever

zit + (xt ; t ; ! it ) > 0:
14

Here we normalize

t

by letting it have a uniform distribution on (0; 1).

We consider

identi…cation under the following assumptions.
t

(xt ; zit ) :

j=

Assumption 1.

Assumption 2. supp zit jxt ;

t

= R 8x:

Assumption 1 merely restates that for this illustration we are considering the special
case of exogenous observables.

This assumption is dropped in the following section. A

“large support” condition like Assumption 2 is common in the literature on nonparametric
and semiparametric identi…cation of discrete choice models (e.g., Manski (1985), Matzkin
(1992), Matzkin (1993), Lewbel (2000)).20 We relax this assumption in section 6.
Here we show that Assumptions 1 and 2 are su¢ cient for full identi…cation of the random
utility model. Let

are independent conditional on t (i.e., conditional on (xt ; t )), Assumption

As usual, the support of zit need not equal the entire real line but need only cover the support of
(xt ; t ; ! it ). We will nonetheless use the real line (real hyperplane below) for simplicity of exposition.

then follows standard arguments. In particular, for

strict monotonicity of D

implies
(xt ) = D (xt ; ) :

Since
each

Thus far we have shown identi…cation of F

So for any (xt ; t )

in their support, the value of

F (rjxt ; t )

Pr ( (xt ; t ; ! it )

rjxt ; t )

(r)

is uniquely determined for all r 2 R. Since vit = zit + (xt ; t ; ! it ), this proves the following
result.
Theorem 1. Consider the binary choice setting with preferences given by (5). Under Assumptions 1 and 2, each

t

and the distribution of vit conditional on any (xt ; t ; zit ) 2

is

identi…ed.
Our argument involved two simple steps, each standard on its own. First, we showed that
variation in zit can be used to trace out the distribution of preferences across consumers. It is
in this step that the role of idiosyncratic variation in tastes is identi…ed. Antecedents for this
step include Matzkin (1992), Matzkin (1993), Lewbel (2000).21 Here we apply this step within
each market, exploiting the fact that conditioning on the market …xes all characteristics of
the choice set, even those not observed. In the second step, we use variation in choice
characteristics across markets to decompose the variation in utilities across products into
the variation due to observables and that due to the unobservables

t.

This idea has been

used extensively in estimation of parametric multinomial choice demand models following
Berry (1994), Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995), and Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (2004).
This second step is essential once we allow the possibility of endogenous choice characteristics
(e.g., correlation between price and

t ),

as will typically be necessary in demand estimation.

Our approach for the more general cases follows the same broad outline.

5

Multinomial Choice: Full Identi…cation

We now consider the general case of multinomial choice with endogenous characteristics
using the speci…cation of preferences in (5). We will use the following generalization of the
large support assumption:
Assumption 3. supp fzijt gj=1;:::;J j xjt ;

jt j=1;:::;J

= RJ :

This is a strong assumption, essentially requiring su¢ cient variation in (zi1t ; : : : ; ziJt t )
to move choice probabilities through the entire unit simplex.22

Equivalent conditions are

assumed in prior work on multinomial choice by, e.g., Matzkin (1993), Lewbel (2000), and
Briesch, Chintagunta, and Matzkin (2005). Such an assumption provides a natural benchmark for exploring identi…ability under ideal conditions.

However, we will also explore

results that do not require this assumption in section 6.
Without Assumption 1, we will require instrumental variables.
(1)

where xjt 2 RK denotes the endogenous characteristics. We then let wjt
denote the vector of exogenous conditioning variables.

(1)

(2)

Let xjt = xjt ; xjt ,
(2)

xjt ; w̃jt

We will consider two alternative

sets of instrumental variables conditions below, each taken from the recent literature on
nonparametric instrumental variables regression.
22

This is only “essentially” required by the large support condition because we do not require continuity
(1)
of choice probabilities in zit .

17

5.1

Identi…cation with Fully Independent Instruments

We …rst explore identi…cation using instrumental variables conditions from Chernozhukov
and Hansen (2005). We normalize

jt j2J

by assuming that for each j,

jt

has a uniform

(1)

marginal distribution on (0; 1). Here we will assume xjt is continuously distributed, with
(1)

(2)

(2)

conditional density function fxj xjt jwjt .23 We will condition on a value of x1t ; : : : ; xJt ,
(1)

suppress these arguments in the notation, and let xjt now denote xjt . De…ne the random
variable
jt

= Dj xjt ;

jt

med

j

xjt ;

xjt ;

(9)

jt

and let f j ( jxjt ; wjt ) denote its conditional density.
Let

and

f

be some small positive constants. For each j and

2 (0; 1) de…ne Lj ( )

as the convex hull of functions mj ( ; ) that satisfy
(a) for all wjt , Pr (

(b) for all xjt , mj (xjt ; ) 2 sj (xjt )

; +

: f j ( jxjt ; w)

]; and
f

8w with fxj (xjt jw) > 0 .

We now make the following instrumental variables assumptions, taken from Chernozhukov
and Hansen (2005, Appendix C).24
jt

(wjt ; zijt ) 8j; t:

j=

Assumption 4.

Assumption 5. For all j and

2 (0; 1), (i) for any bounded function Bj (x; ) = mj (x; )

(ii) the density f"j (ejx; w) of

jt

jt

is continuous and bounded in e over R a.s.;

(iii) Dj (xjt ; ) 2 sj (xjt ) for all xjt .
Assumption 4 is a strong exclusion restriction requiring fully independent instruments.
Assumption 5 is a particular type of “bounded completeness” condition, requiring that the
23

This could be dropped by appealing below to Theorems 2 and 3 (and the associated rank conditions)
in Chernozhukov and Hansen (2005) instead of their Theorem 4. We focus on continuous endogenous
characteristics here because price is our leading example.
24

Chernozhukov and Hansen’s “rank invariance” property holds here because the same unobservable jt
determines potential values of jt for all possible values of the endogenous characteristics.
As in their
framework, jt and xjt can be assumed without loss to be tranformed to have bounded support.

18

instruments induce su¢ cient variation in the endogenous variables. This condition plays the
role of the standard rank condition for linear models, but for the nonparametric nonseparable
model

j

= Dj (x; ).25 With these assumptions, we obtain the following result.

Theorem 2. Under the representation of preferences in (5), suppose Assumptions 3–5 hold.
Then each

jt

and the joint distribution of fvijt gj2J conditional on any (xjt ; zijt ;

jt ) j2J

in their support is identi…ed.
Proof. Let

ijt

and observe that

Thus, the left side of (9) can be treated as known for all j and t. Noting that the function

Theorem 4 of Chernozhukov and Hansen (2005)

then implies that under Assumptions 4 and 5, each function Dj (and therefore each

in their support. Since

Chernozhukov and Hansen (2005) discuss su¢ cient conditions. We also consider an alternative to Assumption 5 below.

19

vijt = zijt +

ijt ,

the result follows.

Our proof exploits the large support condition wherever possible, including in an “identi…cation at in…nity”argument (equation (10)) often employed in this literature (e.g., Matzkin
(1993)). However, we will show below that demand is identi…ed without this assumption,
and that even full identi…cation is robust to relaxation of the support assumption.26

5.2

Identi…cation with Mean-Independent Instruments

Any application of instrumental variables methods requires that the instruments induce
su¢ cient exogenous variation in the endogenous variables. Assumption 5 provides the appropriate formal condition for the model (9), and this is the same condition that has been
used to show identi…cation of nonseparable regression models. Nonetheless, a possible limitation of Theorem 2 is that Assumption 5 may be di¢ cult to check and/or interpret. Whether
there are useful su¢ cient conditions on economic primitives delivering this property is an
open question of broad interest in the literature on nonparametric instrumental variables
regression, but beyond the scope of this paper.27

However, if we are willing to impose

additional structure on the utility function, we can utilize a somewhat more intuitive suf…cient condition for full identi…cation. Doing so also enables us to relax the excludability
restriction to require only mean independence.
(2)

Conditioning on xt

as in the prior section, suppose (for this subsection only) that each

consumer i’s conditional indirect utilities can be represented as

vijt =

where
E[

it ],

it

and

it

it zijt

it jt

j = 1; : : : ; J

(13)

are strictly positive with probability one and the expectations E [

it ],

and E ~ j (xjt ; ! it ) jxjt are …nite. This imposes a restriction relative to (5) but is

26

See also Berry and Haile (2009a), which does not use an identi…cation at in…nity argument even for full
identi…cation.
27

In Berry and Haile (2009a) we explore an alternative argument relying on classical exclusion and support
conditions in an environment combining discrete choice demand with a partially speci…ed model of supply.

20

still quite general relative to the prior literature. A representation of preferences equivalent
to (13) is
vijt = zijt +

j

xjt ;

8i; j = 1; : : : ; J

jt ; ! it

(14)

where now
j

xjt ;

jt ; ! it

~ j (xjt ; ! it )

it

Here we also use a di¤erent normalization of

jt .

it

(15)

jt :

Instead of letting

jt

have a standard

uniform distribution, we make the location normalization

E

= 0 8j

jt

and scale normalization

E

(16)

= 1:

it

Both are without further loss of generality.
With this structure we can replace the full independence assumption (Assumption 4)
with mean independence.
Assumption 6. E

jt jwjt ; zijt

= 0 8j; t;wjt ; zijt .

To show identi…cation of the joint distribution of fvijt gj2J conditional on xjt ; zijt ;
…rst note that the marginal distribution of

j

xjt ;

jt ; ! it

jt j2J ,

jt for each j is identi…ed using the

same argument used in the …rst lines of the proof of Theorem 2. This implies identi…cation
of the conditional means
jt

E

j

xjt ;

jt ; ! it

t

for all j and t. With the separable structure (15) and the normalization (16), for each j and
t we have
jt

= Dj (xjt ) +

jt

for some unknown function Dj . It is then straightforward to con…rm that, under Assumption
21

6, the following “completeness”condition is necessary and su¢ cient for identi…cation of each
function Dj from observation of (

jt ; xjt ; w̃jt )

(Newey and Powell (2003)).

Assumption 7. For all j and all functions Bj (xjt ) with …nite expectation, E [Bj (xjt ) jwjt ] =
0 a.s. implies Bj (xjt ) = 0 a.s.
The completeness condition is the analog of the standard rank condition for identi…ability
in linear models.

Like the standard rank condition, completeness requires that variation
(1)

in wijt induce su¢ cient variation in xjt to distinguish the true function Dj ( ) from other
(1)

functions of xjt using the conditional mean restriction of Assumption 6.28
We can now state a second full identi…cation result for the multinomial choice model.
Theorem 3. Under the representation of preferences in (14)-(15), suppose Assumptions 3,
6 and 7 hold. Then each
(xjt ; zijt ;

jt ) j2J

jt

and the joint distribution of fvijt gj2J conditional on any

in their support are identi…ed.

Proof. From the preceding argument, under the completeness Assumption 7, we have identi…cation of each Dj and therefore of each

jt .

The remainder of the proof then follows that

of Theorem 2 exactly, beginning with (12).

6

Identi…cation of Demand Using Limited Support

The large support assumption (Assumption 3) in the preceding section is common in the
literature but is obviously strong. Although our results describe only su¢ cient conditions for
identi…ability, it should not be surprising that a large support assumption may be needed for
full identi…cation of the random utility model: if the exogenous observables can move choice
probabilities only through a subset of the unit simplex, we should only hope to identify the
joint distribution of utilities on a subset of their support.
28

Of course, one would like to

Lehman and Romano (2005) give standard su¢ cient conditions and references. See also Newey and
Powell (2003) and Severini and Tripathi (2006). If we add the assumption that E ~ j xjt ; jt jxjt is
bounded, the completeness assumption could be replaced with bounded completeness.

22

understand how heavily the results rely on the tails of the large support and what can be
learned from more limited variation. We explore these questions here.
We show that more limited variation can be su¢ cient to identify demand, i.e., to identify
the unobservables

jt

and the structural choice probabilities

j

fxjt ;

jt ; zijt gj2J

at all points

of support. We also show continuity of the identi…ed features with respect to the support of
the micro data. In particular, moving from our limited support condition to the large support
condition moves the identi…ed features of the model smoothly toward the full identi…cation
results of the preceding sections.
For multinomial choice we obtain these results under a somewhat more restrictive speci…cation of preferences than that in (5).
should be a comforting.

Up to this quali…cation, however, these results

Demand is identi…ed without the large support condition. And

although we require the large support for full identi…ability of the random utility model in
the previous section, the identi…cation is not knife-edge: the tails of the large support are
needed only to determine the tails of the joint distributions of utilities.

6.1
6.1.1

Binary Choice
Identi…cation of Demand

As before, we begin with binary choice to illustrate our main insights. We begin with the
relaxed support condition on zit . We assume existence of one “common choice probability”
that is attainable in each market t by the appropriate choice of zit .
Assumption 8. For some q 2 (0; 1), for each market t there exists a unique ztq 2supp zit
such that Pr (yit = 1jzit = ztq ) = q.
This requires su¢ cient variation in zit to push the choice probability to q in each market,
not over the whole interval (0; 1) in each market.29 This is not innocuous but is much less
demanding than the full support condition.
29

Implicitly we also require a continuous (region of) support for
of each ztq .

23

(xt ;

t ; ! i ) jxt ; t

to ensure uniqueness

Consumer i chooses the inside good if

zit + (xt ; t ; ! it ) > 0:
Under Assumption 8, for each market t we can …nd the value ztq such that
Pr (

(xt ; t ; ! it ) < zit jxt ; t ; zit )jzit =ztq = q:

Observe that each ztq is the qth quantile of the random variable

(xt ; t ; ! it ) conditional

on t, i.e., on (xt ; t ). Thus, we can write
ztq = (xt ; t ; q)
for some function ( ; q) that is strictly decreasing in

(17)

t.

This strict monotonicity is the key

idea here: holding xt …xed, markets with high values of ztq are those with low values of the
unobservable

t.

Here we will revert to the uniform normalization of

Identi…cation of the function

( ; q) ; and therefore of each

t;

t.

then follows from (17) as

in the preceding sections, using the nonparametric instrumental variables result of Chernozhukov and Hansen (2005).

This holds under the same type of bounded completeness

assumption made in section 5.1; we state this condition formally as Assumption 12 in the
Appendix.

With each

t

known, the observable choice probabilities reveal the structural

choice probabilities
(xt ; t ; zit ) = Pr (yit = 1jxt ; t ; zit )

(18)

at all points (xt ; t ; zit ) of support. This gives the following result.
Theorem 4. In the binary choice model with preferences given by (5), suppose Assumptions 4, 8, and 12 hold.

Then each

t

is identi…ed and the structural choice probabilities

(xt ; t ; zit ) are identi…ed at all points (xt ; t ; zit ) in their support.

24

6.1.2

Continuity of the Identi…ed Features

Theorem 4 required only one common choice probability. If there is more than one, each
provides additional information about the distribution of vit jxt ; zit ; t . In particular, we can
identify a function ( ; q) in (17) for each common choice probability q, each then determining
the qth quantile of

(xt ; t ; ! it ) jxt ; t . Since vit = zit +

(xt ; t ; ! it ), this determines the

corresponding quantiles of the distribution of vit conditional on (xt ; t ; zit ). In the limit—
i.e., with su¢ cient variation in zit to make every q 2 (0; 1) a common choice probability— all
quantiles of vit conditional on (xt ; t ; zit ) are identi…ed, and we are back to full identi…cation
as in Theorem 2. This illustrates the notion of continuity of the identi…ed features described
above. It also shows that we require the tails of fzijt gj2J only to identify the tails of the
conditional distributions of utilities.

6.2

Multinomial Choice

For multinomial choice we will require a di¤erent representation of preferences:30

vijt =

where each
that zijt and

j

j

zijt +

8i; j = 1; : : : ; J

jt ; xjt ; ! it

is strictly increasing in its …rst argument. This is similar to (13) in requiring
jt

be perfectly substitutable. Here we require all consumers to have the same

marginal rate of substitution (normalized to one) between zijt and
zijt +

jt

(19)

to enter the utility function in a fully nonparametric way.

the scale of each

jt

distributions of each

but not the locations. So we set E
jt

jt

jt ,

but allow the index

This restriction …xes

= 0 8j, leaving the marginal

otherwise unrestricted.

A key implication of (19) is that choice probabilities depend on the sums

ijt

zijt +

30

jt

Here we focus on identi…cation of demand. Continuity of the identi…ed features can be obtained as in
the binary model if we have the separable structure zijt + jt + j (xjt ; ! it ).

25

rather than on zijt and

jt

separately. Thus, letting

t

=(

i1t ; : : : ;

iJt )

and xt = (x1t ; : : : ; xJt ),

we can write the structural choice probabilities as

j

( t ;xt ) :

For the multinomial choice model our results rely on invertibility of the mapping from
the latent indexes

t

to the market shares implied by utility maximization. To show that

this holds we require a weak notion of the choice set J being a set of substitute goods that
“belong”in the same market. To state this “connected substitutes”condition, we …rst need
a de…nition.
De…nition 1. Product k substitutes to product ` at (
in

t ; xt )

if

`

( t ; xt ) is strictly decreasing

31
ikt .

This de…nition provides a natural directional notion of one product’s being a substitute
for another. For example, if a reduction in

kt

leads (all else equal) to a larger market share

for product `, we say that product k substitutes to product `.
Given any values of ( t ; xt ), let

(J ) denote the (J + 1)

ones, with the (r; c) element equal to one if product (r

(J + 1) matrix of zeros and

1) substitutes to product (c

1) at

( t ; xt ). We will assume that the products j 2 J all belong in the same choice set in the
following sense.
Assumption 9 (“Connected Substitutes”). At any ( t ;xt ) such that (
is on the interior of 4J , the directed graph of
The directed graph of

( t ;xt ) ; : : : ;

J

( t ;xt ))

(J ) is strongly connected.

(J ) has nodes (vertices) representing each product and an edge

from product k to product ` whenever product k substitutes to product `.32 The “connected
substitutes” condition requires that this graph include a directed path from every product
31

Because we introduce this de…nition after normalizing the utility of the outside good to zero, we de…ne
an increase in i0t to mean equal reductions in ijt for all j > 0. Thus product 0 substitutes to product j
if the probability good j is chosen goes up whenever ikt increases by an equal amount for all k > 0:
32

In standard models
directional.

(J ) will typically be symmetric, so the edges of its directed graph will be bi-

26

j 2 J to every other product j 0 2 J . Of course, the path between j and j 0 may be through
other nodes. Thus, for example, even a market with two independent goods satis…es this
condition if both substitute to and from the outside good.

On the other hand, if the

connected substitutes condition fails, then there is some strict subset of J that substitute
only among themselves for some values of ( t ;xt ).

In Berry and Haile (2009a) we provide

additional discussion of this condition and show that it is satis…ed in standard models. There
we also point out that this condition is equivalent to a condition used by Gandhi (2008) to
show invertibility of market shares. Using his argument, we can show the following result for
our framework, generalizing well-known invertibility results for linear discrete choice models
in Hotz and Miller (1993), Berry (1994) and Berry and Pakes (2007).33
Lemma 1. Consider any choice probability vector p = (p1 ; : : : ; pJ )0 on the interior of 4J .
Under Assumption 9, for any xt there is at most one vector

2 RJ such that

j

( ; xt ) = p j

for all j:
Proof. See Berry and Haile (2009a), Lemma 1.
Finally, we generalize the previous common choice probability assumption in the natural
way.
Assumption 10. There exists q = (q0 ; q1 ; : : : ; qJ ) on the interior of 4J such that for each
q
q
market t there is a vector ztq = (z1t

) 2supp(zi1t ; : : : ; ziJt t ) such that for all j; qj =

Pr(yit = j jx1t ; : : : ; xJt ; zi1t ; : : : ; ziJt t )zit =ztq :
Assumption 10 requires the vector (zi1t ; : : : ; ziJt ) have su¢ cient support to drive the
choice probability vector to q in each market. The value of q satisfying this condition need
not be known a priori, since this is observable. Indeed, the existence of the common choice
33

Berry (1994) and Berry and Pakes (2007) show existence and uniqueness of an inverse choice probability
in models with an additive structure. Gandhi (2008) relaxes the separability requirement. Our lemma
addresses only uniqueness conditional on existence. Under the maintained assumption that the model is
correctly speci…ed, any observed choice probability vector must have a vector ( 1 ; : : : ; J ) that rationalizes it.
Gandhi (2008) provides additional conditions guaranteeing that an inverse exists for every choice probability
vector in 4J . Our uniqueness result di¤ers from his only slightly, mainly in recognizing that the argument
applies to a somewhat more general model of preferences.

27

probability is directly testable. This condition still requires su¢ ciently rich J-dimensional
micro data; however, it is considerably weaker than the full support condition, which essentially required all points in 4J to be common choice probabilities.
With the connected substitutes and common choice probability assumptions, we can show
identi…cation of demand using the instrumental variables conditions of Newey and Powell
(2003).

Note that, in contrast to the results in section 5, here the entire xt vector appears as an
argument of the “regression”function

Testable Restrictions

The models we have considered incorporate several important maintained assumptions.
These include the existence of a vertical consumer-choice observable zijt , the restriction
to a scalar vertical market/choice-speci…c unobservable

jt ,

and the invariance of

jt

to zit .34

Here we show that these assumptions imply testable restrictions. We begin with the existence of the vertical consumer-choice observable zijt .
Remark 1. Suppose preferences can be characterized by (5), or by (19) with

strictly

increasing in its …rst argument. Then Pr (yit = jjt; fzikt gk2J ) is increasing in zijt :
This is immediate from the requirement that the utility from good j be strictly increasing
in zijt . Furthermore, it is clear that the restriction need not hold if utilities sometimes are
decreasing in zijt .
The assumption of a scalar vertical unobservable also leads to testable implications.

For

simplicity we show this here for binary choice. To state the result it will be useful to recall
Theorem 4 and let

t

(ztq ; q; xt ) denote the value of

t

identi…ed from the common choice

probability q in market t.
Remark 2. In the binary choice model with preferences given by (5), suppose Assumptions
4, 12, and 8 hold. Then

t

(ztq ; q; xt ) must be strictly decreasing in ztq across markets.

This follows from the fact that vit is strictly increasing in both zit and

t

under the as-

sumptions of the model. Thus, the value ztq required to attain the common choice probability
q in market t will be higher when the unobservable

t

is lower. The following example shows

one way that a model with a horizontal rather than a vertical unobservable characteristic
can lead to a violation of this restriction.
Example 2. Suppose

(xt ; t ;

the set of markets in which
34

t

it )

=

it t ,

with

it

N(0; 1). Take q > 1=2 and consider

(ztq ; q; xt ) > 0. Recall that each ztq is observable and is de…ned
(1)

(1)

Recall that zijt and zit refer to the original zijt and zit .

29

such that Pr (

it t

< ztq ) = q. Letting

denote the standard normal CDF, this requires
ztq

8t:

=q

t

Therefore, by construction,

ztq
t

(21)

will take the same value in every market. Since each ztq must

also be positive when q > 1=2, this requires a strictly positive correspondence between ztq and
t

across markets, violating the restriction from Theorem 2.
The restriction in Remark 2 follows from the requirement of a vertical

jt .

Additional

testable implications follow from the restriction to a scalar choice/market-speci…c unobservable

jt

that is invariant to zit : the values of

jt

inferred from any any two common choice

probabilities must agree.
Remark 3. In the binary choice model with preferences given by (5), suppose Assumptions
4 and 12 hold. In addition, suppose q and q 0 are two common choice probabilities.
t

(ztq ; q; xt ) =

t

Then

q0

zt ; q 0 ; xt for all t.

Proof. Under the assumptions of the model,

t

(ztq ; q; xt ) =

ztq ; q 0 ; xt =

t.

The following example demonstrates that this restriction can fail if the assumption of a
scalar market/choice-speci…c unobservable is violated.

Aggregate Data with Market Groups

In many applications one is forced to work without micro data linking choices to individual
characteristics, relying instead on market level choice probabilities (market shares). In Berry
and Haile (2009a) we explore identi…cation in such settings. However, in some environments
without individual level data the results in the present paper can still be reinterpreted to
apply.
Without micro data, the observables are f(yit ; xjt )gj2J . Partition xjt into

(i)

(ii)

xjt ; xjt

and suppose preferences can be represented by conditional indirect utilities of the form
(ii)

(i)

vijt = xjt + (xjt ;

jt ; ! it ):

Assume further that the set of markets can be partitioned into market groups

for all t 2 , xjt ;

such that

. One natural example of such an environment is that

j

of a national industry (e.g., the U.S. automobile industry) in which the physical products
themselves are identical across regions of the nation, but regions may di¤er in average income,
product prices (e.g., due to f.o.b. pricing), prices of complementary goods (e.g., gasoline),
availability of substitute goods (e.g., public transportation), etc.
For simplicity, we illustrate the argument only for the case of full identi…cation with
exogenous product characteristics. However, all the identi…cation results obtained above
have analogs in this setting.

Here we require su¢ cient variation in a special product characteristic rather than a special

31

now replaces the notion of “market”in our original framework. Within each market group,
(i)

xjt can now play the role of the “micro data.”
With this reinterpretation, the setup is isomorphic to that in section 5, and the prior

Because the setup here is isomorphic to that for the original micro data setting, extensions

Conclusion

We have studied nonparametric identi…cation of models of multinomial choice demand, allowing for market/choice-speci…c unobservables, endogenous choice characteristics, and arbitrary random heterogeneity across consumers in tastes for products and/or characteristics.
We obtained full identi…cation using the same kind of large support assumption used to
show identi…cation in even the simplest semiparametric discrete choice models, and the
same instrumental variables conditions required for identi…cation of nonparametric regres35
An interesting but unresolved question is what can be learned in a single market with a large choice
set, i.e., with J ! 1 (see Berry, Linton, and Pakes (2004)). Suppose that xjt does not include product
dummies but preferences can still be represented by (5), imposing a symmetry condition that the same
function apply to all products. Fixing a market with a …nite choice set, the market share of the outside
good is
(1)
(1)
p0 = Pr zi1 + (x1 ; 1 ; ! it ) < 0; : : : ; ziJ + (xJ ; J ; ! it ) < 0 :

For any …nite J, a large support condition would give identi…cation of the joint distribution of
( (x1 ; 1 ; ! it ) ; : : : ; (xJ ; J ; ! it )), so that each j
med
xj ; j ; ! it jxj ; j could be considered known.
As J ! 1 one would then obtain an arbitrarily good approximation of the joint distribution of ( j ; xj ). If
this joint distribution were instead known, the fact that j = D xj ; j would allow identi…cation of D from
the results of Chernozhukov and Hansen (2005). Identi…cation of demand and full identi…cation would then
follow.

32

sion models. Further, the results rely on the large support only for identi…cation of tail
probabilities, whereas identi…cation of demand holds under a signi…cantly weaker support
condition.

This is particularly encouraging given the su¢ ciency of the demand structure

for many questions motivating estimation of discrete choice demand models.
While one goal of our work has been to obtain results with few restrictions on preferences,
there are some costs to a choice not to place more structure on the form of utility functions.
One is that some types of counterfactuals will not be identi…able. An example is demand
for a hypothetical product with characteristics outside their support in the data generating
process. This kind of limitation is not special to our setting, but inherent to empirical analysis: extrapolation and interpolation typically require some parametric structure. Of course,
one may have more con…dence in extrapolations when identi…cation holds nonparametrically
within the support of the observables.
A second limitation concerns welfare. Our model (5) incorporates quasilinear preferences.
This provides a speci…cation of cardinal utility that can be used to characterize changes in
utilitarian social welfare (in aggregate, or across subpopulations de…ned by observables)36
or changes in welfare under any social welfare function that is anonymous conditional on
observables.

However, our model lacks the structure required for welfare analysis that

depends on the distribution of changes in individual utilities. Characterization of Pareto
improvements, for example, would require tracking each individual consumer’s position in
the distribution of utilities before a policy change to that after. Our model speci…es a distribution of conditional indirect utilities, not a distribution of parameters whose realizations
can be associated with individual consumers. This points out a limitation of nonparametric
random utility models as a theoretical foundation for some kinds of welfare analysis: such
welfare calculations require additional a priori structure.
36

The quasilinearity generally will not be in income, but one can describe changes in aggregate compen(1)
sating/equivalent variation in units of the normalized marginal utility for zijt . Income (and/or price) will
typically enter preferences through the function in (5). The potential nonlinearity of , combined with our
inability to track individuals’positions in the distributions of normalized utilities as the choice environment
varies, prevents characterization of aggregate compensating variation or equivalent variation in income units.
One could address this limitation with an assumption that vijt is linear in price. Further, in Berry and
(1)
Haile (2009a) we provide conditions under which quasilinearity in price can replace quasilinearity in zijt .

33

An example of a model with su¢ cient structure to address all types of welfare questions (and to extrapolate/interpolate) is the linear random coe¢ cients random utility model

This generates a special case of our model, so we have provided conditions for identi…cation
of

and the joint distribution of fvijt gj2J j xjt ;

be clear that the joint distribution of (

it ; i1t ; : : : ; iJt )

jt ; zijt j2J .

However, it should

is not identi…ed without additional

restrictions.37 Moving from our full identi…cation results to identi…cation of the distribution
of parameters in (23) is equivalent to the standard problem of identi…cation of a linear random
coe¢ cients regression model. Beran and Hall (1992) and Beran, Feuerverger, and Hall
(1996) have discussed su¢ cient conditions, which involve regularity and support requirements
beyond those required for our results.

Whether pursuing this line of argument enables

any relaxation of existing identi…cation results for linear random coe¢ cients models (e.g.,
Ichimura and Thompson (1998), Briesch, Chintagunta, and Matzkin (2005), Gautier and
Kitamura (2007)) is an open question.
Finally, while a novel aspect of our work is its examination of identi…cation without
large support conditions, even our weaker “common choice probability” condition requires
J-dimensional micro data.

One can easily imagine applications where this will not be

available. In the extreme, when no micro data are available, one is in the case of marketlevel data, and we explore that setting in Berry and Haile (2009a).

Whether the su¢ cient

conditions for identi…cation there could be relaxed in intermediate cases— where there is
some micro data, but of a lower dimension than that of the choice set— is an interesting
question for future work.

37

For any true model with the form (23), an observationally equivalent model is obtained by setting it =
= 0 and letting the joint distribution of ( i1t ; : : : ; iJt ) jfxjt ; zijt ; jt gj2J equal that of
