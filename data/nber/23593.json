    "abstract": "\n\nNeoclassical theory assumes that firms have no power of fiat any different from ordinary market contracting, thus a fortiori no power to influence the rules of the game. In the real world, firms have such power. I argue that the more firms have market power, the more they have both the ability and the need to gain political power. Thus, market concentration can easily lead to a \u201cMedici vicious circle,\u201d where money is used to get political power and political power is used to make money.\n\n",
