ABSTRACT
The model of rational inattention with Shannon mutual information costs is increasingly ubiquitous.
We introduce a new solution method that lays bare the general behavioral properties of this model
and liberates development of alternative models. We experimentally test a key behavioral property

Introduction

The model of rational inattention with Shannon mutual information costs
(henceforth the Shannon model) is increasingly ubiquitous. While the pioneering contributions of Sims [1998, 2003] considered its implications for
macroeconomic dynamics, the ensuing period has seen applications to such
diverse subjects as stochastic choice (Matejka and McKay [2011, 2013]), investment decisions (e.g van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp [2008]), global games
(Yang [2011]), and pricing decisions (Mackowiak and Wiederholt [2009], Matejka [2010] Martin [2013]). Yet despite its growing importance, little of a general
nature is known about the behaviors the Shannon model produces. Even solving the model can be challenging absent additional restrictions on the signal
space and/or the utility function (Sims [2006]).
We introduce a new approach to solving the Shannon model that lays bare
its behavioral properties and liberates development of alternative models. Our
“posterior-based” approach explicitly models the decision maker’s choice of
signals, as characterized by the resulting posterior distribution over states of
the world. The resulting necessary and su¢ cient conditions for rationality
identify behavioral patterns that characterize the Shannon model.1
We establish two de…ning behavioral properties of the Shannon model. The
…rst property relates to changes in incentives. We show that the ratio of the
di¤erence in utilities across chosen acts to the log di¤erence in posterior beliefs
is constant across states and decision problems. This “invariant likelihood
ratio”(ILR) property pins down the rate at which choice mistakes respond to
changes in the cost of these mistakes. The second property relates to changes
in prior beliefs. We show that posterior beliefs are invariant to local changes
in prior beliefs - the “locally invariant posteriors”(LIP) property.
1

In general, rational inattention problems have been approached by considering the problem of directly choosing the optimal joint distribution of state and chosen act. One exception
is Matejka and McKay [2011], who consider the choice of posteriors but do not use the net
utility approach. The net utility approach has been used in a related setting by Kamenica
and Gentzkow [2011].

We experimentally test the ILR property characterizing the elasticity of
choice mistakes with respect to attentional incentives. We …nd that subjects
are less responsive to such changes than the model implies. We introduce
generalized entropy cost functions that better match this feature of the data
while retaining key simplifying features of the Shannon model.
In addition to the two key invariants, the posterior-based approach enables
us to analyze many other properties of the Shannon model. We show that an
optimal strategy exists involving no more acts being taken than there are
states of the world, that collections of chosen acts relate uniquely to posterior
beliefs, and that an envelope condition characterizes dependence of the value of
the optimal strategy on model parameters. We identify also conditions under
which the model has a unique solution.
We adapt the design of Caplin and Dean [2013] (henceforth CD13) to
conduct our experimental test of the ILR property. Subjects are shown a
display with a number of red and blue balls, with the true state determined by
the number of red balls. They are then asked to choose between acts with state
dependent payo¤s. We observe how subjects’patterns of choice vary with the
value of choosing the correct act. We compare this experimental variation to
that predicted by the Shannon model, as embodied in the ILR condition. We
…nd that subjects are generally less responsive to changes in incentives than
the Shannon model implies. To accommodate our …ndings, we generalize the
model to a broader class of “posterior-separable”attention cost functions. We
show that this class allows a better …t to the experimental data, while retaining
key simplifying features of the Shannon model.
Section 2 introduces the posterior-based approach and uses it to solve the
Shannon model. Section 3 derives the two behavioral invariants, with other
theoretical results in section 4. Section 5 introduces our experimental design
and results. Section 6 introduces posterior-separable models. Section 7 concludes. Our approach is of particular value in dynamic settings in which beliefs
evolve due to the interaction between attentional e¤ort and exogenous shocks.
It is equally of value in strategic settings (e.g. Martin [2013]).

The Posterior-Based Approach

2.1

The Decision Problem

A decision making environment comprises possible states of the world
=
f
for f 2 F
f1; ; m; ; M g and a set F of acts with state dependent payo¤s Um
and m 2 . We de…ne = ( ) as the set of probability distributions over
states, with m indicating the probability of state m given 2 . The state of
the world is assumed to be knowable in principle, but obtaining (or processing)
information is taken to be costly.
A decision problem consists of a prior distribution over these states of
the world and the subset of acts from which the decision maker (DM) must
choose.2 We reserve the special notation 2 for prior beliefs, with
the
corresponding set of possible states of the world. To ensure that maximization
problems have a solution, we assume that the set of feasible utility vectors is
closed and bounded above.
De…nition 1 A decision problem comprises a pair ( ; A) 2
F, where
F
2F =; comprises all non-empty sets A F such that fU f 2 RM jf 2 Ag
is closed and bounded above.

2.2

Attention Strategies and Shannon Costs

Prior to choosing an act, the DM must choose an attention strategy detailing
their method of learning about the state of the world. As is standard in the
rational inattention literature, we model the DM as choosing a …xed attention
strategy for each decision problem that (stochastically) maps states of the
world to a set of signals. Since we will be characterizing an expected utility
maximizing agent, we identify these signals with the posteriors 2 which
they produce. For simplicity, we consider only attention strategies with …nitely
2

Both of which are assumed known to the DM.

4

many possible posteriors. Since we are assuming a …nite state space, this
restriction is immaterial in the current context, as we discuss in section 4.2.
An attention strategy is identi…ed with a function : ! ( ) that speci…es the probability of receiving each signal in each state of the world.3 Feasible
attention strategies are constrained to satisfy Bayes’law. Given 2 ; any
corresponding attention strategy :
! ( ) has (…nite) image ( )
and must be such that, for all m 2
and 2 ( ),
m

=

m m(
M
X

j

)

j(

,
)

j=1

where m ( )
(m)(f g) is the probability of receiving the signal that gives
posterior beliefs in objective state m.
We assume that information is costly, with costs measured in the same
expected utility units in which the prizes are measured. Furthermore, we
assume that the cost of an attentional strategy is linearly related to Shannon’s
measure of the mutual information between 2 and ,

The Shannon mutual information cost function has been heavily used in the
rational inattention literature since it was popularized by Sims [1998]. Such
use has been justi…ed both axiomatically and through links to optimal coding
in information theory (see Sims [2010] and Matejka and McKay [2013] for
discussions).

2.3

The Posterior-Based Approach and Net Utility

The Shannon model assumes that a rationally inattentive DM selects an attention strategy which maximizes expected utility from the subsequent choice
of acts net of mutual information attention costs. The most commonly used
approach to solving such models is to focus directly on the DM’s probability
of choosing each act f 2 A in each state m 2 (see for example Sims [2006],
Matejka and McKay [2013]). The attention strategy can then be mechanically
computed from the joint distribution of states and acts. In our approach this
procedure is reversed. We solve the model by focusing directly on choice of
posterior beliefs, deriving the state dependent choice probabilities from this
solution.
To develop the posterior-based method, we …rst reformulate the optimization problem as in Matejka and McKay [2011]. A feature of the Shannon cost
function is that strictly more informative strategies are strictly more attentionally expensive than less informative such strategies. Hence optimization is
inconsistent with choice of the same act at two distinct posteriors. This implies that, for purposes of optimization, an attention strategy can be speci…ed
as a subset of available acts B A chosen with strictly positive unconditional
probabilities P f > 0, and corresponding act-speci…c posteriors, f 2 . The
posteriors and probabilities must satisfy Bayes’law with respect to the prior
beliefs.
De…nition 2 Given ( ; A) 2
F, a (posterior-based) attention strategy

A standard result is that the mutual information of two random variables
X and Y can be written as the di¤erence between the Shannon entropy of X,

and the expected Shannon entropy of X conditional on Y .4 Hence the Shannon
attention cost function with parameter > 0 is de…ned on (B; P; ) 2 ( ;A)

where H( ) =

Specifying information costs this way allows us to write the DM’s optimization problem in a particularly convenient way. As the gross bene…t associated

with an attention strategy (B; P; ) is given by f 2B P f M
j=1 m Um , the objective function of the DM facing decision problem ( ; A) can be de…ned in

Each posterior belief/act pair has a net utility associated with it, which is equal
to the expected utility of using that act at that posterior minus the information
cost associated with that posterior. Since the term H( ) is independent of the
attention strategy, we can ignore it, and characterize the DM as maximizing
the weighted average of act-speci…c net utilities.
It is convenient to treat the posterior probability of state M as the residual,

net utility functions.5 Having done so, a simple geometric construction illustrates computation of net utilities. Figure 1 illustrates for a decision problem
with M = 2, A = ff; gg, U1f = U2g = ln(1 + e), U2f = U1g = 0, and = 1. The
horizontal axis represents the probability 1 2 [0; 1] of state 1.

Figure 1: Net Utility Functions

Figure 2: Optimal Posteriors

Figure 1 enables the value of all attention strategies to be visualized. For
any given prior 1 2 [0; 1], a feasible attention strategy in which both acts are
taken with positive probability corresponds to posteriors f1 ; g1 that contain
the prior interior to their convex hull. Assuming that acts are chosen optimally
given posterior beliefs this requires f1 > 1 and g1 < 1 . Given two such
posteriors, the utility of the corresponding attention strategy is the weighted
average of the net utility associated with each posterior, with the expectation
taken using the act-speci…c probabilities. Given the choice of posteriors, the
act speci…c probabilities are pinned down by condition 1. Geometrically, this
means that the value of an attention strategy consisting of posteriors f1 ; g1

Solving the Shannon Model

model.

The geometric approach to computing the payo¤ to attention strategies
suggests that rationally inattentive strategies are de…ned by the posteriors
and acts whose associated net utility functions support the highest chord above
the prior. In order to identify such posteriors, one can concavify the upper
envelope of the net utility functions by …nding the minimal concave function
that majorizes them all, a construction familiar from the work of Kamenica and
Gentzkow [2011] and others (see section 2.4.1 for further details). The optimal
attention strategy for any prior is given by the posteriors that support this
concavi…ed net utility function above that prior.
Figure 2 illustrates this concavi…cation operation for our running example
in the case where 1 = 0:5. The shaded region is the lower epigraph of the
concavi…ed version of the maximum net utility function. This epigraph is a
closed, convex set that is bounded above in the net value coordinate. This implies that a rationally inattentive strategy has associated with it a hyperplane
in RM which supports it (also illustrated in …gure 2). The net utility functions
associated with all acts lie weakly below this hyperplane, while those of chosen acts touch the hyperplane at their associated posterior beliefs. Lemmas
9

1 and 2 in the appendix demonstrate that both of these results generalize to
arbitrary decision problems.
The Shannon mutual information cost function has many features which
make the hyperplane characterization particularly powerful. First, it is differentiable. Second, it e¤ectively rules out corner solutions (as the marginal
cost of information goes to in…nity as a posterior belief approaches 0). These
two conditions enable us to provide a derivative-based characterization of the
supporting hyperplane (lemma 3 in the appendix). Finally, its functional form
provides easily tractable tangency conditions. Theorem 1 uses these features
to characterize rationally inattentive behavior in terms of suitably transformed
utility parameters,

The …rst of these properties derives from the fact that the net utility functions of the chosen acts must support the same hyperplane at their associated
posteriors. The second derives from the fact that the net utility functions of
all unchosen acts must lie weakly below this hyperplane.
10

These equations can, in many cases, be used directly to solve for the optimal attention strategy. For example, the main behavioral equation in Yang
[2011] (equation 10) corresponds to the analogous condition for continuous
state spaces. The equations also highlight a number of important general
properties of such solutions, as we discuss in sections 3 and 4.

2.4.1

Comparison to Other Approaches

The most commonly used approach to solving models of rational attention
is to directly focus on the decision maker’s state dependent stochastic choice
function (see for example Sims [2003], [2006]). This method takes as the control
variable the DM’s probability of choosing each act f 2 A in state m 2 , with
information costs based on the mutual information between the distribution
of chosen acts and prior distribution over states of the world. While this
formulation is equivalent to ours, there are insights into behavior that are
easier to identify based on choice of posterior. We discuss these insights in the
next two sections.
Another approach, taken by Matejka and McKay [2011] is to focus on
choice of posterior beliefs, but to attack the problem directly using the KarushKuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, rather than using concavi…ed net utility and
the separating hyperplane theorem. While this approach results in somewhat
similar conditions, it turns out that, because the problem is not convex, the
KKT conditions are necessary, but not su¢ cient for optimality (we provide a
demonstration of the lack of su¢ ciency in the online appendix).
The approach we take shares many technical similarities with that taken
by Kamenica and Gentkow [2011] (henceforth KG) to solve their model of
optimal persuasion. KG consider a situation in which a sender chooses a signal
structure with which to convey information about the true state of the world to
a receiver, who then chooses an action to take. In essence, the sender chooses
a set of posterior beliefs in order to maximize their expected “net utility”, just
as they do in our formulation of the rational inattention model. The di¤erence
11

is that, while in the rational inattention model the DM is constrained by the
cost of information, in the KG model they are constrained by the fact that
the receiver will choose an action at each posterior in order to maximize their
own utility rather than that of the sender. The key formal connection is that
the same concavi…cation operation is used in both cases to identify optimal
strategies. This suggests that certain of the insights and techniques we develop
may be of value in models of optimal persuasion.

Two Behavioral Invariants

Theorem 1 highlights two important behavioral regularities associated with
the Shannon model. These go far beyond the conditions that characterize the
general class of rationally inattentive models (CD13).6 They involve invariance
properties of the model solution to changes in the underlying decision problem,
in particular the incentives for attention and prior beliefs.

3.1

Invariant Likelihood Ratio and the Cost Elasticity
of Mistakes

The ILR condition of theorem 1 embodies an invariance condition with respect
to changes in the state dependent utilities associated with chosen acts. In any
decision problem, for any two acts that are chosen with positive probability
in some state, the ratio of the relative utility of those two acts in that state
to the log ratio of the posterior probability of that state when each act is
chosen is …xed, and equal to the cost of information. Thus, as the di¤erence in
utilities between two acts in some state changes, so the relative probabilities
of choosing those acts must also change in a constrained way.
6
A “No Improving Action Switch (NIAS)” condition which ensures that chosen acts are
optimal at each posterior and a “No Improving Attention Cycle (NIAC)” condition which
ensures that choice of attention strategy can be rationalized by some cost function.

12

We illustrate the power of this property by demonstrating how it pins down
the response of choice “mistakes” to changes in incentives. From the point
of view of a fully informed observer, a rationally inattentive DM may make
mistakes: they will sometimes choose an action which is suboptimal given
the true state of the world (though is optimal given their posterior beliefs).
The ILR condition speci…es how the probability of such mistakes responds
to changes in incentives. To illustrate, consider symmetric decision problems
with two states, two acts ff; gg and = (0:5; 0:5) such that,
U1f = U2g = U2f + c = U1g + c;
with c > 0. The superior choice is therefore f in state 1 and g in state 2,
while c parameterizes the cost of making the wrong choice. Direct application
of the ILR equation for chosen acts shows that the probability of choosing the
correct action in each state is related to the cost of a mistake in that state in
a simple manner,

This enables us to compute the elasticity of errors with respect to the cost of

We test this property explicitly in section 5

3.2

Locally Invariant Posteriors

We now consider how optimal attention strategies respond to changes in prior
beliefs - an issue of interest in dynamic and in strategic applications of the
Shannon model [see for example Martin [2013]]. Figure 2 suggests a powerful
invariance condition - that optimal posterior distributions are locally invariant

13

to changes in prior beliefs. As per lemma 2, we identify the optimal behavior
for prior 1 = 0:5 by identifying the posterior beliefs that support that tangent
hyperplane to the lower epigraph of the concavi…ed net utility function above
that prior. However …gure 2 makes clear these posteriors also support the
tangent hyperplane above all priors in the range [ 11 ; 21 ]. It follows that the
optimal strategy for priors in this range uses the same posterior beliefs as for
1 = 0:5.
This highlights a general result: if a set of acts B and act speci…c posteriors
form the basis for an optimal strategy for some decision problem
f 2B
( ; A), then they also form the basis for an optimal strategy for any decision
problem ( A) from which it is feasible to use these posteriors - that is for

Corollary 1 has important implications for solving rational inattention
models: the solution to one decision problem identi…es a solution to many
related problems. It also has comparative static implications for how the unconditional probability of choosing a given act must change with local changes
in the prior belief. With posterior beliefs unchanged, the unconditional probabilities of choosing each act must change mechanically in order to ensure that
Bayes’ rule is obeyed. Consider for example the two act, two state, case in
…gure 2 with prior 1 2 ( f1 ; g1 ). In this case we can use Bayes’ rule to explicitly solve for P f ( 1 ) as a function of 1; f1 ; and g1 , and establish that the
local response of P f to changes in prior belief depends only on the di¤erence

Further Implications

We highlight additional features of the Shannon model that are revealed by
the posterior-based approach which are of use for understanding the Shannon
model.

4.1

The Envelope Condition

Our approach allows us to use the envelope condition to characterize the e¤ect
of changing prior beliefs on expected utility. Given A 2 F, de…ne V A :

V A( ) =

4.2

States Bound Acts

Theorem 1 implies that an optimal attention strategy exists that uses no more
acts than there are states of the world. Intuitively, the optimal strategy for a
given decision problem can be found by identifying acts whose net utility functions touch the hyperplane that supports the concavi…ed net utility function
above the prior. With M states of the world, Charateodory’s theorem implies
that any such hyperplane is de…ned by any M points it contains. For example,
in the two dimensional case of …gure 2, the supporting hyperplane is a line, as
de…ned by any pair of its points. This in turn implies that the hyperplane can
be supported by and M act/posterior pairs, which in turn form an optimal
strategy.
Corollary 3 (States Bound Acts - SBA): Given ( ; A) 2
exists a rationally inattentive strategy with jBj M .

Unique Posteriors

Consider decision problems which share the same prior, have di¤erent available
acts, and yet for which the same acts are optimally chosen. In this case we
show in corollary 4 that the posteriors associated with all chosen acts will be
identical. In two decision problems with the same prior in which the subjects
make use of the same acts, they will have the same posteriors.
Corollary 4 (Unique Posteriors): If (B; P; ) 2 ^ (
^ ( ;C) , then (f ) = (f ) all f 2 B.

and (B; Q; ) 2

The Unique Posteriors property tells us that there can be at most one
possible set of posteriors that satis…es the ILR conditions for a given prior and
a given set of chosen acts.

16

4.4

Uniqueness

One natural question is whether the Shannon model always makes unique
behavioral predictions. The answer is no, yet we can provide conditions under
which uniqueness is guaranteed. Consider our running example with A =
ff; gg, = 1, U1f = U2g = ln(1 + e), and U2f = U1g = 0. Note that,
f

By the necessity aspect of theorem 1, both acts can be chosen only if the ILR

of theorem 1, choosing all three acts with equal probability at these posteriors
identi…es an optimal policy for prior ( 1 ; 2 ) = (0:5; 0:5), as does choosing act
h for sure.

2 .

Theorem 2 has strong implications for data derived from more than one
decision problem. By theorem 1, observation of behavior in a single decision
problem enables the cost parameter to be identi…ed, provided two or more
distinct acts are chosen. Theorem 2 implies that this uniquely pins down
observed behavior in all other decision problems provided the independence
condition is satis…ed.

Global Comparative Statics

One of the major di¢ culties in solving rational inattention models is identifying which acts will be chosen with positive probability as part of the optimal
strategy. As theorem 1 demonstrates, once this is known, it is relatively easy
to solve for the associated optimal posteriors and unconditional probabilities
associated with each act.
The posterior-based approach o¤ers help in this regard by identifying, for
any set A 2 F, all subsets of acts that can possibly be chosen together as part
of an optimal strategy for some prior beliefs. Because optimal strategies can
be characterized by a supporting hyperplane that touches the lower epigraph
of the concavi…ed net utility function at the net utility functions of the used
acts, for any collection of acts to be used together there must be a tangent
hyperplane that is supported by the net utility functions of those acts.

Figure 3 illustrates this concept in the case of two states of the world and
three acts h1 (which pays 2 in state 1 and 0 otherwise), h2 (which pays 2 in
state 2 and 0 otherwise) and h3 (which pays 1.5 in both states). This makes
it clear that there are …ve classes of solution to this problem, depending on
prior beliefs.

probabilities P f are then determined by Bayes’law.
By identifying optimal acts for all vectors , one can in this manner characterize rationally inattentive policies for all priors 2 . Identi…cation of the

case. Table 1 indicates the link between the regions of the dual cone and the
set of priors for which the supporting acts form an optimal solution.

An Experimental Test of ILR

In this section we present an experiment that allows us to observe subjects’
attentional responses to changing incentives, which we compare to the predictions of the Shannon model. To perform these tests we generate “state
dependent stochastic choice data” (see CD13). For a given decision problem
( ; A) 2
F, we estimate the probability of choosing each act in each state
of the world - i.e. a mapping q :
! (A). This identi…es not only all
chosen acts, but also how unconditionally likely each such act is to be chosen, and the corresponding revealed posteriors. Together, these constitute the
revealed posterior-based attention strategy.
20

5.1

Experimental Design

We use the method of CD13 to generate state dependent stochastic choice
data. In a typical round of the experiment, a subject is shown a screen on
which there are displayed 100 balls. Some of the balls are red with the remainder blue. The state of the world is identi…ed by the precise number of
balls that are red as opposed to blue. Prior to observing the screen, subjects
are informed of the probability distribution over such states. Having seen the
screen they choose from a number of di¤erent acts whose payo¤s are state
dependent. A decision problem is de…ned by this prior information and the
set of available acts, as in section 2.1. Each subject faces each speci…c decision
problem 50 times, allowing us to approximate their state dependent stochastic choice function. In a given session, each subject faced 4 distinct decision
problems. All occurrences of the same problem were grouped, with the order
of the problem block-randomized. At the end of the experiment, one question
was selected at random for payment, which reward was added to the show up
fee of $10.

Our experiment involves 2 treatments. In both treatments there are two
equiprobable states and two acts f (x) and g(x), with f (x) paying o¤ x in state
1 (and zero otherwise) and g(x) paying x in state 2 (and zero otherwise). The
value x varies between decision problems, as in table 2. The di¤erence between
21

the two treatments rests in the di¢ culty of the underlying perceptual task. In
one case (treatment 1), it is relatively easy to discriminate, with states 1 and
2 involving 47 and 53 red balls respectively, while in the other (treatment 2) it
is harder, with 49 and 51 red balls respectively. Overall, the experiment allows
us to estimate how mistakes (i.e. the probability of choosing the lower payo¤
act) vary with rewards. The Shannon model makes strong predictions in this
regard, summarized by the ILR condition. Rearranging the …rst condition of
theorem 1 gives,

where U (x) is the expected utility of monetary prize x. Assuming that the cost

beliefs. Further assuming that costs are higher in treatment 2 than treatment
1, this ratio should be higher in decision problems in the former than the
latter. This leads to the following hypothesis.

Results

41 subjects took part in treatment 1, while 46 took part in treatment 2. Figure
5 shows the aggregate probability of correct choice for each decision problem in
both treatments. As expected, the probability of choosing correctly is higher in
the easier experiment 1, and is increasing in the rewards for making the correct
choice in both experiments. In order to compare these expansion paths to those

be explained by the Shannon model, then this ratio should equal to the cost
parameter and be invariant within each treatment. Assuming that treatment
2 is harder than 1, we would expect estimated costs to be higher in the former
than the latter. Figure 6 plots this ratio for aggregate data, and associated
standard errors.7

Figure 6a: Treatment 1

Figure 6b: Treatment 2

The key observation is that estimated costs appear signi…cantly higher
for higher reward levels, meaning that subjects do not increase attention in
response to increasing rewards as much as the Shannon model predicts. For
treatment 1, the estimated cost in state 1 is signi…cantly di¤erent between
all reward levels.8 For treatment 2, estimated cost is signi…cantly di¤erent
between all reward levels apart from between $20 and $30.9
One possible explanation for deviations between our measured behavior
and the predictions of the Shannon model is curvature of the utility function.
In order to control for this, subjects also made choices between lotteries in
the manner of the multiple price list task of Holt and Laury [2002].10 This
allows us to estimate subject-speci…c utility functions which can be used to
8

At the 0.1% level between the $2 and $10 rewards and $10 and $20 rewards, and at the
5% level between the $20 and $30 rewards.
9
In many cases there are also signi…cant di¤erences (at the 5% level) in estimated costs
between states at the same reward amount. This is true for the $10 and $20 rewards in
treatment 1 and the $2, $10 and $20 rewards in treatment 2. This …nding violates the
predictions of the Shannon model, but is driven by the fact that subjects who are completely
inattentive tend to choose option f rather than option g, meaning they are less accurate in
state 2 than in state 1.
10
Subjects had to make 10 choices between p$6:00+(1 p)$4:80 and p$11:55+(1 p)$0:30
for p = 0:1 to p = 1. Their responses are then used to estimate a CRRA utility function

24

convert prizes from monetary amounts to utility amounts. We use these data
to estimate subject-speci…c utility functions which can be used to convert
prizes from monetary amounts to utility amounts.11
In order to control for the e¤ect of risk aversion, we use subject-speci…c
data. We focus on subjects who (a) exhibited consistency in the risk aversion
questions (i.e. obeyed stochastic dominance) (b) were never inattentive and
(c) choose the correct act given their posterior beliefs (i.e. never violate the No
Improving Action Switches condition from CD13). The …rst condition means
that we have a well de…ned estimate of the subject’s utility function, while the
latter two mean that we can obtain a precise estimate of their costs from each
decision problem. These conditions leave us with 28 subjects in treatment 1
and 22 in treatment 2. For each of these subjects, we estimate their costs using data from state 1 in each decision problem, and then test for statistically
di¤erent costs across decision problems.12 We do this both assuming linear
utility, and using our subject-speci…c estimated utility function. In the former
case, 34%, (or 17 of 50) of subjects across the two experiments exhibit signi…cantly (at the 10% level) increased cost estimates between the $2 and $30
reward case. Controlling for risk aversion this number drops to 26% (13 of 50),
with 2 subjects (4%) exhibiting a signi…cant decrease in costs. We conclude
that a signi…cant fraction of subjects are less reactive to changes in rewards
than the Shannon model would predict, even controlling for risk aversion.
11
Note that, because only 1 in 200 questions is rewarded, the true value of choosing the
correct act for any x is,
1
1
U (x) +
U (0):
200
199
Normalizing u(0) to 0, note that hypothesis ILR still holds.
12
In some cases, our subjects were perfectly accurate at some reward level. The Shannon
model predicts that subjects will never choose to be perfectly discriminatory for positive
costs. In such cases, we test the probability of observing perfect accuracy in our sample in
decision problem x given the costs estimated in decision problem y, and reject the Shannon
model if this probability is less that 10%

Separable Models of Rational Inattention

Our experimental results suggests that there may be value to considering rational inattention models that allow for di¤erent responses to incentives than
does the Shannon model. To that end, we introduce a family of attention
cost functions that maintain much of the structure of the Shannon model, but
allows for di¤erent response elasticities. These cost functions maintain the
form of equation 2, which enables us to apply many of our same posteriorbased methods. However, we allow the cost of a posterior distribution to di¤er
from the negative of its entropy. We call this the posterior-separable class of
attention cost functions.
De…nition 4 A Strictly convex function G : RM
+ ! R 2 G generates a
posterior-separable attention cost function KG : ( ;A) ! R if, for all
( ; A) 2
F,
KG (B; P; ) =

G( ) +

X

P ( )G( ):

2B

Note that the Shannon mutual information function …ts into this class with
G( ) =
H( ). Note also that requiring strict convexity ensures that strictly
more Blackwell informative signals always involve strictly higher costs. We use
the notation NGf ( f ) to denote the net utility function associated with act f
( ;A)
when the cost function is G. We let ^ G denote the corresponding rationally
inattentive strategies.
Because posterior-separable cost functions are structurally similar to Shannon mutual information costs, many of the results of the paper apply equally
to this class. Importantly, lemmas 1 and 2 hold, so that rationally inattentive
behavior can be characterized by a supporting hyperplane to the lower epigraph of the concavi…ed net utility function. For di¤erentiable cases, lemma
3 also holds, which carries with it the ability to solve the model using derivative conditions. This in turn implies that corollaries 1, 3, and 4 hold for all
26

posterior-separable cost functions, while corollary 2 holds for all such functions
which are di¤erentiable.
We illustrate how the posterior-separable family allow for di¤erent elasticities of attention with respect to incentives by introducing a parametrized class
of cost functions Gf ; g 2 G:

Note that the second derivative of these costs functions is continuous in ,
with the Shannon entropy cost function …tting smoothly into the parametric

27

Figures 7a and 7b illustrate the shape of these cost functions (normalized
to equal 0 at 1 = 0:5) and their …rst derivatives in the symmetric two state
case and with = 1. Functions with less than 1 have a …rst derivative that
does not tend to in…nity as 1 tends to zero. This means that the marginal
cost of information does not go to in…nity, so that subjects may choose to be
fully informed.
We solve the model computationally using the derivative characterization
of lemma 3. Figure 8 plots the probability of correct choice against the cost
of mistake for di¤erent values of . For = 0:5, the DM would choose to
become fully informed when the utility di¤erence hits about 1.1. For the other
cost functions, subjects never become fully informed. Note that larger values
of imply that, for any given cost of mistakes, subjects will choose to be less
informed, and will be less responsive to a change in the cost of mistakes.

Figure 8: Attentional Response to Incentives

Figures 9a and 9b show how the extra degree of freedom introduced by
the parameter can help to match our experimental data. The two bars in
…gure 9a show the posterior probability of state 1 given the choice of f and
the posterior probability of state 2 given choice of g for each decision problem
28

in treatment 1 according to our aggregate data. Figure 9b shows the same
data for treatment 2.
On both graphs, the dashed line shows the predictions of the Shannon
model, using a treatment speci…c cost parameter chosen to minimize the mean
squared di¤erence between predicted and actual posterior beliefs (note that,
f (x)
g(x)
due to symmetry, the Shannon model predicts that 1 = 2 for every x).
The best …tting cost parameters are 8:7 in treatment 1 and 22:2 in treatment
2, which leads to a mean squared di¤erence between observed and predicted
data of 0.020.
The solid line shows the predictions of the best …tting model in the class
Gf ; g , with …xed across treatments but costs allowed to vary.13 The parameters that best …t the model are = 7:01, with costs in the …rst treatment
of 0.002 and in the second treatment of 0.046. Clearly this model provides a
much better …t of the data, with a mean squared di¤erence of 0.002.

Figure 9a: Treatment 1

Figure 9b: Treatment 2

Since the Shannon model is nested within the class of Gf ; g functions,
this broader class must weakly provided a better …t of the data. However,
criteria that punish models for having additional parameters suggest rejecting
13

Thus the shape of the cost function is constrained to be the same in the two treatments,
but the level of costs varies. This is equivalent to the way we treated the Shannon model.

29

Shannon in favor of the broader parametrized class. For example the Akaike
information criterion is lower for the model that allows for variable than for
the Shannon model.14

Concluding Remarks

Rational inattention theory is of rapidly growing importance. Yet general
behavioral implications can be hard to identify even with Shannon mutual
information costs. We develop posterior-based methods that identify key behavioral properties of this model. We experimentally test a key implication of
the Shannon model regarding changes in incentives. We …nd our subjects to
be less responsive along this dimension than is implied by the Shannon model.
We introduce a class of generalized entropy cost functions that allow for a
more ‡exible such response, and identify the improved …t that results.
The posterior-based method is currently being applied in a variety of settings. It is of particular value in dynamic settings in which the beliefs evolve
as a result of the interaction between attentional e¤ort and exogenous shocks.
It is equally of value in strategic settings (e.g. Martin [2013]).
14

The AIC is de…ned by the equation,
AIC = 2k

2 ln(L);

where k is the number of parameters of the model and L its likelihood. The AIC for the
Shannon model (allowing for di¤erent costs in the two treatments) is 10028, while for the
extended model (constant but di¤erent costs in the two treatments) the AIC is 9521. The
favored model is the one with the lowest AIC. The ‡exibility that our generalized entropy
model adds is therefore of signi…cant value in …tting our experimental data.

Proof. Given the di¤erentiability of the value function V : X ! R at
all points with m > 0, we know that for such points there is a single tan38

be a normal vector de…ning this supporting hyperplane at boundary point

By the logic of lemma 2, satisfaction of the upper equation implies satisfaction

a strict form of the ILR inequality, establishing indeed that B C is necessary
for optimality.
Now suppose that there are two distinct sets of probability weights P f ; Qf

there can only be one optimizing act that must be chosen for sure.

47

@N f ( f )

conditions are su¢ cient for property SP is immediate using m = @G
m
any f 2 B and applying UB. That they are necessary for SP to be satis…ed in
cases with fm 2 (0; 1) and with G di¤erentiable derives from the fact that SP
certainly requires that, for each f 2 B, f solves,

Given that fm 2 (0; 1) and that G 2 G is di¤erentiable, solving this problem

requires m = @G . Given this, SP directly implies CT, ED, and UB as
m
illustrated in the proof of lemma 1.

10.2

Proofs of Corollaries

All corollaries apply more generally than to the Shannon model. However for
consistency with the text they are stated only for this case. The appropriate
generalization to separable cost functions is in each case clear.
Corollary 1 (Locally Invariant Posteriors - LIP): If (B; P; ) 2 ^ ( ;A)
and (C; Q; ) 2 ( ;A) with C
B satis…es f = f all f 2 C, then
(C; Q; ) 2 ^ ( ;A) .
Proof. Note by the necessity aspect of lemma 2 that if (B; P; ) 2 ^ ( ;A)
then condition SH is satis…ed. Neither the prior 2 nor the probability map
P : B ! R feature in condition SP, while deletion of acts can only weaken
the check. Hence if (C; Q; ) 2 ( ;A) with C B satis…es f = f all f 2 C,
condition SH remains valid and the su¢ ciency aspect of lemma 2 implies it is
optimal.
Corollary 2 (Envelope Condition): Given ( ; A) 2

Proof. Consider (B; P; ) 2 ^ ( ;A) such that jBj > M . By the necessity

and (B; Q; ) 2

Proof. Note …rst that if (B; P; ) 2 ^ ( ;A) and B C A, then (B; P; ) 2
^ ( ;C) . To see this, note from the necessity aspect of lemma 2 that if (B; P; ) 2
^ ( ;A) , then condition SH is satis…ed. Since B C A, (B; P; ) 2 ( ;C) and

Comparison with KKT Conditions

Following Matejka and McKay [2011], consider the constrained optimization
problem of maximizing expected prize utility less Shannon attention costs,
subject to constraints associated with rational expectations, with act-speci…c
posteriors adding to unity, and with probabilities being non-negative. Let
2 RM be the multipliers on the rational expectations constraints and :
A ! R the multipliers on posteriors. With act set A countable, the associated
Lagrangean is,

Treating this using standard KKTcondition, a necessary condition for (B; P; )
to be rationally inattentive is that there exists ^ 2 RM , ^ : A ! R, and posteriors fm 2 for f 2 A=B such that conditions KKT 1, KKT 2, and KKT 3
are satis…ed:

The reason that these KKT conditions do not characterize rationally inattentive policies is that the objective function is not concave in the choice
variables, involving as it does product terms as between beliefs and posteriors.
As a result, one can …nd non-optimal solutions. To illustrate, consider the case
in the text with two acts, f and g, with = 1, and with U1f = U2g = ln(1 + e)
and U2f = U1g = 0. Note that an attention strategy can be fully speci…ed by
P f and f;g
0. Now consider the equal prior = 0:5 and note that
1 2 [0; 1]
the following strategy is feasible and, together with the speci…ed multipliers,
satis…es all KKT necessary conditions:
(P f ;

f

= (1; 0:5; 0:5); ^ 1 = ln(1 + e) + ln 2; ^ 2 = ln 2; ^1 = ^2 = 0:

1
1+e
; 2+e
)
Yet (P f ; 11 ; 21 ) is not optimal, since net utility to the feasible triple (0:5, 2+e
is strictly higher,

N (0:5;

1+e 1

)=
2+e 2+e
