    "abstract": "\n\nA common feature of federal systems is that tax bases are joint property.  Consequently, state and federal tax setting decisions are interdependent.  Our aim here is to put forward a rudimentary theoretical analysis of this phenomenon, and to use the theory as a framework for econometrically estimating the magnitude of the responses.  We find that when the federal government increases taxes, there is a significant positive response of state taxes.  For example, a 10-cent per gallon increase in the federal tax rate on gasoline leads to a 3.2-cent increase in the state tax rate.\n\n",
