Climate Shocks and Exports

NBER Working Paper No. 15711

JEL No. F18,Q54
ABSTRACT
This paper uses international trade data to examine the effects of climate shocks on economic activity.
We examine panel models relating the annual growth rate of a country’s exports in a particular product
category to the country’s weather in that year. We find that a poor country being 1 degree Celsius
warmer in a given year reduces the growth rate of that country’s exports by between 2.0 and 5.7 percentage
points, with no detectable effects in rich countries. We find negative effects of temperature on exports
of both agricultural products and light manufacturing products, with little apparent effects on heavy
industry or raw materials. The results confirm large negative effects of temperature on poor countries’
economies and suggest that temperature affects a much wider range of economic activity than conventionally
thought.

This paper uses international trade data to examine the effects of climate shocks on
economic activity. At the aggregate level, Melissa Dell, Benjamin F. Jones, and Benjamin A.
Olken (2008) [hereafter, DJO] have demonstrated that higher temperatures in a given year reduce
the growth rate of GDP per-capita, but only in poor countries. The analysis of trade data in this
paper builds on that finding, with three principal motivations. First, international trade links the
fortunes of countries, providing potentially important conduits for geographically limited
climatic impacts to have global economic effects. Second, international trade data is the best
available source for identifying economic activity worldwide separately by narrowly-defined
sectors. Examining international trade data, one can thus say more precisely what sectors are
affected by climatic changes. Finally, the trade data, collected by the importing country,
provides a check on the potentially low-quality national accounts data provided by the home
country.
Our analysis employs datasets on national climate, exports to the United States, and
exports to the broader world. Using these data, we run panel regressions relating the annual
growth rate of a country’s exports in a particular product category to the country’s weather in
that year (i.e., its average temperature and precipitation). We control flexibly for product-year
interactions (to capture, for example, price or demand changes in a particular product) and
product-country interactions (to capture, for example, the fact that exports of certain products
grow faster in some places than others).
Using this approach, we find two main results. First, higher temperatures in poor
countries lead to large, negative impacts on the growth of their exports. Depending on the dataset
and specification, we find that a poor country being 1 degree Celsius warmer in a given year
reduces the growth of that country’s exports by between 2.0 and 5.7 percentage points. We find
-1-

no effect on rich countries. These results match the qualitative pattern of temperature effects on
GDP found in DJO (2008). The magnitudes here are larger than the estimated magnitude of
GDP effects in DJO (2008), suggesting a relatively greater sensitivity of national exports.
Second, we examine the industrial breakdown of the impacts of temperature. We find
substantial loci of negative impacts on agricultural exports and light manufacturing exports, with
little apparent effects on heavy industry or raw materials production. While the negative impact
on agricultural exports is consistent with the primary thrust of the climate-economy literature, the
negative impact on manufacturing may be more surprising. It is, however, consistent with a longstanding literature emphasizing that factory workers are less productive when it is hot (e.g.,
Ellsworth Huntington 1915), and the findings of DJO (2008), which also found a negative impact
of higher temperatures on industrial output in the national accounts data.
A further advantage of using export data is that it alleviates concerns about data quality in
poor countries. In particular, authors have recently questioned the validity of poor country GDP
data (e.g., Angus Deaton 2005, Alwyn Young 2009). Since export data (particularly exports to
the United States) is recorded by the importing country (e.g., the United States), and measured
with a high degree of accuracy at the importing ports, export data are likely to be much more
reliable than national accounts data, particularly for poor countries. The fact that we find similar
impacts in the export data as in the national accounts data in DJO (2008) suggests that the effects
we are picking up are, indeed, real effects rather than artifacts of the data.
I.

Data and Methodology

A. Data
The historical weather data are taken from the Terrestrial Air Temperature and
Precipitation: 1900-2006 Gridded Monthly Time Series, Version 1.01 (Kenji Matsuura and Cort
Willmott 2007). This data set provides worldwide (terrestrial) monthly mean temperature and
-2-

precipitation data at 0.5 x 0.5 degree resolution (approximately 56km x 56km at the equator).
We use geospatial software to aggregate the weather data to the country-year level, weighting by
the population distribution within the country. More details about the construction of the weather
data can be found in DJO (2008).
The trade data come from two sources. For the U.S. trade data, we use the NBER U.S.
Import Data (Robert C. Feenstra, John Romalis, and Peter K. Schott 2002). For the World Trade
data, we use the NBER-United Nations Trade Data (Feenstra et al. 2005). We aggregate these
data to either the 1 or 2 SITC digit level. We restrict our attention to those 1 or 2 digit productcountry time series where we observe positive exports in all years of the data from a particular
country, though the results are very similar if we do not make this balanced-panel restriction
(results available on request).
It is important to note that the variance in export growth is extremely large. Moreover,
the variance in export growth depends sharply on the country and product, with smaller export
volumes tending to be much noisier. For example, the standard deviation of growth of exports to
the world for a country-product time series ranges from a minimum of 5.85 percentage points
(product 11, “beverages”, from Canada) to a maximum of 235 percentage points (product 09,
“miscellaneous edible products”, from Guatemala). A Breusch-Pagan test rejects homoskedastic
export growth for both the US and World trade data at both 1 or 2 digit levels (p<.0001 in all
cases). The empirical analysis below therefore uses Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS)
to adjust for the dramatic heteroskedasticity across the product-country time series in the data.
B. Empirical Methodology
The estimating equation follows Dell, Jones, and Olken (2008). To estimate the
relationship between weather shocks and growth in international trade, we estimate the following
-3-

equation, regressing the change in the growth rate of exports of product p from country c on
temperature and precipitation in the exporting country:
log

(1)

log

In this specification, the product-country fixed effects,
growth rate of exports of product

, capture fixed differences in the

from country . The product-year fixed effects,

time specific worldwide shocks in trade of product

, capture

(for example, they capture changes in

prices; they also capture common world time effects such as worldwide recessions). The dummy
variable

captures whether the country is in the bottom or top half of the world per-capita

PPP income distribution in the first year GDP data is available, as in DJO (2008). The coefficient
provides the impact of a 1 degree Celsius temperature increase in year
from wealthy countries, while

on average exports

is the impact of a 1 degree Celsius temperature increase in

year on average exports from poor countries.
Given the substantial heteroskedasticity in export growth rates between products and
countries (see discussion above), we estimate equation (1) by FGLS, weighting each productcountry time series by the inverse variance of its residuals (see William H. Greene, 2003). Given
the large range of variances among series, correcting for heteroskedasticity is important, and
analysis without any such corrections produces noisier and less conclusive estimates.1 Standard
errors are clustered by country to allow for arbitrary serial correlation within countries and to
allow for arbitrary correlation across different exports from the same country. To learn more
about which products are more and less sensitive to temperature, we also estimate equation (1)
1

Specifically, if we re-estimate Table 1 without weights, the results at the 2-digit level are qualitatively similar to
the weighted results, but are statistically significant only for the world data. The unweighted results at the 1-digit
level are inconclusive (negative and insignificant in the world data and positive and insignificant in the U.S. data).

Results

A. Overall results
The results from estimating equation (1) are shown in Table 1. Column (1) shows results
using 1-digit SITC data on exports to the United States (i.e., an observation is the export growth
from country to the United States between time and

1 for a single 1-digit SITC category).

Column (2) presents the same results but using data at the more disaggregated 2-digit SITC level.
Columns (3) and (4) repeat the same specifications, but consider exports from country to all
countries in the world trade data (i.e., to the substantial but ultimately limited set of countries
that report in the Feenstra et al. 2005 data), rather than just exports to the United States.
-5-

The results show large, negative effects of higher temperatures on exports from poor
countries, and no effects on exports from rich countries. Focusing on the bottom row of the table,
which reports the total impact of temperature on poor country exports (

), we see that a 1

degree Celsius temperature increase reduces the export growth rate from poor countries to the
U.S. by between 3.8 percentage points (1 digit SITC data) and 5.7 percentage points (2 digit
SITC data). These effects are statistically significant at the 1 percent level. Looking at all exports
to the world, we also find very large effects – 1 degree Celsius reduces the export growth rate by
between 2.0 percentage points (1 digit, statistically significant at 5 percent) and 2.4 percentage
points (2 digit, statistically significant at 1 percent). The first row of the table shows that we find
no impact of temperature shocks on exports from rich countries. We also find little impact of
average precipitation on exports – the only exception is column (4), which suggests that greater
average precipitation in poor countries leads to more exports in the world data, though this
impact is smaller than the impact of temperature and is not robust to specification.
The patterns we see here – very large impacts of temperature on poor countries and no
impact on rich countries – mirror precisely the effects seen in Dell, Jones and Olken (2008). This
is particularly remarkable given that the data in this paper – exports – is measured predominantly
by the importing country (i.e., reported by the United States in the case of the exports to the U.S.
data, and primarily by OECD countries for exports to the World), whereas the GDP data
examined in DJO (2008) came from the poor country itself. Given recent criticisms of national
accounts data (e.g., Deaton 2005), the fact that these impacts are showing up in export data
measured by the importing country suggests that these are very much real impacts, and are not
just an artifact of the way GDP data is put together.
It is interesting to note that the magnitudes estimated here are 2-3 times larger than the
-6-

estimated impacts of temperature on the growth rate of GDP in DJO (2008), which were on the
order of 1-2 percentage points per degree Celsius. This extra sensitivity is consistent with trade
models in which domestic consumption is relatively steady, so that volatility in domestic
production translates into greater volatility in net exports.2
B. Heterogeneity by Product
Table 2 reports the results of estimating equation (1) separately for each 2-digit SITC
category of exports to the United States. Each coefficient is the total effect on poor countries (i.e
from equation (1)), and the listed p-values are from the test of no effect in poor
countries, i.e. the test that

0. To conserve space, we report coefficients only for

products where the effect of temperature is statistically significant at the 5 percent level. Panel A
shows SITC codes where the estimated temperate effect is negative and statistically significant;
Panel B shows those SITC codes where the effect is positive and statistically significant.
The first finding that emerges from Table 2 is that there are many more SITC products
that are negative and statistically significant than positive and statistically significant. Were there
no true relationship, then by random chance one would expect 2.5% of the categories (1.65 out
of 66) to be negative and statistically significant at the 5% level and a similar amount to be
positive and statistically significant. In fact, we find negative and statistically significant impacts
of temperature on exports for 20 out of the 66 categories, consistent with the very large negative
effects shown in Table 1. By contrast, we find positive and statistically significant effects for
only 2 of the 66 categories, or exactly what one would expect from random chance.

2

For example, consider a model with homothetic preferences (such as Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek) where a country’s
domestic consumption of each good scales linearly with its income. Then shocks to the domestic production of a
subset of goods will cause domestic consumption of each good to change only to the extent that aggregate national
income changes. The net exports of any particular good will thus see greater volatility than domestic output.

Notes: Regressions are Feasible Generalized Least Squares, run product by product. Each
specification includes country and year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by exporting
country.

Examining the negative and statistically significant categories, we find that the negative
impacts of temperature seem to fall into two broad categories: agricultural products (e.g., cereals,
dairy products and eggs, leather, feed stuff for animals) and light manufacturing (e.g., photo
equipment, footwear, misc manufactured goods, electrical machinery, rubber manufactures,
office machines, firearms, travel goods, plumbing, wood manufactures, metal manufactures).
Heavy industry (e.g., chemicals, paper, cement, iron and steel, cars and trucks) and raw materials
-8-

(mining, petroleum, wood and pulp) seem generally unaffected. The explanation for agriculture
seems clear (plants and animals may not thrive as well when it is too hot), and is consistent with
negative effects on agriculture in poor countries reported elsewhere (e.g., DJO 2008, Raymond
Guiteras 2009). The negative impacts on manufacturing are perhaps more surprising, and suggest
that factory workers may be less productive when conditions inside the factory become too hot.
This is consistent with the large literature on worker productivity and temperature dating back to
Huntington (1915). It is worth noting, however, that DJO (2008) also find negative impacts on
temperature on industrial GDP growth in poor countries when examining national accounts data,
so the findings in this paper confirm the findings there.
III.

Conclusions
This paper has examined the impacts of temperature shocks on exports. We find

substantial impacts of higher temperatures on poor countries exports, with no effects on richer
countries’ exports. Specifically, we find that an additional 1 degree Celsius reduces the growth
rate of a poor country’s exports by between 2.0 and 5.6 percentage points. We find that the
impacts are concentrated in exports of agricultural products and light manufactures.
The findings of this paper have several implications. First, the findings here are
remarkably similar (though greater in magnitude) to the findings that higher temperatures
negatively impact growth of GDP in poor countries, but not in rich countries, reported in Dell
Jones and Olken (2008). The fact that similar results are found in independent data lends
credibility to these estimates. Second, the impact on exports suggests that – even though we
estimate no direct impacts of higher temperatures on rich countries – rich countries may
nonetheless be affected since their imports will decline. Climate change may therefore decrease
welfare in rich countries not by affecting production directly, but by raising prices and reducing
-9-

quantities of goods imported from poorer countries. Analyzing the welfare consequences for rich
countries is one trajectory for further work.
