    "abstract": "\n\nStaggered difference-in-differences designs are pervasive in policy evaluations but little is known about the mechanisms of policy diffusion: How and why do such policies spread across jurisdictions? In this study, we highlight the role of elections in policy diffusion in settings where municipal elections are asynchronous due to historical reasons. First, we empirically show the presence of policy diffusion using neighbors\u2019 election cycles as instruments for neighbors\u2019 policy adoption. Second, we further demonstrate interactions of municipalities\u2019 election cycles with neighbors\u2019 adoption and show that they follow neighbors\u2019 policy only during their own election timing, indicating that policy diffuses through elections.\n\n",
