How Modern Dictators Survive: An Informational Theory of the New Authoritarianism
Sergei Guriev and Daniel Treisman
NBER Working Paper No. 21136
April 2015
JEL No. H5,P16
ABSTRACT
We develop an informational theory of dictatorship. Dictators survive not because of their use of force
or ideology but because they convince the public—rightly or wrongly—that they are competent. Citizens
do not observe the dictator's type but infer it from signals inherent in their living standards, state propaganda,
and messages sent by an informed elite via independent media. If citizens conclude that the dictator
is incompetent, they overthrow him in a revolution. The dictator can invest in making convincing state
propaganda, censoring independent media, co-opting the elite, or equipping police to repress attempted
uprisings—but he must finance such spending at the expense of the public's living standards. We show
that incompetent dictators can survive as long as economic shocks are not too large. Moreover, their
reputations for competence may grow over time—even if living standards fall. Censorship and co-optation
of the elite are substitutes, but both are complements of propaganda. Due to coordination failure among
members of the elite, multiple equilibria emerge. In some equilibria the ruler uses propaganda and
co-opts the elite; in others, propaganda is combined with censorship. In the equilibrium with censorship,
difficult economic times prompt higher relative spending on censorship and propaganda. The results
illuminate tradeoffs faced by various recent dictatorships.

Introduction

How do dictators hold onto power? The totalitarian tyrannies of Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, and others
relied largely—although not exclusively—on mass terror and indoctrination. Although less ideological, many
20th Century military regimes—from Franco’s Spain to Pinochet’s Chile—used considerable violence to
intimidate opponents of the regime.1 Personalistic dictators in Africa and the Caribbean—such as Mobutu,
Bokassa, Somoza, and the Duvaliers—also relied on blood and fear to sustain their rule. However, in
recent decades, a less carnivorous form of authoritarian government has emerged, one better adapted to the
globalized media and sophisticated technologies of the 21st Century. From the Peru of Alberto Fujimori to
the Hungary of Viktor Orban, illiberal regimes have managed to consolidate power without isolating their
countries from the world economy or resorting to mass killings.
Instead of inaugurating “new orders,” such regimes simulate democracy, holding elections that they make
sure to win, bribing and censoring the private press rather than abolishing it, and replacing ideology with an
amorphous anti-Western resentment.2 Their leaders often enjoy genuine popularity—albeit after eliminating
plausible rivals—that is based on “performance legitimacy,” a perceived competence at securing prosperity
and defending the nation against external threats. State propaganda aims not to re-engineer human souls but
to boost the leader’s ratings, which, so long as they remain high, are widely publicized. Political opponents
are harassed and humiliated, accused of fabricated crimes, and encouraged to emigrate.
The new-style dictators can brutally crush separatist rebellions and deploy paramilitaries against unarmed
protesters. But, compared to previous regimes, they use violence sparingly. They prefer the ankle bracelet to
the Gulag. Maintaining power, for them, is less a matter of terrorizing victims than of manipulating beliefs
about the world. Of course, totalitarian leaders also sought to influence public beliefs—some were great
innovators in the use of propaganda. Yet, how they used it was quite different. Dictators such as Hitler and
Stalin sought to fundamentally reshape citizens’ world views by imposing comprehensive ideologies. The
new autocrats are more surgical: they aim only to convince citizens of their competence to govern. The
totalitarian dictators often employed propaganda to encourage personal sacrifices for the “common good.”
Their successors seek to manipulate citizens into supporting the regime for selfish reasons. Finally, although
propaganda was important for the old-style autocracies, violence clearly came first. “Words are fine things,
but muskets are even better,” Mussolini quipped (Odegard 1935, p.261). Recent tyrannies reverse the order.
“We live on information,” Fujimori’s security chief Vladimiro Montesinos confessed in one interview. “The
addiction to information is like an addiction to drugs.” Montesinos paid million dollar bribes to television
stations to skew their coverage. But killing members of the elite struck him as foolish: “Remember why
1 More than 30,000 people are believed to have been killed by Pinochet’s agents, “most of them taken away to secret detention
centers and camps, tortured, tossed still alive from airplanes into the sea or shot and buried in unmarked graves” (Roht-Arriaza
2005, p.viii).
2 On the use of elections and partially democratic or pseudo-democratic institutions in dictatorships, see Gandhi (2008),
Gandhi and Lust-Okar (2009) and Levitsky and Way (2010). Although our focus is on “dictatorships,” which we see as synonymous with “authoritarian regimes,” we consider the dividing line between soft authoritarian regimes and illiberal democracies
to be a fuzzy one. Our model also applies to most illiberal democracies.

Notes: “Non-democracies” are countries with Polity2 scores of less than 6. A “mass killing”
is “any event in which the actions of state agents result in the intentional death of at least
1,000 noncombatants from a discrete group in a period of sustained violence.”
Pinochet had his problems. We will not be so clumsy”(McMillan and Zoido 2004, p.74). When dictators are
accused of political murders these days, it often augurs the fall of the dictatorship.
Some bloody military regimes and totalitarian states remain—for instance, in Egypt and Burma, or
North Korea—but the balance has shifted. As Table 1 shows, compared to 35 years ago, far more of
the undemocratic orders existing today have elected legislatures in which non-government parties occupy
a significant place. And fewer are currently involved in mass atrocities against their populations. Besides
Fujimori’s Peru and Orban’s Hungary, other regimes that share some or all of these characteristics include
Vladimir Putin’s Russia, Mahathir Mohamad’s Malaysia, Hugo Chavez’s Venezuela, and Recep Tayyip
Erdogan’s Turkey. One might even see Lee Kuan Yew’s Singapore as a pioneer of such “soft autocracy.”
China’s recent party bosses also fit in some respects, but whereas the other leaders just listed inherited
flawed democracies and undermined their institutions further, the institutions hollowed out in China were
those of totalitarian communism.
We develop a model of dictatorship to capture the logic that governs the survival of such regimes. As
in signaling models of democratic politics, the ruler may be either competent or incompetent.3 Only the
dictator and a subset of the public—“the informed elite”—observe his type directly. But ordinary citizens
update their beliefs about this based on the information available to them from the state media, independent
media, and their own living standards. Citizens’ private consumption depends on the tax rate set by the
dictator and on economic performance, itself a function of the leader’s competence and a stochastic shock.
If enough citizens infer, based on these various signals, that the incumbent is incompetent, they rise up
and overthrow him in a revolution. Members of the elite—if not co-opted—would also prefer to replace an
incompetent incumbent but cannot do so without the masses to back them up.4
3 Competence here refers to the ability to promote—or at least not undermine—economic growth and defend the country
against external threats. The contrast between the rapid, sustained growth in the Singapore of Lee Kuan Yew and the consistent
economic decline in the Zaire of Sese Seko Mobutu suggests that some dictators may indeed be more competent than others.
4 Leaders of authoritarian states are more often removed by coups than by mass uprisings (Geddes 1999), but we focus here
on regime change, which is less frequent than leader turnover.

The dictator can affect all the channels of information. He can spend on making the propaganda broadcast
via state media more convincing. He can bribe (or impose costs—such as fines or violence—on) the informed
elite to prevent the latter from sending critical messages. And he can censor those messages that they do send.
The dictator can also spend on hiring and equipping the police with the tools of repression, thus increasing
the cost of revolution. However, all these actions must be paid for by the government, either by raising the
tax rate (which reduces after-tax income and therefore consumption for citizens) or by reducing government
spending on other items, which may include public services that the population values. Policemen assigned
to intimidate journalists are not solving real crimes. Observing their lower consumption or the depleted
supply of public services, citizens will downgrade their estimates of the incumbent’s competence. Hence the
tradeoff.
We show how the dictator’s strategy and his equilibrium survival odds, as well as the path of citizens’
beliefs, change with the various exogenous parameters—the size of the stochastic

cc

shocks, the distribution of

competence, and the technology of censorship, propaganda, and repression. We identify two stable equilibria:
in one the dictator co-opts the elite, in the other he censors the private media. Multiple equilibria exist
because members of the elite must coordinate on a strategy. When both equilibria exist, the one with cooptation always yields the dictator higher survival odds than the one with censorship. We also find that,
so long as force is not too cost-effective, it is used against the general public only as a last resort after
co-optation, censorship, and propaganda have failed.
“Propaganda” here should be understood broadly: it refers to any action by the government that makes
the message “the leader is competent” more convincing to the public. Thus, it includes traditional instruments such as government advertising, production and broadcast of distorted news shows, pro-regime online
media, bribing and planting of stories in the supposedly independent press, and hiring of internet “trolls” to
post pro-regime comments. In China, an estimated 20 percent of all internet comments come from members
of the “50 cent party,” so-called because of the fee each is paid per pro-government post (Simon 2015, p.99).
In addition, reforming school curricula to make them more “patriotic” may fit. But propaganda can also be
understood to include actions of the government that render credible the leader’s excuses for poor economic
performance. These could include manufacturing diplomatic, economic, and even military confrontations
with foreign powers so that they can be more convincingly blamed for domestic stagnation. Of course, such
actions can be very costly for the country but still rational for the dictator if the propaganda benefit is large.
Censorship, in the new dictatorships, also involves a mix of traditional and non-traditional methods.
Besides blocking publication of specific articles or programs, it can include filtering the internet, hiring
hackers to attack opposition websites, bribing the owners and journalists in “independent” media to censor
themselves, and prosecuting and imprisoning journalists who refuse. It can also involve paying friendly
investors to buy out and domesticate critical broadcasters, overtly or through shell companies. Such activities
divert resources from productive uses and cut into government spending on welfare-enhancing programs.
China reportedly employs two million censors to police the internet (Bennett and Naim 2015). Under
Fujimori in Peru, the regime paid more than $36 million a year to the main television channels to skew their

4

coverage, and reportedly offered one channel a $19 million bribe (McMillan and Zoido 2004, pp.82-5).
The model offers insight into a number of observations and puzzles about the functioning of dictatorships.
First, it shows how modern autocracies can survive while employing relatively little violence against the
public. Repression is not necessary if mass beliefs can be manipulated sufficiently by means of censorship,
co-optation, and propaganda. Indeed, since in our model major repression is only used if equilibria based
on co-optation and censorship have disappeared, violence signals to the general public that the regime is
incompetent and therefore vulnerable. For instance, the appearance in 2000 of a tape that seemed to implicate
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma in the killing of a journalist set off protests that led ultimately to the
country’s “Orange Revolution” four years later. Conversely, when co-optation and censorship have failed
and opposition to the regime becomes overt, state repression is all that remains–and is sure to be used.
As Davenport (2007, pp.7-8) notes, one result that emerges with “astonishing consistency” from studies of
repression is that: “When challenges to the status quo take place, authorities generally employ some form
of repressive action to counter or eliminate the behavioral threat.”
Second, the effectiveness of propaganda in authoritarian regimes is a prima facie puzzle. Given that
citizens know the dictator has an incentive to lie about his type, why do they ever listen? In our model,
propaganda works because whereas competent leaders can costlessly show themselves to be competent,
incompetent ones must invest resources to fake the evidence that will make this claim convincing—and
sometimes they choose to spend their budget on other actions instead. Thus, observing a dictator claim
persuasively to be competent increases the odds that he actually is—especially given the resources he could
shift from propaganda to consumption and public goods which are directly observed by the public.
Third, why do some clearly incompetent dictators nevertheless retain power for long periods? The model
shows how rulers whom most or all citizens—if fully informed—would prefer to overthrow can still survive
in many circumstances simply by manipulating information. And we focus on a mechanism other than the
well-studied one of blocking communication among potential protesters. The dictator’s survival depends
here not on preventing citizens from expressing their willingness to rebel (in our model, we abstract from
the issue of coordination among the protesters), but on manipulating public beliefs about the state of the
world and the incumbent’s type.
Moreover, we show that over time incompetent leaders, if they survive, may acquire a reputation for
competence as a result of rational Bayesian updating by citizens. Such reputations can withstand temporary
economic downturns if these are not too large. This is consistent with the empirical finding that dictators
that last through their first few years are less likely to be overthrown (Svolik 2009, Bueno de Mesquita
and Smith 2010, Treisman 2014). However, the mechanism we propose here—of rational updating of beliefs
about the leader’s type—differs from those of Svolik (2009), who emphasizes power consolidation by the
incumbent, and Treisman (2014), who emphasizes selection effects.
Fourth, the multiple equilibria associated with different leader strategies illuminate why, among dictatorships that seem otherwise quite similar, some focus on censoring independent media while others censor much
less but co-opt the elite with patronage. For example, while Iran has the world’s strictest limits on internet

5

content, according to Freedom House, Morocco has among the least restrictive internet controls, on a par
with those of Japan (Freedom House 2013). The Moroccan royal family has consistently viewed co-optation
“as a much more effective tool than confrontation and repression,” given the country’s traditional system in
which “patronage and accommodation were deeply ingrained” (Willis 2014, p.444).
Fifth, the model predicts that as economic conditions worsen, a dictatorship may switch to using censorship in place of co-optation of the elite, and boost relative spending on censorship and propaganda. This
is consistent with a noted increase since the global financial crisis in efforts to limit opposition media in a
range of countries, from Hungary and Turkey to Russia. As Turkey’s growth rate fell from 7.8 percent in
2010 to 0.8 percent in 2012, according to the World Bank, the number of journalists in jail increased from 4
to 49.5 Between 2008 and 2011, Hungary fell 15 percentage points on Freedom House’s press freedom index.
Conversely, the result makes sense of the increasing focus on co-optation in China during its long period
of rapid growth. Starting in the 1980s, Beijing replaced the Mao-era system of comprehensive control with
one that relied increasingly on commercialized self-censorship; media owners, editors, and journalists are
rewarded for loyalty with state advertising contracts and well-paid jobs, thus incentivizing them to censor
themselves. “The desire to win performance bonuses tends to result in journalism that steers well clear of
dangerous political controversy and meets the party’s propaganda requirements,” according to one analyst
(Esarey 2005, pp.57-9). Censorship of the internet, meanwhile, has focused on blocking collective action
rather than on suppressing criticism of the government and party (King, Pan, and Roberts 2013). In Singapore as well, “forsaken profits and stiff legal penalties have been more effective in fostering self-censorship
than earlier methods of intimidation” (Rodan 1998, p.69).
Sixth, the model offers a variety of reasons why—as widely noted—modernization makes dictatorship
harder to sustain, at least in the absence of vast resource rents. By increasing the size of the “informed
elite,” economic development increases the cost for incompetent dictators of either co-opting potential critics
or censoring their media messages. Even relatively small economic shocks then become sufficient to threaten
the incumbent’s rule. If modernization also increases the technological sophistication of opposition media,
then censorship may fail for this reason as well.6
Yet, if modernization makes it harder to sustain an information-based dictatorship, we believe it increases
the costs of mass repression even more. An autocrat’s greatest nightmare is that his security services,
when ordered to violently suppress opposition, will split or simply disobey, igniting a power struggle that
undermines the regime (Francisco 2005, p.66). The more educated, globally integrated, and professionalized
are the dictator’s agents, the greater is the chance they will shrink from committing a massacre. At the same
time, harsh repression is both more public and more economically harmful in a more developed society. A
knowledge economy, dependent on innovation, stands to lose its entrepreneurs to emigration if the dictator
uses force. In a world of global media and capital flows, political violence can depress foreign investment,
stimulate capital flight, and even puncture confidence in the currency (Blanton and Blanton, 2007, Fielding
5 Data

from the Committee to Protect Journalists, https://www.cpj.org/imprisoned/2014.php.
complementary reason why modernization may encourage transition to democracy is that education increases the
taste for political participation (Glaeser, Ponzetto, and Shleifer 2007).
6 Another

6

and Shortland, 2005). All these factors help explain the modern dictator’s preference for less overt methods.
We develop the model assuming the simplest, linear technologies for propaganda, censorship, co-optation,
and repression. This allows us to study the interactions between the dictator’s techniques that arise due
to the inference problem of citizens rather than due to assuming non-linear functional forms. We point
out that propaganda (positive reports by the leader about his competence) is complementary to both the
co-optation of the informed elite and the censorship of independent media, both of which are techniques
that aim to prevent news of the incumbent’s incompetence from getting out. Censorship and co-optation
are substitutes. Repression against potential revolutionaries is a substitute for all the information-based
techniques for maintaining power. Under some parameter values, equilibria exist in which no repression
against the public is needed at all. Under other parameter values for which there are no equilibria based on
co-optation, censorship, or propaganda, an equilibrium based on repression of potential protests may exist.
To focus on the less studied aspects of the problem, we assume the uninformed public is homogeneous and
we do not examine the problem of coordination among protesters. For treatments of the latter issue, see
Edmond (2014) and Lohmann (1994).
The next section reviews related literature. Section 3 outlines the elements of the model. Section 4
derives the equilibria. Sections 5 and 6 discuss comparative statics and several extensions, including a
dynamic version of the game and one with continuous economic shocks. Section 7 concludes.

Literature

Wintrobe (1990) pioneered the formal analysis of dictators’ behavior, modeling, in a reduced form, decisiontheoretic framework, the tradeoff between investing in repression and co-opting citizens with material benefits. He examined the choices of two types of dictators—“totalitarians,” who maximized power, and “tinpot” dictators, who maximized their own consumption subject to a minimum power constraint. In Wintrobe
(2007), he generalized the dictator’s objective function to include both power and consumption, allowing the
equilibrium levels to be determined by cost parameters.
Subsequent formal analyses of dictatorship focused on several different— although related—questions.
One set of works considered the economic policies autocrats would choose and how these compare to those
prevailing under either anarchy or democracy. Olson (1993) argued that dictators’ incentives to adopt
growth-promoting policies depend on their time horizon and how encompassing an interest they have in
national output.
A second direction of research examined the role of institutions in authoritarian states, interpreting
them as mechanisms by which the ruler solved time inconsistency problems. By creating institutions that
constrained him in the short run, a dictator could commit credibly to certain policies—repaying state debts
and respecting property rights (North and Weingast 1989, Gehlbach and Keefer 2011), redistributing income
to the poor (Boix 2003, Acemoglu and Robinson 2006), or sharing power with members of his ruling group
(Myerson 2008, Svolik 2012, Boix and Svolik 2013). Models showed how such credible commitments could

7

increase borrowing power and private investment in the first case, prevent revolutions in the second, and
avoid coups or elite defection in the third.
Another literature models the relationship between dictators and their support group when such interactions are not mediated by institutions. These works examine how the dictator chooses the number and
characteristics of his inner circle (Egorov and Sonin 2011, Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003).
A fourth set of works analyzes the effects of information problems under dictatorship. By monopolizing
the media and criminalizing dissent, rulers are assumed to prevent citizens from sharing information. Some
papers in this set have explored how costly protest actions by individuals communicate facts to other individuals, triggering—or failing to trigger—informational cascades (Kuran 1991, Lohmann 1994). The greater is
the repression, the less likely are protests to occur, but the greater is the discontent that they communicate
if they do (Kricheli et al. 2011). Dagaev et al (2013) examine how new information technologies facilitate
coordination by potential opponents of a regime.
A few papers explore more complicated ways, in which dictators may seek to manipulate the information
environment. Egorov, Guriev, and Sonin (2009) and Lorentzen (2014) model the tradeoff for a dictator in
setting the level of censorship, where a free media, on the one hand, provides the information necessary for
the dictator to discipline his bureaucrats, but, on the other hand, assists the expression and coordination
of opposition. Edmond (2013) examines the strategic use of propaganda. In his game, citizens want to
overthrow an existing regime but are imperfectly informed about the regime’s “strength.” The ruler sends
costly, biased signals about the regime’s strength in the attempt to prevent citizens from coordinating
against him. Citizens, although understanding the ruler’s incentive to deceive, cannot fully separate the
true information from the bias. In this sense, propaganda can work in equilibrium, and it is more effective,
the more precise are the signals. Huang (2014) also models state propaganda as the sending of signals of
repressive capacity.7 In his model, the content of the message is irrelevant; what constitutes the signal is the
amount of propaganda sent, which citizens are assumed to observe. His key assumption is that the capacity
to broadcast propaganda and the capacity to repress rebellions are correlated, so more propaganda signals
greater repressive capacity.
Our model explores the tradeoffs for rulers who choose a portfolio of techniques—censorship, propaganda,
co-optation, and repression—to preserve their power.8 Our approach differs from those of Edmond and Huang
in that our incumbents vary in “competence,” whereas their incumbents vary in “strength,” understood as
the ability to repress mass protests. (In our model, as in Edmond’s, the “incompetent”/“weak” leaders try
to pool with the “competent”/“strong” ones and are able to do so in some states of the world.) Neither
paper considers censorship of private messages or the tradeoffs between propaganda, censorship, and positive
7 Propaganda may also feature as part of loyalty rituals in authoritarian states—the leader’s ability to get citizens to repeat
the propaganda shows the extent of his political control, deterring challenges, as discussed in many analyses of totalitarian
regimes. We abstract from such loyalty rituals here in order to focus on the type of state propaganda that aims to influence
citizens’ beliefs about the competence of the ruler (at providing economic or security benefits).
8 A considerable literature examines state repression by itself (see Davenport, 2007). However, since Wintrobe’s (1990)
decision-theoretic analysis, few papers have explored the tradeoffs between repression and other techniques in the dictator’s
repertoire. One recent exception is Frantz and Kendall-Taylor (2014), who argue that co-opting potential opponents by means
of partially-free parties and legislatures brings such opponents into the open and makes it easier to target violent repression.

and negative rewards. They focus on the way flows of information among the mass public influence protest.
We bracket this question in order to explore the game between the dictator and the “informed elite” over
propaganda, private media messages, and censorship.

Setting

3.1

Players

There is a dictator and a continuum of citizens of unit mass. The citizens are exogenously divided into
informed (elite) and uninformed (general public). The mass of informed citizens, I, is small (so the elite
cannot overthrow the dictator by themselves; the general public can). Citizens maximize their current
consumption plus the net present value of future consumption.
The dictator receives an exogenous rent each period he remains in power. He maximizes the net present
value of expected future rents. In a one-period version of the model, the dictator simply maximizes the
probability of staying in power π.
All agents are risk-neutral but also have limited liability (i.e. cannot pay large fines).

3.2

Timing

1. Nature picks I citizens who become the members of the elite. The dictator and the elite observe the
type of the dictator, θ ∈ {0, 1}. The economic shock Y is realized (Y = Y H with probability ξθ and
Y = Y L with probability 1 − ξθ ). Both the elite and the dictator observe Y .
2. The dictator chooses the level of censorship, x ∈ [0, 1]. The dictator offers a level of rewards, r ≥ 0,
to members of the elite who commit not to send anti-regime messages. The dictator chooses a level of
investment in propaganda, P .
3. The informed citizens choose whether (i) to support the regime and receive the reward, r, or (ii) to
join the opposition and to send a signal to the public. The share of those who support the regime is
α; the share of those who join the opposition is β = 1 − α.
4. Contracts for the elite are implemented. Censorship blocks x per cent of the independent signals, so
the public receives the opposition’s signals with probability (1 − x)β. Payoffs are realized.
5. Citizens observe their consumption, C, propaganda signal, p = {0, 1}, and any independent signals
that get through censorship, z = {0, 1}. The citizens update their beliefs about θ and decide whether
to overthrow the dictator.

3.3

The economy

Total output (GDP), Y , may take two values: Y L and Y H , where ∆Y ≡ Y H − Y L > 0. The probability ξθ
of the high state, Y = Y H , depends on the quality of the dictator, θ.
For simplicity, we assume that θ can take two values: θ = 0 (the dictator is incompetent) and θ = 1 (the
dictator is competent). The dictator is competent with probability θ̄ (the parameter θ̄ is therefore also the
expected value of θ).
The probability ξθ of the high output Y = Y H is higher if the dictator is competent:
ξ1 > ξ0 .
The dictator can use part of GDP for funding propaganda, P , censorship, X, and for rewarding the elites,
R. His budget constraint is Y = C + P + X + R, where C is consumed by the population. For simplicity,
we assume that C is distributed equally among citizens—so C is also per capita consumption, since the
number of citizens is normalized to 1—and is observed by all. By contrast, we assume that Y , X, P , and
R are not observed by the general public. Y may include both official and unofficial income sources, while
C may include consumption by citizens of both private goods and non-excludable public goods provided by
the government.
By spending P on propaganda, the dictator increases the probability that the public gets a convincing
propaganda message: p = 1. (The content of the message is: “the leader is competent, θ = 1”; the value
of p indicates whether it is convincing or not.) We assume that the competent dictator can send the signal
p = 1 costlessly. If the dictator is incompetent, the probability of public getting the positive message p = 1

endogenously determined in equilibrium.

3.4

Information

There are four kinds of signals in the model. First, each informed citizen learns the type of the dictator,
θ, and GDP, Y , precisely. Second, all citizens observe per capita consumption, C. Third, the dictator
disseminates propaganda—which is a public signal, p = {0, 1}, received by every citizen. Given that the
competent dictator can send p = 1 at no cost, he always does so. Therefore if the public observes p = 0, it
knows with certainty that the dictator is incompetent.
Finally, the informed citizens can send a signal z = {0, 1} to the public. We assume that the informed
citizens can conceal the evidence that the dictator is bad but cannot produce the negative signal if the
dictator is good.
The signal z gets through the censorship with probability (1 − x), where x is the level of censorship. If
the public observes the signal z = 0 from the opposition, it knows for sure that the dictator is incompetent.
If the public observes the absence of a negative signal (we denote this outcome as z = 1), it needs to infer
whether this is because the signal was censored (probability x), or because the true state is θ = 1, or because
nobody wanted to join the opposition (α = 1) as all the informed citizens were co-opted.

Dictator’s payoff

The dictator minimizes the probability of regime change. He does not benefit from higher GDP directly,
just through increased resources to buy support and fund propaganda and censorship.
3.5.2

Citizens’ payoff

The public maximizes current consumption, C, plus expected future consumption. Future consumption is

either δθ, if the current dictator stays, or δ θ̄ − K , if the regime is changed. Here, δ is the discounted
payoff of having a competent (rather than incompetent) dictator in the future. If the regime is changed, the
new dictator is drawn from the same distribution; hence the expected quality is θ̄. Regime change involves
a non-trivial, additional cost to citizens, K.
The co-opted informed citizens (pro-regime elite) receive additional current consumption of r per capita.

Assumptions

We assume that the dictator can commit to the contracts with the elites. In Section 4.3 we discuss why this
assumption is reasonable given that the elite members fully observe both the type of the dictator and the
economic outcomes.

equilibrium. This assumption is realistic but not innocuous. The dictator cannot fully silence the elites
through censorship while he may still fully silence them through co-optation.

11

To focus on more interesting cases, we also assume that K < θ̄, so that if the public knows with certainty
that the dictator is incompetent, it prefers to replace the dictator.

Analysis

b Pb, δ, and K, we find the
In this Section, we solve for equilibria. Given the parameters θ̄, ξ1 , ξ0 , ∆Y , I, X,
equilibrium strategies of the dictator (C, x, P , r), of the informed citizens (to get co-opted or to join the
opposition), and of the public (to protest or to support the regime).
All agents are rational and maximize their expected payoffs given the available information. In particular,
the informed citizens’ choice is contingent on the rewards, r, offered for loyalty.
The general public observes consumption, C, and the signals p and z. If at least one of the two latter
signals is low (p = 0 or z = 0), the public knows with certainty that the dictator is incompetent and
protests. If both signals are high p = z = 1, then the decision depends on the consumption level, C: the
public protests if consumption is low and supports the regime if consumption is high. Therefore, its strategy
is fully described by the consumption threshold C ∗ such that the public supports the regime if and only if
it observes p = z = 1 and C ≥ C ∗ .
We first describe the best response functions of the three players and then solve for the equilibria.

4.1
4.1.1

Players’ best response strategies
Public’s choice

The general public maximizes

U P = C + δ max E(θ|C, p, z); θ̄ − K .
where E(θ|C, p, z) is the expected value of θ given the public’s inference of the equilibrium strategies of
other players and the observed values of C, p, z. Therefore, the public chooses C ∗ as the lowest level of
consumption that satisfies
E(θ|C ∗ , p = z = 1) ≥ θ̄ − K.

(2)

The public does not protest if and only if C ≥ C ∗ and p = z = 1.
4.1.2

Informed citizens’ choice

The informed citizens choose whether to join the opposition or to get co-opted. They make decisions given
the strategies of the dictator and of the general public. They infer the probability of the regime surviving
as a function of the size of the pro-regime elite and of the opposition, Π(α). The latter is a monotonically
increasing function Π0 (α) > 0: the fewer people are in the opposition, the less likely is the opposition signal

12

to reach the public, and (for a given realization of Y and the dictator’s choice of propaganda, P , censorship,
x, and rewards, r) the less likely is the public to overthrow the dictator.
If an informed citizen of mass dα accepts to be co-opted, she gets:9
U C = C + rdα + Π(α + dα)δθ + (1 − Π(α + dα))δ(θ̄ − K).
If she joins the opposition, she gets:
U O = C + Π(α)δθ + (1 − Π(α))δ(θ̄ − K).
The trade-off is straightforward. By joining the opposition, the informed citizen decreases the odds of the

incumbent staying in power—but loses the reward, r. The returns to regime change are: δ θ − (θ̄ − K) .


Therefore, an informed citizen joins the opposition if and only if r < δΠ0 (α) (θ̄ − K) − θ . It is immediately clear that if the true type is high θ = 1, the right hand side is negative and nobody wants to join the
opposition. A competent dictator does not need to offer any rewards.
If the dictator is incompetent (θ = 0), then all the informed public joins the opposition if and only if the
co-optation rewards are sufficiently low: r < r∗ . Here
r∗ ≡ δΠ0 (α)(θ̄ − K).

(3)

Therefore, if the dictator is incompetent,
α(r) = 1{r ≥ r∗ }.
4.1.3

Dictator’s choice: censorship, rewards, propaganda

The dictator learns his type, θ, observes Y and chooses the strategies: censorship (x), rewards (r), and
propaganda (P ). He maximizes his probability of staying in power, π. Given the decisions made by the
dictator (r, x, and P ), the expected probability of staying in power depends on the type of the dictator. We
will consider the competent and incompetent dictator separately.
4.1.3.1

Solving the competent dictator’s problem

If the dictator is competent, there is no opposition in equilibrium: β = 0. A competent dictator therefore
never uses rewards, censorship or propaganda: P = R = X = 0. For him, the propaganda signal is p = 1
with probability 1 and consumption is C = C1 (Y ) ≡ Y . The probability of staying in power is therefore
π1 = 1{Y ≥ C ∗ }.
9 As

we show later, in equilibrium Π(α) is continuous and differentiable.

13

(4)

4.1.3.2

Solving the incompetent dictator’s problem

If the dictator is incompetent, the probability of staying in power is:10
π0 = [1 − (1 − x)(1 − α(r))] Λ(P )1{C ≥ C ∗ }

(5)

Indeed, the probability of z = 1 is 1 − (1 − x)(1 − α(r)), and the probability of p = 1 is Λ(P ).
The equation (5) implies that returns to censorship increase in propaganda and decrease in rewards. In
other words, censorship and co-optation are substitutes, and propaganda is complementary to both. This
property is not derived by assumption but follows from the nature of the public’s statistical inference problem.
Now consider the incompetent dictator’s optimization problem. We will maximize (5) in two steps. First,
the dictator will choose the level of consumption C = C0 (Y ) and therefore the total budget, B = Y − C0 (Y ),
for propaganda, censorship and rewards. Second, given the choice of consumption and budget, B, he will
choose the x, P , and r that maximize the probability, ρ, of p = z = 1 as a function of the budget:
ρ(B) =

The choice of rewards for co-optation is binary: either (i) high rewards r = r∗ (and R = R∗ ≡ r∗ I), or
(ii) no rewards r = 0 (and R = 0). Indeed, the rewards 0 < r < r∗ are suboptimal for the dictator relative
to r = 0 — they do not reduce the number of opposition activists but are costly. The rewards r > r∗ are
also suboptimal for the same reason.
The dictator can choose high rewards only if R∗ ≤ B. In this case, he spends R = R∗ ; censorship is
useless (as there is no opposition), so all remaining resources are spent on propaganda: P = B − R∗ . The
probability of p = z = 1 is:

Incompetent dictator’s choice of consumption

In equilibrium, the choice of consumption C0 (Y ) should solve:
C0 (Y ) = arg max ρ(Y − C)1{C ≥ C ∗ }
C

(10)

Since ρ(B) is strictly increasing in B, the dictator will always choose C = C ∗ and B = Y − C ∗ .

4.2

Equilibria

As the competent dictator always sets C = Y , it is easy to show that there can be two kinds of equilibria.
First, C ∗ = Y L , and the competent dictator always stays in power. The incompetent dictator is overthrown if Y = Y L . However, if Y = Y H he stays in power and spends B = Y H − Y L = ∆Y on rewards,
censorship and propaganda and therefore assures p = z = 1 with a non-trivial probability ρ(∆Y ).
Second, C ∗ = Y H , and the competent dictator only stays in power if Y = Y H ; the incompetent dictator
is overthrown with probability 1.
Can there be equilibria with C ∗ < Y L ? This is impossible as the public knows that if it observes C < Y L ,
the dictator must be incompetent. So it makes sense to replace this dictator with probability 1.
Similarly, there cannot be equilibria with C ∗ ∈ (Y L , Y H ). In this case, if the public observes such a C ∗
and p = z = 1, it knows with certainty that the dictator is incompetent (and lucky).
4.2.1

Equilibrium with C ∗ = Y H

The equilibrium with C ∗ = Y H exists whenever the inferred quality of a dictator with C = Y L is below the
potential alternative θ̄ − K.

In equilibrium, none of the informed citizens joins the opposition, the co-optation rewards are infinitesimal,
there is no censorship, and the incompetent dictator with Y = Y H spends ∆Y on propaganda.
In this equilibrium, the incompetent dictator survives with probability 0 while the competent dictator
survives with probability ξ1 . The intuition is as follows: when the public observes p = z = 1 and C = Y L , it
15

understands that it is very likely that the dictator is incompetent and is spending a great deal of resources
(∆Y , which must be sufficiently large) on propaganda. Notice that there is no opposition: the informed
citizens, understanding that the dictator will be overthrown anyway, accept to be co-opted even if the rewards
are close to zero. Given that there is full co-optation, the dictator spends nothing on censorship. Finally, as
the total co-optation rewards are trivial, the dictator spends all of ∆Y on propaganda.
4.2.2

Equilibrium with C ∗ = Y L

In this equilibrium, the competent dictator always survives, while the incompetent dictator only survives if
Y = Y H . In the latter case, he spends ∆Y on propaganda, censorship and co-optation.
The properties of this equilibrium depend critically on the relative costs of co-optation and propaganda,
which is captured by the following parameter:
a≡

δ(θ̄ − K)I
.
Pb

(12)

The co-optation rewards are endogenous in equilibrium; one of their key determinants is the informed citizens’
long-term cost of not revealing the dictator’s incompetence. There are I informed citizens, and each knows
that replacing an incompetent dictator would improve her own welfare by δ(θ̄ − K). Therefore, δ(θ̄ − K)I
is the opportunity cost for the informed citizens of remaining silent—which will be the minimum reward
they will require for co-optation. The denominator, Pb, is how much it costs the incompetent dictator to
generate a positive propaganda signal with probability 1; in other words, raising the probability of p = 1 by
1 percentage point costs the dictator 0.01Pb.
In this equilibrium, the general public should believe that the average type of the dictator with C =

C = Y L and p = z = 1 is weakly better than regime change:

Equilibria with C ∗ = Y L only exist if ∆Y is sufficiently small. Indeed, if ∆Y is large, the public knows
that the incompetent dictator—if lucky—can spend substantial resources for assuring p = z = 1. Hence
observing p = z = 1 and C = C ∗ , citizens still decide to protest.
Multiple equilibria. If a > 2 and if ∆Y is sufficiently small (satisfying both (14), (15) and (17)), then
we have two stable equilibria — one with propaganda and co-optation (α = 1) and one with propaganda and
censorship (α = 0). Comparing (16) and (18) we find that whenever both equilibria exist, the probability of
survival is higher in the equilibrium with co-optation.
Figure 1 presents the structure of equilibria under different values of parameters (if conditions (15) and
(17) are not binding—e.g. if (1 − ξ1 )/ξ0 is very high).
These equilibria (where C ∗ = Y L ) can also co-exist with the equilibrium with C ∗ = Y H (indeed, for some
parameter values both conditions (11) and (15) are satisfied). In the latter equilibria, the public, observing
a positive signal p = z = 1 and low consumption, infers that the expected quality of the dictator is too low
and protests. As the informed citizens understand that the dictator will be removed anyway, they know that
their information will have no impact and are therefore happy to be co-opted even if rewards are low. Thus,

17

achieving the outcome with p = z = 1 and C ∗ = Y L is relatively cheap for the dictator. So the public’s
inference is justified. For the same parameter values, there may exist an equilibrium with C ∗ = Y L in which
informed citizens do have an impact on the dictator’s survival probability; in this case, co-opting them is
costly. Hence, observing the outcome p = z = 1 and C ∗ = Y L , the public infers that the expected type of
the dictator is relatively high.

4.3

Discussion of the results

The previous analysis yields four main results.
First, if economic volatility (the difference between good and bad economic states, ∆Y ) is not very high,
the incompetent dictator can survive in equilibrium. The logic is as follows. If ∆Y is low, that means that
an incompetent dictator who is lucky enough to experience a good economic outcome (Y = Y H ) will have
only a small amount of extra resources, ∆Y , to spend on propaganda, censorship, and co-optation. As a
result, the messages received by the public should be relatively accurate. Thus, if the public does receive
the positive signals p = z = 1, it will tend to believe them and think the incumbent is competent, even if
consumption is low: C = Y L .
However, if volatility is high, then no equilibrium with C = Y L exists and the incompetent dictator is
overthrown. The impact of economic volatility is especially important in the dynamic setting (see section
5.2): we show that when volatility is low, the dictator is less likely to survive the initial period; but, if he
does, he is then more likely to remain in power for a long time.
This result may also be interpreted in a cross-sectional sense. If the public notices that other comparable
countries are doing much better (∆Y is high), they infer that their dictator may well have diverted a lot of
resources (∆Y ) into propaganda, censorship, and co-optation. As a result, they stop believing the positive
signals, conclude that the dictator is probably bad, and take to the streets to protest.
The second result is the multiplicity of equilibria. For some parameter values there exist two equilibria:
(i) an equilibrium with co-optation, in which the elite agrees to stay silent in return for rewards, and (ii) an
equilibrium with censorship, in which all informed citizens join the opposition but the dictator attempts to
block their media communications.
The multiplicity of equilibria is driven by the ‘fiscal externality’ imposed by the elite members on each
other. Consider the equilibrium with co-optation α = 1. Every informed citizen is happy to stay in the
pro-regime camp, receiving r∗ for not joining the opposition. But now imagine that some informed citizens
(of mass β̃ > 0) join the opposition. In this case, the dictator spends r∗ β̃ less on rewards and reallocates
the money to propaganda and censorship, increasing x and P . How does that change the returns to joining
the opposition for the remaining 1 − β̃ members of the elite? These returns are related to Π0 (α), which in
turn is proportional to (1 − x)P : the payoff to joining the opposition decreases in censorship and increases
in propaganda.
Thus, the defection of some informed citizens has two opposite effects. On the one hand, the increase
in censorship reduces the odds that an anti-regime message will get through. This lowers the payoff to
18

joining the opposition. On the other hand, the increase in propaganda makes it less likely the general public
will learn of the dictator’s incompetence—and thus all the more important for informed citizens to try to
communicate it. This raises the payoff to joining the opposition. Which effect dominates will depend on the
parameters. If the former effect is stronger, no additional members of the elite defect, and the co-optation
equilibrium holds. But if the latter effect dominates, then the initial departures set off a spiral of defections,
ending in the equilibrium with censorship and no co-optation.
Therefore, for some parameter values, only one equilibrium exists, and for other parameter values, two
equilibria exist (see Figure 1).
The third result concerns how the dictator’s various instruments interact. As seen in (5), censorship and
co-optation of the elite are substitutes, while propaganda is complementary to both of them. Returns to
censorship and co-optation increase with propaganda. But higher spending on censorship decreases incentives
for co-optation. These interactions emerge endogenously due to the public’s statistical inference based on
the information it receives.
Finally, we see that whenever both the equilibrium with co-optation and that with censorship exist,
the dictator’s survival probability is always higher in the former. This result follows from the fundamental
asymmetry between these two equilibria.
In the equilibrium with co-optation, the dictator can always deviate to the equilibrium with censorship
by offering zero rewards r = 0. Whatever the elite’s original beliefs and therefore required rewards r∗ , if the
dictator offers r = 0 < r∗ , the elite members reject and join the opposition. This is why the equilibrium with
co-optation can only exist if it delivers a higher probability of survival than equilibrium with censorship.
On the other hand, in the equilibrium with censorship the elites would only get co-opted if r∗ is sufficiently
high (greater than the right-hand side in (9)). The dictator cannot unilaterally deviate from censorship to
co-optation by offering a lower reward: the elites would not agree to be co–opted.
This result implies that a dictator can get stuck in an inferior yet stable equilibrium, relying on a relatively
ineffective instrument (censorship rather than co-optation) to stay in power.
In the analysis above, we have assumed that the dictator can commit to the co-optation contracts with
the elite members. If he promises to pay r for co-optation at time 2, and the elite members send the signal
z = 1 at time 3, he does pay at time 4. This assumption does not matter for the equilibrium with censorship
(as r = 0 anyway). However, it is crucial for the equilibrium with co-optation. If this assumption does not
hold, a promise of any positive r > 0 is not credible. One way to justify this assumption is to consider a
repeated games version of the model. Although we do not model this explicitly, the co-optation contracts can
be sustained by grim trigger strategies. The elite members observe the type of the ruler and the economic
outcomes, so they fully understand whether the dictator sticks to the co-optation contracts or reneges. If he
reneges once, they switch to the censorship equilibrium and the dictator cannot return to the co-optation
equilibrium (which delivers a higher probability of survival).

Comparative statics and extensions

5.1

Comparative statics

How do the exogenous parameters affect the dictator’s survival probability? While the model has nine
b ξ0 and ξ1 ), the structure of equilibria with C ∗ = Y L depends on just two
parameters (∆Y , θ̄, K, I, δ, Pb, X,
combinations of them: a =

δ(θ̄−K)I
b
P

and

∆Y
b
4X

.

The parameter ∆Y is the ex ante economic volatility. From (16) and (18), we see that the dictator’s
survival probability in both the possible equilibria, ρ(∆Y ), increases in ∆Y (although this is not necessarily
true in a multi-period model, see Section 5.2). The reason is simple: the higher is ∆Y , the more resources an
incompetent dictator can spend on censorship, co-optation and propaganda in a given period when Y = Y H .
Not surprisingly, this translates into a higher probability of survival—as long as the equilibrium exists.
Parameter a captures the cost of co-optation relative to the cost of propaganda. If a increases then the
equilibrium with censorship is more likely to exist, while the equilibrium with co-optation is less likely to
exist. (This can be seen as we shift the curves in Figure 1 in response to change in a; indeed

1
1+a

decreases

a

increases in a). This result also allows comparing large and small countries. As the country
size increases, the effectiveness of propaganda per capita grows; so Pb falls and a increases. This makes the
in a and

a−1

equilibrium with co-optation deliver lower survival probability (relative to the equilibrium with censorship)
and less likely to exist.
b increases then both equilibria are more likely to exist—the public understands that censorship is
If X
not cost-effective so a good signal, if received, is more likely to be true. If the censorship equilibrium exists,
b reduces the dictator’s survival odds (see 18): his censorship becomes less effective. But if the
a higher X
censorship cost rises too high, this equilibrium no longer exists and instead the equlibrium with co-optation
will hold. Recall that in the co-optation equilibrium, the dictator’s survival probability is always higher.
Paradoxically, an incompetent dictator is better off if he has an extremely ineffective apparatus of censorship.
High censorship costs may serve as a commitment device, allowing the dictator to achieve an equilibrium
that he prefers.
If the alternative regime is competent and revolution is not too costly (high (θ̄ −K)), then the equilibrium
with censorship is more likely and that with co-optation less likely. The intuition is straightforward: for
members of the elite, the returns to removing the incompetent dictator are high, and so silencing them with
rewards is expensive. As a result, the dictator prefers to use censorship. By the same logic, if the elite cares
more about the future (higher δ), bribing it to accept an incompetent incumbent costs more, so censorship
is favored.
What happens if the cost of propaganda, Pb, falls? Interestingly, a goes up and the equilibrium with cooptation becomes less likely (while the equilibrium with censorship becomes more likely). The lower the cost
of propaganda, the more likely the public will get a convincing propaganda signal. This makes the signals
of the opposition more important, and renders the informed elite harder to co-opt, increasing the odds the

20

dictator will use censorship instead. For example, an external enemy threatens the state’s security, this may
help the incumbent to dodge blame for poor economic performance, rendering his propaganda claims more
believable. If so, the equilibrium with co-optation could disappear, leaving only that with censorship.
One consequence of economic modernization is to broaden the informed elite, increasing I. In the current setting, this makes co-opting the elite more expensive, and thus favors the equilibrium with censorship.
b rather than remaining fixed,
However, it may be more intuitive to suppose that the cost of censorship, X,
b is proportional to I, it is easy to check that an increase in I makes
also increases with I. If, for instance, X
both equilibria less likely to exist. Indeed, higher I raises the costs of both co-opting and censoring. Since
propaganda cannot substitute for censorship and rewards (propaganda is a complement rather than a substitute for both), incompetent dictators face more problems whatever they do. As suggested by “modernization
theory,” broader access to information (or education) renders dictatorships less likely to survive.

5.2

Dynamics

We consider here a multi-period version of the model. We assume that the economic and informational
environment does not change over time (in particular, we do not allow either the dictator or the citizens to
save or borrow). The only state variable that does evolve over time, t, is the public’s beliefs, θet , about the
type of the dictator at time t. Initially, the beliefs are the same as in the one-period model above θe0 = θ̄.
After each period, if the dictator survives, the public rationally updates its beliefs about him. We will assume
that the alternative regime’s quality, θ̄ − K, is constant over time. The informed citizens do not update their
views as they learn the dictator’s type precisely in the initial period.
We first consider the dynamics of equilibrium with C ∗ = Y H . In this equilibrium, if the dictator survives
after the first period, the public knows with certainty that the dictator is competent. Therefore in all future
periods θet = 1 > θ̄ − K, so there are no protests.
The dynamics of the equilibrium with C ∗ = Y L are more complicated. With probability ξ0 ρ(∆Y ) the
incompetent dictator survives. Each period, the public compares its current expectation of the dictator’s
type θet with the alternative θ̄ − K. If the dictator survives, the expectation θet evolves over time according
to the following Bayesian updating formula:
θet+1 =

θet (1 − ξ1 )
= θet +
θet (1 − ξ1 ) + (1 − θet )ξ0 ρ(∆Y )

θet (1 − θet ) (1 − ξ1 − ξ0 ρ(∆Y ))
θet (1 − ξ1 ) + (1 − θet )ξ0 ρ(∆Y )

(19)

Therefore, θet increases over time if and only if the following condition holds
ξ0 ρ(∆Y ) ≤ 1 − ξ1

(20)

If this is the case, the probability of survival in each particular period ξ0 ρ(∆Y ) is rather low. However, if
the dictator does survive, next period the public raises its expectation regarding the type of the dictator.
On the contrary, if ξ0 ρ(∆Y ) > 1 − ξ1 , the public downgrades its beliefs every period according to (19).
21

Eventually, at a certain (finite) time t = t∗ the belief θet falls below θ̄ − K, and the incompetent dictator is
removed with probability 1.
Proposition 3. Suppose that at time t = 0 the economy is in an equilibrium with C ∗ = Y L and ρ(∆Y ).
If condition (20) holds, the incompetent dictator survives each period with probability ξ0 ρ(∆Y ). His expected

If condition (20) does not hold, then there exists some finite time t∗ > 1 such that θet∗ < θ̄ − K ≤ θet∗ −1 .

The distinction between these two cases is especially interesting given that ρ(∆Y ) is different in the
equilibria with co-optation and censorship. For the same values of parameters, there may co-exist two
equilibria: an equilibrium with co-optation (where ρ(∆Y ) is high) and an equilibrium with censorship (where
it is low). It may be the case that in the censorship equilibrium, condition (20) holds while in the co-optation
equilibrium, it does not. In this case, the dynamics will be as follows: in the co-optation equilibrium, the
probability of surviving in each given period is higher (conditional on a particular belief) but the beliefs
are downgraded each period and eventually the dictator is overthrown with certainty. In the censorship
equilibrium, per-period survival is less likely, but beliefs are always adjusted upwards, so this equilibrium
will continue indefinitely.
The ex ante economic volatility ∆Y is also important. If ∆Y is low, the public knows that condition (20)
holds, and a positive public signal p = z = 1 implies that the probability of the dictator being competent
is high. So if he survives for another period, his reputation improves and he is even likelier to last for
yet another period. Conversely, if ∆Y is high, the public knows that an incompetent dictator could be
spending a lot on propaganda and censorship. Hence, each period, the public downgrades the reputation
of the surviving incumbent. Eventually, this reputation sinks so low that the public protests against the
dictator even if it observes a positive signal p = z = 1 .
The binary nature of the shocks renders the dynamics simple to analyze but it also rules out any dynamic
effect of change in beliefs on the choice of consumption. In this model, consumption is always equal either
to Y H (if the dictator is competent and lucky) or to Y L . In section 6, we consider a model with continuous
economic shocks. There, an increase in θ̄ results in lower consumption in equilibrium. If the expected type of
the dictator is high, the incompetent dictator can get away with lower C. In such a setting, increases in θet —
i.e. a trend towards greater perceived competence in government—are accompanied by falling consumption.
For simplicity’s sake, we have assumed away savings and investment. If the public were able to save, the
divergence result above would be reinforced. Indeed, if the public believes that the dictator is more likely to
be competent, the returns to investment increase, and the public invests more today, thus increasing GDP
tomorrow. This helps the incompetent dictator tomorrow to reallocate more resources towards co-optation,
censorship, and propaganda, thus further improving his reputation. Conversely, if the dictator’s reputation
22

is low, the public invests less, GDP is not likely to grow, and the dictator will have less resources to spend
on co-optation, censorship, and propaganda. His reputation will be downgraded even faster and he is likely
to be removed from office sooner.
What would happen if, instead of the public, the dictator were able to save? If the savings were observable, the dictator would use them as a credible signal of his competence. Indeed, a more competent dictator
has a longer expected time in office and therefore a stronger incentive to save for the future relative to the
incompetent dictator. However, in equilibrium, a (lucky) incompetent dictator would pool with the competent dictator and also save. This would decrease his budget for co-optation, censorship, and propaganda in
the current period and therefore reduce his chance to hold on to power.
If the savings were not observed, this effect would weaken but would still exist. Suppose the dictator has
access to frictionless financial markets and the public has a consumption-smoothing motive. A competent
dictator would always choose C = Ȳ1 ≡ (1 − ξ1 Y L ) + ξ1 Y H . Therefore the incompetent dictator will also
have to deliver C = Ȳ1 . However, as his expected income is only Ȳ0 ≡ (1 − ξ0 Y L ) + ξ0 Y H , each period his
debt will increase—in expected terms—by Ȳ1 − Ȳ0 = (ξ1 − ξ0 )∆Y . Eventually, this debt will be impossible
to hide (or the creditors will stop lending to the dictator).

5.3

Repressing the protesters

In this Section we consider an extension where in addition to co-optation, censorship, and propaganda the
dictator can also use repression. By allocating certain resources to the riot police and military, the dictator
can increase the cost of regime change, K. The potential protesters do not observe this cost but can infer
the dictator’s optimal choice.
What is the effect of adding a fourth instrument to the dictator’s repertoire? Now the dictator can choose
to reduce spending on censorship, rewards and propaganda, B = X + R + P , and use the savings, ∆Y − B,
to increase K. The latter matters as it directly affects the parameter a, which, in turn, determines the cost
of rewards and therefore the structure of equilibria (see Figure 1).
Suppose that the dictator spends G on repressive capacity. He sets the level at the same time that he
allocates the budgets for censorship, X, rewards, R, and propaganda, P . We will assume that the repression
b and that G
b > ∆Y /θ̄; this implies that repression is sufficiently costly so that
technology is linear, K = G/G,
the dictator cannot achieve K = θ̄. This assumption is reasonable—indeed, if the dictator could achieve
θ̄ − K = 0, he would always do so and would never use other instruments as the public would never have an
incentive to replace him.
We now need to reproduce the analysis of the equilibria replacing B = ∆Y with B = ∆Y − G and a with
b
a(G) = δI(θ̄ − G/G).
Consider first the equilibria with rewards (α = 1). This equilibrium exists if ∆Y −G <

The higher

the level of repression G, the likelier this inequality is to hold. Therefore, repression makes this equilibrium
more likely to exist. However, given that it exists, the the probability of survival ρ(∆Y − G) =

23

∆Y −G

decreass monotonically with G. This is because repression is not cost-effective—it makes more sense to spend
money on rewards and propaganda.11
Consequently, if the equilibrium without repression exists, the dictator does not spend anything on
repression. However, if the equilibrium without repression does not exist, the dictator is better-off spending
just enough on repression to assure that this equilibrium exists. Suppose that a(0) < 2 and ∆Y >

b
4X
1+a(0) .

Then without any repression, the equilibrium unravels and the dictator is removed from office with probability
1. In this case, he would benefit from choosing the minimum level of repression that satisfies:

(21)

This level of repression is the smaller root of the corresponding quadratic equation.12 This solution always
exists (at G = 0, the left-hand side of (21) is greater than the right-hand side, while at G = ∆Y the left-hand
side is zero while the right-hand side is positive).
Given this level of repression, the dictator survives with a non-trivial probability ρ(∆Y −G) =

b
4X
b(1+a(G))2 .
P

The intuition is simple. The dictator understands that without any investment in repressive capacity, the
elite is too costly to silence. So he uses some repression to make sure that the elite is less interested in regime
change and is therefore cheaper to bribe. This allows him to free up additional resources for propaganda
and therefore make ends meet in equilibrium.
Now consider the equilibrium with censorship (α = 0). In this equilibrium, the probability of survival
decreases in the level of repression: ρ(∆Y − G) =

This level of repression is also the smaller root of the quadratic equation.13 Unlike in the case of the
equilibrium with co-optation, the solution does not always exist. If parameters are such that the quadratic
equation has no roots, then no level of repression will ensure the existence of equilibrium.
Thus, spending on repression against potential protesters cannot increase the probability of survival in
11 This result holds as the repression technology is linear. In the non-linear case, there may be a non-trivial amount of
repression in equilibrium.

of equilibrium. This rationale for repression works when ∆Y is sufficiently high. In this case, the economic
decline is so large that the public does not believe the propaganda any more; hence the dictator prefers to
spend money on repression.

5.4

Repressing the elites

Would an incompetent dictator ever choose to repress members of the elite? So far, we have assumed r ≥ 0;
the dictator can only reward loyal members of the elite but cannot punish disloyal ones. In this section, we
allow for both positive and negative incentives. Suppose that at time 2, the dictator makes an offer to each
member of the elite: if the elite member agrees to be co-opted, he receives a reward r > 0; otherwise he is
repressed and therefore suffers a loss of q ≥ 0.
In order to be credible, the dictator has to commit Q = qI “units” of repression at time 2. We assume
that the dictator assigns repression resources to each potential opposition member already at time 2; these
may include personalized surveillance, investigators focused on individual elite members etc. Therefore, at
time 2, each individual elite member understands that the dictator has the capacity to repress him and
repression will follow if he joins the opposition.14
For simplicity, we assume away the financial cost of repression. However, repressing the elite involves an
b the general public observes the act of repression; this reveals that
additional risk as with probability Q/Q
b is an exogenous parameter, which measures
the dictator is incompetent, and the public revolts.15 Here Q
the “quantity” of repression that changes the probability of repression being noticed by the public from zero
to one.
The equilibrium with censorship does not change.

Indeed, in this equilibrium, using repression is

counterproductive—the elite joins the opposition anyway and extra repression just risks revealing the dictator’s incompetence to the public without providing any benefit.
Some non-trivial investment in repression may emerge in the equilibrium with co-optation. Here, the
investment in repression capacity allows the dictator to save on co-optation rewards. Indeed, the elite’s
incentive constraint is r + q ≥ δΠ0 (α)(θ̄ − K). The higher the potential repression, q, the less reward, r,
is needed to keep the elite co-opted. However, more repression means a higher risk of public exposure.
Therefore, the incompetent dictator’s problem becomes:
ρ(∆Y ) =

14 We can also consider a more general setting allowing for differential intensity of repression against different elite members.
In our simple model, however, the dictator would always choose the same level of repression, q, for each elite member in
equilibrium.
15 A similar argument, of course, applies to co-optation and censorship. These are also never employed by a competent dictator.
Hence, co-optation and censorship are used only to the extent that they can be concealed. We assume that co-optation and
censorship are much easier to hide than repression. Indeed, by definition, censorship allows hiding information about the very
fact of censorship. Similarly, if the public observes payments to the elite, the dictator can plausibly claim to be paying members
of the elite for legitimate services.

where ∆Y is the total budget for censorship, propaganda, and co-optation (recall that repression involves
no cost), and where R∗ = δIΠ0 (α)(θ̄ − K).

In order to complete the description of the equilibrium with co-optation, we need to use Π0 (α) = ρ(∆Y )
so R∗ = δI(θ̄ − K)ρ(∆Y ) = a Pbρ(∆Y ). Finally, the strategies above are equilibrium strategies if and only
if the dictator does not gain from deviating to R = Q = 0, using only censorship and propaganda. In other
words, for each of the three cases above, we need to compare ρ(∆Y ) with

The analysis above implies that if the equilibrium with co-optation existed in the original model, it will
b ≥ (1 + a)∆Y (corresponding to the case (iii) above). If this condition does not
continue to exist as long as Q
b
hold, there will be a non-trivial amount of repression in the equilibrium with co-optation. If Q/∆Y
is very
b
low then the dictator will only use repression and no rewards (case i) above). If Q/∆Y takes intermediate
values, then the equilibrium with co-optation involves both rewards and the threat of repression against the
elites: R > 0, Q > 0 (case (ii)).
Case (iii) implies that if repression against the elites is possible but is quite likely to be observed then the
equilibrium involves neither repression nor even the threat of repression: Q = 0. The equilibrium is exactly
the same as in the original model.
In the analysis above we assumed that repression of the elite is not costly and is limited only by the
fact that it is hard to conceal. The model in which repression is also financially costly—and therefore has
to be funded at the expense of the public’s consumption—is more involved but has similar properties. In
particular, for a range of parameters, repression is not used in equilibrium: Q = 0 (as in case (iii) above);
the higher the financial cost of repression, the larger is this range of parameters.

5.5

Other extensions

Our model assumes linear technologies for propaganda, censorship, and co-optation. In particular, there are
no non-linearities in the responses of informed citizens to the amount spent on propaganda. If the dictator
spends less on propaganda, the informed citizens understand that their opposition messages will have a lower
26

impact, and so the cost to co-opt them declines proportionally. This is why both equilibria with co-optation
and with censorship exist when ∆Y is small (so that spending on propaganda, P ≤ B ≤ ∆Y , is also small).
In reality, the informed citizens’ choice may be non-linear. There could be a fixed cost of allowing oneself
to be co-opted (due to the “moral cost of opportunism”) or a fixed cost of joining the opposition (e.g., a
limited jail term). A non-trivial moral cost would make the equilibrium with co-optation disappear for small
∆Y . Indeed, if the total budget for co-optation and propaganda, B = R + P = ∆Y , is small, the dictator
will not be able to afford to compensate all members of the elite for the moral cost of co-optation.
Meanwhile, a jail term for opposition activists might eliminate the equilibrium with censorship at low
values of ∆Y . In this case, as the total budget for co-optation and propaganda, B = X + P = ∆Y , is low,
spending on propaganda, P = ∆Y /2. Therefore for each member of the informed elite the benefits from
joining the opposition are low—they are proportional to the impact on the dictator’s survival probability,
and this impact is, in turn, proportional to the level of propaganda. Hence if ∆Y is sufficiently low, the
benefits of joining the opposition fall below the fixed cost of a jail term, and the equilibrium unravels.
We have implicitly assumed that acts of both censorship and repression cannot be directly observed by
the public. Since competent incumbents never censor or repress, observing the dictator doing one of these
things would immediately reveal the incumbent to be incompetent. One might think of such revelations as
endogenously increasing the size of I. If enough people observed such behavior, this might set off a spiral
of opposition activism and protest. There are, indeed, noted cases in which the use of excessive violence by
the regime, or the discovery of a grizzly murder for which the regime was blamed, catalyzed opposition to
it rather than intimidating the public. While it is implausible that a single act of violent repression would
automatically undermine a dictatorship, if the model included some noise, then only violence that rose above
a certain threshold would trigger a strong public reaction.

6

The impact of economic shocks

The model sketched so far allows only limited analysis of comparative statics with regard to economic shocks.
In the setting with two output levels, if the incompetent dictator’s output decreases, he is overthrown with
probability one, so his spending on propaganda, censorship, and co-optation are not relevant. In this section,
we consider a setting with a continuous distribution of economic shocks, in which such shocks can have a
non-trivial impact on co-optation, censorship and propaganda.

6.1

Setting

Let us assume that Y is distributed on [Y L , Y H ] with the density function f1 (Y ) if the dictator is competent
and f0 (Y ) if he is incompetent. We assume that the density is positive for all Y ∈ [Y L , Y H ] and that
there are no mass points. Higher output is more likely for the competent types and less likely for the
incompetent types; we assume that f0 (Y ) is a (weakly) monotonically decreasing function and f1 (Y ) is a
(weakly) monotonically increasing function.
27

As the informed citizens observe both the output and the type of the dictator, the game between the
dictator and the informed citizens remains the same. In this game, there is no asymmetric information.
Therefore, the structure of equilibria is similar to that in the previous model: there can be equilbria with
co-optation (α = 1) and with censorship (α = 0). We assume that equilibrium existence conditions (14)
hold so these equilibria exist. We will denote by B(Y ) the total budget for censorship, co-optation and
propaganda as a function of the output (in the model with binary output, B(Y H ) = ∆Y and B(Y L ) did
not matter as the dictator was overthrown anyway).
The model with continuous output has no equilibrium in pure strategies. We therefore consider equilibria
in mixed strategies. In such equilibria, the general public chooses a probability of supporting the dictator
as a function of the observed consumption level γ(C) ∈ [0, 1] (if p = z = 1). If p = 0 or z = 0, the public
knows with certainty that the dictator is incompetent and protests with probability 1.
In equilibrium, the public’s choice of γ(C) is optimal:
γ(C) = 0

if

E(θ|C, p = z = 1) ≤ θ̄ − K,

0 < γ(C) < 1

if

E(θ|C, p = z = 1) = θ̄ − K,

γ(C) = 1

if

E(θ|C, p = z = 1) ≥ θ̄ − K.

As in the model with binary output, it is easy to show that the competent dictator always chooses
C1 (Y ) = Y .
The incompetent dictator faces the following trade-off: if he spends more on propaganda, co-optation
and censorship, the probability is higher that the public will receive the positive signal, p = z = 1; however,
as this spending comes at the cost of lower consumption C, it implies a lower probability of survival given
the positive signal. His choice of consumption level, C0 (Y ), solves the following optimization problem:
C0 (Y ) = arg max γ(C)ρ(Y − C).
0≤C≤Y

Equilibrium

Lemma 1. If the distribution density f1 (·) does not have mass points, there is no equilibrium in pure
strategies. The equilibrium in mixed strategies has the following properties:
1. [(i)]
2. The public’s strategy, γ(C), is weakly monotonic. If γ(C) < 1, it is strictly monotonic. The incompetent
dictator’s strategy, C0 (Y ), is also strictly monotonic.
3. There exists a C ∗∗ ∈ (Y L , Y H ] such that γ(C) = 1 for all C ≥ C ∗∗ ;
4. γ(Y L ) = 0;

28

5. 0 < γ(C) < 1 for all C ∈ (Y L , C ∗∗ ).
6. C0 (Y ) is a differentiable, invertible function. In equilibrium, its first derivative equals
C00 (Y ) =

f0 (Y )ρ(Y − C0 (Y )) (θ̄ − K)(1 − θ̄)
.
f1 (C0 (Y ))
(1 − θ̄ + K)θ̄

(23)

7. In the worst economic outcome, Y = Y L , the incompetent dictator spends all resources on consumption:
C0 (Y L ) = Y L .

(24)

8. Total spending on co-optation, censorship and propaganda, B(Y ) = Y −C0 (Y ), monotonically increases
with Y .
The Lemma implies that both γ(C0 (Y )) and B(Y ) increase with Y ; therefore the higher the realization
of the economic shock, Y , the higher the probability of survival, γ(C0 (Y ))ρ(B(Y )).
In order to find the equilibrium, we need to solve equation (23) given the initial condition (24). To
complete the description of the equlibrium, we should find γ(C) using the first-order condition from (22),
0

(Y −C0 (Y ))
which yields the following differential equation: γ 0 (C0 (Y )) = γ(C0 (Y )) ρρ(Y
−C0 (Y )) . This equation determines

γ(·) up to a scalar multiplier. To find this multiplier, we need to use the boundary condition: γ(C0 (Y H )) = 1.

6.3

Comparative statics

In this section, we carry out the comparative statics analysis with regard to the parameters of the model.
We also compare the behavior of an incompetent dictator in an equilibrium with co-optation with the one
in an equilibrium with censorship.
Proposition 4. Either in equilibrium with co-optation or in equilibrium with censorship, for given distributions f0 (·) and f1 (·), and for a given realization of the economic shock Y , an incompetent dictator spends
b
more on censorship, co-optation and propaganda and less on consumption if K increases, Pb increases, X
increases (in the equilibrium with censorship), δI increases (in the equilibrium with co-optation), or if both
θ̄ and K increase, holding (θ̄ − K) constant.
The intuition for the comparative statics is straightforward. If Pb increases, a dollar spent on propaganda
is less effective than before at rendering a false message convincing. The public therefore increases its
estimate of the incumbent’s competence by more when it receives a convincing message, p = z = 1, even
if the consumption level is somewhat lower. Understanding this, an incompetent dictator has an incentive
to provide a lower level of consumption and spend more on increasing the probability of a positive signal,
b (in the equilibrium with censorship), and for
p = z = 1. Similar logic applies for the cost of censorship, X,
the parameter δI (that determines the size of rewards in the equilibrium with co-optation). An increase in

29

K lowers the expected value of revolution; hence the public will accept a lower consumption level from the
incumbent.
Finally consider the impact of an increase in the expected quality of dictators, θ̄, holding the quality
of the alternative regime θ̄ − K constant. The higher is θ̄, the stronger is the public’s expectation that
the incumbent is competent, and so he can afford a lower level of consumption. This result is especially
important for the analysis of the dynamics. If the dictator is lucky enough to survive the first few periods,
his reputation, θ̄, increases, while the expected quality of the alternative, θ̄ − K, does not change. In
this case, the equilibrium trajectory involves the surviving dictator’s reputation growing over time and the
consumption level declining over time.
We should emphasize that the comparative statics results in Proposition 4 are very different from those
that a naive ‘partial equilibrium’ model would produce. For example, if we did not take into account the
endogenous equilibrium inference of the public, an increase in the cost of propaganda should result in lower
spending on propaganda and higher spending on consumption. However, as the public is rational and can
decipher this logic, the ‘general equilibrium’ result is that a higher cost of propaganda results in lower
consumption and higher spending on propaganda.
Equation (23) also allows us to compare the reaction to economic shocks in equilibria with co-optation
(where ρ(Y − C0 (Y )) is proportional to Y − C0 (Y )) and equilibria with censorship (where ρ(Y − C0 (Y ))
is proportional to (Y − C0 (Y ))2 ). Consider two countries, with the same ex ante distributions of economic
e in both countries, but
shocks, f0 (·) and f1 (·). Suppose that we observe the same output Ye > Y L and same C
that the first country is in the equilibrium with co-optation, while the second one is in the equilibrium with
censorship. Our theory predicts that if these countries are hit by similar economic shocks (e.g., Y declines to
a certain level Ȳ ∈ (Y L , Ye )), then the first country will respond with a lower decrease in consumption (and
a greater decrease in the total budget for co-optation, censorship and propaganda) than the second country.
In other words, regimes with censorship react to negative economic shocks with a greater reallocation of
resources towards censorship, co-optation and propaganda than do regimes with co-optation.
e For any Ȳ ∈ (Y L , Ye ), the decrease in conProposition 5. Consider an equilibrium where C0 (Ye ) = C.
sumption, C0 (Ye ) − C0 (Ȳ ), is smaller if the economy is in the equilibrium with co-optation (both before and
after the decline in Y ) than in the case in which it is in the equilibrium with censorship (both before and
after the decline in Y ).
The intuition for this result is as follows. In the equilibrium with censorship, a given economic deterioration decreases citizens’ consumption—and therefore their belief in the dictator’s competence—by more
than the same economic deterioration does in the equilibrium with co-optation (see Figure 1). Thus, in the
censorship equilibrium, the dictator has to spend relatively more on censorship and propaganda to offset the
induced loss of public confidence when the economy declines.

6.4

Example

To illustrate the propositions stated above, we use a simple example. Let us assume that Y is distributed
on [0, ∆Y ].16 The distribution is uniform for the bad type: f0 (Y ) = 1/∆Y and has linear increasing density
for the good type f1 (Y ) = 2Y /(∆Y )2 .
Let us assume that ∆Y is sufficiently small so that the equilibrium existence conditions (14) are satisfied
(indeed, in this case for all realizations of Y the budget for co-optation, censorship and propaganda, B(Y ) ≤
Y ≤ ∆Y , also satisfies these conditions).
We shall solve (23) for the equilibrium with co-optation (α = 1) and then for the equilibrium with
censorship (α = 0). In the equilibrium with co-optation, ρ(B) =

B
b(1+a) .

Using the boundary condition (24)

(which takes the form C0 (0) = 0), we immediately find a solution for (23):

The solution is therefore simple: if output decreases, the incompetent dictator proportionally decreases
total spending on co-optation and propaganda B(Y ) = (1 − ζ)Y . Moreover, as follows from the Proof of
Proposition 2, spending on co-optation and spending on propaganda also change proportionally: R(Y ) =

This means that in the equilibrium with censorship, the incompetent dictator spends relatively more on
censorship and propaganda as the economy worsens: B(Y )/Y increases as Y falls to zero. In the limit Y → 0,
the share of output spent on censorship and propaganda actually reaches 100 percent: limY →0

B(Y )
Y

= 1.

Conversely, as output grows, the share spent on consumption increases: C0 (Y )/Y is increasing with Y . The
amounts spent on censorship and propaganda in this equilibrium are equal to each other X = P = B(Y )/2.
In proportion to total income, Y , their shares therefore also increase as output falls.
In Figure 2 we present the numerical solution and show that these properties hold for the whole range
of Y and not just in the neigborhood of Y = 0.
16 The lower bound of zero is a normalization to the lowest level of GDP above which income can be diverted to propaganda,
censorship, and co-optation. The analysis for any other interval would be the same but would involve additional notation.

Conclusions

The totalitarian tyrants of the past used mass violence, ideological indoctrination, and closed borders to
monopolize power. In a world of economic interdependence and modern communications technology, many
authoritarian leaders choose a different strategy—that of manipulating information to convince the public
that they are doing a good job. We model the tradeoffs this generates, as dictators choose from a repertoire
of techniques, and citizens exploit the signals inherent in the dictator’s actions to infer his type.
We show that, in this setup, incompetent leaders can survive by manipulating the information environment so long as economic shocks are not too large. In such equilibria, no violent repression—or at most a
very little—is needed. Over time, an incompetent leader who survives may acquire a reputation for competence by virtue of rational Bayesian updating on the part of the public. Major economic downturns destroy
such equilibria, exposing the leader’s incompetence, and generating protests that can only be suppressed by
force.
The coordination problem of members of the informed elite leads to multiple equilibria, in one of which
the dictator focuses on co-optation and in the other of which he relies instead on censorship. Co-optation
and censorship are substitutes—both prevent the elite from publicizing an incumbent’s failures—but state
propaganda is complementary to both. The multiplicity of equilibria may explain why we observe very
different levels of censorship and of patronage in otherwise similar regimes.
We also show that a dictator focused on co-optation reacts to economic shocks differently from one who
is commited to censorship. The latter is more likely to boost propaganda and censorship in response to
an economic downturn than the former. Although we do not explicitly model the use of institutions such
as legislatures, parties, and elections, it is clear that a dictator who succeeds in convincing the public that
32

he is competent can enjoy the benefits of such “democratic” elements without fear of losing power. Such
institutions—which are quite compatible with a strategy of co-optation of the elite—can be used to amplify
the (accurate) perception of the dictator’s popularity.
Our model also explains why in information-based dictatorships violence either is a last resort when all
else has failed, or is used sparingly when it is possible to conceal it. The reason is that the competent
dictators do not need to use repressions. Hence, reverting to repressions immediately reveals the dictator’s
incompetence to the public and ultimately results in his downfall. This is why dictators often find or create
some non-political pretext to imprison leaders of the political opposition. This also explains why dictators
who arrange for the murder of political opponents usually go to great lengths to deny responsibility. If the
goal were merely to intimidate the opposition, then such denials would be baffling—an open acknowledgement
would have a far greater deterrent effect.17
The survival strategies we formalize are more compatible with a modernized society than totalitarian ones
or those of monarchs who rely on traditional legitimacy. Yet, we also show how modernization ultimately
undermines such informational equilibria. As education and information spread to a broader segment of
the population, it becomes harder to control how this informed elite communicates with the masses—either
through co-optation or through censorship.

17 This also explains why those—usually in the security services—who stand to benefit from a regime based on raw repression
may seek to compromise a dictator by committing acts of violence for which he will be blamed. The true goal in such cases
may be to force the dictator to switch from an information-based survival strategy to one based on sheer force. It also suggests
why an incompetent security apparatus can be so dangerous for a dictator. After troops shot the Philippine opposition leader
Benigno Aquino on the tarmac of Manila Airport, it was impossible for President Marcos to deny complicity. This murder
ignited the “People’s Power” movement that eventually prompted a split within Marcos’s military support group and the
collapse of his regime.

Appendix: Proofs
Proof of Proposition 1. Let us calculate the expected value of the type of the dictator that the public
infers when observing p = z = 1 and C = Y L . This outcome is possible if the dictator is competent
(which happens with probability θ̄(1 − ξ1 )) or if the dictator is incompetent with Y H and he spends ∆Y on
censorship, repression and propaganda.
Let us calculate the probability of the incompetent dictator having p = z = 1 and C = Y L . The informed
citizens understand that the incompetent dictator is overthrown with probability 1. Therefore they expect
Π(α) = 0 and Π0 (α) = 0. Hence r∗ = 0 and R∗ = 0 (informed citizens join the pro-regime elite even for
an infinitesimal reward). Thus B̃ = 0, and the dictator does not use censorship, x = 0, and spends all
his resources on propaganda, P = ∆Y . Therefore ρ(∆Y ) = ∆Y /Pb. Consequently, the probability of the
incompetent dictator having p = z = 1 and C = Y L is (1 − θ̄)ξ0 ∆Y /Pb.
The equilibrium exists whenever
E(θ|C = Y L , p = z = 1) =

θ̄(1 − ξ1 )
≤ θ̄ − K
θ̄(1 − ξ1 ) + (1 − θ̄)ξ0 ρ(∆Y )

which can be rewritten as (11).
Notice that ρ(∆Y ) = ∆Y /Pb is the maximum probability for the incompetent dictator to have p = z = 1
and C = Y L ; in this equilibrium the incompetent dictator is overthrown anyway so he is indifferent whether
to maximize this probability or to choose another strategy. However, if he spends less on propaganda
and C > Y L , this equilibrium does not exist. Also, if instead of spending ∆Y , the dictator spends it on
censorship or co-optation—and therefore may have a lower ρ(∆Y ), the condition above may not hold and
the equilibrium no longer exists. Therefore, (11) is a necessary and sufficient condition for equilibrium with
C ∗ = Y H to exist. 
Proof of Proposition 2. Let us first calculate Π0 (α). The expression (6) implies that the derivative of
the probability of achieving p = z = 1 with regard to α is (1 − x)Λ(P ). Therefore
Π0 (α) = E [(1 − x)Λ(P )1{C ≥ C ∗ }] .

This equilibrium is unstable. If in equilibrium α informed citizens are co-opted, and if dα of them then
decide to deviate and join the opposition, the dictator will spend less on co-optation and more on propaganda.
This will immediately increase the informed citizens’ returns to joining the opposition in equilibrium (a higher

38

level of propaganda will increase Π0 (α), so the remaining α−dα will now strictly prefer joining the opposition.

Proof of Lemma 1. Non-existence of equilibrium in pure strategies. Suppose there is an equilibrium in
pure strategies. In this equilibrium, if p = z = 1, the public protests with probability 1 if C < C ∗ and
does not protest with probability 1 if C ≥ C ∗ . Then there exists a certain threshold, Y ∗ , such that the
incompetent dictators with Y ≥ Y ∗ choose C0 (Y ) = C ∗ and survive with probability ρ(Y − C ∗ ). Indeed,
if an incompetent dictator with Y1 chooses C = C ∗ , then any luckier incompetent dictator with Y2 > Y1
will also choose C = C ∗ and spend the additional resources (Y2 − C ∗ ) − (Y1 − C ∗ )Y2 − Y1 on censorship,
co-optation and propaganda. There is no rationale for the dictator with Y2 to increase consumption as it
does not decrease the probability of being overthrown.
The competent dictators still choose C = Y ; there is no incentive for them to spend any money on
censorship, co-optation and propaganda.
Now let us calculate the expected type of the dictator, given observed consumption. If the public observes
∗

C and p = z = 1, it knows that this may be the case if the dictator is competent and Y = C ∗ (which
happens with infinitesimal probability, f1 (C ∗ )dY ), or if the dictator is incompetent and Y ≥ Y ∗ (which
RYH
happens with probability Y ∗ ρ(Y − C ∗ )f0 (Y )dY ). Unless there is a mass point of competent dictators at
Y = C ∗ , the inferred probability that the dictator is good is actually zero—and the public strictly prefers
to overthrow him. Therefore this is not an equilibrium.
Properties of the equilibrium in mixed strategies.
1. [(i)]
2. First, let us show that γ(·) is a monotonically increasing function. Suppose there are two values of
consumption, C1 and C2 , such that C1 < C2 but γ(C1 ) > γ(C2 ). If this is the case, no incompetent
dictator will choose C = C2 . Indeed, if a dictator chooses C2 , he can do better by choosing C = C1 ,
assuring him a higher γ(C) and higher ρ (by spending additional C2 −C1 on propaganda, censorship and
co-optation). Hence, if the public observes C = C2 , it knows that the dictator cannot be incompetent.
Therefore, γ(C2 ) must be equal to 1. But this is impossible since γ(C2 ) < γ(C1 ) ≤ 1.
Similarly, we can prove that γ(C1 ) = γ(C2 ) is only possible if both are equal to 1.
The fact that C0 (Y ) is monotonic directly follows from the monotonic comparative statics of the
optimisation problem (22). As ρ(·) is a linear or quadratic function of Y − C (depending on whether
the equilibrium is the one with co-optation or the one with censorship, respectively), it is easy to show
that the solution of the optimization problem increases with Y . Moreover, if γ(C) < 1, the function
C0 (Y ) strictly increases with Y .
3. If C = Y H and p = z = 1, the public understands that the dictator is competent with probability 1 (if
the dictator is incompetent, he needs to spend a non-trivial amount on propaganda to send a signal
p = 1 so he cannot ensure C = Y H ). Therefore, γ(Y H ) = 1.
39

Let us denote as C ∗∗ the choice of consumption by the incompetent dictator with the highest Y = Y H ,
i.e. C ∗∗ = C0 (Y H ). Then, by definition, for all C ≥ C ∗∗ , the public infers that the dictator is
competent with probability 1, so that γ(C) must be equal to 1.
4. Now we shall prove that γ(Y L ) must be equal to zero. If this is not the case, then there exists a
certain Ye > Y L such that for an incompetent ruler with this Ye it is optimal to spend Ye − Y L on
censorship, co-optation and propaganda. (Indeed, the incompetent dictator with Y = Y L cannot
provide consumption C = Y L and ensure a positive signal p = z = 1). Let us now consider the choices
of incompetent dictators with Y ∈ (Y L , Ye ). Monotonicity of C0 (Y ) implies that they should choose
C0 (Y ) ≤ Y L . If they choose C < Y L , they are ousted with probability 1. Therefore they choose
C = Y L , as this choice gives a positive probability, γ(Y L )ρ(Y − Y L ), to stay in office. Therefore, if
the public observes C = Y L and p = z = 1, it infers the dictator may be competent with Y = Y L or
he may be incompetent with Y ∈ (Y L , Ye ). Since there are no mass points, the conditional probability
of the dictator being competent is infinitesimal. Therefore, E(θ|C = Y L , p = z = 1) = 0, so γ(Y L )
cannot be positive.
5. Now let us prove that there cannot be an equilibrium in which γ(C) = 0 for C > Y L . If it were the
e > Y L such that γ(C) = 0 for all C ∈ [Y L , C]

contradiction, which proves that γ(C) = 0 only for C = Y L .
6. We have already proved in (i) that incompetent dictators with different economic shocks cannot choose
the same consumption level. Therefore, the function C0 (Y ) is invertible, and we can introduce the
inverse function y(C) = C0−1 (C) (in other words, Y = y(C) if and only if C = C0 (Y )).
Let us now calculate the E(θ|C, p = z = 1) given the equilibrium beliefs of the general public about
fθ (Y ) and C0 (Y ). Suppose that the public observes consumption to be in the interval between C and
C + dC. This can be the case if the dictator is competent and has output Y ∈ [Y, Y + dY ]; or it can

40

be the case if the dictator is incompetent and the output is Y ∈ [y(C), y(C) + y 0 (C)dC]. Therefore
E(θ|C, p = z = 1) =

(30)

As E(θ|C, p = z = 1) = θ̄ − K for all C ∈ [Y L , C ∗∗ ], we can obtain a differential equation for y(C):
y 0 (C) =

(1 − θ̄ + K)θ̄
f1 (C)
.
f0 (y(C))ρ(y(C) − C) (θ̄ − K)(1 − θ̄)

This equation implies that y 0 (C) is continuous, which implies that C0 (Y ) is also differentiable and
its derivative is continuous. Using the inverse function theorem y 0 (C)C00 (y(C)) = 1, we can use the
differential equation for y(C) above to obtain the differential equation (23).
7. If y(Y L ) = Ye > Y L , this would be a suboptimal choice for the incompetent dictator with Y = Ye . If
he chooses consumption C = Y L , he will have a zero probability to stay in power, but he could do
better by choosing a certain C ∈ (Y L , Ye ).
8. In order to prove that B(Y ) never decreases with Y , we need to prove that C00 (Y ) = 1 − B 0 (Y ) cannot
be above 1. As C0 (Y L ) = Y L , in the neighborhood of Y = Y L the difference B(Y ) = Y − C0 (Y )
cannot decrease with Y , therefore C00 (Y ) < 1 for all Y sufficiently close to Y L .
Therefore, if C00 (Y ) > 1 at least for some Y , there must exist Y such that C00 (Y ) increases with Y
and C00 (Y ) > 1. However, this is not possible. Indeed, for such Y the left-hand side of (23) increases
in Y while the right-hand side decreases with Y (as B(Y ) is decreasing with Y at this Y , the term
ρ(Y − C0 (Y )) is decreasing in Y , also, f0 (Y ) is decreasing by definition, and f1 (C0 (Y )) is decreasing
as well).

Proof of Proposition 4. Let us consider a differential equation
C00 (Y ) = M Φ(Y, C0 (Y ))

(31)

where M is a constant and Φ(·) is a continuous function. Then a solution of this differential equation on
f > M then
Y ∈ [Y L , Y H ] with the initial condition (24) has the following comparative statics property: if M
e0 (Y ) is above the original solution C0 (Y ). Indeed, the equation
for each Y > Y H the respective solution C
e0 (Y ) > C0 (Y ) at least in some neighborhood of Y L .
(31) and the initial condition (24) jointly imply that C
e0 (Y ) = C0 (Y ). Let us denote Y̆ the intersection point
Suppose that there exists a Y > Y L such that C

Therefore for each Y , an increase in M implies an increase in C0 (Y ) and decrease in B(Y ) = Y − C0 (Y ).
In the equilibrium with co-optation, we can substitute (16) into (23):
C00 (Y ) =

f1 (C0 (Y ))

Similarly, (18) and (23) imply the equation (31) for the equilibria with censorship:
C00 (Y ) =

In this case M =

Differentiating the expressions for M with regard to parameters of the model, we obtain the comparative

Proof of Proposition 5. The equation (23) immediately implies that if both countries have the same Y
and C, then the ratio of slopes of C0 (Y ) for the two countries is as follows

where M is a constant depending on the parameters of propaganda and censorship, and the distributions of
economic shocks.
Let us first consider Y = Y L . At this level of output, the two countries have the same consumption:

C0 (Y L ) = C0 (Y L ) = Y L . Therefore (32) implies that in the vicinity of Y = Y L the slope C0 (Y ) is

below C0 (Y ). Therefore there exists a range of Y for which C0 (Y ) < C0 (Y ).

Suppose that at some Y the two curves C0 (Y ) and C0 (Y ) intersect. Let us denote as Ye the intersection

Using (32), we find that B

Let us now prove that there cannot be another intersection. Indeed, suppose that there exist other

monotonicity of B(Y ).
Therefore there can only be one intersection point Ye . To the left of this intersection point, Y ∈ (Y L , ye),
the first country has a higher consumption, C, and lower budget, B, for propaganda, censorship and cooptation than the second country. To the right of this intersection point, Y ∈ (Ye , Y H ), the second country
spends more on consumption and less on propaganda, censorship and co-optation than the first country.
