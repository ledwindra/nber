June 1987
Monopolistic Competition, Credibility and the Output Costs
of Disinflation Programs

an Analysis of Price Controls
ABSTRACT

Brazil, Argentina and Israel all used price controls as part of

disinflation programs in 1985—1986. In each case they were intended to break
an "inertial" component of inflation. This paper focuses on a specific
mechanism through which inflation inertia can emerge: the interaction between
lack of credibility of government monetary policy announcements and the price

setting behavior of forward looking firms. We show that this interaction can
lead to inertia extending well beyond the price setting period; that is

important since the price setting period is likely to be short in high
inflation economies.
We

develop an open economy macromodel in which firms set prices

before uncertainty about government monetary policy is resolved. Lack of

credibility

is then shown to lead to output losses during a disinflation

program. We demonstrate the effects of price controls and show that their
temporary use can be defended on welfare grounds. The paper analyzes asset
price behavior during disinflation programs with and without price controls

and the influence of credibility problems. We discuss nominal and real
interest rates, the stock market and exchange rates. Finally we show that if
past government policy has any information content about future government

policy, cheating on current announcements of tight policy buys current

during the price control period at the cost of higher
inflation afterwards. Sustaining low inflation after the price control

requires restrictive monetary policy during the price control period.

1. Introduction
Brazil, Argentina and Israel all used price controls as part of

highly visible disinflation programs in 1985—1986. The controls were intended
to break an "inertial" component of inflation, and hence planned as temporary

measures. Like previous experiences with price controls, the result to date
have been mixed. Israel has succeeded in lifting most of them without
triggering a resurgence of inflation; Brazil and Argentina failed in repeated

attempts to do likewise. This experience raises many questions to which the
existing literature does not provide an answer. It is clear there are
microeconomic costs, but what are the macroeconomic benefits, if any? Under
which circumstances do price controls help in bringing down inflation and when

do they just suppress it temporarily? How should they be set up? And taken
off? What is the proper supporting role of fiscal and monetary policy during
the period controls are in force?

The literature on price controls is very scant. Possen (1978)
superimposes wage—price controls on a standard model with competitive behavior

by each actor, and adaptive expectations. Blejer and Liviatan (1987) use a
similar set up, but with inflation itself adjusting only slowly ("core
inflation" moves gradually) and argue controls substitute for the need for
restrictive demand management during the transition period towards lower
inflation.

Both papers exogenously introduce some form of inertia in the
inflationary process, in line with most policy makers' rationale for the use

of such controls (cf Arida—Lara Resende (1985)). The concept of inflation
inertia and its connotation of price setting behavior naturally leads to the

question of whether one should consider non—competitive market structures in

analyzing the effects of price controls. Helpman (1986) provides evidence

SV—046/SVD/05—21—87

that

— 2 —

this should indeed be done. He analyzes the output and trade balance

response to price controls, first under the assumption of competitive markets

and then under the assumption of monopolistic market structures. He
demonstrates that the actual output response in Brazil and Israel is at
variance with the predictions of the competitive model, but seems to accord

well with what comes out of the non—competitive model. Dornbusch and Simonsen
(1986) and Simonsen (1986) also assume non—competitive markets. They explain
inflation inertia as a consequence of coordination failure between wage and

price setters in the economy after an observed change in monetary policy. The
role of wage—price controls is clear in such a world: the government through
such controls resolves the coordination failure.

This paper also focuses on the role of price inertia. Like Dornbusch
and Simonsen (1986) and Simonsen (1986), we do not assume inertia

exogenously. However we will focus on a different mechanism through which
inflation inertia emerges: the interaction between lack of credibility of
government monetary policy announcements and the price setting behavior of

forward looking firms. We show that this interaction can lead to inertia
extending well beyond the price setting period; that is important since the

price setting period is likely to be short in high inflation economies. In
Section 2, the paper develops an open economy macromodel (a variant of the one
introduced in Svensson and van Wijnbergen (1986,1987)) in which firms set

prices before uncertainty about government monetary policy is resolved. Money
demand is based on interest sensitive cash—in—advance requirements like in

Lucas (1982) and, especially, Svensson (1985, 1986). Consumers have rational
expectations and use intertemporal welfare optimization to decide on

consumption patterns, savings rate and portfolio allocation. We use the
capital asset pricing model to work out asset prices and interest rates.

SV—046/SVD/05—27—87

— 3 —

The model is used in Section 3 to show how lack of credibility can
lead to output losses during a disinflation program. We demonstrate the
effects of price controls and show that their temporary use can in fact be

defended on welfare grounds. Section 4 analyzes asset prices during the
control period, and the influence of credibility problems. We discuss nominal

and real interest rates, the stock market and exchange rates. We finally
address the question of the appropriate stance of monetary policy during the

price controls. We show that, if past government policy has any information
content about future government policy, cheating on current announcements of
tight policy buys current employment gains during the price control period at

the cost of higher inflation afterwards. Sustaining low inflation after the
price control period thus requires restrictive monetary policy during the
price control period.

Analytical Framework

2.1 The Model
There are two countries, home and foreign. Each country is
completely specialized in the production of home and foreign goods,

respectively. There is production of differentiated products, but at this
stage it is sufficient to consider two aggregate goods only. In period t (t =
—1, 0,1, ...)

world per capita production of each good, Y and

respectively, is costless up to an exogenous stochastic capacity level,

and t.

When output falls short of capacity, there is underutilization of

resources. V

1! Underutilization

of resources can be interpreted as unemployment under
some simple labor market assumptions (for example fixed coefficients in
production and a fixed labour supply).

— 4 —

SV—046/SVD/05—27—87

The (worLd per capita) supply of home and foreign currency in period
t, M and Nt, respectively, is given by

=

(2.1)

wM1

and 11* =

w*N*11.

w (w*) is the gross rate monetary expansion of home and (foreign) currency.
y, y* and at are serially independently distributed. Their

probability distributions are the time—invariant functions F(y)i Ft(y)
and 11*. There are only two possible values for w: a high expansionary value,
and a low value

w's distribution function, H, then takes the

following form:

0

H (cii)

The home and the foreign consumer have identical preferences:

(2.3)

EtZ_tBttu(cht, Cf),

0 < s 1.

Et is the expectations operator conditional upon information available in

period t; u(cht, cf) is a standard concave instantaneous utility function of

consumption ch and cf of home and foreign goods, respectively, in period t.
The home consumer enters period t with stocks of six different
assets: home and foreign currency, Mt_i and Nt_I, shares in home and foreign
firms, Zht_1 and zft_1 and claims to transfers of home and foreign currency,

xM_1 and

— 5 —

SV—046/SVD/05—27—87

In

the beginning of the period the consumer Learns current capacities

and monetary expansions. After that, the goods market opens. On the goods
market the consumer can buy home and foreign goods. He must pay for home
goods with home currency and for foreign goods with foreign currency. J

Hence he faces the liquidity constraints

Since nominal goods prices are sticky and do not adjust to the
current state of the market, there will be excess demand in some states and

excess supply in others. When there is excess demand consumers will be
rationed. Thus the home consumer also faces the rationing constraints. 2/

(2.5)

chY and

After the consumer's transactions on the goods market, that market

closes and the asset market opens. On the asset market, dividends on shares
are distributed, and the consumer can trade assets and liabilities according
to the budget constraint:

1/ In the terminology of Helpman and Razin (1984), this is the S—system,
where the sellers nationality determines the transactions currency. They
also consider the B—system, where the nationality of the buyer determines
the transactions currency.

2/ We exploit that in equilibrium either none or both consumers will be
rationed, and we assume that in the latter case they receive identical
rations.

The home consumer will maximize expected utility (2.3) subject to the

vector (y, y, w, w). w is wealth inclusive asset returns at the time
asset markets are open.

Before describing the solution, consider the pricing problem of
firms. Home (foreign) firms produce differentiated home (foreign) goods in
monopolistic competition along the lines of Dixit and Stiglitz (1977). They
set prices in their own currency, and, for some reason left unspecified, must

do so before the current values of w*, y,y* and, in the case of uncertainty

about w, w are known. Hence own—currency goods prices

ht÷l and

will

depend on period t information only. For convenience we use the inverse price

and

level, M =

ir

=

l/P.

Firms set prices such as to maximize their

stock market value; the solution to this price setting problem is given in

Appendix B. Absence of money illusion and of serial correlation in the
process generating output y implies a functional form for the resulting price
setting function:

k, k* independent of period t+l actual output (See Appendix B for the

determination of k and k*). A subscript E refers to expected value and primes
to variables in period t+l.

We consider a perfectly pooled equilibrium, where the home and
foreign consumer hold identical portfolios and consume identical quantitities

of the goods. Thus the market equilibrium conditions for the goods, money and
other asset markets are

equals the marginal utility of wealth in terms of home goods U), unless
binding liquidity constraints (uh > 0) or capacity limits (vh > 0) drive a
wedge between the two:

The marginal utility of wealth measured in home goods, A depends
only on home monetary expansion. From the asset pricing equation for claims

The multiplicative term (WE/w) drops out in the absence of expectational

Overestimating money growth increases the marginal utility of wealth. This is
because overestimating money growth leads to unanticipated tight money, and
lower prices tomorrow than

previously

anticipated. But lower

prices

tomorrow

for given prices today raise the marginal utility of a nominal unit of wealth,

AIMS since it coimnands more resources tomorrow. Since i

is

predetermined,

A goes up as a consequence.

A set of expressions similar to 2.10 holds for foreign variables.
The variables and equations can be decomposed into two groups, one
corresponding to home and one to foreign variables. Front (2.10) we can solve
for the endogenous variables

ch, A, uh and

as functions of y, w, and w,

and consumption of foreign goods cf. From the corresponding equations for

foreign variables we can solve for cf, Xf hf and Vf as functions of y*

Finally we need to address the way firms form expectations about

future monetary policy. In Svensson and van Wijnbergen (1987) current shocks
contain no information value about future shocks. Here we want to focus on

disinflation programs: after a period of high inflation and high money growth
(w =

wa),

(w =

WL) at the time firms need to make pricing decisions. We will explore

Bayesian updating formulas (see Backus and Driffil (l985a,b) for an

example). Alternatively, a signaling equilibrium might exist where a
government, by appropriately low choice of u)L can make sure that the
historicaLly inherited value of TH (applied to period t) will switch to 0 or 1
depending on the monetary policy followed during the price control period:

see Persson and van Wijnbergen (1987) for such an approach. In this paper we
are concerned more with the consequences of credibiLity problems rather than
their cause; we therefore simply adopt the Persson—van Wijnbergen (1987)

policy during the controls coincides with the announcement of tight policy

or not. Existence of such a signaling equilibrium requires that

is low

enough to make it optimal for the expansionary government not to follow it, in
spite of the credibility gains it would get by doing so; but high enough to
not make it too costly for the "tight" government to use 10L as signal
(Persson and van Wijnbergen (1987))].

2.2 Interest and Exchange Rate Determination
One over one plus the nominal interest rate equals the present value,
measured in money terms, of a sure unit of nominal money paid out next period
(after goods markets close; bonds yield no liquidity services):

(2.12a)

1/(l+i) =

BEA'w'M/(AJM)

or i =

E1iT/(EX'1r4)

— 11

SV—046/SVDIO5—27—87

—

The second equality is derived using equation (A.3d).

The nominal interest rate hence equals the ratio between expected future

liquidity services of money, Epw, and the expected utility of future nominal

wealth, EA'ic. The interpretation is straightforward: both money and a
nominal bond have an end of period value equal to one unit of money. During
the holding period, money alone yields liquidity services, valued at

Eut.

To offset that advantage, bonds need to pay interest of equal value, so market
clearing requires iEX'ir1 =

Euh1r, which yields (2.12). Similar expressions

hold for i. Note in particular that current prices

(tiN) do not influence i.

Real rates can be derived from the present value of a future unit of
wealth measured in terms of home (foreign) goods to derive the own rate of
interest for home (foreign) goods:

(2.13)

l/(l+r) =

BEX'/x;

1/(1+r*) = $EX*hIX*

Consider finally exchange rates. Most high inflation countries that
went through a disinflation programs used some form of nominal exchange rate

fixing, at least initially (Bolivia 1986 is an exception). However, those
countries also has extensive black markets in which foreign assets were traded

freely. We therefore assume a floating rate system; the emprirical
counterpart of the exchange rate is thus the black market rate.Y

!'

To completely dismiss the official rate as an inframarginal set of trade
taxes and subsidies with no real impact other than distributional is
clearly overly simplistic. An analysis of dual exchange rate systems
would however be outside the scope of this paper. Kiguel and Lizondo
(1986) provide a recent survey.

— 12 —

However, since liquidity and capacity constraints may drive a wedge
between the marginal utility of consumption and the marginal utility of
wealth, this is not necessarily the exchange rate that would obtain if markets

for domestic and foreign money would be open during the goods market.!' If
such markets would open up, it is easy to show that the following would hold

The "ex post" equilibrium can fall in either one of three regimes for
each country's commodity market,a' depending on the realization of capacity

and monetary expansions. In the first regime, the capacity constraint is

In the third regime, there is excess capacity AND excess liquidity,

In this regime, labeled U in fig. 1, there is a true effective demand failure:

neither capacity nor liquidity constraints are binding. This happens if

monetary policy is very restrictive (a low). Thus inflationary expectations
are low and the return on money commensurately high. This regime is to the SE

of W in fig. 1. Svensson (1986) shows that this regime will never obtain if
a is known

to

firms when they set prices for the next period.

3. Price Controls, Credibility and the Output Costs of Disinflation Programs
We will use the machinery developed in section 2 to analyze the
employment costs of disinflation programs, the impact of credibility problems

and the role for price controls. Consider an economy where the price level
and the money stock have been growing at a high rate

w. Then, at the end of

period t—1, the government announces a disinflation program that relies on a

reduction in the growth rate of money, down to a low rate

The impact of

credibility works through firms' price setting behavior. The government
either follows its announcement, so

is actually realized, or it reneges on

— 15 —

its announcement. For simplicity we assume that in that case the pre—

is implemented. The firms' assess-

announcement high money growth rate

ment of the probability that this happens is H Expected money growth is

WE = TH WH + (li) WL

The impact of credibility can then be assessed by comparing the case of

a 0 with what happens when

Consider the case of

is believed; assume the government aLso follows through. Hence WE a
This is equivalent to case where firms actually know monetary policy before
setting prices; hence, as shown in section 2 no real variables will be

affected by the slowdown in money growth. Firms will offset the drop in w by
an increase in K (fall in future prices). In terms of the diagram, the
liquidity constraint line rotates down (figure 2).

The basic problem is

government not following its announcements,

straightforward: lack of credibility causes the real money stock to be "too
low" on the transition path between the policy announcement and the period at

which government credibility is established. It is the interaction between
monopolistic price setting and credibility that causes the output losses
during disinflation programs.

An important point to note is that the time period during which this
problem will persist is NOT the period during which prices are fixed, but the
time it takes for

to fall to zero. This may be a substantially longer; in

high inflation countries prices will often be adjusted at high frequency, but
if information about government fiscal and monetary policy becomes available
only gradually, WE may exceed WL and unemployment may remain high for a period
of time well in excess of the price setting period.

Fig. 3 can also be used to show what price controls can do to

alleviate this problem. Before we do so one prior point. In models like the
one presented here controls can also be used to permanently improve on the
full anticipation equilibrium, because the monopolistic competition market
structure results in socially suboptimal output levels in some states of

nature. A proper analysis of such a policy would however also need to take
into account the microeconomic costs such a policy would entail. The symmetry
assumptions made in this paper prevent a satisfactory analysis of 9uch costs
which are related to the relative price distortions controls unavoidably

introduce. We therefore do not consider their possible permanent use here but
impose that they are used for transitional purposes only.

sets K, say at Kc. If Kc is set below the no—controls solution
will never bind; if

controls

the LL line rotates down and expected

is set above

output increases because of the controls whenever they are binding. It is
clearly possible to set prices such that the full credibility solution is

reproduced: this involves setting K equal to KL, rotating the liquidity
constraint line as indicated in fig. 4. Transitional umemployment losses are
avoided when binding price controls are imposed in that manner, basically
because price controls allow a higher real money stock during the transition
period towards full credibility.

Welfare will clearly improve (see Appendix A.2 for proof):
uC(ch, c1) > U Price controls therefore increase welfare if credibility
problems cause transitional unemployment without such controls.
The argument for government intervention in the case of mistaken

beliefs has also been made by Calvo (1986). The nature of the welfare Losses
in his example is different, however. There consumers underestimate the true
intertemporal terms of trade because they mistakenly expect a trade reform to

be reversed. Hence too much expenditure is shifted towards today, and a wedge
opens up between the intertemporal terms of trade and the intertemporal rate

of substitution in consumption. The associated welfare costs are proportional
to the intertemporal substitution elasticity, in standard "Harberger triangle"

fashion. Mistaken beliefs do not lead to underutilization of resources
however, contrary to the example provided here. Finally, the result that
under monopolistic competition price controls incrase output also emerges in
the analysis of Helpman (1987), although not through the same mechanism.
Credibility plays no role in his paper.

Cheating on announcements by announcing WL but implementing

leads to employment gains in period t; after all, prices were set based on the

expectation WE C w. However, since the same incentive problem arises next
period, firms will subsequently increase

above

and set next period's

prices accordingly. In that sense price controls lead to an intertemporaL
trade off between current unemployment and future inflation.
The informational asyruunetry arises because firms need to set prices

after monetary policy is announced, but before its realization can be

observed. This could lead to uncertainty about actual policy if firms have
incomplete information about the government's preferences. For example firms
could be uninformed about the government's rate of time

current employment gains by cheating on its monetary policy announcements for
the price control period (?ersson and van Wijnbergen (1987)).
In such circumstances it is possible that

a

signaling equilibrium

would switch to zero or one

depending on whether w in the price controls period coincides with the
announced value

or not. This is explored further in Persson and

van Wijnbergen (1987), and simply assumed here.

4.1 Interest Rates, Exchange Rates and the Stock Market During Disinflation
To determine the behaviour of asset prices during disinflation

controls consider first the marginal utility of wealth, A. Since both
expected monetary expansion and expectational errors influence A, we need to
distinguish the case where the government implements its announcement (w —
WL)

and the case where it cheats: w =
respectively.

This has implications for both real interest rates and stock market

The intuition is straightforward: a high current marginal utility of wealth
lovers the relative value of future claims on output with respect to current

wealth and hence depresses the stock market. The reverse happens after an
unanticipated monetary expansion, as when the government cheats on its

announcement and implements w instead.
A more conventional presentation draws on real interest behaviour.

Real rates equal the expected rate of decline in A (cf Section 2.2); Table
4.2 follows from (2.14) and Table 4.1.:

This is an important result: during a disinflation program, real

interest rates will be high if the disinflation program is in fact
implemented, and low if the government cheats and plays

Note that

— 24

this

is a more fundamental result than the often—heard claim that credibility

problems only raise ex—post but not ex—ante real rates, since inflationary

expectations exceed inflation. r is the return on an indexed bond, so
inflation surprises do not affect it. Cheating by implementing a more
expansionary policy than announced will thus lower the real interest rate and
shift consumption forward into the current period.

Consider next the nominal interest rate. This is non—trivial since
simple relations between real and nominal rates and inflation break down in

the presence of monetary policy uncertainty (Svensson (1985)). Applying the
asset pricing equ. 2.13a and Table 4.1 yields Table 4.3:

Table 4.3 shows that, contrary to real interest rates, nominal rates of
interest are not affected by credibility problems during the period of

controls. This is because current surprises in the level of the moneystock
affect the future price level, but this influences the future liquidity
service of money in the same way it affects the marginal utility of wealth.

Hence the relative attractiveness of money and bonds is not affected by such
surprises and hence neither is the nominal interest rate.

For similar reasons, the asset market exchange rate is not affected

by credibility problems either. The exchange rate results are straight

forward: expansionary policy leads to a depreciating rate, and tight policy
to an appreciating rate:

The results are intuitive: if monetary policy does not deviate from its
announced values, with which the controls are compatible (u =

wL) the

marginal utility of wealth equals what would obtain under a fully credible
implementation of

Since price controls remedy the problem of a too low

real money stock on the transition path towards credibility, they also prevent
the high real interest rates that we showed characterize the no—controls

disinflation programs (see section 4.1 and tabLes 4.2 and 4.4). Hence an
important result: a disinflation program, combined with price controls set to
be compatible with the announced tight money policy, will work if the

restrictive policy is indeed followed. It will work in the sense that
mistaken beliefs will now not cause intertemporal distortions and the
associated high real interest rates and transitional output losses that
restrictive policies alone would cause in the presence of credibility
problems.

Cheating on the announcement (i.e. announcing

WL and setting the

price controls accordingly, but implementing WH) would cause deviations from
the full credibility results. Table 4.4 shows that the resulting increase in
the real money stock during the transition period lowers X during that
period. Cheating will thus also cause a temporary fall in the real interest
rate (cf. table 4.4) and art increase in expected output. However, because of
the signaling function of actual monetary policy,

y will

now switch to one

and inflation in the post—control period becomes therefore unavoidable.
Cheating on the announcement—cum—controls package therefore indeed buys
current employment gains at the cost of future inflation losses.

The results are very different for nominal interest rates. As we saw
in section 4.1, current prices do not influence nominal interest rates (equ.
4.lb); the nominal interest rate equals the ratio between expected future

liquidity

services and the expected utility of future nominal weaLth. Using

2.12 and 2.13b it becomes obvious that the results from table 4.3 apply

independent of the imposition of price controls. Price controls will affect
real interest rates, not nominal rates.

Consider finally exchange rates. Clearly price controls applying to
the goods market in period t will not affect the exchange rate obtaining while

the asset market operates afterwards. Thus, the results from the previous
section apply: expansionary policy during the control period set

to one

(lead to expectations of future expansion) and hence the exchange rate will
fall (depreciate):

where the subscript NC refers to the no control case and C to the case of

the control period (WH) will depreciate the exchange rate one for one.
Since these rates are free market rates, their empirical counterpart

is probably the black market exchange rate. Expansionary policy during the
control period could therefore lead to a rising black market premium, while
controls with tight policy should lead to a fall in that premium.

Conclusions

The notion of price inertia naturally leads to an imperfect

competition framework. In this paper, we focus on the interaction between
lack of credibility of government policy announcements and the price setting

behavior of forward looking firms in monopolistic competition. We show that
this interaction can lead to inflation inertia extending well beyond the price

setting period. The latter is important, because the price setting period is
likely to be short in highly inflationary economies.

We do this within the framework of an open economy macro model in
which firms have to set prices before uncertainty about government policy is

resolved. This model is used to analyze the precise nature of output losses
during a monetary stabilization program, and the potential role for price

controls in avoiding them. We show that with full credibility, the monetary
disinflation will not cause output losses, in spite of price setting by
firms. If firms, assign a positive probability to the government not

implementing its announcements, however, output losses will arise. The basic
problem is straightforward: lack of credibility causes the real money stock to
be "too low" on the transition path between the policy announcement and the

period in which government credibility will finally be established. It is the
interaction between monopolistic price setting and credibility that causes the
output losses during disinflation programs.

If the government does not renege on its announcements, money will be

lower than anticipated, and hence the real money stock too tight. The ensuing
tightening of liquidity constraints lowers consumption and raises the marginal

utility of wealth. This effect dies away as credibility improves and the gap

SV—046/SvD/O5—21—87

— 31 —

between actual and anticipated money disappears (in this paper the information
structure is set up such that that only takes one period). The temporary
impact on the marginal utility of wealth also explains the behavior of asset

prices during the transition period. The stock market valuation of home firms
measures the value of claims on future output plus future resale value in
terms of current marginal utility of wealth; hence the result that stock
markets will be depressed during a disinflation program that is incompletely

believed but actually implemented. Similarly, real interest rates will be
high during a disinflation program plagued by credibility problems but

actually implemented. The real interest rate on an indexed bond equals the
rate at which the marginal utility of a real unit of wealth, A, declines over

time; thus a declining A impLies a high real rate of interest. This is a
more fundamental result than the often heard claim that credibility problems
raise the ex—post real rate but not the ex—ante one, because inflationary

expectations are higher than actual inflation. But we have derived the result
for an indexed bond, which is not affected by such inflation surprises.

We finally discuss nominal interest rates and the exchange rate.
Nominal interest rates are not affected by surprises in the level of the money

stock: the nominal interest rate equals the ratio between the value of future
liquidity services of money and the marginal utility of a future unit of
nominal wealth, and a money stock level surprise affects both the in the same

way. Thus there is no impact of credibility problems on nominal rates. They
will be high when actual monetary policy is expansionary and low when it is
not, irrespective of credibility problems.
For a similar reason, there will be no impact of credibility problems
per se on asset markets exchange rates (i.e. the relative price of a unit of

SV—046/SVIJ/05—27—87

foreign

— 32

—

and domestic currency traded when asset markets are open).

Expansionary policy will depreciate the exchange rare, and contractionary

policy appreciate it, irrespective of credibility problems. This is not the
case with the commodity market exchange rate however. The latter is the rate
that would obtain during the time commodity markets are open if there were
continuous trading in home and foreign currency. We show that for that
exchange rate concept, the rate will appreciate because of credibility
problems for those output realizations where liquidity constraints become
binding.

All these intratemporal and intertemporal relative price effects
carry true economic welfare losses; they cause wedges between rates of
substitution and terms of trade available in commodity and asset markets.
Price controls avoid these problems by taking the pricing decisions out of the

firms' hands. Thus anticipations of reneging on tight money announcements
will not be passed on in prices that will then be too high if the government

in fact does not renege. As a consequence there will be no output losses
during a disinflation program with properly administered price controls, and
no increase in the marginal utility of wealth,

credibility problems

notwitstanding. Hence high real interest rates will be avoided.
However, we also show the importance of restrictive policies

during

the price control period. If price controls are compatible with the announced
monetary disinflation program, and actual monetary policy does not deviate
from its announced values, the relative price distortions mentioned are
avoided, but exploiting price controls to relax monetary policy beyond its
announced values reintroduces them.

Moreoever, we show that if current actual

monetary policy has any information content about future monetary policy,

SV—046/SV0f05—27—87

— 33 —

expansionary monetary policy during the price controL period Leads to the same
anticipatory price setting problems after the control period that these

controls were designed to resolve. In that sense, credibility and price
controls together introduce an intertemporal trade off between current

employment gains and future inflationary costs. Sustaining low inflation
beyond the period of price controls thus requires restrictive monetary policy
during the price control period.

APPENDIX B: The Price Setting Problem

We consider a continuum of firms defined over the unit interval, each

producing a unique differentiated good indexed by j, 0 S

j

1. Home

preferences for differentiated goods are described by a CES subutility

function separable in the home and foreign aggregates with corresponding CES
prices indices,

and

It follows that per capita demand for home

product j is:

Actual output is the minimum of capacity and demand:

The home currency stock market value of firm h is:

the asset pricing equation (A.3e) from Appendix A. This can be

simplified using (2.lld):

Consider first the case where the firm actually knows that a will

equal say w. Then (2.20) can be written as:

The expression between parentheses equals Ey'. Equation (2.21) immediately

shows one important result: if w' is known in advance, expected output

depends on Kw', but not on w'. Maximizing the stock market valuation

Simple manipulation of (2.22) shows that firms set the price such that the

elasticity of demand equaLs minus one. The price influences that elasticity
because it determines the probability of excess capacity. Without excess
capacity, the elasticity is zero; with excess capacity it equals

the

first order condition, once syuinetry across firms has been imposed, implies a

choice of h• such that the output weighted expected value of the demand
elasticity equals one:

Consider next the case of policy uncertainty. We take a simple case,
in anticipation of the analysis of disinflation programs in the next

section: monetary expansion can be either high or low and the firm attaches

probability y to the possibility of an expansionary monetary policy:
