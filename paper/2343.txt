Mean Reversion in Stock Prices: Evidence and Implications

ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes the statistical evidence bearing on whether transitory
components account for a large fraction of the variance in common stock returns.
The first part treats methodological issues involved in testing for transitory

return components. It demonstrates that variance ratios are among the most
powerful tests for detecting mean reversion in stock prices, but that they have
little power against the principal interesting alternatives to the random walk

hypothesis. The second part applies variance ratio tests to market returns for
the United States over the 1871-1986 period and for seventeen other countries over
the 1957-1985 period, as well as to returns on individual firms over the 1926-

1985 period. We find consistent evidence that stock returns are positively
serially correlated over short horizons, and negatively autocorrelated over long

horizons. The point estimates suggest that the transitory components in stock
prices have a standard deviation of between 15 and 25 percent and account for

more than half of the variance in monthly returns. The last part of the paper
discusses two possible explanations for mean reversion: time varying required
returns, and slowly—decaying "price fads" that cause stock prices to deviate

from fundamental values for periods of several years. We conclude that
explaining observed transitory components in stock prices on the basis of movements in required returns due to risk factors is likely to be difficult.

This paper examines the evidence on the extent to which stock prices

exhibit mean—reverting behavior. The question of whether stock prices contain
transitory components is important for financial practice and theory. For

example, consider the question of investment strategy. If stock price movements
contain large transitory components then for long—horizon investors the stock
market may be much less risky than it appears when the variance of single-period

returns is extrapolated using the random walk model. Market folklore has long
suggested that those who "take the long view" should invest more in equity than

those with a short horizon. Although harshly rejected by most economists, this

view is correct if prices exhibit mean-reverting behavior.1 Furthermore, the
presence of transitory price components suggests the desirability of investment
strategies involving the purchase of securities that have recently declined in
value.

Important transitory components in stock prices could also impart some
logic to economic agents' reluctance to tie decisions to current market values.
Corporate managers often assert that their common stock is misvalued and claim
that it would be unwise to base investment decisions on its current market

price. A common procedure among universities and other institutions that rely
on endowment income is to spend on the basis of a weighted average of past

endowment values. Harvard University spends out of endowment according to a
preset trend line regardless of the market's value. Such rules are hard to
understand if stock prices follow a random walk, but make sense if prices contain important transitory components.

As a matter of theory, evaluating the extent of mean-reversion in stock
prices is crucial for assessing claims such as Keynes' (1936) assertion that

—2—

"all sorts of considerations enter into market valuation which are in no way

relevant to the prospective yield (p.152)." If divergences between market and
fundamental values exist, but beyond some limit are eliminated by speculative

forces, then stock prices will exhibit mean reversion. Returns must be negatively serially correlated at some frequency if "erroneous" market moves are even-

tually corrected.2 As Merton (1987) notes, reasoning of this type has been used
to draw conclusions about market valuations from failures to reject the absence

of negative serial correlation in returns, Conversely, the presence of negative
autocorrelation may signal departures from fundamental values, though it could
also arise from risk factors that vary through time.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 begins by evaluating alternative statistical procedures for testing for transitory components in stock

prices. We find that variance ratio tests of the type used by Fama and French
(1986a) and Lo and MacKinlay (1987) come close to being the most powerful tests

of the null hypothesis of market efficiency cum constant required returns
against plausible alternative hypotheses such as the "fads" model suggested by

Shiller (1984) and Summers (1986). Nevertheless, these tests have little power,
even with data spanning a sixty year period. They have less than a one -in four
chance of rejecting the random walk model in favor of alternative hypotheses

that attribute most of the variance in stock returns to transitory factors. We
conclude that a sensible balancing of Type I and Type II errors suggests use of
critical values above the conventional .05 level.
Section 2 examines the evidence on the presence of mean reversion in stock

prices. For the United States, we analyze monthly data on real and excess New
York Stock Exchange returns since 1926, as well as annual returns data for the

—3—

1871—1986 period. We also analyze evidence from seventeen other equity markets
around the world, and study the mean-reverting behavior of individual corporate

securities in the United States. The results are fairly consistent in suggesting the presence of transitory components in stock prices, with returns exhibiting positive autocorrelatjon over short periods but negative autocorrelation
over longer periods.

Section 3 uses our variance ratio estimates to gauge the substantive signi-

ficance of transitory components in stock prices. For the United States we find
that the standard deviation of the transitory price component varies between 15
and 25 percent of value, depending on what assumption we make about its per-

sistence. The point estimates imply that transitory components account for more
than half of the variance in monthly returns, a finding that is confirmed by the
evidence from other countries.

Section 4 addresses the question of whether observed patterns of mean
reversion and the associated movements in ex ante returns are better explained

by fundamentals such as changes in interest rates or market volatility, or as

byproducts of noise trading. We review several types of evidence indicating the
difficulty of accounting for observed transitory components on the basis of
changes in real interest rates or risk prelnia. Noise trading appears to be a
plausible alternative explanation for transitory price components.

Section 5 concludes by discussing some implications of our results and
directions for future research.

1. Methodological Issues Involved in Testing for Transitory Components

A vast literature dating at least back to Kendall (1933) has tested the
efficient markets/constant required returns model by examining individual auto-

correlations in security returns. This literature, surveyed in Fama (1970),
generally found little evidence of patterns in security returns and is frequent-

ly adduced in support of the efficient markets hypothesis. Recent work by
Shiller and Perron (1985) and Summers (1986) has shown that such tests have
relatively little power against interesting alternatives to the null hypothesis
of market efficiency with constant required returns.
Several recent studies using new tests for serial dependence, notably Fama
F
and rench
(].986a), have nonetheless rejected the random walk model. This sec-

tion begins by descr ibing several possible tests for the presence of stationary
stock price componen ts, including those used in recent studies. We then present
Monte Carlo evidence on the power of each test against plausible alternatives to
the null hyothesis of serially independent returns. We find that even the best
possible tests have 1 'ittle power against plausible alternatives to the random

walk model when we specify the (conventional) size of .05. We conclude with a
discussion of general issues i nvolved in test design when the data can oni y
weakly differentiate alternatiye hypotheses, addressing in particular the degree

of presumption that should be accorded to our null hypothesis of serially independent returns.

1.1. Test Methods

Recent studies employ different but related tests f or mean reversion. Fama
and French (1986a) and Lo and MacKinlay (1987) compare the relative variability

—5—

of returns over different horizons usi ng variance ratio tests.

Fama and French

(1987) use regression tests which also involve studying the ser lal correlation
in many-period returns.

Campbell and Mankiw (1987), studying transitory corn-

ponents in real output, use parametric ARMA models to gauge the importance of

mean reversion. As we shall see, each of these approaches involves using a particular function of the sample autocorrelations to test the hypothesis that all
autocorrelations equal zero.

The variance ratio test exploits the fact that if the logarithm of the
stock price, including cumulated dividends, follows a random walk then the
return variance should be proportional to the return horizon.3 We study the

variability of returns at different horizons, relative to the variation over a

one-year period. When we analyze monthly returns, the variance ratio statistic
is therefore:

(1)

where

VR(k) =

[Var(R)/k]/[Var(R2)/12)

k-i
k
Rt., Rt denoting the total return in month t.4 This statistic
Rt =
1=0

converges to unity if returns are uncorrelated through time. If some of the
price variation is due to transitory factors, this will generate negative autocorrelations at some lags and yield a variance ratio below one.
The variance ratio is closely related to earlier tests based on estimated

autocorrelations. Cochrane (1986) shows that the ratio of the k—month return
variance to k times the one-month return variance is approximately equal to a

linear combination of sample autocorrelations. Using his results, it is

straightforward

to show that (1) can be approximated by:

VR(k)

•(k-12) +
j=1

k-i
j=12

The variance ratio statistic places increasing positive weight on autocorrelations up to and including lag 11, with declining positive weight thereafter.

The small sample distribution of the variance ratio can be inferred from

its relationship to the sample autocorrelations. Kendall and Stuart (1976) show
that under the null hypothesis of serial independence, the jth sample autocorrelation has (i) an expected value of -1/(T-j), where I denotes sample size, (ii)
an asymptotic variance of l/T, and (iii) zero covariance with estimated auto-

correlations at other lags. The expected value of VR(k) is therefore:

The variance ratio statistics reported below are bias—corrected by dividing the
measured variance ratio by E(VR(k)).5

A second test for mean reversion, used by Fama and French (1987), involves

regressing multi-period returns on lagged values of multiperiod returns. This
test is also designed to exploit information on the high-order autocorrelations

in returns. The test is based on whether

(4)

is significantly different from zero, where

return. The probability limit of this statistic may be approximated as a linear
combination of autocorrelations:

k applies negative weight to autocorrelations up to order 2k/3, followed by
increasing positive weight up to lag k, followed by decaying positive weights.

The difficulties that affect the variance ratio also induce small sample bias in
Fama and French (1987) use Monte Carlo simulations to correct this problem.

A third method of detecting mean reversion involves computing a likelihood
ratio test of the null hypothesis of serial independence against a particular

alternative. A wide range of likelihood ratio tests could be developed for different alternative hypotheses. We present results for two such tests below.

1.2 Power Calculations
To analyze the power of alternative tests for mean reversion, we consider
the class of alternative hypotheses to the random walk model that Summers (1986)
suggests, where the logarithm of stock prices

embodies both a permanent

and a transitory (ut) component. The transitory component might be due to

variation in required returns, or to some type of pricing fads. We assume that
(6)

follows

an ARMA(1,1) process since
(9)

(1—piL)Ap = (l—piL)ct+ (1—L)P.

This description of returns allows us to capture in a simple way the possibility
that stock prices contain transitory, but persistent, components.6 The parameter

p1 determines the persistence of the transitory component, while its importance
in return movements is determined by the relative magnitudes of

and

We perform Monte Carlo experiments by generating 25,000 sequences of 720
returns; the length of each series corresponds to the number of monthly obser-

vations in the Center for Research in Security Prices' data base. Each return
sequence is generated by drawing 720 pairs of standard normal variates. We
set

=

1, so that the variance of returns (Apr) equals 1 +

2/(1+p1).

The

share of the return variance accounted for by the stationary component is:

We parameterize the return generating process by choosing p1 and 6; these

choices determine o. We consider cases where 8 equals .25 and .75. We set
p1 =

.98 for both cases, implying that innovations in the transitory price com-

ponent have a half-life of 2.9 years.

In evaluating power, we use the empirical distribution of the test statistic generated with 8 = 0 (no transitory component) to determine the critical

region for a one-sided .05 test of the random walk null against the alternative

—9—

hypothesis of mean—reversion. The panels of Table 1 report the probability that
each test rejects the null hypothesis when the data are generated by the process
indicated at the column head.

The mean value of the test statistic under the

alternative hypothesis is also reported.
The first row in Table 1 analyzes a size .05 test based on the first—order
autocorrelation coefficient.

This test has minimal power against the alter-

native hypotheses we consider: .059 when one quarter of the variation in returns
is from the stationary factor, and .076 when three quarters of return movements

are due to transitory pricing factors. These results confirm the findings of
Shiller and Perron (1985) and Summers (1986).
The next panel in Table 1 considers variance ratio tests with values of k
ranging from 24 to 96 months.

The results suggest that the variance ratio tests

are much more powerful than tests based on the first-order autocorrelation coefficient, but still have relatively little power to detect mean reversion for

models with fairly persistent transitory components. When one quarter of the
variation in returns is due to transitory factors, the power of the variance

ratio tests range between .06 and .075. Even when three quarters of the
variance in returns is due to the stationary component, the power of the test

never rises above .190. The variance ratio tests over long horizons have
somewhat more power than the tests over short horizons. It appears however that
the power gains from lengthening the horizon are largely exhausted after 48

months. It will be useful in considering the empirical results below to recall
that in the price fads framework, even when the transitory component in prices
has a half—life of less than three years and accounts for three—quarters of the
variation in returns, the variance ratio at 96 months is .67.

The second panel in Table 1 shows power calculations for the long—horizon
regression tests. The results are similar to those for variance rati Os.

Regression tests appear to be less powerful than variance ratios agai nst our
alternative hypotheses, however, s ince the maximum power as the length of the
regression horizon varies is below the maximum power for the variance ratio

test. For example, the best variance ratb test against the 6 = .25 case has a
power of .075, while the best regression test's power is .071. Simil any, in
the 6 = .75 case, the best variance ratio test has a power of .187; the best

regression test has a power of .159. It I s interesting to note that the power
of the regression tests is maximized with windows of about forty—eig ht months
The final panel of Table 1. presents results on likelihood ratio tests.7

When the data are generated by an ARMA(1,1) model, the Neyman-Pearson lemma dictates that the likelihood ratio test is the most powerful test of the null of
serial independence against this particular alternative. The power values associated with these tests are therefore upper bounds on the possible power that
any other tests could achieve for a given s ize. In practice, even likelihood
ratio tests will have lower power since we are unlikely to construct the test
for the precise alternative hypothesis that generated the data.
Al though the likelihood ratio tests have somewhat more power than the

variance

ratio

tests, .078 in the 6 =

.25 case and .240 in the 6 =

.75 case, the

absolute power levels are still low. This provides perhaps the most telling
demonstration of the difficulty of distinguishing the random walk model of stock
prices from alternatives that imply highly persistent, yet transitory, price

components. Even the best possible tests have very low power.

—11—

1.3 EvaluatinQ Statistical Significance
The preceding discussion highlights the low power of available tests for

the presence of transitory components in stock prices. One dramatic way of
making this point is to note that using the conventional 5 significance level
in choosing between the random walk hypothesis and our two alternatives involves

in the best case a 76 probability of Type II error. For most tests, the Type
II error rate would be between .85 and .95.

Learner (1978) echoes a point made

in most statistics courses, but rarely heeded in practice, when he writes that
"the [popular] rule of thumb, setting the significance level arbitrarily at .05,
is ...

deficient

in the sense that from every reasonable viewpoint the signifi-

cance level should be a decreasing function of sample size (p.92)."

How should a significance level be set? This is obviously a matter of
judgment. Figure 1 depicts the attainable tradeoff between Type I and Type II
errors for the most powerful variance ratio and regression tests, as well as for
the likelihood ratio test against the alternative hypothesis that the data are

generated by an ARMA(1,1) process with three quarters of the monthly return

variation due to transitory price components. As our previous discussion
suggests, the power curve for the variance ratio test lies everywhere between

the frontiers attainable using regression and likelihood ratio tests. For the
variance ratio test, a .40 significance level is appropriate if the goal is to

minimize the sum of Type I and Type II errors. In order to justify using the
conventional .05 test, one would have to assign three times as great a cost to
Type I as to Type II errors.

Unless one is strongly attached to the random walk hypothesis, significance
levels in excess of .05 seem appropriate in evaluating the importance of tran-

sitory components in

prices. We see little basis f or strong attachment to

the null hypothesis. Many plausible alternative models of asset pricing,
involving rational and irrational behavior, suggest the presence of transitory

components. Furthermore, since the same problems of statistical power which
plague our search for transitory components also complicate the lives of speculators, it may be difficult for speculative behavior to eliminate these tran-

sitory components. The only real solution to the problem of "low power" is the
collection of more data. In the next section, we try to bring to bear as much
data as possible in evaluating the importance of transitory stock price components.

Statistical Evidence on Mean Reversion

This section uses variance ratio tests to analyze the importance of sta-

tionary components in stock prices. We focus primarily on excess and real

returns rather than nominal returns. Fama and French (1986a) and Lo and
MacKinlay (1987) work with nominal returns, so they are implicitly testing the

hypothesis that nominal ex-ante returns are constant.8 It seems more natural to
postulate that the required risk premium is constant, or that the required real
return is constant.

We analyze four major data sets. The first consists of monthly returns on
the New York Stock Exchange for the period since 1926. These data have been
used in other studies of mean reversion and are presented in part to demonstrate

our comparability with previous work. Our second data set includes annual
returns on the Standard and Poor's stock price indices for the period since

1871. Although these data are less reliable than the monthly CRSP data, they
are available for a much longer period. Third, we analyze post-war monthly
stock returns for seventeen stock markets outside the United States. Finally,
we consider data on individual firms in the United States for the post-1926
period to explore both mean reversion in individual share prices, and to study
whether share prices tend to revert to a market average.

2.1 Monthly NYSE Returns, 1926-1985
We begin by analyzing monthly returns on both the value-weighted and equalweighted NYSE indices from the Center for Research in Security Prices data base

for the 1926—1985 period. We consider nominal returns on these indices, excess
returns with the risk-free rate measured as the Treasury bill yield, as well as
real returns measured using the CPI inflation rate.

-14-

The variance ratio statistics for these series are shown in Table 2. We
confirm Fama and French's (1986a) finding that returns at long horizons exhibit
negative serial correlation, as reflected in values of the variance ratio far

below unity. The same findings obtain for both real and excess returns.
Typically, the results indicate that the variance of eight year returns is about
four rather than eight times the variance of one year returns. The point esti—
mates thus suggest more mean reversion in stock prices than the examples of the
previous section where transitory components accounted for three quarters of the
variance in returns.

Despite the low power of our tests, the null hypothesis of

serial independence is rejected at the .08 level for value-weighted excess
returns, and the .005 level for equal-weighted excess returns.9 Mean reversion

is more pronounced for the equal-weighted than for the value-weighted index, but
the variance ratios at long horizons are well below unity for both indices.

The variance ratios also suggest that at horizons shorter than one year,
there is some positive autocorrelation in returns. The variance of the one
month return on the equal weighted index is only .79 times as large as it would
be predicted to be given the variability of twelve—month returns. A similar
conclusion applies to the value-weighted index. This finding of first positive
then negative serial correlation accounts for Lo and MacKinlay's (1987a) result
that variance ratios exceed unity in their weekly data, while variance ratios
fall below one in other studies concerned with longer horizons.10
An issue that arises in analzying results for the CRSP sample is the sensitivity of the findings to inclusion or exclusion of the Depression years. A
number of previous studies, such as Officer (1973), have documented the unusual
behavior of stock prices during the early 1930s, and one could make a serious

argument f or excluding these years from analyses designed to shed light on

current conditions. The counter—argument, suggesting this period should be
included, is that the 1930s by virtue of the large movements in prices contain a

great deal of information about the persistence of price shocks. We explored
the robustness of our findings by truncating the sample period at both the

beginning and the end. Excluding the first ten years of the sample slightly
weakens the evidence for mean-reversion at long horizons. The negative serial
correlation in nominal returns is virtually unaffected by this sample change,
and the results for both equal-weighted real and excess returns are also quite

robust. The long-horizon variance ratios for real and excess returns on the
value-weighted index rise substantially, however. The 96-month variance ratios
are .94 and 1.07 for these two return series, compared with .71 and .54 for the

real and excess returns on the equal-weighted index. Truncating the sample to
exclude the last ten years of data has an opposite effect on the estimated
variance ratios; the evidence for mean reversion is even more pronounced than

for the full sample period. The postwar period, another subsample we analyzed,
displays less mean reversion than the full sample or the post-1936 period.

2.2 Historical Data for the United States
The CRSP data are the best available for analyzing recent U.S. experience,
but the low power of the available statistical tests suggests the value of exa-

mining other data as well. This also reduces the data-mining risks stressed by
Merton (1987). We therefore consider returns based on the combined Standard and
Poors/Cowles Commission stock price indices that are available beginning in
1871. These data have recently been checked and corrected for errors by Jones

-16-

and Wilson (1986); we use the series they report for the pre—1926 period. We
analyze annual return series for the period 1871-1925, as well as the longer

1871-1985 period. The S&P data have the advantage of being used relatively
infrequently in studies of the serial correlation properties of stock returns).1
We again consider nominal, excess, and real returns.

The results are presented in Table 3. For the pre—1925 period, the nominal
and excess returns display pronounced negative serial correlation at long hori-

zons. For the real returns, however, this pattern is much weaker. Although the
explanation of this phenomenon is unclear, it appears to result from the jagged

character of the Consumer Price Index series in the years before 1900. The ex
post inflation rate may prove a particularly unreliable measure of expected

inflation during this period. The three lower rows in Table 3 present results
for the full 1871—1985 sample period. All three return series show negative
serial correlation at long lags, but real and excess returns provide less evidence of mean-reversion than the monthly post-1925 CRSP data.

2.3 Equity Markets Outside the United States
Additional evidence on mean reversion can be obtained by analyzing the

behavior of equity markets outside the United States. We analyze returns in
Canada for the period since 1919, in Britain since 1939, and in fifteen other

nations for shorter post-war periods. The Canadian data set consists of monthly
capital gains on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The British data are monthly
returns, inclusive of dividends, on the Financial Times-Actuaries Share Price
Index.

Results for these two equity markets are shown in the first two rows of

Table 4. Both markets display substantively important mean reversion at long

horizons. In the Canadian data, the 96 month variance ratio is .585, while for

the London data it is .794. The pattern of variance ratios shows slow decay in
the Canadian case, while for the British market the variance ratio falls to .74
at the four year horizon and does not rise significantly at longer horizons.
The Canadian data show statistically significant positive serial correlation at

lags of less than twelve months. The one month variance is only .718 times the

value that would be predicted based on the twelve month variance. For the
British data, the one month variance is .832 times the twelve-month variance,
suggesting somewhat less positive serial correlation at short horizons.
Table 4 also reports results for fifteen other stock markets outside the

United States. The variance ratios are calculated from monthly returns that are
based on stock price indices in the International Monetary Funds International

Financial Statistics publication. Unfortunately, the IFS does not provide dividend yields, so the reported returns correspond to capital gains alone. To
assess the importance of this omission, we re—estimated the variance ratios for
dividend—exclusive CRSP monthly data, and dividend-exclusive British stock

market data. The results of these variance ratio calculations, presented in
Appendix Table Al, show only minor differences as a result of dividend omission.
Yield—inclusive data would surely be superior to the monthly returns we use, but
we suspect that our results would be affected in only minor ways.12
Although the variance ratios for individual countries, based typically on
data starting in 1957, have larger standard errors than the results for the

U.S., Britain, or Canada, they are remarkably similar. Most of the countries
display negative serial correlation at long horizons. In Germany, for example,

the 96—month variance ratio is .462; in France it is .438. only three of the

fifteen countries have variance ratios at 96 months that exceed unity, and many

are substantially below. Evidence of positive serial correlation at short horizons is also pervasive. In only one country, Colombia, is the variance ratio at
one month greater than unity. The short data samples make it extremely difficult to reject the null hypothesis of serial independence for any individual

country. Nonetheless, the similarity of the results for the majority of nations
supports our earlier conclusion of potentially important transitory price components.

The average variance ratios at each horizon are shown in the last two rows

of the table. The mean 96-month variance ratio is .754 when all countries are
aggregated, and .653 when we exclude Spain (which is clearly an outlier, probably because of the unusual pattern of hyperinflation followed by deflation

that it experienced during our sample). By averaging across many countries, we
also obtain a more precise estimate of the long-horizon variance ratios. The
standard error of the Spain—exclusive average for the 96—month variance ratio is
.142 assuming that the variance ratios for different countries are independent.
If we assume that these statistics have a correlation of .25, however, the standard error rises to .326, again implying that the null hypothesis of serial

independence would not be rejected at standard levels.13 The qualitative results
on positive autocorrelation at short horizons and negative autocorrelation at
long lags are, however, supportive of our qualitative findings using CRSP data.

2.4. Individual Firm Data
we also consider evidence on mean reversion for individual firms. It is
much less plausible on a priori grounds to expect transitory components in the

—19—

relative prices of individual stocks than in the market as a whole. Arbitrageurs should find the task of trading in individual securities to correct mispricing far easier than taking positions in the entire market to offset persist-

ent misvaluations. In spite of this, some previous work has suggested that
individual stock returns may exhibit negative serial correlation. Miller and
Scholes (1982), for example, show that regressing ex post returns on the
reciprocal of the stock price yields a significant negative coefficient. Since
the reciprocal price is close to the cumulative value of past returns, this
indicates higher returns after periods of poor performance.
We examine the 82 firms in the CRSP monthly master file that have no

missing return information between 1926 and 1985. There are a number of Obvious
biases in a sample of this type. It is weighted toward large firms that have
been traded actively over the entire period. Firms that went bankrupt or began
trading during the sample period are necessarily excluded. Since the value
weighted NYSE index shows less mean reversion than the equal weighted index,
our sample of 82 large firms might display less mean reversion than a sample of

smaller stocks traded over shorter periods. For these 82 firms, however, we
compute variance ratios using both nominal and real returns. Because the
returns on different firms are not independent, we also examine the returns on
portfolios formed by buying one dollar of each firm, and short-selling $82 of

the aggregate market. That is, we examine properties of the time series
Rmt

-

where Rmt is the value—weighted NYSE return.14

The mean values of the individual firm variance ratios are shown in Table
5. They suggest some long-horizon mean reversion for individual stock prices

relative to the overall market or relative to a risk—free return. Although the

point estimates suggest that only twelve percent of the 8—year variance in firm

excess returns is due to stationary factors, the increased precision gained by
studying n:turns on many independent firms enables us to reject the null
hypothesis that all of the return variation arises from non-stationary factors.
However, there is also much less evidence than for the market aggregate of positive short—run serial correlation in excess returns, since the one—month
variance ratios are close to unity.

2.5. Summary
The power calculations of the last section demonstrate the difficulty of

detecting mean reversion in stock prices. Given the low power of available
tests, our results are quite striking. The point estimates generally suggest
that over long horizons return variance rises less than proportionally with
time, and in many cases imply more mean reversion than our examples in the last

section where transitory factors accounted for three—fourths of the variation in
returns. Many of the results imply rejections of the null hypothesis of serial
independence at the .16 level, a level that may not be inappropriate given our

previous discussion of size vs. power tradeoffs. Furthermore, each of the different types of data we analyze provides evidence of some deviation from serial

independence in stock returns. Taken together, the results are stronger than
any individual finding.

It is interesting to note that there is a clear tendency for more mean

reversion in less broad-based and sophisticated equity markets. The U.S. data
before 1925 show greater evidence of mean—reversion than the post-1926 data,

especially when we recognize that the appropriate comparison series for the

—21—

Standard and Poor's index is the value—weighted NYSE. The equal-weighted portfolio of NYSE stocks exhibits more mean reversion than the value-weighted port-

folio. In recent years, mean reversion is more pronounced in foreign countries
with less sophisticated equity markets than the United States.

3. The Substantive Importance of Transitory Components in Stock Prices

Our discussion so far has focused on the strength of the statistical evi-

dence regarding transitory price components. This section uses our point estimates of the degree of mean reversion in stock prices to assess their substant-

ive importance. One possible approach would involve calibrating models of the

class considered in the first section. We do not follow this strategy because
our finding of positive autocorrelation over short intervals implies that the

AR(1) specification of the transitory component is inappropriate. Instead, we
use an approach that does not require us to specify a process for the transitory
component, but allows us to focus on its standard deviation and the fraction of
the variance in one period returns that can be attributed to it.
We treat stock prices Pt as the sum of a permanent component and a trans-

itory component. The permanent component evolves as a random walk and the transitory component follows a stationary process, A(L)ut =

either case, describing the stochastic properties of u is a way of characterizing the part of stock price movements that cannot be explained on the basis of
changing expectations about future cash flows.

weighted monthly returns, and has a standard deviation of between 14 percent and

37 percent. Results for the value weighted portfolio similarly suggest that the
transitory component accounts for a large, though smaller, portion of the

variance in returns. Some estimates are as high as 56 percent.
As one would expect, Table 6 indicates that increasing the assumed
persistence of the transitory component raises both its standard deviation and
its contribution to the return variance. More persistent transitory components
are less able to account for declining variance ratios at long horizons.

Therefore, to rationalize any given long horizon variance ratio, increasing the
persistence of the transitory component will require increasing the weight on
the transitory component relat lye to the permanent component.

Sufficiently per-

sistent transitory components will be unable to account for low long horizon

variance ratios, even if they account for all of the variation I n returns.

For

example, a transitory component that is almost as persistent as a random wa 1k

will be unable to explain very much long-horizon mean reversion.

Which cases n Table 6 are most relevant? As an a priori matter, it is
difficult to see

a compel

ling argument for assuming that transitory components

should die out ext remely quickly. Previous suggestions that there are "fads" in
stock prices have typical ly suggested half ii yes of seve ral years, implying that

the elements in the table corresponding to p1 =

.70 are most relevant. If the

decay is geometric, this suggests a half life of two year s for the transitory

component. Even greater values of p12 might be even more plausible. One other
consideration supports th is conclusion. For given values of

A reasonable restriction,

that p1 not be very negative over periods of up to 96 months, is only satisfied

—25—

for cases where p12 is large. For example, with p96 = 0, when we impose p12
.35 the value of the stationary component's

autocorrelation is -.744 at

36 months, —1 27 at 60 months, and —.274 at 84 months.

Even more negative

values obtain assuming p12 = 0, and the results are also less satisfactory when
is positi ye. In contrast, when p12 = .70 and p96 = 0, the implied values of

36 and p60 are .168 and -.173, respectively. Similar results obtain for other
large values of p12. This is because variance ratios cont

Imposing larger autocorrelations at short horizons does not necess tate

such autocorrel a tion patterns.
Since other countries and historical periods exhibit patterns of variance

ratio decline that are similar to those in the American data, we do not present

calculations similar to those in Table 6 for them. As one would expect,
countries with 96-month variance ratios lower than those for the United States
have larger transitory components than the U.S., and vice versa.
Insofar as the evidence in the first section and in Fama and French (1987)
is persuasive in suggesting that transitory components in stock prices are present and statistically significant, this section's results confi rm Shiller's
(1981) conclusion that models assuming constant ex-ante returns cannot account
for a large fraction of the variance in stock market returns. Stock market volatility is excessive relati ye to the predictions of these models.15 Since our

analysis uses only returns data and does not exploit the present value relationship between stock prices and expected future dividends, it does not suffer from
some of the problems that have been highlighted in the volatility test debate.

4. The Source of the Transitory Component in Stock'Prices

If stock prices have a transitory component, ex-ante returns must vary.16
Any stochastic process for the transitory component can be mapped into a stochastic process for ex—ante returns, and any pattern for ex—ante returns can
alternatively be represented by describing the associated transitory component

of prices. The economically interesting issue is whether variations in ex-ante
returns are better explained by "fundamentals" such as changes in interest rates

or volatility17, or instead as byproducts of price deviations caused by noise

traders.18 This section notes a number of considerations that incline us toward
the latter view.

4.1 How Variable Must Risk Premia Be?
It is instructive to calibrate the amount of variation in expected returns
that risk factors would have to generate in order for them to account for the

observed transitory components in stock prices. To do this we assume for
simplicity that the transitory component follows an AR(1) process as postulated

in the "fads" example of Summers (1986). This has the virtue of tractability,
although it is inconsistent with the observation that actual returns exhibit
positive, then negative, serial correlation.
Changes over time in the required return on common stocks can generate

mean-reverting stock price behavior. If required returns exhibit positive autocorrelation, then an innovation that raises required returns will reduce share

prices. This will generate a holding period loss, followed by higher returns in
subsequent periods. We show in the appendix that when required returns follow
an AR(1) processl9, then

If

changes in required returns and profits are positively correlated, as is

plausible given the importance of shocks to the perceived productivity of
capital, then the assumption that

and

are orthogonal will understate the

variance in ex-ante returns needed to rationalize mean reversion in stock pri-

ces. Although it is possible to construct theoretical examples where profits
and interest rates are negatively related, as in Campbell (1986), the empirical

finding that bond and stock returns are weakly correlated suggests positive
correlation between shocks to cash flows and required returns.20 Negative correlation between

The simple model of stationary and nonstationary price components summar-

ized in equation (9) also yields an ARMA(1,1) representation for returns. This
allows us to calculate the amount of variation in required returns that would be
needed to generate the same time series process for observed returns as would be

generated by "fads" of various sizes in equation (6). We measure the size of
the standard deviation of the

fads, or transitory factors more generally, by

transitory component. In the appendix we show that the required return variance
corresponding to a given fad variance is:

This expression indicates the variation in required returns needed to generate
transitory components of a given size.

Table 7 reports the standard deviation of required excess returns, measured

on an annual basis, implied by a variety of different fad models. We calibrate
the calculations using the average excess return (8.9% per year) on the NYSE

equal-weighted share price index over the 1926-1985 period. The dividend yield
on these shares averages 4.5%, implying an average dividend growth rate of 4.4%.

We use our estimates of the variance ratio at 96 months (from Table 2) to
calibrate the degree of mean reversion.
The findings suggest that a great deal of variability in required returns

is needed to explain the degree of mean reversion in prices. For example, if we
postulate that the standard deviation of the transitory price component is 20%,
then even when required return shocks have a half life of 2.9 years, the stand-

ard deviation of ex ante returns (at an annual frequency) must be 5.8%. Even

-29-

larger amounts of required return variation are needed to explain the same size

price fads when the persistence of required return shocks is lower. These estimates of the standard deviation of required returns are large relative to the

mean of ex post excess returns. If ex ante returns are never negative, they
imply that ex ante returns must exceed 2O fairly frequently.
It is difficult to think of risk factors that could account for such large

variations in required returns. Campbell and Shiller's (1986) conclusion that
stock price movements have no predictive power for changes in discount rates is

especially relevant in this context. They reason that if stock price movements
are caused by changes in future discount rates, then realized values of future

discount rates should be Granger caused by stock prices. They find no evidence
that this is the case using data on real interest rates and market volatilities.
While they find evidence that stock prices Granger cause consumption, the sign
is counter to the theory's prediction.

4.2 Negative Ex—Ante Returns
The principle restriction implied by homogeneous expectations models of
financial markets is that ex-ante returns conditional on public information

can never be negative. This is not a property of some models with noise traders. Sufficiently optimistic noise traders may drive prices high enough to
make ex-ante returns negative, so risk averse speculators may not be willing or
able to short the market to the point where ex—ante returns are driven to zero.

There is an obvious problem with evaluating whether or not ex-ante returns

are ever negative. In estimating any model, there is a possibility of overfitting that may cause the spurious appearance of negative ex-ante returns.

—30-

This is especially likely when many parameters are present. Table 8 therefore
presents the fraction of ex—ante returns that were negative when various autoregressive models were estimated using the CRSP returns data for 1926-1985 along

with Monte—Carlo calculations of the share of negative ex-ante returns that
resulted when similar models were estimated using serially independent returns.
The results indicate that negative ex-arite returns show up reasonably

frequently, and to a greater extent than can be explained by statistical over-

fitting. For example, in a regression of monthly excess returns on 24 lags,
using the equal weighted data, 31.2 percent of the fitted values are negative

compared with 25 percent in the corresponding Monte-Carlo calculation. The
corresponding values for the value-weighted index are 33.3% and 28.1%, respect-

ively. Our Monte Carlo results show that the p-value associated with the
outcome for the equal-weighted case is .172, and for the value-weighted case,

.240. These results provide weak evidence against the risk factors hypothesis,

since they suggest negative ex-ante returns in some periods.21 Since it is not
possible to know in which periods ex ante returns are actually negative, they do
not have strong implications for investment strategy.

4.3 The Difficulty of Accounting f or the Observed Autocorrelogram
In section 2 we demonstrated that stock returns exhibited positive serial

correlation over short periods and negative serial correlation over longer

stretches. The AR(1) transitory components model treated in the previous subsection can rationalize the second but not the first of these observations. It
is instructive to consider what type of behavior for expected returns is
necessary to account for both observations.

—31—

Positive serial correlation in ex-post returns over short periods requires
that increases in prospective required returns that reduce stock prices are

followed by reduced returns. Shocks that have a large effect on the expected
discounted present value of required returns must not have a large impact on

required returns in the immediately succeeding periods. The impulse response
function for required returns must cross the zero—axis; a positive current shock
must lead to a reduction in

required

returns for a period in the immediate

future, followed by higher required returns at a later date. The analysis in
Poterba and Summers (1986) of the time series properties of volatility, as well
as Litterman and Weiss' (1986) work on the time series properties of real
interest rates, does not suggest that these series have the impulse response
functions needed to account for the behavior of market returns.

—32—

5. Conclusions
The empirical results in this paper suggest that stock returns exhibit
positive serial correlation over short periods and negative correlation over

longer intervals. This conclusion emerges from the standard CRSP data on equal
and value weighted returns over the 1926—1985 period.

It is corroborated by

data from the pre—1925 period, data for individual firms, and data on stock

returns in seventeen foreign countries. While individual data sets do not consistently permit rejection of the random walk hypothesis at a high confide nce
level, the various data sets taken together establish a fair]y strong case

against its validity. Furthermore our point estimates generally suggest that
the transitory component in stock prices is quantitatively important, accounting
for the bulk of the variance in returns.
While the temptation to apply more soph isticated statistical techniques
to stock return data in an effort to extract more information about the magnitude and structure of transi tory components is ever present, we doubt that a

great deal can be learned in this way. Even the re latively gross features of
the data examined in this paper cannot be estimated precisely. As the debate
over volatility tests has illustrated, sophisticated statistical results are
often very sensitive to ma intained assumptions that are difficult to evaluate.
We have checked all the statistical procedures used in this paper by applying
them to pseudo data conforming exact ly to the random walk model. Our suspicion,

supported by the dramatic illustrations in Kleidon

1986), is that a great deal

of more elaborate work on stock price volatility could not meet this test.

We suggest in the papers final section that noise trading provides a
plausible account for the transitory components that are present in stock

—33—

prices. Pursuing this issue will involve constructing and testing theories of
either noise trading or changing risk factors that can account for the

characteristic stock return autocorrellogram documented here. Evaluating such
theories is likely to require that information other than stock returns be
studied. Such information might include information on fundamental values,
proxies for noise trading such as odd—lot sales, and indicators of risk factors

such as ex-ante volatilit-les implied from stock market options. Only by
comparing the persuasiveness of models based on the presence of noise traders
and models based on changing risk factors, can we come to a judgment about

whether or not financial markets are efficient in the sense of rationally
valuing assets, as well as in the sense of precluding the generation of easy
excess profits.

Endnotes

1. This point is independent of Fischer's (1984) conclusion in analyzing the
appropriate portfolio strategy for an investor concerned about terminal
consumption but restricted in the frequency with which he can rebalance his
portfolio. Our conclusion applies to investors who can rebalance continuously,
as most investors probably can.
2. Stochastic speculative bubbles, considered by Blanchard and Watson
(1982), could generate deviations between market prices and fundamental values
without negative serial correlation in returns. In the presence of any limits
on valuation errors set by speculators or real investment opportunities,
however, such bubbles could not exist.
3. Testing the relationship between the variability of returns at different
horizons has a long tradition: Osborne (1959) and Alexander (1961) apply tests
similar to the variance ratio to much shorter data samples.

4. When in subsequent sections we examine annual returns data, the denominator of the variance ratio is simply Var(R).
5. When the horizon of the variance ratio is large relative to the sample
size, this bias can be substantial. For example, with 1=720 and k=60, the bias
is -.069. It rises to —.160 if k=12O. Detailed Monte Carlo analysis of the
variance ratio statistic may be found in Lo and MacKini ay (1987b).

7. We compute the likelihood value under each hypothesis using the exact
maximum likelihood method described in Harvey (1981). Because of the bias
toward negative autocorrelations induced by estimating the mean return in each
data sample, the mean likelihood ratios are actually above one for each of the
hypotheses we consider.
8.
Real returns are analyzed in Fama and French (1987), a revision of Fama
and French (1986a).

9. These p-values are calculated from the empirical distribution of our test
statistic, based on Monte Carlo results. They permit rejection at lower levels
than would be possible using the normal approximation to the distribution of the
variance ratio, along with the Monte Carlo estimates of the standard deviation
of the variance ratio.

—35—

10. French and Roll (1986) apply varlance ratio tests to daily returns for a
sample of NYSE and AMEX stocks for the period 1963—1982. They find evidence of
negative serial correlation especially among smaller securities. The divergence
between their findings and those of Lo and Mackinlay (1987a) is presumably due
to differences in the two data sets.
11. These data have been used in some studies of stock market volatility,
such as SMiler (1981).

12. The monthly stock index data from the IFS also suffer from a second
limitation. In many cases they are time averages of daily or weekly index
values. Working (1960) showed that the first difference of a time—averaged ran—
dom walk would exhibit positive ser ial correlation, with a first order autocorrelation coefficient of .25 as the number of observations in the average
becomes large. This will bias our estimated variance ratios. For the countries
with time aggregated data we therefore modify our small-sample bias correction.
Instead of taking the expected val ue of the first-order autocorrelation to be
we use .25-11(1-1). The reported variance
—11(1-1) when evaluating E(VR(k))
ratios have been bias-adjusted by dividing by the resulting expected value.
13. The cross—country correlation of own—currency returns is typically below
.25 in our data sample. Only five of the 171 pairwise correlat ions for the
eighteen countries we consider (including the U.S.) exceed .50.
14. We also applied variance ratio tests to the residuals from the market
model estimated for each firm, imposing a constant
for the entire 1926—1985
period. These residuals showed less correlation than the excess returns relative to the market, computed as

mt

15. Shiller's conclusion that market returns are too volatile to be
reconciled with valuation models assuming constant required returns has been
disputed by Kleidon (1986) and Marsh and Merton (1986). Mankiw, Romer, and
Shapiro (1985) provide evidence in support of Shiller's conclusion
16. Several recent studies have considered the extent to which equity returns
can be predicted using various information sets. Keim and Stambaugh (1986) find
that between eight and thirteen percent of the variation in returns for a portfolio of stocks in the bottom quintile of the NYSE can be predicted using lagged
information. A much smaller share of the variation in returns to larger companies can be accounted for in this way. Campbell (1987) finds that approximately eleven percent of the variation in excess returns can be explained on the
basis of lagged information derived from the term structure.
17. Market efficiency does not require constant ex ante returns, and the
models of Lucas (1978) and Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985) study the pricing of
assets with time—varying required returns. Fama and French (1986b) show that
the negative serial correlation in different stocks may be attributable to a
common factor, and interpret this finding as supporting the view that
time—varying returns account for mean-reversion in prices.
18. Several recent papers, including Black (1986), Campbell and Kyle (1986),
DeLong et al. (1987), and Shiller (1984), have discussed the role of noise
traders in security pricing.

—36—

19. The possibility of negative expected excess returns is an unattractive
feature of the simple model we have analyzed. In principle the analysis could
be repeated using Mertons (1980) model, which constrains the expected excess
return to be positive. The exact parallel between the time—varying returns
model and the fads model would not hold in this case, however.
20. Campbell (1987) estimates that the correlation between excess returns on
long—term bonds and corporate equities was .22 for the 1959—1979 period, and .36
for the more recent 1979—83 period.

21. We perform Monte Carlo calculations holding the expected return on the
market constant at its sample mean value. If required returns varied through
time, but were always positive, it -is possible that the fraction of negative
predicted returns would be greater than our Monte Carlo results suggest.
