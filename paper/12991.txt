ABSTRACT
A simple model of offshoring, which depicts offshoring as 'shadow migration,' permits straightforward
derivation of necessary and sufficient conditions for the effects on wages, prices, production and trade.
We show that offshoring requires modification of the four classic international trade theorems, so econometricians
who ignore offshoring might reject the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem when a properly specified version
held in the data. We also show that offshoring is an independent source of comparative advantage
and can lead to intra-industry trade in a Walrasian setting. The model is extended to allow for two-way
offshoring between similar nations, and to allow for monopolistic competition.

Abstract
A simple model of offshoring, which depicts offshoring as ‘shadow migration,’ permits
straightforward derivation of necessary and sufficient conditions for the effects on wages,
prices, production and trade. We show that offshoring requires modification of the four
classic international trade theorems, so econometricians who ignore offshoring might reject
the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem when a properly specified version held in the data. We also
show that offshoring is an independent source of comparative advantage and can lead to
intra-industry trade in a Walrasian setting. The model is extended to allow for two-way
offshoring between similar nations, and to allow for monopolistic competition.

1. INTRODUCTION
The fragmentation and offshoring of production processes has been an important phenomenon for
many years (Hummels, Ishii, and Yi 2001), having started in earnest in the mid-1980s in East Asia and
across the US-Mexico border. Ando and Kimura (2005) and Urata (2001), for example, document the
linked rise of foreign direct investment, offshoring, and parts and components trade by Japanese firms
in East Asia. In North America, the 1980s saw the widespread emergence of ‘twin plants’ (one on
either side of the US-Mexico border) under the Maquiladora programme (Dallas Fed 2002, Feenstra
and Hanson 1996). More recently, offshoring has spread from the manufacturing to the service sector
(Amiti and Wei 2005).
The observed empirical effects of offshoring do not sit easily with simple partial equilibrium models
that view one job shifted overseas as one job lost. For example, in both the US and Japanese cases, the
widespread offshoring of manufacturing jobs that started in the mid-1980s was not accompanied by a
general decline in manufacturing employment until the late 1990s (Debande 2006). Likewise, two
recent studies of micro data find that expansion of employment in affiliates in low income countries
raises the skill intensity of domestic production (see Head and Ries 2002 on Japanese data and
Geishecker and Gorg 2004 on German data). Understanding such effects requires a general
equilibrium framework where wages, prices, production and trade patterns adjust to offshoring.
Responding to this need, some of the world’s best trade economists have put forth general equilibrium
models of offshoring/fragmentation. As we argue in the sequel, these models can be viewed as a
collection of insightful special cases. In addition, many of them have a complex structure that forced
their authors to rely on numerical simulations to study their equilibrium properties.

Baldwin & Robert-Nicoud: Offshoring: General Equilibrium effects

Our model

The purpose of our paper is to present a simple model of offshoring that enables us to develop
necessary and sufficient conditions for signing the wage, price, production and trade effects of
offshoring in source and host countries. Our baseline model finds firms in all sectors unbundling the
production process and putting fragments of it abroad to take advantage of low-cost foreign factors of
production. Importantly, our model avoids the analytic complexity of multi-cone models and factorintensity reversals. Non-factor-price-equalisation exists under free trade due to Hicks-neutral
technological differences among nations. Despite the resulting effective factor price equalisation,
offshoring by the technologically advanced nation is cost-saving since offshoring firms can take their
superior technology with them when they shift production abroad.2 Since neither nation is specialised
in production, our baseline model can be studied in the familiar setting of Jones (1965) and this allows
us to consider a wide range of effects including the impact of offshoring on the four theorem of
Heckscher-Ohlin trade theory. In particular, we show that offshoring leads to intra-industry trade in a
perfectly competitive, Heckscher-Ohlin-like setting and that offshoring is, by itself, a source of
comparative advantage. The general equilibrium incidences on production, prices and wages are
shown to be ambiguous in general and we characterise the factors that lead the ambiguity to resolve
itself in one direction or the other. Importantly, we find that the factor owners of the offshoring nation
are typically better off as a result of fragmentation (controlling for terms of trade effects).
We work with two main variants of the basic model. In the first, which we call the service-task case
(mostly for terminological convenience), all offshored production is re-imported to the Home nation.
In the second, which we call the goods-task case, local sales are possible in the sense that offshore
production units can supply Foreign firms as well as Home firms. In the goods-task case, the gains
from offshoring are shared between nations and factor within nations, while in the service-task case
Foreign wages are unaffected by offshoring (apart from possible terms of trade effects).
Finally, we provide two simple model extensions. The first allows for two-way intra-industry
offshoring – an important extension since the largest importers and exporters of offshored services are
the United States and other large OECD countries (Amiti and Wei 2005). The second allows for
offshoring in a monopolistic competition model where the notion of a firm is better defined than it is in
the Walrasian setting (but comparison with the four Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) theorems is less evident).
The literature

Early on, Heckscher-Ohlin theory saw a number of contributions that incorporated trade in
intermediate goods (see Batra and Casas 1973, Woodland 1977, and Dixit and Grossman 1982), but
the most commonly cited reference in the offshoring/fragmentation literature is Jones and Kierzkowski
(1990). The Jones-Kierzkowski paper crystallised the insight that fragmentation/offshoring can be
thought of as technological progress and thus should be expected – as per Jones (1965) – to have
complex effects. This line of modelling – which includes Jones and Marjit (1992), Arndt (1997, 1999),
Jones and Findlay (2000, 2001), Jones and Kierzkowski (1998, 2000), and Jones, Kierzkowski and
Leonard (2002) – is based on verbal and diagrammatic analysis (typically of small open economies)
that assumes fragmentation occurs in only one sector and in one direction. See Francois (1990a,b,c) for
formal, general-equilibrium modelling of the central mechanism in the Jones-Kierzkowski
fragmentation story – the way in which the liberalisation of service links can promote the
fragmentation of production blocks.3
The general equilibrium impact of Jones-Kierzkowski fragmentation varies according to the special
case considered, with cases varying along three main dimensions: the factor intensity of the sector that

is fragmented, the factor intensity of the process that is offshored, and the offshoring nation’s relative
endowment. The Jones and Kierzkowski (1998) diagrammatic analysis yields examples that suggest
two important insights – what might be called the “Jones ambiguity” and the “anti-Stolper-Samuelson
possibility.” Using a pair of special cases, Jones and Kierzkowski (1998) argue that workers whose
jobs are “lost” to offshoring may see their wages rise in one case, but fall in the other.4 The “antiStolper-Samuelson” insight, which stems from viewing fragmentation as technological progress, notes
that freer offshoring/fragmentation – unlike freer trade in goods – need not produce winners and losers
among factor owners.5
Contributions that study the price, wage, production and trade effects of offshoring in explicit
mathematical models include Deardorff (1989a, b), Venables (1999), Kohler (2004a), Markusen
(2005), and Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2006a,b). These papers present a gallery of special cases
that firmly establish the ambiguous sign of the general equilibrium price, production, trade and factor
price effects. A linchpin issue facing all general equilibrium models in this literature is the question of
how offshoring can be cost-saving when international trade in goods naturally leads to factor price
equalisation. To address this issue, these papers work in models marked by non-factor price
equalisation. Since non-factor price equalisation typically prevents utilisation of the elegant Jones
(1965) tools, the analysis in these papers is quite complex. Most of these authors also assume that
offshoring/fragmentation occurs in only one sector and only in one direction (to keep the analysis
manageable).
Deardorff (1989a,b) studies fragmentation in a range of explicit models using graphical analysis. The
main formal analysis, however, concerns a HO setting where cost-saving offshoring occurs since
nations’ endowments are assumed to lie in different diversification cones. Deardorff (1989a) argues
that fragmentation/offshoring may or may not foster factor price convergence. Working with LernerPearce diagrammatic analysis of a general model with fragmentation in a single sector, he notes “if
you accept this argument, then such a move toward factor price equality is not at all assured. It
depends crucially on … the factor intensities both of the fragments and of the original technology.
There are many possibilities, including that relative factor prices move in the same direction in both
countries and that they both move either together or further apart. (p. 14)” Necessary and sufficient
conditions are not established. He then moves to explicit mathematical analysis using a 2-nation, 2factor, many-good, multi-cone HO model with Cobb-Douglas tastes and technology. He derives
explicit expressions for relative factor prices in the two nations, showing that the wage ratios depend
upon the national capital-labour ratios and national weighted average of the factor intensity of
produced goods. Fragmentation changes the latter and can thus lead to a convergence or divergence of
relative factor prices (no expressions are given for the level of factor prices). The paper concludes by
noting that “the effects on relative factor prices in the countries where the fragmentation takes place
depend fairly systematically on the factor intensities of the fragments, as well as that of the original
technology. What matters, however, is how these factor intensities compare to the average intensities
of processes in use in each country before fragmentation, not their intensities compared to all goods
produced globally.” Necessary and sufficient conditions for relative factor price convergence are not
derived but are implicit in the expressions.
Venables (1999) works with a standard 2x2x2 HO model and generates non-factor-price equalisation
with a factor intensity reversal. Nations can thus have different factor prices without being specialised

4

Referring to a HO model with capital and labour, Jones and Kierzkowski (1998, p. 373) write: “the charge that if
international trade causes a nation to lose a production activity which is intensive in the use of labour, it will cause the
wage to fall, need not be true – especially for relatively capital-abundant nations.”
5

Jones and Kierzkowski (1998, p. 380) write: “But even here the prognosis for a nation’s labour supply need not be
gloomy, since such fragmentation tends as well to work like technical progress in raising the returns to all factors.”

in production. As in the Jones-Kierzkowski tradition, fragmentation occurs in only one industry and
offshoring occurs in only one direction (the labour-intensive segment is offshored to the labour
abundant nation). Using numerical simulations and Lerner-Pearce diagrammatic analysis, he concludes
that “production fragmentation does not necessarily lead to convergence of factor prices,” and provides
examples of both cases without developing necessary and sufficient conditions. The paper goes on to
note that “fragmentation may change factor prices by changing the composition of Home exports, as
well as imports” and that “it is possible to generate some curious cases in which it is the relatively
capital intensive industry, not the labour intensive which leaves Home for Foreign,” (curious since
Home is capital-rich).
Kohler (2004a) works with a specific factors model where fragmentation can only occur in one sector.
Discussion of the source of non-factor price equalisation is avoided by assuming a small open
economy where all goods prices and Foreign wages are immutably fixed (in the Jones-Kierzkowski
tradition). The focus of the analysis is on the reward to the specific capital that moves offshore when
fragmentation occurs, and the overall welfare effects on the small open economy.
Markusen (2005) works with a 2x2x2 HO model where one sector fragments, and he, like Deardorff,
generates non-factor-price equalisation by assuming the two nation are in different diversification
cones (i.e. their endowments are so different that they produce no goods in common in equilibrium).
Analytic results with multi-cone models are difficult (due to the inequality constraints), so the paper
studies offshoring/fragmentation via numerical simulations based on the complementary slackness
approach. Fragmentation is assumed to occur in the skill-intensive sector and the offshored segment is
assumed to be of middling skill-intensity. Offshoring therefore tends to increase the relative demand
for skilled labour – and thus the skill premium – in both nations, but terms of trade effects can –
depending upon the nations’ relative sizes – reverse this direct effect. One of the numerical simulations
even shows the possibility of both factors losing in the offshoring nation (necessary and sufficient
conditions are not established). Another simulation shows an anti-Stolper-Samuelson result whereby
the skilled workers in the unskilled-labour-rich nation gain from offshoring in an absolute sense, but
they gain less than their fellow unskilled workers. Markusen (2005) points out the limitation of the
analysis: “In spite of doing countless runs of this model, I cannot guarantee that there are not other
possibilities and, of course, reordering the factor intensities will change the results. What I can say is
that it is easy to find ranges of parameters that generate these results, but we should all regard them as
suggestive and not definitive.” The paper goes on to simulate four other models that vary in terms of
the number of factors, the substitutability of factors in various sectors, and the factor-intensity of the
offshored process and offshoring sector. The paper closes by noting “I view the paper as listing a
number of plausible and empirically-relevant ways of modelling the offshoring of white-collar
services…. Unfortunately, it is hard to offer robust conclusions.”
Kohler (2004b) works with a small open economy where fragmentation/offshoring can only happen in
one sector. He departs from other models, however, in using a radically different production structure
– that of Dixit and Grossman (1982) where final good production involves of continuum of
intermediate stages, each of which requires capital and labour. The production stages are strict
complements in that producing the final good requires each one to be performed in fixed proportions.
At the cost of additional assumptions on the capital intensity of upstream versus downstream stages of
production, the Dixit-Grossman production structure yields a very simple characterisation of the
endogenous range of stages that are offshored given an exogenously specified range of offshoring
costs for each stage of production. The focus of his analysis is on establishing a ‘generalised factor
price frontier’ that takes account of the shifts in the range of stages that are offshored when prices or
offshoring costs change exogenously. When prices change, he shows that offshoring can heighten or
dampen the magnification aspect of the Stolper-Samuelson effects. He also shows that cheaper
offshoring produces more offshoring and this raises or lowers factor prices according to the relative

4

Baldwin & Robert-Nicoud: Offshoring: General Equilibrium effects

factor intensity of the two sectors and the fragments offshored. No formal results are presented on
production and trade effects.
More recently, Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2006a,b) – GRH for short – present a formal model
where the wage effects of offshoring are unambiguous. GRH (2006a), for example, highlights the case
where offshoring unambiguously raises the wage of workers whose jobs are offshored (controlling for
terms of trade effects). The unambiguous effect is driven by the fact that offshoring acts a
technological progress – what they call the productivity effect. Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2006b)
explore the issues in greater depth, confirming the unambiguous productivity effect on wages in
certain cases. GRH also identify an anti-Stolper-Samuelson effect. As they argue (using ‘trade in tasks’
as a synonym for offshoring): “reductions in the cost of trading tasks can generate shared gains for all
domestic factors, in contrast to the distributional conflict that typically results from reductions in the
cost of trading goods. (GRH 2006b, abstract)” GRH present an array of models to illustrate their
findings, but the common core of their models is a technological specification akin to the Dixit and
Grossman (1982) model. Unlike Kohler (2004b), however, the stages (called ‘tasks’) require only
unskilled labour (L-tasks) or only skilled labour (H-tasks). Substitution between the L-task and H-task
continuums is possible, but L-tasks are strict complements in that producing the final good requires
each task to be performed in fixed proportions; the same holds for H-tasks.
Organisation of paper

The next section, Section 2, presents a simplified HO model and briefly lays out the four standard
trade theorems in order to fix ideas and introduce notation. The next section presents our model of
offshoring, characterises the equilibrium, and then shows how offshoring requires a modification of
the four standard trade theorems. Section 3 presents our extensions. The final section presents our
concluding remarks.

TRADE IN GOODS IN A MODIFIED HO MODEL

To introduce our notation and normalisations, we introduce the familiar 2x2x2 HO model and
demonstrate the four theorems. The model assumes two nations, Home and Foreign, two final goods, X
and Y, and two primary factors, human capital (K) and labour (L). Tastes are homothetic and identical
across nations; Foreign is relatively abundantly endowed with labour and Y is the K-intensive good:

κY > κ X ;

κY ≡

aKY
a
, κ X ≡ KX
aLY
aLX

(1)

where κi is the capital intensity of sector-i and the Leontief aij’s employ the standard factor- and sectorsubscript notation.
Home is assumed to be technologically superior in the Hicks-neutral sense (Davis 1995, Trefler 1993).
Specifically, all Foreign unit input requirements are γ > 1 times higher than Home’s. Since aij*= γaij
(“*” indicates Foreign variables), (1) also holds for Foreign technology. Note that the Hicks-neutral
technology differences do not give rise to Ricardian motives for trade in our model. Indeed, we can
mechanically transform the model into a standard HO model by defining Foreign factor supplies in
‘effective units’, i.e. dividing L* and K* by the technological-inferiority-factor γ.
In autarky, the Home or Foreign equilibriums are characterised by two pricing equations, two
employment equations and a market clearing condition. The pricing equations in the two nations are:6

6

In general, these should be inequalities; we use equalities since we assume that parameters are such that both nations’
production structures are diversified at the sectoral level with free trade, i.e. they share a diversification cone. This requires
them to have sufficiently similar endowment ratios, in a way that we formalise in the sequel.

Autarky and free trade equilibrium factor prices, which follow from (5) and (4), are:
Autarky: p =

(
)
aLX / aLY k* −κ X

α /(1 − α ) κ Y − kɶ w
Trade: p =
(
)
aLX / aLY kɶ w − κ X

(6)

where the lower-case k’s are national endowment ratios, i.e. k ≡ K / L and k * ≡ K* / L* and kɶ w is the
world capital-labour ratio measured in effective units, namely kɶ w ≡ ( K + K*/γ ) /( L + L*/γ ) . We use “~”
to denote factor supplies measured in effective units. The non-specialisation regularity condition – i.e.
κ X < k * < kɶ w < k < κ Y – implies that all endogenous variables are positive in equilibrium.
The Factor Price Equalisation (FPE) theorem states that free trade equalises factor prices
internationally by equalising goods prices. Here the FPE theorem holds but for ‘effective’ units of
factors, i.e. counting an hour of Foreign labour as 1/γ times an hour of Home labour. From (5), the
international ratio of wages in terms of the numeraire is γ.
The Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) theorem states that the relatively L-rich nation exports the L-intensive
good and imports the K-intensive good. Home imports of X, using (5) and (6), are:
MX =

α L k − kɶ w
(
)
aLX kɶ w − κ X

(7)

Specifically, preferences are given by U=X1-αYα and E=X+pY=wL+rK in Home, with an isomorphic definition for E*.
The loss of generality that results from assuming a specific functional form for preferences is more than compensated by
the two following facts: first, this assumption is not necessary to generate any of our general results regarding the effects on
factor prices and production patterns. Second, it allows us to derive explicit closed-form solutions for equilibrium terms-oftrade and trade volumes; the qualitative effects would remain unchanged if we allowed for general homothetic preferences.

7

6

Baldwin & Robert-Nicoud: Offshoring: General Equilibrium effects

where MX is our notation for Home imports of X. Since the denominator is positive (the world’s
endowment is within the diversification cone), Home imports the L-intensive good if and only if its
capital-labour endowment ratio exceeds the world’s effective capital-labour endowment ratio. This
demonstrates the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem since trade balance implies that the value of Home’s
exports of Y equals -MX.
The Stolper-Samuelson theorem is a partial equilibrium result (p is exogenous) that connects goods
and factor prices; a rise in the price of the K-intensive good raises r more than proportionally and
lowers w. This can be seen from log differentiation of the solution for w and r in (5):
dw / w
−p
=
< 0,
dp / p aKY / aKX − p

dr / r
p
=
>1
dp / p p − aLY / aLX

(8)

This means that r rises more than proportionally with p and w actually falls, so qualitatively the w and
r changes are like real wage changes. (The inequalities follow from our factor intensity assumptions as
usual.)
The Rybczynski theorem is a partial equilibrium result (p is exogenous) which states, in its simple
form, that a rise in a nation’s endowment of L raises its production of the L-intensive good more than
proportionally and lowers its production of the other good. Log differentiating (5):

κY
dX / X

> 1,
dL / L κY − k

−κ X

=
<0
dL / L k − κ X

3. A SIMPLE MODEL OF THE OFFSHORING
This section modifies the HO model to allow for offshoring/fragmentation. We model the production
of X as involving three “tasks” labelled X1, X2 and X3, which can be thought of segments of the
production process (in which case the task’s output is an intermediate good) or service inputs.
Likewise, Y production involves tasks Y1, Y2 and Y3. In the HO model, the tasks were bundled into aLX
and aKX. Here we allow them to be unbundled and their production potentially placed abroad, i.e.
offshored. Each task involves some L and K, so the aij’s can be decomposed into task-by-task Leontief
unit input coefficients:

a LX ≡ a LX 1 + a LX 2 + a LX 3 ,

a KX ≡ a KX 1 + a KX 2 + a KX 3

(10)

where the L and K unit inputs for task-i in sector j denotes as aLji and aKji. The coefficients for Y are
decomposed into task requirements in an isomorphic manner. In the spirit of the HO model, the
international transportation of the fruit of each task is costless.
A key to offshoring is our assumption that firms that offshore a task (i.e. place its production abroad)
can combine their own nation’s technology with labour in the other nation, paying the local wage
rather than workers’ marginal products. In this way, offshoring from the high-technology/high-wage
nation to the low-technology/low-wage nation may be economic despite the effective factor price
equalisation. Offshoring from the low-technology nation to the advanced-technology nation, by
contrast, will never be economic.
While offshoring tends to reduce costs, it may not occur if the cost of coordinating spatially separated
tasks is too great. To be explicit about the coordination costs and the nature of tasks, we assume that
individual tasks are not equally easy to separate spatially from the other two tasks. We model the
coordination costs as being of the iceberg type. That is, production of a unit of X1 by a Home firm in
Foreign requires χ(X1)aLX1 and χ(X1)aKX1 units of L and K, where χ(X1) ≥ 1. Note that it is as if
offshoring causes deterioration in the offshoring firm’s production technology (due to the extra
coordination costs). χ(i) varies according to the task and, without loss of generality, we order the tasks

7

Baldwin & Robert-Nicoud: Offshoring: General Equilibrium effects

such that task X1 is the cheapest to offshore, X2 the next cheapest and X3 the most expensive. We
impose an isomorphic ordering on Y-sector tasks.
The per-unit offshoring costs χ relates to the cost of coordinating spatially separate tasks within the
same firm. In addition, depending upon the nature of the task, it may be much harder to coordinate the
three tasks when tasks are performed by different firms – especially when the task involves firmspecific services, many of which may be idiosyncratic, such as accounting services (which involves
firm-specific peculiarities) or telephone help-lines (which involve firm-specific training). While it is
possible to model this decision more precisely, doing so would make it difficult to compare offshoring
with traditional trade in goods. This leads us to introduce an extra set of coordination-cost parameters
that simplify the problem. It costs χ(X1) to offshore task X1 to Foreign when tasks X2 and X3 are
undertaken by the same firm in Home, but is costs ζ(X1) to coordinate the three tasks when task X1 is
done in a separate firm from task X2 and X3 – and this regardless of whether they are undertaken in the
same nation. (The same holds for all the other tasks.)8
For the sake of analytic clarity, we consider two cases. The first case takes the ζ’s as sufficiently high
to make inter-firm trade in tasks uneconomical. Thus even if Home firms offshore task X1 to Foreign,
they will not supply task X1 to Foreign producers. The second takes the ζ’s as zero so inter-firm trade
in tasks becomes economical. For the sake of terminological clarity, we refer to the first case (i.e. no
local sales of offshored production) as offshoring of the service-tasks case (although it could also hold
for the offshoring of some firm-specific intermediate goods) and the second case (i.e. local sales as
economical) as manufacturing-tasks case.
Deviation analysis: Service task offshoring

To find conditions under which offshoring occurs, we examine the problem facing an atomistic Home
X producer that is considering offshoring a task, when no offshoring is yet occurring. Since no
offshoring has occurred in this thought-experiment, but trade in goods is free, the analysis from the
previous section implies that the low- and high-skill wage gap will be γ (i.e. w = w*γ and r = r*γ).
Offshoring is economical if:

wa LX 1 + ra KX 1 >

wa LX 1 + ra KX 1

γ

χ ( X 1)

⇔

γ > χ ( X 1)

(11)

where the first sum is marginal cost of task X1 without offshoring and the second is marginal cost with
offshoring, i.e. when the Home firm uses Home technology but pays Foreign factor prices, taking
account of the iceberg coordination costs. Plainly, task X1 is offshored only if γ > χ ( X 1) .
Many cases can arise since the firm might want to offshore tasks X1 and X2, or X2 and X3, or X1 and
X3, or even X1, X2 and X3. To work through all of these, we would have to detail the coordination
costs of each proposed bundle and this could be complex since coordination costs are unlikely to be
separable. Since the purpose here is to illustrate the fact that offshoring (i.e. trade in tasks) leads to
some outcomes that are very different than those obtained with only trade in goods, we discipline the
range of cases by making restrictive assumptions. Specifically, we assume that when trade in both
goods and tasks is allowed, the coordination costs for X1 and Y1 are nil while the coordination costs of
offshoring X2, X3, Y2 and Y3 are prohibitive.
Given this simplifying assumption, the atomistic Home firm would find it profitable to offshore task
X1 to Foreign. Moreover, an atomistic Home firm in the Y sector would also find it profitable to
offshore tasks Y1 to Foreign. Of course, other firms would follow and the re-organisation of work

Section 5.2 shows our results all got through in a monopolistic competition trade model where firms are well-defined; we
stick with the HO setting to improve comparison with the four theorems and the main offshoring/fragmentation literature.

Baldwin & Robert-Nicoud: Offshoring: General Equilibrium effects

would change prices, wages, production patterns and trade. We turn to working out the new
international equilibrium with free trade in both tasks and goods. Note that Foreign firms would never
offshore to Home since this would involve combining inferior Foreign technology with expensive
Home factors of production.

3.1. Service task offshoring
As discussed above, we roughly associate service-sector offshoring with the case where all offshore
production is re-imported to Home because no X1 or Y1 can be sold to Foreign firms by assumption.
Given that tasks X1 and Y1 are offshored, the new employment and pricing equations are:

The pricing equations for Foreign are unaltered by the offshoring (Foreign firms continue to use
Foreign technology and Foreign labour as before). When we work with explicit solutions for X, Y, w or
r, we take the coordination costs to be zero, i.e. χ ( X 1) = χ (Y 1) = 1 .
Shadow migration

This offshoring-cum-tech-transfer acts like ‘shadow migration.’ Home firms use some Foreign L and K
to produce goods using Home technology just as if the Foreign L and K migrated to Home and worked
in the Home X and Y sectors (but got paid the foreign wages). We assume that the shadow migration is
not large enough to move ‘effective’ endowment ratios outside of the diversification cone, so
production remains diversified. Rearranging (12), the employment equations are:

defines the equilibrium amounts of the shadow migration, ∆L and ∆K, and the world shadow effective
endowments with offshoring. (For closed form solutions, see Appendix.) The definitions of LɶwO and
Kɶ w make it clear that offshoring is like an expansion in the world supply of factors (measured in
O

effective units). The shadow migration amounts, ∆L and ∆K, are positive given our regularity
condition that stipulates that production remain diversified in both nations even after offshoring.

3.1.1.
General equilibrium incidence on prices, wages, output and trade
We turn now to determination of the post-offshoring prices, wages, output and trade flows.
Price effects. Solving (13) for X Ow and YOw , and using the market-clearing condition, the postoffshoring price is:
pO =

α /(1 − α ) κ Y − kɶOw
(
)
aLX / aLY kɶOw − κ X

(15)

Comparing this to (6), we see that Y becomes dearer (pO > p), if and only if shadow migration lowers
⌢
⌢
the world effective capital-labour ratio, i.e. kɶOw < k w . From (13), kɶOw < k w holds when the shadow Lmigration is proportionally greater than shadow K-migration (relative to the pre-offshoring world
effective labour supplies), i.e. if ∆L / Lɶw > ∆K / Kɶ w . To summarise:

Proposition 1:
Offshoring of either type of labour changes the world price of final goods. The
relative price of capital-intensive good Y rises if the shadow K-migration is proportionally
less than the shadow L-migration.
Production effects. Combining the shadow-migration insight and Rybczynski logic, it is intuitive
that offshoring’s general equilibrium incidence on production are ambiguous in sign and depend upon
the relative shadow migration of L and K. Solving (12) for the post-offshoring production and using
(5), the production effects of offshoring are:

XO   X 
−1  ∆L 
 Y  =  Y  + A  ∆K  ,

1 −1  ∆L 
 *  =  *  − ( )A  
γ
 ∆K 
 YO   Y 

(16)

where X, Y, X* and Y* are defined in (5). This shows, as anticipated by the Rybczynski logic, that
Home X output rises if ∆K/∆L is lower than κY and Home Y output either rises less or falls.9 The
necessary and sufficient condition of Y output to fall is ∆K/∆L < κX. From (16), the change in Foreign
product has the opposite sign as the change in Home production effects, but the magnitudes are
mitigated by the Foreign technological disadvantage γ. Specifically, ∆X* = -∆X/γ and ∆Y* = -∆Y/γ,
where ∆ indicates change. The various outcomes are depicted in the left-panel of Figure 1. The usual
Jonesian magnification effects are in operation.10 To summarise:

Proposition 2:
Offshoring can be viewed as shadow migration of Foreign L and K. The impact
on Home production follows a Rybczynski-like pattern, if offshoring implies a very
unbalanced ratio of K versus L shadow migration, but the output of both sectors may rise if
the amounts of L and K shadow migration are fairly similar. The exact limits are shown in
Figure 1. Standard Jonesian magnification effects occur.
Wage effects. Combing the cost-savings aspect of the shadow-migration insight with StolperSamuelson logic, it is intuitive that the general equilibrium incidence of offshoring on wages is
ambiguous. For example, if offshoring leads to a great deal of cost-saving in the L-intensive sector –
which acts like a rise in the price of X as per (14) – then w rises and r tends to fall. More precisely, we
solve (14) for the post-offshoring wages:

The solutions are ∆X≡XO-X=(κY-∆K/∆L) ∆L/aLX/(κY-κX) and ∆Y≡YO-Y=(∆K/∆L-κX) ∆L/aLY/(κY-κX). Since the denominators
are positive, the sign of the production effect turns on the difference between ∆K/∆L and the κ’s.

9

10

For example, ∆X/X ={(∆L/L) /(1- k/κY) - (∆K/K)/(κY/k-1)} and k/κY < 1 since both economies’ product is diversified.

where ∆p ≡ pO − p , and w, r, w* and r* are defined in (5). This shows that the wage of Home Lworkers rises (controlling for terms of trade effects ∆p), if and only if the cost-savings is sufficiently
greater in the L-intensive sector than in the K-intensive sector. Using well-know solutions for (17), the
precise necessary and sufficient condition is SX/SY > aKX/aKY. Additionally, r rises less or actually falls.
The necessary and sufficient condition for r to fall (controlling for terms of trade effects), is that the
ratio of cost-savings exceeds the ratio of L-input coefficients, SX/SY > aLX/aLY. If the cost-savings ratio
lies between the capital and labour ratios, then both wages may rise (an ‘anti-Stolper-Samuelson’
effect). Figure 1 illustrates the possibilities. The usual Jonesian magnification effects are in operation.

Figure 1: Shadow-migration, cost-savings, and offshoring’s production and wage effects
Apart from possible terms-of-trade effects, there is no change in the foreign wages as Foreign goods
are produced with the unchanged Foreign technology.11 To summarise:

Proposition 3:
Offshoring raises the real wage of Home L-workers if the offshoring implies cost
savings that are sufficiently larger in the L-intensive sector than in the K-intensive sector; the
real wage of K-workers rises less or actually falls; it falls if the cost-savings are sufficiently
skewed towards the L-intensive sector. The precise necessary and sufficient conditions are
illustrated in Figure 1. Apart from terms of trade effects, wages of Foreign L- and K-workers
are unaffected.
Notice that shadow migration can widen or narrow the international wage gap for each type of labour,
so offshoring may increase or decrease the pressure for real migration. In this sense, shadow migration
need not be a substitute for real migration.
Rent allocation. The cost savings arises from the use of Home’s superior technology with Foreign’s
cheap labour. This creates rents (Foreign workers in the offshoring sector are paid their reservation
wage rather than their marginal product) that accrue entirely to Home in the services-version of our
offshoring model. The sectoral bias in the cost-savings determines how much of these rents go to
Home L-workers as opposed to Home K-workers. This can be seen explicitly by writing (17) in terms
of the Home-Foreign wage gaps using the definitions of the S’s in (14):

11

If offshoring involves a relatively large amount of shadow L-migration versus shadow K-migration, the price of the Lintensive goods will fall, as per (15); this implies a negative terms of trade effect for Foreign, so Foreign L-workers would
lose and Foreign K-workers would gain according to standard Stolper-Samuelson reasoning.

11

Baldwin & Robert-Nicoud: Offshoring: General Equilibrium effects

Using the definitions of SX and SY, this shows that the division of rents between Home L- and Kworkers depends upon the relative labour savings in the X and Y sectors.
Extreme offshoring. One interesting special case is where the coordination costs for all tasks are
zero (all χ’s are unity). In this case, all tasks are offshored and Home’s superior technology completely
displaces Foreign technology (all Foreign labourers work in the offshoring sector). The outcome is
exactly like a technology transfer from Home to Foreign that brings the Foreign economy to the
technology frontier. In this extreme case, Home wages are unchanged (controlling for terms of trade
effects) but Foreign wages rise to Home levels. This tells us that the wage-offshoring relationship is
thus non-monotonic. A modest lowering of coordination costs produces offshoring that raises
advanced-nation real incomes (as per Proposition 1), but a very large reduction could return them to
the pre-offshoring level, while raising the backward nation’s factor prices to those of the advanced
nation.
Inter-industry and intra-industry trade effects. Since offshoring changes the Home technology
matrix but does not affect Foreign’s, we can no longer transform the equilibrium into free trade among
nations with identical technology using the effective labour concept. This means that much of the
elegance of the HO trade equation (7) disappears with offshoring, except in special cases. In particular,
Home firms face the technology matrix A-A1 while Foreign firms continue to face γA.
Home imports of X are (1-α) times its GDP minus its production of X. In the offshoring equilibrium,
MXO=(1-α)EO-XO, so we can express the change in imports in terms of the change in Home’s GDP and
its production of X, i.e. M XO − M X = (1 − α ) ∆E − ∆X . Since offshoring’s impact on E is driven by
factor price changes – and thus SX and SY as per (17) – while its impact on X is driven by ∆L and ∆K as
per (16), offshoring changes the pattern of trade in final goods (apart from knife-edge cases). For
example, if the shadow migration is heavily biased towards K (so the impact on X is negative) and the
per-unit cost-saving is heavily biased towards Y (so the wage of Home’s abundant factor rises) then
Home’s imports of X will rise. More precisely, we calculate ∆E (which equals L∆w+ K∆r) from (17)
and ∆X from (16) to get:

(19)

Plainly this depends upon the sectoral cost-saving (the S’s) and shadow migration, ∆K and ∆L, in
complex ways. Thus, except in knife-edge cases offshoring alters the pattern of trade in final goods. To
summarise:

Proposition 4:
Offshoring is a ‘source of comparative advantage’ in that it alters the pattern of
trade in final goods. For instance, if Home and Foreign have identical endowments ratios
there would be no HO motive for trade without offshoring, but trade in final goods can
arises due to the ‘shadow migration’ associated with offshoring.
Intra-industry trade arises with offshoring if statisticians classify the output of tasks X1 and Y1 as Xsector and Y-sector trade respectively. Home imports the fruit of tasks X1 and Y1. Since Home also
imports either X or Y final goods (except in knife-edge cases), intra-industry trade must arise. To
summarise:

Proposition 5:
Offshoring typically creates intra-industry trade since Home imports the fruit of
the offshored task X1 and Y1 and is, typically, a net exporter of either X or Y even if Home
and Foreign have identical factor endowments.

12

A standard measure of the volume of intra-industry trade is the ‘overlap’ of a country’s import and
exports within a given sector. Denoting ‘IIT’ as our measure of intra-industry trade and writing

3.2. Trade in tasks and the 4 theorems
The effective Factor Price Equalisation theorem described above involved a pre- and post-trade
comparison of wages in the absence of offshoring. Offshoring, in general, breaks the effective factor
price equalisation since it changes Home wages. In other words, if a nation engaged in offshoring but
the econometrician ignored it, a test of the effective factor price equalisation theorem would fail.
Moreover, it would be easy to confuse the direction of causality. Offshoring creates extra trade and it
widens the international wage gap (for at least one type of labour and possibly both as per Proposition
1). Thus, empirical researchers might mistakenly attribute the gap-widening to the extra trade while in
truth the two were created by a third cause – the technology-transfer embodied in offshoring.
The Heckscher-Ohlin theorem links trade in goods to relative factor endowments. The HeckscherOhlin theorem does not necessarily hold when there is free trade and offshoring. For instance, if
nations have identical factor endowment ratios, free trade and offshoring would result in inter-industry
trade when the HO theorem would predict none. If the econometrician tested the HO theorem ignoring
offshoring, the data might contradict the sign predictions of the HO theorem (the labour abundant
nation might export the K-intensive good on net as per Proposition 4, a Leontief-like paradox). If the
econometrician used sector average factor intensities (e.g. aLX and aKX) to evaluate the factor content of
the trade in tasks X1 and Y1 as well as the trade in final goods, the volume predictions of the HO
theorem would be violated even if the sign predictions were correct. Depending upon the factor
intensity of the offshored tasks, the data might be marked by a ‘missing trade’ paradox, i.e. show less
net trade than predicted by the HO theorem, but equally well there might be too much net trade.
The correct version of the HO theorem in our model is rather involved. Since Home GDP is
X O + pOYO − wO* ∆L − rO* ∆K , namely the output of final goods less the cost of imported intermediates,
we can use the manipulations leading to (7) to write Home imports of X as:
M XO =

α LO kO − kɶOw
(
) − (1 − α )( w *O ∆L + r *O ∆K )
aLX kɶOw − κ X

The first term is isomorphic to the standard HO theorem formulation as in (7), except we use the
shadow rather than the actual relative endowments (in effective units). The second term is proportional
to two endogenous quantities that might be observable – the total wage bill in the offshoring sector in
Foreign, and the value of Home’s imports of intermediates (all in terms of the numeraire). The closed
form solution for (1 − α )( w* ∆L + r* ∆K ) , employing the definitions of ∆K and ∆L, (17) and (16), is:

Baldwin & Robert-Nicoud: Offshoring: General Equilibrium effects

where pO is defined in (15). Plainly this is far more complex that the usual HO theorem. The reason is
that offshoring alters the relative technology matrices in ways that prevent us from using the effectivelabour concept to cleanly restate the equilibrium as trade between nations with identical technology.
The Stolper-Samuelson theorem is a partial equilibrium result linking factor and goods prices. In the
partial equilibrium spirit, we take the extent of offshoring – as measured by SX and SY – to be
exogenous when formulating the equivalent theorem for the case of free trade in tasks and goods.
Inspection of (17) shows that the theorem would be unaltered for Foreign, but the transmission of
changes in p to Home w and r is altered by the SX and SY terms. Using (17), the theorem’s analogue in
our model is:
dwO / wO

aKY /aKX − pO wO

drO / rO

=

r
( )
− aLY /aLX rO

(22)

Comparing this to (8), we see that the impact on w would be dampened (less negative) and the impact
on r would be magnified (more positive), if and only if wO rises and rO falls with offshoring
(controlling for terms of trade effects). As we know from the discussion above, a necessary condition
for this to be the case is that the relative cost saving is skewed towards the L-intensive sector so that
S X / SY > aLX / aLY , as per Figure 1.
The Rybczynski theorem analogue with trade in tasks is (taking the extent of shadow migration as
given):

(23)
where kO ≡ (K+∆K)/(L+∆L). Comparison of this and (9) provides two main results. First, under the
assumption that offshoring does not reverse the ranking of relative factor intensities, the proportional
increase in X from a given proportional increase in L would be smaller under trade in goods only, but
the drop in Y production would be more marked, if and only if XO > X and YO < Y; for these conditions
to hold, it is sufficient that κ X > ∆K / ∆L . If ∆K / ∆L > κ Y , then the proportional increase in X is more
marked and the proportional drop of Y would be dampened. Second, if as a result of offshoring X
becomes capital intensive, then the output of X decreases as a result of an increase in L by the usual
Rybczynski logic. To summarise:

Proposition 6:
Offshoring alters the four HO theorems. An econometrician who tested the HO
theorem’s sign and volume predictions ignoring offshoring would reject the theorem even
though a modified form the HO theorem holds. The same can be said for the factor price
equalisation theorem since the extra trade induced by offshoring tends to widen international
factor price gaps. The Stolper-Samuelson and Rybczynski theorems would also appear to be
rejected in their strict forms although properly modified versions of the theorems hold.
3.3. Integrating special cases in the literature
The fragmentation/offshoring literature has focused on special cases. Many of the papers assume that
offshoring occurs in only a single sector while others present cases where offshoring only involves a
single factor. Here we illustrate how our offshoring model can integrate the various cases. To keep our
synthesis manageable, we limit our focus to Home wage effects and ignore terms of trade effects.
From (17):

∆w =

aKY S X − aKX SY
,
det( A)

∆r =

aLX SY − aLY S X
det( A)

(24)

14

Baldwin & Robert-Nicoud: Offshoring: General Equilibrium effects

In the papers that assume only one sector experiences fragmented/offshoring (so SX or SY is zero),
offshoring that acts like sector-specific Home technical progress, so the wage changes (ignoring terms
of trade effects) are simple and “Jones ambiguity” (see Introduction) arises. If
offshoring/fragmentation occurs only in the unskilled-labour intensive X-sector, SY = 0 and Home
unskilled wages rise, but w falls if offshoring occurs only in the Y-sector. Likewise, r rises and w falls
if the offshoring occurs only in the skilled labour intensive sector.
In papers where offshoring involves only one factor, e.g. GRH (2006a), offshoring acts like a factorspecific cost savings and the well-known GRH result that offshoring unambiguous boosts the wage of
workers’ whose jobs are offshored (controlling for terms of trade effects) can arise. GRH (2006a)
assume production functions where each task uses only L-labour or only K-labour and they undertake
most of the analysis assuming that only L-tasks are offshored.12 In this case, S X = aLX 1 ( wO − wO* ) and

SY = aLY 1 ( wO − wO* ) , so:
∆w =

aKY aLX 1 − aKX aLY 1
( wO − wO* ) ,
det( A)

∆r =

( aLY 1/aLY ) − ( aLX 1/aLX )
aLY aLX ( wO − wO* )
det( A )

(25)

Due to GRH normalisations involving the size of tasks and the equality of offshoring costs across
sectors, the numerator of ∆r is zero, while ∆w is positive.13 GRH (2006b) also consider the case where
tasks that involve only K-labour can also be offshored and this case SX and SY regain their general
formulation as in (14), so the Jones ambiguity is restored as per Proposition 3.

4. MANUFACTURING TASK OFFSHORING
In the previous section, all output of the offshored sector was sold to Home even though offshored
production units produce tasks X1 and Y1 at a lower cost than the Foreign producers. Here we allow
local sales of X1 and Y1. For the sake of terminological clarity, we refer to this case (where the ζ’s are
zero) as the ‘manufacturing goods case’ even though it could apply to some types of services.
When inter-firm coordination costs ζ(X1) and ζ(X1) are zero, the offshoring Home firms would also
supply X1 and Y1 to Foreign producers. This would change the pricing and employment equations to:

GRH (2006a) focuses exclusively on the case where only tasks involving L can be offshored; GRH (2006b) also
considers the possibility that tasks involving K can be also be offshored. The main restriction in their formal analysis in
both papers is that every task is performed only by L or only by K.
13

GRH (2006b) normalize the measure of a task so that L-tasks in both industries all have the same unit input coefficients,
i.e. aLX1 = aLY1, in our notation. They also assume that the offshoring cost for the tasks that have been thus normalised are
identical across sectors (i.e. tx(i) = ty(i) = t(i) in their notation). This interaction between the normalisation of task ‘sizes’
(formally, their measure) within each sector and the cross-sector assumption on offshoring costs implies that the labour
cost-saving in both sectors is proportional to the pre-offshoring unit-labour input coefficient, which, in our notation implies
aLX1/aLX = aLY1/aLY. Footnote 12 in GRH (2006b) suggests that aLX1 = aLY1 could be relaxed by allowing more general
substitution among tasks but the mapping to offshoring costs in this a case is not made explicit.

where ∆p denotes pO – p as before. Two aspects of this expression are noteworthy. First, the expression
for Home factor prices is isomorphic to (17) so our analysis in the service-offshoring case in the
previous section also applies in this model extension (although the exact value of SX and SY may
change since the Foreign factor prices can be different). Second, the wages of Foreign workers also
benefit from the cost-savings induced by the offshoring-linked technology transfer (the exact persector cost saving is given by S *X and SY* ).14 Moreover, the form of the Foreign wage changes in (27)
are isomorphic to those of Home. Consequently, all the detailed analysis in the previous section
relating the cost-savings to the wage effects (e.g. Proposition 3 and Figure 1) is applicable to the
impact of offshoring on Foreign wages with S *X and SY* substituted for SX and SY.

Qualitatively, the impact on Home production is the same as in the service-offshoring case in the
previous section. The impact on Foreign production, however, is qualitatively different and the shadow
migration interpretation is less clear-cut (note in particular that the sign of ∆L* and ∆K* is now
ambiguous, though effective world endowments of L and K are unambiguously larger with offshoring,
i.e. LɶwO > Lɶw and Kɶ Ow > Kɶ w . In the service-offshoring case, Home offshored technology was used only
for Home production, so the Foreign labour employed in the offshoring sector was diverted from
Foreign production and this meant that the Foreign production change was proportional to the Home
production effect but of the opposite sign (e.g. ∆X = -∆X*/γ). Here the tech-transfer embodied in
offshoring tends to stimulate Foreign production, so this simple proportionality breaks down.
Nevertheless, the basic analysis of production effects for Foreign follows the Proposition 2 and Figure
1 reasoning (held for Home) with ∆X* and ∆Y* substituted for ∆X and ∆Y.
Since the trade effects follow from the production and factor price changes, as per the reason
surrounding Proposition 4 and 5, it is clear that offshoring in the goods-case at hand will also be a
source of comparative advantage and intra-industry trade.

5. EXTENDING THE BASIC MODEL
In this section, we extend the basic trade-in-tasks model in two directions. First, we allow for
Ricardian differences among nations and show that this can result in the two-way offshoring that is
common among OECD nations (Amiti and Wei 2005). Second, we show that the basic analysis in
Section 3 goes through in a simple Helpman-Krugman trade model. This may be useful since some of
the coordination-cost assumptions in our offshoring model fit more naturally in setting where firms
produce differentiated product (and thus naturally have differentiated inputs).

14

There is a crucial difference, though, between the factor price effects on Home versus Foreign labour. For Home labour,
it is rents that generates the cost-savings (i.e. the fact that Foreign workers are paid less than their marginal products); for
Foreign labour, technology transfer is the source of the cost-savings.

16

Baldwin & Robert-Nicoud: Offshoring: General Equilibrium effects

5.1. Intra-industry two-way offshoring 15
To focus on the essential differences between trade in goods and tasks, it proved convenient to
eliminate Ricardian motives for trade by assuming that the international technology differences were
of the Hicks neutral type. One result of this assumption was that Foreign never offshored tasks to
Home. The extensive empirical literature on fragmentation, however, documents the importance of
two-way offshoring. Here we modify the basic model in a way that creates two-way, intra-industry
offshoring in spirit akin to Davis (1995). We shall do so in a highly specific model. As the analysis
above made clear, there are a wealth of cases that could be considered (e.g. various combinations of
factor abundance and technology superiority, factor intensity of the offshored tasks, etc.). However it
is not really necessary to formally consider all the cases. Most of the cases can be dealt with simply
using the core intuition that trade in tasks can be viewed as ‘shadow migration’.
We assume ‘mirror image’ Ricardian superiority. Home has inferior technology in tasks X3 and Y3,
while Foreign has inferior technology in tasks X1 and Y1. The nations have identical technology in
tasks X2 and X3. Moreover, we assume that the task-level technological advantages exactly offset each
other so that the two nations have the same sector-level unit input coefficients. Formally, let the inputoutput matrices be B≡{bij} and B*≡{bij*}, i = L,K and j = X,Y. We assume that the technological edges
in tasks 1 and 3 are such that:
bij ≡ aij1 + aij 2 + γ 3 aij 3 , bij* ≡ γ 1aij1 + aij 2 + aij 3 , bij = bij* , γ h > 1;

i = K , L,

j = X , Y , h = 1,3

so B*=B. Finally, we assume nations have the same factor endowment ratios.
Given the analysis above, the outcome without offshoring (i.e. trade in tasks) is obvious. The two
nations have identical wages and do not trade with each other, i.e.:

1
T  w
T  w *

 K  = B  Y  = B  Y *  =  K*
 
 
   

(29)

Once we allow free offshoring – i.e. the coordination costs, the χ’s and the ζ’s, drop to unity – trade in
tasks occurs. Specifically, Home’s superior technology in tasks X1 and Y1 completely displaces
Foreign’s technology in these tasks while Foreign’s superior technology in tasks X3 and Y3 completely
displaces Home’s technology. In this case, the offshoring (and the fact that tasks can be sold at arm’s
length among firms since the ζ’s are unity) imply that both nations move to the technology frontier. As
a result, the pricing and production equations are:

where the subscript ‘O’ indicates two-way offshoring equilibrium variables (i.e. we have ‘reset’ the
notation so these endogenous variables differ from those in previous sections). Since B>A (i.e. each bij
is larger than the corresponding aij), it is immediate from (29) and (30) that, first, the real reward of at
least one factor of production has risen and, second, (world and domestic) production of at least one of
the two final goods has risen. In symbols:

Baldwin & Robert-Nicoud: Offshoring: General Equilibrium effects

The production effects are simple to work out. The two-way offshoring is like ‘shadow migration’ but
due to the symmetry we imposed, there is no net shadow migration, so there is no Rybczynski effect in
either nation. By contrast, the move of both nations towards the technology frontier as a result of twoway offshoring will be isomorphic to a labour saving productivity improvement in both sectors in both
nations. Given the ex ante symmetry of the nations at the sector level and the ex post symmetry of the
nations at the task level, there is no trade in final goods either before or after free offshoring. With
offshoring, all trade is intra-industry trade in tasks. If the tasks represent manufacturing stages, this
would be parts and components trade. If they are service inputs, this would be intra-industry services
trade.16

5.2. Offshoring in a Helpman-Krugman trade model
A fact that has been well appreciated in the literature since Norman (1976) and Helpman and Krugman
(1985) is that the basic HO results carry through unaltered in a Dixit-Stiglitz monopolistic competition
setting provided that technologies are homothetic.17 Here we use this insight to show that the Section 3
analysis could easily be conducted in a monopolistic competition trade model setting. Such a setting
has the merit of making firm-level variables better defined but the demerit of reducing comparability
with the classic HO model.
The key to the Section 3 analysis lies in the pricing and employment equations and their restatement
using the shadow migration insight. As is well known, the free-entry output of a typical variety under
monopolistic competition (MC) with homothetic technologies, is parametrically fixed at F(σ-1), where
F is the fixed entry cost and σ is the elasticity of substitution.18 This implies that MC sectors display
constant returns at the sector level (doubling sectoral output at equilibrium would require double the
inputs). Equally well-known is Dixit-Stiglitz MC’s constant mark-up pricing which makes prices
proportional to marginal costs. These two facts imply that the MC pricing and employment equations
differ only slightly from those of the HO model in Section 2. Specifically, assuming Dixit-Stiglitz
competition in both sectors, the Home employment and pricing conditions are:19

L
X 
σ
 K  = ( σ − 1) A  Y  ,
 
 

1 
σ
T  w
 p  = ( σ − 1) A  r 
 
 

(31)

The Foreign pricing and employment conditions are isomorphic.
Since we have not specified units of X, Y, L or K, we are free to now choose units such that the
coefficient, σ/(σ-1), is absorbed into the definitions of prices and endowments. With this, we have
reduced the problem to the problem solved in Sections 3 (service-task case) and so can conclude that
Propositions 1 to 6 also hold in this model.

6. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Our paper presents a simple model of offshoring that allows us to derive necessary and sufficient
conditions are wage, production and trade effects of offshoring. The simplicity also allows us to re16

This is consistent with the evidence in Schott (2004) insofar as we observe two-way trade at finely disaggregated levels
and that the differences in productivity at the task level are re-interpreted as differences in the quality of the fruit of the
task.
17

A ‘bundle’ of i-sector factors uses aLi and aKi units of L and K, respectively. The fixed cost involves F bundles and the
marginal cost involves 1 bundle in each sector i = X,Y.
Let x denote output and v denote marginal cost. Free entry requires that the price, which is vσ/(σ-1), equals average cost,
which equals v(1+F/x), solving for x yields the result in the text.
18

19

The equilibrium output per firm in both sectors is F(σ-1), so the per-firm demand for factor bundles (including the
demand for the fixed cost) is x = Fσ. Since X-sector output is just nx where n is the mass of X-firms, n = X/F(σ-1), total Xsector labour demand is a aLX(F+x)n, which equals aLX(σ/(σ-1))X. Similar expressions hold for the other labour demands.

formula the four classic HO theorems to account for trade in tasks (offshoring) as well as trade in
goods. Our results can also be used to integrate the complex gallery of results derived in the extensive
theoretical literature on offshoring/fragmentation. The key is that we view offshoring as ‘shadow
migration’ that brings with it cost-savings that act as technological changes. This permits us to use the
elegant analysis of Jones (1965). The paper also shows that the basic model can easily be extended to
account for two-way offshoring between similar nations. To bolster comparability between our results
with offshoring and the four classic HO theorems, the bulk of our analysis is in a Walrasian setting, but
we show that it applies equally in a simple monopolistic competition setting.

APPENDIX: CLOSED FORM SOLUTIONS WITH OFFSHORING
The closed-form solutions for wages and production with service offshoring are simple to derive but
tend to be too complex to be revealing, so the text works with aggregates of parameters that are reflect
to potentially observable quantities – SX, SY, ∆L, and ∆K. Here we provide the closed-form solutions in
matrix notation. These all follow from straightforward manipulation of (12) and the definitions of SX,
SY, ∆L, and ∆K. Foreign wages and Home production are simple to calculate since there is no
interaction with the other pricing and employment equations:
