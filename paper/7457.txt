ABSTRACT
In this paper we provide an analytical review of previous estimates of the rate of return on
schooling investments and measure how these estimates vary by country, over time, and by estimation
method. We find evidence reporting (or “file drawer”) bias in the estimates and, after due account
is taken of this bias, we find that differences due to estimation method are much smaller than is
sometimes reported, although some are statistically significant. We also find that estimated returns
are higher in the U.S. and they have increased in the last two decades.

1. Introduction
In recent years there has been considerable interest in whether measured correlations between
schooling and earnings reflect the causal impact of schooling on earnings. This interest has led to
some innovative methods of estimation that take advantage of either exogenous determinants of
schooling decisions (instrumental variables) or comparisons between genetically identical
workers (twins). In this paper we provide an analytical survey of estimates of the rate of return to
schooling that is designed to determine the extent to which rates of return differ by country, over
time, and with the method of estimation.
In providing this surve y we have taken especial care to study the role that “reporting” or
“file drawer” bias may have played in the studies we observe. Reporting bias may arise because
of the tendency in virtually all scientific fields to report statistical results that tend to reject the
hypothesis of no effect. The result is that estimated effects of schooling may be correlated with
sampling errors and, if these are in turn correlated with other variables, conclusions about the
determinants of rates of return may be seriously biased. The existence of any such bias is no
reflection on any individual scholar, but is instead the natural working of a scientific process
designed to discover important new results. We implement a generalized method for testing for
reporting bias, and for adjusting reported estimates for reporting bias, that is due to Hedges
(1992).
The results of our study provide some evidence that estimated rates of return do suffer
from reporting bias, especially those based on instrumental variables or within-twin estimators.
After adjustment for reporting bias we find strong evidence of a considerable payoff to schooling
that differs less with the estimation method used to measure that payoff than is sometimes
reported.

2. Simple Earnings Functions & the Problems of OLS-Estimation
Ignoring other covariates, Mincer’s (1974) specification for the determinants of earnings is
y i = α + βS i + u i

(1)

where yi is the log of earnings of individual i, Si is a measure of their schooling, ui is a statistical
error term and α and β are parameters to be estimated, with the parameter β being the return to
schooling.

In the early literature following Mincer's approach, equation (1) - extended with

linear and quadratic experience terms to account for on-the-job training - was commonly
estimated by means of ordinary least squares (OLS). This estimation technique assumes that the
explanatory variables are uncorrelated with the unobserved disturbance in the equation, which for
various reasons might not be fulfilled.
The coefficient β is biased if an individual’s ‘ability’ or motivation affects earnings but is
omitted from the earnings equation, with the extent of the bias determined by the correlation
between education and ability. The concern about the formulation of an estimate of the return to
schooling β is that ability may be associated with both wages and schooling. Three approaches
have been used to try to deal with this potential problem. One approach deals with the issue of
ability bias by including explicit measures that proxy for unobserved ability. IQ and related tests
are an example of such proxies (Griliches (1977), Griliches and Mason (1972)). The results of
these studies have sometimes suggested that there is an upward bias in results that lack an ability
measure.

The method of adding ability proxies has been criticised, however, because it is

extremely difficult to develop ability measures that are not themselves determined by schooling.
When the ability measure is itself influenced by schooling, the use of ability proxies will, in fact,
bias estimated rates of return downward.

3

The ‘siblings’ or ‘twins’ approach exploits a belief that siblings are more alike then a
randomly selected pair of individuals, given that they share common heredity, financial support,
peer influences, and geographic influences. The approach attempts to eliminate omitted ability
bias by estimating the return to schooling from differences between siblings or twins in levels of
schooling and earnings. If the omitted variable, say ability (A), is such that siblings have the same
level of A, then any estimate of β from within family data will eliminate this bias.
Studies based on sibling or twin comparisons have suffered from two primary criticisms.
First, if ability has an individual component as well as a family component, which is not
independent of the schooling variable, the within-family approach may not yield estimates that
are less biased than OLS estimates. Second, if schooling is measured with error, this will account
for a larger fraction of the differences between the twins than across the population as a whole.
This would imply that the bias from measurement error in schooling is likely to increase by
forming differences between twins, which means the within-twin estimates will be biased
downwards. Recent contributions to the twins and siblings literature have attempted to deal with
the measurement error problem by collecting multiple measures of schooling by questioning the
siblings about each other or by using independent measures of error variances to adjust the
estimates. Many of the within-twin studies suggest that ability bias is relatively small, although
this is only the case when measurement error has been controlled.
A third approach to the problem of ability bias exploits natural variation in data caused by
different influences on the schooling decision. The essence of this 'natural experiment' approach
is to provide a suitable determinant (or instrument) for schooling that is not correlated with the
earnings residual.

In principle, natural experiments provide the closest equivalent to a

randomised trial in a clinical study. In the context presented here the treatment group is chosen
4

(albeit not randomly) independent of individual characteristics. The treatment and control groups
should, in principle, be identical in other observed and unobserved characteristics that affect
earnings except for schooling. By constructing instruments for schooling that are uncorrelated
with the earnings residual the instrumental variables (IV) approach will generate a consistent
estimator of the return to schooling. The basic idea of the IV estimator is to proceed in two
stages. First, estimate the effect of the instrumental variable on schooling; then estimate the
effect of the instrumental variable on earnings. Since, by assumption, the instrument is correlated
with earnings only because it influences schooling, the ratio of the effect of the instrument on
earnings to its effect on schooling provides an estimate of the causal effect of schooling on
earnings. The primary criticism of IV estimates revolves around the concern that the instrument
may not, in fact, be truly independent of the earnings residual. If, for example, the instrument is
positively correlated with earnings, the IV estimator may be upward biased.
The results from IV studies are varied, but some point towards the presence of a
downward bias in OLS estimates. Card (1998) has proposed an explanation for this phenomenon
that is based on the hypothesis that the return to schooling is heterogeneous and declines at higher
levels of schooling. IV estimates will differ from OLS estimates to the extent that the instrument
influences schooling decisions at different levels. If the instrument influences decisions primarily
at lower levels of schooling, the IV estimator may be higher than the OLS estimator because it
reflects the payoff to schooling at lower rather than higher schooling levels.
It is apparent from this discussion that the estimates of returns to schooling may differ
because of the estimation method. In what follows we systematically investigate the role of the
estimation method - along with region and time period - as determinants of the payoff to
schooling.
5

3. Meta-Analysis of the Returns to Schooling Literature
There already exist several extensive summaries of the payoff to schooling, including
Psacharopolous (1994) and Card (1998). Here we use methods common among statisticians, and
sometimes called “meta-analysis,” to test whether estimated payoffs are sensitive to estimation
period or time period covered and to provide a framework to determine whether our inferences
are sensitive to reporting (or “file drawer”) bias. As noted in Huque (1988), Hunter et al.(1990)
and Egger and Smith (1997) a meta-analysis combines and integrates the results of several
studies that share a common aspect so as to be 'combinable' in a statistical manner.
Although less common in economics 1 , there has been considerable concern in the medical
and statistical literature over whether the observed sample of published results was selected
solely because they were "statistically significant". If they were, then any survey of these results
suffers from the sample selection bias so well known in a different context in econometric
analyses. In what follows we provide estimates of the extent of this kind of selection bias and
also of its effect on estimates of the factors associated with differences across time, across
econometric methods, and across regions in the return to schooling. We test for publication bias
using a method due to Hedges (1992) that we have generalized to accommodate systematic
heterogeneity in the payoff to education.
It is important to understand that “reporting bias” may exist even without the authors of
individual studies being aware of it. The potential problem simply arises because of the desire to
report useful findings. Except in unusual circumstances, evidence against the null hypothesis—

Similar issues have been addressed extensively by financial economists; see Brown, Goetzmann, and Ross (1995)
and Lo and MacKinlay (1990). Card and Krueger (1995) also comment on this problem in their survey of minimum
wage studies.

that is, favorable to the finding of a treatment effect—is more valuable and more likely to be
reported in any rational weighting of the usefulness of empirical evidence.

For our analysis we created a data set of 96 different returns to schooling, obtained from
27 studies. Table 1 reports some descriptive statistics for this sample of both published and
unpublished studies, broken down by estimation method, with the full listing of the studies
reported in Appendix Table A1. 2 The year of estimation averages in the mid-80's but ranges
from 1974 to 1995. Sample size is quite varied with the smallest sample naturally being observed
in the twins’ studies. Ability controls are quite common in the literature, with around 20% of the
OLS estimated sample containing ability measures, and a somewhat higher representation in the
IV estimated returns. Explicit control for the presence of measurement error is increasingly a
feature of the literature and we see an average of 6% of the rates of return coming from models
where this is the case, although control for measurement error is far more common in the twins

7

studies. With respect to the returns and their corresponding standard errors/t-statistics we see the
pattern emerging clearly - average returns of 6/7% with corresponding IV and twins study
estimated returns of 9%. Precision is lost when we move from OLS however, as seen in the far
larger standard errors among the IV and twins studies.

The criteria for study inclusion are not very stringent. The starting point was the list originally produced by
David Card (1998), reported in Appendix Table A1 and the comprehensive review of Cohn and Addison (1997)
where the details about the original data were provided. The deadline for entries in this study is June 1998.

The top half of Table 2 provides some regression results whereby the estimated return is
related to a range of other variables that may influence the estimated return. The omitted category
is important to note - here we use an unpublished return estimated via OLS without ability or
measurement error corrections as our specification. The year variable is re-scaled so that 1974=0,
so that the constant in the regression measures the rate of return in 1974. For results pooled
across countries the omitted category is the US. The dependent variable is the level of the
estimated return.

The pooled results suggest little difference in the estimated returns by

geographical region - countries in this non-US grouping include Finland, Honduras, Indonesia,
Ireland, Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom. Estimation methods have significant
effects throughout with rates of return by IV and fixed effects/twins some 3% and 1.6% higher
than the OLS default category. Sample size in itself has no effect on the estimated return but
controlling for ability lowers the OLS estimate for the US studies in line with conventional
wisdom, but raises the OLS estimate in the non-US studies. Controlling for measurement error
has no significant effect on estimated rates of return, but published papers do tend to report
higher rates of return (although this is only significant for the non-US studies). Looking at the
results for the US we see that the more recent estimates are higher for the US studies in line with
recent suggestions of a general shift upwards in the returns to schooling in the US. However this
result is not apparent for the non-US studies, confirming the findings of Harmon and Walker
(1995) of a relatively stable pattern of returns over time in the UK, which would be the largest
grouping in the non-US block.
The bottom half of Table 2 incorporates all of the earlier elements but in addition controls
explicitly for the standard error of the regression coefficient estimated for the rate of return in the
model. The results here are rather startling. Unlike the top half of the table we no longer find
any evidence of differences in the returns estimated by different estimation procedures, nor do we
9

observe the pattern of higher estimates in published studies (although the upward drift of returns
over time is still observed). This is a very important result, for in the absence of any bias in the
reporting of results the estimates should not be correlated with the standard error. This leads us in
the next section to a more formal consideration of the results in the context of reporting bias.

4.

Model of Reporting Bias

One straightforward interpretation of the contrast between the result in panels A and B in Table 2
is that estimated payoffs that are significantly different from zero are more likely to be reported
in journals and, since the twins studies and IV studies tend to have larger sampling errors in
general, a less representative sample of these studies is typically reported.
The graphs in Figure 1 examine this issue more closely and are related to the material
presented in Table 2 where we related the return to schooling to the estimated standard error.
These graphs show a plot of the estimated return against the standard error, together with the
estimated regression line. In the absence of any selective reporting this line should be horizontal,
as the return to schooling should not vary in proportion to its standard error. However if the
tendency is to only report where the t-ratio is greater than 2 the estimated return will increase as
the standard error increase in order to maintain the t-ratio at or above 2. Over all of the estimates
in our meta-analysis, shown in panel (a) we find a positive slope which is significant (t = 7.11)
but in the case of the OLS returns in panel (b) the slightly positive slope is not statistically
significant. However the estimated returns in panel (c) and (d) for the IV and Twins estimates
respectively show far steeper slopes which are statistically significant (with estimated t-ratios of
3.92 and 5.42 respectively).

An alternative way to consider this problem is to estimate the study returns from the
information collected via a simple meta regression.

We might expect some degree of

heterogeneity in the returns compared to some overall pooled 'average' return if what we are
seeing in the reported studies is not exhibiting some degree of non-randomness. The graphs in
Figure 2 represent pooled meta-analysis estimates of the returns based on the relationship
between the estimate and the standard error of the estimate. Note that in the case of the OLS
estimates the pooled estimate (represented in the graph by the vertical line) bypasses many of the
individual interval estimates. On the contrary the results for the IV and Twins estimates suggest
a clustering of the results around the pooled estimate in almost every instance.
Hedges (1992), in a review of over seven hundred studies on the effectiveness of aptitude
tests as a predictor of employment outcomes, proposes a formal model of publication bias based
on the assumption that there is a weight function (based on outcome p-values) that determines the
probability a study is observed. Full details of this weight function are outlined in an appendix to
this paper but the estimation procedure generates parameters that determine the increasing or
decreasing probability of observing a study.

We have specified different probabilities of

observation of a study according to whether the p-value for that study is 0.01<p<0.05 (denoted
ω2 ) or p>0.05 (denoted ω3 ), relative to a default category of 0<p<0.01. This default category’s
weight ω1 is normalized to unity expressing the assumption that results with p-values in this
bracket are reported with probability one. In the absence of reporting bias ω2 and ω3 should equal
unity as well, indicating the equality of outcome probabilities when significance of results is

11

accounted for. In addition to these ωi parameters the overall pooled estimate for the return to
schooling, denoted ∆, is provided based on the observed studies. Finally, the heterogeneity
(measured by the standard deviation) in rates of return is estimated, and denoted σ.

Table 3 presents the results for all studies together, for the studies using OLS and for the
IV-studies, based on the modified Hedges' procedure. The first column gives the results of the
full model, while the results in the second column are based on the model assuming no
publication bias. The presence of publication bias is determined by examining the parameters ωi
12

and testing the restriction of ω2 = ω3 = 1. Rejection of this restriction indicates the presence of
publication bias. The test statistic is the difference of the log-likelihood values of the two models
times 2. This statistic has a chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. Hence for the
OLS studies equality of ω2 and ω3 to unity cannot be rejected, while for the IV studies equality of
ω2 and ω3 to unity has to be rejected at the 1% level (test statistic equals 9.82 with a critical value
of 9.21). Thus the IV studies appear to exhibit publication bias.
The parameter ∆ in this context can be interpreted as the true mean effect corrected for
publication bias. Correcting for this bias the IV estimated rate of return to a year of schooling is
equal to 0.081, higher than the OLS rate of return of 0.064. There is evidence of considerable
heterogeneity in estimated returns, with an estimated standard deviation of around .03. Notice
also that the corrected IV return is somewhat below the uncorrected IV return (0.081 vs. 0.086).
The point estimates for ω2 exceed 1 so it is expected that studies with p-values below 0.01 have a
lower probability to be observed than studies with a p-values between 0.01 and 0.05, but these
estimates are never significantly higher than one. On the other hand, the probability of observing
a study with a p-value numerically larger than 0.05 is much smaller than that of observing a pvalue smaller than 0.01, and this difference is statistically significant (Hedges found a similar
pattern).
The interpretation of ∆ as the true mean effect corrected for publication bias (with only
random heterogeneity) is a sensible interpretation in applications where it is indeed reasonable to
expect that there is one uniform global effect. With medical interventions this might indeed be
the case. When returns to schooling are considered, however, we have presented evidence that the
returns vary across, for instance, countries and periods.

A natural extension of Hedges'

likelihood function is to parameterize ∆, thereby allowing the true return to schooling to vary
13

with some of these characteristics. Thus the restriction, present in Table 3, that the estimate of
the true rate of return is a constant is removed which allows us to show how the 'reporting-biascorrected' return to schooling varies with the studies' characteristics.
In Table 4 we supplement the parameter ∆ with interactions between it and the various
regressors in Table 2, thus combining the OLS regressions in Table 2 with the results in Table 3.

Overall the results are fairly similar.

Again by a likelihood ratio test of restricted versus

unrestricted models, the IV studies appear to suffer from reporting bias whereas the OLS studies
do not. The results in the top panel of Table 4 provide perhaps the most general summary of our
analysis. The results in this panel reject the hypothesis that there is no publication bias. The
benchmark estimates of the overall average return to schooling is 3.5% in 1974, but increasing at
a rate of about 2 percentage points per decade. The estimated unexplained heterogeneity in rates
of return, which is reduced with the use of the covariates in Table 4, has a standard deviation of
around 2.6 percentage points. The IV and within-twins estimates of the return are 1.8 and 0.9
percentage points higher than the OLS estimates, and the difference between the IV and OLS
estimates is statistically significant while the difference between the within-twins and OLS
estimates are not.

However, these “reporting-bias-corrected” differences in returns due to

estimation method are much smaller than the uncorrected differences of 3.1 and 1.6 percentage
points reported in Panel A of Table 2. Ability control have no effect on the estimated rates of
return, but there remains evidence that returns have increased over time, at a rate of about 2
percentage points per decade.

Conclusion

There appears little controversy in the general principle underpinning the theory of schooling and
earnings - schooling adds considerably to the earnings of individuals. What is at the centre of the
debate is that in any context schooling is a choice variable and may not be independent of other
factors that affect earnings. This raises the possibility that the observed correlation between
schooling and earnings is not a causal relationship, but merely masks a correlation between other
factors, such as ability, and earnings.
16

Studies of twins and other siblings and studies that use instrumental variables have been a
major focus of research in the last decade in sophisticated attempts to measure the causal effect of
schooling on earnings.

Our survey of these studies suggests that, once the impact of the

likelihood that a study result will be reported is controlled, there are relatively small differences
among the estimates produced by the different estimation methods although some of these
differences are statistically significant. Estimated rates of return to schooling appear to be higher
in the U.S. than elsewhere, in part because of increased returns in the U.S. in the last two
decades. However apart from this difference the estimates of the returns are considerably closer
to each other than a simple glance at the range of estimates would provide. The evidence that
schooling investments have a significant economic payoff is therefore very strong.
A number of future directions exist for this research. For many purposes it is often more
useful to know the returns to specific types of schooling (by level and field) or the payoff to
increased quality of schooling. It appears that the current methodology to estimate returns to
years of schooling should be applied to these other topics as well. Likewise, studies of the
returns to work-related training (firm training) should be subject to similar analyses. These, and
related empirical studies of human capital investments, are essential to making wise public and
private choices.

APPENDIX – A GENERALIZED PUBLICATION BIAS MODEL
Hedges (1992) model of publication bias builds on the assumption that there is a weight function
that determines the probability that a study is observed. He posits that the weight function
depends on the p-value, whereby studies with a lower p-value are more likely to be observed. It is
assumed that a random effects model generates the observed data. More precisely the observed
data, X1 ,….,Xn are such that
X i ~ N ( δ, σ 2i ) ,

(A1)

where σi2 is known and δ is an unknown parameter distributed as
δ ~ N (∆, σ 2 ) .

(A2)

Hence
X i ~ N ( ∆, η i )

(A3)

where
σi2 + σ 2 = ηi .

The observation associated with each study forms part of the weight function

w(Xi) which determines the probability of being observed, with the relationship with Xi coming
via the p-value. In Hedges' formulation the weight function is a step function with the steps at
points determined a priori. In our application we distinguish three steps: 0<p<0.01, 0.01<p<0.05

21

and p>0.05 3 . Given this data generating process and the weight function, Hedges derives the
joint log-likelihood for the data X, which has the following form (Hedges 1992, p.250) for i
observations over j steps in the weight function,

2 i =1  η i  i =1

(A4)

where Bij(∆, σ) is the probability that a normally distributed random variable with mean ∆ and
variance ηi will be assigned weight value ωi.
The parameter ∆ can be interpreted as the true effect corrected for publication bias. This is
a sensible interpretation in applications where it is indeed reasonable to expect that there is one
uniform global effect. With medical interventions this might indeed be the case. When returns to
schooling are considered however, we have presented evidence that the returns vary between for
instance countries and periods. A natural extension of Hedges' likelihood function is therefore to
parameterize ∆ thereby allowing the true return to schooling to vary with some of these
characteristics. The extended likelihood function now reads:

where Zi is a vector of characteristics of study i and ∆ is (now) a vector of parameters to be
