    "abstract": "\n\nThe environmental impacts of economic production extend beyond those directly a\ufb00ecting humans. This paper provides new evidence on the link between production and ecosystem decline using a novel dataset that compiles longitudinal ecological sampling information at tens of thousands of locations across the United States between 1960 and 2015. Local shocks in economic production, such as those driven by national military buildups, led to a signi\ufb01cant reduction in species abundance, diversity, and stability, with one-third of the observed effects explained by the causal impact of air pollution. Government environmental regulations signi\ufb01cantly mitigated production externalities.\n\n",
