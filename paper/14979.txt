Analyzing the Extent and Influence of Occupational Licensing on the Labor Market

ABSTRACT
This study examines the extent and influence of occupational licensing in the U.S. using a specially
designed national labor force survey. Specifically, we provide new ways of measuring occupational
licensing and consider what types of regulatory requirements and what level of government oversight
contribute to wage gains and variability. Estimates from the survey indicated that 35 percent of employees
were either licensed or certified by the government, and that 29 percent were fully licensed. Another
3 percent stated that all who worked in their job would eventually be required to be certified or licensed,
bringing the total that are or eventually must be licensed or certified by government to 38 percent.
We find that licensing is associated with about 14 percent higher wages, but the effect of governmental
certification on pay is much smaller. Licensing by multiple political jurisdictions is associated with
the highest wage gains relative to only local licensing. Specific requirements by the government for
a worker to enter an occupation, such as education level and long internships, are positively associated
with wages. We find little association between licensing and the variance of wages, in contrast to unions.
Overall, our results show that occupational licensing is an important labor market phenomenon that
can be measured in labor force surveys.

Introduction
Occupational licensing as a topic in economics dates back at least to the comments by
Adam Smith that trades conspire to reduce the availability of skilled craftsmen in order to raise
wages (Smith, 1937). The public policy and legal communities, however, have noted that
regulating occupations in order to protect the public against incompetent, untrustworthy, or
irresponsible practitioners is in the public interest (Thomas v. Collins, 1945).
Since Friedman and Kuznets’s (1945) classic work, there has been little analysis of the
labor market influence of occupational regulation in economics (exceptions are Rottenberg,
1980; Kleiner, 2006; and Kleiner and Krueger, 2008).1 A major reason for the lack of empirical
work has been the absence of national data that clearly defined whether a worker was regulated
and the extent of regulation. The purpose of this study is to probe in greater detail the prospects
for measuring occupational licensing in a new detailed labor force survey and to estimate the
labor market effects of occupational licensing. Specifically, we delve into what types of
regulatory requirements -- and the particular level of government oversight -- may contribute to
wage gains and wage variability.
We use the results of a new telephone survey of the workforce conducted by Westat that
asked detailed questions on occupational regulation as well as questions on the labor market
status of individuals. The survey questions were developed as part of the Princeton Data
Improvement Initiative (PDII). These questions probe the kind of government regulation
1

Since 2000 no articles on occupational licensing have appeared in some of the major economic journals, including
the American Economic Review, the Journal of Political Economy, the Quarterly Journal of Economics, and
Econometrica. During the same period, only one article on licensing has appeared in the Journal of Labor
Economics and the Industrial and Labor Relations Review—often regarded as the top two labor economics journals.
In contrast, 16 articles on unionization have been published since 2000 in these two journals. Moreover, associations
such as the Labor and Employment Relations Association and the International Industrial Relations Research
Association have been devoted to research on labor-management issues, but no such academic organizations exist
that focus on occupational licensing.

required to perform a job, the process of becoming licensed, and the level of education and tests
necessary to become licensed. Results of the Westat survey, as well as separate validation
results from a Gallup survey, indicate that occupational licensing can be reasonably well
measured in labor force surveys.
Turning to the substantive results, we find that licensing is associated with about 14
percent higher wages, but government certification has a much smaller association with pay.
Licensing by multiple political jurisdictions, such as regulation by the states and the federal
government, is associated with higher wage gains than local regulations. Specific requirements
by the government to enter an occupation, such as education level and long internships, are
positively associated with wages. This pattern of results is consistent with a monopoly model of
occupational licensing; where supply is more restricted if the licensing authority operates on a
wider geographic level.
Background on Characteristics of Licensing
Occupational regulation in the United States generally takes three forms. The least
restrictive form is registration, in which individuals file their names, addresses, and
qualifications with a government agency before practicing their occupation. The registration
process may include posting a bond or filing a fee. In contrast, certification permits any person to
perform the relevant tasks, but the government—or sometimes a private, nonprofit agency—
administers an examination and certifies those who have achieved the level of skill and
knowledge for certification. For example, travel agents and car mechanics are generally certified
but not licensed. The toughest form of regulation is licensure; this form of regulation is often
referred to as “the right to practice.” Under licensure laws, working in an occupation for
compensation without first meeting government standards is illegal. In 2003 the Council of State
2

Governments estimated that more than 800 occupations were licensed in at least one state, and
more than 1,100 occupations were licensed, certified, or registered (Council on Licensure,
Enforcement and Regulation [CLEAR], 2004).
Prior to our survey, the data available on occupational licensing in the U.S. was restricted
to classifications as to whether various occupations were licensed at the state level, often based
on the CLEAR data. These classifications could be linked to Census occupational employment
data to derive estimates of the proportion of workers in licensed jobs. While informative, there
are clear limitations of such data. First, compliance with state licensing requirements could be
less than complete; some of these classified as working in licensed occupations may not in fact
be licensed. Second, in some occupations there is a trial period when workers can work in a job
before becoming licensed. Third, and probably most important, the state data miss licensing that
takes place at the local and federal level.
Despite these serious limitations, the state-level data show some striking trends. During
the early 1950s, less than 5 percent of the U.S. workforce was in occupations covered by
licensing laws at the state level (Council of State Governments, 1952). That number grew to
almost 18 percent by the 1980s—with an even larger number if federal, city, and county
occupational licensing is included. By 2000, the percentage of the workforce in occupations
licensed by states was at least 20 percent, according to data gathered from the Department of
Labor and the 2000 Census. In contrast, during this period no systematic attempts were made to
gather information on licensing or its wage or employment effects at the federal or local level.
As employment in the United States shifted from manufacturing to service industries,
which typically have lower union representation, the members of the occupations established a
3

formal set of standards that governed members of the occupation. For a professional association,
obtaining licensing legislation meant raising funds from members to lobby the state legislature,
particularly the chairs of appropriate committees. In addition, the occupation association often
solicits volunteers from its membership to work on legislative campaigns. With both financial
contributions and volunteers, the occupational association has a significant ability to influence
legislation and its administration, especially when opposition to regulatory legislation is absent
or minimal (Wheelan, 1998). The large potential gain from regulation through increased demand
for the service, enhanced earnings, and the ability to restrict supply outweighs the potential
losses to consumers of potentially higher prices for the regulated services.
Figure 1 shows trends in the growth of occupational licensing and unionization from
1950 to 2008.2 Licensing data for earlier periods are available only at the state/occupational
level; the data gathered through the Gallup and Westat surveys for 2006 and 2008 are denoted
with a dashed line in the figure. Despite possible problems in both data series, occupational
licensing clearly is rising and unionization is declining. By 2008, approximately 29 percent of
workers polled in the Westat survey said they were required to have a government-issued license
to do their job, compared with about 12.4 percent who said they were union members in the
Current Population Survey (CPS) for the same year.
Wage Determination and Licensing: Background

2

The method used to calculate the percentage licensed prior to 2006 first involved gathering the listing of licensed
occupations in each state by Labor Market Information units under a grant from the U.S. Department of Labor (see
America’s Career InfoNet,
http://www.acinet.org/acinet/licensedoccupations/lois_occ.aspx?stfips=27&by=occ&keyword=&searchType=&).
This was matched with occupations in the 2000 Census. If no match was obtained, the occupation was dropped.
From the Census the number working in the licensed occupation in each state was estimated and used to calculate a
weighted average of the percentage of the workforce in the United States that works in a licensed occupation. For
2008 we deleted individuals who were certified from our tally of individuals who were either licensed or certified in
our survey conducted by Westat.

How can licensing raise wages? Unlike unions, which can engage in concerted activities such
as strikes or work slowdowns, licensed workers do not sign collective agreements with their
employers. Nor do they engage in strikes against employers to raise wages. Occupational
licensing can affect pay and employment through three main channels. First, licensing may
increase quality by imposing initial education, testing, continuing training requirements,
internship requirements, or fees. These requirements are likely to diminish the number of less
qualified or unmotivated individuals who could enter the occupation, and thereby serve to drive
up the average quality of workers in an occupation. A consequence is higher quality outcomes
for those who are able to obtain the service, but fewer practitioners and less access to the service.
Second, by using the state to monitor and prevent the potential work effort of unlicensed
workers, competition by unlicensed individuals is virtually eliminated through the use of the
state’s enforcement powers. For example, the work of “hair braiders,” which is unlicensed,
could be brought under the control of the cosmetology board and limited to only licensed
cosmetologists or barbers (Anderson v. Minnesota Board of Barber and Cosmetology Examiners,
2005). Further, when demand fluctuates for traditional tasks, the board has the ability to expand
the regulated work through establishing administrative rules and limiting the work of unregulated
workers. Third, the regulatory board through its administrative procedures of establishing large
entry barriers and moral suasion can reduce the number of openings in schools that prepare
individuals for licensed positions. In addition, by adjusting the pass rate on the licensing exam,
they can change the number of new entrants from instate or migrants from other states or nations
(Tenn, 2001, Pagliero, 2009).

5

Some evidence suggests that licensing does restrict the supply of workers in regulated
occupations. One application focuses on the comparison of occupations that are licensed in
some states and not in others. The occupations examined were librarians (licensed in 19 states),
respiratory therapists (licensed in 35 states), and dietitians and nutritionists (licensed in 36 states)
from 1990 to 2000 using Census data (Kleiner, 2006). Using controls for state characteristics, the
multivariate estimates showed that in the states where the occupations were unlicensed there was
a 20 percent faster growth rate than in states that did license these occupations. Another study
found that the imposition of greater licensing requirements for funeral directors is associated
with fewer women holding jobs as funeral directors relative to men by 18 to 24 percent (Cathles,
Harrington, and Krynski, 2009).
Studies of the effects of licensing on wages have, in many ways, paralleled the research
methods used to study the effect of unions on wages (Lewis, 1986). These approaches include
cross-section estimates, switchers from regulated to unregulated and vice versa over time, and
cross-sectional results from within occupation comparisons. The general estimates of crosssectional studies using Census data of state licensing’s influence on wages with standard labor
market controls show a range from 10 to 15 percent for higher wages associated with
occupational licensing. Estimates were developed from the National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth (NLSY) from 1984 to 2000 and show the difference in wages between changers from
unlicensed to licensed occupations and between those who move from a licensed occupation to
an unregulated one. The estimates show an impact of about 17 percent of moving to a licensed
occupation relative to moving from a licensed occupation to an unlicensed one. However,
within-occupation wage variations both for service occupations and for individuals in jobs that
repair things suggest a wide range of wages changes from zero to 40 percent of regulation within
6

an occupation. Although these results suggest that licensing—the toughest form of regulation—
matters for wage determination, these estimates do not use national estimates, do not examine the
levels of government that matter, and do not consider the influence of the requirements to
become licensed, such as education, testing, or internships that may further enhance wages.
The Survey Instrument and Design
Our survey is part of the PDII, a multi-researcher project to develop new questions and
methods for economic surveys. The questionnaire was patterned after the CPS and included
additional questions on career experience, job tasks, and offshorability of jobs. In the summer of
2008, Westat (www.westat.com) conducted a national random digit dial (RDD) survey on behalf
of Princeton University. Princeton provided Westat with a draft of a questionnaire at the start of
the project. Princeton and Westat collaborated in finalizing the question order and wording. A
number of the questions had been developed and tested in earlier work by Princeton and under
prior task order contracts with Westat. Several questions regarding the respondent’s employer,
job activities, and demographics were taken from the CPS. Westat programmed the questionnaire
and skip patterns for administration by Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI), in
both English and Spanish. Westat staff pretested the instrument with several volunteer
respondents. This pretest suggested several additional revisions for the questionnaire, including
shortening it to achieve the targeted average interview length of 15 minutes.
Westat conducted the survey from June 5 to July 20, 2008.3 Individuals age 18 or older
who were in the labor force were eligible for the survey. A total of 2,513 individuals were
interviewed. We limit our analysis to those who were employed at the time of the survey. Westat

used a RDD sampling design constructed from a national sampling frame of residential
exchanges. The selected numbers were called and screened to identify households with eligible
respondents. One respondent was randomly selected from each eligible household to complete
the survey using the nearest birthday procedure. Up to 15 callbacks were made to try to elicit
responses. Some 28 percent of sampled eligible households agreed to participate in the screening
of questions, and 64 percent of the selected individuals in screened households completed the
questionnaire. Thus, the response rate was 17.9 percent, using the American Association for
Public Opinion Research response rate definition 3 (see
aapor.org/uploads/Standard_Definitions_04_08_Final.pdf, p. 35). 4
Although the survey response rate is low compared to many government labor force
surveys, it is comparable to that in commercial surveys. While the low response rate is
potentially worrisome, Groves and Peytcheva (2008) show that survey nonresponse rates by
themselves are not necessarily associated with significant bias. Low response rates are a concern
when the causes of participation in the survey are correlated with the survey variables of interest.
We suspect that occupational licensing is not strongly associated with the tendency to complete
the survey. The response rate was low in large part because many households declined to
participate in the screener questions, which did not mention occupational licensing. Another
reason for placing some confidence in the representativeness of our sample is that a standard
4

Among the households, 18,520 telephone numbers were screened to be residential. Of these,
4,079 households had eligible persons and 2,086 did not, meaning that the latter households had
no adults in the labor force at the time of the interview. For the remaining residential telephone
numbers (12,355), it was not possible to ascertain eligibility status. Therefore, an eligibility
status adjustment was performed using new adjustment cells defined by the Census Region,
Metropolitan Statistical Area status, and median income of the telephone exchange. Five median
income categories were defined, and there were altogether 50 adjustment cells.
8

Mincerian wage regression using data from the survey closely matched the corresponding
regression from the CPS (see the Appendix). Although we would have preferred a higher
response rate, we have no reason to believe that nonresponse skews our results in favor of
finding more or less occupational licensing and certification, or particular associations between
licensing and certification and earnings.
Westat developed survey weights to compensate for variation in selection probabilities,
differential response rates, and possible under coverage of the sampling frame. The derivation of
the sample weights focused primarily on matching the marginal distributions of the CPS by sex,
age, educational attainment, census region, urbanization, race, Hispanic ethnicity, employment
status, and class of employer (private, government, etc.).
Westat collected information on the location where the license or certificate was
registered for a random sample of 221 respondents who answered yes to a question that they
were licensed. Westat subsequently used this information to try to verify whether the respondent
had a valid occupational license or certificate. Our results show that of the 71 individuals for
whom Westat could find information, 20 were believed to have answered the question
incorrectly and 5 were found to have an inactive license or other status. For the individuals that
Westat could verify, 47 could be found through a government database that was publicly
available. Consequently, two-thirds of the sample could be easily verified as having a
government license.5

5

Of the 20 respondents that were believed to answer incorrectly, 11 indicated they were licensed at the federal level,
15 at the state level, and 11 at the local level. About half of the respondents indicated that they were required to have
a license by more than one level of government, and that the inability to find the license could be an issue of the
surveyor looking at the incorrect level of government, or that the data were not listed on a readily accessible
computer within the department.

Questionnaire and Data
We designed a module to assess the accuracy of self-reported occupational licensing and
certification. The key questions were as follows:
Q11. Do you have a license or certification that is required by a federal, state or local government agency
to do your job?
YES ...................................................................... 1
NO ........................................................................ 2 (Go to Q25)
IN PROCESS/WORKING ON IT....................... 3
Q11a. Would someone who does not have a license or certificate be legally allowed to do your job?
YES ...................................................................... 1
NO ........................................................................ 2
Q12. Is everyone who does your job eventually required to have a license or certification by a federal,
state or local government agency?
YES ...................................................................... 1
NO ........................................................................ 2

Those who answered affirmatively to Q11 were asked additional questions about the
agency (federal, state or local) that required their license or certificate, and the requirements they
needed to satisfy, such as achieving a high school or college degree, passing a test,
demonstrating certain skills, or completing an internship or apprenticeship.
The responses to our analysis showed that 35 percent of the respondents answered that
they were either licensed or certified in question 11. Approximately 6 percent stated that
individuals who did not have a license could do the work in question 11a, which is the definition
of government certification. Another 3 percent stated that all who worked would eventually be
required to be certified or licensed, bringing the total that are or eventually must be licensed or
certified by government to 38 percent.
10

To further examine the test-retest validity of our results for the licensing question, we
examined the consistency of responses over several days of the week using data gathered from a
time use survey by the Gallup Organization. The Gallup survey asked individuals on Thursday
and Saturday whether they were licensed. In Table 1 we show the consistency of the responses in
comparison to a question on years of education. Of the responses, 98.2 percent were consistent in
their responses for licensing, but only 91.1 percent provided consistent answers when stating
their level of education on two different days that were three days apart. Overall, individuals are
internally consistent and apparently reliable in reporting whether they hold a license from
government in order to do their work.
Who Is Licensed?
To explore the basic demographic and economic characteristics of regulated workers, we
examine the distribution of licensed occupations by education, race, union status, public or
private sector, and gender in Table 2. The results indicate that licensing rises with education:
more than 40 percent of those with post college education are required to have a license
compared to only 15 percent for those with less than a high school education. The results in the
Table show that union members are more likely to be licensed, reflecting in part the large
number of teachers and nurses who tend to be both union members and licensed. Government
workers are more likely to have a license than nongovernment workers, but there is no difference
in the rate of licensing by gender.
We find similar licensing rates for men and women, whites, blacks, and Hispanics. The
table also shows that licensing rises with age and then declines slightly over age 54. Table 2 also
presents further the distribution by industry and union status. Licensing is also much more
11

prevalent for those who provide services or repair items than those who make things on their
jobs.
The questionnaire also asked questions about the governmental level of licensing for the
individuals in our sample. In our survey about two-thirds of the licensed individuals in our
sample are licensed at the state level, followed by the federal and local levels. In general
occupations commonly required to have state licenses range from attorneys and dentists to dental
hygienists and mortgage brokers. Individuals who usually are federally licensed workers range
from workers such as quality assurance inspectors for the Federal Aviation Administration to
stockbrokers. At the local level, taxi drivers and massage therapists are often licensed by this
political jurisdiction. The federal courts have largely left licensing as a state issue, since this is
the level of government that has largely regulated workers in the United States (Dent v. West
Virginia, 1888). Nevertheless, the courts have determined that licensing by the states can
contradict the Sherman Act (Goldfarb v. Virginia, 1975). The Supreme Court ruled that the state
attorney bar association’s policy of a minimum fee schedule violated the Sherman Act’s
prohibition of combinations in restraint of trade. The Court ruled that the legal profession was
not a public service, but rather a market-driven service. These court decisions have made the
focus of most licensing as largely a state legal and economic policy issue rather than a federal or
local issue.
The requirements necessary to enter an occupation potentially influence the quality of
services rendered and serve as a barrier to entry. Table 3 gives the percentage of licensed
workers from our survey data that require a college education, a high school education or GED,
an internship or apprenticeship, passage of a test, demonstration of qualifications, fees,
12

continuing education, and continued testing to maintain a license. For example, 85 percent of
those persons licensed were required to take an exam, almost 70 percent were required to take
continuing education classes, more than half require an internship, and almost 43 percent require
at least a college education. Each of the requirements can enhance the quality of the practitioners
in the occupation or restrict entry and thereby reduce competition for performing the work.
Occupational Regulation and Wages
To examine whether licensing is associated with higher pay, we present estimates of log
wage regressions in the estimated model in Table 4.6 We augment a standard earnings equation
to include a dummy variable indicating whether a license is required for the worker’s job. We
regard these estimates as mainly descriptive, since licensed workers may differ from unlicensed
workers in unobserved ways, even after we condition on education and occupation. If a dummy
indicating license status is added to a standard wage equation, having a license is associated with
approximately 14 percent higher hourly earnings depending on the detail of the specification of
occupational control variables (p-value < 0.001). When we include detailed occupation controls
such as two-digit ones in column 2, the coefficient rises to .199 and then falls when four-digit
controls are introduced in column 3, but the coefficient on licensing is still a robust 11 percent.7
The cross-sectional effect of licensing is similar in magnitude to the estimated effect of
belonging to a union (see Lewis, 1986), and greater than an additional year of schooling. The

6

We also attempted to instrument for licensing by using the state licensing for occupation such as electricians,
plumbers, and teachers but were not able to find a robust instrument in our first stage estimates. Additional attempts
at finding appropriate instrumental variables (IVs ) included political affiliation of the state, state of residence, and
union coverage in the state, but with limited predictive power.
7
Our estimates show no differences in the influence of licensing by gender. Further, by not including a licensing
variable, the impact of unionization is biased upward in a standard wage equation.

13

regression estimates also include educational attainment, age, self employment, career
experience and its square, union status, and industry and occupation dummy variables.8
A distinguishing characteristic of the Westat survey is that the variable for career
experience is the reported actual experience of the respondents rather than an estimate based on
age and education (Blau and Kahn, 2008). Specifically, the question for experience was: “Since
age 18, in how many years altogether have you worked for pay or profit? Please count all years
in which you worked either all or part of the year.” The variable tracked well the traditional
variable for experience used in human capital analysis. A major policy issue for the
governmental regulation of occupations is the role for certification, which allows others to do the
work but allows individuals to earn a title that signifies that they achieved certain requirements.
Unlike licensing, for certification there are no restrictions other than titling for doing the task for
pay.9 In Table 5 we estimate wage equations similar to those in Table 4 using largely the same
covariates but add an indicator for certification status. We find that the certification variables,
although positive, are usually not statistically significant and the coefficients are of a much
smaller in magnitude than was found for licensing, averaging between 7 and 11 percent. When
more occupational details are added, the coefficients rise to 11 percent with two-digit controls
but fall to 7 percent when four-digit controls are added with less precisely estimated coefficients.

8

We also estimated all the wage equations for only occupations that were regulated in some states and not in others,
(e.g., interior designers and mortgage brokers). Our estimates show that that licensing was always statistically
significant, with point estimates ranging from 9 to 17 percent. There was no qualitative change in the estimates by
dropping universally licensed occupations from the analysis of the survey. These estimates are available from the
authors.
9
The nomenclature surrounding licensing and certification can be confusing. For example, a Certified Public
Accountant (CPA) is licensed rather than certified as we use the terms as someone who is not qualified as a CPA
cannot perform the work of a CPA.

14

The results of these wage equations are consistent with the interpretation that licensing
policy enables the individuals in a licensed job to obtain a degree of monopoly control, or the
ability to “fence out” competitors for a service, which results in increased wages for licensed
workers. Licensing policies, with regulations that require additional effort to get into the
occupation, matter more in wage determination than the government merely giving its approval
of a title for an occupation.
To further probe the role of occupational licensing, we next examine whether the level of
governmental jurisdiction that issues occupational licenses matters for wage determination.
Specifically, as shown in Table 6, we allow for a differential effect of licensing at the county or
city, state, or federal level. In our sample, 49 percent of the respondents reported that they were
licensed at only one level of government, while the others reported that they had licenses from
more than one governmental venue. A basis of comparison in our estimates is individuals who
have a license but do not need it for their jobs. For example, a manager in a large firm may be a
licensed attorney, but his or her license is not required for the position. Our estimates are
intended to examine the influence of having one or multiple jurisdictional levels of licensure on
wages. Overall, licensing at the state level is associated with the largest and most consistent
effect on wages. As shown in the first row of Table 6, licensing at the state level is associated
with earnings growth of 9 to 17 percent, depending on the number of occupational control
variables. None of the other political jurisdictions show precisely estimated coefficients across
the three specifications with varying numbers of occupational controls. Further, the interaction of
state with either federal or local government levels of regulation is precisely estimated with
coefficient estimates ranging from 20 to 26 percent.

15

Our results show the largest influence of the level of government licensing on wages is
greatest at the state and federal levels. Local licenses are not associated with pay increases.
Potential reasons for the decline in the precision of the estimates for licensing at the local level
may be that licensing for low-paid jobs, such as taxi licenses and tattoo parlors, are often left to
local governments. Further, local licensing is less likely to be a restriction on competition than
state or federal licensing, since customers can call a taxi from an unlicensed jurisdiction or visit a
neighboring town for a tattoo. Based on these estimates, we conclude that licensing is a labor
market institution that matters in wage determination at least as much unionization.
Probing the Anatomy of Wage Effects
What elements of licensing requirements contribute to the wage advantage captured by
licensed practitioners? In Table 7 we probe the provisions of licensing regulations that enhance
the wage premium of regulated practitioners. In order to obtain a license, individuals in
occupations often are required to meet general education requirements that include graduation
from high school or college, and occupation-specific requirements such as a long internship,
some lasting more than a year, and attending continuing education classes following entry into
the field. In addition, for entry into an occupation, passing an examination is generally required.
The effects of testing for entry is an issue that has been raised by Milton Friedman and others,
who hypothesized and provided evidence that the members of the occupation can manipulate the
pass rate to restrict entry and raise wages (Friedman, 1962; Maurizi, 1974; Kleiner and Kudrle,
2000; and Kleiner, 2006). Although we find that the provision of requiring a college education is
associated with an hourly pay increase of more than 17 percent (Table 7, column 1) with no
occupational controls, the result is not robust to specifications that add additional occupational
16

controls. None of the other specific requirements are robust in their statistical significance across
all specifications; however, the requirements together are all significant at the p-value < 0.01
using an F-test for the joint significance of the requirements to obtain and maintain a license in
the specifications in the table. The requirements for entering and remaining in a licensed
occupation may act in a nonlinear manner to enhance the earnings of practitioners.
Job Tasks of Regulated Practitioners
Do licensed occupations perform more sophisticated cognitive work tasks, such as doing
difficult math and reading assignments? If so, perhaps the wage premium is economic returns to
higher cognitive abilities and tasks. Moreover, are licensed or government-certified tasks more
education-intensive, which would account for some of the wage premium obtained by regulated
workers? In order to address this question using the data from the PDII survey, we examine
question 25, which asks the self-reported use of math and reading abilities of the practitioners.
For example, the reading question asks: “What (is/was) the longest document that you typically
read as part of your job?” And the math question asks: “How often (do/did) you solve problems
at your jobs using advanced mathematics such as algebra, geometry, trigonometry, probability,
or calculus?”
Table 8 analyzes reading utilization, and Table 9 examines math use when occupational
regulation is taken into account. The estimates in these tables show that regulated practitioners
are somewhat more likely to do more reading tasks at their workplace, controlling for standard
human capital, demographic, and occupation variables that are available in the survey. Although
licensed workers have a positive, albeit small, impact on reading use, certified workers, such as
librarians and technicians, are much more likely to engage in detailed reading relative to either
17

unregulated or licensed practitioners. Table 9 shows that regulated occupations do more mathrelated tasks (see column 1), but the influence is diminished once controls for detailed
occupations are added. Although licensed occupations appear to do somewhat more work that
requires cognitive tasks, the results of the influence of occupational regulation vary when the
detailed occupations are included.
Does Licensing Influence Wage Dispersion?
In order to examine the influence of licensing on the variance in wages, we examine the
mean within category squared residual from a log of wage regressions in both licensed and
unlicensed occupations, controlling for human capital characteristics. We also compare union
and nonunion earnings as a point of reference, since unions have been shown to reduce variations
in wages (Freeman, 1982). Table 10 presents the mean residual variance in each sector and the
difference between licensed and unlicensed jobs. The measure of dispersion of wages among
licensed jobs is about the same as or only slightly smaller than that among unregulated ones and
the p-value for difference in the mean squared error is not significant. In contrast, the lower part
of the table shows that unionization reduces the variance in wages. These results are similar to
those found with a different data set in Kleiner and Krueger (2008), suggesting the robustness of
the findings for the role of unions and licensing over time and across different surveys.
Conclusions
We show that occupational licensing is an important labor market phenomenon that is
pervasive and likely has a large influence on wage determination. Using a specially designed
survey of a nationally representative sample of Americans carried out by Westat, we provide an
18

examination of the prevalence and influence of various forms of occupational licensing. We
show that the consistency of reporting in having a license is high, but that it is more difficult to
externally verify licensing through government databases, in part due to the lack of on-line or
computer-readable data of licensed practitioners by states and local governments.
Licensing is a growing phenomenon in the U.S. economy, reaching almost 29 percent of
workers in our 2008 survey. Workers who have higher levels of education are more likely to
work in jobs that require a license, and most licensing is implemented at the state level. The
requirement of government regulation, especially regulation at both the state and local level or
the state and federal level, is associated with higher wages relative to those in jobs that only
require local licensing. Certification, a weaker form of government regulation that allows others
(noncertified workers) to work in the occupation, has a much smaller effect on wages. Workers
who are licensed or certified do work that is associated with greater use of reading and somewhat
more use of mathematical tasks. Unlike unions, which appear to reduce wage variation, licensing
does not appear to diminish wage variation.
On balance, our results also lend support for the interpretation that occupational licensing
serves as a means to enforce entry barriers to a profession that raise wages. Furthermore, our
finding that licensing is associated with a larger wage premium when the license is issued at the
state as opposed to local level suggests that competition is more effectively restricted when there
is no possibility of obtaining a service from an unlicensed provider in a nearby locality. Our
estimates of the relationship of occupational licensing and wages is consistent with the
hypothesized role by members of an occupation to raise wages by using the powers of
government to drive up requirements and capture work for the regulated workers for larger
19

geographic areas. These estimates suggest a strong role for the monopoly face of licensing in the
labor market. Indeed, the wage premium associated with licensing is strikingly similar to that
found in studies of the effect of unions on wages (Freeman and Medoff, 1984, Lewis, 1986). It
is possible, however, that omitted variables are correlated with both licensing and wages, which
confound our results. With the large and growing number of workers required to obtain an
occupational license, and the apparently large effect of licensing requirements on the labor
market, we think it would be prudent for statistical agencies to measure and monitor the extent of
occupational licensing. This can be accomplished in a manner similar to the way in which
information is collected for unions in labor force surveys, such as the CPS. We have
demonstrated how such questions can be asked in a labor force survey, and have provided some
indication of the reliability and utility of the resulting data. Adding these questions to a survey
like the CPS would help to answer questions such as: How much regulation is optimal for
productivity growth? Does occupational licensing lead to better consumer protection and higher
quality? How does the licensing premium vary across occupations, industries and regions? Is
the pace of occupational licensing rising or falling? And what is the interaction between
licensing and unionization?
