Labor Versus Capital in Trade-Policy Determination:
The Role of General-Interest and Special-Interest Politics

ABSTRACT
Trade policy depends on the extent to which the government wants to redistribute income as well
as on a country's overall factor endowments and their distribution. While the government's desire
to redistribute income itself is dependent on asset distribution, it is to a large extent also driven by
the partisan nature of the government, i.e., whether it is pro-labor or pro-capital. Using cross-country
data on factor endowments, inequality and government orientation, we find that, conditional on
inequality, left-wing (pro-labor) governments will adopt more protectionist trade policies in capitalrich countries, but adopt more pro-trade policies in labor-rich economies than right-wing (procapital) ones. Also, holding government orientation constant, higher inequality is associated with
higher protection in capital-abundant countries while it is associated with lower protection in laborabundant countries. These results are consistent with the simultaneous presence of both general- as
well as special-interest politics as determinants of protection within a two-factor, two-sector
Heckscher-Ohlin framework. Overall, various statistical tests support an umbrella model (that
combines both the general-interest as well as special-interest models) over each of the individual
models.

Introduction

Most trade economists like to think about the impact of trade and trade policy in terms of their
consequences for capitalists and workers. For example, in the presence of intersectoral factor
mobility, raising barriers to international trade in goods will help capital and hurt labor or vice
versa, depending on whether the country’s comparative advantage is in labor- or capital-intensive
products. Thus, an important eﬀect and sometimes an important objective of trade policy is
the redistribution of income from capital to labor or vice versa. One possible determinant of
such redistribution is the political valence or the partisanship of the government, which refers
to whether the government is pro-labor (left-oriented), pro-capital (right-oriented) or relatively
neutral (centrist). In other words, there is always a tendency for governments to redistribute,
through trade policy and other policy instruments, income to their constituents and supporters
from the rest of the society. This aspect of policy determination is driven by what we call “specialinterest” politics.
In this context, it is interesting to note that the tradition of linking political parties to classes
(factors of production) can be traced back to traditional theories of party systems where party
classification is generally studied in terms of the capital-labor (or sometimes, the rural-urban)
dichotomy (Lipset and Rokkan (1997)). For over two decades now, scholars have analyzed the
eﬀects of partisanship on macroeconomic policy. The most important contributions in this area
are those by Hibbs (1977), Alt (1985) and Alesina (1987), all of whom, in this context, have
focused on the trade-oﬀ between inflation and unemployment. Recent research on the eﬀects of
partisanship, however, has gone beyond macroeconomic policy. In particular, using OECD data,
Garret (1998) looks at how globalization has changed the way in which fiscal policy responds to
partisanship, while Swank (2002) looks at how the response of welfare expenditure to globalization
depends on the nature of the state and the relative strengths of interest groups.1
1 In studying the eﬀects of partisanship, Adsera and Boix (2002) model endogenous trade regime (free trade
versus autarky) as well as government size and show the possibility of multiple equilibria - autarky (free trade)

However, in studying class- or factor-based “special-interest” politics, one needs to take account
of the fact that there might not be a clear division in society between workers and capitalists. While
raw labor power might be pretty uniformly distributed, human and physical capital ownership
might not be so. The existence of such an asset distribution, in which each individual owns some
of both factors, means that everyone in society is a capitalist and a worker to relatively diﬀerent
degrees. Thus people with extremes in relative factor ownership are close to being either pure
workers or pure capitalists. However, such heterogeneity in asset ownership can exactly be the
basis for varying levels of protection, depending on the degree of inequality. This can be derived
in a model where policy is determined by majority voting (Mayer (1984)). In other words, due
to the inherently unequal nature of asset and income distribution (where the majority of the
individuals have their asset holdings below the mean), any government will have a tendency to
redistribute income from those who look more like capitalists to those who look more like workers.
This does not necessarily arise from the altruistic nature of the government but rather from its
self interest to get elected or survive by winning the support of the majority. This second aspect
of policy determination is called “general-interest” politics and can either reinforce or neutralize
the forces of special interest politics, depending on the government’s political valence or ideology.
The precise manner in which the political ideology or valence aﬀects trade policy is the following. The eﬀect of an increase in the leftist orientation of the government can be viewed as an
increase in the weight on labor welfare relative to capital welfare in the government’s objective
function (which for the purpose of this analysis is defined as a weighted sum of worker and capitalist welfare).2 ’

3

This increase in the labor-welfare weight results in policies that are more

pro-labor and that make the domestic terms of trade move in favor of the labor-intensive sector.
with small (large) government and an authoritarian free-trade, small-government regime.
2 This is the political-support function approach popularized by Hillman (1989) and Van Long and Vousden
(1991).
3 In a world with all people owning both factors, but to diﬀerent extents, we can just assume weights given to
diﬀerent individuals in the government’s objective function to be monotonic in individual relative factor endowments. More specifically, in the objective function of a left-wing (right-wing) party in power, the weight on each
individual’s welfare will be decreasing (increasing) in the individual capital-to-labor endowment ratio. Thus, our
hypothesis on political ideology can be given a fairly general interpretation.

2

In a capital-abundant country, the labor-intensive good is the importable good and therefore, an
increase in the leftist orientation of the government will result in a rise in import protection. In
a labor-abundant country, however, the capital-intensive good is the importable and the laborintensive good is the exportable. Therefore, an increase in leftist orientation in such a country
that calls for a change in the domestic price ratio in favor of the labor-intensive exportable good
will result in a decline in import protection. We call this the “special-interest” hypothesis.
The median-voter prediction (which we call the “general-interest” hypothesis) we test is also
about cross-country variations in levels of trade barriers and not about the actual orientations
(signs) of the levels. More precisely, a simple comparative-static exercise in the Mayer-HeckscherOhlin framework (as in Mayer (1983)) shows that an increase in inequality (the diﬀerence between
the mean and the median capital-labor ratio), holding constant the economy’s overall relative
endowments, raises trade barriers in capital-abundant economies and lowers them in capitalscarce economies. An increase in inequality increases the general demand for redistribution from
capital to labor. This can be achieved through trade policies that increase further the factor
reward to labor but reduce the reward to capital, which in turn is achieved by increasing the
domestic relative price of the labor-intensive good in a two sector, two factor Heckscher-Ohlin
economy. Thus, an increase in inequality would result in a tightening of trade restrictions in
capital-abundant economies and their reduction in capital-scarce countries.
While in Dutt and Mitra (2002a) we explicitly focus on the empirical investigation of the
median-voter (general-interest) model of trade policy, in another paper, Dutt and Mitra (2002b),
we investigate the predictions of a special-interest model purely based on political ideology. We
now address the question whether these two models are complements or substitutes in predicting
trade policy. One possibility is that ideology and inequality are correlated, and therefore, these
models are observationally equivalent, i.e., they make roughly the same prediction and hence are
substitutes. The other possibility is that there is extra information from each of the models and
so a combination of the two models, which we call the “umbrella” model, is a better predictor of
3

trade policy than each of the individual models, that are complementary to each other.
We examine the two hypotheses (general-interest and special-interest) within a unified model
that potentially can nest both. For this empirical investigation, we use cross-country data on
relative factor endowments (capital per worker), political ideology, inequality and diﬀerent measures of protection. We perform standard F-tests as well as use Akaike, Schwarz and Amemiya
criteria to evaluate the umbrella model relative to the component models. The overall picture
that emerges from our analysis is that each component model provides information in addition to
the other component model and so the umbrella model generally dominates the two components.
Thus both special-interest politics and general-interest politics are complementary explanations
of overall protection and also determinants of welfare levels of workers and capitalists.
The contribution of our paper is two-fold. Firstly, our results uncover a robust empirical
regularity in the relationship between trade protection, inequality and political ideology, thereby
adding to the literature on political economy of trade policy. Also, we believe that this is the
first paper in the political economy literature that provides empirical evidence of the simultaneous
operation of complementary channels of special- and general-interest politics in policy determination.

2

Theoretical Framework

We now outline the two theoretical components of our “umbrella” econometric model. These are
discussed in detail in Dutt and Mitra (2002a and b).
Consider a two-factor, two-sector, small-open, Heckscher-Ohlin economy. Both goods require
both capital and labor in their production carried out under constant returns to scale. On the
demand side, individual preferences are taken to be identical and homothetic. We also assume
that tariﬀ revenues are distributed in proportion to the factor incomes earned by individuals.

4

2.1

Special-Interest Politics

For simplicity, we assume that there are two kinds of factor owners, workers (who only own labor)
and capitalists (who only own capital). The government chooses the level of the import tariﬀ
to maximize its objective function which is a weighted sum of the aggregate welfare of workers
and capital. Our main comparative static exercise here is to see how this tariﬀ varies with the
government’s weight on labor welfare (relative to the welfare of capitalists). This leads us to the
following proposition:
Proposition 1: Holding other things constant, an increase in the left orientation (prolabor bias) of the government leads to more restrictive or less open trade policies in
capital-abundant countries, while it leads to less restrictive or more open trade policies
in capital-scarce economies.
The above result is very intuitive. An increase in left orientation always results in an increase
in redistribution through policies that would benefit labor. In a capital-abundant country, the
importable is the labor-intensive good and an increase in redistribution from capital to labor
would increase the bias of policies in favor of the importable sector. In a labor-abundant economy,
the importable sector is the capital-intensive sector and hence more redistribution towards labor
requires policies that are more biased against the importable sector.

2.2

General-Interest Politics

We now change our assumption about asset ownership. For simplicity, we assume that each
individual owns one unit of labor. However, all people are also allowed to own capital but diﬀer in
their capital ownership.4 Assuming that the voters diﬀer only along a single dimension, namely in
their relative capital-labor endowment and that there are no voting costs (and imposing standard
4 As mentioned in the introduction, our special-interest model can easily be extended to a world with all people
owning both factors but to diﬀerent extents. In such a context, we can just assume weights given to diﬀerent
individuals in the government’s objective function to be monotonic in individual relative factor endowments. Thus,
there is virtually no loss of generality involved in the statement of proposition 1.

5

regularity conditions5 ), the tariﬀ under majority voting can be obtained using the median voter
theorem and is the one that maximizes the utility of the individual with the median relative
capital-labor endowment in the economy.
It is easy to see in this framework that an increase in inequality always results in an increase
in the demand for redistribution through policies that would benefit labor at the expense of
capital. In a capital-abundant country, the importable is the labor-intensive good and an increase
in the demand for redistribution from capital to labor would represent a demand for policies that
increasingly favor the importable sector. In a labor-abundant economy, the importable sector
is the capital-intensive sector and hence more redistribution towards labor requires policies that
are more biased against the importable sector. This leads us to the following proposition whose
empirical validity, along with that of proposition 1, we test in this paper:
Proposition 2: Holding other things constant, an increase in inequality leads to more
restrictive or less open trade policies in capital-abundant countries, while it leads to
less restrictive or more open trade policies in capital-scarce economies.

3

Econometric Methodology

We now write down an estimating equation that can nest the results of both propositions 1 and
2. As we see above, the relationships of protection with inequality and ideology change sign at
critical values of the capital-labor ratio. In countries with high (K/L) ratios, left-wing ideology
of the government and trade restrictiveness should be positively related, but when (K/L) is low
there is an inverse relationship between these two variables. A priori, we do not know at what
level of (K/L), this relationship changes sign. Besides, in countries with high (K/L) ratios,
inequality and trade restrictiveness should be positively related, but when (K/L) is low there is
an inverse relationship between these two. Again, a priori, we do not know at what level of (K/L),
this relationship changes sign. The following “umbrella” specification can help us with the exact
5

See Mayer (1984).

location of these turning points (critical values of the capital-labor ratio) of protection-ideology
and protection-inequality relationships:
T Ri = α0 + α1 Ideology i + α2 Ideology i × (K/L)i + α3 IN EQi + α4 IN EQi × (K/L)i + α5 (K/L)i +

i

(1)
where T Ri is the extent of trade restrictions in country i, Ideology i is a measure of the extent of
the government’s left-wing ideology, IN EQi is the level of inequality and (K/L)i the capital-labor
ratio.6 ’

7

The inclusion of (K/L) as a separate variable in addition to its cross products with

ideology and inequality allows
∂T Ri
∂(IN E Q )i to

∂T Ri
∂(K/L)i

and the sum of the variable components of

∂T Ri
∂(Ideology )i

and

diﬀer in sign. Otherwise, they are restricted to having the same sign.

Taking the partial derivative of T Ri with respect to Ideology i and IN EQi respectively, we
have
∂T Ri
∂T Ri
= α1 + α2 (K/L)i ,
= α3 + α4 (K/L)i
∂(Ideology)i
∂(INEQ)i

(2)

The prediction of the comparative static exercise summarized in proposition 1 is that α1 < 0 and
α2 > 0 such that α1 + α2 (K/L)i ≷ 0 as (K/L)i ≷ (K/L)∗ where (K/L)∗ = − α1 /α2 is the
turning point capital-labor ratio determined endogenously from the data, given our estimating
equation. Another requirement for the prediction to hold is that (K/L)∗ should lie within the
range of values of (K/L) in the dataset, i.e., (K/L)MIN < (K/L)∗ < (K/L)MAX . Similarly from
proposition 2, α3 < 0 and α4 > 0 such that α3 + α4 (K/L)i ≷ 0 as (K/L)i ≷ (K/L)∗∗ where
(K/L)∗∗ = − α3 /α4 is the turning point capital-labor ratio for inequality and again has to be
within the range of values of K/L in our dataset.
We perform Hausman tests to investigate the possible endogeneity of the capital-labor ratio
with respect to trade protection, as suggested by a two-sector Solow model. Also, our measures
of inequality are the income Gini-coeﬃcient and the median quintile’s share in national income or
6 We could not find any non-monotonicities with respect to K/L by including an additional term (K/L)2 . We
did not detect any non-linearities (at 15% and even higher levels of significance) in any of our variables when we
performed the Ramsey Reset test for all our regressions, both with and without controls.
7 In our estimation, we use the capital-labor ratios in natural logs (whose use results in very few outliers) and
not in levels (which result in a very large number of outliers).

expenditure, both of which are indirect measures of asset inequality (or equality) since they are
actually measures of income inequality.8

There is the possibility of reverse causation running

from trade policy to income inequality. Therefore, we also perform Hausman tests to check
for the endogeneity of inequality. The Hausman test suggests that endogeneity of the capital
labor ratio needs to be corrected for, which we do by performing two-stage least squares through
instrumentation of the capital-labor ratio and its interaction terms. The Hausman test does not
suggest any endogeneity problems associated with inequality and therefore, we do not provide any
estimation results based on instrumenting it.
Since it may be argued that democracies are more likely to be responsive to both generalinterest considerations (for votes) and to special-interest considerations (for campaign contributions) we then also investigate whether this model works better in democracies than in dictatorships.
Finally our component models can be written as follows:

T Ri = β 0 + β 1 Ideology i + β 2 Ideology i × (K/L)i + β 3 (K/L)i + ui

(3)

T Ri = γ 0 + γ 1 IN EQi + γ 2 IN EQi × (K/L)i + γ 3 (K/L)i + vi

(4)

The expected signs on the coeﬃcients of inequality, ideology and their interaction with the
capital-labor ratio (and the relationship among them) are the same as those in equation 1. Clearly,
equations (3) and (4) are special cases of (1) through restrictions put on additional variables to
equal zero. We compare these restricted models to the umbrella model using a variety of Bayesian
and non-Bayesian criteria.
8 The only measure of asset inequality on which cross-country data is available is the land-Gini. However, using
data on land-ownership inequality directly in our regressions is not very meaningful, especially in a Heckscher-Ohlin
framework.

Data Sources and Some Basic Statistics

Our dependent variable is trade protection and our independent variables of interest are a measure
of ideological orientation, inequality in income distribution, the capital-labor ratio, and indicators
for democracy and political rights. The analysis averages all variables for the decade of the
1980s. Data on income distribution are very sparse and available for only two or three years for
the majority of the countries in the decade of the 80s, which prevents us from running panel
regressions.
To test for the robustness of our results, we use a variety of trade policy measures: total import duties collected as a percentage of total imports (IMPORT DUTY), an average tariﬀ rate
calculated by weighing each import category by the fraction of trade in that category (TARIFF),
a coverage ratio for non-tariﬀ barriers to trade (QUOTA), an indirect measure of trade restrictions - the magnitude of trade flows relative to GDP, defined as (X + M )/GDP , and the newly
available Hiscox-Kastner measure. While IMPORT DUTY and (X + M )/GDP are taken from
the World Development Indicators, TARIFF and QUOTA (both available for only one point in
time for each country in the 80’s) are taken from Barro and Lee (1994) and the Hiscox-Kastner
measure of protection from Hiscox and Kastner (2002). Hiscox and Kastner have created two
alternative measures of protection using the importing-country-specific and time-specific eﬀects
in two versions of the gravity model, one being the standard gravity model and the other an
ammended one with relative factor endowment diﬀerentials being used as additional variables to
capture factor-proportions type eﬀects. In this paper, we present results using the Hiscox-Kastner
measure from their basic gravity model.9

The advantage of this measure is that it captures the

implicit protection through substitutes (including domestic policies adopted) of standard trade
policy measures that governments use once they have committed to tariﬀ levels in international
agreements. We certainly believe that even if trade policy is determined through multilateral
9

Results using the Hiscox-Kastner measure from their ammended model are qualitatively the same.

9

negotiations, domestic special-interest and general-interest considerations can be an important
determinant of what kind of trade policy a country commits to in these negotiations.10 For those
who do not buy this argument, the use of the Hiscox-Kastner measure will be useful.
The data on political orientation are obtained from the Database of Political Institutions (DPI)
(Beck et al, 2001) which is a large cross-country database of political institutions that covers 177
countries over 25 years, 1971-1995. We use the ideological orientation (‘Left’, ‘Center’ or ‘Right’)
of the chief executive (that of the chief executive’s party or when considered appropriate that of
the chief executive himself/herself) for political systems classified as presidential in the database,
that of the largest government party for systems classified as parliamentary, and the average of
these two orientations for systems classified as assembly-elected president.11 Cardinality tests fail
to reject the hypothesis that ideology can be treated as cardinal (See Dutt and Mitra (2002b) for
details). In light of the eﬃciency gains to treating ideology as cardinal, we recoded the ideological
orientation of the government of each country for each single year to reflect the extent to which
the relevant government authority can be classified as ‘leftist’ - left was coded as 3, center as 2
and right as 1. For the cross-sectional regressions, we take the average of this variable for the 80’s.
Therefore, our ideology variable in the regressions is best interpreted as the extent to which the
policy and decision-making authority can be considered left wing with higher numbers signifying
a more pro-labor orientation. Treating ideology as cardinal has the added advantage in that it
captures the variation in the proportion of years a country had regimes of various ideologies (which
ordinal variables would not).
To measure inequality we use the Gini-coeﬃcient which is a broader measure than the inter1 0 It can be argued that some countries in our sample may have committed to GATT bindings several years
earlier, and that for these countries domestic political considerations are irrelevant in determining trade policies.
Our analysis using the QUOTA measure, as well as the Hiscox-Kastner measure that captures other policies (such
as industrial, labor etc.) that can implicitly act as trade barriers, circumvents this criticism. Secondly, it turns
out that only for 8 countries in our dataset the GATT bindings would have been binding constraints, i.e., most
other countries either had not bound their tariﬀs by early 80’s or their actual tariﬀs were below their GATT
commitments. The countries for which past bindings would have mattered in the 1980’s are the US, Japan, Canada
and the members of the EU by the 1970’s. When we throw away these countries or use a dummy for them, our
results are qualitatively the same.

pretation of inequality used in the theoretical framework in section 2. As a robustness check, we
use Q3, the share of the third quintile in national income. This is an inverse measure of inequality
(or rather a measure of equality) and so the signs of the coeﬃcients of this variable and its interaction with K/L are expected to be the reverse of those obtained with the Gini coeﬃcient. These
data were obtained from Dollar and Kraay (2002) whose primary source is the UN-WIDER World
Income Inequality Database, which in turn, is a substantial extension of the income distribution
dataset constructed by Deininger and Squire (1996). The data on capital-labor ratios are obtained
from Easterly and Levine who use aggregate investment and depreciation data to construct capital
per worker series for 138 countries.12
For a measure of democracy, we use the Freedom House (Gastil) measure of democracy that
provides a subjective classification of countries on a scale of 1 to 7 on political rights, with higher
ratings signifying less freedom. Finally, as instruments, the additional variables used are the
natural logarithm of the savings rate and the population growth rate obtained from the World
Development Indicators. Note that the population growth rate and the savings rate are parameters in the Solow growth model in which the steady state per-capita capital stock is determined
endogenously.

Results
OLS Estimation Results from Umbrella and Stand-Alone Models

Table 1 reproduces the results from Dutt and Mitra (2002a) and Dutt and Mitra (2002b).13

As

we can see both the special-interest model (first 5 columns of table 1) and the general-interest
model (columns 6-10 in table 1) are individually supported. The critical capital-labor ratio ranges
1 2 We also tried the Easterly-Levine capital per worker data that uses disaggregate sectoral investment and
depreciation data to arrive at more accurate measures. However, the country coverage for the second measure is
much smaller resulting in very low degrees of freedom.
1 3 Note that the country coverage in this paper and Dutt and Mitra (2002a, 2002b) is diﬀerent for two reasons.
First, we use an updated version of the inequality dataset constructed by Deininger and Squire (1996). Second, we
only included those countries in our sample that had data on both political ideology and income inequality. This
facilitates comparison across models and circumvents any problem of sample-selection bias. Note that due to the
diﬀerent final datasets used, the results from the stand-alone models in this paper, though qualitatively extremely
similar to those in Dutt and Mitra (2002a, b), are quantitatively a little diﬀerent.

11

from 8.9 to 10.7 for the special-interest model and from 8.1 to 9.0 for the general-interest model.
Note that the critical capital-labor ratio is itself an estimate and has a standard error. For most of
our regressions, the 2 standard error confidence-interval around this estimate includes the median
and mean capital-labor ratios. While the models in table 1 as a whole are statistically significant,
for import duty and (X + M )/GDP the individual coeﬃcients on inequality and the interaction
term (in the general-interest model) are not significant.
We next turn to the umbrella model where we jointly estimate the significance of specialinterest and general-interest considerations in trade policy determination. The results are shown
in table 2. All our regression models as a whole are significant at the 5% level. As predicted,
across all measures of protection save import duty, we find that the variables relevant to the
special-interest model (left-wing ideology and its interaction with the capital-labor ratio) and the
variables relevant to the general-interest model (inequality and its interaction with the capitallabor ratio) are strongly significant. Further as predicted, we obtain negative signs on ideology and
inequality and positive signs on each of the interaction terms. For (X + M )/GDP - a measure
of openness - the signs are reversed and significant. We now obtain two critical capital-labor
ratios - one where the relationship between left-wing ideology and trade protection switches sign
and one where the relationship between inequality and trade protection switches from negative to
positive. The critical capital-labor ratio ranges from 8 to 11.2. As the table shows these critical
values are close to each other and include the median capital-labor ratio within the 2 standard
error confidence-interval. The R2 ranges from 0.17 in the case of quotas, to 0.47 for the HiscoxKastner measure. The results are the strongest and most robust for tariﬀs and quotas, which
are the most direct measures of trade restrictions and for the Hiscox-Kastner measure which also
captures implicit protection through domestic policy substitutes (in addition to explcit protection
through tariﬀ and non-tariﬀ trade barriers).

12

5.2

Model Comparisons: Umbrella vs. Stand-Alone Models

Next we examine whether the umbrella model is an improvement on the individual special-interest
and the general-interest models. First, the adjusted R2 is highest in the umbrella model for tariﬀs,
the Hiscox-Kastner measure and (X +M )/GDP . For import duty the adjusted R2 is highest in the
special-interest model as is the case for quotas even though the diﬀerence here between the adjusted
R2 of the special interest and the umbrella models is only 0.0019. Second, we run regressions of
the actual measure of trade policy on the predicted values of protection from the general- and
special-interest models thrown in together (run in levels and logs) and found both coeﬃcients
to be individually and jointly significant for all trade policy measures, except import-duty. This
suggests that the two individual models complement one another. Third, we see in table 2 that
for all measures of protection, both the ideology and inequality related variables are individually
significant. The joint F-test for the inequality-related variables (inequality and its interaction with
the capital-labor ratio, which are the additional variables of the general-interest model)) shows
that they are jointly significant for the Hiscox-Kastner measure and (X +M )/GDP , while the joint
test for the ideology-related variables (the additional variables of the special-interest model) shows
their joint significance for all protection measures except for import duty. What is remarkable here
is that for our most comprehensive measure of the protection, namely the Hiscox-Kastner measure,
both the joint tests show strong significance of additional variables from each of the stand-alone
models. Finally, we used the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC) as metrics for model selection (umbrella versus component models).14 We find
that AIC selects the umbrella model for tariﬀs, Hiscox-Kastner and (X + M )/GDP over each of
the stand-alone models whereas it selects the special-interest model over the umbrella model for
quotas and import-duty. The same is case for the BIC except that it selects the special-interest

between parsimony and goodness of fit. For example, the BIC penalises complexity relatively more than does the
AIC.

model in the case of tariﬀs as well.15 None of these criteria ever suggest that the general-interest
model is better than the umbrella.
On the whole, there seems to be strong evidence to reject the assertion that general-interest
considerations on their own can explain variations in protectionism. Special-interest considerations play a very strong role as well and the umbrella model always does better than the stand
alone general-interest model. However, when comparing the umbrella model to the special-interest
model, we find that support for the umbrella model is contingent on the measure of trade policy. For tariﬀs, the Hiscox-Kastner measure and (X + M )/GDP the umbrella model is strongly
favored while for quotas the special-interest model seems more appropriate. Given the individual
significance of the general-interest terms (inequality and inequality interacted with capital-labor
ratio), given that for a majority of the measures the umbrella model is preferred in terms of AIC
and BIC, and since there is no single best model selection criterion, we may conclude that the
special-interest and general-interest considerations are complementary in accounting for variations
in trade restrictions.16

5.3

Robustness Checks

First, we added political rights of Gastil as an independent variable to control for the extent
of democracy. This variable turns out to be insignificant and does not alter our earlier results
qualitatively.17 Second, we use an alternative measure of inequality - the share of the third quintile
(Q3) in national income. Since this is an inverse measure of inequality the signs predicted are the
reverse of those that we obtain from using the Gini coeﬃcient. In particular, we expect a positive
15

The adjusted R2 based on Amemiya’s Prediction Criterion selects the umbrella model for import duty, HiscoxKastner and (X + M)/GDP and the special-interest model for tariﬀs and quotas. This statistic penalizes R2 more
heavily than does the usual adjusted R2 for each additional degree of freedom used on the right-hand-side of the
equation.
1 6 It may be argued that in countries with high levels of inequality only left-wing governments get elected. This
would imply that the political ideology of the government is endogenous with respect to the level of inequality. We
failed to find support for such an argument: First, the correlation between left-wing ideology and income inequality
is only -0.1. Second, we regressed ideology on inequality, generated residuals and used these residuals as a proxy
for left-wing ideology in the umbrella model. Our results remain completely unaﬀected.
1 7 Using the Polity measure of democracy instead of the Gastil measure makes little diﬀerence given the high
correlation between them.

14

coeﬃcient on Q3 and a negative coeﬃcient on Q3 interacted with capital-labor ratio. We see from
table 3 that both special-interest and general-interest considerations significantly influence trade
policies in the predicted direction for tariﬀs, quotas and the Hiscox-Kastner measure, marginally
for (X + M )/GDP, but not for import duty. Even in the case of import duty, the model as a
whole is strongly significant and we are able to account for 36% of the variation in import duties
across countries. Further, we obtain critical capital-labor ratios that are indistinguishable from
those we obtained in table 2.
Third, in a dynamic context (for example in a multi-sector Solow model), the capital-labor
ratio may be endogenous with respect to trade policy. Protection, by aﬀecting the production
structure, can aﬀect accumulation and the steady state level of the capital stock. In fact, Hausman
test suggest the endogeneity of the capital-labor with respect to the measures of trade protection.
Therefore, we perform a two-stage, least-squares estimation where we instrument capital-labor
ratio by the log of the population growth rate and the log of the savings rate.18

We do not

instrument for inequality since the Hausman test indicates that the endogeneity of inequality is
not really a problem. As table 4 shows, across all measures of protection the prediction of both
models are supported. The relevant terms are all significant and the critical capital-labor ratios
are again very close to the mean and the median capital-labor ratios. More importantly, we see
that now for the import duty measure as well, we obtain support for the umbrella model. The
last row of table 4 provides the Basmann test of overidentifying restrictions which validates the
quality of our chosen instruments.
We again uses the AIC and BIC model selection criterion to compare the umbrella model with
each of the component models separately. Our results now unambiguously favor the umbrella
model - across all measures of protection and across model selection criteria the umbrella model
1 8 Hausman tests did not indicate any endogeneity problems for either of the interaction terms. For these
Hausman tests, we used ideology and inequality interacted with the saving and population growth rates as additional
instruments. In fact with the savings rate and the population growth rate and their interaction with inequality
and ideology, the estimating equation is overidentified, so that we were able to perform the appropriate tests for
overidentifying restrictions and confirm that our instruments are valid and of good quality.

15

is preferred to the special-interest model and to the general-interest model. Thus, once we control
for the endogeneity of the capital-labor ratio all ambiguity that we noted in the previous section
(when comparing the umbrella model to the special-interest model) is removed.

5.4

The Interaction of Special and General Interest Considerations

We already have evidence on the complementary nature of special and general interest concerns
in influencing trade policies. While both special-interest and general-interest considerations seem
to be significant in the formulation of trade policies, their relative importance may vary. If the
objective of a political party is to win elections, a way to do so is to simply adopt policies that are
favored by the median voter. While politicians may win elections partly because they advocate
popular policies, a successful campaign also requires money for advertising, polling and “get-thevote-out” eﬀorts. Thus contributions and support from core constituents may be indispensable,
so that partisan motives come into play. Therefore, the relative importance of the special-interest
and general-interest considerations will depend on the degree to which median voter and partisan
interests and identities coincide or are in conflict. In this section we investigate this issue in
greater detail. Our overall findings reinforce the complementary nature of special-interest and
general-interest politics in trade policy determination.
5.4.1

Special Interest Considerations in Countries with High vs.
Inequality

Low Levels of

We analyze whether special-interest concerns are more important in countries with high inequality
or in countries that have a more egalitarian distribution of income. Our intuition is that in
countries with very high-levels of inequality, governments must adopt the policies of the median
voter to ensure re-election or to prevent revolution.19 This will be true regardless of whether the
party in power is pro-labor or pro-capital in its ideological orientation. On the other hand, in
countries with low levels of inequality, special interest considerations will play a dominant role
19

See Acemoglu and Robinson (2001) as to why dictatorships may be responsive to majoritarian concerns. In
their paper, as inequality rises, dictators opt for redistributive policies in order to mitigate the risk of revolutions
and social unrest.

16

and we would expect the partisan model to have significantly greater explanatory power.
First, we partition the sample of countries into low-inequality and high-inequality countries
(based on the median Gini coeﬃcient) and estimate separate special-interest models for each of
these sub-samples. From table 5 we see that for the majority of the regressions, the special-interest
model has greater explanatory power and that the estimated coeﬃcients are individually as well as
jointly significant in countries with low levels of inequality. In contrast, the special-interest model
fares poorly in countries with high levels of inequality and the signs are not only insignificant but
in many cases, the estimated coeﬃcients have the wrong sign as well.
Next, we generate residuals from the special—interest regressions in table 1 and regress the
absolute values of these residuals on the inequality variable. These regressions show that for three
measures of trade policy (tariﬀ, quota, and the Hiscox-Kastner measure), the absolute residuals
are significantly higher in more unequal countries. Moreover, the predicted values of protection
using the coeﬃcient estimates from the same regressions have a much greater correlation with the
actual values for the low-inequality sample (Gini coeﬃcient less than 40). Across all measures of
protection, the correlations double or treble when we switch from the high-inequality to the lowinequality sample. Both findings suggest that the fit of the partisan model is superior in countries
with low levels of inequality.
5.4.2

General Interest Considerations in Countries with Pro-Labor vs. Pro-Capital
Governments

Next we test the eﬃcacy of the median voter models and evaluate its explanatory power separately
in countries where pro-labor governments are in power as opposed to countries where pro-capital
governments hold power. In countries with pro-labor governments in power, special-interest and
general-interest considerations overlap since the median voter is relatively labor-rich. On the other
hand, in countries where right-wing governments are in power the policymakers face a trade-oﬀ.
Policies that pander to their constituents (the capitalists) whom they depend upon for campaign
contributions and/or votes may alienate the majority (who are relatively rich in labor). This in

17

turn entails future losses in elections. This suggests that since left-wing governments pay greater
emphasis to the needs of labor groups, the median voter model will be a better fit in countries where
pro-labor governments are in power. However, it can also be argued that left-wing governments
who have already adopted pro-labor policies have less room to manoeuvre so that a unit increase in
inequality is likely to lead to a smaller adjustment in trade policies. Pro-capital governments whose
policies are further from that preferred by the labor-rich median voter have greater flexibility in
adjusting trade policies following an increase in inequality. We take an agnostic view on this issue
and pose it as an empirical question.
As table 6 shows, we find that the relevant coeﬃcients for the general-interest model are
significant for tariﬀs and (X+M )/GDP regardless of whether pro-labor or pro-capital governments
are in power. But for quotas and the Hiscox-Kastner measure, inequality and its interaction with
the capital-labor ratio is significant only when pro-labor governments are in power. We again
fail to find any significant eﬀect of inequality on import duties across countries regardless of
the government’s ideological orientation. Next we generate residuals from the general—interest
regressions in table 1 and regress the absolute values of these residuals on the ideology variable.
Only for (X + M )/GDP did we find that these residuals are significantly greater in pro-capital
countries. Finally, after generating predicted values from the general-interest regressions in table
1, we find that their correlation with actual protection in countries with pro-labor governments is
roughly similar to the correlation for countries with pro-capital governments.

20

To summarize, if a pro-labor government is in power, the welfare of the median voter coincides
with the partisan interests of the government. The weight of the evidence suggests that the
general-interest model is more significant and has marginally greater explanatory power in such
countries. On the other hand, when a right-wing government is in power, there is a conflict
between the government’s partisan interests and majoritarian concerns and the median voter
2 0 Only for the case of tariﬀs is the correlation between actual and predicted values higher in the pro-capital
sample (0.7) as compared to the pro-labor sample (0.46). However, the individual coeﬃcient estimates are significant
only in the pro-labor sample.

18

model’s predictive power seems to diminish.

5.5

The Role of Democracy

Next we investigate whether redistributive concerns, driven by special interest politics or generalinterest politics, are more important in democracies or in dictatorships. Democratic governments,
to ensure their re-election, may adopt policies that benefit the majority and their electoral base
(groups that provide large blocks of votes and/or provide campaign contributions). Dictatorships
on the other hand face few such incentives.
In order to investigate the relationship between redistributive concerns and the extent of democracy, we generate residuals from our umbrella model and then regress the absolute values of these
residuals on the democracy/dictatorship (political rights) variable. These regressions show that
for all our direct measures of trade protection (tariﬀ, quota, import duty, and Hiscox-Kastner
measure), the absolute residuals are higher for dictatorships. Next, we generate predicted values
of protection from the coeﬃcient estimates in table 2 and find that their correlation with the
actual values is considerably lower for the dictatorship sample (Gastil measure above 4) than for
the democracy sample (the rest). Both findings suggest that the umbrella model fits democracies
better.21

6

Conclusion

Trade policy depends on the extent to which the government wants to redistribute income as
well as on overall factor endowments and their distribution. In turn, the government’s desire to
redistribute income is dependent on asset distribution, an important determinant of the demand
for redistribution. This link between the extent of redistribution and asset distribution can easily
be demonstrated through the use of a median-voter type model, which captures the desire of in2 1 Using the Polity measure of democracy gives us identical results given its high correlation with the Gastil
measure. However, neither of these measures are significant if we add them to our regressions in Table 2. This
suggests that the extent of democracy matters less in determining the level of trade policy, but more in terms of
adding to the explanatory power of the 2 models under consideration here.

19

cumbents to be re-elected through the use of populist policies. This type of a model is essentially
a short-hand way of capturing the eﬀects of electoral competition. And finally, it captures the
idea that even dictators can survive only with the help of popular support. However, policy determination, to a large extent, is also driven by the partisan nature of the government, i.e., whether
it is pro-labor or pro-capital. Parties and governments have their own ideologies about whether to
promote growth by encouraging capital accumulation or to promote egalitarianism by protecting
labor interests. Further, since diﬀerent groups in society form constituents of and contribute to
diﬀerent parties, special-interest concerns also become important in policy determination. We find
simultaneous support for both aspects of politics in trade policy determination.
Using cross-country data on factor endowments, inequality and government orientation, we
find that, conditional on inequality, left-wing (pro-labor) governments will adopt more protectionist trade policies in capital-rich countries, but adopt more pro-trade policies in labor-rich
economies than right-wing (pro-capital) ones. Also, holding government orientation constant,
higher inequality is associated with higher protection in capital-abundant countries while it is
associated with lower protection in labor-abundant countries. These results hold simultaneously
within a unified econometric model of trade policy determination that simultaneously captures
special- and general-interest factors as determinants of protection within a two-factor, two-sector
Heckscher-Ohlin framework. Overall, using various Bayesian and non-Bayesian statistical tests,
we find strong support for using such an umbrella model over stand-alone special-interest or
general-interest models, especially when we control for the endogeneity of the capital-labor ratio with respect to the protectionism measures. Finally we show that the umbrella model works
better for democracies than for dictatorships, showing the greater relevance of both special- and
general-interest factors in democracies relative to dictatorships.
