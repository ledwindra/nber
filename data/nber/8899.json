    "abstract": "\n\nWe examine the recent increase in hospital advertising expenditures.  We first illustrate that the rise in hospital advertising has not been universal.  Large, not-for-profit, teaching hospitals have, by far, experienced the largest increase in spending.  Adjusting for size, for-profit hospitals over this period have actually decreased their marketing expenses.  This increase in advertising spending is best explained by managed care penetration.  There is a small and marginally significant relationship between increases in for-profit presence in hospital markets and an increase in advertising spending by the not-for-profit hospitals in those markets.\n\n",
