Measuring Changes in the Bilateral Technology Gaps between China, India and the U.S. 1979

ABSTRACT
Popular literature suggests a rapid narrowing of the technology gap between China and the U.S. based
on large percentage increases in Chinese patent applications, and equally large increases in college
registrants and completed PhDs (especially in sciences) in China in recent years. Little literature attempts
to measure the technology gap directly using estimates of country aggregate technologies. This gap
is usually thought to be smaller than differences in GDP per capita since the later reflect both differing
factor endowments and technology parameters. This paper assesses changes in China’s technology
gaps both with the U.S. and India between 1979 and 2008, comparing the technology level of these
economies using a CES production framework in which the technology gap is reflected in the change
of technology parameters. Our measure is related to but differs from the Malmquist index. We determine
the parameter values for country technology by using calibration procedures. Our calculations suggest
that the technology gap between China and the U.S. is significantly larger than that between India
and the U.S. for the period before 2008. The pairwise gaps between the U.S. and China, and the U.S.
and India remain large while narrowing at a slower rate than GDP per worker. Although China has
a higher growth rate of total factor productivity than India over the period, the bilateral technology
gap between China and India is still in India’s favor. India had higher income per worker than China
in the 1970’s, and China’s much more rapid physical and human capital accumulation has allowed
China to move ahead, but a bilateral technology gap remains.

1. Introduction
In this paper, we report calculations of the technology gaps between China and
the U.S. as well as China and India between 1979 and 2008 using a CES production
framework. A technology gap is defined as the difference in output using foreign
technology and domestic (or foreign) factors relative to output using domestic
technology and domestic (or foreign) factors. Our measure is related to but differs
from the Malmquist productivity index discussed by Caves, Christensen and Diewert
(1982a, 1982b). An advantage of using the technology gap measure instead of the
Malmquist productivity index is that our concept is flexible to the structure of the
aggregate production function, and can be conveniently generalized to include
technological improvements embodied in the production function besides the
multiplicative productivity factor (for example, technological improvements due to a
change in the substitution elasticity or factor-augmenting technological change in a
CES production function, or increasing returns to scale).
Our results suggest that although China has a higher growth rate of total factor
productivity than India over the period, the bilateral technology gap between China
and India is still in India’s favor. India had higher income per worker than China in
the 1970’s, and China’s much more rapid physical and human capital accumulation
has allowed China to move ahead, but a bilateral technology gap remains. Also, we
find that the technology gap between China and the U.S. is significantly larger than
that between India and the U.S. for the period before 2008. The pairwise gaps
between China and the U.S., and India and the U.S. remain large while narrowing at a

3

slower rate than GDP per worker.
The paper is organized as follows. We provide a brief background related to our
analysis in Section 2, and discuss the technology gap concept and the methodology
we apply in Section 3. We describe the data sets we use in Section 4, and present our
empirical results in Section 5. As a comparison, and also for robustness purposes, we
report technology gap calculations for the widely used Cobb-Douglas case in Section
6. We offer concluding remarks in Section 7.

2. Background
A major development in the world economy over the last quarter of the 20th
century has been strong economic growth and poverty reduction in both China and
India. The Penn World Tables show that the real GDP (or real GDP per worker) in
2008 was almost 14.6 (or 9.4) and 5.3 (or 2.9) times that in 1979 for China and India
respectively, while the same number for the U.S. was 2.3 (or 1.6). Figure 1 reports
indices of real GDP per worker for these three countries between 1979 and 2008 (year
of 1979=100). All of these data are in constant 2005 purchasing power parity dollars.

China and India’s large economic size combined with rapid growth has meant
that their economic rise has had large impacts on the global economy, although their
absolute income levels are still quite low (the real GDP per worker of China and India
in 2008 were about 12.9 and 9.2 percent of that of the U.S., respectively). Recent
literature analyzes China and India’s growing presence in the world economy (see
Wang, Medianu & Whalley (2011) for related discussion), and also conducts
comparative growth accounting studies for these two countries (see Herd &
5

Dougherty (2007) and Bosworth & Collins (2008), for example).
It is widely recognized that technology or efficiency is at least as important as
physical and human capital accumulation in explaining income differences across
different countries (Hall & Jones, 1999; Caselli, 2005). Since the Cobb-Douglas
specification is the most widely used for the aggregate production function,
differences in technology or efficiency across countries can be simplified as TFP
(Total Factor Productivity) differences, or in other words, can be summarized by the
multiplicative factor A. Howitt (2000) and Klenow & Rodríguez-Clare (2005) show
how large TFP differences can emerge in a world with slow technology diffusion from
advanced countries to other countries, while Hsieh & Klenow (2009) estimate the
effects of resource misallocation on China and India’s manufacturing TFP and find
that if capital and labor are hypothetically reallocated to equalize marginal products to
the extent observed in the U.S., the TFP could be boosted by 30%–50% in China and
by 40%–60% in India.
But as Caselli (2005) emphasizes, the Cobb-Douglas specification is key to the
literature explaining income differences across countries, and a generalization of the
TFP assumption from Cobb-Douglas to CES (constant elasticity of substitution)
specification can lead to major changes in results. Notably, there has been increasing
recent empirical evidence that rejects the (unitary-elasticity) Cobb-Douglas
specification in favor of CES (generally below unity substitution elasticity) aggregate
production functions (see Chirinko et al. (1999), Duffy & Papageorgiou (2000),
Chirinko (2008), and Klump et al. (2007, 2011), for example).

It is also noteworthy that China’s real GDP per worker did not surpass that of
India until the year 1998 to 2000 (as shown in Figure 2). We can conjecture naturally
that the more rapid accumulation of physical capital in China (as shown in Figure 3)
may suggest a lower technology level for China compared to that of India at least
before the middle of the 1990s.

3. Methodology
In this section we set out the methodology we use to measure the pairwise
technology gaps between China, India and the U.S. over time. We measure the
technology gap between two economies 1 and 2 in terms of the ratio between actual
output in economy 1 using economy 1’s technology and inputs, and hypothetical
output using economy 2’s technology with economy 1’s inputs. The roles of
economies 1 and 2 in such a comparison can be reversed to yield an alternative
pairwise measure. We assume that each of the two economies produce a single final
good Y with two factors, capital and labor. However, the two economies can have
different technologies in production, i.e., they may have different parameters in (or
even have different structures of) production function. They can also have different
factor endowments.
Specifically, we can write the production function as follows:

Yi  Fi Ki , Li 
Here, i  1,2

i  1,2

refer to the two different economies, and Fi

(1)
represents different

technologies for production.
We denote Ŷ1 as the actual output of economy 1, i.e., Ŷ1 is realized with
endowments K1 and L1 using its own technology of production F1 . Ŷ2 is defined
as the hypothetical output of economy 1 that it could produce with endowments K1
and L1 using the technology of economy 2, F2 . Thus we have:

Yˆ1  F1 K1, L1 

(2)

Yˆ2  F2 K1, L1 

(3)

8

We can then define the technology gap between economies 1 and 2 as the ratio of
hypothetical to actual output in economy 1:

ˆ
G12  Y2 ˆ
Y1

(4)

Correspondingly, we can also define Y1 as the hypothetical output of economy
2 that it produces with endowments K 2 and L2 using the technology in production

F1 , while Y2 is the actual output of economy 2 with endowments K 2 and L2
using its own technology, F2 . Thus we have:

Y1  F1 K 2 , L2 

(5)

Y2  F2 K 2 , L2 

(6)

And we can define the reverse technology gap as:

G21  Y2

(7)

Y1

Here i  1,2 refers to the two different economies, t is a time variable,  i is an
efficiency parameter, i is the rate of disembodied (or Hicks-neutral) technological
change,  i is the distribution parameter, and i is the substitution parameter. Then
from equations (2)-(3) and (5)-(6), we have:

We can thus calculate the technology gaps G12 and G21 as in equations (4) and (7).
Similarly, for the CES production function with factor-augmenting technological
change

and the Cobb-Douglas production function

(14)

we can also calculate the technology gaps G12 and G21 using equations (2)-(7).
Our definition of technology gaps is related to but differs from the Malmquist
productivity index, a widely used productivity measure developed by Caves,
Christensen and Diewert (CCD) (1982a, 1982b). An advantage of using the
technology gap measures G12

and G21

set out above rather than a Malmquist

productivity index is that our concept is flexible in the structure of the aggregate
production function, and can be conveniently generalized to include technological
improvements embodied in other parts of the production function besides the
multiplicative productivity factor Ait   i e

 i t

(for example, improvements due to a

change in the elasticity of substitution or factor-augmenting technological change in a
CES production function, or increasing returns to scale). It is also worthy of note that
if the aggregate production functions of the two economies [as equations (9)-(10) or
(11)-(12)] have the same values for parameters  i

and i , and only differ from

each other on the multiplicative productivity factor
technology gaps G12t

and G21t

can be simplified to

10

Ait   i ei t , then both the
A2t

A1t . As Bjurek (1996)

mentions, to establish a relationship between the productivity indices and the
corresponding Malmquist indices, CCD made the assumption that the underlying
technologies were translog with equal second-order parameters. Although CCD
(1982b) showed that their superlative index numbers could also be used to make
multilateral output, input and productivity comparisons, if we allow for different
assumptions on the production technologies, the productivity index might not be
expressed easily in terms of a quantity index.
For a CES production function with Hicks-neutral technological change as in
equation (8), or a CES function with factor-augmenting technological change as in
equation (13), the key issues in calculating the technology gap measures G12 and

G21 are how to parameterize the corresponding production functions by the observed
data of the two economies, and specifically, for the production function equation (8)
how to parameterize the two equations (9) and (12). Parameterization of the
production function and calculation of the technology gap measures G12 and G21
can be made using a variety of techniques. Earlier literature uses the Kmenta
approximation (Kmenta, 1967) or estimates a restricted translog function with
traditional econometric methods. Klump et al. (2007) estimate a supply-side system
for the U.S. economy using a normalized CES function with factor-augmenting
technological change. Henningsen & Henningsen (2011) offer an R-package to
estimate the CES function directly using different nonlinear optimization algorithms.
Luoma & Luoto (2010) estimate a normalized CES production function with
factor-augmenting technological change of the Finnish economy directly with

11

Bayesian approach.
However, estimation of restricted translog functions or utilization of the Kmenta
approximation has been proved unsuitable when the underlying CES function differs
from the Cobb-Douglas form (Thursby & Lovell, 1978; Henningsen & Henningsen,
2011). Results based on using nonlinear optimization techniques in many cases seem
not to be stable; while the estimation of the supply-side system presented by Klump et
al. (2007) encounters problems of data availability. As a result, the calibration
approach is now the more commonly used method in recent literature (Caselli, 2005).
Since we also compare results from different forms of production function (a
Cobb-Douglas function and a CES function with Hicks-neutral or factor-augmenting
technological change) or different values of the elasticity of substitution, considering
the number of experiments we report on in this paper, we adopt the calibration
approach.
We specify as our benchmark a CES production function with Hicks-neutral
technological change that also incorporates human capital. As in Caselli (2005), we
use a Hall and Jones’ (1999) formulation for human capital



Yit   i ei t  i Kit i  1  i hi t Li t 
where Kit



1

i 
i

is the aggregate capital stock of economy i

at time t , Lit

(15)

is the

corresponding number of workers, hit is their average human capital, and hit Lit can
be interpreted as the “quality adjusted” workforce.
In per-worker terms the production function (15) can be rewritten as



yit   i ei t  i kit i  1  i hi t


12



1

i 

(16)

where yit is the output per worker of economy i at time t , and kit 

Kit

Lit is

the corresponding capital-labor ratio.
Accordingly, the technology gaps at time t , G12t

and G21t , can also be

rewritten as

G12t 

G21t 
Here yˆ1t and yˆ 2t

yˆ 2t

y2t

yˆ1t

(17)

y1t

(18)

are actual and hypothetical output per worker of economy 1 at

time t , respectively; while y1t

and y2t

are hypothetical and actual output per

worker of economy 2 at time t , respectively [corresponding to equations (4) and (7)].
In order to calculate the technology gaps of interest here using a CES production
function with Hicks-neutral technological change as in equation (16), we need the
data sets for yit , kit and hit , and the value of the efficiency parameter  i , the rate
of technological change i , the distribution parameter  i , and the substitution
parameter i .

4. Data Sets for China, India and the U.S.
The data sets used in this paper combine variables from two different sources.
The first is Version 4.0 of the Extended Penn World Tables (EPWT version 4.0,
Marquetti & Foley, 2011). We extract from the EPWT Version 4.0 data set for the
countries we study data on labor productivity (output per worker yit , expressed in
real GDP per worker in chain indexed 2005 purchasing power parity dollars), and
capital-labor ratio (physical capital per worker kit , expressed in 2005 purchasing
power parity dollars). The EPWT Version 4.0 data set include time series for China
from 1965 to 2008, time series for India from 1963 to 2008, and those for the U.S.
from 1963 to 2009. We extract data from these sources for the period 1979 to 2008.
To construct data on human capital, we use Barro & Lee (2011) estimates of the
average years of schooling in the population over 15 years old (Barro & Lee v.1.2).
Data on the average years of schooling of China, India and the U.S. used here are
available online (at http:/www.barrolee.com/, Last Updated: 2011.09.04). Barro and
Lee’s (2011) data set has both the average years of schooling in the population over
15 and 25 years old. However, as Caselli (2005) suggests, the average years of
schooling in the population over 25 years old may be more appropriate for rich
countries with a large share of college graduates, but it may be less appropriate for
developing countries.
Following Caselli (2005), we turn these data into a measure of human capital
using the formula of Hall and Jones (1999):

h  e  s 
14

(19)

Where s is the average years of schooling, and  s  is a piecewise linear function
with slope 0.134 for s  4 , 0.101 for 4  s  8 , and 0.068 for s  8 . The Hall and
Jones’s (1999) measure involving the parameter values 0.134, 0.101, and 0.068 is
used here to accommodate the log-linearity in the wage-schooling relationship at the
country level consistent with the convexity of returns to education across countries.
Specifically, the function  s  can be written as:

for s  4
0.134  s

 s   0.134  4  0.101  s
for 4  s  8
0.134  4  0.101  4  0.068  s for s  8


(20)

Barro and Lee’s (2011) data set of average years of schooling s is available for
every five year period between 1950 and 2010. Since s changes slowly over time,
we treat s as invariant before new data is available, i.e., we apply the 1980 data of

s to the period 1980-1984, the 1985 data to the period 1985-1989, and so forth.
As is common in calibration exercises, besides data on yit , kit and hit , we
also need to determine the values of key technology parameters (the substitution
parameter i , the distribution parameter  i , the efficiency parameter  i , and the
rate of technological change i ).
Recent empirical evidence suggests that the U.S. and other developed economies
should be better represented by a CES aggregate production function with an
elasticity of substitution below unity rather than the unitary-elasticity Cobb-Douglas
specification (Chirinko, 2008; Klump et al., 2007, 2011). While according to Duffy &
Papageorgiou’s (2000) estimates, elasticity of substitution with human capital
adjusted labor could be lower than estimates without human capital. As a result, we
15

set as a benchmark the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor  i  0.8 ,
which gives a substitution parameter i  0.25 (also giving i 
The distribution parameter  i

i 1
).
i

in a CES aggregate production function [in

per-worker terms as in equation (16)] can be written as a function of the capital-labor
ratio kit , the average human capital index hit , the substitution parameter i , and the
capital share i . As in Caselli (2005), we assume that factor markets are competitive,
and for the aggregate CES function in equations (15) or (16) we have

i 

i kit  

i

i kit    1  i hit  
i

Since the distribution parameter  i

(21)

i

is a function of the two time series kit

(capital-labor ratio) and hit (the average human capital), in the calibration procedure
we can firstly calculate a series of  it , and then take  i as the geometric mean of
the series  it . Before calculating the country distribution parameters  i , we also
need the value of the capital share  i . For our benchmark situation, as elsewhere in
the literature (Caselli (2005) and Hsieh and Klenow (2009), for example), we use U.S.
data on the capital share for all the three country parameters  i . The long-run
average value is around 1/3, and we adopt this setting. Due to problems of data
quality and availability, we have not adopted the actual capital shares for China and
India. We will vary these parameters later in robustness analyses.
Given the values of the substitution parameters

i

and the distribution

parameters  i , we can then estimate the efficiency parameters  i and the rates of



kh
technological change i . Following Caselli (2005), we define yit  ikit i 1i hit

16

and rewrite equation (16) as

yit   i e i t  yitkh

(22)

or

yit
yitkh

 i e  t 
i

(23)

kh
It is noteworthy, however, that the values of the series yit and the distribution

parameters  i , and consequently the estimates of parameters  i
sensitive to the measurement (or unit) of time series kit
(the average human capital) and

yit

and i

are

(capital-labor ratio), hit

(output per worker). For consistency and

reliability, we normalize all the time series of yit , kit and hit by the corresponding
U.S. data in 1979.2 We also choose different years or different countries as reference
points. Both different reference points for the normalized CES function and different
measurements (or units) of time series for un-normalized CES function will change
and i . Results are, however, comparatively

the estimates of the parameters  i

more consistent with a normalized CES production function.
Following Klump & Saam (2008), for a reference point with y0 as output per
capita at k0 and h0 , we assume

i 



(24)
(25)

Where  0 is the capital share at the reference point, and  is a efficiency parameter.
With equations (24) and (25), we can then express equation (16) as
2

The normalized CES production function was introduced by La Grandville (1989) and advanced by Klump & de
La Grandville (2000), Klump & Preissler (2000) and Klump & Saam (2008), see Klump et al. (2011) for a recent
survey of the related literature.

procedure. The technology level index for the U.S. in 1979 is 1, as all the time series
of yit , kit and hit are normalized by the corresponding U.S. data in 1979. We can
see from Figure 4 that the rate of technological change in China is much higher than
India (as emphasized in literature on TFP growth rates), while the latter is still higher
than that of the U.S. However, while both the efficiency or technology levels of China
and India are much lower than that of the U.S., at least before the year 2008, the
technology level of India is higher than that of China. Although factor accumulation
rates in China exceed those of India, and economic growth rates in China also exceed
those of India, the technology gap is in favor of India before 2008 since the initial gap
is in India’s favor and closing more slowly than relative GDP growth rates.

Using the data presented in Figure 4, we can also parameterize equation (26) for
China, India and the U.S., respectively. Results are shown in Table 1. Since different
reference points or reference countries may have substantial impacts on the estimates,
for comparative purposes, we also give results using time series normalized by China
and India’s data in 1979. As shown in Table 1, estimated growth rates of technological
change i in China and India are close to the results of Herd & Dougherty (2007)
and Bosworth & Collins (2008). The estimated efficiency parameters  i* of the U.S.
are about 3.6, 4.5 or 4.9 times of India, and 8.0, 11.1 or 12.3 times of China, and those
of India are about 2.2, 2.4 or 2.5 times of China, when we use time series normalized
by the U.S., India or China’s data in 1979 respectively. It is also noteworthy that by
comparing estimates with different reference points, the results show that rates of
technological change i seem lower with a decrease in the efficiency parameters  i* .
Nevertheless, trends are similar as shown in Figure 4.

The technology gaps of China and India both with the U.S. and with each other

20

calculated using equations (17) and (18) are shown in Figure 5 [ ŷit

and yit

are

calculated from equation (26); the reference point is U.S. data in 1979]. These
calculations suggest that if China and India’s input factors were hypothetically used
with U.S. technology, the hypothetical output would be much larger; and if China’s
input factors were hypothetically used with India’s technology, the hypothetical
output would also be higher. Conversely, if U.S. inputs were hypothetically used with
China or India’s technology, the hypothetical output would be much lower; and if
India’s input factors were hypothetically used with China’s technology, the
hypothetical output would also be lower. Note that since we assume the aggregate
production functions of all the three economies [as equation (26)] have the same
values for parameters  i

and

i , and only differ from each other on the

multiplicative productivity factor Ait   i e

the technology gaps G12t and G21t are simplified to

Figure 5 also indicates that between 1979 and 2008, the technology gaps of
China and India relative to the U.S. decrease from about 7.79 and 3.59 to 3.86 and
3.37, respectively. These results confirm that the technology gap between China and
the U.S. is larger than that between India and the U.S., while both the gaps of China
and India narrow at a slower rate than GDP per worker (also consistent to the pattern
shown in Figure 4). The technology gap of China between 1979 and 2008 relative to
India decreases from 2.17 to 1.15. Since all the measures of the technology gap of
China relative to India over the period are greater than 1, the technology gap is in
favor of India before 2008 since the initial gap is in India’s favor. These trends of the
pairwise measures of technology gaps between China, India and the U.S. as shown in
Figure 5 are consistent with different estimated values for parameters of  i* and i
shown in Table 1, i.e., different reference points or reference countries do not change
the trends described here.
These findings are noteworthy, since recent literature emphasizes the much
higher growth rate of total factor productivity in China than in India, and misses
China’s comparatively lower technology level compared to India.

We use U.S. data on the capital share for  i again, i.e., we again use its long-run
average value i  1 / 3 (capital share  i is  0 in Table 1 at Section 5). Thus the
only difference between the Cobb-Douglas production function used here and
equation (26) used in Section 5 is the elasticity of substitution  i (or equivalently
the substitution parameter i ).

Figure 6 presents the indices of technology level Ait   i e

for China, India

and the U.S. between 1979 and 2008 calculated using equation (29), and also the
estimated parameters  i* and i derived from a standard curve fitting procedure,
with U.S. data of 1979 as the reference point (the efficiency level index of the U.S. in
1979 is 1). Comparing Figures 4 and 6, we can see that these two figures give similar
trends: the growth rate of technological change in China is higher than India, and the
latter is still higher than that of the U.S; while both the technology levels (measured
by the efficiency level indices in the figures) of China and India are much lower than
that of the U.S., the technology level of India is higher than that of China. Our
previous conclusion that the technology gap is in favor of India before 2008 since the
initial gap is in India’s favor still holds. The major difference between Figures 4 and 6
is that with a Cobb-Douglas production function, efficiency level indices are slightly
lower, and the rates of technological change are slightly higher for China and India
23

than that for the CES case in Section 5; while for the U.S., the contrary is true.

For comparative purposes, we also present results with different reference points
(China, India and U.S. data in 1979) in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, the estimated
growth rates of technological change i

in China and India are still close to the

results of Herd & Dougherty (2007) and Bosworth & Collins (2008). The estimated
values of efficiency parameters  i* of the U.S. are about 4.1 times of India and 10.1
times of China, and those of India are about 2.4 times of China. Data in Table 2 also
24

confirm that when the aggregate production function is Cobb-Douglas, different
reference points (for

yit

,

kit

times series (such as yit , kit

k0

and

hit

) or different measures (or units) of the

and hit ) only change the levels of the efficiency

parameters  i* , while having no effects on both the ratios of  i* and the values of

i .

The technology gaps of China and India both with the U.S. and with each other
calculated with a Cobb-Douglas aggregate production function are shown in Figure 7
[ ŷit

and yit

in equations (17) and (18) are calculated from equation (29); the

reference point is U.S. data in 1979]. Since we assume the Cobb-Douglas aggregate
production functions of all the three economies have the same values of capital share

 i , and only differ from each other in the multiplicative productivity factor
Ait   i ei t , both the technology gaps G12t and G21t are simplified to

A2t

A1t

. We

can see from Figure 7 that between 1979 and 2008, the technology gaps of China and
India relative to the U.S. decrease from about 9.78 and 4.10 to 3.84 and 3.53,
25

respectively. While the technology gap of China relative to India during the period
decreases from 2.38 to 1.09. Although the measures of the pairwise technology gaps
in Figure 7 change slightly compare to Figure 5, and the initial gaps in the
Cobb-Douglas scenario become larger, our previous conclusion still holds.
For robustness purposes, we now consider relaxing further the assumptions on
the elasticity of substitution  i and the capital share  0 (or  i ), and investigate
the variation of the estimated efficiency parameters  i* and the estimated rates of
technological change i

(hence the variation of the technology gaps) when the

elasticity of substitution  i

increases by a step of 0.1 from 0.3 to 1.2. Due to

problems of data quality or availability in China and India, we previously set the
capital share  0 (or  i ) of all the three countries at the U.S. long-run average value
1/3. Based on recent Chinese literature (see Zhang & Zhang (2010), for example), we
set the capital share  0 for China in an interval from 1/3 to 3/5. For comparative
purposes, we set the same interval for the capital share for India as well.

Results of sensitivity analysis on the parameters  i* and i to changes of the
elasticity of substitution  i and capital share  0 (or  i ) are shown in Table 3.
Results in Table 3 show that, for China and India, the efficiency parameters  i*
decrease, but the growth rates of technological change i increase with the elasticity
of substitution  i

from 0.3 to 1.2. For the U.S., the contrary is true. Further

experiments show that the reason the U.S. has a different relationship between  i*
and i is because it is set as a reference country. The capital share  0 (or  i )
presents quite different effects to the parameters  i* and i . We can see from Table
3 that independent of whether  i  0.8 or  i  1 , both for China and India,  i*
increases and i decreases when  0 (or  i ) increases from 1/3 to 3/5. Considering
differences in the initial gaps and the growth rates of technological change as shown
in Table 3, our previous inference on changes in the technology gaps of China and
27

India both with the U.S. and with each other seems robust.
Results of the technology gaps G12t and G21t for China relative to India using
different key parameters are shown in Table 4. Note that if the two economies have
different capital share  0 , then the technology gaps G12t and G21t may differ, and
can no longer be simplified to

A2t

. We can see from Table 4 that, with any
A1t

non-extreme values of key parameters elasticity of substitution  i and capital share

 0 (or  i ), at least before the year 2008, the technology gap of China relative to
India still remains in India’s favor.

7. Conclusion
Our paper reports calculations of the technology gaps for China and India
compared both to the U.S. and to each other between 1979 and 2008 using a CES
framework. These gaps reflect differences between actual output per worker and
hypothetical output using other countries’ technology with domestic inputs. By
comparing with the U.S., we investigate changes in the technology gaps between
China and India through time, and also make comparisons of the efficiency or
technology level of the two countries.
We find that the pairwise gaps between China and the U.S., and India and the
U.S. remain large while narrowing at a slower rate than GDP per worker. The
technology gap between China and the U.S. is significantly larger than that between
India and the U.S. for the period before 2008. Notably, the variations of China and
India’s technology gaps relative to the U.S. present different behavior. The technology
gap for China relative to the U.S. is narrowing much more rapidly than India. The
calculations we report here also suggest that although China has a much higher
growth rate of total factor productivity than India over the period, the bilateral
technology gap between China and India is still in India’s favor. India had higher
initial income per worker than China in the 1970’s, and China’s much more rapid
physical and human capital accumulation has allowed China to move ahead, but a
bilateral technology gap remains.
These findings are noteworthy, since it seems that in the existing literature little
attention is paid to the technology gap between China and India. Recent literature

30

seems more inclined to emphasize the much higher growth rate of total factor
productivity (or technological change) in China than that in India, and thus misses
China’s comparatively lower aggregate efficiency or technology level compared to
India.
