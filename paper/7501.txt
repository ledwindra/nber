ABSTRACT
This study examines the impact of unions on wages and employment using data from Uruguay in
a period where unions were banned (1973-1984), then legalized with tripartite bargaining (1984-1991)
followed by industry-wide or firm-specific bargaining (1992-1997). The relationship between wages and
employment shifted significantly across these periods as evidenced by

" Recursive residuals show structural shifts in five of six industries with the shifts coming at the
same time as the regime changes.

" Wages are exogenous to employment before 1985, but not afterwards.
" The wage elasticity and the employment-output elasticity fell sharply after 1984.
" Unions significantly raised wages in 1985-1992, but afterwards the change in bargaining
structure and increased openness led to concessions.

" Starting in 1985, workers in unionized industries were less likely to be laid off than workers
in nonunion industries.
