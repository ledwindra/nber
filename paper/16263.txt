ABSTRACT
We propose a latent variables approach within a present-value model to estimate the expected returns
and expected dividend growth rates of the aggregate stock market. This approach aggregates information
contained in the history of price-dividend ratios and dividend growth rates to predict future returns
and dividend growth rates. We find that returns and dividend growth rates are predictable with R-squared
values ranging from 8.2% to 8.9% for returns and 13.9% to 31.6% for dividend growth rates. Both
expected returns and expected dividend growth rates have a persistent component, but expected returns
are more persistent than expected dividend growth rates.

We propose a latent variables approach within a present-value model to estimate the
time series of expected returns and expected dividend growth rates of the aggregate stock
market. Specifically, we treat conditional expected returns and expected dividend growth
rates as latent variables that follow an exogenously specified time-series model, and we
combine this model with a Campbell and Shiller (1988) present-value model to derive the
implied dynamics of the price-dividend ratio. Then, using a Kalman filter to construct the
likelihood of our model, we estimate the parameters of the model by means of maximum
likelihood. We find that both expected returns and expected dividend growth rates are
time-varying and persistent, but expected returns are more persistent than expected
dividend growth rates. The filtered series for expected returns and expected dividend
growth rates are good predictors of realized returns and realized dividend growth rates,
with R2 values ranging from 8.2% to 8.9% for returns and 13.9% to 31.6% for dividend
growth rates.
We consider an annual model to ensure that the dividend growth predictability we
find is not simply driven by the seasonality in dividend payments.1 However, using an
annual dividend growth series implies that we need to take a stance on how dividends
received within a particular year are reinvested. Analogous to the way in which different
investment strategies lead to different risk-return properties of portfolio returns, different
reinvestment strategies for dividends within a year result in different dynamics of dividend
growth rates.2

We study two reinvestment strategies in detail.

First, we reinvest

dividends in a 30-day T-bill, which we call cash-reinvested dividends. Second, we reinvest
dividends in the aggregate stock market, which we refer to as market-reinvested dividends.
Market-reinvested dividends have been studied widely in the dividend-growth and returnforecasting literature.3 We find the reinvestment strategy to matter for the time-series
properties of dividend growth. For instance, the volatility of market-reinvested dividend
growth is twice as high as the volatility of cash-reinvested dividend growth. Within
our model, we derive the link between the time-series models of dividend growth rates

for different reinvestment strategies. This analysis demonstrates that if expected cashreinvested dividend growth follows a first-order autoregressive process, then expected
market-reinvested dividend growth has both a first-order autoregressive and a movingaverage component. This result is true even if market returns are white noise. Basically,
if last year’s market-reinvested dividend was inflated by a high market return, this does
not carry through to next year’s market-reinvested dividend because market returns are
white noise, unlike the underlying cash-reinvested dividend. Reinvesting dividends in the
market adds noise to the level of dividends, and an AR(1) plus noise is an ARMA(1,1).
The main assumptions we make in this paper concern the time-series properties for
expected returns and expected dividend growth rates, which are the primitives of our
model. We first consider first-order autoregressive processes for expected cash-reinvested
dividend growth and returns; we then derive the implied dynamics for expected marketreinvested dividend growth rates. Using this specification, we find that both returns
and dividend growth rates are predictable, regardless of the reinvestment strategy. We
can reject the null hypothesis that either expected returns or expected growth rates are
constant at conventional significance levels. Further, for both reinvestment strategies,
we find that expected returns are more persistent than expected growth rates using a
likelihood ratio test. Also, innovations to both processes are positively correlated. Finally,
while we find that future growth rates are predictable, most of the unconditional variance
in the price-dividend ratio stems from variation in discount rates, consistent with, for
instance, Campbell (1991). If we decompose the conditional variance of stock returns, we
find that cash flow news can account for 34.6% to 49.4% of this variance, discount rate
news accounts for 118.4% to 215.3%, and the remainder is attributable to the covariance
between cash flow and discount rate news.
Our model, in which we consider low-order autoregressive processes for expected
returns and expected dividend growth rates, admits an infinite-order VAR representation
in terms of dividend growth rates and price-dividend ratios.4 Cochrane (2008) rigorously
2

derives the link between our model in Section I and the VAR representation. This
insightful analysis also demonstrates why our approach can improve upon predictive
regressions that include only the current price-dividend ratio to predict future returns
and dividend growth rates. Our latent variables approach aggregates the whole history of
price-dividend ratios and dividend growth rates to estimate expected returns and expected
growth rates. This implies that we expand the information set that we use to predict
returns and dividend growth rates. However, instead of adding lags to a VAR model,
which would increase the number of parameters to be estimated, the latent variables
approach incorporates the information contained in the history of price-dividend ratios
and dividend growth rates while keeping the number of parameters low. As Cochrane
(2008) shows, our model introduces moving average terms of price-dividend ratios and
dividend growth rates, in addition to the current price-dividend ratios, and we find these
moving average terms to be relevant in predicting future returns and in particular dividend
growth rates.
The insight that return predictability and dividend growth rate predictability are best
studied jointly has been pointed out previously by Cochrane (2007), Fama and French
(1988), and Campbell and Shiller (1988). The main contribution of our paper is to model
expected returns and expected dividend growth rates as latent processes and use filtering
techniques to uncover them. Fama and French (1988) note that the price-dividend ratio
is a noisy proxy for expected returns when the price-dividend ratio also moves due to
expected dividend growth rate variation. This point is also made by Menzly, Santos, and
Veronesi (2004) and Goetzmann and Jorion (1995). However, the reverse argument also
holds: the price-dividend ratio is a noisy proxy for expected dividend growth when the
price-dividend ratio also moves due to expected return variation. Our framework explicitly
takes into account the fact that the price-dividend ratio can move due to expected return
variation or expected dividend growth rate variation, with the filtering procedure assigning
price-dividend ratio shocks to expected return shocks and/or expected dividend growth
3

rate shocks.
One may wonder why we choose an AR(1) process to model expected cash-reinvested
dividend growth as opposed to expected market-reinvested dividend growth.

Each

reinvestment strategy for dividends corresponds to a different time-series model for
expected returns and expected dividend growth rates. It could be the case that, in
fact, expected market-reinvested dividend growth is well described by an AR(1) process.
Given that most of the literature on return and dividend growth rate predictability focuses
on market-reinvested dividend growth rates, this might seem like a more sensible first
pass. In the Internet Appendix, we explore this alternative specification and find that
the persistence coefficient of expected market-reinvested dividend growth is negative.5
By fixing the parameter controlling the persistence of expected dividend growth in the
estimation of this specification, and maximizing over all other parameters, we show that
the model’s likelihood is bimodal. This suggests that a simple first-order autoregressive
process for expected market-reinvested dividend growth is too restrictive.

We next

perform a formal specification test and find that the model in Section I, in which expected
cash-reinvested dividend growth is an AR(1) process and expected market-reinvested
dividend growth is an ARMA(1,1) process, is preferred over a model in which expected
market-reinvested dividend growth is an AR(1) process.
Our paper is closely related to the recent literature on present-value models. In
particular, our paper is related to Cochrane (2007), Lettau and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008),
Pástor and Veronesi (2003, 2006), Pástor, Sinha, and Swaminathan (2008), Bekaert,
Engstrom, and Grenadier (2001, 2005), Burnside (1998), Ang and Liu (2004), and
Brennan and Xia (2005). All of these papers provide expressions for the price-dividend or
market-to-book ratio. However, in the case of Bekaert, Engstrom, and Grenadier (2001),
P/’astor and Veronesi (2003, 2006), Ang and Liu (2004), and Brennan and Xia (2005),
the price-dividend ratio is an infinite sum or indefinite integral of exponentially quadratic
terms, which makes likelihood-based estimation and filtering computationally much more
4

involved. Bekaert, Engstrom, and Grenadier (2001) and Ang and Liu (2004) estimate the
model by means of GMM and model expected returns and expected growth rates as an
affine function of a set of additional variables. Brennan and Xia (2005) use a two-step
procedure to estimate their model and use long-term forecasts for expected returns to
recover an estimate of the time series of (instantaneous) expected returns. Alternatively,
Lettau and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008) set up a linearized present-value model and recover
structural parameters from reduced-form estimators. They then test whether the presentvalue constraints are violated. The impose the condition, however, that the persistence
of expected returns and the persistence of expected growth rates are equal.6
Our paper also relates to Brandt and Kang (2004), Pástor and Stambaugh (2006),
and Rytchkov (2007), who focus on return predictability using filtering techniques. We
contribute to this literature by focusing on the interaction between return and dividend
growth predictability, and by showing that the reinvestment strategy of dividends has an
impact on the specification of the present-value model.
Further, our paper extends Chen (2009), who also discusses reinvestment strategies.
Chen (2009) points out that because a higher price-dividend ratio predicts either higher
future returns or lower future growth rates, the combined signal is blurred once stock
returns enter the calculation of dividends.

We show two additional implications of

reinvesting dividends in the aggregate stock market. First, this reinvestment strategy
adds an MA component to dividend growth if cash-reinvested dividend growth is an
AR(1) process. Second, the market return at time t forecasts market-reinvested dividend
growth from time t to t + 1. Thus, using our framework, we can explicitly account for the
reinvestment strategy of dividends in estimating the time series of expected returns and
expected dividend growth rates.
The paper proceeds as follows. In Section I, we present the linearized present-value
model. In Section II we discuss the data, our estimation procedure, and the link between
the two reinvestment strategies. In Section III we present our estimation results and
5

compare our empirical results to predictive regressions. Section IV discusses hypothesis
testing, including the tests for (the lack of) return and dividend growth rate predictability.
Section V discusses several additional implications and some robustness checks, and
Section VI concludes.

I. Present-value Model
In this section we present a log-linearized present-value model in the spirit of Campbell
and Shiller (1988).7 We assume that both expected returns and expected dividend growth
rates are latent variables. We first consider a specification in which both latent variables
are an AR(1) process.8 However, we can allow for higher-order VARMA representations
for these variables, some of which we explore below when we study different reinvestment
strategies.

and let ∆dt+1 denote the aggregate log dividend growth rate,

.

We model both expected returns (µt ) and expected dividend growth rates (gt ) as an AR(1)

process,
µt+1 = δ0 + δ1 (µt − δ0 ) + εµt+1 ,

(2)

gt+1 = γ0 + γ1 (gt − γ0 ) + εgt+1 ,

(3)

where

µt ≡ Et [rt+1 ] ,
gt ≡ Et [∆dt+1 ] .
The distribution of the shocks εµt+1 and εgt+1 will be specified shortly. The realized dividend
growth rate is equal to the expected dividend growth rate plus an orthogonal shock:

∆dt+1 = gt + εdt+1 .

Defining pdt ≡ log(P Dt ), we can write the log-linearized return as

rt+1 ' κ + ρpdt+1 + ∆dt+1 − pdt ,

where pd = E [pdt ], κ = log 1 + exp pd



− ρpd, and ρ =

exp(pd)
1+exp(pd)

, as in Campbell and

Shiller (1988). If we iterate this equation and use the AR(1) assumptions (2) and (3), it
follows that

pdt = A − B1 (µt − δ0 ) + B2 (gt − γ0 ) ,

where A =

(see Section IA.A in the Internet

Appendix). The log price-dividend ratio is linear in the expected return µt and the
expected dividend growth rate gt . The loading of the price-dividend ratio on expected
returns and expected dividend growth rates depends on the relative persistence of these
7

variables (δ1 versus γ1 ). The three shocks in the model, namely, shocks to expected
dividend growth rates (εgt+1 ), shocks to expected returns (εµt+1 ), and realized dividend
growth shocks (εdt+1 ), have mean zero and covariance matrix

Further, in the

maximum likelihood estimation procedure, we assume that the shocks are jointly normally
distributed.

II. Data and Estimation
A. Data
We obtain with-dividend and without-dividend monthly returns on the value-weighted
portfolio of all NYSE, Amex, and NASDAQ stocks for the period 1946 to 2007 from the
Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). We obtain data for the S&P500 index over
the same sample period from S&P Index Services. We use these data to construct our
annual data for aggregate dividends and prices. We consider two reinvestment strategies.
First, we consider dividends reinvested in 30-day T-bills and compute the corresponding
series for dividend growth, the price-dividend ratio, and returns. Data on the 30-day Tbill rate also come from CRSP. Second, we consider dividends reinvested in the aggregate
stock market (or the S&P500 index) and compute the corresponding series for dividend
growth, the price-dividend ratio, and returns. The latter reinvestment strategy, which
is commonly used in the return predictability literature, causes annual dividend growth
to be highly volatile with an annual unconditional volatility of 12.3% versus a volatility
of 6.2% for cash-reinvested dividend growth, as summarized in Table I and plotted in
8

Figure 1. In the next three subsections we present our estimation procedure. In Section
II.B we discuss our estimation procedure for the case in which dividends are reinvested
cash. Section II.C discusses the link between the two models. In Section II.D we discuss
our estimation procedure for the case in which dividends are reinvested in the market.

[TABLE I AND FIGURE I ABOUT HERE]

B. State-space Representation: Cash-reinvested Dividends

Our model features two latent state variables, µt and gt . We assume that each of these
is an AR(1) process. The de-meaned state variables are

µ̂t = µt − δ0 ,
ĝt = gt − γ0 .

The model has two transition equations,
ĝt+1 = γ1 ĝt + εgt+1 ,
µ̂t+1 = δ1 µ̂t + εµt+1 ,

and two measurement equations,

∆dt+1 = γ0 + ĝt + εdt+1 ,
pdt = A − B1 µ̂t + B2 ĝt .

Because the second measurement equation contains no error term, we can substitute the

9

equation for pdt into the transition equation for de-meaned expected returns to arrive at
our final system that has just one transition and two measurement equations:
ĝt+1 = γ1 ĝt + εgt+1 ,

(4)

∆dt+1 = γ0 + ĝt + εdt+1 ,

(5)

pdt+1 = (1 − δ1 ) A + B2 (γ1 − δ1 ) ĝt + δ1 pdt − B1 εµt+1 + B2 εgt+1 .

(6)

It may be surprising that there is no measurement equation for returns. However, the
measurement equation for dividend growth rates and the price-dividend ratio together
imply the measurement equation for returns. As all equations are linear, we can compute
the likelihood of the model using a Kalman filter (Hamilton (1994)). We then use
conditional maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) to estimate the vector of parameters:

Θ ≡ (γ0 , δ0 , γ1 , δ1 , σg , σµ , σd , ρgµ , ρgd , ρµd ) .

The details of this estimation procedure are described in Appendix A at the end of this
text. We use conditional maximum likelihood to facilitate the comparison with the
standard predictive regressions approach. We maximize the likelihood using simulated
annealing. This maximization algorithm is designed to search for the global maximum
(Goffe, Ferrier, and Rogers (1994)).

C. Reinvesting Dividends and Modeling Growth Rates

We assume that cash-reinvested expected growth rates are an AR(1) process. In
this section, we derive the observable implications for market-reinvested dividends. To
illustrate why the reinvestment strategy is potentially important for the time-series model
of dividend growth rates, we present the following extreme example. Consider the case in

10

which year t prices are recorded on December 31st and year t + 1 dividends are all paid
out one day later, on January 1st. Denote by Dt+1 the dividends paid out on January
1st. Assuming (for ease of exposition) that the one-year interest rate is zero, the endof-year cash-reinvested dividends are simply given by Dt+1 . However, the end-of-year
market-reinvested dividends are given by

M
Dt+1
= Dt+1 exp (rt+1 ) ,

where rt+1 denotes the aggregate stock market return defined in (1). Even though realized
dividend growth rates are strongly dependent on the reinvestment strategy, the aggregate
stock market return is not. The correlation between cum-dividend returns where dividends
M
are reinvested in the market, denoted by rt+1
, and cum-dividend returns where dividends

are reinvested at the risk-free rate, denoted by rt+1 , is 0.9999. As such, from an empirical
perspective, these two series can be used interchangeably. The observed market-reinvested
dividend growth rates are then given by

∆dM
t+1

= log



M
Dt+1
DtM



= log



Dt+1
Dt



+ rt+1 − rt .

This expression suggests that the lagged return on the market is a candidate predictor
of market-reinvested dividend growth rates where a high past return predicts low future
dividend growth. If the return on the market in period t is high, this increases the
dividend growth rate at time t, but it implies a lower dividend growth rate at time
t + 1 relative to cash-reinvested dividends. The expression above further suggests that
reinvesting dividends in the market can add substantial volatility to dividend growth
rates.
In reality, dividends are paid out throughout the year, for example, at the end of each
quarter. To capture the impact of reinvesting dividends in the aggregate stock market,

11

we consider the following reduced-form representation:

M
Dt+1
= Dt+1 exp(εM
t+1 ),

where Dt+1 denotes the cash-reinvested dividend. We assume that εM
t+1 is i.i.d. over time
with mean zero and standard deviation σM . Further, we allow for correlation between
εM
t+1 and aggregate market returns:

r
ρM = corr εM
t+1 , εt+1 ,
where εrt+1 ≡ rt+1 − µt ≈ −B1 ρεµt+1 + B2 ρεgt+1 + εdt+1 . In our previous example, in which
all dividends are paid out at the beginning of the year, this correlation is close to one and
rt+1 ≈ εM
t+1 . If dividend payments are made throughout the year, we expect a positive
value for ρM , but not necessarily close to one. Using this model, we can decompose εM
t+1
into a part that is correlated with εrt+1 and a part that is orthogonal to εrt+1 ,
M⊥
r
εM
t+1 = βM εt+1 + εt+1 ,

where βM = ρM σM /σr , σr =

p
⊥
r
var(εrt+1 ) and εM
t+1 is orthogonal to εt+1 . To keep the model

parsimonious, we assume that all correlation between εM
t+1 and the structural shocks in
our model, that is, εgt+1 , εµt+1 , and εdt+1 , comes via the aggregate market return. The latter
⊥ g
M⊥ d
M⊥ µ
assumption implies that cov(εM
t+1 , εt+1 ) = cov(εt+1 , εt+1 ) = cov(εt+1 , εt+1 ) = 0.

Given that expected growth rates for cash-reinvested dividends follow an AR(1)
process, we can derive the expected growth rate of market-reinvested dividends as follows:

M
M
∆dM
t+1 = ∆dt+1 + εt+1 − εt
M
= gt + εdt+1 + εM
t+1 − εt ,

12

M
where gt ≡ Et [∆dt+1 ]. This implies that gtM ≡ Et [∆dM
t+1 ] = gt − εt . The dynamics of

expected market-reinvested dividend growth are therefore given by

M
gt+1
= gt+1 − εM
t+1

= γ0 + γ1 (gt − γ0 ) + εgt+1 − εM
t+1
g
M
= γ0 + γ1 (gtM − γ0 ) + γ1 εM
t + εt+1 − εt+1 .

This shows that expected market-reinvested dividend growth is not a first-order
autoregressive process, but instead an ARMA(1,1) process.
Summary of the model: We can now summarize the model for market-reinvested
dividend growth as follows:

M
dM
∆dM
t+1 = gt + εt+1 ,
gM
M
gt+1
= γ0 + γ1 (gtM − γ0 ) + γ1 εM

t+1 ≡ εt+1 + εt+1 ,
g
M
εgM
t+1 ≡ εt+1 − εt+1 ,

M
and recall that gtM = gt − εM
t . Market-reinvested dividend growth rates ∆dt+1 are equal

to expected market-reinvested dividend growth rates gtM plus an orthogonal shock εdM
t+1 .
This orthogonal shock consists of two parts: one part is due to the unexpected change in
the payout of firms, εdt+1 , and the second part is related to the performance of the stock
market during the current year, εM
t+1 . The expected market-reinvested dividend growth

13

rate gtM also consists of two parts. The first part, gt , is driven by the expected change
in the payout of firms and the second part, εM
t , relates to the performance of the stock
market in the previous year. As gt is an AR(1) process, market-reinvested dividend growth
is an ARMA(1,1) process. Finally, the expected return continues to be an AR(1)-process
as in the case of cash-reinvested dividends.

D. State-space Representation: Market-reinvested Dividends

We define the two de-meaned state variables as

µt = δ0 + µ̂t ,
gt = γ0 + ĝt .

Again, the model has two transition equations,
ĝt+1 = γ1 ĝt + εgt+1 ,
µ̂t+1 = δ1 µ̂t + εµt+1 ,
14

and two measurement equations,

d

∆dM
t+1 = γ0 + ĝt + εt+1 + εt+1 − εt ,

We are now using dividends reinvested in the market to compute the log dividend growth
rate and the log price-dividend ratio. As before, we can substitute the price-dividend
ratio for one latent variable to arrive at a final system consisting of two measurement
equations and one transition equation:

(9)

As all equations are still linear, we can compute the likelihood of the model using the
Kalman filter, and use conditional MLE to estimate the parameters.

E. Identification

In our model, all but one of the parameters in the covariance matrix are identified.9
We choose to normalize the correlation between realized dividend growth shocks (εdt+1 )
and expected dividend growth shocks (εgt+1 ) to zero.

Table II shows the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters for the model
with cash-reinvested dividends (equations (4) to (6)) as well as the model with marketreinvested dividends (equations (7) to (9)).

[TABLE II ABOUT HERE]

For cash-reinvested dividends, we estimate the unconditional expected log return to be
δ0 = 9.0% and the unconditional expected log growth rate of dividends to be γ0 = 6.2%.
Further, we find expected returns to be highly persistent, consistent with Fama and
French (1988), Campbell and Cochrane (1999), Ferson, Sarkissian, and Simin (2003),
and Pástor and Stambaugh (2006), with an annual persistence coefficient (δ1 ) of 0.932.
The estimated persistence of expected dividend growth rates equals 0.354, which is less
than the estimated persistence of expected returns. We test whether this difference is
significant with a likelihood ratio test in Section IV. Further, shocks to expected returns
and expected dividend growth rates are positively correlated.10 In our state-space model,
we compute the R2 values for returns and dividend growth rates as (see also Harvey
(1989))

where var
ˆ is the sample variance, µFt is the filtered series for expected returns (µt ), and
gtF is the filtered series for expected dividend growth rates (gt ). Alternatively, we can
compute the R2 values within our model as if gt and µt are observed and do not need to
be filtered. However, to compare our results to OLS, we use the filtered series because
gt and µt are latent processes. The R2 value for returns is equal to 8.2% and that for
dividend growth rates it equal to 13.9%.

16

For market-reinvested dividends, we find δ0 = 8.6% and γ0 = 6.0%, which are slightly
lower than for the cash-reinvested case. Further, we find that the persistence coefficient
of expected returns (δ1 ) equals 0.957 and the persistence of expected dividend growth
rates equals 0.638, indicating, as before, that expected returns are more persistent than
expected dividend growth rates. Compared to the case of cash-reinvested dividends, we
find a higher correlation ρµg and a higher persistence coefficient γ1 . When we reinvest
dividends in the market, a high expected return will lead to a high expected growth rate.
This increases the correlation between expected returns and expected dividend growth
rates. Further, the part of the expected dividend growth rate that relates to the higher
expected return will be persistent, due the high persistence of expected returns. This
increases the estimated persistence coefficient of expected dividend growth.

where var

R2 value of 8.9% and for dividend growth rates, we find an R2 value of 31.6%. Further, the
M
standard deviation of the shock εM
t equals 5.4% and the correlation between εt and the

unexpected return on the aggregate market is ρM = 0.59. If all dividends were paid out
at the beginning of the year, εM
t would closely resemble the market return and we would
expect a standard deviation σM equal to that of the aggregate market and a correlation
close to one. If all dividend payments were instead paid out at the end of the year, we
would expect a value of σM close to zero and a correlation close to zero. For intermediate
cases, that is, if dividends are paid out throughout the year, as they are in our data set, we
find that σM and ρM above take values in between these two extreme cases. This suggests
17

that this reduced-form representation indeed captures, at least in part, the reinvestment
of dividends in the aggregate market.

B. Comparison with OLS Regressions

As a benchmark for our latent variables approach, we also report results from the
following predictive OLS regressions:11
rt+1 = αr + βr pdt + εr,OLS
t+1 ,
∆dt+1 = αd + βd pdt + εd,OLS
t+1 .

The results are summarized in Table III. For market-reinvested dividends, the return
regression has a predictive coefficient of βr = −0.10 with an R2 value of 7.96% and a
t-statistic of -2.19, where we use OLS standard errors to compute the t-statistic. The
dividend growth rate regression results in a predictive coefficient of βd = −0.04, with an
R2 value of 1.56% and a t-statistic of -0.91. The dividend growth rate regression has an
insignificant coefficient, which seems to have the wrong sign in the sense that a high pricedividend ratio predicts a low expected dividend growth rate as opposed to a high expected
dividend growth rate.12 Appendix B shows why our filtering approach can improve upon
predictive regressions. In addition to the lagged price-dividend ratio, we use the entire
history of dividend growth rates and price-dividend ratios to predict future growth rates
and returns:

where the coefficients and innovations (εd∗

filtering approach thus uses more information and aggregates this information in a
parsimonious way (see also Cochrane (2008)). The present-value approach we propose,
in combination with the Kalman filter, allows us therefore to expand the information set
without increasing the number of parameters.

TABLE III ABOUT HERE

For cash-reinvested dividends, the return regression has a predictive coefficient of βr =
−0.10 with an R2 value of 8.20% and a t-statistic of -2.32. The dividend growth rate
regression results in a predictive coefficient of βd = −0.01, with an R2 value of 0.01% and
a t-statistic of -0.91.
We have argued that the reinvestment strategy matters for realized dividend growth
and that market-reinvested dividend growth is more volatile than cash-reinvested dividend
growth due to the volatility of stock returns. Further, we have argued that apart from this
added volatility as a result of the reinvestment return, realized market-reinvested dividend
growth can be well described by an ARMA(1,1) process. To further explore this argument
we present results for several OLS regressions of market-reinvested dividends. The results
are summarized in Table IV. When we include in the regression a constant term and an
AR(1) term, we find a negative coefficient that is significant at the 10% level. The R2 is
low and equal to 5.0%. When we estimate an ARMA(1,1) process while controlling for
the lagged return (rt−1 ), we find an AR(1) coefficient of 0.559 and an MA(1) coefficient
of -0.569, both statistically significant. Further, the lagged return enters significantly, as
expected, with a negative coefficient of -0.378. The R2 of the latter regression equals
27.8%. In fact, including the lagged return as the sole regressor already leads to an R2 of
22.3%.13 The R2 of 27.8% is still lower than the 31.6% that we achieve by filtering, even
though the OLS regressions allow for an additional degree of freedom compared to the

19

specification for dividend growth in the filtering procedure. To increase the R2 further we
need to include the information contained in the price-dividend ratio, which in the OLS
regressions above we have not yet explored. However, including the lagged price-dividend
ratio in the regression does not lead to a higher R2 , the coefficient is not significant, and
the coefficient has the wrong sign, consistent with the OLS regression above where the
price-dividend ratio is the only regressor. This is not surprising. When the price-dividend
ratio moves both due to expected returns and expected dividend growth rates, the pricedividend ratio is a noisy proxy for expected dividend growth rates. Our filtering approach
explicitly takes into account the possibility that the price-dividend ratio also moves due
to expected return variation, which allows us to filter out the relevant expected dividend
growth rate information and achieve an R2 for dividend growth equal to 31.6%.

IV. Hypothesis Testing
Our estimates reveal several important properties of expected returns and expected
dividend growth rates. In particular, both expected returns and expected growth rates
appear to vary over time, expected returns appear to be more persistent than expected
growth rates, and both appear to contain a persistent component. In this section, we
perform a series of hypothesis tests to establish the statistical significance of these results.
Our likelihood-based estimation approach provides a straightforward way to address
these questions using the likelihood ratio (LR) test.

Denote the log-likelihood that

corresponds to the unconstrained model by L1 . The log-likelihood that follows from
estimating the model under the null hypothesis is denoted by L0 . The likelihood ratio

20

test statistic is then given by
LR = 2(L1 − L0 ),

which is asymptotically chi-squared distributed with degrees of freedom equal to the
number of constrained parameters. We perform our test for both market-reinvested
dividend growth rates and cash-reinvested dividend growth rates.
First, we test for a lack of return predictability. The associated null hypothesis is

H0 : δ1 = σµ = ρµg = ρµd = 0,
where the LR statistic has a χ24 -distribution. Under this null hypothesis, all variation in
the log price-dividend ratio comes from variation in expected growth rates. In this case,
we can uncover expected dividend growth rates through an OLS regression of dividend
growth rates on the lagged price-dividend ratio.
Second, we test for the lack of dividend growth rate predictability. The null hypothesis
that corresponds to this test for cash-reinvested dividends reads

H0 : γ1 = σg = ρµg = 0,
where the LR statistic follows a χ23 -distribution. If dividend growth is unpredictable,
we can uncover expected returns through an OLS regression of returns on the lagged
price-dividend ratio. For market-reinvested dividends, the null hypothesis is

H0 : γ1 = σg = ρµg = σM = ρM = 0,
where the LR statistic has a χ25 -distribution.

The absence of dividend growth

predictability also requires that σM and ρM be zero. If not, εM
t+1 correlates with returns
21

and forecasts subsequent dividend growth rates. Under this null hypothesis, all variation
in the log price-dividend ratio comes from variation in expected returns.
Third, we test whether the persistence coefficient of expected dividend growth rates
equals zero. The null hypothesis that corresponds to this test is

H0 : γ1 = 0,
where the LR statistic has a χ21 -distribution. The question of whether expected dividend
growth rates are time-varying, and what their persistence is, plays an important role in
general equilibrium models with long-run risk (Bansal and Yaron (2004) and Hansen,
Heaton, and Li (2008)).
Fourth, we test whether the persistence coefficients of expected dividend growth rates
and expected returns are equal, which has been assumed by Cochrane (2007) and Lettau
and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008) for analytical convenience. The null hypothesis for this
test is

H0 : γ1 = δ1 ,
where the LR statistic has a χ21 -distribution. Under the null hypothesis of equal persistence
coefficients, the price-dividend ratio is an AR(1) process, which has been used as a
reduced-form model by many authors.14 Under the alternative hypothesis, the pricedividend ratio is not an AR(1) process, as the sum of two AR(1) processes is an
ARMA(2,1) process.
Finally, we test whether the inclusion of εM
t adds significantly to the fit of the model.
The null hypotheses we test are

H0 : σM = 0,

22

and

H0 : ρM = 0.
In both cases, the LR statistic has a χ21 -distribution.
We summarize the LR statistics of all these tests in a table in the Internet Appendix.
The table also contains the critical values at the 5% and 1% significance levels for the χ2
with N degrees of freedom. The table shows that all the null hypotheses stated above can
be rejected at the 5% level. This suggests, in the context of our model, that both returns
and dividend growth rates are predictable. Furthermore, it seems that expected returns
are more persistent than expected dividend growth rates, given that (i) we find a lower
value of γ1 than for δ1 in our unconstrained estimates and (ii) the hypothesis that these
two coefficients are equal can be rejected at the 1% level. Finally, the inclusion of the term
εM
t in our specification for market-reinvested dividend growth seems to add significantly
to the fit of the model. The correlation between returns and εM
t is significantly different
from 0 and positive, lending further support to our interpretation of εM as a reduced-form
representation for reinvesting dividends in the market throughout the year.

V. Additional Results
A. Comparing the Filtered Series

In this section, we compare the filtered series for both expected returns and expected
dividend growth rates for both reinvestment strategies. In Figure 2, we plot the filtered
series for µt as well as the realized log return when dividends are reinvested in the risk-free
rate. We compare these series to the fitted return series from an OLS regression of realized
log returns on the lagged price-dividend ratio. The figure shows that the two expected
23

return series are almost identical, consistent with the comparable R2 values that we find
for both approaches. In Figure 3, we plot the same series when dividends are reinvested in
the market. In this case, the expected return series of our filtering procedure is different
from the OLS series. The filtered series is lower in the 1980s and higher by the end of the
1990s. Consequently, the OLS regression predicts a negative return in the 1990s, whereas
the filtered series remains positive.15

FIGURE II AND III ABOUT HERE

In Figure 4 we plot the filtered series for gt when dividends are reinvested in the
risk-free rate as well as the fitted value from an OLS regression of realized log dividend
growth rates (again reinvested in the risk-free rate) on the lagged price-dividend ratio.
The difference between the two series is large. The filtered series picks up much more of
the variation in realized dividend growth than the fitted values from the OLS regression
do. Further, it appears that expected dividend growth has a positive autocorrelation, but
its persistence is not as high as that of the price-dividend ratio. The price-dividend ratio
is mainly driven by expected returns, which are more persistent than expected dividend
growth rates, as we formally tested in Section IV. In Figure 5 we plot the same series, but
now for the reinvestment strategy that reinvests dividends in the market. The filtered
series picks up a large fraction of the variation in market-reinvested dividend growth
rates. This implies that a substantial fraction of market-reinvested dividend growth is
predictable.

B. Variance Decompositions

We now derive variance decompositions of both the price-dividend ratio and
unexpected returns in both models. The variance decomposition of the price-dividend
ratio for cash-reinvested dividends is given by
var(pdt ) = B12 var(µt ) + B22 var(gt ) − 2B1 B2 cov(µt , gt )
=

(B1 σµ )2 (B2 σg )2 2B1 B2 σgµ
+
−
.
1 − δ12
1 − γ12
1 − δ1 γ1

(10)

The first term, B12 var(µt ), represents the variation in the price-dividend ratio due to
discount rate variation. The second term, B22 var(gt ), measures the variation in the pricedividend ratio due to expected dividend growth rate variation. The last term measures the
covariation between these two components. For market-reinvested dividends, the variance
decomposition is given by




We include the variance due to εM
as part of expected dividend growth variation.

This enhances the comparison with cash-reinvested dividends because we can
now also summarize the decomposition using three terms:

variation due to

discount rates, B12 var(µt ), variation due to expected dividend growth variation,

var B2 gtM + (B2 − 1)εM
t , and the covariance between these two components. Table V
summarizes the results, where we use sample covariances and we standardize all terms
on the right-hand side of (10) and (11) by the left-hand side, so that the sum of the
terms is 100%. We find that for both reinvestment strategies, most of the variation in the

25

price-dividend ratio is related to expected return variation.

TABLE V ABOUT HERE

We decompose the variance of unexpected stock returns as in Campbell (1991). In the
case of cash-reinvested dividend growth rates, the unexpected return can be written as
rt+1 − µt = −ρB1 εµt+1 + ρB2 εgt+1 + εdt+1 .

(12)

We group the last two terms together to decompose the unexpected return into the
influence of discount rates, dividend growth variation, and the covariance between the
two. In the case of market-reinvested dividend growth rates, the unexpected return can
be written as16
rt+1 − µt = −ρB1 εµt+1 + ρB2 εgt+1 + εdt+1 + (1 − ρ)εM
t+1
dM
M
= −ρB1 εµt+1 + ρB2 εgM
t+1 + εt+1 + (B2 − 1) εt .

(13)

As before, we group all the terms after −ρB1 εµt+1 together and compute the influence of
discount rates, dividend growth rates, and the covariance between these two components.
In the results we report below, we use sample covariances and standardize all terms on
the right-hand side of equations (12) and (13) by the left-hand side, so that the sum of
the terms is 100%.
The variance decomposition of unexpected returns is quite different across
reinvestment strategies. This difference is caused by the difference in the correlation
between εµ and εg , which is higher in the case of market-reinvested dividends, and the
difference in the persistence of expected dividend growth rates, γ1 , which is higher in the
case of market-reinvested dividends. Finally, the decomposition of unexpected returns
suggests that dividend growth variation plays a significant role in explaining unexpected
26

returns.

C. S&P500 Index

In this section, we repeat our estimation for cash-reinvested dividends using data for
the S&P500 index.17 As before, we use monthly returns with and without dividends to
construct an annual dividend and price series. We reinvest dividends paid out throughout
the year in the risk-free rate. The estimation results are summarized in Table VI. While
the results are generally similar to the results in Table II, a first difference is that the
persistence of expected dividend growth rates is slightly higher using the S&P500 data,
with a value of 0.485. Second, the correlation between innovations to expected returns
and expected growth rates, ρµg , is a estimated to be higher with a value of 0.494, and
the correlation between innovations to expected returns and unexpected dividend shocks
is also estimated to be higher with a value of 0.853. Third, the R2 values for returns as
well as for dividend growth rates are higher using S&P500 data than the corresponding
numbers reported in Table II. The R2 for returns now equals 9.8% and the R2 for dividend
growth is 24.2%.

D. Out-of-Sample Predictability

The R2 values we have reported so far are in-sample measures of fit. To assess the
out-of-sample predictability of our model, we follow Campbell and Thompson (2008) and

27

Goyal and Welch (2006) and compute the mean squared error,

where µet is the filtered value of the expected return using only data up until time t to
filter and to estimate the parameters of the model. The denominator r t is the historical

mean of returns up until time t.
Similarly, we compute the out-of-sample mean squared error for dividend growth,

where get is the filtered value of the expected dividend growth rate using data up until

time t to filter and to estimate the parameters of the model. The denominator ∆dt is the
historical mean of dividend growth rates up until time t.
We start our out-of-sample computations in 1972. Using the data between 1946 and
1972 to compute the parameters of the model, we compute the expected return (expected
dividend growth rate) for 1973. We compare this prediction with the realized return
(dividend growth rate). We then use the data between 1946 and 1973 to compute the
parameters of the model and compute predictions for 1974. We proceed in this way up
until 2007.
The results are summarized in Table VII.

The table shows that our model

performs somewhat better than standard predictive regressions in terms of out-of-sample
predictability. Over this sample period, our model generates an out-of-sample mean
squared error of 1.1% for returns and 5.7% for dividend growth rates. For standard
predictive regressions, these numbers are -1.8% for returns and -5.6% for dividend growth

28

rates.

E. Robustness to Log-linearizations

In deriving the expression for the log price-dividend ratio in Section I, we use the
approximation to the log total stock return in equation (4). In Binsbergen and Koijen
(2010) we study a nonlinear present-value model within the class of linearity-inducing
models developed by Menzly, Santos, and Veronesi (2004) and generalized by Gabaix
(2009). Because the transition equation is nonlinear in this model, we use nonlinear
filtering techniques to estimate the time series of expected returns. More specifically,
we use an unscented Kalman filter (Julier and Uhlmann (1997)) and a particle filter.
We find that the main results that we report in this paper are not sensitive to the
linearization of log total stock returns. Both expected returns and expected growth
rates are persistent processes, but expected returns are more persistent than expected
growth rates. Innovations to expected returns and expected growth rates are positively
correlated, and we find that the filtered series are good predictors of future returns and
dividend growth rates.

VI. Conclusion
We propose a new approach to predictive regressions by assuming that conditional
expected returns and conditional expected dividend growth rates are latent, following an
exogenously specified ARMA model. We combine this model with a Campbell and Shiller
(1988) present-value model to derive the implied dynamics of the price-dividend ratio,
and use filtering techniques to uncover estimated series of expected returns and expected

29

dividend growth rates. The filtered series turn out to be good predictors for future returns
and for future dividend growth rates.
We find that the reinvestment strategy of dividends received within a particular year
can have a nonnegligible effect on dividend growth rates. For instance, if dividends are
reinvested in the aggregate stock market instead of the T-bill rate, the annual volatility
of dividend growth is twice as high. We provide a parsimonious model to relate the
two reinvestment strategies.

The model shows, for instance, that if cash-reinvested

expected growth rates are an AR(1) process, market-invested expected growth rates are
an ARMA(1,1) process.
Our likelihood setup allows for straightforward hypothesis testing using the likelihood
ratio test.

We can statistically reject the hypotheses that returns and dividend

growth rates are unpredictable or that they are not persistent. Further, we can reject
the hypothesis that expected returns and expected dividend growth rates are equally
persistent. Rather, we find that expected dividend growth rates are less persistent than
expected returns.

In this section we provide details on the Kalman filtering procedure of our model. The
discussion pertains to the general case in which dividends are reinvested in the market;
the other models considered in the paper are special cases of this general setup.

Appendix B. Wold Decomposition
Using the Kalman filter in Appendix A in stationary state (Kt = K), we can express
the filtered state in terms of historical growth rates and price-dividend ratios:

Xt|t = Xt|t−1 + K Yt − M0 − M1 Yt−1 − M2 Xt|t−1
= (I − KM2 ) Xt|t−1 + K (Yt − M0 − M1 Yt−1 )
= (I − KM2 ) F Xt−1|t−1 + K (Yt − M0 − M1 Yt−1 )
= ...
∞
X
=
[(I − KM2 ) F ]i K (Yt−i − M0 − M1 Yt−1−i ) .
i=0

Using the return definition, we have:
rt+1 = κ + ρpdt+1 + ∆dt+1 − pdt ,
which implies a representation in terms of price-dividend ratios and returns. The first
element of Xt is ĝt−1 = gt−1 − γ0 . Hence, it is more natural to think about Xt|t−1 :
Xt|t−1 = F Xt−1|t−1
∞
X
= F
[(I − KM2 ) F ]i K (Yt−1−i − M0 − M1 Yt−2−i ) ,
i=0

implying that the first element of Xt|t−1 equals ĝt−1|t−1 , the filtered value of expected
growth rates up to time t − 1. Using the expression for the log price-dividend ratio, we
obtain a similar representation for the filtered value of expected returns, µ̂t−1|t−1 :

µ̂t−1|t−1 = B1−1 pdt−1 − A − B2 ĝt−1|t−1 .

This system represents expected returns and expected growth rates as a function of lagged
growth rates and price-dividend ratios. Define εd∗
t ≡ ∆dt − γ0 − gt−1|t−1 . We obtain:
∆dt = γ0 + e01 Xt|t−1 + εd∗

Estimation Results
In the second and third columns, we present the estimation results of the present-value model in equations
(4) to (6) with cash-reinvested dividends. In the fourth and fifth columns, we present the estimation
results of the present-value model in equations (7) to (9) with market-reinvested dividends. The models
are estimated by conditional maximum likelihood using data between 1946 and 2007 on dividend growth
rates and the corresponding price-dividend ratio. Panel A presents the estimates of the coefficients
of the underlying processes (bootstrapped standard errors between parentheses). Panel B reports the
resulting coefficients of the present-value model (pdt = A − B1 (µt − δ0 ) + B2 (gt − γ0 )). The constants
A, B1 and B2 are nonlinear transformations of the underlying present-value parameters. Therefore, when
interpreting the standard errors, it should be taken into account that the distribution of these constants
is not symmetric. In Panel C we report the R2 values for returns and dividend growth rates.

Notes
1

See also Cochrane (1994) and Lettau and Ludvigson (2005).
For instance, the risk-return properties of the end-of-period capital will be different if an investor
allocates its capital to stocks instead of Treasury bonds. By the same token, the properties of dividend
growth rates depend on the reinvestment strategy chosen for dividends that are received within a
particular year.
3
See for instance Lettau and Ludvigson (2005), Cochrane (2007), and Lettau and Van Nieuwerburgh
(2008).
4
Pástor and Stambaugh (2006) show a similar result for return predictability. They abstract, however,
from dividend growth predictability and do not impose the present-value relationship.
5
The Internet Appendix is available on the Journal of Finance website at
http://www.afajof.org/supplements.asp.
6
Under these assumptions, no filtering is required to uncover expected returns and expected dividend
growth rates. We test, using a likelihood ratio test, whether the persistence of expected returns and
expected dividend growth rates is equal, and we reject this hypothesis.
7
Cochrane (1991, 2007), and Lettau and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008) present a version of this model
in which it is assumed that expected growth rates are constant, or that expected returns are equally
persistent as expected growth rates.
8
Many authors have argued that expected returns are likely to be persistent, including Fama and
French (1988), Campbell and Cochrane (1999), Ferson, Sarkissian, and Simin (2003), and Pástor and
Stambaugh (2006). Further, it has been argued that expected dividend growth rates have a persistent
component; see, for example, Bansal and Yaron (2004), Menzly, Santos, and Veronesi (2004), and Lettau
and Ludvigson (2005).
9
See also Cochrane (2008) and Rytchkov (2007).
10
This is consistent with Menzly, Santos, and Veronesi (2004) and Lettau and Ludvigson (2005).
11
These regressions have been studied widely in the literature. An incomplete list of references includes
Cochrane (2007), Lettau and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008), and Stambaugh (1999).
12
Given that for values of γ1 smaller than 1/ρ, the coefficient B2 is greater than zero, we might expect
a positive sign in this regression. However, the price-dividend ratio is a noisy proxy for expected dividend
growth rates when the price-dividend ratio also moves due to expected return variation, which can lead
to the wrong sign in the regression. Binsbergen and Koijen (2010) show that the price-dividend ratio
σ2
σµg
1
relates negatively to expected growth rates if 1−γg 2 < B
B2 1−γ1 δ1 .
1
13
Fama and French (1988) add up dividends throughout the year, which is close to our cash-reinvested
dividend reinvestment strategy. They find that dividend growth rates are positively correlated with past
returns. When dividends are reinvested in the market, this induces a negative correlation that more than
offsets the positive correlation found by Fama and French (1988).
14
See for example Stambaugh (1999), Lewellen (2004), and Lettau and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008).
15
Campbell and Thompson (2008) suggest to impose that the equity risk premium be restricted to
always be positive in predictive regressions, which, as they show, enhances the out-of-sample predictability
of stock returns.
16
The first of these two equations illustrates why the quantitative influence of εM
t+1 on unexpected
returns is negligible: it is premultiplied by 1 − ρ, which equals 0.032. In the variance decomposition, the
contribution of the term is less than 1%.

Ang and Bekaert (2007) also use S&P500 data in their analysis of return predictability.

IA.B Finite-sample Properties
For this section, we analyze the finite-sample properties of our maximum likelihood
estimators.

We focus on the model for cash-reinvested dividends in Section I.
2

We

simulate 1,000 samples with the same number of observations as in the data, starting
with a draw from the unconditional distribution of the state variables. We use the point
estimates of Table II in the simulation. We subsequently estimate the model for each of
the simulated samples. Table IA.I reports the true parameters along with the average,
standard deviation, and quantiles of the distribution of 1,000 parameter estimates in Panel
A. Panel B reports the correlation between the parameter estimates.
Panel A shows that δ1 is somewhat downward biased, while γ1 is upward biased. This
corresponds to an upward bias in σµ and a downward bias in σg . Further, it appears
that the correlation between expected returns and unexpected growth rates, ρµd , is not
estimated precisely. Panel B shows that the estimates for the persistence of expected
returns (δ1 ) and the persistence of expected growth rates (γ1 ) are negatively correlated.
Also, we find the persistence parameters and the conditional volatility parameters to be
negatively correlated (e.g., δ1 and σµ ).
[Table IA.VIII about here]

IA.C Reinvestment Strategy and Model Specification
In the main article, we assume that the conditional expected dividend growth rate
is an AR(1) process if dividends are reinvested in the risk-free rate. We subsequently
derive the implied dynamics for market-reinvested dividends. We stress again that there
is a present-value model for each reinvestment strategy of dividends, reflected in the timeseries properties of expected returns and expected dividend growth rates. We now consider
the present-value model in equations (4) to (6) for market-reinvested dividends instead
of cash-reinvested dividends. That is, we estimate an alternative specification in which
expected growth rates of market-reinvested dividends are modeled as an AR(1) process.
The parameter estimates of this model are presented in Table IA.II. The table shows that
the estimated value of γ1 is not only lower than in the model in which cash-reinvested
expected dividend growth is an AR(1) process, but it is in fact estimated to be negative.
Despite this negative value for γ1 , we still find relatively high R2 values for both returns
and dividend growth rates.
[Table IA.IX about here]
To further explore this evidence of a negative estimated value for γ1 in this model, we
construct a grid of possible levels of γ1 . For each point in the grid, we optimize over the
other parameters and record the associated likelihoods and parameter estimates, as shown
in Table IA.III. The main results are summarized in Panel A of Figure IA. 1, where we
3

plot the likelihood as a function of γ1 . The picture shows that the likelihood has two
peaks, of which one is positive; the other is negative. Panels B and C show plots of the
R-squared values for returns and dividend growth rates as a function of γ1 . The R2 value
for dividend growth rates also exhibits a bimodel shape, and perhaps surprisingly, the R2
value is higher for the positive root than for the negative root of γ1 . Furthermore, the R2
value for returns is also higher for the positive root of γ1 . The figures therefore illustrate
that maximizing R2 values is not necessarily equivalent to maximizing the likelihood.18

We present the estimation results of the present-value model in equations (4) to (6) using
market-reinvested dividend data. The model is estimated by conditional maximum likelihood using
data from 1946 to 2007 on the dividend growth rate and the price-dividend ratio. Panel A presents the
estimates of the coefficients of the underlying processes (bootstrapped standard errors in parentheses).
Panel B reports the resulting coefficients of the present-value model
(pdt = A − B1 (µt − δ0 ) + B2 (gt − γ0 )). These parameters are non-linear transformations of the original
present-value parameters. When interpreting the standard errors, it should be taken into account that
the distribution of the coefficients is not symmetric. In Panel C we report the R2 values for returns and
dividend growth rates.

In the column ”> 0” we report the maximum likelihood estimates of equations (4) to (6), but using dividends that are reinvested in the market. In the first column, we impose
the condition that the persistence coefficient of expected dividend growth rates be positive. We then define a grid for γ1 between -0.9 and 0.8 with increments of 0.1, and
compute for each of these values of γ1 the likelihood while optimizing over all the other parameters.

The graph plots the log likelihood and the R2 values as a function of the persistence of

data where dividends are reinvested in the aggregate market. We define a grid for γ1
between -0.9 and 0.9 with step size 0.1, and compute for each of these grid points the
likelihood and R2 values of the model while optimizing over all the other parameters.

We report the LR statistics for the tests described in Section IV; in particular, we report the results for the first four tests for the two specifications that we explore in this
paper. “Cash” refers to the system in equations (4)to(6) using the data where dividends are reinvested at the risk-free rate. “Market” refers to the system in equations
(7)to(9) using the data where dividends are reinvested in the aggregate stock market. Two asterisks (**) denotes that we reject the hypothesis at the 5% level and three
asterisks (***) indicates that we reject the hypothesis at the 1% level. The critical values for the χ2 statistic at the five percent level are given by 3.841, 5.991, 7.815, 9.488,
and 11.070 for degrees of freedom equal to 1,2...,5, respectively. These five critical values are equal to 6.635, 9.210, 11.345, 13.277, and 15.086 for the 1% level.
