Consistent with the theoretical predictions of Katz (1986) and others, we find consortium outcomes are positively associated with the level of potential R&D spillovers within the consortium and (weakly) negatively associated with the degree of product market competition among consortium members.  Furthermore, our evidence suggests that consortia are most effective when they focus on basic research.\n\n",
