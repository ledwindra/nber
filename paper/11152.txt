Anticipating Artisitic Success (or, How to Beat the Art Market): Lessons from History

JEL No. J4
ABSTRACT
The recent history of modern art provides clues as to how important artists can be identified before
their work becomes generally known. Advanced art has been dominated by conceptual innovators
since the late 1950s, and the importance of formal art education in the training of leading artists has
also increased during this period. A few schools have been particularly prominent. Auction market
records reveal that during the past five decades the Yale School of Art has produced a series of
graduates who have achieved great success commercially as well as critically. Recognizing Yale’s
role can allow collectors to identify important artists before they become widely recognized, and
therefore before their early innovative work rises in value.

As Picasso later told me, very correctly, “In order for paintings to
be sold at high prices, they must first have been sold very cheaply.”
Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, 19611
Artists - not dealers, collectors, or writers - are the best guide to
what is going on in the art world.
Anthony Haden-Guest, 19962
Contact with like-minded painters - a group means a great deal to
me: nothing comes in isolation. We have worked out our problems
largely by talking them through.

The main stimulus was that Yale had the funding to invite people
from New York: artists who were younger, artists who were
making their mark at that time. It was good exposure to the
technical aspects of art and at the same time to the actuality of what
was happening. I probably couldn’t have gotten that so rapidly had
I just come to New York and tried to learn how to make art on my
own.
Nancy Graves, 19725
In November 1895, Paul Cézanne had his first one-man exhibition, at the Paris gallery of
Ambroise Vollard. Camille Pissarro, who had tutored Cézanne in the techniques of
Impressionism two decades earlier, marvelled at his former student’s progress, writing to his son
Lucien that in Cézanne’s show “there were exquisite things, still lifes of irreproachable
perfection, others much worked on and yet unfinished, of even greater beauty.” Although the
paintings were modestly priced at about 400 francs each, few were sold, and Pissarro complained
to his son of the blindness of collectors: “You wouldn’t believe how difficult it is for me to make
certain collectors, who are friends of the impressionists, understand how precious Cézanne’s

4
qualities are. I suppose centuries will pass before these are appreciated.” The lack of
perceptiveness did not extend to Pissarro’s fellow Impressionists, however, as he reported that
“my enthusiasm was nothing compared to Renoir’s. Degas himself is seduced by the charm of
this refined savage, Monet, all of us.” Degas, Monet, and Pissarro all bought paintings from the
show; Degas and Renoir both wanted to buy the same still life of fruit, and drew straws to
determine who would get it.6
Although Pissarro despaired at the defective sensibilities of collectors, in the event it did
not take centuries for Cézanne’s work to be widely appreciated. In 1899 one of his paintings sold
at auction for 4,400 francs; in 1913 Vollard sold another for 25,000 francs; and in 1925 yet
another sold at auction for 528,000 francs.7
Cézanne’s case was not exceptional, but in fact was typical of the experience of many
important artists in the modern era in at least two significant respects. Thus not only did the value
of his work rise rapidly after a major gallery show, but the quality of Cézanne’s art was
recognized by his peers, the other important advanced artists of his generation, before it was
appreciated by collectors.8 Recognizing these facts can help us understand how collectors might
beat the art market today.
Studies by economists have shown that the rate of return to owning fine art is generally
not higher than, and is more often below, the return to holding financial assets.9 But these studies
have all been based on the results of auctions. Auctions are not a primary market for art: newlymade art has rarely been sold at auction, and the work of unknown artists is not sold at auction.10
The art included in the data sets that have been used to calculate rates of return has consequently
been restricted to works made by artists who have established reputations, and to works that have

5
been sold at least once before. In view of this, many dealers respond to the pessimistic warnings
of economists about the dangers of investing in art by pointing to the potential gains to collectors
from buying the work of important artists before they are widely recognized, and therefore before
their work is included in auctions. Some of their examples have assumed almost mythic status: a
collector who had bought one of Jasper Johns’ flag or target paintings at his first show at Leo
Castelli’s gallery in 1958, or works by Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, or
Andy Warhol from their first New York shows in the late ‘50s and early ‘60s, would have seen
an initial investment of hundreds of dollars grow into millions of dollars today.11
The practical problem of acting on these dealers’ advice arises when we ask which artists
to buy, for there are hundreds of thousands of unknown artists currently working just in the
United States, and only a handful are likely to become important in the future.12 Faced with this
objection, art dealers will typically declare that this decision is a matter of taste - we should trust
our own judgment about which of the unknowns will become great artists, or perhaps even better,
we should trust the judgment of the dealers. So for example Andre Emmerich, one of the most
eminent dealers active today, recently declared that “Art has much more to do with gut than with
anything else.”13
The experience of Cézanne, however, can point toward an alternative strategy for
selecting artists. For it suggests that artists can help us to identify important artists before they are
widely recognized.
Sir Alan Bowness, a former director of the Tate Gallery, has argued that there is a clear
and regular progression by which important artists become generally recognized. In Bowness’
scheme, every great modern artist passes through four successive circles of recognition on his

6
way to fame. The first circle is peer recognition, as the very first people to perceive an
14

important artist are other artists of his own generation. The second stage of recognition is from
critics, who begin to explain the great artist’s innovations to a wider audience. Critical
recognition soon brings the attention of dealers, the third stage of Bowness’ scheme. And finally,
in the fourth stage, public acclaim makes the artist genuinely famous.15
Bowness’ scheme suggests a systematic approach to beating the art market. The
collector’s goal is to identify important artists before other collectors do. Bowness’ model
suggests that he can do this by talking to artists: if artists are always the first to recognize their
talented peers, the collector can seek artists’ advice on whose work he should buy.
In today’s art world, however, an immediate difficulty arises, due to the popularity of art
as an occupation. For as noted earlier, in the United States there are vast numbers of unknown
artists. Any one of these might be able to tell a collector which of the others in his immediate
circle of fellow artists he most admires, but there is a very small probability that any of the artists
in any particular group is likely to gain any commercial success. How can we tell which group of
unknowns is likely to produce a great artist?
Understanding the nature of contemporary advanced art can help us begin to narrow the
search. Recent research has demonstrated that great artists have produced the innovations that
have made them great in two very different ways. Experimental artists work with visual goals,
and proceed by trial and error. Their innovations typically emerge gradually, and they usually
make their greatest work late in their careers. In contrast, conceptual artists innovate by
formulating new ideas. Their innovations appear suddenly, and their most important
contributions are usually made early in their careers.16

7
Both of these types of innovator have figured prominently in the history of modern art,
but just one of them has dominated advanced American art since the 1960s. Thus ever since the
conceptual breakthroughs of Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg in the late 1950s, and the
subsequent conceptual innovations of Frank Stella, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and others
in the early ‘60s, conceptual innovators have overwhelmingly held the leading positions in
advanced American art.17 Recognizing that advanced art currently remains in a conceptual phase
helps us narrow our search for the successful artist of the future, for it suggests that we should be
looking for young artists, within the first decade of their careers, who are now making the
innovative work that will be highly valued in 10 or 20 years.
Although this narrows our search somewhat, it still leaves us with an impractically large
number of candidates, for there are many thousands of young aspiring artists in the United States.
Yet once again Sir Alan Bowness can help us narrow our field. In the same study mentioned
above, he remarked that “It is striking how often new beginnings in modern art arise out of ...
early conjunctions of outstanding talents.”18 In fact, since the time of the Impressionists, great
artists have almost without exception emerged from groups of artists working together, on
problems of common interest. These groups can be relatively large - like the Impressionists, the
Fauves, the Surrealists, or the Abstract Expressionists - or small - Picasso and Braque, Johns and
Rauschenberg - but whatever their size, they appear to be a critical part of a modern artist’s
development. Collectors who have discovered these groups before their members have become
famous have often been celebrated by art historians (prominent examples include Gustave
Caillebotte and Gertrude Stein), and they have also normally become wealthy from their
purchases of these artists’ work.

8
During the first century of modern art, from the Impressionists in the 1860s through the
Abstract Expressionists in the 1950s, these groups were constituted informally. Collectors who
wanted to buy the great art of their time before it became generally recognized would have to
immerse themselves in the art world to find the artists who were collaborating and competing to
develop their innovations, just as would the other artists who wanted to join these groups. Few
collectors purposely set out to do this, so the early collectors of the Impressionists were nearly
always friends of members of the group, and the same was later true of the early collectors of the
Abstract Expressionists. These informal groups were difficult for outsiders to find because they
were formed and maintained through word of mouth. Only a small group of advanced artists in
Paris in the late 1860s knew that Manet would be at Montmartre’s Café Guerbois each evening,
where he presided over a group of critics and aspiring artists that frequently included Zola,
Degas, Renoir, Monet, and Pissarro, just as few New Yorkers in the late 1940s and early ‘50s
knew that Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, Philip Guston, and many of their
fellow painters met most evenings at the Cedar Street Tavern on University Place.19
Today many artists continue to develop their art in these informal groups. Yet since the
1950s an important alternative has emerged. Until then, ever since the revolt of the
Impressionists against the French government’s Ecole des Beaux Arts, few important modern
artists had attended formal degree-granting art programs at universities or other formal
educational institutions. But since then the situation has changed. Thus during the 1960s the
leading English artists of their generation, including David Hockney, R. B. Kitaj, Allen Jones,
Peter Phillips, and Derek Boshier, attended the Royal College of Art.20 Similarly, in Germany
Gerhard Richter and Sigmar Polke met when they were students at the Kunstakedemie in

9
Dusseldorf in the early ‘60s. And the 1960s also saw an increase in the importance of formal art
21

programs in the United States, that has continued to the present.22
The importance of these academic programs in training advanced artists in the United
States is clear. So for example half of the 96 participants in the 2000 Whitney Biennial held
MFA degrees. No less than two-thirds of the younger artists in that exhibition - those born in
1960 or later - had done formal graduate studies in art.23
The importance of MFA programs in training advanced artists has not yet been the
subject of large scale quantitative investigation, but it is nonetheless apparent that a few schools
have played a leading role. So for example five of the Whitney Biennial participants in 2000 who
were born since 1960 had attended Yale, four had attended the School of the Art Institute of
Chicago, three each held degrees from the California Institute of the Arts and the University of
California at San Diego, and two had attended UCLA.
The rise of these art schools is not solely of academic interest. For the existence of a
school that consistently produces artists whose work eventually sells for high prices can
potentially help to solve the problem the collector faces in seeking to identify the groups of
young artists who will become the leading artists of their generations.
There appears to be just such a school.24 Table 1 lists 25 alumni of the Yale School of
Art, all of whom graduated between 1952 and 1989, and all of whom have produced at least one
work that has sold for $50,000 or more at auction. For these 25 artists, Table 2 shows the earliest
date at which each produced an individual work that subsequently sold at auction for at least each
price indicated in the table, from $50,000 to $1 million. Table 3 then shows the earliest date at
which an individual work by each of the same artists sold at auction for those same prices.

10
It should immediately be emphasized that these tables are not intended to serve as the
basis for calculations of rates of return, but are merely indicative of changes over time in the
value of these artists’ work. Rates of return for the works represented in the tables generally
cannot be calculated, because there are no reliable records of the initial purchase prices of the
works that were subsequently sold at auction, and thus generated the evidence recorded in Tables
2 and 3. Virtually all of these works were initially sold privately, principally by galleries. Yet
even though we cannot calculate rates of return for these artists’ early work, Tables 2 and 3 are of
considerable interest. No less than four Yale graduates from the late 1950s and the ‘60s - Chuck
Close, Eva Hesse, Brice Marden, and Richard Serra - have made works that have sold for more
than $1 million at auction. All four are among the most important American artists of their
generation. Two later graduates - Martin Puryear from the ‘70s and John Currin from the ‘80s have also already made works that have sold at auction for more than $500,000. Ten other
alumni - Bailey and Flack from the ‘50s, Bartlett, Fish, Graves and Mangold from the ‘60s,
Halley from the ‘70s, and Barney, Hamilton, and Phillips from the ‘80s - have all had their works
sell for at least $100,000 at auction. All of these artists are stars, whose work is shown in major
galleries, and displayed in many of the most important museums.
Yale’s consistent record of producing successful artists suggests how a collector can
identify important artists early in their careers, for there is a high probability that there will be
some among Yale’s students at any given time. Talking to members of the school should quickly
reveal which students are most respected. There is likely to be a consensus among the faculty and
graduate students as to which students - undergraduate as well as graduate - are most promising;
following Sir Alan Bowness’ scheme, if the faculty and students disagree, the opinions of the

25

students might be given a heavier weight.

11

Once the most promising students at Yale are identified, the simplest rule would be to
seek them out and buy some of their work. The evidence of Table 2, however, suggests that this
rule is too simple. The most valuable work of the artists considered here was invariably made
sometime after they left Yale. This lag can be long, as for example Richard Serra made his most
valuable sculpture to date 20 years after leaving Yale, and Chuck Close made his highest-priced
painting 18 years after graduating. Yet in other cases the lag was much shorter, as for example
seven years after leaving Yale Eva Hesse produced a sculpture that would later sell for more than
$2.2 million, and just two years after leaving Yale Brice Marden made a drawing that later
brought $1.3 million. More recently, Martin Puryear and John Currin made the works that are
their highest-priced to date nine and 13 years after their respective graduations.
These lags suggest that the collector should follow the careers of the most promising Yale
students, perhaps buying some work from their first gallery exhibitions, and continuing to buy
from their later solo shows until the price of their new work begins to rise.26 Tables 2 and 3
demonstrate clearly that the collector should not concentrate exclusively on painters. Some of the
most successful Yale graduates have worked in other media, as for example Hesse, Serra, and
Puryear are sculptors. More recently, other media have also become important; the video artist
Matthew Barney has already had no less than 20 of his works sell at auction for more than
$100,000 each.
The collector’s purchases do not have to be made blindly. The work that will eventually
become most valuable will embody conceptual innovations. Important conceptual innovations
are often simple, and they can usually be described clearly and succinctly. Understanding an

12
artist’s goals for his work, and how he is attempting to realize them, will help the collector to
judge whether the artist’s new work at each stage may make an important contribution. Keeping
in touch with a group of talented young artists from Yale will also allow the collector to draw on
the opinions of each of the group members as to the potential importance of the other young
artists’ work, and as Sir Alan Bowness recognized, these are the people most likely to understand
and appreciate the innovations of their colleagues.
The procedure described here is neither simple nor quick. Even after identifying an
important unknown artist, following his or her early career, and buying some of the artist’s work,
Table 3 shows that the collector may have to wait 10 years or more for the greatest payoffs. So
for example it was not until 31 years after its execution that Eva Hesse’s untitled sculpture of
1966 sold at auction for $2.2 million, and Richard Serra’s and Chuck Close’s highest auction
prices both came 17 years after they had executed the relevant works. More recently, however,
John Currin’s painting, Homemade pasta, sold at auction for $847,500 just five years after he
made it, and a work by Matthew Barney, from Cremaster 4, bought $387,500 at auction just four
years after its execution. These results reflect the strong art market of recent years, but they may
also point to collectors’ increasing awareness of the importance of conceptual innovators’ early
work.
Although Sir Alan Bowness didn’t mention scholars in his stage theory, it appears that
recognition by art historians generally arrives no earlier than the public acclaim that marks the
final confirmation of importance for modern artists. Because of this, some academic evidence
can be used to suggest that the success of the artists considered here is more than an artifact of
auction market fluctuations. Table 4 shows that no less than 18 of the 25 artists listed in Table 1

13
have their work illustrated in the latest editions of two leading textbooks of the subject. The
agreement of this scholarly judgment with that of the market is indicated by the fact that the
seven artists whose work is represented by three or more illustrations in the texts include the
four who have had individual works reach $1 million at auction.27 The textbooks also contain
additional evidence of Yale’s importance in contemporary art, for they include illustrations of the
work of six other alumni who are not included in this study because their work has not - or
perhaps, not yet - brought at least $50,000 at auction: Richard Anuskiewicz (MFA 1955), Bruce
Davidson (MFA 1957), Sylvia Plimack Mangold (BFA 1961), Haim Steinbach (MFA 1973),
Jessica Stockholder (MFA 1985), and the architect Maya Lin (BA 1981).28
The lag involved in the auction market’s recognition of important artists means that this
study includes no alumni of Yale’s art school more recent than Matthew Barney, who graduated
in 1989. Barney has had spectacular success both critically and commercially, but the question
might be raised of whether Yale has continued to produce successful artists.29 It appears that it
has. So for example in December, 2004, the New York Times devoted a full page, illustrated with
five color reproductions of individual paintings, to a story about Kehinde Wiley, a 27-year-old
painter, on the occasion of his first solo museum exhibition, at the Brooklyn Museum. The article
observed that “Mr. Wiley has achieved the kind of meteoric success that most young artists only
dream about. He is represented by major galleries in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. His
shows have been covered by the art press, as well as by mass-circulation magazines... If you want
to buy one of his newest paintings, which sell for up to $20,000, you’ll have to put your name on
a waiting list.”30 Wiley received an MFA from Yale in 2001.
This paper has suggested how a collector might proceed in the attempt to identify

14
currently unknown artists who are likely to become important in the future. Early buyers of the
work of a series of graduates of the Yale School of Art from the 1960s, ‘70s, and ‘80s have seen
their collections rise greatly in value over time, as Eva Hesse, Brice Marden, John Currin,
Matthew Barney, and a number of their fellow students grew from promising unknowns to
established masters of contemporary art. There is furthermore reason to believe that these
successful artists will be joined in future by other younger graduates of their alma mater, and that
the collectors who seek them out early in their careers will profit handsomely from their efforts.
There is of course considerable uncertainty in this scheme. And even if the collector is
successful, the financial returns from this procedure can be lowered by the long lag involved in
the market’s recognition of important artists, though these may be shorter now than in the past.
Even if this lag remains long, however, in the course of the process described here the collector
will have gained a deep understanding of advanced contemporary art. And this points up perhaps
the last relevant lesson from history, for throughout the modern era the collectors who have
realized the greatest success in the art market have been drawn from among those who had the
greatest appreciation of the art they bought.

The order of Bowness’ second and third stages might be questioned. In the past,
critical attention often preceded gallery exhibitions, but sometimes followed them. Today,
the large size of the art world appears to make gallery exhibitions necessary to attract
critical attention, thus reversing Bowness’ second and third stages. This is an interesting
consequence of the growth of art markets. For present purposes, however, the key point in
Bowness’ scheme is the priority of artists’ recognition of other talented artists.

The prices of paintings by unknown artists have risen over time, from about

$8,000- $12,000 today. For discussion see Krystyna Warchol, The Market System of the

The work chosen by the two textbooks to illustrate these artists’ contributions
underscores the predominantly conceptual basis of the art of this era, for the
reproductions overwhelmingly show works made by young artists. Thus 15 of the 18
artists are represented by works they made before the age of 40, and 11 are represented by
work made by the age of 35, while in contrast only three of the 40 total illustrations show
works made after the age of 50.

ed., The American Art Book (London: Phaidon, 2001), p. 477.

On Barney’s work, see for example Hopkins, After Modern Art, 1945-2000 pp.
244-45. Hopkins devotes a page to an analysis of Barney’s work - which serves as his
book’s conclusion - gives a full -page illustration of a still from Cremaster 4 (1955), and
uses the same illustration on the cover of his book.

Mia Fineman, “The History of Art, in Baggy Jeans and Bomber Jackets,” New
York Times (December 19, 2004), Arts Section, p. 39. It might also be noted that
admission to Yale’s art school continues to be highly valued by prospective artists. For

18
the fall term of 2003, the school admitted 58 of 1,100 applicants (5%); 55 of these 58
then accepted these offers of admission (95%). See School of Art, 2003-2004, Bulletin of
Yale University, Series 100, No. 1 (May 2004), p. 97.
