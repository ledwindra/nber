    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper studies how competition affects firms\u2019 expectations in a new dynamic general equilibrium model with rational inattention and oligopolistic competition where firms acquire information about their competitors\u2019 beliefs. In the model, firms with fewer competitors are less attentive to aggregate variables\u2014a novel prediction supported by survey evidence. A calibrated version of the model matches the relationship between firms\u2019 numbers of competitors and their uncertainty about aggregate inflation as a non-targeted moment. A quantitative exercise reveals that firms\u2019 strategic inattention to aggregates significantly amplifies monetary non-neutrality and shifts output response disproportionately towards less competitive oligopolies by distorting relative prices.\n\n",
