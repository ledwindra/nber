Energy Prices, Inflation, and Recession, 1974—75

ABSTRACT

The energy price shock depressed real output by two percent
in 1974 and by five percent in 1975, according to our results.

Prices rose by four percent in 1974 and by another two percent

in 1975. These conclusions are derived from an aggregate model
of the U.S. economy with an explicit role of energy in production.
The distinction between expected and unexpected shocks is an

important part of the model. We also examine monetary and fiscal
policies that might have offset the energy shock.

I. INTRODUCTION
The rapid escalation of energy prices in late 1973 and early 1974 has a

dominant role in most accounts of the deep recession and high inflation of

the mfd—1970s. This paper presents a quantitative appraisal of the response
of real output, prices, and employment to the energy price shock.

mcroeconomjc effects. Two of the most important mechanisms considered are

adverse impact of higher energy prices on the permanent incomes of

rates. The analysis of these and other channels of influence of energy

economy

by

within a compact macroeconomic model of the U.S.

with an explicit treatment of energy.

Our findings suggest that the energy price shock depressed real output
two percent in 1974 and by five percent in 1975, and so accounts for at

least

two—thirds of the total decline

in real output from trend that occurred

in those years. Consumption declined permanently by about three percent in
response to the decline in real incomes associated with the Increase in

price of a product which the nation imports, on net. Investment fell
temporarily but by a much larger percent. Prices rose by four percent in
1974 because of the energy shock, and inflation worsened by another two

percent in 1975. Together with the impact of the termination of price
controls, energy prices can account for all of the enormous acceleration of
inflation observed in 1974, but falls short of explaining the continued

inflation in 1975. The deep recession of 1974—75 could have been offset
or moderated by suitable policies.

In particular, the announcement in 1974

of a monetary expansion to take place in 1975 could have postponed the

—2-

inflation until 1975 and eliminated the recession. This conclusion
demonstrates our model's ability to handle the expectational issues that are
now recognized to be so important in studying the influence of aggregate
policy, but, of course, the conclusion rests on the stark assumption that
the public would believe an announcement of future policy.

Il fiscal

expansion could also havemoderated the recession, but at the cost of
inflation of almost 20 percent. in 1974. The bias in our model toward a
monetary rather than a fiscal offset comes from its incorporation of a full
treatment of the adverse effect of expansionary fiscal policy on aggregate

supply. We also look at the possible success of policies to counteract the
inflationary impetus from the energy shock. We conclude that contractionary
money policy would probably not have been capable of fully offsetting energy
inflation, and only an impracticably large fiscal contraction would have
done the job.

Our work follows in the footsteps of a number of innovative earlier

studies. One of the first to predict the recession as a result of the
energy shock seems to have been Robert Gordon (1974). A number of later
studies have followed. Some of these have made important theoretical
contributions, like Gordon (l975a), E. Phelps (1978), Solow (1978), and
Findlay

and Roderigues (1977). Others have

simulate

employed quantitative models to

the 1974—75 experience. These include Pierce and Enzler (1974),

Berner et al. (1975), Perry (1975a, b), Eckstein (1978), Fair (1978), Klein
(1978), and from a slightly different perspective Hudson and Jorgenson

(1978). Contributions of the more

informal type include Haberler (1976),

Serot (1978), and Okun (1975). The

present paper is, to our knowledge,

the

first attempt to give a unified treatment of the issues associated with
factor substitution on the one hand and monetary and general macroeconomic

— 3-.

aspects on the other. We have done this by constructing a medium-sized
macroeconomic model of the U.S. with an explicit treatment of energy. The
modeling of energy demand is similar to the various general equilibrium

energy-economy models (cf. e.g. Hudson and Jorgenson (1977) exce0t that our

model has a simpler, one—sector structure. The price of energy is taken as
exogenous, which is convenient for studying the macroeconomic effects.
The macroeconomic structure of our model includes a financial system,

which enables us to study various aspects of inflation and monetary policy.
The model incorporates the hypothesis of rational expectations, but it is

also somewhat Keynesian in treating money wages as predetermined in the short
run.. In a purely classical economy where wages clear the labor market
•

instantaneously, an unexpected energy price increase would reduc the level
of output as a way of substituting away from energy. Because of an accelerator
effect on investment, this impact would be larger in the short than in the

long run. However, there would be no effect on employment or prices. When
the price of one factor, energy, increases, the price of other factors,

especially the wage, would fall to offset it. Full employment should always
prevail, and the price level should be linked directly to the money stock.
In our model, on the contrary, wages respond slowly to unexpected changes

in energy prices (and to all other surprises in the economy). During the

period following an energy price increase but before the accommodating change
in the wage, labor is priced too high for full employment. Furthermore,

with wages sticky, an energy price increase increases the price level, so
that the real money supply is lowered, which has an additional contractionary

effect on the economy. Our model deals explicitly with these aspects of the
effect of an energy price shock; investment and interest rates play an
important role in the relation between the sticky wage rate and the

-4-

resulting levels of prices, output, ard employment.

When energy is partly imported, as in the U.S. of the 1970s, another
consideration links output and employment to an unexpected increase in energy
prices -—

higher

prices make the U.S. poorer and so reduce the level of

consumption in real terms.. Often this is compared to the imposition of a
tax on U.S. consumers. with the proceeds going to foreigners. As the U.S. is

made poorer, energy—supplying nations become richer. They acquire claims
upon the U.S. and face the choice of accumulating the claims (as government
or corporate bonds, stocks, direct investments and so on) or cashing them in
for goods produced in the, U.S. Our model does not attempt to explain the
choices' of oil producers in this regard, but uses a guess that oil producers

spend a relatively small fraction of their new income on U.S. goods. This
seems consistent. with observations on actual behavior in recent years.

II. The Model
The results of this paper are. obtained by simulation of a macro model of

the U.S. economy with explicit treatment of energy. The model was constructed on the basis of the one used by Hall (1978a), but contains some

important extensions and revisions. The present model treats the economy as
having two. sectors, goodsand energy. Only the goods sector is fully represented in the model. Energy is used as an input to the goods sector and is
thought of as primary energy, such as crude oil, natural gas at the welihead,

and coal at the minemouth. For simplicity, there is a single price of energy,
though it should be recognized that this is only a rough approximation. The
price of energy is viewed as exogenous, and what cannot be supplied by the

domestic energy sector is imported. The price elasticity of domestic energy
supply is not considered here.
The goods sector combines labor, capital, and energy to produce goods.
The, term "goods" covers all sorts of goods and services and includes finished

energy products such as gasoline and electricity. Total goods production is
allocated among consumption, investment in the goods sector, government

expenditures, net export of goods, and deliveries to the energy sector. It
differs from real GNP by the amount of the last item, which is small, and

net eergy imports.
Within this sector, the critical elements of the model are the technology constraint, the price equation, the specifications of the investment.

process and wage determination, including lags; the consumption function;
and the demand function for money.
The technology constraint is represented in the form of a unit cost

following properties. The own price elasticity of energy demand is about

labor. These are long—run elasticities; short-run behavior

is

modeled by

The low value for the own

elasticity of energy in the aggregate is supported by evidence by Mork (l973a)

and by casual reading of post—1973 data. The unitary elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is strongly supported by the evidence of

Berndt (1976) and many other authors. For the corresponding elasticity
between capital and energy, strikingly different estimates can be found in

various parts of the literature.' Despite new insights and attempted recon—
ciliations,2 the issue seems to remain a subject of controversy. Our choice
of a zero elasticity is partly based on the evidence of Hudson and Jorgenson

(1978). Although their model has capital-energy complementarity for the
manufacturing sector, substitutability in service industries and interindustry
shifts in final demand gives a net effect on capital intensity of the

1973-74 energy price increase that is very close to zero. We hope to pursue
this issue at a later stage.

The overall price leve, defined as the money price of goods., is
determined as standard unit cost, described by the price equation

taxes. The function 4 is the same as

in (1), but the arguments are slightly different. First, fluctuations in the
efficiency wage due to cyclical variations in productivity, are excluded from
the price equation (2) where as the technology constraint (1) includes them.

Secondly, the capital price used in the price equation is a long-run average
of the real rental price times the price level rather than the actual nominal

price as in (1). This formulation corresponds with the following important
findings of the price equation literature: (1) Apart from the effect via
wages, fluctuations in demand have little or no effect on the price level;1

(2) prices show no sensitivity to cyclical fluctuations in productivity;2
and (3) transitory fluctuations in interest rates do not affect prices.3 In
addition, this specification seems to give a sensible estimate of the partial
impact on the price level of an energy price increase, namely the share of
energy in variable cost.

Investment demand is derived from the demand for capital. However, in
the short run, the model assumes that the economy's ability to adjust the

capital stock is limited. Part of the investment in the next few years is
already committed today and cannot be adjusted in response to new informa-

tion. Specifically, this is modeled by treating capital as an aggregate of
m categories, such that the quantity of category j needs to be determined
j

-1

years in advance. Each category enters symmetrically in the technology

model; but the categories are imperfect substitutes in production, since
otherwise all investment would be concentrated in the category with the
shortest lead time.

In the year of the energy shock, investment in m -

1

categories is committed already, whereas investment in the last category is
'Cf. Gordon (1970, 1971, 1977), Nordhaus (1972), Hall (1979).

-8-

determined by the demand for capital of that category as determined by present

and expected future prices and demand. The next year, another category
becomes "flexible" until all capital and investment is determined by post-

energy shock forces after four years. This formulation, which is adapted
from Hall (l978a), does justice to the physical lags in the investment

process without introducing arbitrary lags for expectation formulation)
The lag in wage determination is incorporated in a similar way, except
that it is the nominal wage, not the quantity of labor services, that is com-

mitted in advance. When wages are set, they clear the labor market., or come
as close as they can given current information about future demand for labor.
When unexpected events occur, such as the doubling of the price of energy
considered here, the demand function for labor determines the level of em—

ployment, which may then be well below the supply of labor. This can be
interpreted as a characterization of the Keynesian hypothesis of wage
rigidity and is an attempt to embody the view that the labor market achieves
equality of supply and demand in the long run but that the process takes

time. It implies a kind of Phillips curve for the economy. However, in
place of the expected inflation term that has been the source of so much
instability and conceptual ambiguity in the literature on the Phillips curve,

expectations of future labor demand are formed using the model itself. In
particular, feedback from prices to wages occurs in the model to the extent
that price increases signal current or future increases in the demand for
labor (as they typically do).

This formulation, set forth by Hall (l978a), has been extended in two

appropriate.

directions. First, a cost of living increase has been added to the pre—
connitted wage rate. Specifically, for each percentage point of unexpected
price inflation, the Coniiitted wage rate is raised by 0.25 percent in the

same year and another 0.25 percent in the

year after. Roughly, this corres-

ponds to a 50 percent escalation clause with a six month lag, assumed to
reflect the time needed for data collection.

The inclusion of this feature

is justified by the widespread occurrence of such clauses in the U.S. labor
contracts (cf. Mitchell (1978)) as well as the theoretical argument
by Hall
and Lilien (1979) that efficient labor contracts will have this feature.
Furthermore, it allows for a positive feedback from

in the short run. Since it turns out
the demand for labor permanently,

energy prices to wages

that an energy price increase lowers

however, this positive feedback is counter-

acted by a tendency towards lower wages in the longer run.
The other extension is an adjustment fn the comitted wage rate to in-

corporate cyclical movements in labor productivity. This feature makes the
model obey Okun's law but has few other implications and thus will not be
discussed in detail here.

Consumption in the model is determined by permanent income. Consumers
are viewed as looking into the future to evaluate their future incomes, and
then choosing a growth path of consumption that is the highest feasible given

expected future income. The behavior of consumption has the character described by Hall (1978b) —— consumers
always plan a constant growth rate for

consumption. When new information arrives, they make an immediate once—and—
for-all adjustment to the level of consumption. We assume that consumption
is unaffected by real interest rates, in the sense that the rate of growth

of planned consumption does not depend on the interest rate. Note that the
assumption in Hall (1978a) that consumption is unresponsive to all economic

-1 0—

events is replaced by an explicit dependence on permanent income.
Government expenditure and net export of goods are taken to be

exogenous. Among other things this means that, rather than modeling the
behavior of petroleum exporting countries, we use an outside estimate of
their demand for U.S. goods.
In the money demand function, the major issue is the specification of
the variable that measures the dollar volume of transactions.

The use of

nominal gross national product for this purpose is one of the many reasons

that macroeconomic models in existence in 1973 were unable to deal effectively
with the energy price shock (cf. the remarks by Pierce and Enzler, op. cit.,
p. 16) -— nominal GNP subtracts imports and so cancels out much of the effect

of higher energy prices. We use the dollar volume of output from the goods
sector as a proxy for transactions. This variable makes sense in view of the
fact that much of the money stock is in the hands of consumers, not businesses.
We neglect the small contribution to the demand for money that might come
from the energy sector (recall that all energy passes through the goods
sector on its way to final demand).
A technical presentation of the model is given in the Appendix.

HI. Actual Performance of the U.S. Economy, 1973—77
The upper panel of Table 1 summarizes the

actual performance of the U.S.

economy over the last five years. The data have been recast so as to fit
into the sectoral and conceptual framework

defined as total GNP minus GNP

of our model. Gross output is

originated in the energy sector (defined as

co&1 mining and oil and gas extraction), plus the value of primary energy

input to the goods sector.1 Investment is defined

as gross private domestic

investment except structures for mining exploration, shafts, and wells, and

mining and oilfield machinery. Rather than following the practice of double
deflation, which can be misleading over a period with changing relative
prices, all nominal figures were deflated by a coninon price index. We used
the

Consumer Price Index for this purpose and for general description of the

price level over the period. We preferred the CPI to the GNP deflator
because it corresponds better to our definition of gross output.2'3
rn spite of the differences in definition, the numbers of Table 1 are

very close to the standard macroeconomic variables. This
however, the result of several factors

similarity is,

working in different directions. Thus,

the decline in gross output is made larger than the fall in GNP by the
exclusion of the domestic energy sector, whereas the increased value of

energy imports worked in the opposite direction. Furthermore,

likely to have been important.
noted by Pierce and Enzler (op. cit.), import price increases affect the
GNP deflator only through the increases in the prices of domestically
produced substitutes. There is no direct effect because imports are
substracted off in the computation of GNP from gross output data.

covers consumer goods only.

the CPI made for a somewhat larger decline in real output in 1974.
The

growth

largest decline in real output took place from 1973

rate

to

1974 with a

of -1.5 percent. The depth of the recession was, however,

reached in 1975 with real production 2.3 percent below its 1973 level. This
was also the year of record high unemployment rates. As for the components
of output, the decline in investment in 1974—75 was most spectacular, as was

its rapid rebound during the recovery. However, the stagnation of consumption was equally significant. Net exports of goods increased substantially
in 1974 and 1975 but declined in 1976 and 1977, apparently as a result of
the worldwide recession.

The price level movements over this period are well known. The first
jump came with higher food prices in 1973 with another jump, twice as large,

partly caused by higher energy prices, following in 1974. Although inflation
slowed down somewhat after these jumps, prices continued to rise at high rates

in 1975 and the following years. The development of the value of energy
imports from 1972 to 1974 illustrates the transfer of wealth from the U.S. to

oil-exporting countries. Part of the increase is due to an increase in
quantity. This accounts for about half of the increase from 1972 to 1973.
For the following year, however, the quantity increase was minimal. Thus,
the wealth transfer may be roughly approximated as a $19 billion annual
transfer of income.

IV. Estimates of the Energy Price Shock
Our first step was to prepare a base case describing the possible evolution of the economy from 1973 in the absence of the abrupt increase in the

price, of energy. Table 2 shows the assumptions in the base case and the

model's corresponding projections. The nominal price of energy was assumed
to increase at the same rate as the general price level. For all years except
1974 this was assumed to be 5 percent, which is the natural rate of Inflation

of the model. For 1974 an additional 2 percent inflation was projected as a
result

of the removal of general wage and price controls. The committed

wage rate and the money stock were assumed to grow at 6.3 percent and 6 per-

cent per

year respectively. Investment commitments for 1974 were assumed to

somewhat lower than investment In the mini-boom of 1973 and

be

smoothly

to grow

from then on. The labor force, expressed as the natural rate of

employment, was assumed to grow at about 1 .7 percent per year, which is

about the same as population growth in recent years.1

When combined with

a labor productivity growth rate of 1 .2 percent, this gives a total natural
growth rate of slightly below 3 percent. This is lower than the postwar
average but seems well in accordance with recent experience.

The

model's projections are

based on the absence of any surprises or

shocks. The employment rate is the natural or equilibrium rate, which is
6

percent in our model. The wages actually set (the "flexible wage rate")

equal the committed levels; roughly the same is true for investment. Real
output grows smoothly and inflation proceeds at 5 percent.

takes an unexpected jump of 68 percent in 1974 relative to its value in the

base case. There is an additional but smaller surprise in 1975, so in that
year the price of energy is 105 percent higher than in the base case. In all

subsequent years the real price of energy is the same as in 1975. These
figures were chosen to approximate the actual events of 1973-75 and are dis-

cussed in more detail below. Note that the increases are in addition to the
projected increases of 7 and 5 percent respectively in each of the two years.

in accordance with recent observations) Net

goods are assumed to increase but only by a fraction of the

transfer of income from the U.S. to foreigners following the oil price

increase (Cf. Table 1). Specifically, the sum of net exports of goods and
government expenditures is assumed to follow its actual path for 1974—76 and
to grow at a constant rate after that.

Overall Impact

The energy price shock generates a sizeable recession in the model. The

energy price increase affects the economy via two principal channels. The
first is a permanent lowering of the growth path of the economy as a result

of labor-energy substitution. The higher energy prices induce more laborintensive methods of production, but since the supply of labor is fixed in

the long run, this can be done only by lowering output. The reduction in
output carries with it an accelerator-effect on investment.

Consumption is

also affected since real income to domestic consumers is reduced by the
amount of increase of the real value of energy imports. This effect is,
1Cf. Goldfeld (1976).

-l 8-.

however, mitigated, first by the substitution away from energy, and secondly
by the fact that some of the energy imports are financed by accumulating

claims rather than export of goods. For the same reason, exports of goods
is increased, but by less than the increase in energy imports. All these

effects concern only the real part of the economy; the story told above is
essentially a one—sector version of Hudson and Jorgenson's multisectoral
studies,1 except that our model does not assume that the labor market clears.
More than half of the recession in the model seems explainable this way.

The other channel is related specifically to the financial sector of the

economy. As wages are largely predetermined when the shock occurs, the
sharp energy price increase causes a jump in the. price level. Consequently,
the transactions demand for money increases; stated equivalently, the real

money supply declines, so that, in Keynesian terms, the LH-curve shifts to

the left. The financial tightening drives up interest rates, thus discouraging investment. The resulting loss in real wealth depresses consumption as well. The fall in real money supply-is furthermore increased by
additional increases in the price level triggered by cost of living
escalators in wage contracts, and by a permanent increase in the real
interest rate of 0.35 percentage points.
The net result of all these forces and their interactions is an extra-

ordinarily high inflation rate combined with a severe recession. For 1974,
the model estimates that the total impact on real output was a reduction of

26 billion dollars, or about 2 percent. This is almost exactly the same
amount as the reduction in consumption, whereas investment decreased by
7 billion and net exports of goods and government expenditure increased by

the same amount. The effect on output is largest in the second and third
-

—19-

years after the shock, in 1975-76, when real output is down by 63 and

54 billion 1972 dollars, respectively. The bulk of this is decreased invest-

ment,

especially in 1975; but the 3.3 percent permanent drop in consumption

is sizeable enough.

The fall in real output Is acconipanied by a decline in

employment of 2 million workers in 1975 and a corresponding increase in the
unemployment

rate of 1.7 percentage points.

The predicted effect on the price level is substantial in the first two
years.

The monetary expansion implicit in the shift in money demand from

maintains the effect and Increases it slightly. In terms of rates of
inflation, the effect is by far largest in 1974 with 4 percentage points

added to the inflation rate. It tapers off thereafter and becomes slightly
negative in 1977. The model offers a complete explanation of inflation in
1974, but cannot explain completely the cOntinued high inflation in 1975 and
the following years.

Comparing Table 3 with the lower panel of Table 1, the energy price
shock appears to explain about two thirds of the recession in terms of

decline in real output in 1974 and 1975, and practically all its shortfall

thereafter

As will be shown below, however, a part of the remaining one

third for the first two years can be explained as a decline in the demand for
consumer durables, which is not treated explicitly by our model. This may
increase the 1974—75 figures from two thirds to about four fifths. The magnitude of these ratios depend, however, crucial.ly on how large the total

conclusions about the total magnitude of the

It seems clear, however, that the energy price shock was its

largest single cause; and that, given the assumptions used here, very little
of the behavior of real output is left unexplained.

Consumption

Consumption is determined by permanent income in our model. This, in turn,
is affected mainly by three factors associated with the energy price increase.
The largest, and perhaps most obvious effect comes from the transfer of income

resulting from the increased value of energy imports. The magnitude of the
transfer is reduced somewhat by substitution away from energy; but the
19 billion figure derived in section III may serve as a good approximation.
The second factor affecting permanent income is the recession itself.
The decline in investment induced by the financial tightening represented a

permanent loss of productive capacity and hence income. The third factor
goes the other way and follows from the fact that oil-exporting countries
accumulate part of their new wealth as claims on the U.S. economy rather than

spending it. Since this accumulation is in fact saving, the productive
capacity of the U.S. economy is increased, and hence permanent income)
The simulated consumption path tracks actual consumption quite well .

The

exception occurs mainly in 1975, when actual decline was much larger; and a

similar, but much smaller discrepancy is found for 1974. The main reason
for this discrepancy is probably the failure of our model to account

1This result depends crucially on the assumption that oil exporters will not
attempt to exchange their claims for U.S. goods in the foreseeable future.
If this were expected, the model should have assumed a future increase in
the net export of goods. This wouH have reduced Dermanent income for
domestic consumers.

—21—

explicitly for the special behavior of expenditures for consumer durables.1
As is well known, a decline in permanent income has an accelerator-like effect

on the spending on durables. For the present drop in permanent income, the
resulting one—time drop in spending can be estimated roughly as 15 billions.

f it is assumed that one third of this took place in 1974 and the rest in
1975, the consumption level of 1974 is explained fully, and half of the gap is

closed for 1975.2 The authors hope to return to this issue in future work
with the model.

Itment
Since investment demand is derived from the demand for capital as an input
to production, the magnitude of the decline in investment in the model depends
on the elasticity of substitution between capital and energy, which we have

assumed to be practically zero. The drop in investment would have been larger
with capital-energy complementarity and lower if the two inputs are substi-

tutes in production. Although our choice of a zero elasticity is open for
attack from both sides, it does give a good tracking of the actual investment

data. We hope to investigate this aspect more carefully at a later stage.

Price Level

Our model indicates that the effect of the energy price shock on the

1The main reason why we did not include this in the model is technical .
Adding
consumer durables as a third asset in addition to money and capital would
have added considerably to the complexity of the model because of its
rational expectations property, so that the solution method presently used

would have been highly inadequate.

2The discussion of this aspect in the literature (cf. Eckstein (1978),
Perry
(1975a), Okun (1975)) has concentrated on automobile sales, which dropped
substantially in 1974. One has to be cautious, however, so as not to
confuse income and substitution effects in automobile demand, since a good
deal of the change that took place was from larger to smaller cars, and
possibly from automobiles to other, less energy—intensive consumer goods.

—22-

general price level was quite substantial.

In fact, it can be claimed that the

extraordinary inflation in 1974 can be explained completely by this event and

the removal of general price controls. Table 4 shows a decomposition of inflation in 1974 and 75. Out of the 11 percent inflation in 1974, the model
attributes 2.8 percentage points, or about one fourth of the total, to the

direct impact of higher energy prices. Another 0.7 percentage points are attributed to the permanent increase in the real cost of capital,1 and a similar

contribution comes from wage increases. The wage increase itself is a weighted
average of the increase due to cost of living clauses and the decrease in the

market-clearing wage. This decrease is somewhat lower than it would have been
if the monetary expansion implicit in the shift in money demand had not been
assumed.2 Adding all these effects. gives a total contribution to inflation

of about 4 percentage points. Together with the effect of price decontrol
and natural inflation in the model, this gives an inflation rate in 1974 that
is very close to the observed increase in the consumer price index.

The 1975 inflationary experience is not so easily explained by our model.
There was another direct impact of energy price increase about half as much as

in 1974, and wages continued to increase somewhat in the model. There is,
however, a gap of 2percentage points of inflation for 1975 that we are unable
to explain as a result of the energy price shock.
The impact on the price' level depends of course crucially on the measure-

ment of the energy price increase itself. It is worthwhile to consider this
problem in a little more detail. The price of energy covers all forms of
'We are aware that previous attempts to find an interest rate effect in the
price equation have not been very successful (cf. section II above). Our
price equation reflects this finding by excluding the current real interest

rate and using a long—run average instead. Failure to include this long—run
average would have produced a serious logical inconsistency in our model by

forcing firms to run permanent deficits.
the other hand, this shift also gives a slight permanent reduction in
the real interest rate, which tends to reduce the price level.

primary energy: crude oil (and imported petroleum products), natural gas,
coal, and hydroelectric and nuclear power. The observed crude oil prices for
this period were affected by the price equalization program. It has been
argued, however, that this program was hot fully effective in regulating the
price of oil to final users because the prices of petroleum products are largely

determined by the world market.1 Rather than taking sides in this discussion,
we looked at the published prices of petroleum products, calculated backwards
what the increase in crude prices would have been to give the observed product
price increase, and termed this the effective increase in crude oil prices.

This was 110 percent from 1973 to 1974 and 16 percent the following year. For
coal, the wholesale price index was assumed satisfactory, which gave 52 and

16 percent increases for the two years, respectively. Hydra and nuclear electricity were evaluated as the fossil fUel cost it replaces, and their prices

were assumed to follow that of coal. The most serious problem existed for
natural gas because the observed prices obviously did not clear the market in

the relevant period. At this point we made the assumption that the effective
price of gas followed that of crude oil. We then computed a preliminary energy
price index as a Divisia index of the coal and oil prices. This gave an increase
in the price of primary energy of 99 percent in 1974 and 16 percent in 1975.

We recognize, however, that, because of regulations and controls, only a part

of the 1974 increase reached the final users in that year. This is particularly
true for fuel used for electricity and utility gas, because energy deliveries

from utilities typically cannot be resold in the open market. Consequently, we
assumed that the effective real increase in the price of energy in 1974 was only
80 percent of what our preliminary index indicated, but that our energy price

level for 1975 was fully effective. This gave the energy price numbers in
Table 3.

V. Comparison of Models
Table 5 presents the estimates of six different models of the impact of
the energy price shock on inflation, aggregate output, investment, and con-

sumption. For results other than our own in Table 3, the sources are
Eckstein (1978) for the DRI model, Perry (1975b) for the FRB and University

of Michigan models, Pierce and Enzler (1974) for the FIPS model, and Fair

(1978) for Fair's model. Making the estimates comparable offered some
problems. First, inflation is measured by different indices in the various

models. This is discussed further below.

Secondly, the sector division of

our model is somewhat different from the rest. We assume, though, that
relative changes in GNP and gross output of our model are roughly comparable,
and that the same is true for investment in the goods sector as against

overall investment. Thirdly, since the models have different baseline

deflators had been used, resulting in real figures in 1958 and

1972 as well as 1973 dollars. Using the 1972 deflators of the three years,
these were all converted to 1972 dollars.
Because of the different measures used, it is difficult to compare the
estimates of the inflationary impact of the energy price increase. As
discussed above in section II, the GNP deflator tends to give a lower esti-

mate than measures of consumer prices, because imports are subtracted off in

the construction of the GNP deflator. This difference becomes apparent in
Eckstein's figures, who presents estimates for both the GNP deflator and the

Consumer Price Index as well. Furthermore, Fair's estimate is based on a
slightly different definition of the shock in that he compares actual inflation
to predicted inflation with all import prices growing at 6 percent per year.
However, even accounting for this difference, Fair's estimates seem unreasonably
high, implying that import prices were responsible for three quarters of all

inflation in 1974. Comparing our model to the remaining ones we find that,
even after accounting for the conceptual differences, our estimate of the
inflationary impact is substantially higher, whereas the other models agree
fairly well among themselves.

Given the disagreement about the effect on inflation, the estimates of the

real effects are remarkably close. All models predict a significant recession
as a result of the energy price shock, but no model depicts this shock as its

single cause. It may also be noted that the more recently published results,
whose authors benefited from hindsight, indicate a deeper recession. Ibpefully,
this means that economists have learned some lessons over the past few years.
The real effect of the energy price shock is different in our model not

so much in magnitude as in structure. With a slightly unconventional formulation of money demand1 and a relatively high interest elasticity of investment
demand, the drop in investment becomes the most significant feature of the

recession in our model. Indeed, our model predicts a drop in investment for
1975 tnat is three times as large as in the DRI model and very close to what

actually happened. The Michigan model has figures similar to the DRI model
for investment, and the FRB model somewhat less.

All models predict significant effects on consumption)

it is

interesting to note that models with more or less Keynesian consumption
functions give results that are very similar to our permanent income formula-

tion with rational expectations. It is clearly suggested by the numbers of
Table 5 that the assessment of the real effects of energy price changes is
quite robust with respect to many basic model assumptions.

Eckstein's effect on consumption is based on comparison with unrevised actual
figures published at an early date.
If we compare with the revised figures,
his

numbers for consumption would decrease to -.1.4 percent in both 1974 and

1975. This is the result of the fact that, from March to July 1976, actual
growth in consumption for 1975 was revised upwards from 0.9 to 1.9 percent.

As Eckstein pointed out to us in private conversation, this means that data
revisions were almost as large as the effect of the energy price shock.

-29—

VI. Policies to Offset the Macroeconomic Impacts of the Energy Shock
The effects of the energy price shock on output, employment, and prices
could have been altered by manipulation of macroeconomic policy instruments.
For example, with monetary or fiscal expansion, the effects on output and
employment

could have been attenuated or even eliminated. Table 6 shows the

results of two such policies, both aimed at stabilizing

employment at around

6 percent in all years.

The two policies are expansion of the money supply and a government

spending program. The monetary expansion alternative seems by far the most
attractive of the two. It gives higher real growth and much lower inflationary response than the fiscal expansion. The necessary monetary expansion
has a somewhat curious form: no extraordinary money growth is needed in the
year of the shock, if an announcement is made that money supply will grow by
an extra 2.4 percentage points the year after, 1.2 percentage points in the

third year, and then return to its normal growth rate. The inflationary
response of this policy is also somewhat surprising, in that inflation is

predicted to go down rather than up in the year of the shock. The explanation for this is that monetary expansion lowers the real interest rate permanently and that this effect dominates the Phillips curve effect for this

year. Obviously, this response is a conjecture and has not been inferred
directly

from the data.

Fiscal

expansion can also stabilize the unemployment rate. However, a

significant part of the employment effect in this case is a substitution
effect as fiscal expansion increases the real interest rate substantially.

Real growth suffers. Furthermore, the resulting inflation rates are
forbidding. The same timing problem as above between the first and the

second year occurs with the opposite sign, but this does not change the over-

all picture very much. Finally, there is a problem of how to carry out this
policy. As a pure spending program it could be done as shown in Table 6,
but it is clear that the amounts of extra spending needed are extremely

large. In practice, tax cuts have been more popular among political decision
makers; but there seems no simple answer to how an increase in spending
equivalent to the one in Table 6 could have been obtained within a framework
of permanent income consumption.

The other possible policy goal is of course to stabilize inflation. On
the surface, monetary restraint seems the most obvious candidate for this
purpose. However, although monetary policy is the perfect i.nstrurnent for

affecting the price level in the long run In our model, the short run is not

so simple. It turns out that the monetary contraction needed to depress wages
sufficiently in our model also pressures the real interest rate upward perma-

nently, so that the negative effect on prices is offset. We wereable to
simulate a monetary response that brought inflation rates for the first two

years back to their base case levels only by introducing a monetary expansion
in the third year that would be even more extreme than the contraction needed

in the first two. Although this did the trick of keeping down the real
interest rate, we do not find this alternative credible for actual policy-

making. Hence, we conclude that eliminating the energy—induced inflation in
1974—75 by monetary policy would not have been practically feasible.
Since fiscal policy has the opposite effect on interest rates, it seems

more attractive for this purpose. Table 7 shows the results of such a simulation. However, the necessary policy response is

unrealistically

large; indeed,

a near 35 percent surplus in the federal budget would have been needed in
1975.

VII. Summary and Conclusions
We have constructed and simulated a relatively small macroeconomic model

of the United States with energy. The important features of the model are a
technology constraint with the three inputs capital, labor, and energy and
with a flexible functional form; a money demand function with gross output
as the transaction variable; a permanent income consumption function;

rational expectations; and some important short run rigidities, notably in
wage and price determination and in the investment process.

Large and unanticipated changes in the price of energy are found to have

substantial disruptive effects on the economy. We have simulated the 1973—74
energy price increase and found the following effects: the rate of inflation
was increased by four percentage points in 1974 and near two percentage

points in 1975. Real output was decreased by 26 billion dollars (1972) in
1974, 63 billion in 1975, and around 50 billion in each of the following

three years. For 1975, the relative decline was near 5 percent. The effect
was found to have been largest for investment, but consumption decreased by

a significant 3.3 percent in each year. The effects on employment can be
expressed as an increase in the unemployment rate of near one percentage

point in 1974, rising to 1.7 percentage points in 1974, and tapering off

thereafter. The energy price shock was clearly a major cause of the 1974-75
recession and inflation. Other forces were present, however, such as the
removal of the last price controls of the Economic Stabilization Program,

and the slowdown of investment activity after the preceding miniboom. The
collective effect of these and other possible factors seem, though, to have
been substantially less than that of the energy price shock.

Our findings carry obvious implications for the expected effects of

-34-.

current events in the world market for oil. At the time of this writing it
is not entirely clear how large the price increase is going to be and how

much of it will be unanticipated. It seems likely that the oil price increase
will be substantially smaller than in 1974; however, the aggregate cost share
of energy is larger in the U.S. today than it was. five years ago, which

suggests a larger effect per percentage point of energy price increase. The
authors plan to follow up the present paper with a study of these events.

Appendix:

Technical Presentation of the Model

The model is a monetary growth model of a type similar to that of
Sidrauski

(1967), but with energy as a third factor, rigidities In the

short

run, and rational expectations. The static part of the model is made up of

five

markets:
—

Input

markets:

- Labor
—

Capital

— Energy
- The market for goods
-

Money market

The money market and themarket for energy clear in each period; the three
other markets may or may not clear, depending on rigidities.

The rigidities are of three kinds. First, for the goods market, a
standard unit cost pricing rule is assumed rather than marginal cost pricing

in the short run. Secondly, only a fraction of the capital stock can be
adjusted in the short run; and the adjustable part is assumed an imperfect

substitute to the unadjustable part. Thirdly, wages are downward rigid.
The dynamic part of the model is made up by capital accumulation and
permanent—income consumption on the one hand and by rational expectations

price dynamics on the other. The latter is derived from the assumed

equality

of the real return to capital and the real interest rate.
Technology Model and Factor Markets

Factor demand under cost minimization is determined by Shephard's lemma:

i=L,K,E
The supply of energy is assumed to be infinitely elastic at the exogenously
given

price. Rigidities in the investment process are modeled in the

following way. There are m categories of capital; the quantity of category i

is determined j — 1 years in advance. The various categories

enter

symmetrically in the technology model but are imperfect substitutes, or else
all investment would be concentrated in the category with the shortest lead

time. A simple Cobb—Douglas form is chosen for the capital submodel

category has the level R1. The year after, m — 2 categories have the level

their level determined by post-shock conditions ("f1exible capital), (A.3)

Wages are thought of as determined by contracts. All contracts last n years,
and contracts are renegotiated by one category each year. Wages are
negotiated so as to clear the market in expectation. The market-clearing

wage renegotiated after the shock is denoted , and full employment is

Contracts negotiated before the shock set a starting wage level of

is the expected price level, specified as the base case forecast. Thus,
defining

as the fraction of categories with wages renegotiated after the

shock, the average wage per worker is

*1-ft1

The efficiency wage over the cycle differs from w because of cyclical
fluctuations in labor productivity. This component of productivity is
approximated by the following formulation. Consider the market for a
category of labor whose contract has not been renegotiated. Disequilibrium
in this market can be measured by the relative difference between the

actual nd the market-clearing wage, i.e., by the ratio

w/w
The tightness in the labor market as a whole depends also on how many

categories have had their wages renegotiated. The following measure is
proposed:

1This formula and (A.ll) should riot be thought of as strictly technological
relationships, but rather as a convenient way of modeling wage rigidity.

Thus, the average wage rate per efficiency unit is defined as

w =

h =

This is the wage rate that enters in the factor demand equations, whereas

w is used in the price equation (cf. below).

The Goods Market
The demand for goods consists of consumption, investment, net exports

of goods, and government expenditures. The latter two are considered
exogenous, and investment demand is discussed above. Consumption follows
the permanent income hypothesis. This is modeled as

=

gt

where g = 0.029 is the sum of the rate of growth of the labor force and the
rate of labor productivity growth.

C0 is determined endogenously as

described below.
Goods are produced by capital ,

labor,

and energy subject to the produc-

tion possibility constraint (A.l). After a shock occurs, some categories
of capital have predetermined levels so that the firms' marginal cost

-41 -

schedule is upward sloping in the short run. Rather than treating this as
the supply schedule for goods, however, the model specifies a standard unit
cost pricing rule and assumes that firms passively supply any amount of
goods demanded at that. price. The pricing rule takes the form of the price
equation

P rather than w and

Since

(partially) fixed factor, It fluctuates procyclically whereas PV does not.
Thus, there is no demand effect in the price equation.

The Market for Money

The financial sector of the economy is compressed into one equation of

our model, namely the money demand equation. Its form is
tn(PY/M) =

(A.19)

Money supply, M, is thought of as supplied exogenously by the monetary
authority and, in the absence of specific policy actions, to grow at a

constant exponential rate. Money and capital are considered perfect
substitutes so that arbitrage gives

Dynamic Solution of the Model

The solution algorithm assumes initial guesses for the initial levels of
consumption and price level and for the long run average of the real cost of

capital V. The initial level of V is given historically. The model can then
be solved period by period, and (M.l), (M.2), (M.l4) and (NL18) give the
dynamic links between periods.
Since it turns out that the roots of this system are unstable, the
solution based on initial guesses will give a finite path of price level and

capital stock only by chance. The model therefore searches over several
values of initial price and consumption levels until it finds a pair that

gives a finite solution. This process limits the initial price level to a
very tight interval and determines the permanent income level of consumption.
A final set of iterations makes the value of V consistent with the steady—
state value of v.
