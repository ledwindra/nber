Entrepreneurial Finance and Non-diversifiable Risk

ABSTRACT
Entrepreneurs face significant non-diversifiable business risks. We build a dynamic incomplete markets
model of entrepreneurial finance to demonstrate the important implications of nondiversifiable risks
for entrepreneurs' interdependent consumption, portfolio allocation, financing, investment, and business
exit decisions. The optimal capital structure is determined by a generalized tradeoff model where leverage
via risky non-recourse debt provides significant diversification benefits. More risk-averse entrepreneurs
default earlier, but also choose higher leverage, even though leverage makes his equity more risky.
Non-diversified entrepreneurs demand both systematic and idiosyncratic risk premium. Cash-out option
and external equity further improve diversification and raise the entrepreneur’s valuation of the firm.
Finally, entrepreneurial risk aversion can overturn the risk-shifting incentives induced by risky debt.

Introduction

Entrepreneurship plays an important role in fostering innovation and economic growth (Schumpeter (1934)). For reasons such as incentive alignment and informational asymmetry between
the entrepreneur and financiers, entrepreneurs typically hold a significant non-diversified equity
position in their businesses, and thus bear non-diversifiable entrepreneurial business risk.1 For
example, using data from the survey of consumer finance, Gentry and Hubbard (2004) report that
active businesses on average account for 41.5 percent of entrepreneurs’ total assets. Moskowitz
and Vissing-Jorgensen (2002) document that about 75 percent of all private equity is owned by
households for whom it constitutes at least half of their total net worth.
Entrepreneurs are both producers and consumers.

Like firms, they need to make invest-

ment/capital budgeting, financing, and business exit decisions. Like consumers, they also manage household finance and have preferences for intertemporal consumption smoothing. The nondiversifiable idiosyncratic risk that the entrepreneurs bear from their businesses makes the business
decisions and household decisions interdependent. We integrate intertemporal household finance
(consumption-smoothing, portfolio choice) with corporate finance, and provide a utility-maximizing
framework to analyze the entrepreneurial firm’s capital budgeting/investment, capital structure,
and business exit decisions.
We model an infinitely-lived risk-averse entrepreneur who has access to an illiquid non-tradable
investment project. The project requires a lump-sum investment to start up, and generates stochastic cash flows that bear both systematic and idiosyncratic risks. If he chooses to take on the project,
the entrepreneur sets up a firm with limited liability.
Our baseline model analyzes the tradeoff between inside equity and external risky debt. Our
focus on this tradeoff is motivated by the following empirical evidence. Heaton and Lucas (2004)
document the high concentration of equity ownership in entrepreneurial firms and the importance
of debt as a source of outside funding using data from the Survey of Small Business Finances
(SSBF). For example, they report that the principal owner holds on average 81 percent of the
firm’s equity, and the median owner wholly owns the firm. These findings are consistent with
results from earlier Fed surveys of small businesses, as reported in Berger and Udell (1998), Cole
and Wolken (1996), and Petersen and Rajan (1994). Using a large data set of public and private
1
Bitler, Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen (2005) provide evidence that agency considerations play a key role in
explaining why entrepreneurs on average hold large ownership shares.

firms in the United Kingdom, Brav (2009) finds that private firms rely almost exclusively on debt
financing, have higher leverage ratios, and tend to avoid external capital markets, compared to
their public counterparts. Furthermore, Leland and Pyle (1977) show that debt often dominates
equity in settings with asymmetric information because debt is less information-sensitive.
After the firm is set up, the entrepreneur decides when to default on his debt (if the business does
sufficiently poorly), and when to cash out by selling the firm (if the business is doing sufficiently
well). In addition to the business exit decisions, he also chooses consumption and allocates his
liquid wealth between a riskless asset and a diversified market portfolio (as in Merton (1971)).
While the entrepreneur can hedge the systematic component of his business risks using the
market portfolio, he cannot diversify the idiosyncratic risks. Moreover, both default and cashing
out options are costly. Therefore, the entrepreneur faces incomplete markets, and the idiosyncratic
risk exposure has important effects on the entrepreneur’s interdependent consumption, investment,
financing, and business exit decisions.
While the entrepreneur can hedge the systematic component of his business risks using the
market portfolio, he cannot diversify the idiosyncratic risks. Moreover, exit via default or cashing
out is costly. Therefore, the entrepreneur faces incomplete markets, and the idiosyncratic risk
exposure will have important effects on the entrepreneur’s interdependent consumption, investment,
financing, and business exit decisions.
Our main results are as follows. The default option embedded in non-recourse debt allows the
entrepreneur to limit his liability when walking away from his business. Intuitively, the entrepreneur
is long a default (put) option (i.e., a state-contingent sale of the firm to the financier), which is an
insurance to the entrepreneur against the firm’s potential poor performance in the future. Because
the entrepreneur is exposed to the idiosyncratic risk from his concentrated ownership position in the
firm, the diversification benefits of external risky debt are important when markets are incomplete.
The diversification benefits of debt are large. Even without the tax benefits of debt, the entrepreneurial firm still issues a significant amount of debt. The diversification benefits also lead to
a seemingly counterintuitive prediction: more risk-averse entrepreneurs choose higher leverage. On
the one hand, higher leverage increases the risk for the entrepreneur’s equity stake. On the other
hand, higher leverage/debt implies less equity exposure to the entrepreneurial project, making the
entrepreneur’s overall portfolio (including both his private equity in the firm and his liquid financial wealth) less risky. This overall portfolio composition effect dominates the high leverage effect

2

within the firm. The more risk-averse the entrepreneur, the stronger the need to reduce his firm
risk exposure, therefore the higher the leverage.
The non-diversifiable risk and concentrated wealth in the business make the entrepreneur value
his equity less than do diversified investors. The entrepreneur demands an extra premium for bearing the idiosyncratic risks of the firm. Thus, compared to a well-diversified firm, the entrepreneur
tends to default earlier on his debt. While equity is a call option on firm assets, and hence is convex
in firm cash flows, in our model, the private value of equity is not necessarily globally convex. When
risk aversion and/or idiosyncratic volatility are sufficiently high, the entrepreneur’s precautionary
saving demand can make his private value of equity concave in cash flow.
This finding has important implications for risk shifting, an agency problem induced by risky
debt. Jensen and Meckling (1976) point out that managers of public firms have incentives to invest
in excessively risky projects after debt is in place because of the convexity feature of equity. In our
model, when the degree of risk aversion is high enough, the entrepreneur’s private value of equity
(locally) decreases with the idiosyncratic volatility of the project. Thus, he may prefer to invest in
a low idiosyncratic volatility project with debt in place, overturning the asset substitution result of
Jensen and Meckling (1976). We find that, when the firm is not in distress, very low risk aversion
is enough to make the entrepreneur prefer safer projects. Our model thus provides a potential
explanation for the lack of empirical and survey evidence on asset substitution and risk-shifting
incentives.
The standard option valuation analysis is no longer applicable to the default and cash-out options in our setting because these options are non-tradable and their underlying assets are illiquid.
Under the assumption of constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) utility, we provide an analytically
tractable framework to value these options. We also derive an analytical formula for the idiosyncratic risk premium demanded by the entrepreneur. The key determinants of the idiosyncratic risk
premium are risk aversion, idiosyncratic volatility, and the sensitivity of entrepreneurial value of
equity with respect to cash flow. The dynamic properties of the idiosyncratic risk premium are
quite different from the systematic risk premium, especially when the firm is close to default or
cash-out. Moreover, ignoring the idiosyncratic risk premium can lead to substantial downward bias
in the estimates of the leverage ratio of entrepreneurial firms.
Finally, we extend our model to allow the entrepreneur to issue costly external equity. The more
external equity issued, the smaller the entrepreneur’s idiosyncratic risk exposure, but it also creates

3

an incentive problem for the entrepreneur, which lowers the expected growth rate of revenue. We
show that the entrepreneur’s dependence on external debt for diversification decreases when he has
access to external equity. Intuitively, external equity is more effective than debt in transferring
idiosyncratic risks to outside investors. The entrepreneur maximizes his ex ante private value of
the firm by trading off the diversification benefits of equity against the costs of incentive problems.
This paper builds on the insight of Heaton and Lucas (2004), who are the first to model the
diversification benefits of risky debt in a static model with asymmetric information (as in Leland and
Pyle (1977)). We study the entrepreneur’s consumption, portfolio choice, (debt/equity) financing,
and exit (default/cash-out) decisions in a dynamic trade-off model. Our model is tractable and
allows for analytical characterization of the dynamics of debt, equity, and the systematic and
idiosyncratic risk premium demanded by the entrepreneur. We also incorporate a range of realistic
features for entrepreneurial financing, including taxes, cash-out options, and external equity.
We integrate incomplete markets and diversification benefits into the tradeoff model of Leland (1994), thus bringing a new dimension to the structural credit risk/capital structure models.2
Our generalized tradeoff model not only applies to entrepreneurs, but also to public firms with
under-diversified managers. Our model is related to the incomplete-markets consumption smoothing/precautionary saving literature.3 For analytical tractability reasons, we adopt the CARA utility
specification as in Merton (1971), Caballero (1991), Kimball and Mankiw (1989), and Wang (2006).
Our model contributes to this literature by extending the CARA-utility-based precautionary saving
problem to allow the entrepreneur to reduce his idiosyncratic risk exposure via exit strategies such
as cash-out and default.
This paper is also related to the real options literature.4 The closest paper is Miao and Wang
(2007), who analyze the impact of the entrepreneur’s non-diversifiable idiosyncratic risks on his
growth option exercising decision. The present paper analyzes the entrepreneurial firm’s investment
and financing (internal versus external, debt versus equity), and endogenous default and cash-out
decisions.

Model setup

Investment opportunities

An infinitely-lived risk-averse agent has a take-it-or-leave-it project

at time 0, which requires a one-time investment I. The project generates a stochastic revenue
process {yt : t ≥ 0} that follows a geometric Brownian motion (GBM):
dyt = µyt dt + ωyt dBt + ǫyt dZt , y0 given,

(1)

where µ is the expected growth rate of the revenue, Bt and Zt are independent standard Brownian
motions, which are the sources of market (systematic) and idiosyncratic risks of the private business,
respectively. The parameters ω and ǫ are the systematic and idiosyncratic volatility parameters of
the revenue growth. The total volatility of revenue growth is
σ=

p

ω 2 + ǫ2 .

(2)

As we will show, these different volatility parameters ω, ǫ, and σ have different effects on the
entrepreneur’s decision making.
In addition, the agent has access to standard financial investment opportunities as in Merton
(1971).5 The agent allocates his liquid financial wealth between a riskfree asset which pays a
constant rate of interest r and a diversified market portfolio (the risky asset) with returns Rt
satisfying:
dRt = µp dt + σp dBt ,

(3)

where µp and σp are the expected return and volatility of the risky asset, respectively, and Bt is
the standard Brownian motion introduced earlier. Let
η=

µp − r
σp

(4)

denote the after-tax Sharpe ratio of the market portfolio, and let {xt : t ≥ 0} denote the entrepreneur’s liquid (financial) wealth process. The entrepreneur invests the amount φt in the
market portfolio (the risky asset) and the remaining amount xt − φt in the riskfree asset.
Entrepreneurial firm If the entrepreneur decides to start the project, he runs it by setting up
a limited-liability entity, such as a limited liability company (LLC) or an S corporation. The LLC
5
It is straightforward to consider entering the labor market as an alternative to running entrepreneurial business,
which provides an endogenous opportunity cost of taking on the entrepreneurial project. Such an extension does not
change key economics of our paper in any significant way.

5

or S corporation allows the entrepreneur to face single-layer taxation for his business income and
makes the debt non-recourse. We may extend the model to allow for personal guarantee of debt to
varying degrees. This feature effectively makes debt recourse to varying degrees. The entrepreneur
finances the initial one-time lump-sum cost I via his own funds (internal financing) and external
financing. In the benchmark case, we assume that the only source of external financing is debt. See
Petersen and Rajan (2002), Heaton and Lucas (2004), and Brav (2009) for evidence that debt is
the primary source of financing for most entrepreneurial firms.6 One interpretation of the external
debt is bank loans. The entrepreneur uses the firm’s assets as collateral to borrow, so that the debt
is secured.
We assume that debt is issued at par and is interest-only (consol) for tractability reasons as
in Leland (1994) and Duffie and Lando (2001). Let b denote the coupon payment of debt and F0
denote the par value of debt. Debt is priced competitively in that the lender breaks even on the
risk-adjusted basis. We further assume that debt is only issued at time 0 and remains unchanged
until the entrepreneur exits. Allowing for dynamic capital structure before exit will not change
the key economic tradeoff that we focus on: the impact of idiosyncratic risk on entrepreneurial
financing decisions.
After debt is in place, at any time t > 0, the entrepreneur has three choices: (1) continuing
his business; (2) defaulting on the outstanding debt, which leads to the liquidation of his firm; (3)
cashing out by selling the firm to a diversified buyer.
While running the business, the entrepreneur receives income from the firm in the form of
cash payments (operating profit net of coupon payments). Negative cash payments are interpreted
as cash injections by the entrepreneur into the firm. Notice that trading riskless bonds and the
diversified market portfolio alone does not help the entrepreneur diversify the idiosyncratic business
risk. He can sell the firm and cash out, which requires a fixed transaction cost K. The default
timing Td and cash-out timing Tu are not contractible at time 0. Instead, the entrepreneur chooses
the default/cash-out policy to maximize his own utility after he chooses the time-0 debt level. Thus,
there is an inevitable conflict of interest between financiers and the entrepreneur. The choices of
default and cash-out resemble American-style put and call options on the underlying non-tradeable
entrepreneurial firm. Since markets are incomplete for the entrepreneur, we cannot price the
entrepreneur’s options using the standard dynamic replication argument (Black-Scholes-Merton).
6

In Section VII, we introduce external equity as an additional source of financing.

6

At bankruptcy, the outside lender takes control and liquidates/sells the firm. Bankruptcy ex post
is costly as in standard tradeoff models of capital structure. We assume that the liquidation/sale
value of the firm is equal to a fraction α of the value of an all equity (unlevered) public firm, A (y).
The remaining fraction (1 − α) is lost due to bankruptcy costs. We also assume that absolute
priority is enforced, and abstract away from any ex post renegotiation between the lender and the
entrepreneur.
Before the entrepreneur can sell the firm, he needs to retire the firm’s debt obligation at par
F0 . We make the standard assumption that the buyer is well diversified. He will optimally relever
the firm as in the complete-markets model of Leland (1994). The value of the firm after sale is the
value of an optimally levered public firm, V ∗ (y).
After the entrepreneur exits from his business (through default or cash-out), he “retires” and
lives on his financial income. He then faces a standard complete-markets consumption and portfolio
choice problem.7
Taxes We consider a simple tax environment. The entrepreneurial firm pays taxes on his business
profits at rate τe . When τe > 0, issuing debt has the benefit of shielding part of the entrepreneur’s
business profits from taxes. For a public firm, the effective marginal tax rate is τm . Unlike the
entrepreneurial firm, the public firm is subject to double taxation (at the corporate and individual
levels), and τm captures the net tax rate (following Miller (1977)). Finally, τg denotes the tax
rate on the capital gains upon sale. Naturally, higher capital gain taxes will delay the timing of
cash-out.
Entrepreneur’s objective

The entrepreneur derives utility from consumption {ct : t ≥ 0} ac-

cording to the following time-additive utility function:
Z ∞

E
e−δt u (ct ) dt ,

(5)

0

where δ > 0 is the entrepreneur’s subjective discount rate and u( · ) is an increasing and concave
function. The entrepreneur’s objective is to maximize his lifetime utility by optimally choosing
consumption (ct ), financial portfolio (φt ), and whether to start his business. If he starts his business,
he also chooses the financing structure of the firm (coupon b), and the subsequent timing decisions
of default and cash-out (Td , Tu ).
7

Extending our model to allow for sequential rounds of entrepreneurial activities will complicate our analysis. We
leave this extension for future research.

7

In general, incomplete markets imply that the entrepreneur cannot fully diversify his business
risk and hence cannot fully separate his investment from consumption decisions. Indeed, provided
that u′ (c) is convex, the entrepreneur’s precautionary motive will determine his intertemporal
consumption smoothing.8

Model solution

First, in Section III.A, we report the complete-markets solution for firm value and financing decisions when the firm is owned by diversified investors. Then, we analyze the entrepreneur’s interdependent consumption/saving, portfolio choice, default, and initial investment and financing
decisions. The complete-markets solution of Section III.A serves as a natural benchmark for us to
analyze the impact of non-diversifiable idiosyncratic risk on entrepreneurial investment, financing
and valuation.

3.1

Complete-markets firm valuation and financing policy

Consider a public firm owned by diversified investors. Because equityholders internalize the benefits
and costs of debt issuance, they will choose the firm’s debt policy to maximize ex ante firm value
by trading off the tax benefits of debt against bankruptcy and agency costs. The results in this
case are well-known.9 In Appendix A, we provide the after-tax value of an unlevered public firm
A(y) in equation (A.19), and the after-tax value of a public levered firm V ∗ (y) in equation (A.21).
Next, we turn to analyze the entrepreneur’s decision problem before he exits from his business.

3.2

Entrepreneur’s problem

The significant lack of diversification invalidates the standard finance textbook valuation analysis for
firms owned by diversified investors. As a result, the standard two-step complete-markets (ArrowDebreu) analysis10 (i.e., first value maximization and then optimal consumption allocation) no
longer applies. This non-separability between value maximization and consumption smoothing has
important implications for real economic activities (e.g., investment and capital budgeting) and the
valuation of claims that an entrepreneur issues to finance his investment activities.
8

Leland (1968) is among the earliest studies on precautionary saving models. Kimball (1990) links the degree of
precautionary saving to the convexity of the marginal utility function u′ (c).
9
For example, see Leland (1994), Goldstein, Ju, and Leland (2001), and Miao (2005).
10
Cox and Huang (1989) apply this insight to separate intertemporal portfolio choices from consumption in
continuous-time diffusion settings.

8

We solve the entrepreneur’s problem by backward induction. First, we summarize the entrepreneur’s consumption/saving and portfolio choice problem after he retires from his business via
either cashing out or defaulting on debt. This “retirement-stage” optimization problem is the same
as in Merton (1971), a dynamic complete-markets consumption/portfolio choice problem. Second,
we solve the entrepreneur’s joint consumption/saving, portfolio choice, and default decisions when
the entrepreneur runs his private business. Third, we determine the entrepreneur’s exit decisions
(his cash-out and default boundaries) by comparing his value functions just before and after retirement. Finally, we solve the entrepreneur’s initial (time-0) investment and financing decisions
taking his future decisions into account.
Conceptually, our model setup applies to any utility function u(c) under technical regularity
conditions. For analytical tractability, we adopt the CARA utility throughout the remainder of
the paper.11 That is, let u (c) = −e−γc /γ, where γ > 0 is coefficient of absolute risk aversion,
which also measures precautionary motive. We emphasize that the main results and insights of
our paper (the effect of non-diversifiable idiosyncratic shocks on investment timing) do not rely
on the choice of this utility function. As we show below, the driving force of our results is the
precautionary savings effect, which is captured by utility functions with convex marginal utility such
as CARA. While CARA utility does not capture wealth effects, it helps reduce the dimension of our
double-barrier free-boundary problem, which makes the problem much more tractable compared
to constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility.
Consumption/saving and portfolio choice after exit.

After exiting from his business (via

either default or cash-out), the entrepreneur no longer has any business income, and lives on his
financial wealth. The entrepreneur’s optimization problem becomes the standard complete-market
consumption and portfolio choice problem (e.g., Merton (1971)). We summarize the results in
Appendix B.
Entrepreneur’s decision making while running the firm.

We summarize the solution for

consumption/saving, portfolio choice, default trigger yd , and cash-out trigger yu in the following
theorem.
11

The CARA utility specification proves tractable in incomplete-markets consumption-saving problems with labor
income. Kimball and Mankiw (1989), Caballero (1991), Svensson and Werner (1993), and Wang (2006) have all
adopted this utility specification in various precautionary saving models. Miao and Wang (2007) use this utility
specification to analyze a real option exercising problem when the decision maker faces uninsurable idiosyncratic risk
from his investment opportunity.

9

Theorem 1 The entrepreneur exits from his business when the revenue process {yt : t ≥ 0} reaches
either the default threshold yd or the cash-out threshold yu , whichever comes first. Prior to exit,
for given liquid wealth x and revenue y, he chooses his consumption and portfolio rules as follows:

where G(·) and yd solve the free boundary problem given by the differential equation:

(8)

subject to the following (free) boundary conditions:
G(yd ) = 0

(9a)

G′ (yd ) = 0

(9b)

G(yu ) = V ∗ (yu ) − F0 − K − τg (V ∗ (yu ) − K − I)

(9c)

G′ (yu ) = (1 − τg )V ∗′ (yu )

(9d)

where complete-markets firm value V ∗ (y) is defined in (A.21), and the value of external debt F0 =
F (y0 ) is given in (C.6).
Equation (6) states that consumption is equal to the annuity value of the sum of financial wealth
x, certainty equivalent wealth G(y), and two constant terms capturing the effects of the expected
excess returns and the wedge δ−r on consumption. The key is to note that G(y) is the risk-adjusted
subjective valuation of the entrepreneur’s business project. Equation (7) gives the entrepreneur’s
portfolio holding, where the first term is the standard mean-variance term as in Merton (1971),
and the second term gives the entrepreneur’s hedging demand as he uses the market portfolio to
dynamically hedge the entrepreneurial business risk.
The differential equation (8) provides a valuation equation for the certainty equivalent wealth
G(y) from the entrepreneur’s perspective. In the standard CAPM model, only systematic risk
demands a risk premium under the complete-markets setting. Since the systematic volatility of
revenue growth is ω, the risk-adjusted expected growth rate of revenue in the CAPM model is
ν = µ − ωη.

10

(10)

If we drop the last nonlinear term in (8), the differential equation becomes the standard pricing
equation: setting the instantaneous expected return of an asset under the risk-neutral measure
(RHS) equal to the riskfree rate (LHS). The last term in (8) captures the additional discount due
to the non-diversifiable idiosyncratic risk. Intuitively, the higher the risk aversion parameter γ or
the idiosyncratic volatility ǫy, the larger the discount on G(y) due to idiosyncratic risk. The next
section provides more detailed analysis on the impact of idiosyncratic risk on G(y).
Equation (9a) comes from the value-matching condition for the entrepreneur’s default decision.
It states that the private value of equity G(y) upon default is equal to zero. Equation (9b), often
referred to as the smooth-pasting condition, can be interpreted as the optimality condition for the
entrepreneur in choosing default.
Now we turn to the cash-out boundary. Because the entrepreneur pays the fixed cost K and
triggers capital gains when cashing out, he naturally has incentive to wait before cashing out. However, waiting also reduces his diversification benefits ceteris paribus. The entrepreneur optimally
trades off tax implications, diversification benefits, and transaction costs when choosing the timing
of cashing out. The value-matching condition (9c) at the cash-out boundary states that the private
value of equity upon the firm’s cashing out is equal to the after-tax value of the public firm value
after the entrepreneur pays the fixed costs K, retires outstanding debt at par F0 , and pays capital
gains taxes. The smooth-pasting condition (9d) ensures that the entrepreneur optimally chooses
his cash-out decision.
Initial financing and investment decisions.

Next, we complete the model solution by endo-

genizing the entrepreneur’s initial investment and financing decision. The entrepreneurial firm has
two financial claimants: inside equity (entrepreneur) and outside creditors. The entrepreneur values his ownership at a certainty equivalent value G(y). Diversified lenders price debt in competitive
capital markets at F (y), which does not contain the idiosyncratic risk premium because outside
investors are fully diversified. Thus, the total private value of the entrepreneurial firm is
S(y) = G(y) + F (y).

(11)

We may interpret S(y) as the total value that an investor needs to pay in order to acquire the
entrepreneurial firm by buying out the entrepreneur and the debt investors.
At time 0, the entrepreneur thus chooses debt coupon b to maximize the private value of the

11

firm:
b∗ = argmax S (y0 ; b) .

(12)

b

Intuitively, the entrepreneur internalizes the benefits and costs of debt financing, and markets
competitively price the firm’s debt. In Appendix B, we show that (12) indeed arises from the
entrepreneur’s utility maximization problem stated in (B.18). Note the conflicts of interest between
the entrepreneur and external financiers. After debt is in place, the entrepreneur will no longer
maximize the total value of the firm S(y), but his private value of equity G(y). Theorem 1 has
already captured the conflict of interest between the entrepreneur and outside creditors.
The last step is to characterize whether the agent wants to undertake the project. He makes
the investment and starts up the firm at time 0 if his life-time utility with the project is higher
than that without the project. This is equivalent to the condition that S (y0 ) > I.
We may interpret our model’s implication on capital structure as a generalized tradeoff model
of capital structure for the entrepreneurial firm, where the entrepreneur trades off the benefits
of outside debt financing (diversification and potential tax implications) against the costs of debt
financing (bankruptcy and agency conflicts between the entrepreneur and outside lenders). The
natural measure of leverage from the entrepreneur’s point of view is the ratio between the public
value of debt F (y) and the private value of firm S(y),
L(y) =

F (y)
.
S(y)

(13)

We label L(y) as private leverage to reflect the impact of idiosyncratic risk on the leverage choice.
Note that the entrepreneur’s preferences (e.g., risk aversion) influence the firm’s capital structure.
The standard argument that shareholders can diversify for themselves and hence diversification
plays no role in the capital structure decisions of public firms is no longer valid for entrepreneurial
firms.
So far, we have focused on the parameter regions where the entrepreneur first establishes his
firm as a private business and finances its operation via an optimal mix of outside debt and inside
equity. We now point out two special cases. First, when the cost of cashing out is sufficiently
small, it is optimal for the entrepreneur to sell the firm immediately (yu = y0 ). The other special
case is when asset recovery rate is sufficiently high, or the entrepreneur is sufficiently risk averse,
so that he raises as much debt as possible and defaults immediately (yd = y0 ). Both cases lead to
immediate exit. In our analysis below, we consider parameter values that rule out these cases.

Risky debt, endogenous default, and diversification

We now investigate a special case of the model in Theorem 1 which highlights the diversification
benefits of risky debt. For this purpose, we shut down the cash-out option (by setting the cash-out
cost K to infinity, making the cash-out option worthless).
We use the following (annualized) baseline parameter values: riskfree interest rate r = 3%,
expected growth rate of revenue µ = 4%, systematic volatility of growth rate ω = 10%, idiosyncratic
volatility ε = 20%, market price of risk η = 0.4, and asset recovery rate α = 0.6. We set the
effective marginal Miller tax rate τm to 11.29% as in Graham (2000) and Hackbarth, Hennessy,
and Leland (2007).12 In our baseline parametrization, we set τe = 0, which reflects the fact that
the entrepreneur can avoid taxes on his business income completely by deducting various expenses.
Shutting down the tax benefits also allows us to highlight the diversification benefits of debt. Later,
we consider the case where τe = τm , which can be directly compared with the complete-markets
model. We set the entrepreneur’s rate of time preference δ = 3%, and consider three values of the
risk aversion parameter γ ∈ {0, 1, 2}. Finally, we set the initial level of revenue y0 = 1.
Private value of equity G(y) and default threshold.

Figure 1 plots private value of equity

G(y) and its derivative G′ (y) as functions of y. The top and the bottom panels plot the results for
τe = 0 and τe = τm , respectively. When τe = 0, the entrepreneur with very low risk aversion (γ → 0,
effectively complete-markets) issues no debt, because there are neither tax benefits (τe = 0) nor
diversification benefits (γ → 0). Equity value is equal to the present discounted value of future cash
flows (the straight dash line shown in the top-left panel). A risk-averse entrepreneur has incentive
to issue debt in order to diversify idiosyncratic risks. The entrepreneur defaults when y falls to yd ,
the point where G (yd ) = G′ (yd ) = 0. When τe = τm , the entrepreneurial firm issues debt to take
advantage of tax benefits in addition to diversification benefits. The bottom two panels of Figure
1 plot this case.
The derivative G′ (y) measures the sensitivity of private value of equity G(y) with respect to
revenue y. As expected, private value of equity G(y) increases with revenue y, i.e., G′ (y) > 0.
Analogous to Black-Scholes-Merton’s observation that firm equity is a call option on firm assets,
the entrepreneur’s private equity G(y) also has a call option feature. For example, in the bottom
12

We may interpret τm as the effective Miller tax rate which integrates the corporate income tax, individual’s
equity and interest income tax. Using the Miller’s formula for the effective tax rate , and setting the interest income
tax at 0.30, corporate income tax at 0.31, and the individual’s long-term equity (distribution) tax at 0.10, we obtain
an effective tax rate of 11.29%.

panels of Figure 1 (τe = τm ), when γ approaches 0 (complete markets case), equity value is convex
in revenue y, reflecting its call option feature.
Unlike the standard Black-Scholes-Merton paradigm, neither the entrepreneurial equity nor the
firm is tradable. When the risk-averse entrepreneur cannot fully diversify his project’s idiosyncratic
risks, the global convexity of G(y) no longer holds, as shown in Figure 1 for cases where γ > 0.
The entrepreneur now has precautionary saving demand to partially buffer against the project’s
non-diversifiable idiosyncratic shocks. This precautionary saving effect induces concavity in G(y).
When revenue y is large, the precautionary saving effect is large due to high idiosyncratic volatility
ǫy, and the option (convexity) effect is small because the default option is further out of the money.
Therefore, the precautionary saving effect dominates the option effect for sufficiently high y, making
G(y) concave in y for high y. The opposite is true for low y, where the convexity effect dominates.

The precautionary saving effect also causes a more risk-averse entrepreneur to discount cash
flows at a higher rate. For a given level of coupon b, the entrepreneur values his inside equity
lower (smaller G(y)), thus is more willing to default and walk away. Moreover, a more risk-averse
entrepreneur also has a stronger incentive to diversify idiosyncratic risks by selling a bigger share
of his firm, which implies a larger coupon b, a higher default threshold, and a higher debt value,
ceteris paribus. The two effects reinforce each other. Figure 1 confirms that both G(y) and the
default threshold yd increase with risk aversion γ.
Capital structure for entrepreneurial firms. First, we consider the special case where risky
debt only offers diversification benefits for the entrepreneur and has no tax benefits (τe = 0). Then,
we incorporate the tax benefits of debt into our analysis.
The top panel in Table 1 provides results for the entrepreneurial firm’s capital structure when
τe = 0. If the entrepreneur is very close to being risk neutral (γ → 0), the model’s prediction is
essentially the same as the complete-market benchmark. In this case, the standard tradeoff theory
of capital structure implies that the entrepreneurial firm will be entirely financed by equity (since
debt provides no benefits). The risk-neutral entrepreneur values the firm at its market value 33.33.

15

For γ = 1, the entrepreneur borrows F0 = 8.28 in market value with coupon b = 0.31, and values
his non-tradable equity G0 at 14.39, giving the private value of the firm S0 = 22.68. The drop in S0
is substantial (from 33.33 to 22.68, or about 32%) when increasing γ from zero to one. This drop
in S0 is mainly due to the risk-averse entrepreneur’s discount of his non-tradable equity position
for bearing non-diversifiable idiosyncratic business risks. The default risk of debt contributes little
to the reduction of S0 (the 10-year cumulative default probability rises from 0 to 0.4% only).
In Section III, we introduced the natural measure of leverage for entrepreneurial firms: private
leverage L0 , given by the ratio of public debt value F0 to private value of the firm S0 . Private
leverage L0 naturally arises from the entrepreneur’s maximization problem and captures the entrepreneur’s tradeoff between private value of equity and public value of debt in choosing debt
coupon policy. For γ = 1, the private leverage ratio is about 36.5%.
With a higher risk aversion level γ = 2, the entrepreneur borrows more (F0 = 14.66) with a
higher coupon (b = 0.68). He values his remaining non-tradable equity at G0 = 5.89, and the
implied private leverage ratio L0 = 71.3% is much higher than 36.5%, the value for γ = 1. The
more risk-averse entrepreneur takes on more leverage, because he has stronger incentive to sell more
of the firm to achieve greater diversification benefits. With greater risk aversion, default is more
likely (the 10-year cumulative default probability is 12.1%), and the credit spread is higher (166
basis points over the riskfree rate).
Next, we incorporate the effect of tax benefits for the entrepreneur into our generalized tradeoff
model of capital structure for entrepreneurial firms. To compare with the complete-markets benchmark, we set τe = τm = 11.29%. Therefore, the only difference between an entrepreneurial firm
and a public firm is that the entrepreneur faces non-diversifiable idiosyncratic risks.
The first row of the lower panel of Table 1 gives the results for the complete-markets benchmark.
Facing positive corporate tax rates, the public firm wants to issue debt, but is also concerned with
bankruptcy costs. The optimal tradeoff for the public firm is to issue debt at the competitive
market value F0 = 9.29 with coupon b = 0.35. The implied initial leverage is 30.9% and the 10-year
cumulative default probability is tiny (0.3%).
Similar to the case with τe = 0, an entrepreneur facing non-diversifiable idiosyncratic risks
wants to issue more risky debt to diversify these risks. The second panel of Table 1 shows that the
entrepreneur with γ = 1 borrows 14.85 (with the coupon rate b = 0.68), higher than the level for the
public firm. The private leverage more than doubles to 67.9%. Not surprisingly, the entrepreneur

faces a higher default probability and the credit spread of his debt is also higher. With γ = 2, debt
issuance increases to 16.50, and private leverage increases to 81.4%.
Determinants of capital structure decisions.

To further demonstrate the important role of

idiosyncratic risks in determining the capital structure of entrepreneurial firms, we now turn to two
comparisons.
First, consider an econometrician who has correctly identified the entrepreneurial firm’s debt
coupon b = 0.85 and default threshold yd = 0.47, but does not realize that the entrepreneur’s
subjective valuation G(y; b, yd ) is lower than the corresponding public equity value E(y; b, yd ) due
to non-diversifiable idiosyncratic risk. Indeed, he assigns the entrepreneur’s equity with a value
at E0 = 11.10 instead of the subjective valuation G0 = 3.77, thus obtaining a leverage ratio of
59.8%, substantially lower than the entrepreneur’s private leverage L0 = 81.4%. The large difference between the private and market leverage ratios highlights the economic significance of taking
idiosyncratic risks into account. Simply put, standard corporate finance methodology potentially
underestimates the leverage of entrepreneurial firms.
Second, we highlight the impact of the entrepreneur’s endogenous default decision. The public and the entrepreneurial firms have significantly different leverage decisions because both debt
issuance and default decisions on debt (given the same level of debt coupon outstanding) are different. To see the quantitative effects of endogenous default decisions on leverage, we hold the
coupon rate on outstanding debt fixed. That is, consider a public firm that has the same technology/environment parameters as the entrepreneurial firm. Moreover, the two firms have the same
17

debt coupons (b = 0.85).
Facing the same coupon b = 0.85, the public firm defaults when revenue reaches the default
threshold yd = 0.35, which is lower than the threshold yd = 0.47 for the entrepreneurial firm.
Intuitively, facing the same coupon b, the entrepreneurial firm defaults earlier than the public firm
because of the entrepreneur’s aversion to non-diversifiable idiosyncratic risk. The implied shorter
distance-to-default for the entrepreneurial firm translates into a higher 10-year default probability
(22% for the entrepreneurial firm versus 10% for the public firm) and a higher credit spread (213
basis points for the entrepreneurial firm versus 178 basis points for the public firm). Defaulting
optimally for the public firm raises its value from S0 = 27.60 to S0 = 29.26.
The preceding two comparisons help explain the differences in leverage ratios between the entrepreneurial firm and the public firm. First, fixing both the coupon and the default threshold, the
entrepreneur’s subjective valuation (due to non-diversifiable risks) has significant impact on the implied leverage ratio. Ignoring subjective valuation substantially underestimates the entrepreneurial
firm’s leverage. Second, facing the same coupon, the entrepreneurial firm defaults earlier than the
public firm, which reduces the value of debt and lowers the leverage ratio, but the quantitative effect
seems small. Third, diversification motives make the entrepreneur issue more debt than the public
firm, which further raises the leverage ratio of the entrepreneurial firm. While the numerical results
are parameter specific, the analysis provides support for our intuition that the entrepreneur’s need
for diversification and subjective valuation discount for bearing non-diversifiable idiosyncratic risks
are key determinants of the private leverage for an entrepreneurial firm.

Cash-out option as an alternative channel of diversification

We now turn to a richer and more realistic setting where the entrepreneur can diversify idiosyncratic
risks through both the default and cash-out options. The entrepreneur avoids the downside risk
by defaulting if the firm’s stochastic revenue falls to a sufficiently low level. In addition, when the
firm does well enough, the entrepreneur may want to capitalize on the upside by selling the firm to
diversified investors.
In addition to the baseline parameter values from Section IV, we set the effective capital gains
tax rate from selling the business τg = 10%, reflecting the tax deferral advantage of the tax timing
option.13 We set the initial investment cost for the project I = 10, which is 1/3 of the market
13

In Appendix D.1, we investigate the effects of different capital gain taxes.

probability of about 20% (with γ = 2), consistent with the success rates of venture capital firms
(Hall and Woodward (2008)).
Cash-out option: Crowding out debt.

Figure 2 plots the private value of equity G(y) and

its first derivative G′ (y) for an entrepreneur with risk aversion γ = 1 when he has the option to
cash out. The function G (y) smoothly touches the horizontal axis on the left and the dash line
denoting the value of cashing out on the right. The two tangent points give the default and cash-out
thresholds, respectively. For sufficiently low values of revenue y, the private value of equity G(y) is
increasing and convex because the default option is deep in the money. For sufficiently high values
of y, G(y) is also increasing and convex because the cash-out option is deep in the money. For
revenue y in the intermediate range, neither default nor cash-out option is deep in the money. In
this range, the precautionary saving motive may be large enough to induce concavity. As shown in
the right panel of Figure 1, G′ (y) first increases for low values of y, then decreases for intermediate
values of y, and finally increases for high values of y.
Table 3 provides the capital structure information of an entrepreneurial firm with both cashout and default options. For brevity, we only report the results for the case τe = τm . When the
market is complete, the firm’s cash-out option is essentially an option to adjust the firm’s capital

structure (recall that there is no diversification benefit for public firms). In this case, given our
calibrated fixed cost K, the 10-year cash-out probability is essentially zero and hence this option
value is close to zero for the public firm. Therefore, we expect that the bulk of the cash-out option
value for entrepreneurial firms comes from the diversification benefits, not from the option value of
readjusting leverage.
For a risk-averse entrepreneur, the prospect of cashing out lowers the firm’s incentive to issue
debt. When γ = 1, debt coupon is b = 0.55, lower than the level b = 0.68 for the firm which only
has the default option. The private leverage ratio L0 at issuance is 56.5%, with a credit spread
at 138 basis points, compared to the private leverage ratio L0 = 67.9% and credit spread of 159
basis points when the firm only has the default option. The 10-year default probability is close
to zero, but the 10-year cash-out probability is 12.3%, which is economically significant (recall
that the 10-year cash-out probability for a public firm is zero). For more risk averse entrepreneurs
(e.g., γ = 2), the private leverage ratio is 68.7%, smaller than 81.4% for the setting without the
cash-out option. Given the opportunity to sell his business to public investors, the entrepreneur
substitutes away from risky debt and relies more on the future potential of cashing out to diversify
his idiosyncratic risks.
Idiosyncratic risk, leverage, and risk premium.

We now turn to the impact of idiosyncratic

volatility on leverage and risk premium. Figure 3 shows its effect on leverage. In complete-markets
models, an increase in (idiosyncratic) volatility ǫ raises default risk, hence the market leverage

The remaining parameters are the same as in Table 3.

ratio and the coupon rate for the public firm decrease with idiosyncratic volatility. By contrast,
risk-averse entrepreneurs take on more debt to diversify their idiosyncratic risks when ǫ is higher.
For γ = 1, both coupon and leverage become monotonically increasing in ǫ. This result implies
that the private leverage ratio for entrepreneurial firms increases with idiosyncratic volatility even
for mild risk aversion.
For public firms, risk premium is determined by the firm’s non-diversifiable systematic risk.
For entrepreneurial firm, both systematic and idiosyncratic risks matter for the firm’s investment
decisions. Without loss of generality, we decompose the entrepreneur’s risk premium into two components: the systematic risk premium π s (y) and the idiosyncratic risk premium π i (y). Rearranging
the valuation equation (8) gives:

risk premium.14
Unlike π s (y), the idiosyncratic risk premium π i (y) defined in (15) directly depends on risk
aversion γ and (ǫyG′ (y))2 , the conditional (idiosyncratic) variance of the entrepreneur’s equity
G(y). The conditional (idiosyncratic) variance term reflects the fact that the idiosyncratic risk
premium π i (y) is determined by the entrepreneur’s precautionary saving demand, which depends
on the conditional variance of idiosyncratic risks (Caballero (1991) and Wang (2006)).
We examine the behavior of these risk premia in Figure 4. The entrepreneur’s equity is a
levered position in the firm. When the firm approaches default, the systematic component of the
risk premium π s (y) behaves similarly to the standard valuation model. That is, the significant
leverage effect around the default boundary implies that the systematic risk premium diverges to
Despite this standard interpretation for the systematic risk premium, it is worth pointing out that π s (y) also
indirectly reflects the non-diversifiable idiosyncratic risks that the entrepreneur bears, and risk aversion γ indirectly
affects π s (y) through its impact on G (y) .

infinity when y approaches yd . When the firm approaches the cash-out threshold, the cash-out
option makes the firm value more sensitive to cash flow shocks, which also tends to raise the
systematic risk premium.
The idiosyncratic risk premium π i (y) behaves quite differently. Figure 4 indicates that the
idiosyncratic risk premium is small when the firm is close to default, and it increases with y for most
values of y. The intuition is as follows. The numerator in (15) reflects the agent’s precautionary
saving demand, which depends on the conditional idiosyncratic variance of the changes in the
certainty equivalent value of equity G(y) and risk aversion γ. Both the conditional idiosyncratic
variance and G(y) increase with y. When y is large, the conditional idiosyncratic variance rises fast
relative to G(y), generating a large idiosyncratic risk premium.

Project choice: asset substitution versus risk sharing

Jensen and Meckling (1976) point out that there is an incentive problem associated with risky
debt: After debt is in place, managers have incentive to take on riskier projects to take advantage
of the option-type of payoff structure of equity. However, there is little empirical evidence in
support of such risk shifting behaviors.15 One possible explanation is that managerial risk aversion
can potentially dominate the risk shifting incentives. Our model provides a natural setting to
investigate these two competing effects quantitatively.
We consider the following project choice problem. Suppose the risk-averse entrepreneur can
choose among a continuum of mutually exclusive projects with different idiosyncratic volatilities ǫ
in the interval [ǫmin , ǫmax ] after debt is in place. Let F0 be the market value of existing debt with
the coupon payment b. The entrepreneur then chooses idiosyncratic volatility ǫ+ ∈ [ǫmin , ǫmax ]
to maximize his own utility. As shown in Section III, the entrepreneur effectively chooses ǫ+ to
maximize his private value of equity G(y0 ), taking the debt contract (b, F0 ) as given. Let this
maximized value be G+ (y0 ).
In a rational expectations equilibrium, the lender anticipates the entrepreneur’s ex post incentive
of choosing the level of idiosyncratic volatility ǫ+ to maximize G(y0 ), and prices the initial debt
contract accordingly in competitive capital markets. Therefore, the entrepreneur ex ante maximizes
the private value of the firm, S(y0 ) = G+ (y0 ) + F0 , taking the competitive market debt pricing into
account. We solve this joint investment and financing (fixed-point) problem.

Figure 5: Private equity value as function of idiosyncratic volatility after optimal debt
is in place. This figure plots the private value of equity for different choices of idiosyncratic volatility
ǫ after debt issuance. The coupon is fixed at the optimal value corresponding to given risk aversion. We
assume ǫmin = 0.05, ǫmax = 0.35. The remaining parameters are the same as in Table 3.

Figure 5 illustrates the solution of this optimization problem. We set ǫmin = 0.05, ǫmax = 0.35.
When γ → 0, the entrepreneur chooses the highest idiosyncratic volatility project with ǫmax = 0.35.
The optimal coupon payment is 0.297. In this case, the entrepreneur effectively faces complete
markets. The Jensen and Meckling (1976) argument applies because the market value of equity
is convex and the ex post risk shifting problem arises. When the entrepreneur is risk averse, he
demands a premium for bearing the non-diversifiable idiosyncratic risks, which tends to lower his
private value of equity G (y0 ). When this effect dominates, the entrepreneur prefers projects with
lower idiosyncratic volatility. For example, for γ = 1, the entrepreneur chooses the project with
ǫmin = 0.05, with the corresponding optimal coupon payment 0.491. Even when the degree of risk
aversion is low (e.g., γ = 0.1, which implies an idiosyncratic risk premium of 2 basis points for
ǫ = 0.05, or 20 basis points for ǫ = 0.20), we still find that the risk aversion effect dominates the
risk shifting incentive.
From this numerical example, we find that in our model, even with low risk aversion, the
precautionary saving incentive tends to dominate the asset substitution incentive in normal times.
Note that our argument applies to public firms as well, provided that: (i) managerial compensation
is tied to firm performance; (ii) managers are not fully diversified, behave in their own interests,

24

and are entrenched. Thus, the lack of empirical evidence supporting asset substitution may be
simply due to the non-diversifiable idiosyncratic risks faced by risk-averse decision makers.

External equity

While debt is the primary source of financing for most entrepreneurial (small-business) firms, hightech startups are often financed by venture capital, which often use external equity in various forms
as the primary source of financing. This financing choice particularly makes sense when the liquidation value of firm’s assets is low (e.g., computer software firms), and incentive alignments are more
important. Hall and Woodward (2008) provide a quantitative analysis for the lack of diversification
of venture-capital-backed entrepreneurial firms. In this section, we extend the baseline model of
Section II by allowing the entrepreneur to issue external equity at t = 0, and study the effect of
external equity on the diversification benefits of risky debt.16
If it is costless to issue external equity, a risk-averse entrepreneur will want to sell the entire
firm to the VC right away. We motivate the costs of external equity through the agency problems
of Jensen and Meckling (1976). Intuitively, the more concentrated the entrepreneur’s ownership is,
the better incentive alignment (Berle and Means (1931) and Jensen and Meckling (1976)). Let ψ
denote the fraction of equity that the entrepreneur retains and hence 1 − ψ denote the fraction of
external equity. Consider the expected growth rate of revenue µ in equation (1). We capture the
incentive problem of ownership in reduced form by making µ an increasing and concave function
of the entrepreneur’s ownership ψ (i.e., µ′ (ψ) > 0 and µ′′ (ψ) < 0). Intuitively, the concavity
relation suggests that the incremental value from incentive alignment becomes lower as ownership
concentration rises, ceteris paribus.
More specifically, we model the growth rate µ as a quadratic function of the entrepreneur’s
ownership ψ, µ(ψ) = −0.02ψ 2 + 0.04ψ + 0.03, with ψ ∈ [0, 1]. This functional form is chosen such
that the maximum expected growth rate is 5%, when the entrepreneur owns the entire firm (ψ = 1),
while the lowest growth rate is 3%, when the entire firm is sold (ψ = 0). The parameters for µ(ψ)
are chosen to keep the agency costs of external equity modest so as to highlight the substitution
effect of external equity.
After external debt (with coupon b) and equity (with share 1 − ψ of the firm ownership) are
16

Initial equity issuance together with cashing out can be viewed as a two-step procedure to unload the entrepreneur’s private holdings. Gradual sales of ownership, e.g., as DeMarzo and Urosevic (2006) consider for large
shareholders, is less applicable for private business owners due to the lack of liquidity, which we capture with the
fixed cost K.

25

issued at t = 0, the entrepreneur’s optimal policies, including consumption/portfolio rule and
default/cash-out policies, are summarized in the following theorem.
Theorem 2 The entrepreneur exits from his business when the revenue process {yt : t ≥ 0} reaches
either the default threshold yd or the cash-out threshold yu , whichever occurs first. When the
entrepreneur runs his firm, he chooses his consumption and portfolio rules as follows:

is given in (C.6), and the value of external equity E0 = E(y0 ) is given by (C.10).
Equation (18) shows how the partial ownership ψ affects the entrepreneur’s private value of
equity. A more concentrated inside equity position (higher ψ) raises the last nonlinear term, which
raises the idiosyncratic risk premium that the entrepreneur demands. The ownership ψ also affects
the boundary conditions at cash-out. The value-matching condition (19c) at the cash-out boundary
states that, upon cashing out, the entrepreneur’s ownership is worth fraction ψ of the after-tax value
of the public firm value net of (1) the amount required to retire outstanding debt at par F0 , (2)
fixed costs K, and (3) capital gains taxes. The smooth-pasting condition (19d) also reflects the
effects of partial ownership.
Finally, at time t = 0, the entrepreneur chooses debt coupon b and initial ownership ψ to
maximize the private value of the firm S(y), which now has three parts: inside equity (entrepreneur’s
ownership), diversified outside equity, and outside debt:
S(y) = ψG(y) + (1 − ψ)E0 (y) + F (y).

The results are reported in Table 4. If the entrepreneur is risk-neutral, he will clearly prefer to
keep 100% ownership. In this case, all the equity in the firm is privately held, the private leverage is
33.6%, and the 10-year probabilities of default and cash-out are both close to zero. An entrepreneur
with γ = 1 lowers his ownership to 69%, which reduces the growth rate to 4.8% (only a 0.2% drop).
However, the coupon rises from 0.55 to 0.66, and private leverage rises from 33.6% to 48.8%. The
increase in demand for debt due to diversification is economically sizeable, especially considering
that the increase is partially offset by the reduced tax benefit of debt due to lower expected growth
rates. The 10-year default and cash-out probabilities rise to 3.8% and 11.3% respectively. When
γ = 2, the ownership drops to 65%, while private leverage rises further to 51.2%. The 10-year
cash-out probability also rises to 15.4%.
These results demonstrate that entrepreneurial firms have sizeable demand for risky debt and
cash-out options for diversification purpose, even when the agency costs of external equity are
small.

Concluding remarks

Entrepreneurial investment opportunities are often illiquid and non-tradable. Entrepreneurs cannot
completely diversify away project-specific risks for reasons such as incentives and informational
asymmetry. Therefore, the standard law-of-one-price-based valuation/capital structure paradigm
in corporate finance cannot be directly applied to entrepreneurial finance. An entrepreneur acts

27

both as a producer making dynamic investment, financing, and exit decisions for his business
project, and as a household making consumption/saving and portfolio decisions. The dual roles of
the entrepreneur motivate us to develop a dynamic incomplete-markets model of entrepreneurial
finance that centers around the non-diversification feature of the entrepreneurial business.
We show that more risk-averse entrepreneurs use higher leverage for greater diversification benefits and default earlier. This prediction holds not only in the baseline setting where the source
of external financing is risky debt, but is robust when we introduce additional channels of diversification such as cash-out option and external equity. In addition to compensation for systematic
risks, the entrepreneur also demands sizable premium for bearing idiosyncratic risks, which increase
with his risk aversion, his equilibrium inside ownership, and the project’s idiosyncratic variance.
Ignoring this idiosyncratic risk premium can lead to a large upward bias when computing the private value of entrepreneurial equity. Finally, even for low to moderate levels of risk aversion, the
idiosyncratic risk premium significantly weakens the risk shifting incentives (Jensen and Meckling
(1976)) for non-diversified managers.
Our paper also makes methodological contributions to financial valuation and decision making.
This paper extends the standard complete-markets Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing and real
options methodology to settings where investment opportunities are illiquid and not marked-tomarket, and decision makers are not diversified. Our framework can also be used to value the stock
options of non-diversified executives or to analyze how these executives make capital structure and
investment decisions. See Carpenter, Stanton, and Wallace (2008) for a recent study on the optimal
exercise policy for an executive stock option and implications for firm costs.
We have taken a standard optimization framework where the entrepreneur’s utility only depends
on his consumption. A significant fraction of entrepreneurs view the non-pecuniary benefits of
being their own bosses as a large component of rewards. It has also been documented that less
risk-averse (see Gentry and Hubbard (2004), De Nardi, Doctor, and Krane (2007)) and more
confident/optimistic individuals are more likely to self-select into entrepreneurship. We also do
not model the fundamental frictions causing markets to be incomplete and entrepreneurs to be
non-diversified. We view endogenous incomplete markets as a complementary perspective, which
can have fundamental implications such as promotion of entrepreneurship and contract design. We
leave these extensions for future research.

Appendix
A

Market valuation and capital structure of a public firm

Well-diversified owners of a public firm face complete markets. Given the Sharpe ratio η of the
market portfolio and the riskfree rate r, there exists a unique stochastic discount factor (SDF)
(ξt : t ≥ 0) satisfying (see Duffie (2001)):
dξt = −rξt dt − ηξt dBt ,

ξ0 = 1.

(A.1)

Using this SDF, we can derive the market value of the unlevered firm, A (y) , the market value of
equity, E (y) , and the market value of debt D (y) . The market value of the firm is equal to the
sum of equity value and debt value:
V (y) = E (y) + D (y) .

(A.2)

Under the risk-neutral probability measure Q, we can rewrite the dynamics of the revenue (1)
as follows:
dyt = νyt dt + ωyt dBtQ + ǫyt dZt ,

(A.3)

where ν is the risk-adjusted drift defined by ν ≡ µ − ωη, and BtQ is a standard Brownian motion
under Q satisfying dBtQ = dBt + ηdt.

A.1

Valuation of an unlevered public firm

Throughout the appendix, we derive our results assuming that there is a flow operating cost w for
running the project. The operating cost w generates operating leverage and hence the option to
abandon the firm has positive value. The results reported in this paper are for the case w = 0.
Appendix D.2 provides results for the case w > 0.
We start with the after-tax unlevered firm value A (y), which satisfies the following differential
equation:
1
rA (y) = (1 − τm ) (y − w) + νyA′ (y) + σ 2 y 2 A′′ (y) .
2

(A.4)

This is a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE). We need two boundary conditions to
obtain a solution. One boundary condition describes the behavior of A (y) when y → ∞. This
condition rules out speculative bubbles. To ensure that A (y) is finite, we assume r > ν throughout
the paper. The other boundary condition is related to abandonment. As in the standard option
29

exercise models, the firm is abandoned whenever the cash flow process hits a threshold value ya for
the first time. At the threshold ya , the following value-matching condition is satisfied
A (ya ) = 0,

(A.5)

because we normalize the outside value to zero. For the abandonment threshold ya to be optimal,
the following smooth-pasting condition must also be satisfied:
A′ (ya ) = 0.

(A.6)

Solving equation (A.4) and using the no-bubble condition and boundary conditions (A.5)-(A.6), we
obtain
A (y) = (1 − τm )

Valuation of a levered public firm

First, consider the market value of equity. Let yd be the corresponding default threshold. After
default, equity is worthless, in that E(y) = 0 for y ≤ yd . This gives us the value matching condition
E (yd ) = 0. Before default, equity value E (y) satisfies the following differential equation:
1
rE (y) = (1 − τm ) (y − w − b) + νyE ′ (y) + σ 2 y 2 E ′′ (y) , y ≥ yd .
2

(A.10)

When y → ∞, E (y) also satisfies a no-bubble condition. Solving this ODE and using the boundary
conditions, we obtain
E (y; yd ) = (1 − τm )

Equation (A.11) shows that equity value is equal to the after-tax present value of profit flows
minus the present value of the perpetual coupon payments plus an option value to default. The
term (y/yd )θ1 may be interpreted as the price of an Arrow-Debreu security contingent on the event
of default. The optimal default threshold satisfies the smooth-pasting condition,

(A.13)

After debt is in place, there is a conflict between equityholders and debtholders. Equityholders
choose the default threshold yd to maximize equity value E(y; yd ).
The market value of debt before default satisfies the following differential equation:
1
rD (y) = b + νyD ′ (y) + σ 2 y 2 D′′ (y) , y ≥ yd .
2

(A.14)

The value-matching condition is given by:
D (yd ) = αA (yd ) .

While yd∗ is chosen to maximize E(y), coupon b is chosen to maximize ex ante firm value V (y).
Substituting (A.13) into (A.17) and using the following first-order condition:
∂V (y0 )
= 0,
∂b

(A.18)

we obtain the optimal coupon rate b∗ as a function of y0 . We also verify that the second order

Proof of Theorem 1 and 2

Theorem 1 is a special case of Theorem 2. Thus, we only prove the results in the general case where
the entrepreneur has partial ownership ψ of the firm.
After exit (via default or cashing out), the entrepreneur solves the standard complete-markets
consumption/portfolio choice problem (Merton (1971)). His wealth follows
dxt = (r (xt − φt ) − ct ) dt + φt (µp dt + σp dBt ) .

Before exit, the entrepreneur’s financial wealth evolves as follows:

0 < t < min (Td , Tu ) .
(B.5)

17
An undesirable feature of CARA-utility models is that consumption and wealth could potentially turn negative.
Cox and Huang (1989) provide analytical formulae for consumption under complete markets for CARA utility with
non-negativity constraints. In our incomplete-markets setting, imposing non-negativity constraints substantially
complicates the analysis. Intuitively, requiring consumption to be positive increases the entrepreneur’s demand for
precautionary saving because he will increase his saving today to avoid hitting the constraints in the future. The
induced stronger precautionary saving demand will likely strengthen our results (such as diversification benefits of
outside risky debt).

32

Using the principle of optimality, we claim that the entrepreneur’s value function J s (x, y)
satisfies the following HJB equation:
δJ s (x, y) = max u(c) + (rx + φ (µp − r) − c + ψ (1 − τe ) (y − b − w)) Jxs (x, y)

(B.9)

As shown in Miao and Wang (2007), G(y) is the entrepreneur’s certainty equivalent wealth per
unit of the entrepreneur’s inside equity of the firm. Under this conjectured value function, it is
easy to show that the optimal consumption rule and the portfolio rule are given by (16) and (17),
respectively. Substituting these expressions back into the HJB equation (B.6) gives the differential
equation (18) for G (y).
We now turn to the boundary conditions. First, consider the lower default boundary. Since equity is worthless at default, the entrepreneur’s financial wealth x does not change immediately after
default. In addition, the entrepreneur’s value function should remain unchanged at the moment of
default. That is, the following value-matching condition holds at the default boundary yd (x):
J s (x, yd (x)) = J e (x).

(B.10)

In general, the default boundary depends on the entrepreneur’s wealth level. Because the
default boundary is optimally chosen, the following smooth-pasting conditions at y = yd (x) must
be satisfied:18
∂J s (x, y)

See Krylov (1980), Dumas (1991), and Dixit and Pindyck (1994) for details on the smooth-pasting conditions.

33

These two conditions equate the marginal value of wealth and the marginal value of revenue before
and after default.
At the instant of cashing out, the entrepreneur retires debt at par, pays fixed cost K, and sells
his firm for V ∗ (y) given in (A.17). We assume that the shares owned by existing equity-holders are
converted 1 : 1 into the shares of the new firm. Then the entrepreneur pays capital gains taxes on
the sale. His wealth xTu immediately after cashing out satisfies
xTu = xTu − + ψV ∗ (yTu ) − F0 − K − τg (ψV ∗ (yTu ) − K − (I − (1 − ψ)E0 )) .

(B.13)

The entrepreneur’s value function at the payout boundary yu (x) satisfies the following valuematching condition:
J s (x, yu (x)) = J e (x + ψV ∗ (yu (x)) − F0 − K − τg (ψV ∗ (yu (x)) − K − (I − (1 − ψ)E0 ))). (B.14)
The entrepreneur’s optimality implies the following smooth-pasting conditions at y = yu (x):

(B.15)
(B.16)

Using the conjectured value function (B.9), we show that the default and cash-out boundaries
yd (x) and yu (x) are independent of wealth. We thus simply use yd and yu to denote the default and
cash-out thresholds, respectively. Using the value matching and smooth-pasting conditions (B.10)(B.12) at yd , we obtain (19a) and (19b). Similarly, using the value-matching and smooth-pasting
conditions (B.14)-(B.16) at yu , we have (19c) and (19d).
Finally, we characterize the entrepreneur’s investment and financing decision at t = 0. Let x
denote the entrepreneur’s endowment of financial wealth. If the entrepreneur chooses to start his
business, his time-0 financial wealth x0 immediately after financing is
x0 = x − (I − F0 − (1 − ψ)E0 ).

(B.17)

At time zero, the entrepreneur chooses a coupon rate b and equity share ψ to solve the following
problem:

subject to the requirement that outside debt and equity are competitively priced, i.e., F0 = F (y0 ),
and E0 = E0 (y0 ). In Appendix C, we provide an explicit formulae for F (y) and E0 (y).
The entrepreneur will decide to launch the project if his value function from the project (under
the optimal capital structure) is higher than the value function without the project,
max J s (x + F0 + (1 − ψ)E0 − I, y0 ) > J e (x) .

Market values of the entrepreneurial firm’s outside debt and

the following ODE:

At the default trigger yd , debt recovers the fraction α of after-tax unlevered firm value, in that
F (yd ) = αA (yd ) . At the cash-out trigger yu , debt is retired and recovers its face value, in that

Equation (C.2) admits an intuitive interpretation. It states that debt value is equal to the present
value of coupon payments plus the changes in value when default occurs and when cash-out occurs.
Note that q(y0 ) can be interpreted as the present value of a dollar if cash-out occurs before default,
and q(y0 ) can be interpreted as the present value of a dollar if the entrepreneur goes bankrupt
before cash-out. Using F0 = F (y0 ), we have that the initial debt issuance is given by

Capital gain taxes and operating leverage

First, we analyze the case where the capital gains tax is zero. Then, we extend the baseline model
of Section II to allow for operating leverage.

D.1

Effects of capital gain taxes

In the presence of capital gains taxes with τg = 0.10, the benefit from cash-out falls. Table 5
shows that the 10-year cash-out probability decreases, and the entrepreneur takes on more debt in
order to diversify idiosyncratic risks. However, the quantitative effects are small in our numerical
example. We may understand the intuition from the value-matching condition (9c). At the cashout threshold yu , when ψ = 1, the entrepreneur obtains less value (1 − τg ) V ∗ (yu ), but enjoys tax
rebate τg (K + I). Thus, these two effects partially offset each other, making the effect of capital
gains taxes small. Clearly, if the cash-out value is sufficiently large relative to the cash-out and
investment costs, then the effect of the capital gains tax should be large.

D.2

Effects of operating leverage

How does operating leverage affect an entrepreneurial firm’s financial leverage? Intuitively, operating leverage increases financial distress risk, and thus should limit debt financing. Panel 3 of Table
6 confirms this intuition for the complete-markets case (the limiting case with γ → 0). As the

This table reports the results for the setting where the entrepreneur has both default and cash-out
options to exit from his project. The parameters are: r = δ = 0.03, η = 0.4, µ = 0.04, ω = 0.1,
ε = 0.2, α = 0.6, I = 10, and K = 27. The initial revenue is y0 = 1. We report results for two
business income tax rates (τe = 0, τm (11.29%)), two capital gain tax rates (τg = 0, 10%), and two
levels of risk aversion (γ = 1, 2). The case “γ → 0” corresponds to the complete-market model,
where the “cash-out” option effectively allows the firm to adjust leverage once.

operating cost w increases from 0.2 to 0.4, the 10-year default probability rises from 2.2% to 6.2%,
and the firm issues less debt. On the other hand, equity value also decreases because operating
costs lower the operating profits. As a result, the effect on financial leverage ratio is ambiguous. In
our numerical examples, this ratio increases with operating costs.
Our analysis above shows that risky debt has important diversification benefits for entrepreneurial
firms. This effect may dominate the preceding “crowding-out” effect of operating leverage. Table
6 confirms this intuition. As w increases from 0.2 to 0.4, an entrepreneur with γ = 1 raises debt
with increased coupon payments from 0.59 to 0.62. However, the market value of debt decreases
because both the 10-year default probability and the cash-out probability increase with w. The
private equity value also decreases with w and this effect dominates the decrease in debt. Thus, the
private leverage ratio rises with operating costs. This result also holds true for a more risk-averse
entrepreneur with γ = 2. Note that the more risk-averse entrepreneur relies more on risky debt to
diversify risk. As a result, the 10-year default probability increases substantially from 26.9% to
50.6% for γ = 2. But the 10-year cash-out probability decreases from 23.7% to 22.3%.
