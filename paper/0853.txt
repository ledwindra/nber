Behavior of Money, Credit and Prices in a Real Business Cycle

The

ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes the interaction of money and the price level

with a business cycle that is fully real in origin, adopting a view
which differs sharply from traditional theories that assign a significant

causal influence to monetary movements. The theoretical analysis

focuses on a banking system that produces transaction. services on demand

and thus reflects market activity. Under one regime of baiik regulation
and

fiat

money supply by the monetary authority, the real business cycle

predicts that (i) movements in external monetary measures should
be uncorrelated with real activity and (ii) movements in internal monetheory

tary measures should be positively correlated with real activity. Preliminary empirical analysis

provides general support for this focus on

the banking sector since much of the correlation between monetary
measures and real activity is apparently with inside money.

INTRODUCTION

-

The correlation between variations in the quantity of money and
fluctuations in real activity is perhaps the most discussed and least

easily explained element of macroeconomics. Traditional monetary theo-

ries of business fluctuations stress market failure as the key to under
standing this relationship, interpreting monetary movements as a primary

source of impulses to real activity
This paper describes an initial attempt to account for the relation—
ship between money and business cycles in terms that most economists would

label reverse causation. The basic idea is that the real sector drives the
monetary sector, in contrast to the traditional view of monetary movements

as business cycle impulses. In our model, variations in the real opportunities of the private economy--which include shifts in government
policies such as government purchases and tax rates, as well as technical
and environmental conlitions---are assumed to cause variations in both meas-

ures of real activity and monetary quantities The formal theoretical
framework involves two key elements:

prices and quantities
knowledge of the current
of

(i) market clearing determination

and (ii) rational expectations based on accurate

values of all pertinent state variables. Real

business cycles emerge in this setup as a result of the optimal plans of
private agents who are confronted by variations in real opportunities.

-2--

Since the idea that certain monetary quantities are endogenous is

an old one, it is useful to outline two recurrent themes. First, viewing
monetary services as a privately produced good, changes in internal money
can be systematically related to economic activity through the operation

of an unregulated banking sector.' Second, in a setting that contains a
mix of external (fiat) money and internal money, changes in external
money can be related to either economic activity or to the forces that

drive economic activity through central bank policy response. For example,
Tobin (1970) provides an earlier analysis of a model with endogenous money

that emphasizes central bank policy response. Tobints deterministic treatment involves the Keynesian idea that money and real activity respond to
the same causal influence--aggregate demand.2
Our analysis, on the other hand, employs a stochastic neo-classical

growth model in which movements in money and real activity respond

to variations in real opportunities. The analysis focuses on the banking
system and draws heavily on another analysis of Tobin (1963) and the
important recent contribution by Fama (1980a).

In the absence of central

bank policy response, the model predicts that movements in external money

measures should be uncorrelated with real activity. Some preliminary
empirical analysis (using annual data for the 1953-1978 period) provides
general support for our emphasis on private banks since the correlation
between monetary measures and real activity is primarily with inside
money.

-3-

Our motivation for pursuing this line of research is to produce an
equilibrium model that is capable of explaining the joint time series
behavior of real quantity variables, relative prices, the price level,

and alternative monetary measures. It is a common observation, however,
that such models must include a causal role for money [e.g., Lucas (l977)J.

Yet, economic theory has yet to provide a convincing rationale for such

a "nonneutrality" of money. Traditional explanations focus on central,
but implausible, market failures: Keynesian models most obviously so and
recent equilibrium theories in terms of the use of information, particu-

larly contemporaneous monetary information [(see King l98l)]. Consequently,
it

seems worthwhile to consider alternative hypotheses concerning money and

business cycles.
The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section II we
describe a simple model that is capable of generating real business cycles.

This model is used to discuss correlations between an "internal" monetary

quantity and real activity. In Section III, with fiat money grafted
onto the model, we analyze the relationship between monetary quantities,

output, and the price level in an unregulated banking environment. The
analysis also deals with a regulated banking system where it becomes

crucial to spell out the form of central bank policy. In Section
IV

we discuss some

of

the empirical implications of the theory

and provide a preliminary analysis of the post-war U.S. experience.

II. THE REAL ECONOMY

In this section a simple model economy is described that embodies the

potential for real business cycles. At this stage of research, government
is taken to exert no influence on the economy through tax policy or pur—

chases of final product. Rather, the model economy is driven solely by
shocks to current production opportunities that are assumed to have a

technological interpretation. Basically, the model is a stochastic growth
model with a single final product. Stochastic growth models of a more
general variety have recently been employed to study business cycles by

Long and Plosser (1980). Since such models incorporate many final products
and a more general pattern of production inter-relationships, richer

patterns of variation in economic activity can be generated. However,
the main aspects of the interactions of money, credit, and prices with
a real business cycle can be outlined in the present, simpler framework.
A.

The Final Goods Industry
There is a single final product that can serve as either a consumption

good (x) or a capital good (k). This final product is produced by a constant
returns to scale production process that uses labor (n), capital (k), and

transaction services (d) as inputs. The output generated from given inputs is assumed to be uncertain due to stochastic technical factors.
The production technology is given by

a unit of time corresponds to the production period for the single final
product.

Transaction services in (1) are viewed as an intermediate good
purchased by the final good producers from the financial industry (to

be described below). Although not involved directly in the production
of output in the same sense as labor and capital, transaction services
are taken to be a factor necessary to the firm's operation similar to

other organizational and control inputs. The final good industry and
financial industry could be vertically integrated so that transaction

services are provided by the firm internally. We believe, however,
that it is more fruitful to view firms specializing either in the
production of the final good or in the production of the transaction

services.

The production process described by (1) is subject to two random

The roles played by these two

shocks are quite different as will become clear in the discussions

that follow. At this point it is sufficient to recognize that

to be under the supervision of N identical com-

petitive firms. Firms operate by selling claims against the future product
obtained by combining units of capital, labor, and transaction services
that are rented at their respective rental prices,

Each

Thus, the

economy has the counterparts of trade credit, or circulating capital
(shares), and physical capital that play key roles in many macroeconomic

theories [as described, for example, by Haberler (1963)].

Asset Returns

Within the model economy there are two basic ways for agents to
hold wealth--as claims to the ownership of the goods in process at the
firm (circulating capital) and as physical capital.

An alternative store of value is capital. The owner of a unit of

return is certain in commodity terms because depreciation is not

random and rental prices are paid in period t.
It is useful in the analysis that follows to view agents as having the

opportunity to borrow or lend at a (real) riskless market interest rate, r.
Since these bonds are internal in character, in an economy of identical
individuals, the representative agent will not execute any such trans-

action. Nevertheless, the rate at which he/she would do so is well
defined and the rental rate on capital is fixed by the requirement

that the returns to these two assets be equalized. This follows from
the fact noted above that capital owners bear no risk. Thus, in
order for no arbitrage opportunities to exist, it must be the case
that

(l_)/(l-'-r).

The claims to production, on the other hand, are uncertain due to

Thus, the yields on these claims, r, and the return to the real
bond need not be equalized. In the absence of production uncertainty

the "share price" v is simply 4/(l+r). More generally, however,
uncertainty leads agents to discount future income at a higher rate
resulting in a lower "share price."

C.

The Financial Industry
The financial industry provides accounting services that facilitate

the

exchange of goods. The accounting system of exchange [described by

Fama (l9SOa, pp. 42-43)] operates through bookkeeping entries that permit

indirect market transactions without necessarily requiring any physical
medium of exchange. The produced output of the financial industry is

-9-

transactions services and is an intermediate good. The production of
transaction services is assujied to be instantaneous with a nonstochastic

constant returns to scale production function,

d = h(ndt,kd)

(2)

where, dt and kdt are the amounts of labor and capital services allocated
to the financial industry.8 A key element of this production structure is
that the production of the intermediate good requires a neglibible amount
of time relative to the production of the consumption/capital good. In

addition, the constant returns to scale structure implies that at given
factor prices,

w and

the financial industry has a supply curve that

is horizontal at p.
t

So far we have described the real productive activities of
the financial industry--flows of services generated from factors of
production--in a manner that could describe any intermediate product.
The transaction (banking) industry, however, usually provides these
services in conjunction with portfolio management or intermediary
services. That is, the industry maintains claims on the probability
distribution of output ("loans") and issues other claims ("deposits").

At this stage of the analysis, however, households have no demand
for transactions services except indirectly through their demand for

the final product. Consequently, the scope for the portfolio manage-

ment role of banks is limited. More specifically, since households do
not hold "deposits," transfers of "funds" from firms to individuals in

—10-

payment for labor and capital services cannot be conducted through book-

keeping entries alone. Thus, some form of wealth must "change hands"
and we suppose that it is desirable that some "assets" actually be held

in the financial industry to facilitate these transfers. For example,
one can view firms as selling shares to individuals and depositing the
"proceeds" with the financial industry which then provides the accounting
and transaction services necessary in disbursing the factor payments to

households during the period. We further assume that the size of the
"deposit" can be represented as Ydt. indicating that it is proportional
to the flow of transaction services.9
The activities of the financial industry described above are quite

limited. In Section III, the role of the financial industry is expanded
by assuming households have an independent desire for transactions services.
In that environment, the financial industry becomes more easily identified

with a banking system. Nevertheless, the present setup is sufficiently
developed to highlight the relationship between real output fluctuations
and deposits in an economy that possesses no fiat money.

Consider, for example, the case of an autonomous movement in

that

raises demand for all factors of production including transactions services
and thus deposits.

(We assume that the increase is not reversed in equili-

brium by increases in the wage and rental rates.) A general strategy for
simplifying the structure of the model that is consistent with the above story is to define the effective production function for the final goods producer

—11—

as f*(kt,nt), where

and

are the total quantities of capital and

labor used to produce final output (both directly and indirectly through

transactions services). The comparable "reduced form" production ex-

pression for deposits is h*(nt,kt). In the analysis below, the co-movement
of deposits with output emerges as a result of underlying movements in
total amounts of capital and labor inputs.

D.

Equilibrium Prices and Quantities

To complete the specification of the model it is necessary to specify
the preferences of a representative agent and to discuss the nature of the
constraints that the economy places on his/her behavior.

The representative individual is assumed to be infinite lived and
possess the lifetime utility function,

One analytical mechanism for generating equilibrium quantities and

prices [see, for example, Lucas (1978) and Long and Plosser (1980)] is

the study of the planning problem for the representative agent. This
strategy exploits the optimality of a competitive equilibrium in environments such as the present setup to calculate equilibrium quantities.
Furthermore, at optimal planned quantities, subjective and technical rates
of substitution correspond to competitive exchange rates.

From the point of view of the representative agent, the state of
the economy at date t is summarized by the values of two random variables,

Equation (5) also assumes

which emphasize two distinct features of individual behavior. The first
term on the right-hand side of these expressions measures variations in
the expected rewards to capital formation and work, respectively. The

second term involves the effects of production uncertainty on the household's assessment of the marginal value product of capital formation

and work, in the discussion that follows the latter pattern of effects
is de-emphasized by simply dropping the final term. This simplification
implies that the share price, v, equals t/(l+rt) and amounts to omitting

possibly interesting cyclical Variation in "risk premia." In focusing
on expected returns, however, the discussion is within the spirit of
much macroeconomic analysis.

The economic reasoning underlying these conditions is as follows. First,
an increase in the amount of the initial stock, s, involves additional
wealth so that the consumption of final product and leisure are expected

to rise. Agents, however, choose to spread some portion of this wealth

Inside Money, Credit, and the Real Business Cycle

In the real business cycle described above, a positive correlation
(co-movement) of real production, credit, and "inside money" (created by

the financial services industry) arises from the general equilibrium of

production and consumption decisions by firms and households. The timing
patterns among these variables, however, depends on the source of the
variation in real output.
1.

Unexpected Output Events ()

Real events of this form operate by altering the initial conditions, s,
pertinent for economic agents' plans for consumption, investment, and hours

of work. As discussed above, the implications of an unexpected wealth

increment ( > 1) for capital is straightforward: the economy responds
with higher net investment than would otherwise have been the case.

The implications for units of labor services are less clear, reflecting
the offsetting impact of higher national wealth and a higher marginal

product. Under the assumption that the wage effect dominates, real output rises and exhibits positive serial correlation. During the course

-16-

of such an economic expansion the volume of credit is also high as

firms finance relatively large amounts of goods in process. Real rates
of return move in a countercyclical direction, as agents' opportunities
to spread wealth over time are subject to diminishing returns (since
total time is in fixed supply).

The movement in final goods production induces a higher volume
of financial services and an accompanying increase in real bank deposits
due to the role of financial services as an intermediate factor in prow

duction. Hence, the volume of "inside money" quantities are positively
correlated with output with a rough coincidence in timing.

At least some business cycle episodes, however, are commonly viewed
by outside observers as involving a substantially different timing pattern.
In particular, traditional business cycle analysts [Burns and Mitchell
(1946)]; modern time series macroeconometricians [Sims (1972, 1980)];12

and monetary historians [Friedman and Schwartz (1963)] view monetary
variables as "leading" measures of real activity, with various forms of
13

timing concepts employed.
2.

Expected Output Events ()
One way of generating a substantially different timing pattern is

through shifts in the interteniporal opportunities of the economy as a

whole. Real events of this form, represented by

alter agents'

allocations of leisure and consumption between the present and the future

for a given level of national wealth. A positive shock (4 >

1),

under

the assumptions outlined above, expands hours worked with little accom-

panying change in consumption or capital. The fact that financial services
are an intermediate product- -which can be produced more rapidly than the
final product-- leads to an expansion of the quantity of such services and of

—17--

bank deposits. Consequently, movements in hours worked, interest rates
and security prices, deposits/financial services, and trade credit all

occur prior to the expansion of output. The subsequent increment to
time t+l wealth (stemming from the joint impact of the exogenous shift,
and agents' responses to that shift) works much like the above
discussion of unexpected output events.

—18-

III. CURRENCY, DEPOSITS, AND PRICES
In order to investigate the relationship between nominal aggregates
and the real business cycle, it is necessary to augment the hypothetical

economy developed above. In this section, a non-interest bearing government-supplied fiat currency (dollars, in a chauvinistic gesture) is
introduced and the factors affecting its value are analyzed.
First, in order for currency to be a well-defined economic good,
and thus, to have a determinate price in terms of a unit

of

output (l/P),

there must be a demand function for currency that reflects the economic

value assigned to the services of currency by economic agents. It would
be desirable to build in basic aspects of the economic environment that
give rise to a commodity money and then to examine the potential for

a non-backed governmental issue to haie positive value. This route,
however, is not attempted in the present paper. Instead, we assume that
households have a demand for transaction services. These services are
produced by combining units of currency purchasing power with the deposit

services of the banking industry. The production technology is

=

(6)

where

T(Ct,

d1)

is the flow of transactions services produced at time t,

is the stock of currency purchasing power, and dht

is

the quantity of

services purchased from the financial industry.

The demand for real transactions services is assumed to be a
positive function of the total market transactions that the household

-19-

engages jn,

as well as depending negatively on the cost of producing

these services. This demand for real transactions services and the production technology (6) imply a pair of derived demands for real currency

and services of the accounting system of exchange. These derived demands
are functions of the rental price of real currency, Rt/(l+Rt), arid the
effective cost of financial services, p. In forming these rental prices,

two important assumptions are made. First, there is a market for one
period nominal bonds that bear interest rate Rt. This nominal rate is
the sum of the real component, r, and an expected rate of inflation,
14

E().

Second, if banks are required to hold noninterest bearing reserves,

the returns earned by depositors may not match market rates. Given the
proportionate link between financial services (dr) and deposits (Yd),
the effective cost of a unit of deposit services, p, is influenced by

this reserve regulation. In the absence of reserve requirements

These assumptions about partial derivatives involve

some conventional assessments about the impacts of own and cross rental
price elasticities.

This formulation involves several ideas that are worth emphasizing.
First, the structure of the markets for currency and financial services

is analogous to that provided by Fama (1980a). In contrast to the discussion in Section II, the financial industry can now be viewed as

providing services that facilitate the exchange of goods through an

accounting system. As discussed previously, the accounting system
operates through bookkeeping entries without necessarily requiring

any physical medium of exchange. Following Fama (1980a), we assume that
it is desirable that some "assets" be held in the financial industry.
Thus, the financial industry holds claims (shares) on the probability
distribution of output and issues deposits.15 In the process of market
exchange, the claims that individuals and firms hold on the banks' portfolio (deposits) are altered, with the banking system recording these

transfers. Banks pass on to depositors the return to the portfolio of
assets less a fee for services.

Second, the structure of the financial industry implies that the
direct cost of the bookkeeping services,

does not hinge on the

character of the assets in the bank's portfolio. As discussed by Fama
(1980a), it follows that there is no particular reason that deposits

-21-

would be a homogenous good in an unregulated financial

industry. Finally,

the idea that financial services and currency are substitutes, but not
perfect substitutes, is implicit in (7).

In particular, currency yields

a real service flow in that there are some transactions (either of

magni-

tude or character) that are more efficiently carried out using currency

than the accounting system of exchange.'6
Given the setup of the markets for currency and deposit services

rather

described

above, determinacy of the price level is insured if the

government fixes the nominal quantity of currency--direct or indirect
regulation of financial sector quantities and/or characteristics are
not necessary.

Nevertheless, regulations can be important

for two reasons. First, regulations produce a differentiated class of
suppliers of financial services (banks) whose deposits are sometimes des-

cribed as inside money. Second, regulations can have influences on the
price level by altering the effective rental price of financial services.
The analysis below focuses on the implications of alternative
banking structures for the behavior of currency, deposits, and prices.
For clarity, the bulk of the discussion is conducted under the assuniption that the treasury/central bank maintains a policy of controlling

the issue of nominal currency so that the stock of currency (C. =

Ptct)

is an exogenous random variable. Other models of central bank behavior
are discussed in Part B below.

A. Money and Prices--Unregulated Banking
In an unregulated banking environment we assume that the deposit industry

would hold virtually no currency. Consequently, the determination of the

—22-

price level involves the requirement that the real supply of currency (C/P)

be equal to the real demand for currency given by (7a) above. The equilibrium
price level is then

Pt =

(8)

C/2(.)

where 9(.) is the demand function for real currency. Using the arguments of
we can rewrite this condition as

Pt =

(9)

P(C,
+

-

R,
+

-

The signs of the respective derivatives in (9) are straightforward and
warrant little explanation.17
An
Thus,

important feature of (9)

as stressed

is that nominal demand deposits do not appear.

by Fama (l980a), there is no need for government control of

banking or the supply of deposits to insure a determinate price level. Banks,
in a competitive, unregulated environment, simply pass portfolio returns on
to their depositors less a fee charged for the provision of transactions
services, so that

=

Although the signs of the partial derivations in (9) are straightforward, it is important to stress that we have ruled out real effects

of sustained increases in the growth of currency.18 Such behavior leads
to sustained inflation and a rise in the nominal interest rate, R, which
implies a fall in the demand for real currency and a rise in real deposits.

-23-

Since an increase in real deposit services involves the use of real resources,

the economy is made worse off by sustained inflation. We assume, however,
that this increase in the size of the financial sector has no important

implications for the real general equilibrium. It is not obvious that

this is a good assumption from an empirical point of view. Nevertheless, it
does serve to bring into sharp focus the distinction between "inside"
and "outside" money, particularly with respect to the neutrality and
superneutrality of government currency issue.
B.

Money and Prices--Regulated Banking
In the unregulated environment the price level is determined in the

"currency market" and deposits play no essential role. There are a number
of bank regulations, however, that serve to distinguish banks from other

financial intermediaries. This section discusses the extent to which
these regulations alter the nature of price level determination. As it
turns out, the impact of regulations depends on (1) the interaction of
banking regulation with the external money supply policy of the central bank!
treasury and (ii) the extent to which government mandates can be offset by countervailing private substitutions.
1.

Portfolio Regulations and Reserve Requirements
It is useful to start by discussing a set of regulations that do

not have any important consequences for the price level. Suppose that
the government specifies the "risk composition" of the underlying assets
against which deposits are claims. As long as agents can offset this
restriction by rebalancing the contents of their portfolios (i.e., the
distribution of total wealth between the banking sector and other portfolio

-24-

managers), then this regulation will have no impact on any real variables
or the price level.'9

On the other hand, restrictions specifying that banks must hold some
fraction (0) of their nominal asset portfolio in the form of noninterest
bearing reserves issued by the central bank may have important effects.
For example, the central bank could specify that reserve accounts are
deposits of securities, with nominal interest accruing to the central

bank. This mechanism is one way of imposing a deposit tax with the consequence that the cost of deposit services would be

>

Such a

deposit tax results in a reduction in the size of the banking sector and

an increase in the real demand for currency.2° The impact of this reserve
requirement on price level determination depends on the central bank

policy. For example, if the treasury/central bank makes currency in the
hands of the public an exogenous quantity, unresponsive to developments

in

21

the banking sector,

.

then the price level continues to be determined

by the requirement that the real stock of currency outstanding (Ct/Pt) be
equal

2.

to the real demand.
Alternative Central Bank Policies

The currency market determines the price level if the central bank

is

assumed to make currency an exogenously controlled quantity. There

are, however, other control methods available to the central bank. For
example, if the central bank combines a reserve requirement with a policy
of controlling the sum of currency and nominal bank reserves (high powered
money), then the price level can be viewed as being determined in the
market for high powered money.

the partial derivatives are straightforward. Note,

in particular, that an increase in the demand for real reserves

(B/P)

holding high powered money fixed necessitates a fall in the price level.

There are a variety of mechanisms for accomplishing control of high

powered money by the central bank. One possibility is that the government
could require that banks hold dollar denominated, non-interesting bearing
reserve accounts and for the central bank to increase or decrease currency

in response to shifts in bank reserves.22 Under this scheme the central
bank could allow banks to freely exchange reserves for currency, but would
not allow banks to freely convert securities into reserves.

As discussed in Fama (1980a, pp. 52-53) there are other central bank

policies that could be used to make the price level determinate. In particular, the central bank could choose to make nominal bank reserves an

—26-

exogenous quantity and supply currency on demand. In this case (which

current

some argue are the

policies of the Federal Reserve), the price

level can be viewed as being determined in the market for reserves. The
equilibrium price level would be determined by the exogenous supply of
nominal reserves (Br) and the total real demand for deposit services.23

1) lead to a business cycle

where output is high and the real rate of return is low. Consequently,
a wealth increment leads to lower prices due to both lower real returns

(r, Er+1

)

and higher income

Etyt+l

In Section II we describe how a better than average opportunity

to transfer resources intertemporally ( > 1) leads to an increase in r.
In addition, the increase in wealth that is brought about by such a shift

leads to lower future returns (Er+1, Er+2

puts (Eyt+i, Ey+2

)

and higher future out-

).Thus, the overall impact on the price level is

ambiguous, involving the positive influence of the higher current real
return,

and the negative influence of the lower expected future returns

and higher expected future outputs.
The above two examples indicate that the model produces a price
level

that is likely to be countercyclical. For some macroecononiists,

the procyclical character of the general price level is such a well

established empirical regularity that this feature alone is sufficient

to reject real business cycle theory [e.g., Lucas (1977, p. 20)]. If
it is indeed necessary to generate procyclical price movements, then

there appear to be two principle channels. First, an alternative
structure that involves a more permanent, capital_augmenting form of
technological change could heighten the real return effects discussed

above. Combining this structure with a sufficiently interest sensitive

—28-

demand for money could lead to procyclical prices. Second, policy
response to real activity also could generate procyclical price move-

ments.25 For example, a positive response of outside money creation
to output could lead to a positive correlation between prices and output.

-29-

IV. EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS
The preceding sections describe a simple model economy with business

cycles that are completely real in origin. Nevertheless, correlations between
real activity and monetary measures arise from the operation of the banking

system and central bank policy responses. In this section, we discuss some
of the predictions that our model makes concerning the joint time series
behavior of output, monetary aggregates, rates of return, and the price

level. In addition, we discuss U. S. business cycle experience during the
post World War II period, providing some gross correlations that bear on
the potential relevance of our theoretical stories.

Before proceeding, it is useful to briefly consider general strategies
for investigating the empirical importance of 'real business cycle' theories
and to discuss how the present analysis of money and the price level could
be related to such investigations.
One empirical strategy is to attempt to isolate a group of ob-

servable real disturbances that provide an explanation of much of a
particular nation's business cycle experience, in the sense of delivering

a "good fit." Candidates for such real shocks include government purchase,
tax, and regulatory actions; changes in technological and environment conditions; and movements in relative prices that are determined in a world

market. In pursuing this line of research, the goal is to provide a
direct substitute for the high explanatory power of monetary variables

in other business cycles studies [e.g., Friedman and Schwartz (1963)
and Barro (1981a)]. The natural extension would be to study the explanatory

-30-

power of such real factors for monetary variables and the price level. In
our framework, many of these real variables would be restricted to influence
monetary quantities (particularly, inside money) through their influence on

output and a small set of relative prices. In this sense, aspects of the
present type of monetary theory do provide meaningful restrictions on
the data.

Another approach is to treat the fundamental real shocks as unobservable and to focus on the interactions between sectors that arise
during business cycles; a strategy that is the empirical analogue of the

theoretical analysis of Long and Plosser (1980). Since a particular real
business cycle theory restricts own and cross serial correlation properties
of industry output and relative prices, this route can provide valuable information about the regular aspects of business cycles even though the

sources of shocks are not identified. Again, the principal testable restrictions of theorizing along the above lines would arise from the
restricted fashion that variations in production in other sectors were
allowed to influence developments in the monetary sector.

Unfortunately, analysis of monetary phenomena using either of these
strategies is not feasible given the state of real business cycle models.

Consequently, the present empirical investigation is limited to providing
some admittedly crude correlations among the variables suggested by the
theory.

the period 19531978.26 We focus on the 1953-1978 interval primarily to
avoid the period when the Federal Reserve maintained a policy of pegging

the yields on ii. S. government securities. The implications of such a
policy may be very different from those described in the previous section
where the central bank controls some measure of money.

The most noticeable feature in Table I is the different behavior of

nominal and real variables. Typically, the growth rates of real variables
display much less serial correlation than the growth rates of nominal

variables. For example, the growth of real demand deposits is much less
autocorrelated than the growth rate of nominal demand deposits. Indeed,
as previously noted by Nelson and Plosser (1982) and other authors, many
real variables display random walk like behavior in logarithmic form.

The most notable exceptions to this random walk behavior are real currency

(C/P) and real service charges

both of which display significant

positive serial dependences.
B.

Real Factors and Aggregate Output

As an example of how real factors could serve as important impulses
to business fluctuations, Table II reports regressions of aggregate output
on two components of government purchases of goods and services (real
federal defense and nondefense components) and the relative price of energy.

Table II indicates that defense purchases exert a positive influence on
output (though statistically a weak one) and that nondefense purchases are

unimportant. These results are consistent with Barrots (198lb) longer period
evidence that temporary increases in government purchases have an expansionary

impact. Since our sample period involves only the Vietnam war, it is
perhaps not surprising that the t-statistic on defense purchases is low.

Table II also indicates a weak negative impact of the relative price of

energy. At present, we are seeking to augment these real factors with
other tax and expenditure measures. The main difficulty lies in constructing the average marginal tax rates that theory predicts would be
important in output determination.
Additional evidence on the importance of real disturbances in out-

put fluctuations is offered in Nelson and Plosser (1982). Using an
unobserved components model of output and the observed autocovariance
structure of real GNP, Nelson and Plosser conclude that real (non-monetary)

disturbances are the primary source of variance in real activity. This
result is based on the commonly held view that monetary disturbances should
have no permanent effects on real output and thus disturbances that are of
a permanent nature must be associated with real rather than monetary sources.
C.

Money-Output Correlations

The theoretical model stresses that internal real monetary balances
should be positively correlated with real activity, since money is a pro-

duced input. Further, the model predicts that autonomous external nominal
money creation/destruction is neutral with respect to output growth. These
two ideas suggest the value of analyzing money-output correlations in two

forms: real versus nominal balances and internal versus external monetary
measures.

Table III presents some information on the contemporaneous relationships
between output growth and growth rates of alternative monetary measures.

Equation (1) shows the strong, positive contemporaneous correlation that

exists between real demand deposits and economic activity. This strong
contemporaneous correlation is shared by real external balances measured
as currency or as high powered money (equations (2) and (3)). In nominal

balance form, equations (4), (5), and (6) show demand deposits are more
strongly correlated with real activity than either of the nominal external
money measures.

Further, (7) and (8) indicate that nominal high powered money and
currency growth have a positive partial correlation with output given real

demand deposits although the correlation is not as strong as that with
real deposits (either in terms of the magnitude of the coefficient or the
pertinent t-statistic).

From the standpoint of our theoretical discussion, the key aspects of

these contemporaneous correlations are as follows. First, the fact that
much of the correlation is with internal monetary measures is consistent
with our general view of the relationship between money and real activity.

Second, the fact that nominal money measures may be positively correlated
with real activity is at odds with our theory if the monetary authority
makes nominal monetary measures such as currency or high powered money
evolve in an autonomous manner.

To provide some further information on the relationship between output
growth and growth rates of alternative monies, Table IV reports some

analogous regression results that incorporate lags of the alternative
monetary measures.

Equation (1) in Table IV shows the results of adding two years of lagged

real deposits to the output regression. The F statistic pertinent for evaluating the marginal contribution of these lags is 2.48, which is well below
the 95% critical value of 3.49, so that there is no strong evidence that

these lags are important. Equations (2) and (3) show analogous results for
nominal money growth measures.
In order to investigate the extent to which nominal money growth is
correlated with real activity, after accounting for real deposit growth,

equations (4) and (5) must be examined. The contemporaneous and two lags
of high powered money and currency in the hands of the public are not
important explanatory variables (the 95% critical value for F(3, 17) is
3.20 and the F statistics for the lags of high powered money and currency
terms

are

1.22 and .40, respectively). However, the estimated coefficient

on current and lagged high powered money are opposite in sign and nearly
identical in magnitude, so that the change in high powered money growth appears
to be positively correlated with real activity (see equation (6)).

Overall, our interpretation is that the correlations reported in Tables
III and IV indicate that much of the relationship between money and fluctuations in real activity is apparently with inside money, which is comforting
given the key role that the banking system plays in our theoretical story.

Nevertheless, somewhat weaker correlations between real activity and nominal
outside money may exist, suggesting it probably is necessary to analyze
policy response in greater detail for 1953-1978 period.
D.

Money-Inflation Correlations
The theoretical model predicts that variations in external money, real

-35-

activity, the nominal interest rate and a measure of the cost of banking
services should be important in explaining movements in the price level.
Table V provides estimates of the price level equations (9) and (11) of
Section III under the assumption that a log-linear functional form is

appropriate. Although the nominal interest rate is endogenous and the
above discussion indicates that high powered money and/or currency may
also be endogenous due to policy response, ordinary least squares methods

are employed. Since there is a substantial empirical literature on
price level/money demand equations, our discussion focuses principally
on new aspects that are raised by the theoretical discussion above.
First, the theory suggests that a measure of external money, such as

currency a high powered money, is the relevant nominal aggregrate for price
level determination Farna (l980b) stresses this point]

.

Table V reports

results for both currency and high powered money.
Second, in the regulated banking environment described in Section III,
the relevant cost of deposit services (denoted

involves both the direct

cost of providing an accounting system of exchange (denoted

and the

interest that the bank/depositor must forego due to reserve requirements.
The empirical counterpart to the nominal unit cost of deposit services that

we have constructed is the ratio of total services charges on demand deposits
at Federal Reserve member banks to total check clearings by the Federal

Reserve. Deflating this measure by the price level leads to a measure of
real costs of deposit services, entered in Table V as p. However, during
some portions of the period under study, banks faced apparently binding
constraints on the level of interest payments that could be paid on demand

deposits. It is frequently argued that explicit service charges would be
reduced as a means of avoiding the interest rate constraint. As a result,
we are not completely comfortable with our interpretation of this variable.
Third, when reserve requirements are present and the central bank is
controlling the quantity of high powered money, the theory predicts that
the volume of real reserves should negatively influence the price level

given the stock of high powered money. On the other hand, when currency
is the controlled external quantity, real reserves should not be relevant.

In Panel A of Table V, equations (A4) and (A8) report the results of
estimating the price level (inverse money demand) equation over the sample
period 1953-1978, with currency as the measure of external money and employing real reserves and the service charge measure as explanatory variables.

The main features of these equations are broadly consistent with other

studies: a negative impact of real activity, positive impact of nominal
money growth, and minor impact of the short-term interest rate (4 to 6

month commercial paper rate), If currency is the appropriate measure of
external money the theory predicts a zero coefficient on real reserves.
In equation (A4) this coefficient is negative and marginally significant.
Imposition of the unit coefficient on currency reduces the significance

of this coefficient, The tendency of our service charge measure to switch
sign with the imposition of the unit constraint is troubling, although the
presence of that additional explanatory variable does not appear to
substantially influence other coefficient estimates.
In Panel B of Table V, equations (B4) and (B8) report analogous

results for high powered money as the measure of external money with general

-37-

features that are again broadly consistent with other studies. Under our
theory, real bank reserves should enter negatively in such price level
equations if high powered money is the controlled measure of external

money. This is borne out by significant negative coefficients in both
the unconstrained equation (B4) and

constrained

equation (B8). As pre-

viously, the service charge variable has a tendency to change sign when
the unit

constraint

is imposed.

Overall, the results of Table V are broadly consistent with the

theoretical stories told in the sections above. The negative influence
of real reserves on the price level potentially is important, both in
terms of explaining post-war price level behavior and, potentially, in
explaining the apparently anornolous behavior of the price level during

the interwar period. Finally, additional work needs to be done in producing measures of the market prices of bank services.

CONG LUS IONS

This paper describes an initial attempt to account for the relationship between money, inflation, and economic activity within the framework

of real business cycle theory. Although the empirical work presented
above is simplistic, we draw two main lessons from it. First, much of
the contemporaneous correlation of economic activity and money is apparently with inside money, with inflation principally resulting from changes

in the stock of fiat money and variations in real activity. Second,
future work along these lines may have to consider policy responses that
are broad enough to produce variations in outside money that are contemporaneously correlated with real activity.

A main component of our future work in this area will be to develop
the implications of the analysis for security returns, so that the general equilibrium predictions for these variables can be exploited in

tests of the model. This topic is especially important because Sims
(1980) and Fama (1981) have provided some hints about the interactions

of money, asset returns, and real activity. In addition, we
are in the process of casting the predictions

of theory within the class

of linear multivariate time series models so that broader patterns of
policy response can be examined and the results compared to other

studies. Thus, we feel there is a substantial amount of work to be
done.

In conclusion, it seems worthwhile to discuss two recurrent comments

on this line of research that we have received. First, there has been a

-39-

surprising willingness on the part of the many individuals to simultane-

ously argue that our model (a real business cycle model with an explicit
banking sector and central bank) is probably observationally equivalent
to existing theories and that a "common sense" view leads one to prefer

alternative models as descriptions of reality.27 This line of argument
puzzles us, since it was presumably on empirical grounds that the profession rejected pre-Keynesian "equilibrium theories" of the business
cycle that stressed real causes of economic fluctuations.
Second, some individuals have argued that market failure is

central to both the understanding of cyclical fluctuations and the primary

reason for economists to study these phenomena. Our view is that widespread market failure need not be a necessary component of a theory of
business fluctuations and we (at least) remain interested in real business
cycle theory as potentially an important contribution to positive economics.

This perspective, however, is not inconsistent with the view that the
accumulation of scientific knowledge may lead to the design of more
desirable governmental policies toward business fluctuations (such as
tax and expenditure policies) or toward the regulation of the financial
sector.

A related story involves the operation of a commodity money economy
where changes in the production of the commodity money are related
to economic activity through variations in the relative price of
the commodity money.

2.

Black (1972) also describes a model where both internal and external
money are endogenously determined.

3.

Not surprisingly, this single sentence dismissal of received doctrine
on the relationship between money and business cycles has provoked a

sharp reaction from a number of readers. Although a footnote is not
an appropriate vehicle for a survey of contemporary macro theory,

some additional comments are perhaps in order. Keynesian models
typically rely on implausible wage rigidities, from the textbook
reliance on exogenous values to recent, more sophisticated efforts
of Fischer (1977) and Phelps and Taylor (1977) that rely on existing

nominal contracts. As Barro (1977) points out, a key feature of the
Fischer-Phelps--Taylor model is that agents select contracts that do

not fully exploit potential gains from trade. In addition, Azariadis's
(1978) micro-based model of wage-employment contracts implies that

perceived monetary disturbances do not alter output.
Recent analyses of monetary nonneutrality that stress expectation
errors based on "imperfect information" [Lucas (1977) provides a summary
of this viewpoint] similarly rely on an apparent failure in the market

for information. For example, information on monetary statistics is
cheap and readily available. King (1981) demonstrates that in Lucas'
(1973) model, real output should be .mcorre1ated with contemporaneously

available monetary information. Boschen and Grossman (1982) empirically
investigate this proposition and find that it is rejected by the data.

Capital services are measured in commodity units allocated to production at time t, labor services are hours worked, and transaction
services can be viewed as the number of bookkeeping entries used
(described more fully below).

5.

An interesting and useful discussion of the role of money as a
factor of production can be found in Fischer (1974).

6.

The multiplicative nature of the randomness in total production
implies a technological neutrality of the shocks with respect to

individual factors of production. A more general specification
might allow different stochastic elements to be associated with

particular factors of production. Such a model could provide a
richer set of co-movements among various measures of economic
activity.

is, the requirement that production takes time means that the

rental price of capital involves the marginal product of capital,
which influences output next period, discounted at the rate a.

8.

We assume that transaction services are produced deterministically

for several reasons. The first reason is to keep the model as simple
as possible by limiting the number of independent sources of random

fluctuation. The second reason involves the assumption that stochastic variations in transaction services are "small" in that they
have little impact on the real equilibrium in the final good industry.

It may, however, prove interesting to allow stochastic variation
in the provision of financial services as an independent source

of shocks to the real system. One might then proceed to decompose
real fluctuations into those attributable to shocks to the final
goods industry and the financial industry.

9.

Assuming that transaction services and the stock of deposits are
related by a positive constant (any positive function is sufficient
for our purposes) implicity rules out firms (and in Section III,

individuals) using a given stock of deposits more or less intensively
(i.e., getting varying amounts of bookkeeping entries from a given

stock of deposits). We recognize that this is a strong assumption
(although it is commonly used in specifying production functions)
but it (over?) simplifies the analytical tractability of the model.

Sims (1980) discusses reverse causation of money and output work-

ing through central bank operating policies. The present setup
is a first step toward the type of small scale general equilibrium
model that is necessary to evaluate the reverse causation argument.

13.

We deliberately employ the idea of a "leading variable" in a loose

manner so as to capture the common elements of these alternative

discussions. Sargent (1979, pp. 247-248) discusses how the timing
concepts employed by business cycle forecasters and time series
econometricians differ, relating a particular formal definition
of a 'leading indicator" to "causality" in the sense of Granger,
Sims, and Weiner,

14. At this point we note that we are ignoring any "risk premium" due
to inflation risk in our definition of the nominal rate.

15. Deposits in an unregulated environment are obviously not riskless

assets and banks would preumab1y offer deposits (claims on an
underlying portfolio of assets) with varying levels of risk
depending on demand.

16.

It is also worth noting that consumers and producers are treated
asymmetrically in that the demand for real currency is only a
household demand and is not partly a derived demand by firms.
This reflects our view of the type of transactions that are
accomplished with cash and also a desire tQ keep the model
as simple as possible.

17. Although our model is similar in some respects o Black (1972),
our view of price level determination is quite different. In
Black's model, the price level is exogenous to the money supply

process. Equilibrium requires that the central bank supply fiat
currency on demand (passively) or else it loses economic value
as a medium of exchange.

18,

In other words, our model is "super neutral," in the language of

monetary growth theory. It is worthwhile pointing out that this
literature does not provide a clearcut guide to the nature of

departures from super neutrality. For example, Tobin (1965),
has argued that an increase in inflation will lower real rates
of return and raise capital formation, by lowering the real value

of money and, consequently, raising saving. By contrast, Stockman
(1982) argues that inflation acts as a tax on the saving process
(in which money is an input) and, hence, depresses capital formation.

19. This application of the Modigliani-Miller theorem requires us to
ignore transactions costs in a specific manner that is stronger
than usual. In particular, the cost of running the accounting
system of exchange must be the same across regulated and unregulated
systems.

20.

We are assuming that the reduction in the size of the deposit industry
has a negligible impact on the real general equilibrium of the model
(in particular, on the final goods production, which enters as a scale
variable in the demand for currency).

21. The central bank, therefore, "passively supplies" any quantity of
reserves required by the banking system.

22. Another possibility is to require banks to hold cash directly, For
the current discussion, however, it is not necessary to distinguish
between those operating schemes.

23. We have not analyzed the implications for price level determination
when the central bank attempts to control the interest rate. However,
this may be important for some periods in order to conduct an appropriate empirical investigation,

24. For simplicity, we ignore movements in the cost of deposit services
as an important factor affecting the price level,

25. Recent work using post-World War II data [e.g., Hodrick and Prescott,
(1980)] seems to suggest that the positive correlation between

output and price level movements may be not as robust as sometimes
thought.

Digest.

APPENDIX A
Market Behavior

The discussion in the text focuses almost entirely on the planning

problem and it may be worthwhile to discuss some aspects of economic

agents' market behavior in this hypothetical economy. The present
appendix dicussses the choice problems faced by households and firms
as well as the conditions of market equilibrium.

Household Optimization
The agent under study chooses current flows of consumption (xt)

and leisure (fin), as well as purchases/sales of real bonds (be), claims
to circulating capital (ar), and physical capital (kr) so as to maximize the

expected value of lifetime utility. The agent is assumed to view the
prices

,

v,

q and w as functions of aggregate state variables

but not of his/her owii actions and, further, to employ the objective

probability distributions of these aggregate random variables in
forming expectations.

capital) are as follows.

Viewing the first and fourth of these conditions, it follows that
the absence of arbitrage requires that

= 1 -

, as

real bonds

and physical capital are perfect substitutes as a store of value from

the household's viewpoint. This will be presumed to hold here and
below.

Rearranging the first and third expressions leads to the following
condition, which can be interpreted as equality between the cost of a
unit of "circulating capital" and the household's risk adjusted demand
price for these claims.

From an application of the envelope theorem, it follows that

so that H1 =

Hence, it follows that H11 < 0.

Using this fact, it is straightforward that E{H1(t+i -

so that a household requires a risk premium --

to

the sense of a lower share price and a higher expected return --

hold any specified positive quantity of circulating capital. In the
absence of uncertainty about future returns (e.g.,

has a degenerate

distribution at its mean of unity), however, it follows that

4t

v = l+r

i.e., the security price is simply the present value of the certain
future earnings.

The first two conditions simply involve efficient selection of an

intertemporal consumption—saving plan at interest rate r and a con—
temporaneous allocation between labor and leisure, i.e., a labor supply
decision.

Firm Optimization
Following the production example above, it simplifies matters to
"vertically integrate" the final product and financial industries so
that there is a single production decision being made, based on a production function of the firm,

=

tt+if*(nt,

kr).

The purely atemporal decisions of the firms in this model economy
then involve the following comparable efficiency conditions in the four
markets.

APPENDIX B
The Planning Problem
This appendix provides some additional details on the planner's
problems discussed in Section II of the text.
The "economic planner" faces the constraint that

+ (1_S)ki

in

terms of sources and uses of cur-

rent product. The recursive equation of the planner's problem has the
form

J(s, q) =

[u(s_kt n-np +

given that the constraint holds as an equality. The first order conditions to this problem are

ui(s_kti

These may be rewritten in a more useful form that emphasizes the
two distinct features of individual behavior.

ui(s_kt,

nt) =

The first component involves agent's optimal response to variations in

the expected response to capital formation and work. The second
involves the effects of production "uncertainty" on the household's
assessment of the marginal value product of capital formation and work.

The present analysis deemphasizes the latter pattern of effects by
simply dropping the final term (which corresponds to a degenerate dis—

tribution of tl at its mean of unity). Totally differentiating the
above expressions leads to the following:
