    "abstract": "\n\nSeveral econometric models for the analysis of relationships with limited dependent variables have been proposed, including the probit, Tobit, two-limit probit, ordered discrete, and friction models. Widespread application of these methods has been hampered by the lack of suitable computer programs. This paper provides a concise survey of the various models; suggests a general functional model under which they may be formulated and analyzed; reviews the analytic problems and the similarities and dissimilarities of the models; and outlines the appropriate and necessary methods of analysis including, but not limited to, estimation. It is thus intended to serve as a guide for users of the various models, for the preparation of suitable computer programs, for the users of those programs; and, more specifically, for the users of the program package utilizing the functional model as implemented on the NBER TROLL system.\n\n",
