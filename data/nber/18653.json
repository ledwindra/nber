    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper studies the e\ufb00ects of trade liberalization on capital \ufb02ows in a dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin model, and makes four contributions. First, we identify an interest rate over-determination problem in such a model, and solve it with an endogenous discount factor. Second, we show that a trade liberalization in a developing country generally leads to a greater current account surplus, which is the exact opposite of a common but partial equilibrium intuition. Third, factor market reforms reinforce the e\ufb00ect of the trade liberalization on capital out\ufb02ows. Finally, our calibrations suggest that China\u2019s accession to the WTO is likely an important factor driving the rise of its current account surplus.\n\n",
