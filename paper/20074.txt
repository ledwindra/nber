Market Structure, Reputation, and the Value of Quality Certification

ABSTRACT
Quality certification programs help consumers to identify high-quality products or sellers in markets
with information asymmetries. Using data from eBay UK’s online marketplace, we study how certification’s
impact on consumer demand varies with market- and seller-level attributes, exploiting quasi-experimental
variation in sellers’ certification status. The positive effects of eBay’s “top rated seller” certification
are stronger for categories with relatively few other certified sellers, in more competitive markets,
and for sellers with shorter records of past performance. These findings indicate certification provides
its greatest value when certification is rare, the product space is crowded, and for sellers lacking established
reputations.

1. Introduction
Quality certification as a means of reducing “lemons” problems is a common feature
across a range of markets, including consumer retail, firm-to-firm trade, labor markets,
and specialty services like medical treatment and auto repair. 1 The ubiquity of “expert”
guidance from certifiers like Consumer Reports, city hygiene departments, and various
hospital credentialing organizations, to name just a few, has spawned a large related
empirical literature (surveyed by Dranove and Jin 2010) that has provided many useful
insights on the efficacy and attributes of certification mechanisms.
Empirical studies in this area generally feature a close examination of how quality
certification affects trade in a single market, where the competitive environment and
information context is held fixed. This makes it difficult to answer a host of fundamental
questions, such as: How does the number of competing products on nearby store shelves
or webpages affect consumer responses to certification? How might certification’s value
differ between industries with a high scope for seller opportunism – as in automotive
services – versus those with little quality uncertainty – like the market for toasters? How
might certification’s quality threshold affect its impact on consumer choices? And how
do alternative reputational signals like crowd-sourced feedback affect the value of
certification? Developing a better understanding of the differential impact of certification
as a function of seller or industry attributes can help to assess how the introduction of
certification mechanisms is likely to affect industry evolution, including firm entry and
market power, and to anticipate what types of firms will gain and lose as a result.
Evaluating the heterogeneous effects of certification may also aid in the design of
certification programs themselves, providing guidance, for example, on the choice of
quality threshold requirements and how the program might be influenced by industry
attributes like the scope for opportunism.
To begin addressing these questions, we examine the impact of eBay’s Top-Rated
Seller (eTRS) certification using a dataset comprised of 1.6 million “quasi-experiments”
1

The literature has considered a wide variety of mechanisms for individual firms to signal quality and build
consumers’ trust, e.g. Milgrom and Roberts (1986), Grossman (1981), Klein and Leffler (1981). Third
parties can also act to monitor and rate firm’s quality and performance, e.g. Lizzeri (1999).

run by nearly 23,000 sellers in more than 8,000 distinct product categories in the United
Kingdom. These quasi-experiments feature variation in sellers’ certification status for
otherwise identical products offered for sale. Identical criteria are used to evaluate all
sellers for certification, independent of the category where they place their listings. By
taking advantage of heterogeneity across product categories and sellers, we examine how
consumer responses to certification vary across markets that differ in concentration and in
underlying quality uncertainty, and how certification’s impact varies with sellers’ scale
and reputation.
Institutional features of the eTRS program – especially the fact that sellers gain
and lose eTRS certification abruptly – allow us to cleanly identify the impact of quality
certification on demand. Thus, we avoid potential correlation between unobserved firm
quality and certification status, which can cause endogeneity problems in studies of
purely observational data. Specifically, we are able to isolate and analyze cases where
sellers list identical items at the same price with and without certification, enabling us to
capture the impact of certification on demand, holding price (and other attributes)
constant. Moreover, our data include information about the number of times a listing is
served to consumers as a search result and also how frequently a listing’s detailed
webpage is displayed. This enables us to control for the “advertising” impact of
certification, and to separate this from its informational content on seller quality. In most
contexts, it is difficult to make this distinction: for example, Consumer Reports puts topranked items first, and may not even list lesser-quality products.
A priori, it is unclear how differences in market attributes affect the impact of
certification on consumer demand. If transaction risk, conditional on observables, is
identical across sellers then certification’s premium could be independent of the
proportion of certified sellers in the marketplace. Alternatively, if a scarcity of certified
sellers is interpreted by consumers as a sign of significant quality concerns in the
marketplace, certification’s value may be decreasing in the proportion of certified sellers.
There is similar ambiguity in the case of market concentration. Certification may be an
increasingly useful means of “vertical” differentiation as horizontal product market

competition intensifies; alternatively consumers may view the additional benefits to a
particular product’s certification as having a fixed value, unrelated to the number of other
products in a category. Our findings offer some guidance in assessing which of these
effects dominate empirically.
To provide a conceptual underpinning for the empirical regularities we do
observe, we present a simple theoretical model based on unobserved seller quality,
imperfect customer feedback, and the assumption that eBay has an information advantage
relative to buyers. The model highlights an intuitive mechanism relating eTRS prevalence
to the certification premium: In product categories with lower average seller reliability,
fewer firms obtain certification and the value of certification is thus greater since it
carries more informational content. Modeling competition as horizontal product
differentiation, we also show that eTRS status will have a greater impact on sales
probability in more competitive categories (holding price constant), since vertical
differentiation is more valuable in the face of intense product market competition. The
model also generates the straightforward prediction that the value of outside certification
becomes less important (for high-quality sellers) as the seller accumulates customer
feedback.
Our analysis begins by documenting that gaining eTRS certification – displayed
to consumers via a small eTRS “badge” on all of a seller’s listings – is associated with a
significant increase in demand even when controlling for the impact of certification on
the listing’s prominence in search results. Across our sample, certification increases by
7% the probability that a given seller’s fixed-price listing ends successfully with a sale.
Combined with price sensitivity estimates, our findings imply that consumers will pay
about 7% more for eTRS-badged items. For an item with the median price (£14) in our
matched data, a price difference of £0.89 will generate equal sale probabilities between
badged and unbadged items for a given seller. Our estimates suggest that, in aggregate,
sellers who gained eTRS certification earned an additional £26.8 million in the year
following introduction of the eTRS program, or roughly £1,110 per certified seller.

4

We then proceed to analyze how market and seller attributes affect the value of
certification. First, we show that in categories with few other badged listings – where we
argue that concerns of unobserved seller quality are most prevalent – the impact of
certification is much greater. For listings in categories at the 25th percentile of eTRS
listing frequency, certification’s impact is roughly 50% greater than in markets at the 75th
percentile. Second, we also find that the eTRS badge has greater effects in markets that
are less concentrated, measured by category-level Herfindahl indices, consistent with the
view that vertical differentiation is more valuable when product market competition is
more intense. The badge’s impact is almost twice as large in eBay markets at the 25th
percentile of seller concentration relative to those at the 75th percentile.
We then document the link between seller-level reputation and the value of
certification. In the eBay marketplace, a seller’s record of prior transactions is
summarized as a publicly-observed cumulative feedback score. Consistent with feedback
serving as a substitute for eBay’s own quality certification, we find that sellers with
scores in the 25th percentile of those in the matched sample have an increase in sale
probability from the badge that is 45% greater than the badge effect of sellers at the 75th
percentile. Thus, certification’s impact is amplified for sellers with relatively few past
sales transactions, who have not yet had the opportunity to demonstrate their reliability to
prospective buyers via a record of satisfactory transactions.
Finally, we examine whether growth in eTRS certification generates a “business
stealing” effect by reducing the sales of competitors. We find that an increase in eTRS
prevalence has a negative effect on other sellers in a category, particularly alreadycertified ones, consistent with more widespread certification promoting greater
competition among high-quality sellers. Collectively, our findings highlight that the
impact of quality certification on a particular seller – and hence the seller’s incentives to
acquire and maintain certification – depends on the characteristics of both the seller and
the market, and generates a differential competitive impact on uncertified versus certified
sellers.

5

We emphasize that while eBay serves as a particularly convenient context for
studying these issues, the questions we address have implications for the role of
certification across a wide range of consumer products and certification mechanisms. For
example, Consumer Reports recommendations or a Good Housekeeping Seal of
Approval may have different effects on sales of irons versus high-end espresso makers
due to differences in market attributes. This also implies that quality assessment
organizations should take market conditions into account in designing certification
mechanisms, and that one-size-fits-all accreditations may not be optimal. Given the
ubiquity and importance of services rated by such accreditation bodies – from hospitals to
child care to education – understanding how to tailor certification mechanisms to “local”
circumstance is an issue of first-order importance.
We contribute to a literature that has previously focused on the impact of quality
certification in individual markets. Jin and Leslie (2003), for example, demonstrate that
the introduction of restaurant hygiene report cards in Los Angeles resulted in consumers
sorting toward cleaner establishments and a reduction in the incidence of food-related
illnesses. In later work, Jin and Leslie (2009) go on to compare certification’s impact on
chain versus non-chain establishments in a study of the interaction among certification,
reputation, and cross-restaurant information spill-overs, but they are unable to perform
the type of cross-market analysis that forms the core of our paper.
In a similar spirit to Jin and Leslie (2003), Wimmer and Chezum (2003) find that
certified racehorses sell for higher prices and go on to have better racing careers than
uncertified horses. Improved sorting can allow the benefits of quality certification to
extend to low-quality products, as Tadelis and Zettelmeyer (2011) describe in a field
experiment looking at a used car auction market. Ramanarayanan and Snyder (2012)
examine a public grading system for dialysis centers, and show that centers with low
grades serve fewer well-informed patients, and that these low grades motivate centers to
improve performance. Some evidence exists, however, suggesting that certification’s
impact may be attenuated by features of the institutions and market studied. Xiao (2010)
shows that certification has little impact on demand in the market for childcare services if

6

alternative quality information is already provided by firms, while Ho (2012) describes
how grade inflation and grading inconsistency may subvert the goals of restaurant
hygiene systems in a variety of US cities. 2 In a study of quality assurance mechanisms
introduced on eBay’s platform in the United States, Hui et al. (2013) document the
reduction in certification’s impact when a new buyer protection program was added to
the website. To our knowledge, we are the first to examine how differences in marketlevel attributes affect consumers’ responses to certification.
More broadly, our paper is a part of a growing literature on the role of qualityassurance mechanisms in stimulating trade. Much of this work has been motivated by the
growing importance of e-commerce and has been enabled by the increasing ease with
which detailed information may be collected from online marketplaces. Lewis (2011)
analyzes used car listings on eBay, and finds that sellers’ voluntary provision of quality
information helps alleviate adverse selection. eBay’s official reputation mechanisms,
specifically whether a seller opens a “store” on the site or qualifies for (the now defunct)
PowerSeller certification, also stimulate trade, as Saeedi (2012) finds in a study of the
iPod market. eBay sellers may also signal trustworthiness through their charity
commitments, at least until they develop the performance track records necessary to
indicate reliability (Elfenbein, Fisman, and McManus 2012). Not all quality-assurance
programs are successful, however, as Roberts (2011) reports that a warranty program for
online tractor sales is unable to substitute for more traditional measures of seller
reputation. Similarly, Luca (2011) examines the impact of changes in on-line Yelp ratings
on restaurant industry sales and finds minimal impact on the sales of chain restaurants.

2

In some cases, firms’ pursuit of quality certification can have unintended or perverse effects. Dranove et
al. (2003) show that hospitals may decline to treat severely sick patients in order to avoid risking poor
grades in New York’s hospital “report card” program, while Forbes, Lederman, and Tombe (2012) explore
the incentives of airlines to manipulate arrival times to improve records of on-time arrivals. In all of these
studies (and in our own), the certifying organization is a government body or market-maker seeking to
promote trade by providing information that the firms will not or cannot credibly provide independently.
As discussed in Jin and Leslie (2003), selection effects in firms’ reporting decisions may undermine the
benefits of voluntary information disclosure. There is also a rich literature on self-interested third-party
intermediaries (for example, Moody’s) that provide quality information about firms, while also perhaps
pursuing their own profit maximizing objectives or seeking to please the market participants (often firms)
that underwrite their existence (e.g., Becker and Millbourn 2011).

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe the
features of the eBay UK platform and the Top-Rated Seller program. In section 3, we
outline the main assumptions and predictions of an illustrative theoretical model, which
we develop fully in the Appendix. In section 4, we discuss the construction and
characteristics of the data. Section 5 presents the empirical analysis, and section 6
concludes.

2. Background and setting
A. eBay’s United Kingdom auction platform
Founded in the United States in 1995, eBay has emerged as one of the world’s largest
online marketplaces. In 2012, the site claimed over 100 million users globally, with
goods valued at over $68 billion traded on the eBay platform. 3 A United Kingdom site,
www.ebay.co.uk, was launched in 1999 and became by 2012 eBay’s second most active
marketplace, after the US-based site. According to the web information provider Alexa,
ebay.co.uk’s global web traffic rank in 2012 was 85, and sixth within the UK; by
comparison www.ebay.com, was ranked 23 worldwide and seventh in the US that year. 4
The main features of eBay’s UK platform mimic those of the US-based platform, which
have been described extensively in other studies (e.g., Bajari and Hortascu 2004, Hauser
and Wooders 2006, Lucking-Reiley et al. 2007, Elfenbein and McManus 2010). There
are, however, several noteworthy differences. First, prices for items on the site are listed
in pounds rather than dollars. Second, sellers are mainly UK-based with a relatively small
proportion coming from other European countries and also China and Hong Kong. Third,
shipping prices are generally for standard economy shipping through the Royal Mail
within the UK. Finally, a larger fraction of items on the UK platform are listed for sale at
fixed prices (instead of auctions) than on the US site 5 and a greater proportion of items
are listed by professional sellers.

For example, in the digital camera category on October 9, 2012, 98 percent of 9,634 items for sale in the
UK were listed at a fixed price vs. 80 percent of 55,241 items on the US site. For new digital cameras, the

B. The Top-Rated Seller (eTRS) program
Buyers on eBay purchase products they cannot inspect from sellers with whom they
cannot have face-to-face communication, and whom they trust to deliver the product after
payment is received. As a result, this marketplace is vulnerable to misrepresentation of
products by sellers, and service problems ex post (e.g., packaging the product in such a
way that it might be damaged in shipping, shipping the product late, etc.), not to mention
outright fraud. Easy entry (and exit) from these marketplaces by sellers exacerbates this
set of problems (Brown and Morgan 2006).
Since its founding, eBay has relied on a feedback system to allow buyers and
sellers to generate public track-records about following eBay norms and being reliable
transaction partners. When an eBay user is the seller in a transaction, his eBay feedback
score increases by 1 if the transaction’s buyer provides positive feedback; conversely, the
feedback score is reduced by 1 if the buyer leaves negative feedback. When an eBay user
acts as buyer in a transaction, he may receive positive feedback from the seller but not
negative feedback. Webpages of products listed for sale on eBay include a display of the
seller’s feedback score and his fraction of positive feedback. A potential buyer also has
the option of visiting a separate webpage to examine feedback ratings and comments the
seller received on items sold in the previous 90 days.
Although this feedback system has been effective in supporting trade at an
aggregate level, researchers have shown that the feedback system is vulnerable to
manipulation (see, for example, Bolton et al. 2012; Brown and Morgan 2006; Dini and
Spagnolo 2009). To augment the feedback and reputation system, eBay introduced
Detailed Seller Ratings (DSRs) in 2007 and the eBay Top-Rated Seller (eTRS) program
in 2009. 6 Under the DSR program, in addition to providing positive or negative feedback
and comments, buyers have been asked to rate sellers following a transaction along four

figures are 99.7 and 95.4 percent, respectively. See Einav et al (2013b) for a discussion of the decline of
auctions on eBay.
6

Prior to the eTRS program, eBay reported a seller’s PowerSeller designation (none, bronze, silver, gold,
platinum, or titanium) as a quality signal. PowerSeller levels were based largely on sales volume, however,
and eBay designed eTRS certification to be more informative about per-transaction expected quality.

9

dimensions: Was the item received as described by the seller? Was the seller’s
communication effective? Was the product shipped in a timely manner? And were the
shipping and handling charges reasonable? Each of these questions is rated on a fivepoint scale. If the buyer chooses to do so, he can find the average scores along these
dimensions displayed in graphical form as well as the number of ratings on which the
average is based by clicking through to the seller’s profile page (the link to this page is
provided on each product listing page).
To become a Top-Rated Seller in the UK when the program started in 2009,
sellers had to meet a number of requirements pertaining to time the account had been
active, transaction volume, percentage of positive feedback, and DSR ratings. 7
Specifically, Top-Rated Sellers needed to have at least 100 transactions or £2000 of sales
in the prior year with UK (or Irish) buyers, a positive feedback rating of at least 98%, and
minimum average DSR scores of 4.6 out of 5. Furthermore, sellers could have no more
than 0.5% or two instances of DSR ratings of 1 or 2 in the prior three months (if 400 or
more transactions) or in the prior twelve months (if fewer than 400 transactions in the
past 3 months). Additionally, Top-Rated Sellers had to be registered as businesses on
eBay, and had to include a comprehensive returns policy within each listing.
While a seller’s average DSR scores are publicly visible, eBay has an
informational advantage relative to consumers in its ability to track instances in which the
seller received very low DSR ratings on individual transactions. Many sellers on the eBay
marketplace may have similarly high DSR averages or cumulative feedback scores, so
the eTRS badge is essentially a statement about the (low) probability of a certified seller
providing severely unsatisfactory service. In the absence of the eTRS badge it would not
be easy for consumers to predict whether a seller would meet the eTRS certification
standard. Correlation between DSR scores and eTRS status is positive but small (ranging
from 0.12 to 0.15), and likewise for seller feedback.

7

The qualifications necessary for the eTRS badge have evolved since the program was introduced, and
now includes limits on the number of open “buyer protection cases.”

10

Top-Rated Seller status is assessed monthly. On the 20th day of each month, eBay
evaluates seller performance over the three months prior to that date (or twelve months
for sellers with fewer than 400 transactions). Changes in eTRS status are effective at the
time of this assessment, and open listings are updated dynamically to reflect the current
seller status. Thus, if a seller’s performance at the beginning of a calendar month pushes
her performance metrics above the eTRS threshold, she will receive a badge when eBay
makes its next monthly assessment. 8 Similarly, if a seller’s slipping performance in a
given month leads her to fall below the eTRS threshold she would keep her badge until
the next assessment. A seller’s eTRS status applies across all categories in which she
posts listings, regardless of the extent of the seller’s performance within a particular
category.
The first eTRS badges appeared on seller listings in the UK in late September
2009. During the period we study, the eTRS badge was a small ribbon with the words
“Top Rated Seller.” Beginning one month into the program, the badge was also displayed
next to the product title on the search results page (see Figure 1). This enabled buyers to
distinguish between listings sold by eTRS and non-eTRS sellers prior to viewing pages
with detailed product descriptions and purchase options. The eTRS badge was also
displayed alongside other seller information on the product description pages (see Figure
2). Finally, the eTRS badge appeared on the seller information page (see Figure 3).
In addition to displaying the eTRS badge on the results and listings pages, eTRS
sellers also received other benefits. In particular, eTRS sellers received discounts (up to
20%) on final value fees paid to eBay, and as of late November 2009 improved search
standing for listings in Best Match search results. 9 The Best Match search results were
delivered through a proprietary and ever-evolving algorithm. For many users, Best Match
was the default method through which search results were displayed, but users could also

8

We encountered in the data only a small number of off-schedule adjustments to sellers’ eTRS status, and
we account for these changes in the same way we treat standard eTRS updates. Most transitions in and out
of eTRS certification occur on the 20th of the month.
9

Identical fee discounts were also provided to high-volume sellers whose performance was below the
eTRS threshold.

11

sort results by time, price, or distance. In our empirical analysis, we will thus take
considerable care in accounting for a particular listing’s visibility in search results.

3. Illustrative model and empirical predictions
Before proceeding to the data, we discuss the theoretical framework we use to organize
and interpret our analysis. We focus on the intuitions gleaned from a more formal
modeling exercise, which we include in the Appendix. As we noted in the introduction,
the predicted relationships between market attributes and the impact of certification on
consumer demand are not clear a priori. The purpose of this section is to show that the
effects that dominate in our empirical analyses can easily be reconciled with standard
models of competition augmented by unobserved quality.
We are interested, broadly speaking, in how seller and market characteristics
affect consumer response to quality certification. In the case of intensity of product
market competition, we rely on prior art to frame our analysis. The first model we
describe in this section encapsulates the intuition that vertical differentiation is more
valuable in circumstances where firms are more similar to each other in their horizontal
attributes. Specifically, consider a standard Salop (1979) circular city model where
evenly-spaced firms sell to uniformly distributed consumers with binary demand. The
true quality of seller i is captured by the parameter αi, representing the likelihood that a
seller offers an error-free transaction (αi < 1). Suppose, for simplicity, that seller types
are either high (H) or low (L), with αH > αL. Absent feedback or certification, all sellers
are perceived as having reliability E(α), reflecting the prevalence of reliability levels in
the overall population of sellers. In this framework, quality certification of seller i
informs consumers that αi = αH. Holding prices fixed (consistent with the quasiexperiments we examine), quality certification will induce an increase in quantity
demanded that is independent of initial market share. This implies larger proportional
changes to market shares when initial shares are smaller, as is the case when N is greater.
In summary: A seller experiences a larger percentage increase in sales due to
certification when the seller is in a more competitive market.

12

In the second part of the Appendix, we provide a discussion of the construction of
E(αi) based on information about sellers that accumulates over time. We presume
consumers can observe public feedback, quality certification, and a measure of how
“risky” a product market might be; we collect these pieces of information in Ωi for seller
i. We specify a simple two-period model to highlight an intuitive set of predictions that
we analyze in the data. We retain the assumption that sellers differ in their unobserved
quality – either high or low. Sellers operate in a single category, and the distribution of
seller quality varies across product categories (markets). This variability may result, for
example, from product attributes such as ex ante verifiability of product quality and/or
the likelihood of breakage in delivery. After each transaction, a buyer has the opportunity
to provide publicly observable feedback. Prior to any transactions, eBay also may
observe, with some probability, a perfectly informative signal of seller quality. We
assume that, on the basis of this independent signal, a seller is given eTRS status if eBay
learns that the seller is of high quality. Consumers use Bayes’ rule to form beliefs about
E(αi|Ωi) based on the feedback a seller has received combined with the seller’s eTRS
status.
Our spare model delivers two further predictions that relate seller and market
attributes to the value of certification for consumers: (1) Certification’s impact is
decreasing in the fraction of sellers in an industry that are quality-certified, and (2)
Certification’s impact diminishes with the accumulation of buyer feedback, since the two
serve as substitutes for one another. The former prediction is driven by the fact that since
average seller quality is lower when certification is rare, buyers update more strongly in
response to certification. It is worth reiterating that in practice the eTRS requirements are
the same regardless of the ease or difficulty of selling in a particular category, so it is
plausible that differences in the category-level prevalence of certification are the result of
differences in sellers’ unobserved ability to meet eBay’s eTRS standards while serving a
particular market.

13

4. The data
A. Sample period and data extract
We examine a large data extract from eBay’s UK platform. The extract includes data on
individual listings that conclude between September 29, 2009 (the eTRS program’s first
day) and October 31, 2010. For 44,658 sellers who ever attain eTRS status during the
program’s first year, we observe their full collection of listings during the sample period.
These “eTRS sellers” account for 113 million listings in the data extract. We also observe
all listings by an additional 1,982 sellers who approach but do not achieve eTRS status
during the sample period; this accounts for 7 million listings. Finally, eBay provided a
10% sample of listings from the entire UK marketplace, excluding those sellers for which
we have complete data. The 10% sample contains 33 million listings from 2.2 million
distinct sellers. The relative sizes of the extract’s components implies that the UK
marketplace hosted approximately 450 million listings during the 13 month sample
period, with 25% coming from sellers who held eTRS status at some point during this
time.
The listing data provide information on a product’s seller and the product itself;
each listing’s selling format (e.g. true auction or fixed price); the number of units
available and sold; listing details such as start date, end date, number of photos displayed,
and shipping fees; the fixed price or auction starting price, as appropriate; and for
auctions the data provide the number of bids, selling price, and maximum bid value. We
also observe the number of times a listing was shown to consumers (an “impression”) as
part of a list of search results within a product category or following a consumer’s query,
and the number of times consumers click-through to the listing’s full webpage (a “view”).
Seller and listing characteristics, including the presence of an eTRS badge, affect eBay’s
algorithm for serving search results to consumers, so controlling for the numbers of
impressions and views is important for separating the informational effect of the eTRS
badge from its effect on a listing’s visibility in buyer searches.
We supplement the listing data with a panel of seller-level data. For the sellers
with complete listing data, we observe their complete eTRS badge history. We see

14

detailed seller ratings (DSRs) and feedback scores monthly. Finally, we observe the
annual and quarterly summaries of transactions and revenue that eBay uses to evaluate a
seller’s eTRS status, and the permanent seller characteristics of “age” (time since first
transaction on eBay) and home country (90% are British, with the remainder primarily
from China and Hong Kong).
We observe each item’s location in eBay’s hierarchy of product categories, and
identify a product’s market based on its eBay “leaf category,” which is the most specific
product classification in the eBay hierarchy. The listings in the data extract are drawn
from over 8,000 distinct leaf categories, which themselves are members in one of 33 toplevel categories. For example, within the top-level category “Consumer Electronics,”
there is a leaf category for the 4GB Apple iPod Mini model. The variety of products
within a leaf category is determined, in part, by the eBay market thickness for a class of
products, and there will be variation across categories in the substitutability of products
that are grouped together.
We use the full listing data, the seller characteristics, and the leaf category codes
to create several panels of market-level data. The panels summarize weekly activity on
the eBay UK marketplace. Within each week and leaf category, we count the number of
listing-days associated with each active seller, the number of units sold, revenue
collected, and the seller’s eTRS badge status. We then aggregate these data within a
market-week, and calculate market concentration measures like Herfindahl-Hirschman
Indices (HHIs) and shares of all listings, sales, and revenue that originate with eTRSbadged sellers. 10 We assume that a category’s market structure and eTRS share are
uncorrelated with unobserved factors that might drive category-level differences in
consumers’ responses to the eTRS badge.

10

We combine the 10% and 100% samples of sellers’ listings by weighting the latter group’s listings and
transactions by 0.1 while calculating market activity summaries.

15

B. Matching procedure and sample characteristics
From the data extract we assemble two types of “quasi-experiments,” which we label
“ST” (seller-title) and “STP” (seller-title-price) matches, respectively. An ST-match
consists of a group of two or more listings from a single seller that use the same title,
subtitle, and selling format (e.g. fixed price). 11 An STP-match is a group of items listed
by the same seller that use the same title, subtitle, selling format, and posted price or start
price, as appropriate based on selling format. We have used this approach in our earlier
work (Elfenbein, Fisman, and McManus 2012), as have Einav et al. (2013a) in other
research using data from eBay’s US platform. A large proportion of eBay listings from
high volume sellers can be matched in this way. Among the 113 million listings in the
data extract from eTRS sellers, over 100 million can be included in a match. There are
many instances where a seller’s eTRS status differs between listings in a match as a result
of an individual seller having gained or lost eTRS status. Under the assumption that this
within-match variation in eTRS status is exogenous with respect to demand, product, and
seller characteristics, the differences in eTRS status provide an opportunity to credibly
estimate certification’s impact on demand This is plausible in our setting because small
changes in seller attributes produce a discrete change in eTRS status around the eTRS
eligibility threshold. (One potential concern is that STP-matches might not represent pure
quasi-experiments, as sellers can adjust prices in response to receiving eTRS status.
Empirically, we find no evidence that sellers respond in this way to certification, as we
discuss in Section 5 below.)
Starting with the full collection of 100 million matched listings, we exclude 38
million auction-style listings from our analysis, since these listings account for
considerably less trade on eBay UK than fixed price offerings. 12 We then drop 18 million
fixed-price matches with an average posted price below £4.95 or above £500; virtually all
11

eBay identifies three major selling formats: “fixed price,” “store fixed price,” and “auction.” In our
discussion we use the term “fixed price” to describe the first two selling formats, although we separate
these formats in creating the matches. This implies that format-specific differences in average listing
outcomes are picked up by the match fixed effects we introduce below.

12

The fixed price listings captured by our matching procedure result in transactions that have total revenue
value that is six times as large as the value of the matched auction listings.

16

dropped listings have prices below the lower threshold. About 17% of the remaining
listings are eliminated because the seller did not change eTRS status during the sample
period (most often because the seller received certification immediately and never lost it).
We also drop a small share of additional observations because of missing data, unusually
large quantities offered within single listings, or other irregularities. Ultimately, we are
left with a sample of approximately 31 million listings by sellers for whom we have
complete data. Within these listings, we restrict our attention to the 16.3 million listings
that have within-match variation in the quantity of items sold (i.e., whether an item sold
in the case of single-item listings). 13
In Table 1 we summarize the listing-level characteristics of the final set of ST
matches. Out of 16.3 million listings, 52% have an eTRS badge when the listing ends and
27% finish with the sale of one or more units of the seller’s product. Many fixed-price
listings feature multiple units. For these listings our data provide the quantities available
and sold. At the data medians, listings are active for 10 days, include one photo of the
item for sale, and have a shipping fee of £1.50. Listings typically appear in categories that
are fairly competitive as measured through HHI, which is not surprising given the ease of
becoming an eBay seller; however, there is wide variation in HHI across categories. For
the sample of matched listings, the average category-level eTRS share is 24%. The mean
price is £26.32 (median £12.99) for successful transactions, which is slightly below the
average posted price among the matched listings. The average number of units sold per
listing (0.67) is greater than the overall success rate due to successful sales of multiple
units from a single listing.
Our sample of 16.3 million fixed-price listings contains data from 22,801 sellers,
whose characteristics are summarized at the bottom of Table 1. The median seller has
134 listings across 13 ST matches. The mean and median feedback scores are 4268 and
13

If we were to retain observations with no variation in the outcome variable, the coefficient on eTRS
would be biased toward zero in our linear probability model. The intuition is as follows: a binary-outcome
econometric model’s latent equation can contain a non-zero eTRS effect while allowing a large negative
fixed effect to match an empirical result that all items in a group fail to sell. The linear probability
specification makes no distinction between the latent and observed models, however, and when no objects
in a group sell the least-squares estimates of all coefficients are pushed toward zero. (The same argument
applies to a group of listings in which all items sell.)

17

1562, respectively, indicating that this group of sellers is well-established on the eBay
platform. The median seller has 202 successful transactions per quarter and £3472 in
revenue; the means for these variables are about three times the median values. Finally,
despite their size, the sellers generally have a small share of the total number of listings
or quantity within each item’s category.

5. Empirical analysis
We begin by demonstrating that eTRS improves seller outcomes, holding seller and
listing attributes constant, and then examine three predictions that relate the value of
certification to market structure and seller reputation: (1) eTRS will have a greater effect
on sales probability in product categories where eTRS is rare; (2) eTRS will be more
valuable in more competitive (low HHI) categories; and (3) the positive effect of eTRS
on sales probability will be amplified for sellers without long transaction histories. We
focus throughout on the matched data where title, subtitle, and seller are identical in order
to reduce concerns of unobserved differences across sellers or products. In most cases we
additionally limit the sample to observations where listing prices are identical as well.
The basic econometric specification for the matched analysis is:
𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑖 = 𝜇𝑚 + 𝑋𝑖 𝛽 + 𝛾𝑒𝑇𝑅𝑆 𝐵𝑎𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑖 + 𝛿𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑡𝑖 × 𝑒𝑇𝑅𝑆 𝐵𝑎𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑖

(1)

+𝜃𝑆𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑟𝑖 × 𝑒𝑇𝑅𝑆 𝐵𝑎𝑑𝑔𝑒 𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖 .

The dependent variable Sale is an indicator for whether a listing i ends with a sale. In
some specifications we replace Sale with Quantity, measured as the log of one plus the
count of items sold in a listing. There is a fixed effect µ for each group (m) of matched
items; the vector X captures additional observable variation in listing characteristics
within the group of matched items, such as impressions, number of photos, and listing
duration. We note that both product and seller fixed effects are absorbed by µ. A seller’s
eTRS status is captured by the variable eTRS Badge, with the parameter γ as the marginal
effect of the badge on Sale. When we turn to examine the heterogeneous effects of

18

certification we also include the interactions between eTRS Badge and vectors of market
and seller characteristics. The error term ε accounts for additional variation in outcomes
across listings. In estimating the parameters in (1), we cluster standard errors at the seller
level.
We estimate the parameters in (1) using standard linear regression methods.
While this approach does not account for the discrete nature of the dependent variable
Sale, we are able to include a large number of match-level fixed effects (µ) which would
be computationally demanding in nonlinear models. Further, this approach sidesteps the
problems associated with interpreting interaction terms in these nonlinear models. Where
possible below, we focus on STP matches to eliminate concerns about estimating γ when
sellers might re-price following a transition in certified status. We note that our potential
concerns about re-pricing – and hence whether price variation is exogenous in ST
matches – are alleviated by additional empirical analysis, reported in Table S1 in the
supplementary online appendix, which shows that a change in badge status results in a
precisely measured zero average change in posted price. To the extent that sellers change
strategies after acquiring eTRS status, it may occur through the number and value of
items listed on eBay rather than price-setting. 14

A. Base effects of the eTRS badge
In Table 2, we report the results from our initial estimation of (1), restricting the
interaction coefficients δ and θ to equal zero. We include a full set of controls on a
listing’s timing, duration, shipping fees, and number of photos, but exclude these
parameters from Table 2 to make the presentation more concise. See Table A1 in the
Appendix for the full set of parameter estimates.
Specifications 1-5 in Table 2 employ Sale as the dependent variable, while
specifications 6-8 use Quantity. In specification 1 we estimate the full effect of the eTRS
badge on sale probability in Seller-Title-Price (STP) matches, inclusive of the effect of
14

While we find some evidence that sellers lower their shipping fees after receiving certification, this
unusual pattern appears to pose no problems for our core intuition or inference.

19

eTRS on search ordering. We find that listings with the badge are 2.2 percentage points
more likely to sell, about 8% higher than the base success rate of 27% for unbadged
items. In specification 2 we use the log of one plus the number of impressions to control
for the effect of the eTRS badge on a listing’s position in search results, and we interpret
the new estimate of γ to be the “informational” effect of the badge on sale probability.
While the magnitude of the badge effect falls slightly, we still find a relatively large
impact (7%) on sale probability. 15 The estimate of γ is virtually unchanged when we
include the log of views in the model (specification 3), although a consumer’s decision to
view an item could be affected by the quality-relevant informational value of a badge. In
specification 4 we analyze ST matches, which can contain variation in the fixed price of
the product, and find a slightly larger estimate of γ. In this specification we observe that
the sale probability falls significantly with the log of an item’s fixed price. The
coefficient on the interaction between log(Price) and eTRS Badge (specification 5) is
small in magnitude and statistically insignificant, indicating that both badged and
unbadged items have similar price elasticities. 16 In both the tables and associated text that
follows we use Badge as a shorthand for eTRS Badge when referring to interaction terms.
As a final robustness check, in in specifications 6-8 we employ the log of one plus
quantity sold as the dependent variable, and obtain results that are qualitatively similar to
those on the sale probability. In specification 6, which controls for the number of

15

To further ensure that the coefficient in this specification can be attributed to the informational content of
eTRS, we have also tried specifications that control more flexibly for impressions. When we replace log(1
+ impressions) with a set of 9 dummy variables that capture the deciles of percentage differences between a
listing’s number of impressions and the match’s mean impressions, we obtain a nearly identical estimate of
γ.
16

As noted above, we take this price variation to be exogenous, possibly as a result of experimentation by
the seller. (See Einav et al. (2013a) for an extensive discussion of seller experimentation on eBay’s US
platform, and its usefulness in estimating the slope of demand.) The presence of product-specific fixed
effects and time trend controls allay many of the usual concerns about price endogeneity. Our finding of
zero average price response from receiving the badge, noted above, further validates the use of this
variation in our demand-side analysis.

20

impressions, we find that Quantity increases by 4% with the addition of the eTRS
badge. 17
In Appendix Table A2, we provide a number of further robustness checks for our
estimates of γ. To account for possible within-match heterogeneity in listing attributes, in
specification 1 we repeat our main analyses with a much more stringent match
requirement, where within a match all listings are identical in terms of title, subtitle, and
price, as well as number of photos, shipping fee, scheduled length, quantity available.
Our estimate of eTRS’s impact on demand within these ‘super-matches’ is very similar to
that obtained in our main analysis. In the second specification of Table A2, we limit our
sample to listings where there had been a change in eTRS status between the current
month and either the preceding or next one, and in the third specification we include only
listings that conclude in the 20-day period spanning the ten days prior to an eTRS status
change and the ten days following it. By focusing on the window immediately around
status changes, we are better able to isolate demand-side responses to eTRS from possible
post-certification seller responses or time trends. We obtain point estimates that are very
similar to those in Table 2, and when we apply the appropriate baseline sale probabilities
(based on the sample window) to these coefficients, we find that the eTRS badge shifts
the sale probability by 8% in both cases. Finally, we report results using the fraction of
time during an item’s listing period when the seller held eTRS status (rather than an
indicator variable for eTRS status at the end of listing); once again the point estimate
indicates a similar impact of eTRS status on demand.
We report a summary of the badge’s effects on impressions and views in
Appendix Table A3 – as expected, eTRS has a positive effect on both outcomes.
Interestingly, once impressions are accounted for, eTRS has no incremental impact on
listing views. These regressions, along with the nearly 20% difference in the estimates of
γ between columns 1 and 2 in Table 2 above, illustrate the importance of controlling for
the prominence effects of certification in assessing its (informational) impact.
17

We calculate this increase using the point estimate (0.0171) of the badge’s effect on log(1+Quantity), and
the average value of quantity (0.66) among unbadged listings in the ST sample.

21

Our estimates of the badge effect and the slope of demand also allow us to
calculate the trade-off eBay consumers make between quality certification and price.
Given the parameter estimates in Table 2 and each listing’s characteristics, it is
straightforward to calculate the predicted sale probability for each unbadged item in the
matched sample. It is also possible to compute the value of ∆ such that an unbadged item
with the original price pu has the same sale probability when it is offered at the price of pu
+ ∆ by an eTRS seller. For the fixed-price listings in the matched sample, the mean value
of ∆ is £1.65 and the median value is £0.89. As a percentage of price, the additional
willingness-to-pay has a mean of 6.7% and median of 6.8%. When we compute the same
price increments using the estimates from specification 8 to equate the expected quantity
sold in a listing, we obtain a mean ∆ = £1.27 and a median of £0.88.
The analysis above allows us to calculate the value created for sellers by the eTRS
badge within the matched sample. Using estimates from specification 6 in Table 2, we
calculate total incremental revenue for listings in the STP matched sample due to the
eTRS badge: there are 7.4 million eTRS listings in the STP sample, with an average sale
price of £26.29, and the coefficient estimate of 0.0171 implies an increase in quantity
sold of 0.0285 per listing. Hence the increment to revenue is £5.6 million (£7.4 million if
we remove controls for impressions). Extrapolating this estimate to include all eTRS
listings, we calculate that the eTRS badge produced £26.8 million in incremental revenue
for eTRS sellers. 18

B. Market characteristics, seller characteristics and the impact of eTRS certification
Our main contribution is in using our matched data to analyze how product market
structure and seller characteristics affect the impact of eTRS certification on demand. We
examine these effects by estimating (1), with a focus on parameters δ and θ, which
represent the interaction between eTRS Badge and market characteristics and seller

18

In the 12 months following the introduction of the program, a total of 25.3 million fixed-price items were
listed with eTRS status, and the average sale price for listings by sellers who received the eTRS badge at
some time during this period was £27.92.

22

characteristics, respectively. In particular, we examine the predictions from section 3, that
the impact of certification on demand should decline in market concentration, the
proportion of sellers in a product category with certification, and the observable track
record of the seller.
Table 3 presents our main results; we follow with a discussion of a number of
alternative specifications and robustness checks, with results provided in a series of
online appendices. In all regressions, we control for impressions, so we interpret our
estimates of the market and seller characteristics’ effect on eTRS badge value as
representing changes in impact due to information rather than listing visibility.
We begin by examining in specification 1 the impact of industry concentration on
the value of certification by including the interaction of eTRS Badge and the categorylevel variable Listings HHI in (1). We divide all HHI statistics by 1,000 so that the
regression coefficients are easy to read. The coefficient on the badge-HHI interaction is 0.00374, and significant at the 1% level. The attenuating effect of concentration is
consistent with the intuition captured by the simple circular city model described in
Section 3 above. The estimated coefficient is economically meaningful: it implies that the
badge’s effect at the 25th percentile of Listings HHI (118) is 10% greater than the effect at
the 75th percentile HHI value (610). Listings HHI has an extremely long right tail, raising
the concern that this result may be driven by outliers. We therefore employ the
transformed variable, log(Listings HHI) (which has a smooth, normal distribution) in
specification 2; these results imply a much larger reduction in the badge’s impact (47%)
between the 25th and 75th percentiles of HHI.
In specification 3, we examine how the value of certification varies with the
category-level prevalence of eTRS by including an interaction between eTRS Badge and
eTRS Share, the fraction of listings (in the most narrowly defined category) with eTRS
status. The coefficient is -0.0477, significant at the 1% level. Moving from the 25th to 75th
percentile of eTRS Share (14% to 31%), the estimates imply a reduction in the badge’s
effect by one-third. This result, too, is consistent with the modeling exercise described in
Section 3, where consumers infer that categories with a greater proportion of certified

23

listings have fewer quality problems, thus reducing the difference in performance
expected from sellers with and without certification. In specification 4 we include both
Listings HHI X Badge and eTRS Share X Badge simultaneously. The coefficient on the
eTRS Share interaction is virtually unchanged, while the Listings HHI interaction loses its
significance. One concern with this specification is that very highly concentrated
categories will, almost by definition, take on extreme values on eTRS Share,
mechanically increasing variation in this variable due to market structure rather than
inherent category risk. This occurs most strongly at the upper tail of the HHI distribution,
and replacing Listings HHI with its log transformation reduces impact of extreme HHI
values. In specification 5, when we use the log(Listings HHI) to represent market
concentration, we find that both interaction terms retain significant explanatory power.
Next, in specification 6 we examine the prediction that certification and seller
track record are substitutes, through the inclusion of log(Feedback) X Badge. Consistent
with the two forms of quality signals serving as substitutes, the coefficient on the
interaction terms is negative, taking on a value of -0.00335 (significant at the 1% level).
Moving from the 25th to 75th percentile of seller feedback entails a reduction in the
badge’s impact by 30%. In specification 7, we include all three interactions – log(Listings
HHI) X Badge, eTRS Share X Badge, and log(Feedback) X Badge – simultaneously, and
find that all three variables continue to have significant explanatory power.
To address the concern that there may be category-level attributes correlated with
eTRS share or concentration that also affect eTRS value, in Table 4 we include fixed
effects for each of eBay’s 33 meta-categories interacted with eTRS Badge. This set of 33
interactions absorbs, at least at the meta-category level, any unobserved category
differences correlated with concentration or eTRS prevalence. Our findings are largely
unaffected by the inclusion of these additional terms.
In each specification above, our estimate of certification’s impact on demand is
based on the assumption of a particular (linear) parametric relationship between the
badge and (a function of) market or seller attributes. We allow for greater flexibility in
the way that certification’s impact is affected by market and seller attributes in Table S2

24

in the supplementary appendix, which also provides a more straightforward interpretation
of effect magnitudes. When we include interactions of eTRS Badge and indicator
variables for HHI quartiles, we obtain coefficients that imply that the effect of
certification is more than twice as large for listings in the lowest (most competitive) HHI
quartile relative to the highest quartile. When we interact eTRS Badge and indicator
variables for quartiles of eTRS Share, we find that the coefficients on these interaction
terms are monotonically decreasing in eTRS Share quartile. The effect of certification is
2.5 times higher for listings in low eTRS Share versus high eTRS Share categories.
Finally, we show the interactions of eTRS Badge with Feedback quartile dummies – the
coefficients are decreasing with seller feedback, and the implied effect of certification is
over twice as large for low versus high feedback sellers.
Finally, in Table S3 in the supplementary appendix, we repeat our main analyses,
employing alternative measures of market concentration based on quantity sold. Our
results are insensitive to the particular definitions of market concentration we employ –
are findings are virtually unchanged when using quantity-based measures in place of
listings.

C. Competitive impact of eTRS badge
The estimates above indicate how a given seller’s outcomes improve upon receipt of
certification, conditional on her own characteristics and the characteristics of the market
in which she competes. It is unclear, however, whether the positive impact of certification
on demand represents purchases that otherwise would not have occurred, or whether the
increased sales due to certification for a given seller may come at the expense of sales by
competitors. Moreover, if it is the case that certification’s increase in demand comes at
competitors’ expense, is unclear which types sellers stand to lose the most when rivals
receive certification. For example, if sellers who gain the badge predominantly gain
market share from unbadged rivals, then certification programs may bolster market
concentration among (differentiated) high quality firms, On the other hand, if sellers who
gain the badge draw market share only from badged rivals, this may promote robust

25

competition at the high-quality end of the market. A decisive analysis of the full welfare
effects of shifts in market share would require a considerably more detailed model and
appropriate data, but our consideration of these issues may help to inform the design of
certification institutions, and also indicate useful directions for future work.
We examine the “business stealing” effect of certification using a variant on
Equation (1) that examines sales probability within a given STP match as category-level
eTRS prevalence varies, holding seller eTRS status constant. In these analyses, we are
identifying the impact of changes in eTRS prevalence based on category-level changes in
the prevalence of eTRS across a set of STP matches. For example, a seller may post one
listing that closes on the 15th of the month (before eTRS update) and a second identical
one closing a week later on the 22nd. As a result of eTRS updates on the 20th, eTRS
prevalence may have changed within the listing’s category, allowing us to identify the
effects of eTRS prevalence using within-match estimates. Thus, our estimating equation
is:
𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑖 = 𝜇𝑚 + 𝑋𝑖 𝛽 + 𝜑𝑒𝑇𝑅𝑆 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖

(2)

where eTRS Badgei is held constant within m. We estimate (2) with an expanded dataset,
which includes matched listings from the 10% platform-wide sample plus those of eTRS
sellers whose badge status does not change. In preparing this data we retain the same
filters for included listings as we describe in Section 4.B for our main matched sample
(i.e., fixed price listings only, price between £4.95 and £500, and so forth).
We present our estimation results in Table 5. In specification 1 we report the
estimate of equation (2)’s parameter ϕ within the set of STP matches where eTRS Badge
= 0. The coefficient is negative and significant at the 1% level, indicating that a 10
percentage point increase in category-level prevalence of eTRS listings reduces the
probability of sale for non-certified sellers by 0.4 percentage points. (This change in
eTRS share is approximately equal to the within-category standard deviation of monthly
eTRS shares, 0.087.) In specification 2, which presents analogous results for STP

26

matches where eTRS Badge = 1, the coefficient on eTRS prevalence is nearly twice as
large, indicating an even greater business stealing effect from certified sellers. The
relative sizes of ϕ across un-badged and badged sellers may be due to a crowding of the
quality ladder at the top end when the eTRS share increases. Thus, while all sellers
experience reductions in their sales probability when more competitors are certified,
those sellers who are certified themselves are more severely affected.
In specifications 3 – 6, we further disaggregate sellers based on their sales volume
in the month prior to listing. In the first pair of specifications we compare the effect of
eTRS prevalence on unbadged sellers, further disaggregated based on whether their
revenue for the previous three months was above £3000, and in the second pair of
specifications we present results for badged sellers, split at the same revenue threshold. In
both pairs of results, the coefficient on eTRS prevalence is more negative for smaller
sellers, indicating an attenuated effect of business stealing on high-volume sellers. In
terms of a percentage impact on sales probabilities, this difference becomes more modest
in magnitude once one accounts for the baseline difference in sales probability (0.33
versus 0.28 for small versus large sellers respectively). 19 While the difference between
specifications 1 and 2 indicate more competition within the badged population than
across the certified versus uncertified, these results on seller size suggest that larger
sellers may be more successful at differentiating themselves from their badged
competitors. In specifications 7-10, we examine whether the effect of eTRS prevalence
differs for high versus low priced items, subdividing the sample based on whether a
listing’s price is above £14. For both badged and unbadged sellers, the coefficient is more
negative for high-priced listings (the sales completion probability is identical (0.29) for
both listing types). This finding is consistent with a greater business-stealing effect of
certification for transactions where high-priced items are associated with a greater
concern over seller misrepresentation or opportunism. These differences in the impact of

19

The listings included in Table 5’s analysis must have variation in Sale within a fixed badge status, which
yields the differences between these success rates and the STP-sample mean value of .27 reported on Table
1.

27

rising eTRS prevalence further underscore the differential impact that certification may
have on sellers with different attributes.

6. Conclusion
As Arrow (1972) famously noted, “virtually every commercial transaction has within it
an element of trust.” Private-party certification is one mechanism that enables transaction
partners to overcome this trust problem. In theory, certification improves market
performance by providing information to buyers that enables them to assess seller quality
and attach differences in willingness-to-pay to sellers of various quality levels.
We provide a detailed investigation of a quality certification program on eBay’s
UK website. This certification program identified “top-rated sellers” who were able to
meet a strict set of performance criteria. We use a uniquely rich dataset, with a large
number of eBay sellers who offer the same products for sale while transitioning in and
out of the certified group, to identify the impact of quality certification on demand. Our
data are also valuable in that they span a very large number of product categories which
differ in their levels of competition, further allowing us to examine how the effects of
quality certification are affected by market structure.
We find that gaining certification raises the odds of selling a given item by 7%.
Holding sale probability constant, the value of certification is equivalent to an increase in
£0.89 per item, or roughly 6.7% at the median values in the data. Moreover, we find that
the incremental value of certification to a seller depends on both market and seller
characteristics. Sellers with more extensive transaction histories – information that is
available to buyers – benefit less from certification than sellers whose quality is relatively
less easy to judge. Thus, certification may facilitate entry and/or the expansion of new,
high-quality sellers. Additionally our analysis suggests that gaining certification has
greater value for sellers in markets that are more fragmented. Thus, the incentives
provided by certification to improve or maintain quality are greater in more competitive
marketplaces. The benefits of certification depend on the degree to which competitors
possess certification as well: the incremental value of certification to a seller is highest

28

when there are few certified rivals. These patterns have implications for market design
and firm strategy, and are clearly deserving of future empirical and theoretical attention.
(Van der Schaar and Zhang (2014) represent one step in this direction.)
Moreover, our results raise some interesting questions about the impact of
certification programs on the evolution of markets. The differential benefit of
certification for new versus established players suggests that certification may enable
high-quality entrants to grow faster, making concentrated markets more competitive. On
the other hand, new entrants of low quality, i.e., sellers that will not attain certification,
are at a greater disadvantage in the presence of many other certified sellers, potentially
leading them to exit rapidly or deterring their entry altogether. Our results also suggest
that these dynamics will be affected by the design of the certification program,
specifically whether the quality threshold is set in such a way that enables few versus
many market participants to obtain it. We view the dynamic relationship between firm
reputation and size, market concentration, and certification design to be a fruitful area for
future research.
Our findings have implications for the impact of quality certification within and
across many markets. We would predict, for example, that Consumer Reports
recommendations or a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval have different effects on
sales of irons versus espresso makers due to differences in market attributes. Moreover,
our results suggest that the value of accreditations for high-stakes decisions like hospitals
or childcare may vary with local market structure conditions, which could expose some
shortcomings in one-size-fits-all public policy recommendations. Our full set of findings
is applicable in an array of online markets too, where customer feedback is
commonplace, as are expert assessments. The technology review site CNET, for
example, offers links to all products in a given category (e.g., HDTVs or desktop
computers), while also highlighting those that its reviewers have highlighted as “Best in
category.” As with eBay, we expect the value of CNET’s certification would vary by the
extent and quality of reader feedback, and also the market structure of a given category.
By contrast, Yelp, whose paid business subscribers are given the opportunity to choose

29

which reviews to feature prominently, may find that the value of the ability to affect the
presentation of quality assessments changes as more competing businesses subscribe to
the service.
Our work may be extended in a number of directions. In this paper, we have
focused on a demand-side response to certification. But it is possible – indeed likely –
that over time eTRS status may induce sellers to enter new categories or increase the
number of listings they post. We defer this supply-side analysis to future work.
Finally, while our emphasis in this paper has been on the heterogeneous effects of
certification as a function of market conditions, one could similarly analyze how the
benefits of other quality signals may vary with industry conditions. Empirically, our
setting has the advantage of discrete shifts in certification status that allow us to generate
credible estimates of certification’s benefits. In future work we hope to develop
approaches to extend our work to assess the heterogeneous impact of firm reputation and
other quality assurance mechanisms.

Appendix

1. Product market competition and the value of certification
We model product market competition as a variant on Salop’s (1979) circular city.
Consumers are distributed with unitary mass around a circle of unit circumference. N
sellers, each with marginal cost of c, are spaced evenly around the circle. 20 For
consumers, we assume linear travel costs t and utility from the good of u. Sellers differ in
their ability to successfully complete transactions. We assume that αi represents the
probability that the ith seller completes transactions successfully. We model reliability as
being a binary attribute, with low-type (high-type) sellers having reliability of αL (αΗ). In
the absence of additional information on individual seller quality, consumers expect
utility from the good of E(α)u, where the expectation of α simply comes from the
fraction of high types in the seller population, which we assume to be φ. Without
additional information on a seller, E(α) = (1 – φ)αL + φαΗ.
We assume travel costs are sufficiently high that all consumers buy from one of
the two closest firms. A consumer located a distance x from seller i is indifferent between
buying from i and his neighbor i + 1 if:

E(αi)u – pi – tx = E(αi+1)u – pi+1 – t(1/N – x)

For the simple symmetric equilibrium case where all firms have the same expected
reliability, E(α), seller i’s demand is given by qi =(p – pi + t/N)/t, where p is the
equilibrium price. Maximizing profits with respect to pi generates p = c + t/N, with
market shares of 1/N.
Within the context of this symmetric equilibrium, consider the effects of seller i
obtaining certification from eBay, assuring consumers that αi = αH. Holding the prices of
other sellers constant, i's demand becomes:
20

Since we will take the number of firms as exogenous, we ignore fixed (entry) costs.

42

qi = [p – pi + (αH – E(α)) + t/N]/t

If seller i keeps his price constant – effectively the situation that we capture with our
seller-title-price matched dataset – then seller i's demand increases to 1/N + [αH – E(α)]/t.
The percentage increase in demand from certification is thus given by:

[(1/N + [αH – E(α)]/t) – 1/N]/(1/N) = N[αH – E(α)]/t

That is, since there is a fixed increase in demand from certification, in proportional terms
the impact is increasing in product market competition N.

2. Seller feedback, category quality, and the value of certification
We again assume there are two types of sellers: high-types that complete transactions
successfully with probability αH, and low-types that are successful with probability αL,
and that the overall frequency of high-type sellers is φ, so the share of low-type sellers is
(1 – φ). Before the seller posts any listings, eBay observes the seller’s true quality with
probability λ. If eBay observes that the seller is type H, eBay awards it an eTRS badge,
so that B = 1. In all other cases, B = 0. After each transaction, consumers make a public
feedback announcement f. Consumers report f = 1 if the transaction was good, and f = 0
if the transaction was bad.
We examine consumer inferences about seller quality for the seller’s first two
trades. Before deciding whether to buy a product, potential consumers observe the
seller’s state, (F,N,B). F is the sum of all prior feedback, N is the number of completed
trades, and B is badge status. F, N, and B each take values in {0, 1}.
We define the badge premium as π(𝐹, 𝑁) = 𝐸(α|𝐹, 𝑁, 1) − 𝐸(α|𝐹, 𝑁, 0). By

assumption 𝐸(α|𝐹, 𝑁, 1) = α𝐻 regardless of F and N. Consumers calculate 𝐸𝑈 =

𝐸(α|𝐹, 𝑁, 𝐵)𝑢 − 𝑝, where u is gross value from a perfect transaction and p is price.

43

We next provide some definitions that simplify our exposition. Let wL and wH
represent non-negative constants, and use them to form the probability weights ρL and ρH.
We construct ρa = wa/(wH + wL). Clearly ρH + ρL = 1. Holding wL fixed, ρL is decreasing
in wH, while ρH is increasing. For the expected value 𝐸(α) = ρ𝐻 α𝐻 + ρ𝐿 α𝐿 , it follows

from the construction of the ρ and w terms that greater values of wH for fixed wL imply
greater values of 𝐸(α).

Our interest is in modeling how consumers’ beliefs about seller type evolve over

rounds of trade and differ across product categories, which then allows us to compare
certification premia across different seller and category traits.

A. Seller feedback and the value of certification
Before the first round of trade
Before any trade has occurred a seller has F = N = 0, and B is equal to 0 or 1. The
probabilities of the two possible seller states are:
𝑃𝑟(0,0,1) = λϕ

𝑃𝑟(0,0,0) = (1 − λ)ϕ + (1 − ϕ).

The

certification

rules

immediately

provide

two

conditional

probabilities:

𝑃𝑟(α𝐻 |0,0,1) = 1 and 𝑃𝑟(α𝐿 |0,0,1) = 0. Applying Bayes’ rule, the additional

conditional probabilities are:

(1−λ)ϕ

𝑃𝑟(α𝐻 |0,0,0) = (1−λ)ϕ+(1−ϕ)
(1−ϕ)

𝑃𝑟(α𝐿 |0,0,0) = (1−λ)ϕ+(1−ϕ) .

A consumers who sees B = 1 immediately infers E(α|0, 0, 1) = αH. Alternatively, in state
(0, 0, 0) the consumer calculates:

44

𝐸(α|0,0,0) =

α𝐻 (1−λ)ϕ+α𝐿 (1−ϕ)
.
(1−λ)ϕ+(1−ϕ)

Note that this expected value can be written as E(α|0, 0, 0) = ρH αH + ρLαL with
appropriately defined probabilities ρa. The badge premium π(0,0) = αH – E(α|0,0,0) is
positive. This is clear from the probabilities ρH < 1 and ρL > 0 in E(α|0,0,0).

Before the second round of trade
A seller’s first round of trade will yield feedback f, so F will be 0 or 1. N automatically
increases to 1. The seller’s certification state, B, does not change. Possible seller states
are (0, 1, 0), (1, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1), and (1, 1, 1). The various states’ probabilities are:
𝑃𝑟(0,1,0) = (1 − α𝐻 )(1 − λ)ϕ + (1 − α𝐿 )(1 − ϕ)
𝑃𝑟(1,1,0) = α𝐻 (1 − λ)ϕ + α𝐿 (1 − ϕ)
𝑃𝑟(0,1,1) = (1 − α𝐻 )λϕ
𝑃𝑟(1,1,1) = α𝐻 λϕ.

These state probabilities yield the following conditional probabilities:

𝑃𝑟(α𝐻 |0,1,0) = (1−α
𝑃𝑟(α𝐿 |0,1,0) = (1−α
𝑃𝑟(α𝐻 |1,1,0) = α
𝑃𝑟(α𝐿 |1,1,0) = α

(1−α𝐻 )(1−λ)ϕ

𝐻 )(1−λ)ϕ+(1−α𝐿 )(1−ϕ)

(1−α𝐿 )(1−ϕ)

𝐻 )(1−λ)ϕ+(1−α𝐿 )(1−ϕ)

α𝐻 (1−λ)ϕ
(1−λ)ϕ+α
𝐻
𝐿 (1−ϕ)

α𝐿 (1−ϕ)
.
(1−λ)ϕ+α
𝐻
𝐿 (1−ϕ)

Note again that for all states with B = 1, 𝑃𝑟(α𝐻 ) = 1. The relevant expected values are
thus:

45

𝐸(α|0,1,0) =
𝐸(α|1,1,0) =

α𝐻 (1−α𝐻 )(1−λ)ϕ+ α𝐿 (1−α𝐿 )(1−ϕ)
(1−α𝐻 )(1−λ)ϕ+(1−α𝐿 )(1−ϕ)

α2𝐻 (1−λ)ϕ+ α2𝐿 (1−ϕ)
(1−λ)α𝐻 ϕ+α𝐿 (1−ϕ)

.

We use these expressions to calculate certification premia, and also to compare the
premia to those that obtain prior to the first round of trade. Consider the difference
between the no-feedback premium, π(0,0) = αH – E(α |0,0 0), and the premium with one
unit of positive feedback, π(1, 1) = αH – E(α |1,1 0). This difference is:
π(0, 0) − π(1, 1) = 𝐸(α|1, 1, 0) − 𝐸(α|0, 0, 0)
=

α2𝐻 (1−λ)ϕ+ α2𝐿 (1−ϕ)
(1−λ)α𝐻 ϕ+α𝐿 (1−ϕ)

−

α𝐻 (1−λϕ)+ α𝐿 (1−ϕ)
(1−λ)ϕ+(1−ϕ)

.

We simplify the difference by replacing wH = (1 – λ)φ and wL = (1 – φ), and dividing the
numerator and denominator of E(α|1,1,0) by αL:

π(0, 0) − π(1, 1) =

α𝐻 (α𝐻 /α𝐿 )𝑤𝐻 + 𝛼𝐿 𝑤𝐿
(α𝐻 /α𝐿 )𝑤𝐻 + 𝑤𝐿

−

α𝐻 𝑤𝐻 + α𝐿 𝑤𝐿
𝑤𝐻 + 𝑤𝐿

.

Next, we set (α𝐻 /α𝐿 )𝑤𝑤𝐻 = 𝑤𝑤
� 𝐻 , and note that 𝑤𝑤𝐻 < 𝑤𝑤
� 𝐻 . Following the properties of ws

discussed above, we see that the premium difference is positive, so that the certification
premium is greater when no feedback has yet occurred.
While it is possible to also generate comparisons across different F/N ratios, the

precise properties would depend on the precise specification of how we model feedback,
and in any event our results on the case of F = N serve as the clearest representation of
the link between more positive feedback and the value of certification.

B. Cross-category comparisons on the value of certification
We now augment the model by assuming that some product categories are riskier than
others; we further assume that sellers do all of their trade in a single category. We model

46

category risk through φ, and say that category j is riskier than k if φj < φk. Holding fixed
the eBay investigation parameter λ (as is the case in practice) fewer sellers will receive B
= 1 in a higher-risk category because there are fewer high-quality sellers.
We constrain F = N and let πj(F) be the certification premium in a category with
high-quality share φj. We compare premia across categories through the difference πj(F)
– πk(F) for φj < φk. If we extrapolate our expression for E(αH|1,1,0) expression above to
the general case of F, we may write the relevant difference as:

π𝑗 (𝐹)– π𝑘 (𝐹) =

𝐹+1
α𝐹+1
𝐻 (1−λ)ϕ𝑘 + α𝐿 (1−ϕ𝑘 )
𝐹
𝐹
α𝐻 (1−λ)ϕ𝑘 +α𝐿 (1−ϕ𝑘 )

𝐹+1
α𝐹+1
𝐻 (1−λ)ϕ𝑗 +α𝐿 (1−ϕ𝑗 )

−

𝐹
α𝐹
𝐻 (1−λ)ϕ𝑗 +α𝐿 (1−ϕ𝑗 )

Replacing 𝑤𝑤𝐻𝑘 = α𝐹𝐻 (1 − λ)ϕ𝑘 and 𝑤𝑤𝐿𝑘 = α𝐹𝐿 (1 − ϕ𝑘 ), and defining analogous values
of wHj and wLj, we may write the difference as:

π𝑗 (𝐹) – π𝑘 (𝐹) =

α𝐻 𝑤𝐻𝑘 + α𝐿 𝑤𝐿𝑘
𝑤𝐻𝑘 + 𝑤𝐿𝑘

−

α𝐻 𝑤𝐻𝑗 + α𝐿 𝑤𝐿𝑗
𝑤𝐻𝑗 + 𝑤𝐿𝑗

1−ϕ

.

ϕ

Next, multiply the wLk terms by 1−ϕ𝑗 and the wHk terms by ϕ𝑗. This yields:
𝑗

π𝑗 (𝐹) – π𝑘 (𝐹) =

𝑗

ϕ
1−ϕ𝑘
α𝐻 𝑤𝐻𝑗 ( 𝑘 )+ α𝐿 𝑤𝐿𝑗 (
)
ϕ𝑗
1−ϕ𝑗
ϕ𝑘
1−ϕ𝑘
)
𝑤𝐻𝑗 ( )+ 𝑤𝐿𝑗 (
ϕ𝑗
1−ϕ𝑗

−

α𝐻 𝑤𝐻𝑗 + α𝐿 𝑤𝐿𝑗
𝑤𝐻𝑗 + 𝑤𝐿𝑗

.

Notice that we have eliminated wHk and wLk. We now multiply the top and bottom of the
1−ϕ

first term by (1−ϕ 𝑗 ) to get:
𝑘

π𝑗 (𝐹) – π𝑘 (𝐹) =
with

� 𝐻𝑗 + α𝐿 𝑤𝐿𝑗
α𝐻 𝑤
� 𝐻𝑗 + 𝑤𝐿𝑗
𝑤

−

ϕ

α𝐻 𝑤𝐻𝑗 + α𝐿 𝑤𝐿𝑗
𝑤𝐻𝑗 + 𝑤𝐿𝑗
1−ϕ

𝑤𝑤
� 𝐻𝑗 = 𝑤𝑤𝐻𝑗 � ϕ𝑘� �1− ϕ 𝑗�

47

𝑗

𝑘

The final remaining step is to show that 𝑤𝑤
� 𝐻𝑗 > 𝑤𝑤𝐻𝑗 , which follows directly from the
ϕ

1−ϕ

assumption that ϕ𝑗 < ϕ𝑘 , since both � ϕ𝑘� and � 1− ϕ 𝑗� are greater than one. Thus,
𝑘

𝑗

certification’s value will be greater in markets where certification is rarer due to category
risk.
