ABSTRACT
This paper investigates the determinants of informal economic activity. We present two equilibrium
models of informality and test their implications using a survey of 48,000+ small firms in Brazil. We
define informality as tax avoidance; firms in the informal sector avoid tax payments but suffer other
limitations. In the first model there is a single industry and informal firms face a higher cost of capital
and a limitation on size. As a result informal firms are smaller and have a lower capital labor ratio.
When education is an imperfect proxy for ability, we show that the interaction of the manager's education
and formality has a positive correlation with firm size. These implications are supported by our empirical
analysis. The second model highlights the role of value added taxes in transmitting informality. It predicts
that the informality of a firm is correlated to the informality of firms from which it buys or sells. The
model implies that higher tolerance for informal firms in one production stage increases tax avoidance
in downstream and upstream sectors. Empirical analysis shows that, in fact, various measures of formality
of suppliers and purchasers (and its enforcement) are correlated with the formality of a firm. Even
more interestingly, when we look at sectors where Brazilian firms are not subject to the credit system
of value added tax, this chain effect vanishes.

Introduction

In this paper we investigate the determinants of informality. It is difficult to define
informal activities unambiguously, but estimates indicate that in 1990-1993 approximately 10% of GDP in the United States was produced by individuals or firms that
evaded taxes or engaged in illegal pursuits. It is also estimated that these activities produce 25 to 35% of aggregate output in Latin America, between 13 to 70% in
Asian countries, and around 15% in O.E.C.D. countries. (see Table 2 in Schneider
and Enste [20]).
Informality creates a fiscal problem, but there is also growing evidence that
informal firms are less efficient,1 perhaps because of their necessarily small scale,
perhaps because of their lack of access to credit or access to the infrastructure of
legal protection provided by the State. In many less developed countries, creating
incentives for formalization is viewed as an important step to increase aggregate
productivity.
We present two related equilibrium models of the determinants of informality
and test their implications using a survey of 48,000+ small firms in Brazil. In both
models informality is defined as tax avoidance. Firms in the informal sector avoid
paying taxes but suffer from other limitations.
The first model can be seen as a variant of Rausch [17], who relied in the
modeling strategy of Lucas [14] in which managerial ability differs across agents in
the economy, and assumed a limitation on the size of informal firms. We make a
modification that generates additional testable implications. In addition to labor,
the firms in our model use capital and informal firms face a higher cost of funds.
This higher cost of capital for informal activities has been emphasized by DeSoto [5]
who observed that because the right to assets held by the poor are not typically well
documented “these assets cannot readily be turned into capital...[and] cannot be used
as collateral for a loan. . . ”.2 This difference in interest rates induces a higher capitallabor ratio in formal firms.3 As in Rausch [17], agents with lowest managerial ability
become workers and the ones with highest ability become formal managers, with
1

Case studies reported in McKinsey [15] document that the ratio of labor productivity between
informal and formal firms is, on average, 39% in Turkey and 46% in Brazil.
2
DeSoto [5], p.5-6. DeSoto [4] estimates that in June/85, informal firms in Lima (Peru) faced a
nominal interest rate of 22% per-month, while formal firms paid only 4.9% per month. We estimate
a much smaller, but still significant, difference in capital costs between informal and formal firms in
our sample. Straub [21] develops a model in which a dual credit system arises in equilibrium.
3
Informal firms may face lower labor costs, because their workers avoid some labor taxes. This
would induce even larger differences in capital-labor ratio.

the intermediate group running informal firms. This is because managers with more
ability would naturally run larger firms and employ more capital; for this reason they
choose to join the formal sector, where they do not face limits on capital deployment
and face a lower cost of capital. The marginal firm trades off the cost of paying taxes
versus the higher cost of capital and the scale limitations of informal firms. As a
result, the marginal firm would employ in the informal sector less capital and labor
than it would employ if it joined the formal sector. Thus, as in Rausch [17] or Fortin
et al. [8], a size gap develops. Managers that are slightly more efficient than the
manager of the marginal informal firm employ discretely larger amounts of capital
and labor.
In this class of models, entrepreneurs that operate in the informal sector are
too inefficient to benefit from the lower capital costs and scale economies afforded to
formal entrepreneurs. In this sense these models agree with the results from a survey
of informal Mexican firms conducted by Mckenzie and Woodruff that is reported in
Fajnzylber et al [7], where 75% of the respondents reported that they were too small
to make it worth their while to become formal.4
Several implications of this model are supported by our empirical analysis
on Brazilian data. Formalization is positively correlated with the size of firms and
measures of the quality of the entrepreneurial input. Even after controlling for our
measures of the quality of an entrepreneur, formalization is correlated with a firm’s
capital-labor ratio or investment per worker. In addition, after controlling for the
quality of the entrepreneur, formalization is correlated with higher profits.
The model predicts a correlation between manager’s ability and the size of
firm. Since a manager’s ability predicts formality, formality should give no additional
information concerning size, once we condition on a manager’s ability. Since ability
is not observable, we study the implications of a model in which one can observe
a variable, say educational achievement, that is correlated with a manager’s ability.
We show that a regression of the size of the firm on this observed variable and the
interaction of the observed variable and formality should produce positive coefficients.
This implication is supported by our empirical results.
The main focus of our theoretical analysis is a model that highlights the role
of value added taxes in transmitting informality. It exploits the idea that collecting
value added taxes according to a credit scheme sets in motion a mechanism for the
transmission of informality. The value added tax is a prevalent form of indirect taxa4

...presumably relative to cost.

4

tion: more than 120 nations had adopted it by 2000.5 In the credit or invoice method
that is often used, the value added tax applies to each sale and each establishment
receives a credit for the amount of tax paid in the previous stages of the production
chain. This credit is then used by the taxpayer against future liabilities with the
tax authorities. Since purchases from informal suppliers are ineligible for tax credits,
an incentive exists for the propagation of informality downstream in the production
chain. A similar mechanism also influences firms upstream in the chain: selling to informal firms increases the likelihood for a firm to be informal.6 Our empirical analysis
shows that, in fact, various measures of formality of suppliers and purchasers (and
its enforcement) are correlated with the formality of a firm. These findings survive
when we use instrumental variables to control for possible simultaneity. Even more
interestingly, when we look at sectors where Brazilian firms are not subject to the
credit system of value added tax, but instead the value added tax is applied at some
early stage of production at a rate that is estimated by the State, this chain effect
vanishes.
Since the mid 90’s, following the lead of the Federal government, several Brazilian states introduced SIMPLES programs that simplified and lowered the VAT rates
for small firms. The state of São Paulo, the largest and richest state in the Brazilian
Federation, introduced its SIMPLES in 1998. Rio Grande do Sul, another large and
relatively rich southern state, started its own program only in 2005. We use data on
these two states and two rounds of the Brazilian survey of small firms to evaluate
the impact of the introduction of these state programs. Our results point to a significantly positive impact of the program introduction, increasing the probability of
formalization by approximately one-third.
The models in this paper ignore possible alternative reasons for informality,
such as the fixed cost of complying with regulations, labor taxes or the existence of
a minimum-wage. They also ignore benefits that have been highlighted in the literature — such as access to participation in the legal system and other civil institutions.
Considering these omitted costs and benefits should not change the qualitative implications of our models.
Other papers that investigate causes and determinants of informality include
Loayza [13] and Friedman et al. [9] which provide evidence of an association between
the size of the underground economy and higher taxes, more labor market restrictions,
5

See Appendix 4 in Schenk and Oldman [19].
To our knowledge, the only study to investigate the informal sector in conjunction with a VAT
structure is Emran and Stiglitz [6]. Their focus is on the consequences of informality for a revenue
neutral tax reform involving value added and trade taxes.

and poorer institutions (bureaucracy, corruption and legal environment). Junqueira
and Monteiro [11] and Fajnzylber et al. [7] are recent papers that use an earlier (1997)
wave of the the survey we employ in this paper. They both explore the institution of
the federal SIMPLES, which simplified and reduced rates for tax compliance for small
firms in Brazil, to make inferences on the relation of taxes and informality. Although
our empirical results speak to a somewhat different set of questions (for instance, the
multi-stage transmission of informality captured by our second model), use data from
a different year (2003 versus 1997) and refer to a different definition for formalization,7
their empirical results are broadly in line with the implications of our models. Both
papers find that the enactment of SIMPLES has increased formality through a smaller
tax burden and cheaper formalization costs. In particular, Fajnzylber and co-authors
find that the formalization is associated with more labor and capital stocks as well
as higher productivity, which agrees with the predictions of our models. They fail
to obtain significant effects on formalization of participation in government assisted
programmes (about which our models are silent) and access to formal credit markets.8
In sum, the combination of the models we develop and the Brazilian microdata allows
us to add novel insights to this literature.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section we
develop a model of a single industry, while in Section 3 we treat the model with two
stages of production. Section 4 contains the empirical results obtained using data on
informal firms in Brazil and Section 5 concludes.
7

Junqueira and Monteiro [11] and Fajnzylber et al. [7] use municipal licensing as proxy for
formalization instead tax registration, the measure we use. Junqueira and Monteiro recognize that
tax registration would be a more appropriate indication of formalization, but opt for licensing because
the question on tax registration was only asked for those who indicated that their firm had been
“legally constituted” — that is, a contract had been registered with the proper authorities. We do
not view this as a problem, since according to Brazilian law only legally constituted firms are eligible
for tax registration.
8
In the preliminary version of Fajnzylber et al. [7] that we read, it is not clear how formal credit is
defined, but we believe it refers to bank loans. In our empirical work we use a broader interpretation
of credit — 40% of those who claimed to have obtained loans (25% of the formal entrepreneurs
that claimed loans) did it from non-bank sources. In addition, Fajnzylber et al. [7] focuses on firms
created around the time of the introduction of the SIMPLES in 1996, just after the implementation
of the Real stabilization program, when Brazilian credit markets where much less developed than in
2002. The preliminary version also contains some omissions that prevent us to make more precise
comparisons (for instance, which exogenous covariates they use and whether they control for sector
of activity).

2

A Model with One Production Stage

We consider a continuum of agents; each characterized by a parameter θ ≥ 0 which
indicates his quality as an entrepreneur and is distributed according to a probability
density function g(·). An entrepreneur chooses between becoming a worker, operating
a firm in the formal sector or in the informal sector. We assume that the production
function in the two sectors is identical. If an entrepreneur employs l workers and k
units of capital, output equals y = θk α lβ , with α, β > 0 and α + β < 1.
A formal entrepreneur pays an ad valorem tax rate of τ and faces a capital
cost of rf > 0 per unit. An informal entrepreneur pays no taxes, but faces a capital
cost of ri ≥ rf . All workers are paid the same wage w.
An informal entrepreneur, if detected by the authorities, loses all his profits.
The probability of being detected depends monotonically on the size of the firm.
Though there are several possibilities for measuring the size of the firm - output,
capital stock or labor force - we choose here to use the capital stock (which we
identify in the empirical work as the value of installations), because we imagine the
probability of detection as a function of the “visibility” of the firm. We write p(k) for
the probability of detection. While in the Appendix we discuss a more general form
for the function p we will assume here that:
p(k) = 0, if k ≤ k

(1)

= 1, if k > k,

(2)

that is an informal firm cannot employ more than k units of capital, but will not
suffer any penalty when k ≤ k.
Hence the profit for an entrepreneur of quality θ that chooses to be informal
is given by
Πi (θ, ri ) = max{θlβ k α − wl − ri k},

(3)

l,k≤k

whereas if he chooses to enter the formal sector profits will be:
Πf (θ, rf ) = max{θ(1 − τ )lβ k α − wl − rf k}
l,k

(4)

The capital-labor ratios of formal firms or informal firms that are unconstrained are proportional to the relative prices between labor and capital and independent of the entrepreneur’s ability. Since ri ≥ rf , unconstrained informal firms
have a lower capital-labor ratio than formal firms. In addition, constrained informal
7

firms have a lower capital-labor ratio than unconstrained informal firms. Hence the
capital-labor ratios of informal firms are lower than that of the formal firms, the
difference being bigger the larger is the difference in capital costs between informal
and formal firms (ri − rf ). In Section 4 we provide evidence in favor of the predicted
difference in capital-labor ratios between formal and informal firms.
The usual properties of profit functions guarantee that both Πi and Πf are
convex functions of θ, w and the respective cost of capital, ri and rf . In addition the
capital and labor choices of each type of entrepreneur are monotone. Using the first
order conditions and the envelope theorem one obtains :
β β/(1−α−β) αα/(1−α−β) (1 − τ )1/(1−α−β) (α+β)/(1−α−β)
dΠf

and that, for informal firms that are not constrained:

dΠi
(θ) = α/(1−α−β)
θ

dθ

(6)

r

If 1 − τ ≥ ( rfi )α , taxes are too low with respect to the capital cost wedge and every
entrepreneur prefers to be formal. Since we are interested in the informal sector we
r
assume from now on that 1 − τ < ( rfi )α . In this case, every entrepreneur θ for which
the optimal choice in the informal sector is unconstrained will prefer to be informal.
Let θ be the lowest value of θ for which an informal entrepreneur would choose a
capital stock k̄. For θ > θ the informal entrepreneur would keep k = k̄ and, as a
consequence, in this range:
dΠi
(θ) = cθβ/(1−β) ,
(7)
dθ
for some constant c. Comparison of this last expression with equation (5) above shows
that there exists a unique θ such that Πi (θ) < Πf (θ) if and only if θ > θ.
Each agent also has the choice of becoming a worker and receive the market
wage w. Hence the occupational choice cutoff points are implicitly defined by:
Πf (θ) = Πi (θ)
max{Πi (θ̂), Πf (θ̂)} = w
and optimal choices are:
θ ≤ θ̂ =⇒ Worker;
θ ∈ (θ̂, θ] =⇒ Informal entrepreneur;
θ > max{θ, θ̂} =⇒ Formal entrepreneur.
8

(8)
(9)

Since Πi (0) = 0 and Πf (0) = 0, θ̂ > 0, whenever w > 0. However, if θ < θ̂
then no entrepreneur would choose informality. In any case, equilibrium in the labor
market requires w to satisfy:

Supply of Labor

Demand for Labor

where the arguments remind the reader of the dependence of the cutoffs and labor
demand on the level of wages.
The existence of an equilibrium level of wages is straightforward. Also if k is
small enough then θ < θ̂. Furthermore if θ is sufficiently large, an entrepreneur of
quality θ would choose the formal sector and thus θ̂ is finite. Formal firms always
exist, provided the support of g is large enough.
Another implication of this model is the existence of a discontinuity in the level
of capital and labor employed at levels of productivity around θ. This discontinuity
follows since an entrepreneur with ability just below θ chooses the informal sector and
employs exactly k units of capital, although the marginal product of capital exceeds
his cost of capital. At a level just above θ, an entrepreneur chooses the formal sector
and since he is now unconstrained, he would choose a level k >> k. Furthermore,
1
since we assumed that ri (1 − τ ) α ≤ rf and Πi (θ) = Πf (θ) we know that
Πi (θ) ≤ θlf (θ)β kf (θ)α (1 − τ ) − wlf (θ) − ri kf (θ)(1 − τ )1/α .

(10)

The left (right) hand side of equation (10) is exactly the labor demand by a formal
(informal) entrepreneur with quality θ. Hence labor demand also jumps up in the
transition to formality. Thus our model predicts a “gap” in the capital and labor
employed by firms near the the formalization threshold θ.
The empirical analysis of this gap is complicated because we do not observe
an entrepreneur’s ability θ and the data set we use has no information on interest
rates paid. In order to account for these limitations we assume that entrepreneurial
ability θ = x exp() where  is an unobserved determinant of entrepreneurial skill,
independent of x and with zero expected value and x is some observed variable (or
index of) that also influences entrepreneurship. In our empirical application we take
9

measures of education as proxies for x.9 In this case, one can use the expressions for
optimal input level choices to obtain the expectation of the logarithm of employment
l conditional on the log x and conditional on being in the formal or informal sector.
Taking logs on the optimality conditions for labor demand and replacing θ
with xe , we get the following expression for ln l as a function of x and :

Formalization Effect

Direct Effect

Indirect Effect

We highlight the fact that managerial ability influences the demand for labor
in three ways. A direct effect exists since more productive entrepreneurs will demand
more labor as this factor’s marginal product is higher under better management. An
indirect effect occurs because a better manager will also install more capital, driving up labor’s marginal productivity and hence the demand for labor. However this
indirect effect will not be present for the more skilled informal managers since they
will be constrained. A third effect, which we call Formalization Effect and is local
to θ, occurs as entrepreneurs become formal and start paying taxes. This exerts a
negative effect on the demand for labor which is nonetheless outweighed by the other
two effects as pointed out previously.
If one estimates a linear regression of ln l on ln x and an interaction between
ln x and formalization (θ ≥ θ) as we do in our empirical section for a sample of entrepreneurs, the coefficient on the interaction term delivers the incremental sensitivity
of ln l to ln x due to formalization. This is the sample counterpart of the best linear
predictor of ln l conditional on ln x and 1xe ≥θ . ln x in the population. We represent
this object as
EBLP [ln l| ln x, 1xe ≥θ . ln x; xe ≥ θ̂] = ξ0 + ξ1 ln x + ξ2 1xe ≥θ . ln x
where the conditioning event xe ≥ θ̂ reflects the fact that we use only entrepreneurs.
As one would expect formal entrepreneurs to employ more labor, the last term should
be positive. Intuitively, in order for that to be the case, were there enough flexibility
we would like to make ξ2 positive whenever ln x is positive and negative whenever
9

Lazear [12] characterizes entrepreneurs as “jacks-of-all-trades who need not excel in any one skill
but are competent in many”. In this sense, managerial or entrepreneurial ability is determined in
large part by balanced human capital investment. Even though better proxies may be envisioned (see
for example the empirical application in that article), we take education as a reasonable determinant
for the quality of an entrepreneur.

10

ln x is negative. This is not possible, since ξ2 is fixed. Its sign will depend on the
relatively distribution of ln x between negative and positive values. The following
result can nonetheless be stated and relies on this intuition.
Proposition 1 Let x be a random variable with finite support. If supp(ln x) ⊂ R+
with at least one non-zero element then ξ2 > 0.
Proof. See Appendix.
This result is used in Section 4 to document evidence in favor of our model.

A Model with Two Production Stages

In this section we introduce a model with two stages of production. Our goal is to
illustrate the transmission of informality across sectors which results from the use of
the value added tax. In Section 4 we document that this mechanism is relevant for
the generation of informality in Brazil.
There are two stages of production: “upstream” and “downstream”. All individuals in this model are entrepreneurs and, for simplicity, we assume that they
are specialized in one of the stages. Each entrepreneur in the upstream sector is
characterized by his ability θu > 0. The density of θu is gu (·). An entrepreneur of
ability θu can produce θu units of the intermediate good in the formal sector, but
only min(y, θu ), where y > 0, if in the informal sector.
The downstream entrepreneurs are characterized by an ability parameter θd
with density gd (·). An agent with ability θd , if in the formal sector, produces θd xα
units of the formal good using x units of the intermediate good. However if in the
informal sector he faces a limit on the quantity of input that can be used and the
production function becomes θd min(x, x)α , where x > 0.
We assume that gu and gd are continuous and that there exists θu < y for
which gu (θu ) > 0, and that gd (θd ) > 0 for θd > 0.
The final good is tradeable and has an exogenous price q. Firms in the formal
sector pay an ad-valorem tax rate of τ and we write π = 1 − τ. The value added tax is
levied by the credit method: the tax rate applies to each sale and each establishment
receives a credit for the amount of tax paid in the previous stages of production.
Because of the tax credit, the prices paid for informal and formal goods may be
distinct and we let pf be the price of the intermediate good in the formal sector and
pi in the informal sector.
11

We write
Πuf (θu ) = πpf θu

(11)

Πui (θu ) = pi min{θu , y}

(12)

for the profit of an upstream firm with manager of quality θu if it produces in the
formal (informal) sector. Downstream firms face a slightly more complicated problem,
since they must also choose which intermediate good (formal or informal) to purchase.
Write
Πdf (θd ) = max{max[π(qθd xα − pf x)], max[qπθd xα − pi x]},
x

x

(13)

for the profit of a downstream firm with a manager with ability θd that chooses to
operate in the formal sector. In an analogous manner, write
Πdi (θd ) = max{max[qθd min(x, x)α − pf x], max[qθd min(x, x)α − pi x]},
x

x

(14)

for the profit of a downstream firm with a manager of ability θd that chooses to
operate in the informal sector.
If an informal entrepreneur of ability θd buys the input at a price p then he
demands:

xi (θd , p, q) = min x,

qαθd
p

!1/(1−α) !
.

(15)

In turn, a formal entrepreneur demands, if he buys from the formal sector at a unit
price p:

xf (θd , p, q) =

qαθd
p

!1/(1−α)
,

(16)

while if he buys from the informal sector he demands xf (θd , πp , q), since the tax credit
does not apply.
As in the model with one stage, the demand for the intermediate input, as the
following proposition shows, will exhibit a large enough “discontinuity”.
Proposition 2 If Πdf (θd ) > Πdi (θd ) then the optimal choice of the firm with manager
of quality θd , xf (θd , p, q), where p = pf if the firm’s optimal choice is to buy the formal
good and p = pπi if the firm’s optimal choice is to buy the informal good, satisfies
xf (θd , p, q) ≥

x
> x ≥ xi (θd , p, q),
π

for any θ.
12

Proof : Suppose first that it is optimal for the firm with manager of quality θd to buy
the formal good. If πxf (θd , pf , q) < x, since
qθd (πxf (θd , pf , q))α − πpf xf (θd , pf , q) ≥ π(qθd xαf (θd , pf , q) − πpf xf (θd , pf , q)),
the firm would prefer to be in the informal sector and buy πxf (θd , pf , q) of formal
inputs. If the firm bought the informal good and πxf (θd , pπi , q) < x, since
qθd (πxf (θd ,

the firm would prefer to be in the informal sector and buy πxf (θd , pπi , q) of informal
inputs.

We now derive aggregate demand and supply of the intermediate good in the
formal and informal sectors as a function of prevailing prices. Since we are interested
in equilibrium prices we may restrict the range of prices to 0 < πpf ≤ pi ≤ pf . In
fact, if πpf > pi profit maximization and equations (13) and (14) imply that both
formal and informal entrepreneurs downstream would buy from informal upstream
firms. However, every upstream entrepreneur will prefer to produce in the formal
sector. Similarly, if pi > pf every downstream entrepreneur would prefer to buy from
formal firms. However, small θu agents would prefer to produce informally. Furthermore when πpf ≤ pi ≤ pf downstream informal (formal) entrepreneurs weakly prefer
to buy from informal (formal) producers. If these inequalities are strict, preferences
are also strict. In addition, the homogeneity of the system allows us to choose q = 1
(and hence we omit q as a function argument in what follows).
The following proposition shows the existence of cutoff points for each stage,
θu (pi , pf ) and θd (pi , pf ) such that all managers with ability below the cutoff (weakly)
prefer informality and all those with ability above the cut-off points prefer to join the
formal sector.
Proposition 3 If θu < θu (pi , pf ) =
θu (pi , pf ) =

pi y
πpf

pi y
πpf

≥ y then Πui (θu ) ≥ Πuf (θu ), and if θu >

then Πui (θu ) < Πuf (θu ).

(ii) There exists a θd (pi , pf ) such that if θd < θd (pi , pf ) then Πdi (θd ) ≥ Πdf (θd ) and if
θd > θd (pi , pf ) then Πdi (θd ) < Πdf (θd ).
Proof : (i) is immediate from equations (11) and (12). To show that (ii) holds note
that θd enters the definition of the profit function of formal firms exactly as an output
13

price and hence, from the properties of profit functions with respect to output prices,
we know that its derivative with respect to θd is proportional to xf (θd , p) which goes
to infinity as θd → ∞. Furthermore, the function Πdi (θd ) is convex and, since supply
functions of firms must slope up, if the choice, conditional on informality, of a firm
of ability θ satisfies xi (θ) = x then the optimal choice conditional on informality,
xi (θd ) = x for θd ≥ θ, and as a consequence, Πdi (θd ) is linear for θd ≥ θ. In addition,
whenever xi (θd ) < x, the informal firm’s constraint is not binding. In this case, since
pf ≥ pi
Πdi = ϕ(pi ) > ϕ(pf )

where ϕ(p) = [αα/(1−α) − α1/(1−α) ] qθ

then Πdi (θd ) > Πdf (θd ), provided θd > 0.

Similarly to the model with one stage, the size of firms will be discontinuous with respect to the quality of the entrepreneur.
Proposition 4 (i) If pf > πpi the output of the smallest upstream formal firm
pf y
> y.
πpi
(ii) πxf (θd (pi , pf )) ≥ x and, in particular, the output of the smallest downstream
formal firm is strictly bigger than the output of the largest informal firm.
Proof : (i) is obvious. Furthermore, the entrepreneur θd (pi , pf ) must be indifferent
between being formal or informal. Since informal (formal) entrepreneurs weakly prefer
to buy from informal (formal) suppliers, we must have:


θd (pi , pf )xα − pi x = π θd (pi , pf )xαf (θd (pi , pf )) − pf xf (θd (pi , pf )) .

(17)



Furthermore F (θd ) = θd xα −pi x−π θd .xαf (θd ) − pf xf ((θd )) must satisfy F 0 (θd (pi , pf )) ≤
0. Using the envelope theorem, it follows that
xα ≤ πxαf (θd (pi , pf )).
Since 0 < π < 1 and 0 < α < 1, x ≤ πxf (θd (pi , pf )).

(18)


Because of the possibility of indifference, we have supply and demand correspondences as opposed to functions. We will write S(pi , pf ) for the set of possible
14

aggregate supply vectors (si (pi , pf ), sf (pi , pf )) obtained from the choices of profit maximizing entrepreneurs in the upstream stage. If pi 6= πpf the set S(pi , pf ) contains a

Since we fixed q = 1 we write X(pi , pf ) for the set of possible aggregate demand vectors (xi (pi , pf ), xf (pi , pf )) obtained from the choices of profit maximizing entrepreneurs
in the downstream stage.
When πpf = pi formal firms are indifferent between buying the formal or
informal input, but informal firms prefer buying from informal firms. Hence we
can allocate all formal firms with managers below a certain threshold to buying in
the informal sector with the complement interval assigned to purchase in the formal
sector.11 In this case, a point (xi , xf ) ∈ X(pi , pf ) if there exists a γ ≥ θd (pi , pf ) such
that:

In principle we could assign any subset of entrepreneurs with productivity below y to the informal
sector, but there is always an interval containing the origin that would produce exactly the same
aggregate output.

As before, these assignments can reproduce the demands realized by any arbitrary assignment
of firms to each sector.

An equilibrium is a vector (pi , pf , 1) such that ∃z ∈ X(pi , pf ) S(pi , pf ).
We will decompose the proof of the existence of an equilibrium price in two
steps. First we will set pi = µpf with π ≤ µ ≤ 1. For each µ we will show that there
exists a unique pi (µ) such that if (pi , pf ) = (pi (µ), piµ(µ) ) then the sum of aggregate
supply of the formal and informal intermediate goods equals the sum of aggregate
∗
demands. We then show that there exits a unique µ∗ such that (pi (µ∗ ), piµ(µ∗ ) , 1) is an
equilibrium. We will use the following preliminary result:
Lemma 1 If πpf < pi < pf then θd (pi , pf ) decreases with pi and it increases with pf .
Further, if π ≤ µ ≤ 1 then, θd (pi , pµi ) increases with pi .
Proof : If πpf < pi ≤ pf formal firms prefer to buy the formal good. Hence
∂Πdf (θd )
= −πxf (θd , pf )
∂pf

(29)

Similarly, if πpf ≤ pi < pf , informal firms prefer to buy the informal good, and in an
analogous fashion
∂Πdi (θd )
= −xi (θd , pi )
(30)
∂pi
This establishes the first part of the lemma, since increasing pi reduces profits for
informal firms and increasing pf reduces profits for formal firms.
In order to sign the change in θd (pi , pµi ) we must establish the sign of:
16

1 ∂Πdf (θd ) ∂Πdi (θd )

µ ∂pf

for the marginal firm. If this is negative, the difference in profits in the formal and
informal sectors for the marginal firm decreases and more firms will become informal.

and informality for the marginal firm still equals − πµ xf (θd , pµi ) + xi (θd , pi ).


We now return to the equilibrium analysis. For µ = π (pi = πpf ) the sum of
the aggregate supply always equals

It is easy to check that this last expression goes to zero as pi → ∞ and to ∞ as pi → 0.
Furthermore, since demand of any type decreases with the price of the input, and,
from Proposition 2 xf (θd , pi /π) > xi (θd , pi ), using the Lemma above it is immediate
that aggregate demand is monotonically decreasing with pi . Hence there exists a
unique pi (π) for which the sum of supplies equal the sum of demands.
For π < µ ≤ 1, using expressions (19) and (20) we obtain that the sum of the
aggregate supplies is:

xf (θd , )gd (θ)dθ.

θd (pi ,pi /µ)
Just as before, the result in the Lemma insures the monotonicity properties that yield
the existence of a unique pi (µ) that equates the sum of aggregate demands with that
of aggregate supplies.
Notice that an increase in µ always decreases aggregate supply since it causes
some firms in the upstream sector to switch from formal to informal. In addition,
an increase in µ increases the demand by formal firms at each pi and causes some
firms to switch from informal to formal in the downstream sector. Thus, at each pi ,
aggregate demand goes up. Hence pi (µ) increases with µ.
The supply of the informal sector when pi = πpf is some amount in the interRy
val [0, 0 θgu (θ)dθ]. The demand is some number in the interval
R θ (p ,p /π)
R∞
R θ (p ,p /π)
[ 0 d i i xi (θd , pi )gd (θ)dθ, 0 d i i xi (θd , pi )gd (θ)dθ+ θd (pi ,pi /π) xf (θd , pi /π)gd (θ)dθ].
If these intervals overlap, at pi = pi (π)/π then (pi (π), pi (π)/π) is an equilibrium. This
will happen whenever the tolerance for informality in the upstream sector (y) is high
enough.
If these intervals do not overlap, notice that the informal supply of the intermediate good must necessarily go up with µ. On the other hand, the informal demand at
(pi (µ), piµ(µ) ) will go down since pi (µ) goes up and the relative price of the formal good
Ry
goes down. At µ = 1, the supply of the informal good is 0π max{θ, y}gu (θ)dθ whereas
R θ (p ,p )
the demand is any number in the interval [0, 0 d i f xi (θd , pf )gd (θ)dθ]. Hence there
always exists a unique µ∗ such that (pi (µ∗ ), pi (µ∗ )/µ∗ , 1) is an equilibrium.

3.1

Comparative statics

Simulations of the model show that an increase in tolerance in the upstream sector
increases the proportion of informal firms upstream and downstream. Figure 1 shows
that as y increases, the proportion of upstream firms that are informal increases.
As a result the price of the informal intermediate good pi decreases and some of
the downstream formal firms opt for informality. The fall in demand for the formal
intermediate good causes a fall in its price pf . A symmetric picture arises when we
change the tolerance for informality in the downstream sector, x.

Empirical Application

In this section we explore the implications of the theoretical framework laid out in the
previous section using a dataset on the informal sector in Brazil. Tax noncompliance
is an important phenomenon in this country. Schneider and Enste [20] estimate that
informality represents more than one-quarter of the Brazilian economy. Its value
added tax system was established in the sixties and VAT represents approximately
10% of tax collection.

4.1

Data

Our principal data source is the ECINF survey (Pesquisa de Economia Informal
Urbana) on informal firms realized by the Brazilian Statistics Bureau (IBGE). We
use the 2003 edition of that survey, collected in October 2003, from which we obtain
information on 48,701 entrepreneurs in urban regions from all states in the Brazilian
federation.12 We also use the 1997 edition for the analysis present in subsection 4.9.
The focus is on units with five or less employees and the sampling strategy uses the
demographic census as a frame. Before the survey, preliminary interviews screened
households for the presence of at least one entrepreneur with a business employing
five or less people. Households without such an entrepreneur were not included in the
frame for the survey. The sampling was designed in two stages: in each state (of a
total of 27) the primary sampling units (urban sectors) are stratified geographically
in three strata (capital, other urban sectors in the capital metropolitan area and
remaining urban sectors). In a second step, the primary sampling units were stratified
according to levels of income within the geographical stratum. Urban sectors were
then randomly selected with probability proportional to the number of households
in the sector. From each selected urban sector a total of 16 households was then
randomly selected for interviews.13 . Since the focus of the survey and the definition
of informal economic unit adopted by the Brazilian statistics bureau were those firms
with less than five employees and not those in irregular situation, we do believe
answers were truthful even when individuals were inquired about their status with the
Brazilian tax authorities. Interviewees were made aware that information collected
12

When an entrepreneur owns two firms, this corresponds to two observations in our sample. When
a firm has two partners that live in the same household, this also corresponds to two observations.
Initially we have 48,803 observations which are reduced to 48,701 observations after discarding data
points corresponding to entrepreneurs younger than 15 yrs.-old.

For more information on the sampling strategies employed, see Almeida and Bianchini [1].

for the survey was confidential and would only be utilized for statistical purposes.14
The ideal dataset for testing our second model would comprise information on
the production chain associated to each firm. Although the ECINF contains certain
characteristics of a firm’s clientele (whether they were predominantly large or small
companies, persons or governmental institutions), this information is very limited.
To complement these data we used the input-output matrix information available
from the Brazilian Statistics Bureau (IBGE). We computed inter-sectoral technical
input coefficients and measures of output sectoral destination using the 2003 Brazilian
national accounts.15

4.2

Description of Variables

We eliminated firms with owners who were less than 15 years old and the observations
lacking education or gender information, what restricted our sample to around 48,000
observations.
Table 1 summarizes the main variables used in the study. The first is indicative
of formalization. It is a dummy variable equal to one if the firm is registered with
the Brazilian tax authorities.16 For firms in economic sectors that qualify for forward
tax substitution (see subsection 4.10 for an explanation), taxsub takes the value one.
The next two variables are dummies for firms that sell their products mainly to large
firms (largecl ) or small firms (smallcl ) (where large and small firms are those with
more and less than five employees, respectively). Govcl is a dummy for a firm that
sells mainly to governmental institutions. Other alternatives are persons or ignored.
Outsidehouse is a dummy that equals one when the activity is performed outside the
home. The number of employees (n worker ) includes the owner. Even though the
survey focuses on firms with five or less employees, a few units (less than 0.1%) employ

Tables 1 and 2 under “Tabelas de Recursos e Usos” available under National Accounts on
http://www.ibge.gov.br for 2003. The information is at current 2003 prices (rather than the alternative: previous year monetary units). The construction of technical coefficients follows the
European System of Integrated Economic Accounts (ESA) specifications (see ten Raa [23]).
16
The tax registry is the Cadastro Nacional de Pessoas Jurı́dicas, which replaced the previous
system, the Cadastro Geral de Contribuintes (CGC), used in the 1997 survey. This variable is the
most representative of formalization for our purposes, but we have nonetheless experimented with
using “legally constituted firms” and obtained virtually identical results. This is not surprising,
since, as we mentioned, the latter is a prerequisite tax registration and correlation between the two
measures of informality is 0.98.

20

more than five people due to the lag between the screening and interviewing stages of
the survey and the fact that firms may have multiple partners which are also counted
as employees. The variables revenue, otherjob and bankloan are self-explanatory.
Education is a categorical variable with values depicted on Table 2. Age of the owner
is in years and gender equals 1 for male. The variable ho num is a measure of
wealth and is zero for non-homeowners and otherwise displays the number of rooms
in the house. The variables loginv and loginst measure the logarithm of investments
and capital installations in October/2003 (R$ 1,000).17 Profit equals revenue minus
expenses in October/2003 (also in R$ 1,000). Logwage denotes the logarithm of the
total expenditures in salaries (in R$1,000) divided by the number of employees in the
firm.18 The variables (clform and supform measure formalization among customers
and suppliers of a firm (see subsection 4.7 for the construction of these variables).
[Tables 1 and 2 here]
Each firm in the sample is classified into economic activities following the
CNAE (Classificação Nacional de Atividades Econômicas) classification.19 Using
technical coefficients as well as sectoral output allocation coefficients from the National Accounts System (NAS) (using NAS sector classification) we are then able to
assign to each activity in the survey a vector with those coefficients. Since the survey and National Accounts use different classification schemes we had to match the
activities in both systems. Typically a CNAE activity corresponds to a single NAS
sector, but there are a few exceptions. Whenever such a multiple match occurred,
we assigned to a CNAE sector the weighted averages (using NAS sector production
value) of the coefficients in the corresponding NAS sectors. The ECINF survey also
has its own aggregate sectoral characterization, displayed on Table 4.
We use these coefficients as a vector measure of sectoral allocation of output
and sectoral input assignment by a firm. The last two variables on Table 1 are measures of formalization enforcement for suppliers and customers20 and were constructed
as follows. We used information available from the Brazilian Ministry of Labor on the
number of firms visited in a given economic sector and state during 2002 to monitor
17

The value of installations refers to owned installations. Rented equipment is not included. Only
7% of formal firms and 7% of informal firms reported any rented equipment
18
As a reference, the annual GDP per capita in Brazil for 2003 was R$ 8,694.47 according to IBGE
(log(8.69447/12) = log(0.72454) = −0.13).
19
The Brazilian Bureau of Statistics website (http://www.ibge.gov.br) provides a description of
this classification as well as various matching tables to other classification schemes.

The enforcement information was also used by Almeida and Carneiro [2].

21

labor regulation compliance. We normalized the number of visits in each state and
sector by the number of persons employed in that state and sector provided by the
Brazilian Statistics Bureau (IBGE) (through the Cadastro Central de Empresas).21
Assuming that a firm’s suppliers were in the same state, we generated an index of
supplier formalization enforcement as a weighted average of these variables where the
weights were the sectoral input demand coefficients. We used sectoral output allocation coefficients to obtain an analogous measure of client formalization enforcement.
The correlation matrix for our variables is on Table 3.
[Tables 3 and 4 here]

4.3

Probability of Formalization

Table 5 contains probit estimates for the formalization variable taxreg using two
different sets of controls. The signs obtained for each one of the regressors are as
expected. The coefficient of the variable “working outside the home” is positive. In
agreement with the first model, the coefficients are also positive for variables related
to the size of the firm (number of employees and revenue), credit (bankloan), or the
quality of the entrepreneurial input (education, age or having no additional job).
Since women in Brazil are more likely to have substantial household duties, the sign
on the gender variable is probably related to entrepreneurial input. The coefficients
on all these variables are statistically significant.
[Table 5 here]
The two sets of estimates use different sectoral controls. In the first set we
used dummies for state and sector (according to the specification on Table 4). In
the second set of results we used the derived output coefficients obtained from the
Brazilian National Accounts (and equivalent results are obtained if one uses the input
coefficients). The National Accounts System in Brazil categorizes economic activity
into forty-two sectors. The “use table” in the NAS allows one to obtain how much in a
given year a sector required in terms of input from another sector in the economy. This
can be used to obtain the technical coefficients for each NAS sector (see footnote 15).
We were able to identify the sector (according to the NAS) for each firm in the
ECINF survey using equivalence tables among the different classification schemes that
are available from the Brazilian Statistics Bureau. The “make table” in the National
21

Similar calculations were also performed using as normalizing variable the number of firms in
the state-sector (also obtained through the Cadastro Central de Empresas).

22

Accounts provides the quantity of output destined to each sector of the economy (plus
final demand, which comprises inventory, family consumption, exports and public
administration). We used this information to assemble a vector of sectoral allocation
for each monetary unit of output generated for each activity in our sample (and hence
each observation in our sample): (oaj )j=1,...,42 . These controls, in additional to state
dummies, are used in the second set of estimates presented in the table.22

4.4

Investment, Installations per Worker and Profits

Since an entrepreneur’s true ability is not observable, it makes sense to measure the
effect of formalization after controlling for characteristics of the manager and the firm.
The model predicts that informal firms would choose a lower capital-labor ratio, and
Table 6 depicts the effect of formalization on investments and installations per worker.
The coefficient has the right sign and is statistically significant. Formalization has an
economic significance of 0.31 for investments per worker and 0.52 for installations per
worker regardless of the measure of formalization23 . In other words, formalization is
associated with an increase in investments (installations) per worker of 0.31 (0.52)
standard deviations.
[Table 6 here]
We also examined the correlation of formalization with profits. The results
are summarized in the same table. Again, after controlling for characteristics of the
manager and the firm, formalization has a statistically significantly positive association with profits. Formalization is associated with an increase in monthly profits of
approximately 700 Reais.24

4.5

Regression Regimes

In our regressions we used education as one of the measures of an entrepreneur’s
quality θ. Our model predicts a “gap” in the size distribution of firms as a function of
the quality of the entrepreneur. Our observable measure for entrepreneurial quality
input, education, is an integer between 1 and 8. Hence ln x ≥ 0 and Proposition 1
22

For each observation we can also assemble a vector of input requirements (tcj )j=1,...,42 and these
controls result in estimates similar to the ones presented using output coefficients.
23
For dummy variables, we define the economic significance as the regression coefficient divided
by the standard deviation of the dependent variable.
24
This figure is for October 2003, when 1 US dollar was worth 2.87 Reais.

23

guarantees that the interaction coefficient is positive (provided the model is a valid
description).
Table 7 exhibits OLS estimates of the number of employees on a series of
controls and using education of the owner as the observable productivity enhancing
feature. The coefficient of the interaction of education and formality is positive and
significant. The result persists when we control for the level of wages within the firm.
Since the number of employees is an integer, we also ran an ordered probit and a
Poisson25 regression, but the results are very similar.
[Table 7 here]

4.6

Cost of Capital

In the first model, the marginal product of capital of formal entrepreneurs is:
αy(1 − τ )
α × θ(1 − τ )lβ k α
=
.
k
k
The marginal product of capital for unconstrained informal entrepreneurs is:
αy
α × θlβ k α
=
k
k
These quantities should then equal the cost of capital: r̃f = δ + rf for formal
and r̃i = δ + ri for unconstrained informal entrepreneurs, where δ is the common rate
of depreciation. Since δ ≥ 0 rrfi ≥ r̃r̃fi , and hence an estimate of r̃r̃fi is a lower bound for
ri
. With the maintained assumption that α is the same for both formal and informal
rf
entrepreneurs, an estimator for r̃r̃fi would be:
yi /ki (for unconstrained informal firm)
.
(1 − τ )yf /kf (for formal firm)
In practice, neither output nor capital are perfectly measured in the survey
we use. Taking revenue (net of taxes) and the value of installations as imperfect
measures of output (net of taxes) and capital26 , we would nonetheless obtain:
revenue
y + y
=
installations
k + k
25

A Poisson regression models the dependence of a countable random variable Y on covariates X.
It postulates a Poisson distribution for Y with expectation exp(α + β 0 X).
26
Installations for example include facilities, tools, machines, furniture and vehicles, which may
themselves be reported with error, and exclude working capital and inventories.

24

where y and k stand for the measurement errors in output and capital, which we
assume are on average zero and uncorrelated with output and capital. Under these
assumptions, the average revenue and installation values converge in large samples to
the expected output and capital in the population. Conventional application of the

informal or formal entrepreneurs respectively. The estimator relies on the assumption
that the measurement error is averaged out across many randomly sampled individual
and is reminiscent of the strategy used by Milton Friedman in his classical study of
consumption.27
Assume now that one samples independently Nf formal entrepreneurs and Ni
unconstrained informal entrepreneurs and that Ni /Nf converges to a positive value c
as the sample size grows. An additional application of the usual asymptotic arguments
shows that the distribution of the ratio of revenue per installation for unconstrained
informal entrepreneurs and for formal entrepreneurs can be approximated in large
samples by

lower skill parameter θ. Since more able entrepreneurs will employ more capital and
more labor, we can use the number of workers as a sorting mechanism and focus on the
group of entrepreneurs employing lower amounts of labor. Using informal employers
with two or less workers leads to a point estimate of r̃r̃fi of 1.31 with a standard error
of 0.0178. Using informal employers with only one worker yield similar estimates.
Hence we estimate that, in our data set, informal firms face a rate of interest that is
at least 1.3 times the interest rate faced by formal firms.

4.7

Chain Effects on Formalization

One initial approach to investigate the existence of cross-industry effects of formalization is to employ a characterization of a firm’s clientele as presented in the ECINF
survey. Interviewees were asked to declare whether sales were principally to governmental institutions, large firms (more than five employees), small firms (five employees
or less) or persons. Sales to governmental institutions, large firms and small firms tend
to increase the probability of formalization with the largest effect being associated
with governmental organizations and the lowest with small enterprises as depicted on
Table 8. Since one can intuitively order these three categories according to formalization (with government being the most formal and large firms being more formal
than small ones), we read these correlations as suggestive that there is a chain effect
on formalization.
We also used a composite measure of formalization among a firm’s suppliers to examine the chain effect. This measure consists of a weighted average of the
formalization variable (taxreg) across supplying sectors using as weights the technical coefficients for input utilization from each sector. More precisely, the formality
measure for the suppliers of firm i is given by
P
supplierf ormali =

(37)

where formalityj is the percentage of firms in sector j that display tax registration28
and tcij is the required amount of input from sector j per monetary unit of output produced by firm i (obtained from the technical coefficients for that firm’s sector). This
measure of supplier’s formality only accounts for potential suppliers that are present

Four NAS sectors were excluded since they are not sampled in the ECINF survey: agriculture,
mineral extraction, the sugar industry and other food products.

in the survey and, in particular, ignores all suppliers that are large firms. Nevertheless, the results of our analysis again favor the model: the coefficients attached to this
variable are positive and statistically significant. The estimation results are displayed
on Table 8. The marginal impact of supplier formalization on the probability of being
formal is 0.365.
A similar strategy was adopted for the sales of each firm, where a sectors’
formalization is now weighted according to the output break up by sector obtainable
as well from the NAS:
P
j oaij × formalityj
P
(38)
clientf ormali =
j oaij
The results are depicted on Table 8. The coefficient on this composite measure of
client formalization is positive and statistically significant, with a marginal impact of
0.623.
[Table 8 here]
While the degree of tax compliance among a firm’s suppliers and customers
seems to affect formalization, an endogeneity problem may arise since suppliers and
customers of a firm respond to the degree of tax compliance of that firm. This
would tend to bias the estimator upwards. Nevertheless, since the variable we use as
a proxy for formalization among clients is an imperfect measure of tax compliance
an extra source of endogeneity arises due to measurement error. In this case, with
mismeasured categorical variables, one cannot rule out the possibility of attenuation
bias in the opposite direction of the simultaneity bias (see Bound et al. [3]). To
address this potential endogeneity problem we ran instrumental variable versions for
the estimation results displayed in Table 8 using the average education level in the
entrepreneurs urban sector as an instrument for the formalization of a firms clients.
Since we use a single instrumental variable (and hence can only handle one endogenous
variable), we consolidate the dummy variables indicating large firms, small firms and
governmental institutions as a single variable. Table 9 display the results for the first
set of estimates in Table 8 using the aggregate variable in place of largecl, smallcl
and govcl and its IV version. The coefficient on the consolidated variable, lsgecl,
is positive and remains so in the IV version. In fact, the IV version displays an even
larger coefficient, which we ascribe to the attenuation effects of measurement error in
the non-instrumented estimation.29

We have also run instrumented and non-instrumented probit regressions using a subsample of

The Effect of Enforcement

The previous results show evidence of correlation in the degree of informality across
stages of production. Our second model suggests that increased tolerance towards
informality in the upstream sector leads to a reduction in formalization in the downstream sector. Similarly, higher tolerance for informality among downstream firms is
accompanied by higher degree of tax avoidance in the upstream sector. We use the
measures of formalization enforcement in the labor market described in subsection 4.2
as an indicator for monitoring within each state-economic sector from which a firm
buys (using the technical coefficients as weights) and to which a firm sells (using the
output allocations as weights). Our estimates on Table 10 show that enforcement in
upstream or downstream sectors has a positive and significant effect on the probability
of formalization.

SIMPLES: São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul

In 1996 the Brazilian federal government established the SIMPLES tax program.
The program was targeted at small firms: those with roughly less than R$1,000,000
in annual revenues. It consolidated taxes and social security contributions in a single
payment and aimed at simplifying the verification and remittance procedures for tax
collection. Although states and municipalities were allowed to join the system for the
collection of value added taxes (ICMS and ISS ), very few did. More than 20 states
eventually established instead their own state-level versions of the SIMPLES system
for the collection of VAT and other state taxes. In 1998, the state of São Paulo
established a local version of the SIMPLES program. The system exempted firms
with less than R$ 120,000 annual revenues from the collection of the state VAT and
offered reduced rates to larger firms with at most R$1.2 million in annual revenues.
The program provided firms with a significant reduction in VAT. For example, a firm
selling R$60,000 in a month with input costs at R$20,000 would pay R$7,200 in VAT
before the SIMPLES. Under the new program, the VAT would amount to less than
R$1,300.
We use the first round of the ECINF survey, collected in 1997, and its 2003
edition to measure the effect of this reduction in VAT on formalization in the state of
firms having only large and small firm clients and using the latter as baseline. The coefficient for
the large client dummy is also positive in the non-instrumented version of this estimation and it also
increases when we use the instrumental variables.

28

São Paulo. For comparison we use the state of Rio Grande do Sul, which established
its state SIMPLES only by the end of 2005. Table 11 displays summary statistics on
some key variables in 1997 for these two states. With the exception of the number of
workers, the proportion of registered firms and whether the entrepreneur holds other
jobs, the means for the variables are not significantly different at the 10% level.
[Table 11 here]
Table 12 displays results from a probit model where dummy variables for the
state and pre- and post-introduction of the state SIMPLES are used to assess the
variation in the formalization in São Paulo. We apply the controls we used in the
previous formalization regressions.30 The results point to a positive impact of the program introduction with a marginal effect of 5.48 percentage points on formalization,
increasing the probability of formalization by approximately one-third.
[Table 12 here]

4.10

Robustness: Tax Substitution

Brazilian tax law imposes forward tax substitution (“substituição tributária para
frente”) in certain sectors.31 Under this tax collection system, the value added tax is
charged at the initial stage in the production chain at a rate estimated by the State.
This method tends to be adopted for activities with a reduced set of initial producers
and many smaller units at the subsequent stages of production. Since no extra value
added tax is imposed one should not expect a chain effect within these sectors.
We ran probit estimates on activities where tax substitution is imposed. These
activities (and their CNAE numerical activity designation) are automobile and autoparts manufacturing (34001, 34002, 35010, 35020, 35030, 35090), production of tires
(25010), production and distribution of liquor (15050 and 53030), cigarettes (16000),
commercialization of automobiles and tires (50010, 50020, 50030 and 54040), distribution of fuel (50050 and 53065), bars and similar establishments (55030) and oil
refining (23010 and 23020).
The results concerning investment and installations, number of employees,
and the entrepreneur’s education level remain qualitatively as before. In Table 13 we
interact tax-substitution with our measure of formality of the clients. To facilitate
30

Standard errors are not clustered by urban sector since their definition varied between 1997 and
2003.
31
Tax substitution is not peculiar to Brazil. See [18].

29

comparisons with the results in Table 9 we again consolidate the dummy variables
indicating large firms, small firms and governmental institutions as a single variable.
The coefficient of the interaction term is negative and significant and the p-value of the
hypothesis that the sum of the coefficients of this interaction term and the coefficient
on the aggregate measure of client formalization equals zero is .0636. Hence we fail to
reject at the 5% level the hypothesis that in the sectors with tax substitution there
is no chain effect.
Our model predict this decrease in the interaction effect but does not make
any prediction concerning the effect on the level of informality. The tax authorities
in Brazil impose tax substitution hoping to increase compliance. The firms in our
sample that belong to the tax substitution sectors tend to have more individuals
(as opposed to firms or government) as clients and to be owned by less educated
entrepreneurs, both factors associated with less formality. Nonetheless they tend to
be more formal than firms in the remaining sectors. In fact the difference in the rate
of formalization between firms in the tax substitution sectors and the other firms is
7.8 percentage points (with a standard error of .4), a very large effect when compared
with the average level of 13.2% in our sample. This probably reflects the criterium
used by the Brazilian tax authorities. Tax substitution is impose when at some level
in the chain the typical producer is a large firm. If these large firms cannot afford
to become informal it is likely that, through the chain effect, the smaller firms which
are suppliers and buyers will tend to become formal.
[Table 13 here]

Conclusion

We presented two models of informality. An implications of the first model is that informal firms are smaller, less productive and with less capital per worker. The second
model predicts that informality may be transmitted through vertical relationships
when value added taxes are levied through the credit method. Using microdata from
surveys conducted in Brazil, we confirmed implications of both models.

Appendix A: Proof of Proposition 1
The proof is by induction on the cardinality of supp(x). The notation supp denotes
the support of a given random variable. For a set A, #A is the cardinality of that
set. Recall that we assume that  ∼ G(·) is independent of x and supp() = R.
Step 1: (#supp(x) = 1) In this case, ln x is a constant and we can focus on:
EBLP [ln l| ln x, 1xe ≥θ . ln x; xe ≥ θ̂] = ϕ0 + ϕ1 1xe ≥θ
where ϕ0 = ξ0 + ξ1 ln x (so that ξ0 and ξ1 are not separately identifiable) and ϕ1 =
ξ2 ln x. We will show that ϕ1 > 0 and this in turn implies that sgn(ξ2 ) = sgn(ln x).
This being a best linear projection,
ϕ1 =

cov(ln l(xe ), 1xe ≥θ |xe ≥ θ̂)
var(1xe ≥θ

|xe

≥ θ̂)

⇒ sgn(ϕ1 ) = sgn(cov(ln l(xe ), 1xe ≥θ |xe ≥ θ̂))

where we stress the point that the equilibrium demand for labor l(xe ) is a function
of x and . Let  solve
xe = θ ⇔  = ln θ − ln x
and ˆ solve
xeˆ = θ̂ ⇔ ˆ = ln θ̂ − ln x
The covariance can then be written as
Z

cov(ln l, 1xe ≥θ |xe ≥ θ̂) =
ln l(xe ).1xe ≥θ dG(| ≥ ˆ)

where τ = 0 and r = ri if the entrepreneur is informal and τ > 0 and r = rf otherwise.
Remember that
l(θ, rf , τ ) > l
where l(θ, rf , τ ) is the optimal labor demand of a formal firm with skill parameter θ
and l is the labor demand for an informal firm with skill parameter l constrained to
employ at most k = k. This information is important because
xe ≥ θ(⇔  ≥ ) ⇒ ln l(xe ) > l(θ, rf , τ )
and
xe < θ(⇔  < ) ⇒ ln l(xe ) < ln l.
So the covariance should be
Z
G() − G(ˆ)
cov(ln l, 1xe ≥θ |xe ≥ θ̂) =
ln l(xe )dG(| ≥ ˆ)
1 − G(ˆ)



Step 2: (#supp(x) = n) Assume that supp(ln x) ⊂ R+ and that the assertion in the
proposition is valid for #supp(x) = n − 1.
Consider the following best linear projections:
ln l = α0 + α1 ln x + η
and
1xe ≥θ . ln x = β0 + β1 ln x + ν.
These being best linear projections,
η = ln l − E(ln l|xe ≥ θ̂) − α1 [ln x − E(ln x|xe ≥ θ̂)]
and
ν = 1xe ≥θ . ln x − E(1xe ≥θ . ln x|xe ≥ θ̂) − β1 [ln x − E(ln x|xe ≥ θ̂)]
where
α1 =

cov(ln l, ln x|xe ≥ θ̂)
var(ln x|xe ≥ θ̂)

and β1 =
32

cov(1xe ≥θ . ln x, ln x|xe ≥ θ̂)
var(ln x|xe ≥ θ̂)

.

The Frisch-Waugh-Lowell Theorem then allows us to state that
ξ2 =

cov(η, ν|xe ≥ θ̂)
var(ν|xe ≥ θ̂)

.

The covariance in the numerator will determine the sign of ξ2 . This can be seen to
be:
cov(ln l, 1xe ≥θ |xe ≥ θ̂). ln x − β1 cov(ln l, ln x|xe ≥ θ̂) =
cov(ln l, (1xe ≥θ − β1 ). ln x|xe ≥ θ̂).
Let x = max supp(x) and K = supp(x) − {x}. We can view x as a mixture
of two distributions: with probability P(x = x) we sample from a distribution that
delivers x with certainty and with complementary probability we sample from the
distribution of x conditional on the event {x ∈ K}. The first one has a support of
size one and the second, a support of size n − 1.
An analysis of variance argument yields
cov(ln l, 1xe ≥θ ln x|xe ≥ θ̂) = E{cov(ln l, 1xe ≥θ ln x|1K ; xe ≥ θ̂)|xe ≥ θ̂} +
cov(E(ln l|1K ), E(1xe ≥θ ln x|1K ; xe ≥ θ̂)|xe ≥ θ̂)
where 1K = 1 if the sample is taken from K and = 0, otherwise.
When 1K = 1, the conditional covariance cov(ln l, 1xe ≥θ ln x|1K = 1|xe ≥ θ̂) > 0 because ln x > 0 and #K = n − 1. Alternatively, for 1K = 0 the conditional covariance
cov(ln l, 1xe ≥θ ln x|1K = 0; xe ≥ θ̂) = cov(ln l, 1xe ≥θ ln x|xe ≥ θ̂) can be seen to be
positive using an argument akin to the one on Step 1 and the fact that ln x > 0. The
expectation of these conditional covariances is hence positive.
Notice as well that the E(ln l|1K = 0; xe ≥ θ̂) > E(ln l|1K = 1; xe ≥ θ̂) and
E(1xe ≥θ ln x|1K = 0; xe ≥ θ̂) > E(1xe ≥θ ln x|1K = 1; xe ≥ θ̂) since x > x, ∀x ∈ K
and both ln l and 1xe ≥θ ln x are increasing in x for every given . Consequently, the
covariance of the conditional expectations is positive. By induction, the result holds.

Appendix B: Non Degenerate Probability of Detection
We restrict ourselves to only one input: labor. In this model agents possess a degree of
entrepreneurial ability quantified by the parameter θ, which is distributed according
to a density function g. With an amount l of labor an entrepreneur can produce θlβ
units of output, paying a wage w for the labor input which is then taxed at a rate
λ − 1 (if formally established). In case the entrepreneur chooses to be informal, he or
she does not pay the tax but may be caught with a probability p(l), which we assume
to be a non-decreasing function of the number of employees a firm has. Once this
happens, profits are ceased by the authorities and set to zero. A person can choose
to be an entrepreneur in the formal or informal sectors or a worker.
The profit functions for formal and informal entrepreneurs are then given by:
Πi (l) = (1 − p(l)) × (θlβ − wl) and Πf (l) = θlβ − λwl
respectively.
Before proceeding we examine some conditions under which the maximization
problem is concave. For the formal entrepreneur, β < 1 is sufficient. With respect to
the informal manager, assume that p(·) is twice differentiable. Taking first derivatives
one gets
dΠi
(l) = −p0 (l) × (θlβ − wl) + (1 − p(l)) × (θβlβ−1 − w).
dl
Differentiating this expression, we achieve
d2 Πi
(l) = −p00 (l) × (θlβ − wl) − 2p0 (l) × (θβlβ−1 − w) + (1 − p(l))θβ(β − 1)lβ−2 .
dl2
For the sake of illustration, take p(l) = 1 − (1 + l)−γ . The parameter γ controls
how fast the probability of capture goes to one as the number of employees increases
as shown in Figure 2.
In a critical point,
dΠi
(l) = −γ(1 + l)−1 × (θlβ − wl) + (θβlβ−1 − w) = 0.
dl
The curvature of the function at this point is then given by
d2 Πi
(l) = γ(γ + 1)(1 + l)−γ−2 (θlβ − wl) − 2γ(1 + l)−γ−1 (θβlβ−1 − w) +
dl2
+(1 + l)−γ θβ(β − 1)lβ−2 ,
34

which we want to be negative. Using the expression for the first derivative and
simplifying terms, this requires that
(1 − γ)(1 + l)−1 (θβlβ−1 − w) + θβ(β − 1)lβ−2 ≤ 0.
Noticing that the second term is negative and θβlβ−1 − w, non-negative (from the
first-derivative expression), a sufficient condition is that
γ ≥ 1.
If, on the other hand, γ ≤ 1, we may rewrite this expression as
(1 − γ)(1 + l)−1 (θβlβ−1 − w) + θβ(β − 1)lβ−2 ≤

θβ[(β − γ)l + (β − 1)]
l2−β

and the term in the right is negative if γ ≤ β. So, a sufficient condition for the
program to be concave is that γ ≤ β. In other words, the probability of being
caught rises fast enough with the employment size. This is by no means necessary, as
γ = 0 would still constitute a concave problem though. Examining the expressions
above, one can see that, for reasonably small θs and/or large w the problem remains
concave. Figure 3 depicts the profit function for different levels of γ and a specific set
of parameters.
With a low enough probability of being caught it is intuitive that it pays for an
entrepreneur to become and informal manager. In order to make it disadvantageous
for higher ability entrepreneurs to become informal, the monitoring technology has
to become informative sufficiently fast as employment rises.
Formally, we would need that there exists an entrepreneur that prefers formality:
∃θ : Π∗f (θ) =

β β/(1−β) (1 − β β/(1−β) ) 1/(1−β)
θ
> (1 − p(l)) × (θlβ − wl),
β/(1−β)
(λw)

∀l

Here, the left hand side expression is the optimal profit in the formal sector for the
individual with ability θ. If we use 1 − p(l) = (1 + l)−γ , one observes that the above
condition is easier to satisfy as γ increases. So, the faster the monitoring system
improves with the number of employees, the more it favors formality.
