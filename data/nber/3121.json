These models usually reach the conclusion that while pure debt forgiveness is in the interest of debtor nations, debt repurchase programs are not. This paper introduces a \"safe sector\" into the debtor nation which is unexposed to seizure during default states. Two important results which emerge are that debt forgiveness is not necessarily in the interest of all debtors, and the potential for Pareto-improving debt-equity swaps is magnified.\n\n",
