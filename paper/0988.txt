                 Identification in Tax-Price Regression Models:
                         The Case of Charitable Giving

                                   Abstract



     Recent cross-section studies of the demand for charitable g~v~ng, owner
occupied housing, capital gains realizations, and the supply of labor hours have
been careful to use prices net of income tax levies. The use of after-tax
prices in a behavioral equation is a direct consequence of utility maximization
under a budget constraint and cannot be objected to. Nevertheless, when most or
all of the variance in prices comes from differences in marginal tax rates,
questions can arise about the identification of structural parameters. The
variables which deterMine marginal tax rates, chiefly income and marital status,
are quite plausible determinants of the behavior being modelled, in addition to
any indirect effect they might have through the tax price. A non-linear depen-
dence amonti the explanatory variables of a linear regression is not a source of
bias provided the linear specification is known to be correct. Because the
function form of a demand equation is not known a priori, this identification
through funct'ional form is not persuasive. In this note we propose an instru-
mental variable estimation designed to exploit any independent variation pres-
ent, and which allows unbiased estimates of tax-price elasticities under quite
general conditions. The estimator is applied to the demand for charitable
giving. The tax-price elasticity of the demand for charitable giving is esti-
mated to be -1.23.

occup~e                             rea 1"~zat"~ons,3 and the supply of labor hours

have been careful to use prices net of federal (and sometime"s state) incoille tax

levies.    The use of after-tax prices and wages in behavioral equations is a

direct consequence of utility maximization under a budget constraint and cannot

be objected to. 5 Nevertheless, when most or all of the variance in prices

across observations comes from differences in marginal tax rates, questions can

arise about the identification of structural parameters in the model.           It is not

the partial equilibrium nature of these regressions -- inevitable after all with

cross section data -- but the functional dependence among the explanator,y vari-

ables which causes the greatest discomfort.       The variables which determine

marginal tax rates, chiefly income and marital status, are quite plausible

determinants of the behavior being modelled, in addition to any indirect effect

they might have through the tax-price.       A non-linear dependence among the right-

hand side variables of a linear regression is not a source of bias provided the

linear specification is known to be the correct one.       Because the functional

form of a demand equation cannot be known a priori this identification through

functional form cannot be persuasive.
                                         6

     In particular, there will not    usual~    be aQY theoretical basis for

excluding polymonial and interaction terms in the included variables.           As more

of the plausible explanator,y variables are included, the tax price will approach

perfect colinearity with the remaining variables, yet if many are excluded, the

possibility that the tax price is     mere~   proxy for an improperly excluded expla-

nator,y variable increases.

     In this note we propose an instrumental variable estimator designed to

exploit sources of independent variation, which allows unbiased estimation of
                                         -2-


the tax-price elasticity under quite general conditions.       The estimator is

applied to the demand for charitable giving.      A charitable giving equation is an

appropriate test for this procedure because it represents the purest case of a

tax-price coefficient.     That is, taxes are the sole source of variance in the

price.     The deduction is also a non-trivial policy issue.    In 1977 1.4% of gross

income was deducted for this reason, about as much as the capital gains deduc-

tion.

        Since theory is not likely to govern the selection of   functiona~   forlli, the

situation is hopeless unless some independent variation among the right hand

side variables can be found and exploited. 7     Such variance is normally present in

tax-price regressions, and it arises from the complexity of the tax code.

Special provisions, including income averaging, the maximum tax on earned

income, the minimum tax on preferences, other deductions, disability income

exclusions, etc. all contribute to an apparently substantial departure of the

tax-price from perfect dependence on the included right hand side variable.

Nevertheless, these special provisions all relate to personal characteristics

some of which may have a direct effect on the desire or ability to give to

charity.

        We use the variation in tax law across the states as a source of variance

in the tax-price which is independent of personal characteristics, and therefore

not subject to the criticism outlined above.      'Ihe approach is made possible by

the recent (1981) release of individual level tax return files with state iden-

tifiers for most taxpayers,8 and Qy a program created by the National Bureau of

Economic Research for calculating state tax liabilities from individual data.

We do not merely replace tax prices based upon federal tax rates with a better

number based on federal and state rates.       The more comprehensive tax rate might

still be correlated with variables improperly excluded from the equation.
                                          -3-

Therefore, we propose a new approach using instrumental variables.          A suitable

instrument must be correlated with the tax price but uncorrelated with any per-

sonal characteristics of the taxpayers.         One   possible instrument would be the

subsiqy rate in the taxpayer's state of residence evaluated at some fixed level

of income and deductions.       The instrument used in Section V depends upon the

full distribution of income in the Tax Model sample.

    The correctness of our instrument depends on two assumptions:           first, that

state tax laws are inaependent of personal characteristics, and second, that

taxpayers react    siroilar~   to state and federal taxes.     The practicality of such

an estimator depends upon the partial correlation between the instrument and the
after-tax price.    The standard error of the estimated coefficient will increase

in proportion to the inverse of the square root of that correlation.           While this

qorrelation is bound to be weak -- state income taxes are         on~ ll~   of federal

income tax revenues in 1978 -- tax-price coefficients are often         extreme~

significant.

     Section II of this paper provides a brief sumwary of previous cross-section

estimates of the demand for charitable giving.          Section III is a derivation and

justification of the new instrumental variables estimator proposed in this

paper.   Section IV includes a description of the data but        ischief~    devoted to

the calculation of state income tax rates from federal tax return data.           The

estimated demand functions, using the traditional and the·new         s~ecifications     are

presented in Section V.

II.   The Demand for Charitable Giving


      In the United States, charitable donations of cash or assets are deductible

from gross income on the Federal tax return, at least for those taxpayers with

sufficient total deductions to justify itemizing their deductions.         (A standard

deduction is alloted to each taxpayer without substantiation.)        Similar rules

obtain under most state income tax laws.      Under a progressive income tax this

results in a substantial variance across      indivi~uals   in the after-tax price of a

dollar of charitable giving and opens the way for cross-section studies of the

demand for charitable giving.

      The seminal study in this area is Taussig (1967).       Using a stratified ran-

dom sample of U.S. tax returns, Taussig estimated a log linear equation for

charitable giving as a function of disposable income, the marginal tax rate, and

several demographic variables. 9   Separate linear rebressions were estimated for

each of five income classes.    Taussig's remains the only published study to find

no significant price effect, largely because later investigators have recognized
                                           lO
the simultaneity of income and tax rate.        Because the charitable giving

affects taxable income, and     is therefore at least a partial determinant of the

tax rate, the observed tax price is endogenous.      This problem is first

recognized by Feldstein and Taylor (1976) who substituted a so called "first

dollar tax rate", i.e. the tax rate that would have been obtained if the tax-

payer had no deductions for charitable giving.      Disposable income is subJect to
                                                                 ll
the same bias, which is corrected in the identical manner.

      Contributions of appreciated assets present an additional difficulty.        When

an asset is sold only a fraction of the appreciation is included in taxable

income, but if it is donated to charity the full market value is deductible from
                                           - 5 -

taxable income.      Suppose    m is the tax rate on ordinary income and          mc     is the

effective tax rate on realized capital gains.         Then the proceeds from the sale

of an asset with current value        V and basis    B will be      V-mc(V-B).     The reduc-

tion in tax liability if the asset is donated to charity is            mY.   The difference

in the proceeds to the taxpayer of the two dispositions of the asset, divided by

the value to the charity of the asset, is the unit price of the gift.                  That is,

Passet   =1   - mc(l-B/V) - m.     Although gifts of cash and assets are recorded se~ar­

ate~     on the tax form the ratio of basis to current value is not available.

     Feldstein and Taylor (1976) construct an unexpected price for each taxp~er

from a weighted average of the cash and asset prices at a constant value of B/V.

The weights are given by the shares of cash and asset gifts in the taxpayers

income class rather than the taxpayers own decision.             If this were not done the
                           l
tax price would again be endogenous.        Most givers of capital assets also give

cash, a behavior which is inexplicable under the assumption that the marginal

cost of asset      donatio~s   is less than that of other gifts.      Nevertheless, where

the data has been available subsequent studies have followed thi q lead.


       The resulting equation, estiwated on 1970 tax return data yields:

        In(G+IO)          1.933 - 1.285 1n(P) + .702 In(Y-T)                  =    .406
                         (.214)                (.024)                         =    13,770

                     +                 .419 AGE
                                      (.038 )


where     G is the deduction for charitable giving,        Y-T     is disposable income,          P

is the marginal tax-price of giving,         MAH   is a marital status dUIIlIlW and       AGE

equals one if at least one of the taxpayers is 65 or older.             Standard errors are
                                       - 6 -


shown in parentheses.    For this equation     B/V   is assumed to be     .5,    although
other values yield similar results.

     The price coefficient of -1.28 implies that each dollar of lost revenue

stimulates more than a dollar of charitable giving, i.e. that it is in SOllie

sense "efficient" to allow a deduction for giving.        The low income coefficient

implies that giving is an inferior good.

     Because giving is observed only for itemizers, taxpayers who take the stan-

dard deduction are typically excluded from the regression.            Since charitable

giving influences the decision to itemize, this rule induces some sample selec-

tion bias.    Clotfelter (1980) suggests including only those taxpayers who would

itemize for any level of giving.     The resulting selection, based as it is solely

on independent variables, does not introduce any bias if the model is otherwise

correct.

     Essentially all subsequent studies have adopted a constant elasticity.

specification, with only the minimal changes necessary to adapt it to the

available data.

     Because 95% of (unweighted) returns with itemized deductions show some

charitable giving, the potential    problel~   of a limited dependent variable are

avoided.     Reece (1979) worked with the Consumer Expenditure Survey.           The CES

includes data on giving for itemizers and non-itemizers' alike, and because the

CES sample is not dominated by high-income households it includes many non-

givers.    Reece uses a Tobit estimator appropriate to this situation and

generally confirms the earlier results.

     Detailed demographic, consumption and wealth data         fro~   the 1963 Survey of

Consumer Finance were used by Feldstein and Clotfelter (1976) but this did not

much affect the estilliated price elasticity of givinb    ,   which   rel~ined   at about

minus one in   essential~     all specifications.                  Clotfelter (1980) has a seven year

panel of tax returns.        A panel allows the estimation of separate permanent and

transitor,y income elasticities, a fixed effects model, and a -partial adjustment

model.    All of these equations show           considerab~             lower price elasticities (in

the range (-.3) - (-.5)) than did the ~nnual models.                         Nevertheless, the signifi-

cance of the price coefficient is established in all studies since the first.




III. An IV Estimator

     We assume a true model of the form


                     g   =    [y,p,w)      (y.~). .+. .11




                                                  .,               12
where    g   is charitable giving,         y      ~s    ~ncome,          p   is the tax-price and w is

some (possibly random) function of               y.         The tax-price has a deterministic part

non-linearly dependent on          y    and a random part independent of such personal

characteristics.     All three variables are measured as deviations from means.                        A
general nonlinear form for the regression would be much more difficult.                         This

specification restricts        p       to enter    linear~         without restricting the form in

which any other explanator,y variable may enter. 13


         In the absence of any knowledge of                   w,   the siwplified regression


                     g   =    [y,p)      (~)+e

has been estimated.      Following the standard demonstration of omitted variable

bias yields:
                                                   - 8 -




where     0   is the vector of coefficients from a regression of                     w on   y   and       p.

That is,      ~     is biased to the extent that the price of charitable giving is

correlated with an important omitted variable.                  The direction of bias

is unknown.
              ,..
        Let   Pi    be the mean tax price of giving, over a fixed set of taxpayers

subject to the laws of the state of residence for taxpayer                      i.    Therefore   p.  ~


takes on one of several values depending upon the tax laws at the residence of

the taxpayer but independent of his own income.                  Nevertheless, it is correlated

with his own tax-price, and therefore may serve as an instrumental variable.

        The standard instrumental variable estilJJ8.tor is:



                          (~)=       ([y,PJ'[y,p])-l [y,PJ'g



        Substituting for g and noting that II is uncorrelated with the other

variables:

     By hypothesis plim (yIp) and plim (p'w) are zero, therefore:




                                          A·

     and plim    a = a itself,    while a'remains biased

     It is usual to suppose that specification error of this kind will affect

all of the estimated    coefficient~ adverse~:                That it does not in this case is

due to the hypothesized orthogonality of pto y and w.

     Notice that the instrument is not the average price of giving in each

state.   That depends upon the distribution of income in each state as well as

the state law.     Since states are known to have different levels of income (and

therefore quite different average federal tax rates) this would not be indepen-

dent of the other explanatory variable.              Of course, if states vary in income, it
                                       - 10 -



is possible that they vary systematically in their residents' taste for chari-

table giving.   Examination of this possibility is beyond the scope of this

paper, but it should be noted that this limited independence assuwption is also

inherent in the traditional OLS tax-price regression.



IV.   State Income Taxes


      Out of 51 states (including the District of Columbia), a total of 46 levied

some form of personal income tax in 1977.       Only Nebraska's simple excise tax on

federal liabilities was completely dependent upon the federal definitions of

income and deductions.     The remaining 45 states all exercised at least nominal

independence from the federal definition of taxable income, and of course the

bracket rates are quite independent of any coordination.       A number of long con-

sidered changes in the federal law are alreaqy in place in some state tax codes,

including inflation indexing, optional separate filing for married couples,

vanishing exemptions, full taxation (or complete exemption) of realized       capit~l

gains, and complete elimination of personal deductions.       Although smaller in

magnitude than the federal leyy marginal tax rates are definitely non-trivial,

ranging up to 14% in New York and over 10% in seven other states.

      In 33 states charitable giving is deductible from taxable     inco~e,   providing

a direct tax subsidy smaller in magnitude than the federal incentive but iden-

tical in form is provided for such gifts.       state subsidy rates are shown in

Table 1 for several income levels.     The taxpayer is assumed to be filing jointly

with federal itemized deductions of $3,200 or 24 percent of income (whichever is

larger).   The entries show the dollar reduction in state tax liability associ-

ated with a $100 increase in giving.     The indirect effect of the change in

federal liability on state taxes is included where relevant.    In Minnesota, for

example, federal taxes are deductible from state taxable income, this results in

a surprising decrease in tax rates at higher incomes.     Because the IV estimator

uses for variance across states rather than across income classes, the variety

of subsidy rates is gratifying.   Eight states have rates above 10% for at least

some taxpayers, while 18 have zero rates for all residents.

     With the partial exception of Feldstein and Taylor (1976) previous studies

have neglected the role of state taxes in charitable giving.     Notice that both

the price of giving and disposable income are affected.     Feldstein and Taylor

considered only the first; furthermore, the calculation of the marginal rate was
crude by comparison with the detailed iraplementat'ion of the federal law.   The

effect of either omission on the estimated coefficients is ambiguous because the

correlation between state and federal tax rates (which would bias the coef-

ficients away from zero) might overwhelm the pure errors-in-variable tendency to

depress coefficients.

     As part of NBER's general program in state and local taxation we have pre-

pared Fortran programs for calculating state tax liabilities from federal Form

1040 data, as available to us.    In spite of the diversity of state laws, the

information on the 1040 is sufficient to model the state laws quite closely.

While the tax treatment of individual items may vary across states, in most

cases the definitions are those of the federal law.   'PresUmab~   this stems more

from a desire to lean on IRS auditing and document matching than on a universal

belief in the correctness of those definitions.    In any case, most deviations

from the federal definitions occur in calculated quantities rather than the

basic data.   For example, state income taxes are deductible on the federal
                                          - 13 -


return but not on most      state tax returns.     Nevertheless the state income tax

deduction is a separate line on the 1040 and this makes possible an accurate

calculation of the state itemized deductions.           The major exception to this rule

is the treatment of interest on government debt.           Interest on state and local

debt is not taxed by the federal government and is not shown on the 1040.

Treasury debt is not taxed by the states, but neither is it broken out on the

federal return.     Since   essential~   nothing is known about the distribution of

holdings of these debts no attempt was made to adjust for this discrepancy.

     Deductions and credits for local property taxes are a feature of many state

income tax laws; this presents no problem.         Some states extend these provisions

to renters, usually by iwputing some fraction of rent to property taxes.               (The

fraction is independent of the local tax rate, however!)            Although rent payments

could easily be imputed to     taxp~ers    based   o~   their income, this has not yet

been implemented.

     The state of residence code is taken from the address field of the tax

return and is also subject to error.        Taxpayers may move, or work in another

state (and be subject to that tax law) or might give the address of a bank or

attorney in another state.

     The accuracy of the federal tax calculation is           readi~   checked by   co~


parison with the tax liability reported by the taxpayer.            These match     precise~


with a few exceptions.       The itemized deduction for state "income taxes is not a

usable check on the state tax liability, because it records cash payments rather

than accrued liabilities.       That is, it records this years withholding plus net

underwithholding for the previous year.        Aggregate estimates (by state) of

liability from the    1977 calendar year Tax Model data and the TAXSIM program for
                                                        - 14 -



each state may be compared to reported aggregate revenues for fiscal year 1978

(Tax Foundation, 1979) to get a rough idea of the accuracy of the calculation.

In 25 of      44 states the difference between revenues and estimated liability
exceeded one standard error of estimate and 12 exceeded two such intervals.

The Tax Foundation has been kind enough to supply worksheets showing the calcu-

lation of. state income taxes in ever,y state for 8 hypothetical individuals.

Aside from the problems mentioned above, these figures match those from TAXSIM.

     The reciprocal deductibility of state and federal taxes on federal and

state tax returns does not create true simultaneity because the federal deduc-

tion is based on taxes paid rather than tax liability incurred.                      Nevertheless it

seemed natural to include the effect on future tax liabilities in the current

price of giving.          In states that allow a deduction for federal taxes there is a

series of consequences of each tax on the other continuing until the                      taxp~er


takes the optional standard deduction.                      The talX-price model adopted here is:


     p        =              =   l-(t
                                        s
                                            + t
                                                  f
                                                      - at t )
                                                          s f

where    t,       s,   and   f   subscripts indicate total, state and federal marginal

rates and         a    equals one or two as the state denies or allows a deduction for

federal taxes.          The state and federal rates are each composed from separate

rates for cash and assets according to the procedure in Section II.                       This cuts

off the series after one go-round, ignores the possibility of discounting future

tax reductions, and presumes that this year's federal tax rate is a good                      pro~


for next year's rate. 14

        The average tax rates in each state, for a fixed distribution of income and

deduction amounts, are calculated from a single random subset of 383 taxpayers
                                          -15 -

from the main Tax Model file.      Separate tax rates for gifts of cash and assets

are calculated.     They enter as instruments separately.




v.   Results


        Our basic dataset is a one in ten subsample of the 1977 file. The original

file is censored to maintain the confidentiality of possibly recognizable

returns and excludes taxpayers with adjusted gross income of more than $200,000.

The regression sample is further restricted by the exclusion of taxpayers whose

non-charitable deductions are less than the standard deduction, and b,y the eli-

mination of a handful of     taxp~ers   with non-positive disposable income.

        An OLS regression on the new dataset using the conventional specification
previously dominant in the literature yields the estimated equation:



             In(G+10)   =   -2.83 + .78 In(Y-T) - .79 In(P)
                             ( .43) (.04)        (.12)

                                  +    .55 MAR + .47 AGE                =      .19
                                      (.06)     (.06)                   =      7102



        Restricting the model   to a sample of married couples less than 65 years

old yields equation (2):


             In(G+10)   =         +    .85 In(Y-T) - .56 In(P)
                                      (.05)         (.13)           =   .17
                                                                    =   5866


     These price elasticities are substantially less than those reported by

Feldstein and Taylor or Clotfelter for similar data and an identical specifica-

tion.     If (1) is modified to include only federal taxes, there is a slight chan5e

tion of records from the National Tax Model with adJusted gross income exceedinb

$200,000 (without state tax rates) has similarly little effect on the point

estimates.    It does, however, improve the fit and standard errors to figures

close to those .reported before.

     It is not possible to defeat the price effect by the simple addition of

interaction terms and squares (of the continuous variables).                                That exercise

yields the equation:


     (3)     In(G+10)   =       15.2 -        2.8 n(Y-T)
                                (1.85)        (.36)

                            +       .175 (In(Y_T))2            +         .338 In(Y-T) In(P)

                                 4.26 1n(P)       +     .072 (In(P) )2
                                (1.43)                ( .33)
                            +      .52 1n(P)·MAR           -     .589 In(P)·AGI!:
                                  (.35)                        ( .36)

which implies a price elasticity of -1.15 (significant at the 5% level).                                Adding

a proxy for wealth (25 times dividend income plus 12 times interest income) to

equation (1) does have a dramatic effect, however:


      (4 )   1n(G+10)   =       2.67 + .727 1n(Y..lT)                   +     .081 1n(W)

Although price remains significant the point estimate is now much smaller than

aQY reported since Taussig.

     The instrumental variable equivalent to (1) using as instruments the state

tax rates shown in Table 2, is given in equation (5).


           In(G+10)   =   -.77      +         .526 In(Y-T)              1.59 In(P)
                          (1.28)            ( .14)                      ( .44)

                      +     .65 MAR           +     .42 AGE                                   =   .19
                           (.08)                  ( .07)



     For the married, less than 65 subset the IV estiwate is:


     (6)   In(G+10)   =    -.494 + .56 In(Y-T)                          1.63 In(P)
                          (1.28)             ( .14)                     ( .46)                =   .16


    The expected loss of efficiency has more than tripled the standard error on

the price coefficient, however the resulting point estimate is significantly

different from zero and not significantly different from one.                           The IV estimates

therefore provide rough confirmation of the importance of the tax-price in

determining charitable giving.

     The wealth proxy almost eliminates the price coefficient in the 018

equation, but in the equivalent IV equation:


           In(G+10)   =    -.309        +     .436 In( Y-T )        +     .0859 In(W)
                          (1.1)              ( .14)                      (.005)

                           1.23 In(P)             +    .614 t<1AR
                           ( .42)                     (.08)

                      +     .193 AGE
                           (.07)
                                                                                         R2   =   .21
the point estimate is still quite respectable.                          Here is the equation for the

married and less than 65 years old subset:
                                          -18 -

      (8 )   In(G+IO)   =     .17 + .45 In(Y-T)   +    .08 InW
                            (1.24)  ( .14)            (.006)
                                                                            2
                            1.24 In(P)                                    R      =   .19
                            (.46)



      Life-cycle considerations suggest that the wealth          pro~   cannot be

arbitrarily excluded so equation (4) casts some doubt on the importance of

income tax deductability on charitable giving.        The IV estimate shows that this

impotence is an artifact of the correlation between the wealth proxy and the

tax-price.



VI.   Conclusion


      Our estimate of 1.23 (for equation (7»      as the price elasticity of chari-

table giving is not significantly different from earlier estimates based on tax

return data.     Because the IV estimator is robust to     ma~    specification errors,

including the incorrect choice of functional form or the exclusion of variables

affecting tax liability, this result strengthens the belief that taxes are an

important determinant of charitable giving in the United States.

      This is an expensive procedure, both in time and in statistical efficiency,

and in the absence of any evidence for bias in the traditional specification the

argument for the general adoption of this technique is weakened.                Nor does the

result imply    a~thing     for tax-price models of labor supply, capital gains reali-

zations, or housing tenure choice.       Nevertheless, it represents useful confir-

mation of a technique -- the tax-price       re~ression     which has proven extremely

valuable in a broad range of public finance issues.

 5.   Rosen (1976) tests and strong~ rejects the use of pre-tax wage rates in a
      labor supply equation when post-tax wage rates are known.

 6.   A similar issue affects the interpretation of regressions corrected for
      sample selection bias through the inclusion of a predicted hazard rate
      among the independent variables (Hechman 1980). The predicted hazard rate
      is a function of the remaining independent variables, and its effectiveness
      as a correction for sample selection bias is based on the a priori assump-
      tion that nonlinear terJllS in the independent variable could safe~ have
      been excluded from the uncensored model.

 7.   The remedy is not simply to adopt a more general functional form. The tax
      price coefficient may be robbed of its significance if a sufficiently
      general functional form is chosen including all relevant variables, but
      such an exercise does not begin to answer the question of which variables
      belong in the equation and which are mere~ colinear with them.

8.    These files are prepared annually qy the Internal Revenue Service (1977)
      for static simulations of the revenue effects of changes in the tax law.
      The stratification overrepresents small states and large incomes to achieve
      this end economically. Essential~ everything on the Form 1040 (the basic
      tax form) is included, together with a few iteQ5 from each of several sup-
      porting schedules. Sample size has ranged from 140,000 to 160,000 returns.
      These files are available to aqyone for a nominal fee from the National
      Archives.

 9.   Tax return data are as poor in demographic information as they are rich in
      income information. The number of dependent children, marital status, and
      the number of taxpayers (one or two) who are 65 years of age or older are
      the on~ items available. Age, race and sex are available in a special
      1972 match with Social Security records. This file does not include fami-
      lies with income over $100,000 and it has not, to ~ knowledge been used in
      any charity study.

10.   Taussig worked with an incomplete version of Tax r-bdel, and this may have
      played a seconda~ role in the negative findin6.

11.   To be strictly correct these first dollar rates should have been used as
      instruments ·for the endogenous rates rather than as substitutes. If, as
      might be expected, the first dollar rates have less variance than the
      actual rate, then the tax price coefficient is biased up.

13.   White (1982) discusses the possibility of approximating an unknown non-
      linear regression function by a linear regression on a Taylor expansion,
      but he is not encouragine;.

14.   It might be a very bad proxy if the   taxp~er   failed to i te.uli.ze the
      following year.
