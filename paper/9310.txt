Who Goes to College? Differential Enrollment by Race and Family Background

JEL No. I2, J0
ABSTRACT
While trends in college enrollment for blacks and whites have been the subject of study for a number
of years, little attention has been paid to the variation in college enrollment by socioeconomic status
(SES). It is well documented that, controlling for family background, blacks are more likely to enroll in
college than whites. This relationship is somewhat deceptive, however. Upon closer examination, we find
that blacks are more likely to enroll in college than their white counterparts only among low-SES
individuals. Among high SES individuals, this pattern is reversed. We also find that this relationship is
strongest in the 1970s and appears to disappear over time; by the 1990s, blacks are no more likely to
attend college than whites at any end of the SES distribution. This paper first documents this phenomenon
and then attempts to understand what is driving these differences across the distribution of family
background characteristics and why the relationship is changing over time. Although they have a
significant impact on college enrollment behavior, tuition costs and local labor markets explain very little
of racial differences in college entry. We do uncover different responses to tuition and labor markets by
individuals from different ends of the SES distribution, an important consideration for policies targeted
at improving college enrollment for low-SES individuals.

I. Introduction
The distinct pattern of college enrollment for blacks in the last three decades has been an
important topic of study, with recent evidence suggesting family background and tuition costs as
explanations. In the process, a number of researchers have documented the rather surprising fact that in
the 1970s and early 1980s, controlling for family background characteristics, blacks were more likely to
attend college than equivalent whites.1 While a number of papers have examined differing racial
enrollment patterns and uncovered this result, very little work has focused on the result itself. To date,
this finding remains largely a puzzle.
Upon closer examination, one uncovers the startling observation that blacks at the low end of
the family background spectrum are driving this result. That is, low socio-economic status (SES) blacks
are more likely than their white counterparts to attend college. At the same time, this story flips at the
high end of the SES spectrum; high status blacks are less likely to attend college than equivalent whites.
This relationship is strongest in the 1970s and early 1980s and dissipates over time.
The idea that low-SES blacks are more likely than their white counterparts to attend college
runs counter to many preconceptions that low-income blacks exhibit the worst labor market
performance and educational attainment relative to other groups. Anecdotal evidence often suggests
that when blacks exhibit better education, employment, or earnings performance, it is only the already
well off that reap the lions share of benefits. Indeed, these views are supported if one looks at other
outcomes; Bound and Freeman (1992), among others, document the erosion of relative earnings and

(1995).

employment among blacks in the 1980s, noting that the wages of low-educated workers fell but the
wages of low-educated black workers fell by more than the wages of their white counterparts. In
college enrollment, however, our findings prove false many prior beliefs about racial differences in postsecondary education. During the 1970s and 1980s, out of all groups of blacks, those blacks at the low
end of the SES distribution, regardless of how SES is measured, exhibit the strongest college enrollment
behavior relative to their white counterparts.
We then turn to possible explanations for this pattern. What becomes clear is that patterns of
college enrollment differ not only across races, but also across individuals with different family
background characteristics. We focus primarily on the role of college costs and the idea that not only
do blacks and whites face different labor markets, but that individuals from different family backgrounds
respond differently to their local conditions. We conclude that individuals do respond to differences in
college costs and that increases in college tuition have disproportionately affected blacks at the low end
of the SES distribution. However, these differential responses explain little of the total variation in
college enrollment rates between blacks and whites. Despite this, these findings provide insight into
appropriate policies to increase college attendance among the less advantaged.
This paper unfolds as follows. Section II frames the problem we are addressing. Section III
describes our data. Section IV establishes the basic patterns in black-white college-entry behavior,
while Section V investigates the determinants of college entry using more rigorous tools. Section VI
concludes.

II. Previous Literature on Black-White College Enrollment
4

Black college enrollment has followed an interesting path since the early 1970s (Figure 1). In
the late 1970s, black college enrollment increased dramatically, approaching the enrollment rate of
whites. In the early 1980s, however, there was a severe drop off. Since that time, black and white
college entrance rates have diverged, with blacks falling farther behind.
Both Kane (1994) and Hauser (1993) study the time-series patterns of college enrollment in the
CPS.2 They find that parental family background is the most significant factor in explaining both the
time-series and cross-sectional differences in the data. They assign a secondary role to college tuition,
Federal subsidies to college-attenders (the most well-known of which is the Pell Grant program), and
labor market variables. The importance of family background has also been documented in a number of
other important studies. Fuller, Manski and Wise (1982) and Cameron and Heckman (1998,2001) are
examples of this work. Like Kane (1994) and Hauser (1993), Cameron and Heckman (2001) analyze
black-white differences in college entry (the latter two papers also look at Hispanic-white differences).
On the cross-sectional front, Rivkin (1995) documents that, in the High School and Beyond
Class of 1982, blacks are more likely to attend college than whites with similar math and verbal test
scores. He finds that fewer job opportunities for blacks offer a partial explanation, where local labor
market conditions are calculated separately by race and gender.
Our study makes three contributions to this literature. First, we establish not only that blacks
and whites exhibit college-entry behavior that is different and statistically distinct but also that looking at

2

Kane (1994), has tried to explain this trend by focusing on college costs and family background. He
finds that the rising cost of college during the 1980s discouraged black college entry, whereas the gains
in parental education encouraged black college entry. The net effect is the decline and recovery
observed in the 1980s.

mean predicted differences between whites and blacks--as do Kane (1994), Hauser (1992), Rivkin
(1995), and Cameron and Heckman (2001)Bfails to reveal important differences in college entry
behavior between blacks and whites across the socio-economic spectrum. We also examine how this
relationship has changed over time. Second, we conclude that the effects of college tuitionBdespite its
dramatic real increase throughout the 1980s and early 1990sBcan account for very little of the blackwhite gap in college entry. Finally, we find evidence that suggests that individuals from different family
background respond differently to local labor markets and tuition; as a result, policies that target lessadvantaged youth, both black and white, for college attendance must incorporate these different
responses.

III. Data
Because we are focusing on both the cross-section and time-series patterns of black and white
college entry for men and women, a large data set that provides consistent measures of college going
behavior over time is needed. As a result, our primary data source is the March supplement to the
Current Population Survey (CPS) from 1968 through 1998. Because this is a household-based
dataset, we are able to match 18 and 19 year olds to their parents as long as they are considered
members of the same household. While this may sound restrictive, individuals are considered members
of their parent’s household as long as they either live in their parents= household or live in group quarters
away from the household. Therefore, children who are at school living in group quarters are treated as if

6

they were members of their parent’s households.3 As a result, we are able to match 74% of 18 and 19
year olds to their parent’s household and personal characteristics.4
Previous work on college entry employs the October supplement to the CPS. We believe that
the use of the March supplement is an improvement for two reasons. First, the family intra-relationship
variable in the October supplement is virtually non-existent prior to 1984. While one can determine if a
household member is a head, spouse, or dependent, it is impossible to ascertain if a dependent is a
family member. It is therefore impossible to determine if a member is a child of the household head.5
Second, the background measures in the October supplement, especially income measures, pale in
comparison to the March supplement in both quantity and quality (Hauser 1993).
One disadvantage of the March supplement is the absence of an indicator stating if a person
received a high school diploma. While the October supplement contains the variable explicitly, the
March supplement only reports a person=s highest grade attained. For our purposes, therefore, we treat
a person who completed the 12th grade as a high school graduate. Regardless of the differences in the
data sets, our results are robust across both the March and October supplements.

3

Hauser (1993) and Kane (1994) use CPS data from the October supplement and make similar
assumptions in order to match 18 and 19 year olds with parental and household characteristics.
Cameron and Heckman (2001) note the limitations of this sample selection.
4
Other 18 and 19 year olds are household heads or spouses of a household head (11.7%), other family
members of a household (6.3%) or non-family members of a household (8.3%). By focusing on 18 and
19 year olds, we are not allowing for the possibility that blacks may attend college later than whites.
While we cannot test this directly (because of our inability to get family background characteristics for
25 year olds in the CPS), we do look at overall black-white college enrollment patterns for 25 year olds
overall and find that they are similar to those of 18/19 year olds.
5
In fact, a dependent may very well be a sibling or parent of the household head if age distinctions are
not carefully noted. In the March CPS, almost 15% of dependents are not the household head=s
children, which suggests that assigning them as such in the October CPS could affect results.
7

In this paper, we are examining the college enrollment decisions of 18 and 19 year olds who
have completed high school.6 Similar to Kane (1994), an individual is considered as enrolled in college
if the highest grade attended, prior to 1993, is 13 or higher. As of 1993, individuals are considered
enrolled in college if they indicate that they have completed Asome college@ or if they indicate that they
are currently enrolled in college.7
Table 1 presents summary statistics of our sample. Whites are more likely to go to college on
average, have higher family income, and have more highly educated mothers. Blacks are more likely to
be living in a female-headed household with the mother on welfare. They are also more likely to be
living in a central city and in the south.8

IV. Black versus White College Enrollment: The Facts
The trend in college enrollment for blacks and whites (Figure 1) is striking. Even more striking is
this trend when one controls for family background; examining aggregate trends in college enrollment
fails to capture important variation by family background. (Table 2) When we break college enrollment
down by this SES and compare blacks to whites, we see that, at low ends of the SES spectrum, blacks
are actually more likely to attend college than comparable whites. As we move up the SES spectrum,
6

We focus on enrollment rates for individuals who completed high school. The CPS does not
consistently distinguish high school equivalency completers from traditional high school graduates, so we
refer to both groups as Ahigh school completers.@ Most high school equivalency degrees granted in the
U.S. are GED degrees, which require no classroom training to obtain. See Cameron and Heckman
(1993) for more details.
7
We compare our results using the March supplement to the same analysis using the October
supplement; in the October supplement, this break occurs at 1983 instead of 1992.
8
We do not analyze Hispanic college-entry in this paper due to sample size limitations and the changing
8

this relationship twists and, at the top, we can see that blacks are less likely to attend college than their
white counterparts.
Table 2 breaks our sample into 3 periods and presents the average black and white college
enrollment rates for all 18-19 year old high school graduates.9 The first three rows are at the heart of
much of the previous literature. We then break the sample even further into SES groups and present the
average rate of college enrollment across the SES distribution. Individuals were assigned an SES group
based on an initial regression using the pooled sample by year relating college enrollment to family
background characteristics10. Individuals were then ranked based on their predicted values from this
regression; the sample was divided into those in the bottom 20% of the distribution, the middle 60%,
and those in the top 20%. Table 2 shows that, in the earliest 2 periods, low SES blacks were more
likely to attend college than low SES whites; among the middle and high SES groups, college enrollment
is relatively equal for blacks and whites. However, in the latest period, the relationship flattens out and
blacks are less likely to attend college at all points along the SES spectrum. Table 3 shows the
relationship between family background and college enrollment broken out for men and women; again,
we see that the patterns hold for both men and women. As a result, in the remainder of the paper we
analyze men and women together when studying differences between black and white college

composition of U.S. Hispanics.
9
The data are broken into 3 periods for ease of exposition; results are similar when broken down into
shorter periods.
10
The index we use to represent SES is, in fact, a measure of the individual’s propensity to attend
college. This propensity appears to coincide with what we consider to be measures of family
background: individuals with lower family incomes and poorer educated parents are less likely to attend
college. The probit based on the college enrollment decision merely provides a set of weights for the
creation of an index. While these weights are somewhat arbitrary, the results are relatively insensitive to
9

enrollment.
Table 4 reveals the same pattern in a regression framework.11 College enrollment is regressed on a
number of family characteristics, including mother's education, father's education, welfare status, single
parent family indicator, family income (log form), income squared, family size (log form), a sex
indicator, center city and rural indicators, and dummies for region of the country. In addition, data is
divided into 3 periods (1973-78, 1979-89, 1990-1998), which are included as dummies and interacted
with an indicator equal to one if the individual is black. Column 1 presents these results. Consistent
with the earlier literature, we see that blacks in the earliest period are more likely to enroll in college
once one controls for family background. This effect dissipates over time, until, in the latest period,
blacks are less likely to enroll in college, controlling for family background.
The impact of the family background variables on college enrollment is quite consistent with
expectations. Better educated parents are associated with a higher probability of the child attending
college. Controlling for parents education, family income appears to have a negative impact on college
enrollment; this may be due to the idea that a “more successful” (i.e. higher income) less educated
parent may suggest to a child that there is no need for education, as is the case with a “less successful”
(i.e. lower income) well-educated parent. Finally, consistent with the literature, we find that men are
less likely to attend college than women, ceteris paribus (See Anderson, 2001.)
Column 2 then presents the results when the black dummy in each period is interacted with dummies
indicating low SES, middle SES, or high SES family backgrounds. Importantly, we see that it is blacks

our choice of SES measure.
11 All standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the state level.
10

from low SES backgrounds who are more likely to attend college than their white counterparts; this
effect dissipates as one moves up the SES distribution. It is also interesting to note that this impact is
strongest in the earliest period; by the middle period the effect is somewhat reduced and it has
disappeared by the last period.
It is not surprising that we find that blacks are more likely to attend college at some points during the
last 30 years; this finding is consistent throughout the literature. The interesting feature is that low-SES
blacks, and not high-SES blacks, are doing better than equivalent whites and thus driving this result.
Again, this finding runs counter to the notion that blacks who achieve gains in education attainment tend
to be those from high SES backgrounds. Evidence from the 1970s and 1980s directly contradicts the
“cream-skimming” argument that well-off blacks are enjoying the benefits of improved education
attainment relative to whites.

IV. Explanations
Data sample selection
One possible explanation is that these relationships are merely an artifact of our data selection
criterion; we are selecting only those 18 and 19 year-olds who are still dependents of their parents and
who also completed high school. We confirm our overall findings with the use of both the October
CPS and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), which suggests that sample selection is
not driving our results. In addition, as we noted previously, we are able to match over 70% of
individuals to their parents in our sample.
If we delve deeper, we find other reasons to suggest that sample selection is not the primary
11

explanation of our findings. We test this hypothesis by comparing individuals who we are able to match
to their parents at age 18 and 19 to individuals we are able to match to their parents at age 15 or 16
three years prior. At age 15 or 16, the fraction of children who are not part of their parent’s household
is much smaller; as a result, we are able to look at the family background characteristics of these
younger individuals and compare them to our matched sample three years later. In order to explain the
relationships that we observe in the cross-section, it would need to be the case that we are somehow
selecting better blacks (or relatively worse whites).
From Appendix Table 1 we can see that individuals in our sample are slightly better than the
family background of 15 and 16 year olds three years earlier (this is consistent with the fact that, at age
18 or 19, individuals who have already formed their own household are more likely to come from less
advantaged family backgrounds). However, this is relatively consistent for both blacks and whites. In
fact, it does not appear that there is much selection of our sample, as the means of the family
background variables are relatively similar among the 18/19 year olds and the 15/16 year olds three
years earlier.
A second concern is that the pattern we observe may be driven by our decision to focus on high
school graduates only. However, restricting our sample to high school graduates does not affect our
results; we see the same relationship when we consider college enrollment rates relative to the whole
population of 18 and 19 year olds. (See Appendix Table 2.) In addition, when we look at the
probability of high school graduation by family background characteristics, we see a similar, although
much weaker, relationship, suggesting the using the whole population as a control group would only
reinforce our findings.
12

Mis-Measurement of Family Background
When examining the trends in black college enrollment over time, Kane (1994) noted that one
part of the story is the improvement in family background characteristics of blacks over this time period.
Indeed, the trend is striking; as Figure 3 shows, there have been remarkable improvements in mothers’
education--a particularly good predictor of college enrollment--for blacks over this time period. This
trend is especially notable among less than high school and high school educated mothers and less
pronounced (relative to whites) among more educated women. In much of our analysis we are explicitly
controlling for family background characteristics. While these changes are obviously part of the story in
explaining what is happening over time, it cannot explain the patterns we observe in the cross section.
Another concern may be that, in the earlier periods, observable family characteristics do a poor
job of characterizing the true family background for blacks but do a better job for whites. This could be
due to poor labor market and educational opportunities for blacks in the 1940s and 50s, which would
make otherwise able individuals choose not to get more education. As a result, although families may
appear, based on observables, to have family backgrounds less conducive to higher educational
attainment, unobservable parental “quality” among blacks may actually be higher than observable
characteristics suggest. As a result, the pattern we see would merely be an artifact of improper
classification of blacks. Over time, observable characteristics may become a better measure of family
background for blacks, which is why we would observe the cross-section relationship flattening over
time.
One observation that refutes this possibility is that we do not see the same pattern when we
13

isolate the earliest part of our sample, the late 1960s. If it were really the case that weak measures of
family background for blacks caused the cross-sectional relationship we observe in the 1970s and early
80s, then we would expect to see the same relationship in the 1960s. But we don=t; in fact, we observe
the same relationship in the 1960s as we do in the 1990s.
As another test, we considered the extreme case. If comparing blacks and whites with similar
family background characteristics is not a valid comparison, as we have assumed thus far, then what if
we compare blacks and whites at the same percentile in their own racial distribution of family
background characteristics? This methodology implicitly assumes that blacks and whites have the same
underlying distribution of family backgrounds, even though observably blacks look worse. To test this,
we run regressions of the probability of college enrollment as a function of observable characteristics
separately for blacks and whites and then rank individuals in each group based on their predicted
values. We then compare individuals at the different percentiles in each group; that is, we compare the
probability of college enrollment for individuals in the 20th percentile of the black distribution to those in
the 20th percentile of the white distribution. Table 5 presents the results when we do this; it allows us to
compare college enrollment probabilities for the bottom 20% of the black distribution to the bottom
20% of the white distribution, the middle part of the two distributions, and then the top 20% of both
distributions.12 We can see that the same relationship appears to hold, although it is somewhat weaker.
Blacks at the lower end of their SES distribution still do relatively better than those at the upper end

12

Note that in earlier comparisons, the bottom 20% of the SES distribution was not calculated
separately for blacks and whites; as a result, we were comparing individuals with similar observable
family background characteristics instead of blacks and whites at the same points in their own
distribution.
14

relative to their white equivalents. The results of this “extreme” case regression offer convincing
evidence that low-SES blacks are outperforming their white counterparts. In Table 5, by assuming a
similar distribution of characteristics across the races, we are now comparing whites to blacks who are
observably much worse (because, on average, blacks have worse family background characteristics
than whites especially at the low end of the SES spectrum). We still see low-SES blacks performing
the relative best.

Different Costs and Benefits of College Enrollment
Another explanation is that individuals are behaving optimally, considering costs and benefits,
and the observed patterns of behavior reflect responses to different choice sets. When an individual is
deciding whether to enroll in college, he/she considers a number of factors. The first is the cost of going
to college, both the direct cost in terms of tuition, as well as the indirect cost in terms of the opportunity
cost of not working. He also considers the benefit, generally measured as the financial return to going to
college. Because these factors can vary across individuals of different socioeconomic status as well as
over time, they may be able to explain the pattern we observe in the data. Either blacks face different
costs or benefits of going to college, or, facing the same costs and benefits, they respond differently for
some reason. We explore whether we see any evidence of this in the data.
The existing literature has already considered the effect of local labor market conditions on
college enrollment (See, for example, Rivkin 1995); however, in doing so, they have been limited by a
single cross-sectional analysis or have assumed that blacks and whites face the same labor market and
therefore include a single measure for blacks and whites (see, for example, Kane 1995). Theory
15

suggests that strong labor markets will discourage college attendance, as the opportunity cost is higher.
However, in general, the average wage as a measure of the opportunity costs tends to work in the
wrong direction, as blacks are more likely to live in cities, which have higher wages. Average local
wages and unemployment rates have had little success explaining variation in college enrollment.
As mentioned earlier, there is limited work that has considered the fact that blacks face a
different labor market from whites. However, the idea that they face different labor markets is
consistent with the evidence presented in Bound and Freeman (1992) showing that, from the mid 1970s
through the 1980s, there was a widening in black-white earnings and employment gaps among young
men, with the gap in earnings widening particularly among college graduates and in the Midwest and the
gap in employment widening most among high school dropouts. Figures 4 and 5 show the distinction
between black and white labor market outcomes, specifically unemployment rates and the college
premium; this disparity between black and white labor market experiences suggests a need for
considering them separately.
Finally, the literature has assumed that individuals from advantaged backgrounds respond
similarly to costs and labor market conditions as do individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. This,
however, is an empirical question that we test directly. In particular, earlier evidence has suggested that
college costs play an important role in determining college enrollment; however, if college costs have a
differential impact based on family background, policies targeted at individuals from disadvantaged
backgrounds need to incorporate these differences in order to evaluate the potential impact of the
policy.
Table 6 tests these hypotheses by examining the relationship between race-specific local labor
16

market variables, college tuition, and college enrollment. We first present results when coefficients on
these variables are constrained to be the same for all individuals of the same race, as the earlier literature
has done, and then allow the impact to vary by family background.
We include a number of labor market measures in our regression. Ideally, we would like to
calculate labor market variables that vary by race, state, and year. Unfortunately, the March CPS does
not contain sufficient observations to calculate such labor market variables. As a result, we calculate
time-, race-, and state-varying labor market variables using the Outgoing Rotation for the years 19791998.13 Because the Outgoing Rotation begins in 1979, we use the March CPS to calculate time-,
race-, and region-varying, labor market variables from 1973-1979. The March CPS does not
provide consistent state identifiers prior to 1976; we use their more aggregate identifier which breaks
the country into 21 state groups.14
Our first measure of local labor market conditions is the unemployment rate, calculated using
individuals 25-40 years of age. We calculate it separately for blacks and whites; if blacks faced higher
unemployment rates in the market, possibly due to factors such as discrimination, they may be more
likely to go to college than observably equivalent whites.
We also consider the relative return to a college education, measured as the ratio of the average
wage for college graduates aged 25-40 to the average wage for high school graduates for the same age

13

Local labor market variables constructed using the Outgoing Rotation are 3 year moving averages.
All state-level data was aggregated to the state-group level by averaging across individuals in the
states, thereby giving more weight to larger states. From here on in the paper, when we refer to states
we are actually referring to state-groups.
14

17

group among full time workers.15 Again, we calculate a race-specific measure, allowing for different
returns for blacks and whites in a particular state.
As a measure of college costs, we utilize resident university tuition data from the State of
Washington Higher Education Coordinating Board. These data vary by state and by year for the years
in our sample. To calculate the appropriate “state-group” tuition, we use a weighted average of state
tuitions within the group, with weights given by the respective state population for the given year.
Table 6 presents the results when we estimate probit models of college enrollment for blacks
and whites separately. Only the coefficients on the labor market and tuition variables are shown;
however, the regressions all include the family background, regional, and center city/rural variables
presented in Table 4.
Columns 1 and 3 present the basic results when one includes tuition and local labor market
variables in a college enrollment regression. While whites appear to respond as expected to both labor
market and tuition variables, this is not true for blacks; in fact, these variables do little to explain what is
happening with black college enrollment.16 Among whites, Column 1 shows that a higher college
premium increases college enrollment, as does a higher unemployment rate and lower tuition (although at
a decreasing rate as tuition rises). In columns 2 and 4, we allow for differential impacts of these
variables by family background category. In the case of both blacks and whites, tuition appears to have
a significant impact on college enrollment among low-SES individuals. However, this effect disappears
among higher SES blacks, while it holds true among whites of all SES groups. Notably, whites respond

15

A full-time worker is defined as one who worked at least 35 hours the previous week.
16 Note that Kane (1994) finds a significant impact of tuition on college enrollment. This result appears
18

strongly to labor market variables, with high SES whites responding even more strongly to the college
premium than lower SES whites. On the contrary, blacks appear to respond negatively to the college
premium. This reflects in large part the fact that blacks appear to respond perversely to the high school
wage—as high school wages deteriorated during the late 1970s and early 1980s, it appears that blacks
did not respond by enrolling in college, as would be expected. Low SES blacks responded to
increasing tuition costs by reducing college attendance, while at the same time low SES blacks did not
respond to labor market factors that should encourage college enrollment. To understand the magnitude
of their responsiveness, within the relevant range, an increase in tuition of approximately 5% reduces
college enrollment of low SES blacks by almost 35%.
These results suggest some important patterns. Among whites, tuition costs and local labor
markets appear to have a significant impact on their college enrollment decisions (and these effects are
even stronger among high SES individuals). On the contrary, blacks appear to be relatively insensitive
(or even responding in a way that is negatively related) to local labor market conditions. Tuition
appears to be the only policy variable that has a strong impact on blacks, and only those from poorer
family backgrounds.
How much of the variation in enrollment among blacks and whites do these variables explain?
Figure 6 presents white college enrollment, black college enrollment, and predicted college enrollment
for blacks if they had white characteristics and faced white tuition costs and labor market conditions.
(i.e. using black coefficients from table 6 column 4). We can see that, although family background, local
labor market characteristics, and tuition costs can explain much of the differences between black and

to be quite sensitive to the model specification.

white college enrollment in the later period, it actually overpredicts black college enrollment in the earlier
period.
Although we explain little of the overall variation, the results have important policy implications.
Earlier work that suggested that college tuition has an important impact on college enrollment behavior
did not consider different responses by individuals from diverse family backgrounds. However,
empirical evidence suggests that there may be diverse responses. As a result, efforts targeted at
improving college enrollment among disadvantaged individuals must consider the appropriate
relationship when evaluating different policies.

V. Other Possible Explanations
Affirmative Action
Anecdotal evidence suggests that affirmative action may be an explanation for the patterns we
observe. Clearly, if we knew nothing beyond the positive coefficient on the black dummy in the college
enrollment equation, this would seem like a reasonable explanation. In addition, the time series seems
roughly consistent with affirmative action: increasing strength in the late 1970s and then declining in the
1980s.
However, when we examine more closely, we see a number of contradictions. First, if there is
affirmative action in hiring and wages/promotion, then we would expect our race-varying labor market
measures to reflect this; black workers would have lower unemployment rates or higher wages as a
result.
If there were affirmative action in college admission, we would expect this to affect blacks
20

across the SES spectrum and would thereby observe a level shift up of black enrollment instead of the
pattern we observe, with low-SES blacks more likely and high-SES blacks less likely to attend college
than equivalent whites. In addition, anecdotal evidence also suggests that colleges most likely to admit
based on affirmative action would be those who would attempt to Acream-skim@ the best black
students; in this case, we would expect the opposite pattern from the cross-section we observe.
Directly testing the effects of affirmative action is difficult, however, because of the difficulty in
measuring differences in the “effectiveness” of affirmative action in different states at different times. We
can, however, compare the patterns we observe in two year- versus four year-colleges. Because many
two year colleges have open enrollment, we would not expect to see the same relationship in two-year
as in four-year college enrollment if affirmative action is the underlying cause. When we estimate a
multinomial logit where the potential outcomes are no college enrollment, two-year college enrollment,
and four-year college enrollment (Table 7), we see similar relationships for both types of college
enrollment. In the earliest period, the lowest SES blacks are more likely to attend college than the
equivalent whites for both two- and four-year colleges. In the middle period, this relationship persists
among four year college enrollees but dissipates among the two-year college students. Finally, in the
third period, this relationship has disappeared among all students, and blacks are unambiguously less
likely to attend either type of college than equivalent whites. These results suggest that it is not
affirmative action among the four-year colleges that is driving the relationship.17

17

We use the October CPS for this estimation because the March does not distinguish between
enrollment in two-year and four-year colleges. It is interesting to note that, over this time period, the
percentage of blacks attending two year colleges as a fraction of total blacks attending college is
remaining relatively constant, as is this number for whites.
21

Credit Constraints/Pell Grants
There is also a literature that considers the effect of credit constraints on college enrollment
decisions. If blacks face different credit constraints than whites, then one might expect to see different
patterns of college enrollment by race. Cameron and Heckman (2001) examine this directly to
determine whether differences in college enrollment by race are due to differences in family background
or differences in the availability of credit. The authors conclude that it is family background, and not
credit constraints, that explain the relationship between family characteristics and school attendance. In
contrast, Acemoglu and Pischke (2001) exploit changes in the distribution of family income to examine
the effect of parental resources on college education and find evidence of large effects of family income
on college enrollment.
In the CPS, we do not observe wealth, so it is difficult to test this directly. Our findings on this
topic are mixed, however. Though the cross-section pattern we observe runs counter to traditional
belief that poorer blacks are more credit constrained than equivalent whites, the fact that we find that
tuition has such a strong impact on low SES blacks (and not blacks from wealthier backgrounds) may
provide some support for the credit constraint argument.18

Pell Grants

18

Another proposed explanation is differences in school quality by race. However, to observe the
relationship we see, it would have to be the case that poorer Blacks, who receive lower quality
education, are compensating by increasing the quantity. This runs counter to much of the evidence
on the relationship between school quality and quantity, which suggests a positive relationship
22

Finally, Kane (1994) also considers the roll of financial aid in the form of Pell grants and finds
little effect of changes in Pell grants on college enrollment. More specifically, he looks at the
establishment of Pell grant awards and compares changes in college enrollment for eligible versus
ineligible youths before and after the implementation of the program. He concludes that there is little
evidence that those to whom the Pell grant program was targeted enjoyed particularly large increases in
enrollment.
It is unlikely that changes in Pell grant generosity are driving the relationships we observe in the
data. Given that Pell grants are not race-specific but instead are income specific, we should not expect
to see differential effects of Pell grants within SES class; low-income individuals should benefit equally
regardless of race. Additionally, we see similar results when we allow year*SES effects, which should
pick up any changes in the generosity of Pell Grants for low-SES individuals.
However, it may be the case that there are wealth differences among low-SES blacks and
whites that we are unable to pick up in our dataset. Because we observe differential behavior by SES
and race, this could be consistent with some sort of financial aid/credit constrain story. Further work
needs to address this issue, focusing on the differential impact by family background.19

V. Conclusion
Although it is well-documented in the literature that, controlling for family background

between the two. (See Light and Strayer, 2000).
19 Consistent with the findings in this paper, recent work by Linsenmeier, Rosen, and Rouse (2002)
finds differential effects of financial aid packages on low-income blacks and whites when they focus on
one university.
23

characteristics, blacks are more likely to attend college than whites, very little work has focused on
explaining this phenomenon. The literature instead has primarily focused on understanding the time
series patterns of black college enrollment.
This paper attempts to understand what is driving this difference between black and white
college enrollment. Interestingly, it is not the blacks at the high end of the family background spectrum
who are more likely to attend college than their white counterparts; it is the blacks at the bottom of the
SES spectrum who are driving this result. In addition, this relationship appears to flatten over time; by
the 1990s, blacks at all parts of the SES spectrum are less likely to attend college than equivalent
whites.
We examine possible explanations for this phenomenon and make a number of conclusions.
First, contrary to earlier evidence, college tuition appears to explain very little of the observed pattern.
Interestingly, we do uncover differential responses by individuals from different family backgrounds. As
a result, although we explain little of the overall variation in college enrollment, the results have important
policy implications. Earlier work that suggested that college tuition has an important impact on college
enrollment behavior did not consider different responses by individuals from diverse family
backgrounds. However, the empirical evidence suggests that there may be diverse responses. In
particular, low-income blacks appear to be very sensitive to changes in tuition costs, while blacks from
middle- or high- SES backgrounds are not. As a result, efforts targeted at improving college enrollment
among disadvantaged individuals must consider the appropriate relationship when evaluating different
policies.
While this paper has focused on differences between blacks and whites, these findings suggest
24

the need for more extensive research when considering policies directed at the assimilation of more
disadvantaged groups into the education system, and future research will extend this analysis to
immigrants. It is not surprising that appropriate education policies vary for by race for different target
groups. This research suggests that these policies must also take into account different behavioral
responses based on family background characteristics as well.
