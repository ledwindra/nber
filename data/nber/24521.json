    "abstract": "\n\nWe assess the power of forward guidance\u2014promises about future interest rates\u2014as a monetary tool in a liquidity trap using a quantitative incomplete-markets model. Our results suggest the effects of forward guidance are negligible. A commitment to keep future nominal interest rates low for a few quarters\u2014although macro indicators suggest otherwise\u2014has only trivial effects on current output and employment. We explain theoretically why in complete markets models forward guidance is powerful\u2014generating a \u201cforward guidance puzzle\u201d\u2014and why this puzzle disappears in our model. We also clarify theoretically ambiguous conclusions from previous research about the effectiveness of forward guidance in incomplete and complete markets models.\n\n",
