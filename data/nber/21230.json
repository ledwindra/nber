    "abstract": "\n\nSpence (1973) noted that individuals\u2019 choice of educational quantity\u2014measured by years of schooling\u2014may stem partially from a desire to signal their ability to the labor market. This paper asks if individuals\u2019 choice of educational quality\u2014measured by college reputation\u2014may likewise signal their ability. We use data on the admission scores of all Colombian college graduates to define a measure of reputation that gives clear predictions in a signaling framework. We find that college reputation, unlike years of schooling, is correlated with graduates\u2019 earnings growth. We also show that Colombia\u2019s staggered rollout of a new signal of skill\u2014a college exit exam\u2014reduced the earnings return to reputation and increased the return to individual admission scores. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a college\u2019s reputation provides information about the ability of its student body and about its value added, broadly understood.\n\n",
