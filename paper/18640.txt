Fast-Food Restaurant Advertising on Television and Its Influence on Youth Body Composition

NBER Working Paper No. 18640

JEL No. I10,I18
ABSTRACT
We examine the effects of fast-food restaurant advertising on television on the body composition of
adolescents as measured by percentage body fat (PBF) and to assess the sensitivity of these effects
to using conventional measures of youth obesity based on body-mass index (BMI). We merge measures
of body composition from bioelectrical-impedance analysis (BIA) and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
(DXA) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with individual level data from
the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 and data on local fast-food restaurant advertising
on television from Competitive Media Reporting. Exposure to fast-food restaurant advertising on television
causes statistically significant increases in PBF in adolescents. These results are consistent with those
obtained by using BMI-based measures of obesity. The responsiveness to fast-food advertising is
greater for PBF than for BMI. Males are more responsive to advertising than females regardless of
the measure. A complete advertising ban on fast-food restaurants on television would reduce BMI
by 2 percent and PBF by 3 percent. The elimination of the tax deductibility of food advertising costs
would still leave a considerable number of youth exposed to fast-food advertising on television but
would still result in non-trivial reductions in obesity.

Introduction
The proportion of youths between ages 12-19 who are obese has increased
substantially in the U.S. from 5.0 % in the mid-1970s to 18.1 percent in late 2000s [1].
Suspected social causes of youth obesity include television advertising of unhealthy,
nutrient-dense food on aimed at youths [2-4]. However, there has been little empirical
evidence confirming such an effect until recently [5]. Accordingly, there has been a call
from the White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity for additional research to
demonstrate the link between advertising and food preferences and consumption by
children and adolescents [6]. It is critical to provide further insights into the determinants
of childhood obesity to help efforts of policy-makers in the design of more effective
prevention policies. In a recent comprehensive study, Chou, Rashad, and Grossman [3]
(CRG hereafter) use individual-level data from the National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth 1997 (NLSY97), and find a positive and statistically significant association
between fast-food restaurant advertising on television and youths’ body mass index
(BMI) and the probability of being obese (age-gender adjusted BMI ranking ≥ 95th
percentile). In another study, Andreyeva, Kelly, and Harris [5] use a sample of 5th
graders to document that soft drink and fast food television advertising is positively
associated with the probability of being overweight (age-gender adjusted BMI ranking ≥
85th percentile) but not with bodyweight. They hypothesize that the weak association
may be due to mismeasurement by BMI-based proxies for youth obesity.
While BMI is a widely accepted proxy for obesity, its limitation in distinguishing
body fat and lean body mass is well-documented [7-11]. For example, BMI provides
limited information on the degree of obesity in youths older than 10 years of age [12]

3

while the association of BMI with body fatness in children differ substantially by gender,
race, and age [13]. Thus, an increasing number of studies highlight the importance of
using alternative measures of obesity for estimation purposes [8]. Several studies
recommend using body composition or percentage body fat (PBF) for identification of
youth overweight status [14].
Body composition, however, is considerably more difficult to measure and
therefore has not been used by social scientists until recently. With the advancements in
measurement technologies such as bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and dual
energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), the cost of measuring body composition has been
reduced substantially and these measures are now available in several in large-scale
surveys [15]. Using such data, social scientists have begun to compare the sensitivity of
BMI-based findings to those based on body composition among adults [16, 17]. To this
date, no such sensitivity analysis has been conducted for youths. This is the first study to
analyze the impact of fast-food advertising on body composition among youths. We also
examine the sensitivity of the results obtained in CRG to our results using body
composition measures of youth obesity.
Methods
To maintain comparability between the results in our paper and those in CRG, we
draw on the same data sources as CRG.
Primary Individual Data
Individual-level data on youths aged 12 to 18 are obtained from the NLSY97,
which contains a nationally representative sample of the U.S. youths. The initial sample
in 1997 consists of 8,984 respondents aged 12 to 16 years old and contains extensive

4

information about youth labor market behavior and educational attainment. A parent
questionnaire with information on family background and a youth questionnaire on
weekly hours of time spent in watching television for youths aged 12 to 14 were also
administered in Round 1. Following the CRG, we use 1997 values for 1998 and 1999.
The pooled sample size is 14,852 after observations with missing values are deleted and
before advertising and state-level data are merged.
Fast-food restaurant television advertising data
We also obtain fast-food restaurant television advertising data from Competitive
Media Reporting (CMR), the largest provider of advertising tracking services in the U.S.
The advertising exposure, which is the number of seconds restaurant advertising aired per
week per area, is collected for fast-food restaurant chains in the U.S. from 1996 to 1999.
The exposure data are then converted to the number of hours per week.
The unit of area for advertising exposure is Designated Market Area (DMA),
which is similar to a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Each DMA is a television
market composed of counties (and occasionally part of counties). The top 75 out of about
210 DMAs are contained in the CMR database. Merging the advertising exposure data
by DMA results in an analysis sample of 7,069 person-years. Using the information on
weekly hours of television viewed in NLSY97, we calculate the weekly hours of fastfood advertising seen as follows:
Sijt = (Tijt/168)Ajt K,

(1)

where Tijt is the weekly number of hours that the youth watches television, 168 is the
number of hours in a week, Ajt is the weekly number of hours of fast-food ads aired, and
K is a positive constant. We take natural log to address positive skewness in Sijt and Tijt:

5

lnSijt = lnTijt - ln168 + lnAjt + lnK,

(2)

The natural log transformation mitigates the influence of outliers, while also allowing
each control variable to have a diminishing marginal effect on BMI or obesity. Therefore
we have three key variables: ln(TV-time), ln(Ads-aired), and ln(Ads-seen).
Alternative measures of youth obesity
Body composition is described by the following identity:
W ≡ BF + FFM

(3)

where W is weight in kilograms, BF is body fat, and FFM is fat-free mass. PBF or
percentage body fat is therefore,
PBF = 100 *

BF
.
BF + FFM

(4)

We make use of both BIA and DXA measures of body composition that are
available in the following waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey: NHANES III (1988 through 1994), NHANES 1999-2000, NHANES 2001-2002,
and NHANES 2003-2004 [18].
In the BIA method, body composition is estimated by measuring the electrical
resistance of a body to a weak electrical current [19]. The observed electrical resistance,
which is negatively associated with FFM, is converted into FFM by entering it into a
predetermined equation obtained from a multiple regression analysis along with a set of
external measurements such as weight, height, age, and gender [20, 21]. After FFM is
obtained from the prediction equation, BF is computed from the identity in equation (3),
which is then combined with equation (4) to yield the following form:
PBF ≡ 100 *

BF
W − FFM
≡ 100 *
.

Following previous studies [16, 17], we employ a prediction equation developed
by Chumlea [20] for particular use with NHANES III. We also used a prediction
equation developed by Boileau [22] for children aged 8 through 16. These equations
yield two sets of values for FFM and BF in NHANES.
A third set of body composition is obtained from the DXA measurement, also
available in the NHANES. In this procedure, a complete body scan is administered in
which two low dose x-rays are absorbed at different rates by bone and soft tissue mass
[19, 23]. The computed amount of BF and FFM are directly reported in NHANES
without the need for prediction equations.
Estimating alternative youth obesity measures
Because there is only one year of overlap between the NHANES waves and the
CMR fast-food restaurant advertising data (1997-1999), we employ the procedures
developed by Wada and Tekin [17] to obtain PBF measures in NLSY97, using
information derived from NHANES. A similar strategy was also used by a recent study
for examining the effect of body composition on European employment outcome [24].
In this procedure, we predict FFM and BF values in NLSY97 using regression
coefficients obtained from the NHANES analysis. First, we separately regress FFM and
body fat on weight, weight2, height, height2, age, age2, and weight*height in NHANES.
This estimation is implemented for each of the six gender-race/ethnicity combinations
(white non-Hispanic males, white non-Hispanic females, black non-Hispanic males,
black non-Hispanic females, Hispanic males, and Hispanic females). We use persons of
all ages in NHANES to increase the power in these regressions. The explanatory power
in these regressions is high, with R2 values ranging between 0.80 and 0.90. The

7

coefficients from these regressions and the values of the independent variables in
NLSY97 are then used to impute values for FFM and BF in NLSY97.
After computing FFM and BF in NLSY97, we use the three sets of BF and FFM
estimates to calculate the corresponding PBFs using equations (4) and (5). Therefore, we
obtain one measure of PBF based on DXA (PBF-D), another based on BIA with
Chumlea’s equation (PBF-C), and a third one based on BIA with Boileau’s equation
(PBF-B).
Conventional measures of youth obesity
Traditional obesity measures are BMI and an obesity indicator that equals one if
the adolescent is obese (age-gender adjusted BMI ranking ≥ 95th percentile). BMI is
calculated as W/H2, where W is weight in kilograms and H is height in meters.
State-level data
Following CRG, we include in our models state-level variables that are merged
with the NLSY97 by state and year. These include the number of fast-food restaurants,
the number of full-service restaurants, the price of a meal in each type of restaurant, an
index of price of food at home, the price of cigarettes, and clean indoor air laws. Detailed
descriptions of their sources, definitions, and relevance have been previously discussed
[25].
Estimation strategy
We use a multiple regression method. Given the large sample size, we fit linear
probability models for binary obesity outcome. The coefficients from linear probability
models are consistent estimates of average probability derivatives, but the standard errors
are biased as a result of heteroskedasticity [26]. Thus, we report standard errors that are

8

robust to any form of heteroskedasticity. We also employ sampling weights and cluster
standard errors on DMA, given that the advertising variables are repeated within DMA.
Our most comprehensive regression model is:
Yijt = γ 0 + γ 1 ln S ijt + γ 2 ln Tijt + β1 X ijt + β 2 M ijt + β 3 Z ijt + µ j + ν t + ε ijt .

(6)

In this equation, the dependent variable (Yijt) is the various obesity measures for youth i
in DMA j surveyed in year t. The regressors are the ln of the weekly hours of television
fast-food restaurant advertising seen (ln Sijt); the ln of the weekly hours spent watching
television (ln Tijt); a vector of demographic variables for youths, including age, race, and
gender (Xijt); a vector of variables containing mother’s employment status, household
income, a dummy for missing income, and dummy variables indicating whether the
mother is overweight (BMI ≥ 25) or obese (BMI ≥ 30) (Mijt); a vector of state-specific
variables including the per capita number of fast-food restaurants, the per capita number
of full-service restaurants, the real cigarette price, dichotomous indicators for clean
indoor air laws, the real full-service restaurant price, the real food at home price, and the
real fast-food restaurant price (Zijt); and vectors indicating DMA (µj) and year (νt). The
disturbance term is εijt. An advantage of the specification given by equation (6) is that it
allows the amount of time spent watching television to have an effect on weight
outcomes that is independent of the number of hours of fast-food restaurant advertising
ads seen.
Using the definition of Sijt in equations (1) and (2), equation (6) can be rewritten
as
Yijt = γ 0 + γ 1 ln K − γ 1 ln 168 + γ 1 ln A jt + (γ 1 + γ 2 ) ln Tijt + β1 X ijt + β 2 M ijt + β 3 Z ijt + µ j + ν t + ε ijt . (7)

Results
Table 1 displays descriptive statistics for the five obesity outcomes of interest for
all youths and by gender. These five outcomes are BMI, an indicator that equals 1 if a
youth is obese (Obese) according to age-gender adjusted BMI ranking, and the three
measures of PBF described earlier (PBF-D, PBF-C, and PBF-B). The sample sizes for
PBF measures are slightly lower due to restricting the sample to non-Hispanics whites,
non-Hispanics black, and Hispanics. As shown in Table 1, the means for the three PBF
measures are very similar. For males, the mean PBF is between 19 and 20 percent, while
for females, it is between 29 and 31 percent. The PBF estimates based on DXA are
slightly higher than the estimates based on BIA. In turn, PBF-B is slightly higher than
PBF-C.
To compare our estimates of PBF in NLSY97 with actual measures in NHANES,
we present means and standard deviations of the three PBF variables in Table 2. We
have computed these figures from NHANES 1999-2000, 2001-2002, and 2003-2004.
Except in the case of male PBF-B, the means in Table 2 are larger than those in Table 1,
which is likely due to under-reporting of weight in the NLSY. For males, the range is
between 20 and 24 percent, while for females, it is between 29 and 34 percent. For
comparison purposes, we also show the statistics for BMI and Obese in NHANES 19992000. The under-reporting of weight by females is clearly reflected in the difference
between the percentage of obese females of 14 percent in NHANES and 7 percent in
NLSY97.
There is a high correlation among our five body composition measures. As
expected, the correlation coefficients among the three measures of PBF are very high

10

within gender ranging from 0.91 to 0.99 for males and from 0.97 to 0.99 for females.
BMI also is highly correlated with the measures of PBF. The correlations fall between
0.89 and 0.96 for males and between 0.91 and 0.92 for females. Given the dichotomous
nature of the Obese indicator, the raw correlations between Obese and each of the other
four variables are smaller. Specifically, they are between 0.67 and 0.76 for males and
between 0.54 and 0.72 for females.
Table 3 reproduces the regression results obtained by CRG. Regressions in which
BMI or Obese is used as the dependent variable are estimated with a slightly smaller
sample, but yield results that are almost identical to those in CRG.
Table 4 presents the estimation results from two alternative specifications with the
three measures of PBF. In each of the nine specification (6) regressions in Table 5, we
find a positive and significant relationship between television viewing time and the PBF.
All nine coefficients of advertising ads are positive and five are statistically significant.
The exceptions pertain to the three coefficients for females and the male coefficient for
PBF-DXA, which is consistent with the non-significant advertising coefficients in the
female regressions in Table 3 from CRG.
In each of the nine specifications in Table 4, we test the hypothesis that
coefficient of the ln(TV-time) is equal to the coefficient of the ln(Ads-aired). Similar to
Table 3, we fail to reject the hypothesis that the two coefficients are the same in every
case. Therefore, we estimate a second model [specification (2)] in which the ln(Adsaired) and the ln(TV-time) are replaced with the ln(Ads-seen). This is equivalent to
constraining the coefficient of the ln(TV-time) to equal the coefficient of the ln(Adsaired). In this specification all nine coefficients are significant.

11

Focusing on the gender-specific results for specification (2) in Table 4, one sees
that the coefficients of the ln(Ads-seen) do not vary much, ranging from 0.58 (female
PBF-D) to 0.76 (male PBF-B). The male coefficient is larger than the corresponding
female coefficient except for PBF-C. The last finding aside, these results mirror those in
Table 3.
One way to gauge the magnitudes of the effects is to compute their elasticities
with respect to the number of ads seen (ln S in the version of equation (6) that omits ln
T). Given the semi-logarithmic form of the equation, the elasticity is γ1/ Y, where Y is the
mean of the dependent variable in the regression and γ1 is the regression coefficient of
lnS. The elasticities are presented in the left panel of Table 5 using the population mean
from NHANES. All the male elasticities exceed the corresponding female elasticities,
and the PBF elasticities exceed the corresponding BMI elasticities. A 10 percent increase
in the number of ads seen increases each outcome by between 0.2 percent and 0.4
percent. Yet as shown below, a small absolute or percentage increase in BMI can have a
substantial impact on the percentage increase in the number of obese youths. It is notable
that an average of the three male PBF elasticities is almost 40 percent larger than the BMI
elasticity. For females, the average PBF elasticity is 25 percent larger than the BMI
elasticity.
CRG put their results into context by simulating an increase in the number of ads
seen that is equal to its coefficient of variation. On average, youths view approximately
half an hour per week of fast-food advertising ads. Since the coefficient of variation of
this variable is approximately equal to one in each regression, these computations reveal
the impacts of an increase in exposure to this type of advertising of half an hour per

12

week. They only make these computations for the obesity indicator, but we compute
them for all five dependent variables. Following the approach by CRG, we conduct
similar simulations. As shown in the right panel of Table 5, increasing exposure to fastfood advertising by half an hour per week will increase the probability of being obese by
2.5 percentage points among males. This translates into a 17 percent increase in the
number of obese male youths in a fixed population. The corresponding figures for
females are a 0.6 percentage point increase and a 4 percent increase in the number of
obese adolescent girls in a fixed population. The simulations for the other four
continuous outcomes suggest much smaller effects, especially among males. Focusing on
percentage changes, the corresponding figures range from about 1 percent (female BMI)
to approximately 3 percent (male PBF-B). It should be realized, however, that only the
obesity indicator is discrete. To highlight this difference, suppose that the BMI of each
male and each female in our sample increased by the amount predicted in Table 5, i.e.,
0.38 and 0.25, respectively. Then the probability of being obese would rise by 1.1
percentage points for males and by 0.5 percentage points for females. These effects
translate into a 7 percent increase in the number of obese male youths in a fixed
population and to a 3 percent increase in the number of obese female youths. While these
are smaller than those obtained directly from the regression for the probability of being
obese, they are non-trivial.
Discussion
Our results indicate that exposure to fast-food restaurant advertising on television
causes statistically significant increases in PBF in youths. We obtain a larger effect by
using PBF rather BMI as youth obesity outcome. Our results indicate that a complete

13

advertising ban would reduce BMI by about 2 percent and would reduce PBF by around
3 percent. Note that very modest changes in body composition can be associated with
substantial reductions in the number of obese youths. The BMI effects translate into a 6
percent reduction in the number of obese youths by the advertising ban. Similar to CRG,
we conclude that exposure to fast-food restaurant advertising on television causes
statistically significant increases in the body mass index of youths and on the probability
that they are obese. The obesity effect is larger in absolute value. A complete ban on
these advertisements would reduce the number of obese youths by 14 percent. Another
policy option alternative to banning such advertising on television could be the
elimination of the tax deductibility of food advertising costs. While such a policy would
still leave a considerable number of youth exposed to fast-food advertising on television,
it may still result in non-trivial reductions in obesity
Since the PBF effects in Table 5 are larger than the corresponding BMI effects, it
would be useful to employ an obesity indicator defined by PBF as an additional outcome.
We have placed this issue on an agenda for future research because obesity cutoffs based
on PBF are not yet well developed. For example, Boreham, Twisk, and Savage [27]
classify male youths with PBF greater than 20 percent as obese and adolescent girls with
PBF greater than 24 percent as obese. If these cutoffs are applied to our NLSY data,
approximately 50 percent of males and 90 percent of females are classified as obese.
Even if the cutoffs for adults recommended by the National Institute of Diabetes and
Digestive and Kidney Diseases [28] for adults of greater than 25 percent for males and
greater than 30 percent for females are used, approximately 22 percent of males and 60
percent of females are identified as obese. It is valuable to examine the characteristics of

14

individuals classified as obese by one measure but not the other and vice versa. It also is
valuable to obtain PBF cutoffs that result in the same percentage of obese youths as BMI
cutoffs.
We conclude by re-emphasizing that it would be useful to develop an obesity
indicator defined by the PBF, to use this outcome as an additional dependent variable,
and to examine non-linear effects. These might take the form of greater sensitivity to
advertising by youths just below the BMI obesity cutoff or to the corresponding PBF
cutoff than by other youths. The ideal data for such an investigation would contain both
actual measures of the PBF and detailed information on exposure to fast-food restaurant
advertising.

Note: All regressions are weighted by NLSY sampling weights. T-ratios, reported in
brackets, are based on standard errors that are clustered at the DMA level. Sample sizes
in the regressions in panel B are the same as in the corresponding regressions in panel A.
All coefficients are adjusted for individual characteristics, state variables, DMA fixed
effects, and year fixed effects. Individual variables include age, black non-Hispanic,
Hispanic, other race, male (in regressions that are not gender-specific), family income,
missing income dummy, mother overweight, mother obese, and mother employed. State
variables include the per capita number of fast-food restaurants, per capita number of
full-service restaurants, real cigarette price, dummies for clean indoor air laws, real fullservice restaurant price, real food at home price, and real fast-food restaurant price. *: p <
0.10 (one-tailed test); ** : p < 0.05 (one-tailed test); ***: p< 0.01 (one-tailed test).
