Do Analysts Herd? An Analysis of Recommendations and Market Reactions

JEL No. G14,G24
ABSTRACT
This paper develops and implements a new test to investigate whether sell-side analysts herd around
the consensus when they make stock recommendations. Our empirical results support the herding
hypothesis. Stock price reactions following recommendation revisions are stronger when the new recommendation
is away from the consensus than when it is closer to it, indicating that the market recognizes analysts
tendency to herd. We find that analysts from larger brokerages and analysts following stocks with
smaller dispersion across recommendations are more likely to herd.

1. Introduction
Media accounts and academic studies often attribute many market ills such as
excess market volatility, the internet bubble and the emerging market meltdown in the
nineties to the phenomenon of herding. The term “herding” refers broadly to the tendency
of many different agents, who make their own individual decisions, to take similar
actions at roughly the same time. Portfolio managers, stock analysts, individual investors,
and corporate managers are among the many who have been portrayed as having been
afflicted by herding instincts.
Why do individuals herd? The theoretical and empirical literature in economics
and finance offer many reasons.1 One reason why individuals may herd is because they
act based on similar information. Their information may be similar either because they all
independently acquired signals that happen to be correlated, or they may have rationally
extracted other agents’ information from their actions. Alternatively, individuals may
herd because they derive utility from imitating others, either because of an inherent desire
to conform2 or because their financial incentive structure rewards conformity.
An anecdotal example which is often cited as evidence of herding is the
investment patterns during the latter half of the nineties, often referred to as the internet
bubble period. During this period, mutual funds as a group invested an increasing portion
of their assets in technology stocks. Even funds that traditionally invested in value stocks
moved progressively towards investing in new economy stocks. One possible explanation
for this herd behavior is that it is information driven. Funds may have optimally utilized

See Bikhchandani and Sharma (2001), Hirshleifer and Teoh (2003), and Devenow and Welch (1996) for
detailed surveys of the herding literature.

The idea of irrational herding dates back at least to Keynes (1936), where he compares stock market to a
beauty contest where judges voted on who they thought other judges would vote for.

the information available at that point in time (which includes others’ actions), and
rationally anticipated unprecedented growth for internet stocks. Although in hindsight we
know that such expectations were overly optimistic, it is hard to rule out the possibility
that the internet stock prices were rational based on ex ante information available to
investors. Alternatively, it is possible that many funds moved into internet stocks merely
because of a desire to imitate their cohorts, although they truly believed that internet
stocks were overvalued based on all available information.
As this anecdote illustrates, it is generally hard to empirically differentiate
between imitation and information-driven herding because we only observe the actions,
but not the motives behind those actions or the information available to the actors.
Nevertheless, the potential consequences of herding, and how observers should interpret
others’ actions depends on that underlying driving force. For instance, if herding is
information-driven, then herding behavior would not have the destabilizing effect on
prices that is often attributed to it. Moreover, investors should rationally update their
priors based on others’ actions if they do indeed contain new information.
On the other hand, if herding is driven largely by a desire to imitate the actions of
others, then herding forces may move prices away from fundamentals. Trueman (1994)
presents an example where analysts herd to imitate other analysts. In Trueman’s model,
analysts’ compensation depends on their abilities as perceived by their clients. Trueman
shows that analysts with low abilities issue earnings forecasts that are close to those
announced by other analysts in order to mimic high ability analysts and get a bigger
compensation. Truman notes that in his model, “analysts exhibit herding behavior,

2

whereby they release forecasts similar to those previously announced by other analysts,
even when this is not justified by their information” (p. 97).
Herding for the sake of imitation could potentially introduce noise in prices,
which in turn may contribute to excess volatility that many view as undesirable.
However, here again herding per se would not lead to excess volatility if the users of the
information are aware of the herding incentives, and take those incentives into account in
their trading decisions. For instance, in Trueman (1994), although the earnings forecasts
are biased, they bring new information to the market. The bias would mislead investors
about the value of the stock only if they take the forecast at face value. But, if the
investors correctly adjust for the herding bias in earnings forecasts, then this bias would
not translate into pricing errors. Therefore, to understand the broader consequences of
any herding behavior, it is important that we not only focus on whether or not analysts or
others herd, but also investigate whether the market recognizes the herding phenomenon,
and acts accordingly.
This paper examines whether sell-side analysts herd when they make stock
recommendations. We develop a simple model that allows us to specifically examine
whether any herding behavior is driven by a desire to imitate. In addition, our model also
allows us to draw inferences about whether the market recognizes analysts’ tendencies to
deviate or conform at the time they make recommendation revisions. While the
phenomenon of herding has been examined in a variety of contexts in the literature, this
paper is the first to investigate whether the market recognizes herding behavior.3

3

For instance, Graham (1999), Jaffe and Mahoney (1999), Desai et al. (2000), Hong et al. (2000), Welch
(2000) and Clement and Tse (2005) examine herding among stock analysts and newsletters. Lamont (2002)
and Gallo, Granger and Jeon (2002) examine herding among macroeconomic forecasters and Chevalier and
Ellison (1999) examine herding among mutual fund managers.

3

In related work, Welch (2000) examines whether analysts herd when they make
investment recommendations. He develops a statistical model to investigate herding, and
he finds that analysts are more likely to revise their recommendations towards prior
consensus recommendations than away from them. However, as he notes, “Lacking
access to the underlying information flow, I [Welch] cannot discern if the influence of
recent revisions is either a similar response by multiple analysts to the same underlying
information or is caused by direct mutual imitation” [Welch (2000), p. 393].
In contrast, our paper empirically differentiates between imitation and
information-based herding. While Welch’s tests are based on the likelihoods of
recommendation revisions either moving towards or away from consensus, our tests are
based on market price reactions to recommendation revisions. Therefore, we are able to
not only test whether analysts herd without any assumptions about recommendation
transition probabilities, but we are also able to draw inferences about whether the market
recognizes analysts’ herding tendencies.
Empirically differentiating between herding due to imitation and herding due to
common information is generally difficult because they are both observationally similar
in many respects. This difficulty is amply illustrated by the empirical literature that
examines whether analysts herd towards the consensus when they issue forecasts. Early
papers by Hong, Kubik and Solomon (2000), Lamont (2002), Gallo, Granger and Jeon
(2002) and Clement and Tse (2005) examine the clustering of earnings or
macroeconomic forecasts around consensus forecasts, and draw the conclusion that
analysts herd towards the consensus, consistent with the model of Trueman (1994),
Scharfstein and Stein (1990) and others. De Bondt and Forbes (1999) find similar results

4

using UK data. However, these papers do not adequately account for the fact that
analysts may cluster around the consensus because both the consensus and the individual
analyst’s forecast reflect similar information, and because analysts may attempt to extract
and use information from the forecasts of others when they update their own forecasts.
Subsequent papers by Zitzewtiz (2001), Bernhardt, Campello and Kutsoati
(2006), and Chen and Jiang (2006) investigate herding behavior using methodologies that
specifically account for such information effects. In marked contrast with earlier studies,
these papers conclude that analysts “anti-herd,” or that they issue forecasts that are away
from the consensus relative to a forecast conditional on analysts’ information set at the
time of the forecast. For instance, Bernhardt et al. report that if an analyst’s revised
forecast is above the consensus then it is more likely that the forecast would overshoot
actual earnings than it would fall short of it, and the opposite is true when an analyst’s
revised forecast is below the consensus.
We present a simple model that captures analysts’ potential incentives to herd or
exaggerate their differences with the consensus. In our model, analysts optimally revise
their stock recommendations based on their private information, and the market prices
efficiently reflect all publicly available information including consensus
recommendations and analysts’ recommendation revisions. We show that price reactions
to analysts’ recommendation revisions are unrelated to consensus recommendations if
analysts optimally revise their recommendations solely based on new information,
without attempting to imitate other analysts’ old recommendations. We also show that
stock price reactions would be positively related to how far analysts’ new

5

recommendations deviate from the consensus if analysts have an incentive to herd and
negatively related if analysts have a disincentive to herd.
We use the results of our model to investigate whether analysts tend to herd or
anti-herd when they revise their stock recommendations. We also examine the relation
between analysts’ tendency to herd and their experience and the reputation of their
employer. Theoretical models by Trueman (1994) and Scharfstein and Stein (1990)
predict that analysts with lower reputation are more likely to herd because of career
concerns or because of their desire to imitate others with better abilities. In contrast,
Prendergast and Stole’s (1996) model predicts that inexperienced analysts are more likely
to exaggerate their differences so that they stand out from the crowd and appear talented.4
The empirical results in the literature offer mixed support for the predictions of
these models. Chevalier and Ellison (1999), Hong et al. (2000), and Clement and Tse
(2005) present results that suggest less experienced analysts are more likely to herd.
However, Zitzewitz (2001) presents tests that control for information effects and shows
that less experienced analysts actually exaggerate their differences from the consensus.
Unlike these papers, our tests are based on market’s interpretation of any relation
between herding and reputation, and our results offer a different perspective.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model that
lays the foundation for our empirical tests. Section 3 describes the data and Section 4
presents the empirical tests. Section 5 concludes the paper.

4

Scharfstein and Stein (1990) also point out that analysts’ may earn wages that are higher than outside
alternatives for experienced analysts, which could enhance the herding incentives.

2. Model
This section presents the model that provides the basis for our empirical tests. Our
model has two periods, 0 and 1. Suppose the price of a stock at time 0 is P0 . Consider a
sell-side analyst who makes investment recommendation about this stock. The
unconditional distribution of the stock price at time 1 is given by:
P1 = P0 + ε , where ε ~ N (0, σ ε2 )

(1)

The sell-side analyst observes a private noisy signal. He updates his priors about
the time 1 price for the stock, and his posterior S0 , conditional on his signal is:
S0 = P1 + η ,

(2)

where, η is noise, and η ~ N (0, σ η2 ) . The distribution of ε and η are common
knowledge.5
After the analyst observes his private signal, he has to decide whether to upgrade,
downgrade or make no revision to his investment recommendation of the stock. First,
consider a situation where there is no incentive for herding. Suppose the analyst’s
compensation C is a function of the relation between the direction of future price and the
direction of his recommendation revision. Specifically, his compensation is:

C = α + β ⋅ D − γ ⋅ (1 − D),

(3)

where D = 1 if future price change for the stock is in the same direction as the analyst’s
recommendation revision, and 0 otherwise. The parameters α , β , and γ are positive
constants. Since the compensation function rewards skill, the analyst should not have an
incentive to make a revision based on no information. Therefore, the penalty for a wrong

5

Our main results obtain also when we assume that only the analyst knows the precision of his signal, and
not the market.

7

call exceeds the reward for a correct call, i.e. β < γ . If he makes no revisions, his
compensation would be α , which is known at time 0.
The analyst revises his recommendation only if the expected payoff conditional
on a revision exceeds α . The proposition below describes the analyst’s optimal rule for
recommendation revision.
Proposition 1a: The analyst’s optimal recommendation revision rule is:
Upgrade if S 0 ≥ P0 + kσ η ;

Downgrade if S 0 ≤ P0 − kσ η ; and
No revision otherwise.

(4)

where k is determined by the equation
Φ (k ) =

γ
(β + γ )

,

(5)

and Φ is the cumulative standard normal distribution function.
Proof: See Appendix.
If the analyst revises his recommendation, then the market rationally incorporates that
information into prices. The proposition below presents the market price conditional on a
recommendation revision.
Proposition 1b: The stock price conditional on an upgrade is:
P0, up | Upgrade = P0 + σ εη

φ[k ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]
⎡⎣1 − Φ[k ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]⎤⎦

P0, down | Downgrade = P0 − σ εη

; and

φ[k ⋅ (ση σ εη )]
⎡⎣1 − Φ[k ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]⎤⎦

(6)

where φ is the standard normal density function, , and σ εη = σ ε2 + σ η2 .
Proof: See Appendix.
8

In our model, the analyst conveys his information through an upgrade or a
downgrade. Because our model assumes market efficiency, the particular label that the
analyst attaches to the recommendation per se, i.e. whether it is a buy, a hold or a sell,
does not convey any incremental information. Essentially, P0 incorporates all public
information including the analyst’s recommendation level prior to any revision.
Empirical evidence in Jegadeesh and Kim (2006) and others indicates that
recommendation levels do not contain any information about future returns and supports
this assumption.6
Now, consider the case where the analyst has either an incentive or a disincentive
to herd with the consensus. We incorporate any incentives or disincentives to herd in the
analyst’s compensation function, which we specify as:
C = α + β ⋅ D − γ ⋅ (1 − D) − δ ( Recnew − Consensus) 2 ,

(7)

where Recnew is the analyst’s new recommendation level and Consensus is the average
recommendation level of all the other analysts. If he makes no revisions, his
compensation would be C = α − δ ( Recold − Consensus) 2 .
The compensation function (7) is a reduced form characterization of the
incentives to herd or to exaggerate differences, and it is similar to the objective function
that Zitzewitz (2001) uses in the context of analysts’ earnings forecasts. Incentives to
herd arise endogenously in Trueman (1994), and Ehrbeck and Waldmann (1996). In these
models, analysts herd to mimic their more skilled counterparts. It is also possible that
analysts herd because they perceive it to be a safe course of action. After all, if their

In unreported results, we found that recommendation levels are not related to future returns in our sample
as well, and hence any information in recommendation levels is fully reflected in stock prices.

9

predictions turn out to be wrong when they herd, then their cohorts would be wrong as
well. Regardless of the underlying reason, when analysts have an incentive to herd, δ > 0
in the analyst’s compensation function (7).
Prendergast and Stole (1996) present a model where the opposite incentives are
present. In their model, agents who have not yet established a reputation for themselves,
or the “newcomers,” overemphasize their own information and exaggerate their
differences with others to appear talented. Similarly, Ottaviani and Sorensen (2006) show
that when analysts view their tasks as a winner-take-all contest, then they have an
incentive to excessively differentiate their views from those of other analysts. When
analysts were faced with incentives to deviate from the crowd, or to “anti-herd”, δ < 0 .
The proposition below describes the analyst’s optimal rule for recommendation
revision when his compensation function is given by (7).
Proposition 2a: The analyst’s optimal recommendation revision rule is:
Upgrade if S 0 ≥ P0 + (k + θ )σ η ;
Downgrade if S 0 ≤ P0 − (k + θ )σ η ; and
No revision otherwise.

(8)

where θ is determined by the equation
Φ(k + θ ) =

γ
(β + γ )

+

δ [( Recnew − Consensus ) 2 − ( Recold − Consensus ) 2 ]
. (9)
(β + γ )

Proof: See Appendix.
Now the analyst’s decision whether to revise his recommendation depends not only on
his signal but also on how far away his recommendation would be from the consensus.
Since the market rationally recognizes these incentives, the price reaction subsequent to a

10

revision would reflect the analyst’s decision rule. The proposition below presents the
market price conditional on a recommendation revision.
Proposition 2b: The stock price conditional on an upgrade is:
P0,up | Upgrade = P0 + σ εη

φ[(k + θ ) ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]
[1 − Φ[(k + θ ) ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]] ; and

P0,up | Downgrade = P0 − σ εη

φ[(k + θ ) ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]
[1 − Φ[(k + θ ) ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]]

(10)

Proof: See Appendix.
When there are incentives or disincentives to herd, the market price reaction is a
function of not only whether the analyst upgrades or downgrades his recommendation,
but also how far the recommendation is from the consensus. This relation is formally
described in the proposition below.
Proposition 3a: The price reaction to recommendation revision is stronger when, relative
to the old recommendation, the new recommendation moves away from the consensus
than when it moves towards the consensus if the analyst has an incentive to herd (i.e. if

δ > 0 ).
Proof: See Appendix.
Proposition 3b: The expected return following recommendation revision is:
(a) Positively related to the deviation between the analyst’s recommendation and the
consensus if the analyst has an incentive to herd (i.e. if δ > 0 ); and
(b) Negatively related to the deviation between the analyst’s recommendation and the
consensus if the analyst has an incentive to deviate from the herd (i.e. if δ < 0 ).
Proof: See Appendix.

11

Proposition 3a and 3b form the basis for our empirical tests. Our tests use market price
reactions to investigate herding. In contrast, prior research on herding typically attempts
to set empirical benchmarks for how agents would behave in the absence of herding. For
instance, Chevalier and Ellison (1999) report that less experienced managers deviate less
from benchmark index than more experienced managers, and conclude that less
experienced managers herd more because of career concerns. Here the experienced
managers’ deviation from the index is used as a benchmark for the less experienced
managers. However, it is quite possible that less experienced analysts stay closer to the
benchmark because they are not as talented as the more experienced managers. As this
example illustrates, when there are differences across agents in skill or in access to
information, it is difficult specify how one set of agents should behave based on the
actions of another set of agents and draw reliable inferences about herding.
Since we base our tests on market price reactions, we rely on market efficiency
and we do not need to specify a model that focuses on the transition probabilities for
recommendation revisions. Our model predicts that if recommendation revisions are
driven solely by new information, then market price reaction would not depend on the
distance between the consensus and new recommendations.

3. Data and Sample

We obtain the stock recommendations data from the IBES detailed US
recommendations file; earnings announcement dates from the IBES actual earnings file;
and stock returns and index returns from daily CRSP. The sample period is from
November 1993 to December 2005.

12

Most commonly, analyst recommendations rate stocks as “strong buy,” “buy,”
“hold,” “sell,” and “strong sell.”' Analysts also use other labels such as “market
underperform” and “market outperform,” or “underweight” and “overweight,” to convey
their opinions, but IBES standardizes the recommendations, and converts them to
numerical scores where “1” is strong buy, “2”' is buy, and so on. To map an upgrade to a
positive number and a downgrade to a negative number, we reverse IBES’ numerical
scores so that “1” would correspond to a strong sell and “5” would correspond to a strong
buy.
Our sample comprises all stocks that satisfy the following criteria:
(a)

There should be at least one analyst who issues a recommendation for the
stock and revises the recommendation within 180 calendar days7.

(b)

At least two analysts, other than the revising analyst, should have active
recommendations for the stock as of the day before the revision.

(c)

The stock return data on the recommendation revision date should be available
on CRSP; and

(d)

The stock price should be at least $1 on the day before the recommendation
revision date.

(e)

Recommendation revisions should be only one level up or down. That is,
absolute difference between the previous recommendation and the new
recommendation level should be one. For instance, we exclude all revisions
where analysts upgrade from hold to strong buy because the revision spans

7

IBES also provides stopped dates of the coverage for each stock and brokerage pair. We filter out
revisions that are made after the closest stopped date since the previous recommendation.

13

two levels, buy and strong buy. We impose this exclusion criterion to ensure
consistency with our model.8,9
Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the sample. The number of firms in
the sample ranges from a low of 139 in 1993 to a high of 1,783 in 2002. The sample size
is relatively small in 1993 largely because IBES coverage is incomplete in its first year.
The median number of analysts following a firm over the entire sample period is five.
The number of brokerages in database increases from 32 in 1993 to 145 in 2004 before
decreasing to 140 in 2005. The brokerages in the sample range from large brokerages like
Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley to small ones that have only one analyst on IBES. The
median number of analysts in a brokerage is four.

4. Empirical Tests

Our first set of tests examines stock price changes following recommendation
upgrades and downgrades over various horizons. We use the results from our model to
investigate whether stock price reactions to analysts’ recommendation revisions indicate
herding behavior. We then examine the cross-sectional relation between experience and
reputation, and analysts’ tendency to herd. Finally, we examine the robustness of our
results to alternate test specifications.

4.1 Price Reaction to Recommendation Revisions
This subsection examines how stock prices react to recommendation revisions.
We characterize each revision as an upgrade or a downgrade by comparing the revised
8

Sorescu and Subrahmanyam(2006) report that the market reactions are stronger for two level revisions
than for one level revisions.
9
Our empirical results, however, do not change when we include multiple level revisions in the sample.

14

recommendation with the previous active recommendation for the stock by the revising
analyst.
After a recommendation revision for stock i on date t, we compute H-day buyand-hold abnormal returns ABRi (t , t + H ) as follows:
t+H

t+H

τ =t

τ =t

ABRi (t , t + H ) = Π (1 + Ri ,τ ) − Π (1 + Rm ,τ )

(11)

where, Ri ,τ and Rm,τ are the return on stock i and the value-weighted index return,
respectively.
Table 2 presents abnormal stock returns over various horizons following
recommendation revisions. Day 0 is the revision date and the other days in the column
headings are the number of trading days from the revision date. For instance, the entries
under the column heading “21” presents cumulative abnormal returns over 21 trading
days, or roughly one calendar month, after the revision. We compute serial-correlation
consistent Hansen and Hodrick standard error estimates allowing for non-zero serial
correlation for up to 6 months to take into account that the return measurement intervals
overlap across longer horizons.
The average abnormal return on the revision date is 2.03% for all upgrades and
- 3.14% for all downgrades. The abnormal return gradually increases to 4.85% by the end
of the sixth months for upgrades and decreases to –3.45% for downgrades. Therefore, a
large part of stock price response occurs on the day of the revision although the market
prices continue to reflect the information in recommendation revisions up to six months

15

into the future. These results are consistent with the previous literature that examines the
impact of analysts’ recommendations on stock prices.10
Table 2 also presents abnormal returns separately for recommendation revisions
that move towards the consensus and those that move away from the consensus. We
define consensus recommendation level as the equal-weighted average of all active
recommendations that are outstanding for the stock as of the day before the revision,
excluding the revising analysts’ recommendation. We include a revision in the sample
only if at least two analysts beside the revising analyst have active recommendations.
We consider a recommendation to be active for up to 180 days after it is issued or until
IBES stopped file records that the analyst has stopped issuing recommendations for that
stock. We impose the 180-day criterion to screen out stale recommendations. We
categorize a revision as moving away from the consensus if the absolute value of
deviation from the consensus is larger for the new recommendation than for the old
recommendation, and moving towards the consensus otherwise.11
The results in Table 2 indicate that the market reaction is stronger for revisions
that move away from the consensus than for those that move towards it. For upgrades,
the difference in abnormal returns is significant on the revision date. Because longer
horizon returns are noisier, we do not detect any reliable difference in returns over
horizon beyond two months. For downgrades, the differences between returns are much
larger and have a longer lasting effect. These results are consistent with the predictions
of our model under herding hypothesis and suggest that the market rationally takes into

10

For example, Womack (1996), Jegadeesh, Kim, Krische and Lee (2004) and Jegadeesh and Kim (2006).
In 985 revisions (2% of the sample), the absolute deviation is the same before and after the revision. We
exclude these revisions when we present stock price reactions in Table 2 for revisions that move away from
or towards the consensus.

11

16

account the herding incentives of sell side analysts when they make recommendation
revisions and prices them accordingly.
However, the analysis in this subsection considers only a binary classification of
potential indication of herding; movement towards or away from the consensus. Our
model also provides predictions regarding the relationship between the magnitude of the
move towards or away from the consensus and expected returns, which we expect to be
more powerful in testing the herding hypothesis. We now examine these predictions in
more detail.

4.2 Herding Regressions
We use the following regression specification to investigate whether analysts herd:
ABRi (t , t + H ) = a H + bH × I + c H × ( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 ) + ε i , j ,t , H

(12)

where,
I = +1 if the revision is an upgrade
= -1 if the revision is a downgrade
The indicator variable I takes the sign of expected abnormal returns conditional
on an upgrade or a downgrade. We use this indicator variable so that we can pool
upgrades and downgrades in the same regression.
The variable New _ reci , j ,t is the recommendation level after the revision for stock
i by analyst j on day t. If there are multiple revisions on any day t for stock i, then we
treat each revision as a separate observation.12 The variable Con _ reci ,t −1 is the

12

About 7% of the sample are related with multiple revisions on a same day.

17

consensus recommendation the day before the revision, excluding the revising analyst’s
recommendation.
This regression specification is based on the results of our model given in
Equation (9) and (10). As Equation (9) and (10) indicate, if analysts were either herding
or exaggerating their differences, then the stock return on the revision date would not
only depend on the information in the revision per se, but also on whether the
recommendation is closer to or away from the consensus recommendation. As we discuss
in Proposition 3b, stock price reaction would be positively related to the deviation from
the consensus if analysts herd, and would be negatively related if they exaggerate.13
Therefore, our alternate hypotheses are:
A1. Herding: Analysts have an incentive to herd close to the consensus when they
make recommendation revisions. Therefore, c > 0 .
A2. Exaggeration: Analysts have an incentive to exaggerate their differences with
the consensus when they make recommendation revisions. Therefore, c < 0 .
For convenience, we will be referring to c as the herding coefficient in the
subsequent analysis. We fit Regression (12) for holding periods ranging from one day to
about six-months. By allowing for holding period longer than just the day of revision, we
can examine whether market reaction recognizes any herding incentives on the revision
date or with some delay. For instance, if analysts tend to herd, but the immediate market
reaction does not take herding into account, then the coefficient c would be zero on the
revision date but it would be positive over longer horizons as the information in deviation

We resort to ( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 ) as the main explanatory variable rather than directly use
2
2
[( New _ rec i , j ,t −l − Con _ rec i ,t ) - (Old _ rec i , j ,t −l − Con _ reci ,t ) ] * I , since this quantity is equivalent
to 2( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 ) − I when revisions are only one level up or down.

18

from consensus gets reflected in market prices. However, if coefficient c is not different
from zero over any holding period, then we would not be able to reject the null
hypothesis of no herding or exaggeration.
Table 3 presents the estimates of Regression (12) using the Fama-MacBeth
approach. Specifically, we estimate a separate regression using all revision data within
each calendar quarter. The regression estimates and t-stats are based on the time-series
averages and standard errors of the corresponding quarterly regression coefficients.
There are a total of 49,255 revisions in our sample. The slope coefficient on the
revision indicator on day 0 is 2.05, indicating that the average stock return is 2.05% in the
direction of recommendation revision. This slope coefficient increases gradually with the
holding period, reflecting the delay in market price reactions to recommendation
revisions.
The slope coefficient on deviation from consensus is .75, which is significantly
positive. Therefore, in addition to the direction of recommendation revision, the deviation
from consensus also conveys information to the market. The stock return is more positive
for upgrades and more negative for downgrades when the new recommendation moves
farther away from the consensus than when it moves closer to it. As we discussed earlier,
the positive coefficient supports the hypothesis that analysts herd towards the consensus.
The point estimates of the slope coefficients on deviation from consensus are .70
and .88 for two- and six-month holding periods, respectively. Although these point
estimates are smaller and larger than the corresponding slope coefficient on the revision
date return regression, the differences are not statistically significant. Therefore, the

19

market price fully incorporates the information in the deviation from consensus on the
revision date.
Analysts’ tendency to herd may be different for upgrades and downgrades. For
instance, analysts may be more reluctant to stand out from the herd for downgrades since
they are typically reluctant to be negative on a stock.14 To investigate whether analysts
herd differently for upgrades versus downgrades, we fit the following regression:
ABRi (t , t + H ) = a H + bH × I + c H × ( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 )
+ d H × ( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 ) × downgrade _ dummyi , j ,t + ε i , j ,t , H (13)
where downgrade_dummyi,j,t equals 1 for downgrades and 0 for upgrades.
Table 4 reports the regression estimates. The slope coefficient on the herding
coefficients for downgrade dummy is .90, which is significantly greater than zero.
Therefore, analysts tend to herd more for downgrades than for upgrades.

4.3 Cross-Sectional Determinants of Herding
This subsection examines the factors that are related to analysts’ tendency to herd.
In the models of Scharfstein and Stein (1990) inexperienced agents are more likely to
herd because of career concerns. In contrast, Prendergast and Stole (1996) present a
model where “newcomers” exaggerate their differences more than well established
employees in order to stand out from the crowd and appear talented. Empirical evidence
offers mixed support for these predictions. For example, Hong et al. (2000), Clement and
Tse (2005), and Chevalier and Ellison (1999) find that less experienced analysts and
mutual fund managers are more likely to herd. On the other hand, Zitzewitz (2001)
14

Analysts’ reluctance to issue negative opinion is evident in the distribution of their recommendations. For
example, Barber, LeHavy, McNichols and Trueman (2001) report that only 5.7% of the analysts’
recommendations in their sample were sell or strong sell.

20

reports that more experienced analysts are more likely to herd when they make earnings
forecasts, after accounting for information effects. This subsection uses price reactions to
analysts’ recommendation revisions to investigate analysts’ tendency to herd from the
market’s perspective.
We use two measures of analysts’ professional reputation. The first measure is the
length of time that the analyst is on the IBES database. The second measure is the size of
the brokerage that employs the analyst since larger brokerages are more established and
prestigious. We measure the size of the brokerage by the number of analysts who are on
the IBES database from that brokerage each year.
We also examine the relation between analysts’ tendency to herd and the
dispersion of analysts’ outstanding recommendation prior to the revision. We expect that
if recommendations are dispersed analysts will have less of an incentive to herd because
they do not stand out as much when their opinion deviates from the average.
We use the following regression to test the relation between herding and various
characteristics:
ABRi (t , t + H ) = a H + bH × I + c H × ( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 )
+ d H × ( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 ) × char _ dummyi , j ,t
+ e H × I × char _ dummyi , j ,t + ε i , j ,t , H

(14)

where char _ dummyi , j ,t is a dummy variable for each characteristic. The dummy variable
for analysts’ experience equals 1 if the analyst has more than three years of experience.
The dummy variable for brokerage reputation equals 1 if the number of analyst is
employed by a top 20 brokerage the previous year, based on the number of analysts
employed by the brokerage. The cross-sectional dispersion dummy equals 1 if the

21

standard deviation of the consensus recommendation prior to the revision is greater than
0.75, which is the average dispersion in the sample. 15 We also include an additional
independent variable that interacts each dummy variable with I to examine whether the
characteristic directly affects market response to recommendation revisions.
Table 5 reports the estimates of regression (14). Panels A, B, and C report results
for analyst experience, brokerage size, and pre-revision dispersion in recommendations,
respectively. The results from panel A indicate that the tendency to herd does not differ
across analysts depending on their experience.16 In contrast, Clement and Tse (2005) and
Zitzewitz (2001) find evidence of herding and anti-herding when analysts revise their
earnings forecasts.
Panel B uses brokerage size as a measure of reputation. The herding coefficient
on brokerage size dummy is significantly positive, which indicates that analysts from
large brokerages tend to herd more than analysts from small brokerages. This finding
suggests that analysts from the less prestigious brokerage may try to stand out from the
crowd to attract attention, and it is consistent with the predictions of Prendergast and
Stole (1996).
Panel C examines the relation between cross-sectional dispersion in
recommendations and analysts’ tendency to herd. The herding coefficient of the
dispersion dummy is significantly negative, which indicates that analysts are less likely to
herd when there is a large dispersion across analysts’ opinion. This result is consistent
with our prediction.

15

The sample mean of cross-sectional dispersion in recommendations is 0.75 and the median is 0.753.
The sub-sample used in panel A only includes those revisions that are made at least three years after the
beginning of the sample period so that we have at least a three-year history of employment.
16

22

4.4 Robustness Check
This subsection examines the robustness of our results to various changes in our
sample selection criteria. Analysts use a variety of different information when they arrive
at their recommendations. For instance, Ivkovic and Jegadeesh (2004) note that analysts’
recommendations immediately following earnings announcements are likely to be based
on their interpretation of financial data that the firm announces while their
recommendations at other times are likely to be based on information that they privately
gather.
To examine whether analysts’ tendency to herd differs depending on the timing of
their revisions, we estimate regression (12) excluding revisions made within three days
before and after the earnings announcement date. Panel A of Table 6 presents the
regression estimates.17 We find that the herding coefficients now are quite similar to the
estimates we report in Table 3 for the full sample.
It is possible that revisions made by two analysts close to one another are driven
by common information. Therefore, we re-estimate regression (12) for a sample of
revisions that are made at least five days after the most recent revision by a different
analyst. These results are also quite similar to the full sample results.
Next, we exclude revisions that move across the consensus. For example, if an
analyst upgrades from 3 to 4 when the consensus is 3.3 it may not be an unambiguous
move away from the consensus. Panel C of Table 6 presents the regression estimates for
this restricted subsample. Here again, the results are quite similar to the full sample
results both in magnitude and significance of the coefficients.

17

We lose roughly a quarter of our sample when we exclude the seven-day earnings announcement window
since analysts’ recommendation revisions tend to cluster within this event window.

23

Finally, we investigate the possibility that the herding coefficient is significant not
because of the deviation from consensus, but because of the information contained in the
new recommendation level. To examine this possibility, we fit the following regression:
ABRi (t , t + H ) = a H + bH × I + c H × ( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 )
+ d H × Sell _ StrongSelli , j ,t + e H × StrongBuyi , j ,t + ε i , j ,t , H

(15)

where Sell _ StrongSelli , j ,t is a dummy variable equal to1 if the new recommendation is a
sell or a strong sell and 0 otherwise, and StrongBuyi , j ,t is a dummy variable equal to1 if
the new recommendation is a strong buy and 0 otherwise.
Table 7 presents the estimates of regression (15). The slope coefficient on the
Sell _ StrongSell dummy is significantly positive on the revision date, while that on
the StrongBuy , is significantly negative. These results indicate that downgrades or
upgrades to these levels are less informative than others. However, the herding
coefficient is significantly positive, and of similar magnitude to the corresponding
coefficients in Table 3. Therefore the information contained in the deviation from the
consensus is orthogonal to the level of recommendations.

5. Conclusions

This paper examines whether sell-side analysts herd when they make stock
recommendations. We develop a model that allows us to specifically examine whether
any herding behavior is driven by a desire to imitate. In addition, our model allows us to
draw inferences about whether the market recognizes analysts’ tendencies to deviate from
or conform to the consensus at the time they make recommendation revisions. While the

24

phenomenon of herding has been examined in a variety of contexts in the literature, this
paper is the first to investigate whether the market recognizes herding behavior.
We find that the market reaction to analysts’ recommendation revision is stronger
when the revised recommendations move away from the consensus than when they move
towards the consensus. Our results are robust to a variety of controls. Our results indicate
that recommendation revisions are partly driven by analysts’ desire to herd with the
crowd.
We find stronger herding effects for downgrades than for upgrades, which
suggests that analysts are more reluctant to stand out from the crowd when they convey
negative information. We also find that analysts from more reputed brokerages are more
likely to herd than analysts from less reputed brokerages. This finding supports the
prediction of Prendergast and Stole (1996) that “new comers,” which in our context
represents analysts from less prestigious brokerages, are more likely to stand out from the
crowd than well established agents.
Media accounts and some academic papers have suggested that analysts’ herding
tendencies could introduce noise into prices because the market could potentially
overweight the common mistakes of the herd. However, our results indicate that the
market anticipates analysts’ tendencies to herd, and the market price reaction on the
revision date accounts for such herding tendencies. Therefore, we doubt that herding by
analysts when they make recommendations would have any destabilizing effect on prices.

optimally upgrades his recommendation when S 0 > P0 + kσ η . The optimal rule for
issuing downgrades can be similarly determined.

From the market’s perspective, S 0 = P0 + ε + η so that S 0 ~ N ( P0 , σ ε2 + σ η2 ) .
Then, based on the properties of the normal distribution, it can be shown that,
φ[k ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]
E ( S 0 |S 0 > P0 + kσ η ) = P0 + σ εη λ [k ⋅ (σ η σ εη )] = P0 + σ εη

Similarly, the expected stock price conditional on observing a downgrade is given by;

E ( S 0 |S 0 < P0 − kσ η ) = P0 − σ εη λ [k ⋅ (σ η σ εη )] = P0 − σ εη

Proof of Proposition 2a
Let X = Pr[ P1 > P0 | S 0 ] . Now, the analyst issues an upgrade if:

α + ( β + γ ) X − γ − δ ( Recnew − Consensus) 2 > α − δ ( Recold − Consensus) 2

(A.8)

Therefore,

Since P1 | S 0 ~ N ( S 0 , σ η2 ) , Eq. (A.10) implies that

analysts upgrades his recommendation when S0 > P0 + (k + θ )ση . The optimal rule for
downgrades can be similarly determined.
Proof of Proposition 2b
The expected stock price conditional on observing an upgrade is now given by;
P0,up | Upgrade = E ( S 0 |S 0 > P0 + (k + θ )σ η ) =

∞

∫S

f ( S 0 |S 0 > P0 + (k + θ )σ η )dS 0 (A.11)

p0 + ( k +θ k )σ η

By Proposition 1b, it follows that,
E ( S 0 |S 0 > P0 + (k + θ )σ η ) = P0 + σ εη λ [(k + θ ) ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]
= P0 + σ εη

φ[(k + θ ) ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]
[1 − Φ[(k + θ ) ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]]

(A.12)

Similarly, the expected stock price conditional on a downgrade is:
E ( S 0 |S 0 < P0 − (k + θ )σ η ) = P0 − σ εη λ [(k + θ ) ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]
= P0 − σ εη

φ[(k + θ ) ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]
[1 − Φ[(k + θ ) ⋅ (σ η σ εη )]]

(A.13)

Proof of Proposition 3a
A move away from the consensus implies that
[( Recnew − Consensus) 2 − ( Recold − Consensus) 2 ] is positive. Suppose that analysts have
incentives to herd so that δ > 0 . Then, from Eq. (A.10), θ > 0 . Similarly, a movement

29

towards the consensus implies that θ < 0. Based on the properties of normal distribution,
it follows that,

λ ' (α ) = λ (α )[λ (α ) − α ] ∈ (0,1) .

(A.14)

Thus, according to Eq. (A.12) and (A.13), positive θ implies a higher expected price for
upgrades and a lower expected price for downgrades and negative θ leads to a lower
expected price for upgrades and a higher expected price for downgrades

Proof of Proposition 3b
Let
∆ = ( Recnew − Recold ) ,

(A.15)

Deviation = ( Recnew − Consensus) .

(A.16)

and

Then, it follows that
[( Recnew − Consensus) 2 − ( Recold − Consensus) 2 ] = ∆[2 ⋅ Deviation − ∆ ]

(A.17)

For upgrades, Deviation would increase as the analyst first moves towards the consensus
and then away from it for given levels of ∆ and Consensus. Since ∆ > 0 , an increases in
Deviation implies an increase in [( Recnew − Consensus) 2 − ( Recold − Consensus) 2 ] . From
Eq. (A.10), this implies an increase θ when δ > 0 . It follows from Eq. (A.12) and
(A.14) that an increase in θ implies a higher expected price.

For downgrades, Deviation would decrease as the analyst first moves towards the
consensus and then away from it. Since ∆ < 0 , a decrease in Deviation implies an
increase in [( Recnew − Consensus) 2 − ( Recold − Consensus) 2 ] . Then, based on Eq. (A.10),
(A.13) and (A.14), this implies increases in θ and a lower expected price when δ > 0 .

Thus, Deviation and expected returns would be positively related for both upgrades and
downgrades. The opposite result obtains when analysts have incentives to anti-herd (i.e.
if δ < 0 ).

Table 2
Cumulative Market-Adjusted Returns following Analysts’ Recommendation Revisions
This table presents the cumulative abnormal returns (in %) following recommendation revisions. We characterize each revision as an
upgrade or a downgrade by comparing the revised recommendation with the previous active recommendation for the stock by the revising
analyst. Within upgrades and downgrades, we further classify them into revisions that move towards the consensus and those that move
away from it. Consensus is the average of all outstanding recommendations with at least two analysts following the stock as of the day
before the revision, excluding the revising analyst. A revision is categorized as moving towards the consensus if the absolute value of
deviation from consensus is larger for the new recommendation than for the old recommendation. The abnormal return is the raw return
minus the CRSP value-weighted index return. Day 0 is the revision date and the other days in the column headings are the number of trading
days from the revision date. The average returns reported in bold face are statistically significant at least at the five percent level (absolute
value of t-statistics greater than 1.96). We use heteroskedasticity and serial correlation consistent standard errors to compute the t-statistics.
The sample period is November 1993 to December 2005.

Table 4
Regressions Testing for Herding: Upgrades vs. Downgrades
This table reports the estimates of the following regression:

ABRi (t , t + H ) = a H + bH × I + c H × ( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 )
+ d H × ( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 ) × downgrade _ dummyi , j ,t + ε i , j ,t , H
where t is the forecast revision date, ABRi (t , t + H ) is the H-period abnormal return following the revision date, I is the indicator variable for
upgrades ( I = +1) and downgrades ( I = −1) , New _ reci , j ,t is the revised individual recommendation on date t, Con _ reci ,t −1 is the

consensus recommendation the day before the revision excluding the revising analyst’s recommendation, and downgrade_dummyi,j,t equals 1
for downgrades and 0 for upgrades. We estimate the regression coefficients and the standard errors using quarterly Fama-MacBeth
regressions. The sample period is November 1993 to December 2005.

Table 5
Cross Sectional Variation in Herding
This table reports the estimates of the following cross sectional regression:

ABRi (t , t + H ) = a H + bH × I + c H × ( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 )
+ d H × ( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 ) × char _ dummyi , j ,t + e H × I × char _ dummyi , j ,t + ε i , j ,t , H
where t is the forecast revision date, ABRi (t , t + H ) is the H-period abnormal return following the revision date, I is the indicator variable for
upgrades ( I = +1) and downgrades ( I = −1) , New _ reci , j ,t is the revised individual recommendation on date t and Con _ reci ,t −1 is the

consensus recommendation the day before the revision excluding the revising analyst’s recommendation . The char _ dummyi , j ,t in Panel A
equals 1 if the analyst has more than three years of experience, and zero otherwise; in Panel B it equals 1 if the number of analysts employed
by the brokerage is one of the top 20 the previous year, and zero otherwise; in Panel C it equals 1 if the standard deviation of the consensus
recommendation prior to the revision is greater than 0.75, which is the average dispersion in the sample. We obtain the regression estimates
using quarterly Fama-MacBeth regressions. The sample period is November 1993 to December 2005.

Table 6
Robustness Checks
This table estimates average herding across multiple recommendation revisions for
various sub-samples. Panel A excludes all revisions made within a window three days before and
three days after the earnings announcement dates, panel B includes only those revisions that are
made at least five days after the most recent revision made by a different analyst, and panel C
excludes revisions that move across the consensus recommendation level. All specifications are
based on quarterly Fama-MacBeth regressions where the coefficient and t-stats are based on timeseries averages and standard errors and require at least two analysts with active recommendations
before the revision. The sample period is November 1993 to December 2005.

Table 7
Herding and Recommendation Levels
This table reports the estimates of the following cross sectional regression:

ABRi (t , t + H ) = a H + bH × I + c H × ( New _ reci , j ,t − Con _ reci ,t −1 ) + d H × Sell _ StrongSelli , j ,t + e H × StrongBuyi , j ,t + ε i , j ,t , H
where t is the forecast revision date, ABRi (t , t + H ) is the H-period abnormal return following the revision date, I is the indicator variable for

upgrades ( I = +1) and downgrades ( I = −1) , New _ reci , j ,t is the revised individual recommendation on date t and Con _ reci ,t −1 is the

consensus recommendation the day before the revision excluding the revising analyst’s recommendation. Sell _ StrongSelli , j ,t is a dummy
variable equal to1 if the new recommendation is a sell or a strong sell and 0 otherwise, and StrongBuy i , j ,t is a dummy variable equal to1 if the
new recommendation is a strong buy and 0 otherwise. We obtain the regression estimates using quarterly Fama-MacBeth regressions. The sample
period is November 1993 to December 2005.
