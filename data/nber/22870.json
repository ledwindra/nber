    "abstract": "\n\nWe examine the impact of ambiguity, or Knightian uncertainty, on the capital structure decision, using a static tradeoff theory model in which agents are both ambiguity and risk averse. The model confirms the well-known result that greater risk\u2014the uncertainty over outcomes\u2014leads firms to decrease leverage. Conversely, the model indicates that greater ambiguity\u2014the uncertainty over the probabilities associated with the outcomes\u2014leads firms to increase leverage. Using a theoretically based measure of ambiguity, our empirical analysis presents evidence consistent with these notions, showing that ambiguity has an important and distinct impact on capital structure.\n\n",
