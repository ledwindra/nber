    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper 'goes back to basics' in empirical analysis of the J-Curve.  First, we document strong violations in the distributional assumptions that underlie nearly all previous work on this issue.  Second, we employ distribution-free, non-parametric statistical tests to characterize the data and summarize the key relationships between real exchange rates, the current account, and real GDP.  We find some (weak) evidence of a J-Curve in the data.  Interestingly, however, we document that this evidence is not consistent with the standard theoretical explanation of the J-Curve.  Consequently, our empirical results pose a strong challenge for international economic theory.\n\n",
