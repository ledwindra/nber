On the Design of Contracts and Remedies for Breach

ABSTRACT

The implications of uncertainty for the design of contracts and of

remedies for their breach are studied. After characterizing complete
contingent contracts, incomplete contracts are examined. Specifically,
in view of difficulties in making contingent provisions (costs of enumeration and of bargaining; verification of occurrence of events), it is

shown for which contingencies provisions are made. Then, in the major
part of the paper, two important implicit substitute for contingent terms

are analyzed. The first is provided by remedies for breach of contract;
for when a party must pay damages for breach, he will be induced to fulfill
his obligations in approximately those contingencies which would have been

agreed upon under the terms of a detailed contract. The second substitute
for contingent terms lies in the opportunity for renegotiation in light
of circumstances, since renegotiation will occur in more or less those
contingencies where the contract terms would have differed under a more
detailed agreement.

On the Design of Contracts and Remedies for Breach

Steven Shavel1

The concern of this paper is with the implications of uncertainty
for the design of contracts and of remedies for their breach.1
tainty is of course an inherent feature of the contractual

Uncer—

relationship,

for by definition there is always a lapse of time between the making of

a contract and the promised performance. During that period the cost of

may unexpectedly increase, an offer to the buyer may be made
that is more advantageous than the seller's, or any number of other

production

problematic

the

contingencies may arise and may result in the seller's or

buyer's failure to perform.

Our analysis of the contractual situation will begin with. a consideration of agreements which provide explicitly for such problematic

contingencies. Specifically, a characterization will be given of contracts which are both complete--contain terms

regarding all possible

contingencies--and Pareto efficient--cannot be improved in the eyes of
the buyer and of the seller.

It will next be asked why contracts ordinarily should not be ex-

pected to approach true completeness. The explanation will be that
because of certain difficulties in making contingent provisions and also
of the existence of various substitutes for them, it is in the mutual
interests of the parties to leave many things unstated. Two types of
difficulty in making provisions will be emphasized in this explanation:
the Costs of enumerating and of bargaining over contingent arrangements;

and the necessity that a party be able to verify the occurrence of a
contingency claimed by the other party so that a provision depending on

the contingency is workable.2 In view of these difficulties, it will be
shown for which contingencies contractual provisions are made.

2

Then, in the major part of the paper, two important types of sub-

stitute for contingent terms in contracts will be studied. The first is
provided by legal or customary remedies for breach of contract, that is,
by rules requiring a party in breach to pay money damages to the other

party or perhaps requiring "specific performance." To see why remedies
serve as substitutes for contingent terms, consider, for instance, that
when a seller must pay damages if he defaults, he will be induced t.o do

so only if that still would be advantageous to him, say only if his

production costs were larger than he anticipated or he received a higher

bid than he expected from another party before he was to perform. But
that the seller not perform in such contingencies is probably what would
have been agreed to in provisions for them; and that the seller make a
payment might also have been agreed to in provisions so as to accomplish

a desirable sharing of risk. Thus, remedies for breach can serve as
implicit substitutes for explicit contractual provisions by creating
appropriate incentives to perform, and soi.etimes by allocating risk as

well. The second type of substitute for provisions for contingencies
lies si,mply in the opportunity for renegotiation in light of circum-

stance. The seller who finds that it would be expensive to perform
would usually be willing to pay an amount the buyer would accept for his
release; so, through bargaining ex post, the parties may achieve a

similar result to what they would have written into the contract. A
third type of substitute for contractual provisions should also be
mentioned, but it will only be adverted to in the paper; it is that
certain contingencies (notably, acts of God, force majeure) may already
be recognized in contract law (or trade practice or custom) as

excusing the obligations of one of the parties. 4

The paper will conclude with a brief comment on the interpretation
of the analysis.
I.

Outline of the Model

The concern is with two parties, a buyer and a seller, who each act
so as to maximize the expected utility of a single variable, "wealth"5

The parties are assumed already to have met6 and not to be immediately
able to make contracts with others; thus they will make a contract
themselves if doing so would result in a higher expected utility for
each than that of the alternative of not making any contract, and this

will generally be presumed to be the case. The elements of the contractual situation faced by the parties are described in Figure 1. That is,
in order to get the benefits of performance, the buyer must commit
certain resources before he learns whether the seller will carry out his

promise. (The buyer might have to hire and train men to be able to use
a machine that is to be delivered; he may have to advertise the expected

appearance of a singer at his nightclub; he may have to make various

arrangements in anticipation of going on a charter hunting trip.) The
amount of such resources is assumed fixed7 and will be referred to as

reliance expenditures, or simply as reliance.8 Let
r

=

reliance

and assume that it is positive.

After the buyer "relies," the seller learns the uncertain con-

tingency. In regard to production contracts, one of two types of contract to be studied, the uncertain contingency will be the seller's

production Cost. Let

probability density of c,

where f is assumed to be positive on a non-degenerate interval [ci,
with ci

J,

0, and to be zero elsewhere.9 The seller is assumed to learn

the production cost before he actually begins the production process.
In regard to contracts for transfer of possession, the other type of
contract, the contingency will be the value of a bid made by another

party for a good (an object of art; land) that the seller initially has

in his possession. Let
b

=

bid,

and let f (distributed on [ci, ]) stand for the probability density of b

as well.10 (The next section will discuss whether the buyer is aware of
the bids and would himself be able to sell the good to a bidder were the

seller to deliver it to him.) It will also be assumed that the seller
would get no value from conswnption of the good; if he does not sell the
good, its worth to him is zero.1'
If the seller satisfies his contractual obligation, that is, if he

"performs," the buyer will enjoy a benefit called the expectancy. Let
v

=

buyer's

expectancy,

a positive variable. (This would be interpreted as the enhancement in
profits (gross of reliance) due to delivery of the machine or the appearance of the singer; it would also be the monetary equivalent value
(gross of reliance) to the individual of going on his hunting trip; it
would be the value (gross of reliance) of the object of art or the-

parcel of land.) The net benefit if the buyer enjoys performance is v -

r.

The expectancy is assumed to be known to the parties with certain-

ty. 12

5

On the other hand, if the

seller

does not perform, the buyer does

not get his expectancy (so his position is -r), for it Is assumed that
the buyer is not able to purchase immediate substitute performance; the
contract good or service is not traded on a well-organized market.13

II. Pareto Efficient Complete Contingent Contracts
A.

The case where

parties

are risk neutral

In this subsection a complete contingent contract will mean an

enforceable agreement specifying whether or not the seller is to perform

under each contingency and specifying also a price. It will be assumed
that the price is paid when the contract is made and that no monetary
transfers are carried out thereafter.14 Accordingly, a complete con-

tingent contract may be formally identified with a breach set
the set of contingencies under which the seller will

B

not perform;

and with

k

the

=

contract price.

Now let us define

the expected value--exclusive of price--to the buyer

=
Eb(B)

of a contract with breach set B

the expected value--exclusive of price--to the

=
E5(B)

seller of a contract with breach set B.

Therefore, when price is taken into account, the expected positions of
the buyer and of the seller who have made a contract are, respectively,
Eb(B) - k and E(B) +

k.

It follows that a contract (B, k) is Pareto

efficient if there does not exist any other contract (B', k') under
which Eb(B') -

k'

>

Eb(B)

-

k and E(B') +

k'

>

E(B)

+ k.

We will

.,.15

denote the breach set of a Pareto efficient contract by B'.

Before

6

characterizing Pareto efficient complete contingent contracts of the
various types of interest to us, let us first state several facts about
such contracts in general)-6

Remark. A complete contingent contract is Pareto efficient if and
only
if it is described by either of the
following equivalent conditions.
(a) The sum of the buyer's and of the
maximized by the contract (i.e.,

seller's expected values is

Eb(B)+E (B) is maximized by B*).

(b) The sum of the buyer's and of the seller's values

each

contingency is maximized by the contract--the seller performs in a contingency if and only if that would increase or leave equal the sum.17
This implies

psition 1. Under a Pareto efficient production Contract, the seller
will not perform when production Cost exceeds the buyer's expectancy

(i.e., B {clc >

v}).

Note. The result may be explained

as follows. Suppose that the parties

Contemplated making a contract calling for the seller to perform in some
contingency where his cost c exceed the expectancy v. Then the seller

would be willing to accept a reduction in the contract price sufficient
to induce the buyer to

agree to change the contract so as to allow the

seller not to perform in the

contingency. Similarly, a contract allow-

ing the seller not to perform in a contingency where c <

v

would be

altered so as to require the seller to perform in the contingency.

These two statements are in turn true because there is a loss (in the
sum of values) if either the seller performs when c > v
or fails to
perform when c <

v.

Reliance r does not affect whether it is Pareto efficient for there
to be performance

because reliance is like a "sunk cost."

Proof. By part (b) of the Remark, it suffices to show that when c > v,
the sum of values is increased by failing to perform. Now if the seller
does

not perform, his wealth is k and the buyer's is - k -

is —

so the sum

If the seller does perform, his wealth is k - c and the buyer's

so the sum is v -

Hence the sum is increased by

c or when c > v.

Q.E.D.

In regard to contracts for transfer of possession, two situations

will be distinguished. In the first, it is assumed that bids b are made
only to the seller; they are not available to the buyer; were the good

delivered to him, the buyer could not then sell to the bidder.'8 By
contrast, in the second situation, it is assumed that bids are available
to the buyer; were the good delivered to him, the buyer could sell to
the bidder and would do so if v <

b.

In both situations it is assumed

for simplicity that if the seller does not perform and sells to the

bidder, then that is the end of the matter; the buyer does not attempt
to make a purchase from the bidder.19
Proposition 2.

(a) If bids are made only to the seller, then under a

Pareto efficient contract for transfer of possession, the seller will
not perform when the bid exceeds the expectancy (i.e., B*

bjb >v}).

However, (b) if bids are available to the buyer as well, then a contract
in which the seller always performs is Pareto efficient; and, more
-

generally,

any contract in which the seller performs at least whenever

the bid is less than or equal to the expectancy is Pareto efficient

(i.e., B can be any set which is included in {b b >

v}).

o

Note. Result (a) is analogous to Proposition 1, and is based on the

v

fact that if either the seller performs when b >
when b <

v,

or fails to perform

there is a loss in the sum of values. Result (b) is differ-

ent from (a) because under our assumptions there is no loss in the sum

of values if the seller performs when

b>v; for in that case the buyer

would himself sell to the bidder.

Proof. We again apply part (b) of the Remark.

To prove (a), note that

if the seller does not perform (selling instead to the bidder), his
wealth is k ÷ b and the buyer's is - k -

r,

so the sum is b -

seller does perform, his wealth is k and the buyer's is v - k
the sum is v b -

r

v

Hence the sum is increased by failing to perform when

or when b >

v.

To prove (b), note that if the seller does not perform, his wealth
is, as before, k + b and the buyer's is - k -

r,

so the sum is b —

r.

However, if the seller does perform, whereas the seller's wealth is
still k, the buyer's is now max(b, v) - k -r, so the sum is max(b, v) —

r.

The difference between these sums is b max(b, v), wh.ich is nega-

tIve for v > b and is 0 otherwise. Hence, for the
sum to be maximized,
the only requirement is that the seller perform when v >
B.

b.

Q.E.D.

The case where prties are risk averse
Let us very briefly consider the possibility that parties might be

risk averse. The first observation that should be made is that prties'
attitudes toward risk do not alter the conclusions (in Propositions 1
and 2) whether it is Pareto efficient for the seller to perform. The

only effect of the parties' attitudes toward risk is to make it Pare to
efficient for rnney transfers to be made ex post. These transfers will
'be designed so as to accomplish a mutually beneficial sharing of risk.21

9

Thus, if the buyer is risk averse and the seller risk neutral, it
will be Pareto efficient for the seller to act as a perfect insurer of
the buyer; the transfers must therefore be such as to leave the buyer

with an unvarying level of wealth.22 In particu'ar, when under a Pareto

efficient contract the seller does not prform, he will py the yr
his expectancy.23
Conversely, if the buyer is risk neutral and the seller is risk

averse, it will be Pareto efficient for the yer

to

act as the perfect

insurer, and the transfers must therefore be such as to leave the seller

with an unvarying level of wealth. Hence, under a Pareto efficient
contract, the buyer will absorb the entire risk in production cost or
bids, as the case may be.24
If both the buyer and the seller are risk averse, then of course it
will not be Pareto efficient for either to act as a perfect insurer of
the other. The transfers made will, accomplish a sharing of risk in
accord with the parties' degrees of risk oversion, etc., and the situation will be an appropriate compromise between those described in the
last two paragraphs.

Contracts Are Incomplete

III.

As stated in the introduction, the view that will be taken here is
that it is in the mutual interests of parties to leave contracts incoin-

plete. This will be so because the possible adverse consequences of
failure to provide for certain contingencies may not be sufficient to
justify bearing the sure costs of including terms for those contingencies in the contract plus the expected costs of verifying their 'occurrence.

10

A.

The case

where p ties are risk

Let us make the following

neutral

assumptions. First, the parties must

choose a set S of contingencies for

which to write explicit Provisions:

Only i.f a contingency 0 is in S does the

contract specify whether or not

the seller shall perform; and let BS be the subset of contingencies
under which according to the contract the seller does not perform. If 0
is not in S, then something outside

the contract (e.g., contract. law,

Custom, renegotiation) determines what will happen should 0 occur. (It
will of course turn out that 0 will

be in S only If the provision for 0

would alter what would otherwise happen if 0 occurs.)
Second, there is a positive rate of cost for each party of l/2c(0)
of providing for 0; for each party l/2fu(0)dO is therefore the cost of
S
including contingent terms. Third, there is also a positive cost (8)
that the buyer would bear in order
is assumed that he will do

to verify the occurrence of 0, and it

so whenever the contract calls for the seller

not to perform. Thus, if h(0) is the

proLability density of 0, then

J(0)h(e)do is the expected verification cost

B

Under these assumptions, what will be a Pareto efficient selection
of contingencies for which to include terrns.and a determination concern-

ing the seller's performance? In other words, what will be a Pareto
efficient incomplete contract (S, B, k)? The next Proposition answers
this question, making use of the easily shown fact that an incocplete
Contract is Pareto efficient if and only if S and B are chosen so as to

maximize the sum

of

the buyer's and the seller's expected values. In

stating and proving the Proposition the following additional terms are

needed: x(0),the sum

of

the buyer's and seller's values given 0 if the

Contract provides for performance; y(0),the sum

of

values (exclusive of

11

verification costs) given ® if the contract allows non-performance;

z(O),the sum of values given 0 if the contract does not provide for .25

Proposition 3. Under a Pareto efficient incomplete contract, (a) suppose that there is a provision for a contingency 0. Then the provision
y(0) -

will call for performance when x(0)

Hence, (b) the set of contingencies for which there will be provisions in the contract is

(1) S = {Ola(0)

<h(0)[max(x(0),

y(O) -

(0))

z(0)]}.

Note. The formula (ii) implies that the following factors militate a-

gainst making a provision for a contingency: a high cost c(0)

of

making

a provision, a low probability density h(0) of occurrence, a high cost

(0) of verification (should the provision call for non-performance),
and a high sum of values z(0) in the absence of a provision.

Proof. The sum of expected values is

Thus, since a Pareto efficient contract

maximizes (2), part (a) is true. And from part (a) and (2), part (b)
similarly follows. Q.E.D.
B.

The case where parties are risk averse
If one or both parties are risk averse, although an analogue to the

Proposition can be proved according to which the same qualitative results

are valid (a high a(0) or a low h(0) or a high (O) militate against

12

including

U in S, etc.), there is no simple formula determining whether

a provision for a contingency will be made.27
IV.

Remedies for Breach of Contract and

Renegotiation as Substitutes

for Contingent Provisions

The last Proposition motivates interest in the question to be asked

here, namely, if there are no contingent terms whatever in a contract,
will the incentives to perform that are inherent in remedies for breach
and will the possibilities for renegotiation result in outcomes which
approximate the Pareto efficient outcomes of a

completely specified

contract? As indicated in the introduction, the answer to the question

will be a qualified, "Yes." This, and consideration of the costs and
difficulties in making contingent provisions just discussed will help to
explain the observed incompleteness of contracts, the use of remedies
for breach, and resort to renegotiation.

Since the assumption here is that a contract contains no provisions
for contingencies, it will merely be a statement of the form "the seller
promises to deliver a good" or to "perform a service" and an agreement

over price. As before, the price will be assumed to be paid at the
outset. The parties will be assumed to be aware that there is a remedy
available for breach of contract28 and that there may be an opportunity
for renegotiation if a problem arises.

As noted in the beginning, two types of rem..dy will be considered.

The first is fic performance, under which the seller must do what
he promised, and the second is payment of an amount of money as deter-

wined by a

measure. Three measures will be compared. Under the

first, the restitution measure, if the seller commits a breach he must
return the payment k that he had received from the buyer. Under the

13

reliance measure, the defaulting seller must return the payment and
compensate the buyer for reliance expenditures, so the buyer, gets r + k

in damages; thus the buyer is put in the position he was in before he

made a contract. Under the expectation

measure,

the defaulting seller

must pay the buyer what the court perceives to be the expectancy; thus,
were the expectancy accurately estimated, the buyer would be put in the

position he would have enjoyed had the seller performed.29 Interest in
the possibility of the court's misperceiving the expectancy is due to
the commonly held belief that because the determination of the value of
performance to the buyer requires the court to answer a hypothetical

question, it is easy for errors to be made. By contrast, the determination of the contract price or of reliance do not require the courts to
engage in such speculation; the price paid and money spent in reliance

should usually be fairly readily assessed. Now let

probability density of u and other random

variables--either b or c, as specified,

degenerate interval [u, u]. Moreover, it is assumed that v is contained
in (u, i) and this interval is itself contained in [cr, ].

assumed that u >

r

+

Last,

it is

k, in keeping with the idea that the court knows

that v must certainly be higher than r +

k--the

buyer would never be

willing to make a contract if what he had to spend, r +

k,

was greater

than or equal to the value of performance, V.30

In

what follows, the behavior of the parties under the various

remedies. will be determined and compared with that under Pareto effi-

cient complete contracts. Also the factors that would make a particular

14

remedy Pareto

or

to anther will be determined. The definition of

this term in the present context is
to a second if given

that one remedy is Pareto superior

any contract price and use of the second remedy,

both parties would prefer to make some adjustment in the price and to
employ instead the first remedy.
A.

where ties are

The

The

first

risk

neutral

situation to be analyzed is that where parties do not engage

in renegotiation of the contract because it is assumed to be too
costly
to do so.
(Thus the seller decides about
performance only on the basis
of whether this would make him better

breach.) Then the more complicated

off given the buyerts remedy for

situation with renegotiation will be

analyzed.

1. pfmance and breach

when there is no renegotiation. Consider

initially production contracts.

Under specific performance, the breach

set is by definition empty. Thus there is too little breach relative to
the Pareto efficient breach

set B cIc >v}; whenever production cost

exceeds the expectancy, there ought to be breach but ther is not. The

expected value to the buyer of the contract

under specific performance

is

(3) Eb(sp)_k=v_r_k
and to the seller it is

But

for otherwise the buyer would not have made the con-

tract.31 Thus B

res contains B*, and there is too much breach; whenever

15

production cost exceeds k and is less than v, there ought not to be

breach but there is. The expected values of the contract to the buyer
and the seller are, respectively,

Last, under the expectation measure, the breach set is Bexp =

{c,

since the seller will default and pay the court's estimate u of the

expectancy when the production cost is higher. Thus, if u were accurate
and equalled v, Bexp would equal B* and breach would occur when it ought

to. However, if u is an underestimate of v, then there might be breach
when there ought not; and if u is an overestimate, there might be per-

formance when there ought not. The expressions for the buyer's and
seller's expected values are34

Figure

2 summarizes the relationship between breach and performance

under the four remedies and under a Pareto efficient complete contingent

contract, and will help in comparing the remedies as to their mutual
desirability.

Proposition 4. In a production contract (a) the reliance measure is
always Pareto superior to the restitution

measure. However, the relation-

ship among the other remedies depends on the nature of the contractual
Situation: (b) The expectation measure is Pareto superior to the other
remedies if the estimate of the

expectancy is sufficiently precise (i.e,

if u and are sufficiently close to v).

(c) The reliance measure is

Pareto superior to the other remedies if the problem of excessive
performance under specific performance and under the expectation measure
(due to overestimation of the

expectancy) is more important than the

problem of inappropriate breach.35 (d) Specific performance is Pareto
superior to the other remedies if the problem of excessive breach under
the expectation measure (due to underestjn1atjon of the expectancy) and
under the reliance measure is more important than the problem of excessive
performance.

Note. Because the reliance measure induces even more excessive breach
than the restitution measure, part (a) is true.36

And because the

expectation measure induces Pareto efficient breach if the expectancy is

accurately estimated, part (b) is clear. The other two results are
self-explanatory.
Proof.

To demonstrate (a), we must show that for any price

of a

contract under the restitution measure, there exists a price k2 such

that both parties are better off under the reliance measure. To do this
we will show several facts that will enable us to employ a graphical

These facts justify

the relationship among the points above k1 in Figure 3 and also our

having drawn E(rel) and E(rel) + k as rising and meeting above the

Now if given

the reliance measure is employed rather

than restitution, the seller is made worse off; he moves from A to

E(rel) +

k1.

Suppose then that the price is raised to k2, which is the

point at which the seller becomes just as well off as he had been under

restitution. But at k2, the buyer is strictly better off than he had

The first term after the last equal sign is positive and represents the

waste of excessive performance under

specific performance, while the

second term is negative and corresponds to -the loss due to excessive

breach under reliance. Our assumption will be that the first term is
sufficiently large to exceed the second. Now consider a contract with
price

under which specific performance is the remedy for breach. To

prove that there is a price k2 such that both parties would be better

and since from (13) E(rel) rises with k, we know that

And observe that at k2 the seller is just as well off under the

reliance measure as he was under specific performance at k1, but the
-

buyer is strictly better off since D - A > B

A. Consequently, at a

price slightly above k2 both parties will be better off under the re-

liance measure. The argument for Pareto superiority of the reliance
measure over the expectation measure is analogous: We have (after some
manipulation) that

where the first term is positive, representing the relative gain when
there is appropriate breach under reliance but excessive performance
under the expectation measure, and where the second term is negative,

corresponding to the relative loss when there is inappropriate breach
under reliance and worthwhile performance under the expectation measure.
Employing, then, the assumption that the first term exceeds the second,
we can use a graph similar to that of Figure 3 to complete the argument.
To prove (d), because E(sp) does not depend on the contract price,

it will suffice to show that E(sp) exceeds E(rel) and E(exp). Observe

Consider now contracts for transfer of possession and assume ini-

tially that bids are made only to sellers. Then the situation is essentially the same as it was for production contracts: Figure 2 still
applies (but with the axis representing bids rather than production
cost); there is excessive performance under specific performance, ex-

cessive breach under the restitution measure, etc. For completeness,
however, we will write the various expected values. Under specific
performance, they are simply
(20) Eb(sp) -

k = v

(21) E5(sp) +

k = k.

and

Under the restitution measure, since the seller defaults and sells to
the bidder when the bid b exceeds k, the expected values are

When bids made to the seller are available to the buyer also, some
of the buyer's expected values are changed since if he had the good he
would sell to the bidder whenever b >

v.

(Of course, the seller's

behavior and expected values are as before.) To be precise, under sped'fic performance,

Under the restitution

measure, however, the buyer's expected value is

unchanged; since he will get delivery only when b

k and since k <

v

(otherwise it can be shown that he would not have been willing to make

the contract), the buyer will never wish to sell the good to the bidder.
Similarly, the buyer's expected value is unchanged under the reliance
measure.

With these formulas, the next result may be proved.

Propotion 5. In a contract for transfer of possession, (a) if it
is assumed that bids are made only to the seller, then the relationship
among remedies for breach is exactly as described (in Proposition 4) in

respect to production contracts. However, (b) if it is assumed that
bids are available to the buyer as well, then specific performance is
Pareto superior to the expectation measure, which is Pareto superior
to the reliance measure, which is Pareto superior to the restitution
measure.

22

Note. As remarked, part (a) is true for reasons analogous to those
explaining the previous Proposition; and since the proof is virtually
the same as that of the Proposition (with (20)-(27) playing the role of

(3)-(1O)), it is omitted. With regard to part (b), it is obvious that
when bids are available to the buyer, specific performance is Pareto

superior to the other remedies. On the one hand, Proposition 2 (b)
states that the seller's behavior is actually Pareto efficient under
specific performance because there is no problem of excessive performance; if the seller is delivered the good when the bid is higher

than the expectancy, he will sell it. On the other hand, under the
other remedies, there is a possibility that the seller will default when

the bid is less than the expectancy. And since the likelihood of this
is higher under the reliance measure than under the expectation measure,
and higher still under the restitution measure than under the reliance
measure, the relative ranking of the remedies is explained.

Proof. To prove (b), it suffices to show that E(sp)> E(exp) >E(rel),
for E(sp) and E(exp) do not depend on k. (We already know by appeal to
part (a) that the reliance measure is Pareto superior to the restitution
measure, since we observed that under these two measures neither the
buyer's nor the seller's behavior changes on account of the availability

of bids to the buyer.) Now, recalling that E(sp)E(sp)+E5(sp) and that
E(exp) and E(sp) are defined similarly, we have from (28), (21), (29),
and (27),

performance and breach when

there

is renegotiation. It will be

assumed here that the parties will engage in renegotiation if (given the
contingency) the resulting benefits would exceed the costs.

Specif-

ically, it will be assumed that if the buyer and the seller engage in

renegotiation, each will bear a positive cost t in the process; and they
will agree on whether the seller is to perform or to be released on the
basis of which would maximize the sum of values (i.e., they will agree

onthe Pareto efficient outcome). Further, if they engage in renegotiation, they will split equally the gain in the sum of values from having
done so; this will be done by means of a sidepayment.37 Last, they will
decide to engage in renegotiation if and only if the resulting increase
in the sum of. values exceeds the joint Costs of 2t (i.e., the decision

whether to renegotiate is Pareto efficient).

It will be seen that the pibility of renegotiation does not
alter the gualitative nature of the results of the last subsection;

Propositions 4 and S remain valid. This is because when there wasno
renegotiation, the mutual desirability of a remedy depended on how well
it functioned as a device to induce the seller to behave in a Pareto
efficient way; a remedy was undesirable to the extent that it resulted

24

in Pareto inefficient breach or Pareto inefficient performance. In the
present case, such departures from Pareto efficiency under a remedy are
still undesirable: if a departure would be large, then the parties will
engage in the costly process of renegotiation; and if the departure

would not be so large as to justify renegotiation, the departure will be
observed to occur.

In sum, then, the possibilites for renegotiation

mitigate but do not eliminate losses that would otherwise occur under
the remedies.

Consider for example the functioning of specific performance in

respect to production contracts. When there was no renegotiation, the
problem with this remedy was that if the production cost c exceeded the
expectancy v, enforced performance involved a loss to the parties of
c —

v.

In the present case, if c -

v

exceeds the costs of renegotiation

of 2t, the parties will find it worthwhile to bear the costs of that
process, and the result will be that the seller will pay the buyer for

release from his obligation to perform. Or, consider the remedy of
restitution. Before, the problem was one of excessive breach; if c
exceeded the price k but was less than v, there was a loss of v -

c.

In

the present case, if the loss v - c exceeds 2t, then the parties will
decide to renegotiate, and the buyer will pay the seller to perform.
Let us now describe precisely how the opportunity to renegotiate

affects the behavior of parties and the expected value formulas. This
will be done only for production contracts, as the situation for contracts for transfer of possession is similar and may easily be under-

stood by analogy to the previous subsection. Under specific performance, the situation is shown in Figure 5.

Using these formulas, we show in the Appendix that parts (a) and (b) of
Proposition 4 remain true, leaving the verification of parts (c) and (d)
to the interested reader; and as remarked, it is straightforward to

determine the expected value formulas for contracts for transfer of
possession and to check that Proposition 5 remains valid.
B.

The case where parties are risk averse45
In considering the role of remedies for breach as implicit sub-

stitutes for well specified contracts when one or both of the parties is
risk averse, the allocation of risk must be taken into account along

with incentives to perform. The general conclusions that emerge from
considering this dual role o'f remedies are simple to state. First,

suppose that the buyer is more risk averse than the seller. Then, other
things equal, the case for specific performance is strengthened over
that for the expectation measure, the case for it is in turn strengthened
over that for the reliance measure, and the case for it is stengthened

over that for the restitution measure. The reasons for these conclusions are of course that specific performance is by definition perfect
insurance for the buyer; the expectation measure provides only imperfect
insurance due to the courts' imperfect knowledge of the expectancy; and
the reliance and restitution measures leave respectively greater gaps in
coverage against loss of the expectancy (and create respectively greater
probabilities of such loss).

2t}

28

on the other hand, that

the buyer

is better able to bear

risk than the seller. Then our conclusions 4pend
in ue st ion. In pp4tion contrac

on the

ts spec i f i c perfo nn an c e

of contract

appears

to be

least desirable, and the expectation measure, the reliance measure, and
the restitution measures seem to be succei\Tey more desiab1e remedies

on grounds of risk-sharing. Specific performance makes the seller
absorb (or renegotiate to be released from) the potentially great risks

associated with variation of the production cost; the expectation measure
limits the risk to the (estimated)

expectancy; the reliance and restitu-

tion measures limit the risk to lower amounts. Thus what is a mutually

desirable remedy from the point of view of risk sharing may be an undesirable remedy from the point of view of the creation of incentives to

perform. In

to

contracts for transfer of possession, the situation

seems different; specific performance appears to be most desirable, and

the pectation measure, the reliance measure, and the restitution
measure seem to be successively less desirable remedies on grounds of

risk sharing. Under specific performance, there is, as is advantageous,
no variability in the seller's position--lie gets his payment and delivers

the good which he has in his possession to the buyer. Under the expectation measure, there is variability in the seller's final position, for
he might. default, pay damages, and sell to a high bidder. Under the

reliance and restitution measures, this variability is greater, since
the difference between a bid and damages paid grows larger.
V.

Comment
—

a.

Our general point that it is in the mutual interests of parties to

leave agreements incomplete and to rely instead on various substitutes

for contingent terms is confirmed by consideration of a broad range of

type of agreement. Certainly parties making informal

verbal

contracts

29

typically omit to mention possible contingencies unless these are very
likely or very important; and even parties carefully drawing up formal
contracts frequently do not provide explicitly for many contingencies.
It is generally appreciated from the outset that if an unexpected event
occurs leading a party to wish to default on his contractual obligation,

the difficulties that then arise will usually be settled in a reasonably
satisfactory way through use of recognized excuses, renegotiation, or
remedies for breach of contract.46
b.

Noreover, our particular results concerning the relative desira-

bility of remedies for breach of contract are consonant with two general

facts about their actual use.47 First, the expectancy is the favored
measure of damages, provided that it can be fairly accurately assessed.
(This is, of course, in accord with our result that the expectation

measure induces performance when it would be mutually desirable.) And
second, specific performance (rather than a damage measure) is employed
as the remedy for breach primarily for certain trpes of contracts for
transfer of possession, notably for contracts for the conveyance of

land. (This is in accord with our result on the mutual desirability of
specific performance as a remedy for breach of contracts for transfer of
possession when the buyer has access to bids made to the seller; and as
was explained, it also appears sensible on grounds of the allocation of
risk.)

1.

The first systematic formal analysis of damage measures .for breach
is presented in Shavell 1)980); but see extensions and additions

made in Rogerson [1980]. See also Kornhauser [1980]; and see Posner
[1977J for informal analysis of contracts and breach that will be of
interest to economists.
2.

The necessity of verification of a contingency was first emphasized
by Radner [1968].

3.
•

While this substitute for provisions is of undeniable significance,
it is subject to the important limitation that it can be successfully employed only in respect to those contingencies that are
easily observed and for which the agreement that the parties would
have made can be confidently imputed.

4.

The Contribution of this paper to the formal literature on contracts

would appear to lie in the analysis of contractual incompleteness;
the distinctions drawn between production contracts and contracts
for transfer of possession; the consideration of specific perfor-

mance; the treatment of imperfect knowledge of the courts; and.. the
allowance for costly renegotiation (but see Rogerson [1980] on
costless renegotiation).

5.

Any non-monetary variable affecting the well-being of a party is
thus assumed to have a monetary equivalent.

As the level of initial wealth will have no bearing on the
analysis, initial wealth will be suppressed in the notation; thus it
will appear as if initial wealth is zero.
6.

Thus issues concerning the effort devoted to search for contractual
partners are not studied here; for analysis of these issues, see
Diamond and Naskin [1979].

7.

This is determined endogenously in Shavell [1980], where it is a
focus of interest.

8.

This and other terminology to be introduced below conforms to stan-

dard usage; see for example Fuller and Perdue [1937] or Dawson and
Harvey [19771.
9.

The function f and other functions to be defined will also be assumed continuous.

10.

Note that the bids are taken as exogeiious to the model. This sunplifying assumption is appropriate if one is thinking of cases in
which bids are made without real negotiation with the contracting

party. Were the asumption relaxed, it can be shown that the qualitative nature of the results would not be altered.
11.

It will be seen that none of the results depend on this assumption,

and that only inessential modification of the proofs would be required to account for the possibility of a positive consumption
value (but one less than the expectancy (to be defined shortly)).
12.

This

will be seen to imply that the buyer will never himself wish to

commit a breach (whereas he might if his expectancy suddenly fell);

onlythe seller will be led to do so. Relaxing this assumption

3

would not change the qualitative nature of our results, as is evident
from Shavell [1980].
13.

If the good or service were traded on a well—organized market, the

only reason for parties to make a contract would be to share the
risk of fluctuations in the future market price; and because such
problems of pure risk-sharing are well understood, they are not

examined hee. However, Rogerson [1980], and Shavell [1981], an
earlier version of this paper, briefly discuss contracts in a market
setting -

14.

This assumption is inessential. Were payment to be made only if there
was performance, the contract price could be raised as if to compensate the seller for the chance he would not be paid, and so forth.
See Shave].1 [1980].

However, if one or both parties are risk averse, we would not

wish to make the assumption (and do not--see subsection B). This is
because subsequent monetary transfers would clearly matter; they
would allocate risk, about which risk averse parties care, by definition.

15. B may not be unique; but when this is so it will be noted and there
will be no cause for confusion.
16.

The proof of the following Remark is obvious and is therefore omitted
(but it is presented in Shavell [1981), and the proof of a similar
result is presented in Shavell [1980]).

17.

This statement is not quite precise, for it does not matter what the
seller does if the sum of values is not affected by whether the

seller performs. In that case, we will adopt the Convention that
the seller performs; and we will adopt similar conventions later on
in the paper without comment.

4

18.

This assumption seems appropriate if one is considering cases in

which bidders would find it costly to identify the contract buyer,
or when they would find it best to look elsewhere if the seller
reported that he was obligated to deliver to the contract buyer,
etc.
19.

Were we to complicate the model so as to allow for such purchases,
it will be clear that the next Proposition would still be true.

This is because there would be a loss in the sum values if the buyer
purchased from the bidder rather than receiving delivery directly
from the contract seller; for it is natural to assume that the buyer
would have to pay more than b--what the seller received--to induce

the bidder to sell. (Noreover, the purchase would involve additional
transaction costs.)
20.

It is also easy to show that the parties should be indifferent as
between making contracts with distinct Pareto efficient breach sets:

Suppose that B1 B are each Pareto efficient. Then for any contract (B1, k1) we must show that there exists a k2 such that under

(B2, k2), both parties are equally well off. To do this, let k2 =

Eb(B2)

-

Eb(Bl)

= (E(B2)
= E(B1)
21.

+
+

+

k1.

Eb(B2))

Hence, Eb(B2) - k2
-

Eb(Bl)

+

k1

=

Eb(Bl) -

(E(B1)

+

k

Eb(Bl))

and E5(B2) +
-

Eb(Bl)

+

k1.

Specifically, if we let S denote a contingency, then a complete contingent contract is specified not only by k and B, but also by a

function, say g(O), indicating how much (positive or negative) the

seller is to pay the buyer given the contingency 0. It is easy to
show that a necessary condition for Pareto efficiency of a contract
(B, K, g(•)) is that B be such that for each 0, the sum

of

values is

5

maximized. Thus, by the Remark, the choiceof B is the same as when
parties are risk neutral. And given this choice of B, g must be
such as to share risk in a Pareto efficient way, that is, (as Borch
[1962] originally showed) the ratio of the buyer's marginal utility
to the seller's must be maintained constant over 0.
22.

This is of course a well known aspect of Pareto efficient risk
sharing.

23.

If this is true, the buyer will get his expectancy whether or not

the

seller performs, so that the buyer's final wealth will be

constant (and will equal v - k 24.

r).

For example, under a contract for transfer of possession, if it is
Pareto efficient for the seller to sell to a bidder, the buyer will
get the proceeds from the sale.

(Of course, because the seller

expects to give up these proceeds in such circumstances, he will
have received a higher contract price than otherwise.)
25.

Thus z(O) might equal either x(O) or y(O), depending on what the
seller would do in the absence of a contingent term in the contract.

Also, z(O) might be less than either or both of x(O) and y(6) if
given 0 there would be costs involved in settling disputes.
B =

27.

There is no simple formula because the decision whether to include a

0B}.

particular contingency depends (as it did not in the risk neutral

case) on whether there are provisions for other contingencies. Such
interdependence may come about through the following kind of "wealth

effect": If provisions are made for other contingencies, a

6

party's wealth will be lowered due to the costs f(0)dO. This could
S

in

turn increase his need for "insurance" against an adverse 0 and

thus his desire to include a provision allowing for an appropriate
sharing
28.

of risk given 0.

With one exception, it will make no difference whether one thinks of
the parties as being aware of the remedy the courts will apply (the
interpretation made in the paper) or as having specified in the
contract which remedy (so called liquidated damages) will apply.
The exception concerns the expectation measure; see note 29.

29.

If the reader wishes to consider the situation where the parties set
out in the contract the amount to be paid for breach, then it might

be appropriate to assume that u

v sine the seller would often

have a better idea of the expectancy than the court (and, in any
event, we have assumed here that the seller knows v).
30.

It can easily be shown that v >

r

+ k must hold for the buyer to be

willing to make a contract (i.e., for Eb - k > 0) under any of the

remedies considered. See for example note 31 below.
31.

Thus, using the next equation, we have vPr{c)c

k > 0 or vPr{cjc

ci, the seller will commit breach with probability one under

restitution, so that the expected value of the contract to the

seller would be zero (and to the buyer it woul.d be negative). It
will also follow by similar reasoning that k must exceed c under the
other remedies as well, and we will not bother to mention this fact
again.

>

7

33.

This follows from the condition Eb(rel) - k > 0 by an argument
analogous to that in note 31.

34.

In the double integral in (9), it will be convenient to indicate the

set over which integration is performed by the shorthand {c > uJ

rather than by {c, uc > u} or by upper and lower limits of integration. We will also employ similar shorthands in other integral
expressions.
35.

The precise meaning of "the problem of excessive performance" and
"the problem of inappropriate breach" is best explained in the
proof.

36.

As the reader who examines the proof will see, there is a complication in the argument showing part (a) (and (c)) due to. the fact that

under the reliance measure, the contract price affects breach be-

havior and thus the sum of expected values of the contract. (The
higher the price, the less frequent is breach and the higher the sum

of values.) This means that to show that the reliance measure is
Pareto superior to another measure, one must use the definition of
Pareto superiority directly; it does not suffice to demonstrate that
the sum of expected values is higher under the reliance measure.
37.

The assumptions that they split the gain equally and that they bear
equal costs of renegotiation are not important to our results.

38.

If we let z be the payment made by the seller for his release, then
the improvement in the buyer's position will be (z -

(v

-

r

-

k)

= z -

t

-

v.

t-

r

-

-

But we assumed that the parties split

equally the gain in the sum of values from renegotiation, and these
gains are (c (c -

v)

-

t,

v)

or z

-

2t.

=v

+

Hence z must satisfy z -

l/2(c

-

v).

t

-

v

=

1/2

(Note therefore that the higher

8

the seller's cost of production would be, the more he pays the buyer
for release.)
39.

In (32), the first term on the right hand side is the expected

benefit from performance, the third is expected payments made by the
seller when renegotiation occurs, and the fourth is the expected

cost of renegotiation. The other formu'as below are similarly
explained.
40.

Let z be the buyer's payment. Then the improvement in the seller's

position if he does not default is (

If z is again the buyer's payment, thenthe improvement in the

The terms on the right hand side of (38) are the expected value of
performance, reliance, expected payments made to the seller to
induce him to perform (when the expectancy is significantly underestimated), the expected cost of such renegotiations, expected

payments received from the seller for his release (when the expectancy is significantly overestimated), etc.

remarks in Shavell [1980].

See the well known article by tlacaulay [1963] for an interesting
discussion that emphasizes. the incompleteness of contracts and

settlement of disputes through renegotiation and other informal or
extralegal means.

Shavell [in process] relates the theoretical results of this paper
to contractual practice and to legal commentators' views about
contract law.
