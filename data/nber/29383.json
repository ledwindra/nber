    "abstract": "\n\nIn a rare example of an explicit national goal for income distribution besides reducing poverty, China\u2019s leadership has recently committed to expanding the middle-income share\u2014moving to a less polarized \u201colive-shaped\u201d distribution. Recognizing the potential trade-offs, the paper asks whether China\u2019s experience indicates that income-polarization was a by-product of past economic progress, including poverty reduction. The paper does not find robust time-series evidence of polarizing effects alongside either economic growth or population urbanization (including among those below the national median). There was strong co-movement between polarization and inequality. Larger urban-rural gaps in mean incomes are strongly polarizing in China.\n\n",
