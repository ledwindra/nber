ABSTRACT
This paper explores the power of personality traits both as predictors and as causes of academic and
economic success, health, and criminal activity. Measured personality is interpreted as a construct
derived from an economic model of preferences, constraints, and information. Evidence is reviewed
about the “situational specificity” of personality traits and preferences. An extreme version of the situationist
view claims that there are no stable personality traits or preference parameters that persons carry across
different situations. Those who hold this view claim that personality psychology has little relevance
for economics. The biological and evolutionary origins of personality traits are explored. Personality
measurement systems and relationships among the measures used by psychologists are examined.
The predictive power of personality measures is compared with the predictive power of measures of
cognition captured by IQ and achievement tests. For many outcomes, personality measures are just
as predictive as cognitive measures, even after controlling for family background and cognition. Moreover,
standard measures of cognition are heavily influenced by personality traits and incentives. Measured
personality traits are positively correlated over the life cycle. However, they are not fixed and can
be altered by experience and investment. Intervention studies, along with studies in biology and neuroscience,
establish a causal basis for the observed effect of personality traits on economic and social outcomes.
Personality traits are more malleable over the life cycle compared to cognition, which becomes highly
rank stable around age 10. Interventions that change personality are promising avenues for addressing
poverty and disadvantage.

Introduction

The power of cognitive ability in predicting social and economic success is well documented.2
Economists, psychologists, and sociologists now actively examine determinants of social and
economic success beyond those captured by cognitive ability.3 However, there remains a
substantial imbalance in the scholarly and policy literatures in the emphasis placed on cognitive
ability compared to other traits. This chapter aims to correct this imbalance. It considers how
personality psychology informs economics and how economics can inform personality
psychology.
A recent analysis of the Perry Preschool Program shows that traits other than those
measured by IQ and achievement tests causally determine life outcomes.4 This experimental
intervention enriched the early social and emotional environments of disadvantaged children
ages 3 and 4 with subnormal IQs. It primarily focused on fostering the ability of participants to
plan tasks, to execute their plans, and to review their work in social groups.5 In addition, it
taught reading and math skills, although this was not its main focus. Both treatment and control
group members were followed into their 40s.6

See, e.g., the studies cited in Becker [1964] and the discussion of ability bias in Griliches [1977].
See Bowles, Gintis and Osborne [2001a] and Borghans, Duckworth, Heckman et al. [2008] for reviews of the
literature in economics. Marxist economists and sociologists (e.g., Bowles and Gintis [1976] and Mueser [1979],
respectively) pioneered the analysis of the impact of personality on earnings. Mueller and Plug [2006] estimate
empirical relationships between personality traits and earnings, schooling and occupational attainment. Hartog
[1980; 2001] relates the Big Five personality factors to earnings. van Praag [1985] draws on the psychology
literature to analyze economic preferences. van Praag and van Weeren [1988] and Borghans, Duckworth, Heckman
et al. [2008] link economics with psychology.

We draw on the research of Heckman, Malofeeva, Pinto et al. [2010]. See Weikart, Epstein, Schweinhart et al.
[1978], Sylva [1997], Schweinhart, Montie, Xiang et al. [2005] and Heckman, Moon, Pinto et al. [2010a] for
descriptions of the Perry program.

Sylva [1997] shows that the Perry Program has important features that are shared with programs designed to foster
self-control in children, for example, Tools of the Mind (Bodrova and Leong [2001]).

Plans are underway to follow the Perry sample through age 50.

Figure 1 shows that, by age ten, treatment group mean IQs were the same as control
group mean IQs. Many critics of early childhood programs seize on this and related evidence to
dismiss the value of early intervention studies.7 Yet on a variety of measures of socioeconomic
achievement, the treatment group was far more successful than the control group.8 The annual
rate of return to the Perry Program was in the range 6-10% for boys and girls separately.9 These
rates of return are statistically significant and above the returns to the US stock market over the
post-war period.10 The intervention changed something other than IQ, and that something
produced strong treatment effects. Heckman, Malofeeva, Pinto et al. [2010] show that the
personality traits of the participants were beneficially improved in a lasting way.11 This chapter
is about those traits.

We discuss this evidence in Section 8. The traits changed were related to self-control and social behavior.
Participants of both genders had better “externalizing behavior” while girls also had improved “internalizing
behavior.” See Heckman, Malofeeva, Pinto et al. [2010]. Duncan and Magnuson [2010b] offer a different
interpretation of the traits changed by the Perry experiment, but both analyses agree that it was not a boost in IQ that
improved the life outcomes of Perry treatment group members.

Personality psychologists mainly focus on empirical associations between their measures
of personality traits and a variety of life outcomes. Yet for policy purposes, it is important to
know mechanisms of causation to explore the viability of alternative policies.12 We use
economic theory to formalize the insights of personality psychology and to craft models that are
useful for exploring the causal mechanisms that are needed for policy analysis.
We interpret personality as a strategy function for responding to life situations.
Personality traits, along with other influences, produce measured personality as the output of
personality strategy functions. We discuss how psychologists use measurements of the
performance of persons on tasks or in taking actions to identify personality traits and cognitive

traits. We discuss fundamental identification problems that arise in applying their procedures to
infer traits.
Many economists, especially behavioral economists, are not convinced about the
predictive validity, stability, or causal status of economic preference parameters or personality
traits. They believe, instead, that the constraints and incentives in situations almost entirely
determine behavior.13 This once popular, extreme situationist view is no longer generally
accepted in psychology. Most psychologists now accept the notion of a stable personality as
defined in this chapter.14 Measured personality exhibits both stability and variation across
situations.15
Although personality traits are not merely situation-driven ephemera, they are also not set
in stone. We present evidence that both cognitive and personality traits evolve over the life
cycle—but at different rates at different stages. Recently developed economic models of
parental and environmental investment in children help to explain the evolution of these traits.
This chapter addresses the following specific questions, which we pose here and answer
in the concluding section:
(1) How can we fit psychological constructs of personality into an economic framework? Can
conventional models of preferences in economics characterize the main theories in personality
psychology?
(2) What are the main measurement systems used in psychology for representing personality and
personality traits, and how are they validated? How are different systems related to each other?

13

See, e.g., Mischel and Shoda [1995; 2008].

What is the relationship between standard measures of personality and measures of
psychopathology and child temperament?
(3) What is the relationship between economic preference parameters and psychological
measurements?
(4) How stable across situations and over the life cycle are preference parameters and
personality traits?
(5) What is the evidence on the predictive power of cognitive and personality traits?
(6) What is the evidence on the causal power of personality on behavioral outcomes?
(7) Can personality be altered across the life cycle? Are interventions that change personality
traits likely fruitful avenues for policy?
(8) Do the findings from psychology suggest that conventional economic theory should be
enriched?
The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents a definition of personality that
captures central ideas in the literature on personality psychology. It also presents a brief history
of personality psychology and the person-situation debate that paralyzed the field for 20 years
and that still influences behavioral economics. Section 3 defines measured personality as a
response function using an economic model of preferences, expectations, and constraints. Our
model distinguishes measured personality from personality traits. We interpret personality as a
response function mapping variables that characterize traits and situations to manifest
(measured) personality. Our definition formalizes various definitions of personality used in the
literature on personality psychology and facilitates the analysis of personality using the tools of
economics. We also sketch a dynamic model of trait formation.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
11
Section 4 discusses alternative criteria that psychologists use to define traits. It examines
the strengths and limitations of each approach. We link our abstract definition to linear factor
models that are commonly used to identify personality and cognitive traits.
Section 5 presents the main systems used to measure personality and cognition and
discusses the relationship among the systems. We illustrate a nonidentification result developed
in Section 3 by showing how scores on IQ tests are greatly affected by incentives and context.
We present additional evidence showing that the scores on achievement tests depend on
cognitive and personality measurements, with a substantial predictive role for personality
measures. Measures of “IQ” commonly used in economics and social science conflate measures
of cognition and personality.
Section 6 discusses economic preferences and examines the evidence relating economic
preference parameters to psychological parameters. Section 7 surveys the evidence on the
predictive validity of personality measures for education, crime, health, and labor market
outcomes. The material presented in the main text summarizes a large and growing empirical
literature. A Web Appendix presents additional detail on the literature relating cognition and
personality in each of these areas of economic and social life.16
Section 8 presents evidence on the causal impact of personality on outcomes, as well as
evidence on the stability and malleability of personality traits and preferences. We extend the
theoretical framework for trait formation introduced in Section 3 and discuss a corresponding
measurement system. We discuss the evidence from intervention studies. Section 9 concludes
with provisional answers to the eight questions.

Personality and Personality Traits: Definitions and a Brief History of
Personality Psychology

Personality psychology attempts to describe the whole person.17 It considers both universal traits
and individual differences. It examines the ways in which people are unique. As a sign of its
breadth, personality psychology considers cognitive functioning as one aspect of personality.
In considering the content of personality psychology, it is helpful to distinguish
personality traits, personality as a response function, and measured personality. Personality
is a response function that maps personality traits to measured (manifest) personality.
One leading personality psychologist defines personality traits in the following way:
“Personality traits are the relatively enduring patterns of thoughts, feelings, and
behaviors that reflect the tendency to respond in certain ways under certain
circumstances.” (Roberts [2009, p. 140])
This definition, or closely related versions, are used throughout personality psychology.18 We
formalize these notions in Section 3.
Roberts’ definition of personality traits refers to the stability of certain patterns of
behavior—actions or responses to situations that people take, including patterns of thoughts or
feelings. Perceptions, expectations of future events and preferences may shape behavior,
feelings and thoughts. In this way, cognitive activities help to determine measured personality.
17

Cervone and Pervin [2009] provide a clear introduction to personality psychology.
However, some personality psychologists use this or a very similar definition to define personality and not
personality traits. Thus Cervone and Pervin [2009] define personality as
“psychological qualities that contribute to an individual’s enduring and distinctive patterns of
thinking, feeling and behaving” (p. 8).
Another definition in a graduate text on personality by McAdams emphasizes context more strongly:
“Personality is a patterning of dispositional traits, characteristic adaptations, and integrative life
stories set in culture and shaped by human nature” McAdams [2006].
In this chapter, we define personality as a property of a system of equations and measured personality is the
output of those equations.

18

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
13
There are many different models of personality.19 A prototypical model that captures
many features of a wide class of models in personality psychology is one due to Roberts [2006].
He presents the schematic displayed in Figure 2 to relate personality traits to behavior.20 He
distinguishes mental abilities from personality traits (the items in the boxes will be discussed in
later sections of this chapter). These, along with preferences (motives, interests, and values) and
narratives (the stories people tell themselves in organizing their lives and making meanings of
them), shape one’s identity and reputation, including the views of the person by others and the
person’s perception of how others perceive him. Identity and reputation in turn shape the roles
of individuals in the economy and the society and the larger culture to which they belong.
Personality is the system of relationships that map traits and other determinants of behavior into
measured actions.
In Roberts' vision of personality, feedback processes operate among all components of
Figure 2. Thus his broad conception of personality includes the possibility that identity shapes
traits and abilities, perhaps through a mechanism such as epigenetics, in which environment
affects gene expression.21 Measured personality results from interactions among components of
the system. Personality traits are one determinant of personality and need to be carefully
distinguished from the full expression of personality, which is generated by the traits interacting
with other factors. Personality is seen as a system of behaviors, thoughts, and feelings that
emerge from the interacting components.

See the models in John, Robins and Pervin [2008].
Graphical models like Figure 2 are the rule in personality psychology. Explicit formal models are rare. Section 3
presents a formal model.

Figure 2. Roberts’s Model of Personality as the Output of a System

Source: Roberts [2006].

In Section 3, we formalize aspects of Roberts’ framework for personality within an
economic model of production, choice, and information. Figure 2 presages our discussion of a
basic identification problem discussed in Section 3. Measurements and behaviors that arise from
responses to incentives and interactions with culture are used to infer personality traits and
abilities. Personality traits and cognitive abilities, along with the other “units of analysis” in
Figure 2, produce the observed behaviors that are used to infer the generating traits. To infer
traits from behaviors requires “parsing out” or standardizing for all of the other contributing
factors that produce the observed behavior—a challenging task. The inability to parse and
localize behaviors that depend on a single trait or ability gives rise to a fundamental

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
15
identification problem. Behavior depends on incentives created by situations. Accurately
measuring personality traits requires standardizing for situation.
2.A.

A Brief History of Personality Psychology22

Interest in how individual behavior differs in common situations is as old as human history. The
importance of personality traits for determining educational outcomes was recognized by the
creators of the first IQ tests. Alfred Binet, architect of the first modern intelligence test that
became the Stanford-Binet IQ test, noted that performance in school
“...admits of other things than intelligence; to succeed in his studies, one must have
qualities which depend on attention, will, and character; for example a certain docility, a
regularity of habits, and especially continuity of effort. A child, even if intelligent, will
learn little in class if he never listens, if he spends his time in playing tricks, in giggling,
is playing truant.” (Binet [1916, p. 254])
At about the same time that Binet was writing, Charles Spearman, best known for his
work on “ g ”—a unitary factor that is claimed to capture the structure of intelligence—along
with his student, Edward Webb, undertook studies of “character” because of “the urgency of its
practical application to all the business of life” (Webb [1915, p. 1]). Spearman and Webb
concluded that many positive aspects of character shared a relation to what modern personality
psychologists term “Conscientiousness.”23 This general factor, which Spearman and Webb
chose to call “persistence of motives,” meaning “consistency of action resulting from deliberate
volition, or will,” was distinct from a general intelligence factor (Webb [1915, p. 60]).24

22

See Revelle, Wilt and Condon [2010] for an informative history of personality psychology.
Here and elsewhere through this essay, we capitalize personality traits.
24
Many other psychologists who developed and promoted IQ tests expressed similar sentiments. See the Web
Appendix Section 2.A.
23

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
16
Arthur Jensen, an intellectual heir of Spearman who is widely regarded as a proponent of

g as an explanatory factor of success and failure in many domains of life, writes:
“What are the chief personality traits which, interacting with g , relate to individual
differences in achievement and vocational success? The most universal personality trait
is conscientiousness, that is, being responsible, dependable, caring, organized and
persistent” Jensen [1998, p. 575].

The Pioneers of Personality Psychology
Over the past century, interest in personality among psychologists has fluctuated dramatically.
During the first half of the twentieth century, many of the most prominent psychologists (e.g.,
Gordon Allport, Raymond Cattell, Hans Eysenck, Charles Spearman, Lewis Terman) were
vigorously engaged in the study of individual differences in behaviors and traits. Psychologists
studied personality traits along with intelligence, interests, and motivation and measured
differences and similarities within and across individuals.
A systematic approach to the study of personality was conceived by early psychologists
who believed that the most important dimensions on which human beings differed would be
captured in natural language. These personality pioneers extracted words from the (English)
dictionary that characterized individual differences between people (e.g., irritable, proud), after
eliminating synonyms and words not associated with traits. They designed and administered
studies of trait inventories to large samples of individuals and applied the same factor analytic
methods developed by Galton, Spearman, Binet, Pearson, Cattell, and Thorndike to these
assessments in order to isolate “ g ” to identify the structure of cognitive abilities.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
17
The fruits of several decades of research in this tradition beginning in the 1970s have
produced a widely (but not universally) shared consensus taxonomy of traits, known as the Big
Five, that is arrived at through factor analysis of observer and self-reports of behaviors.25 The
Big Five posits a hierarchical organization for personality traits, with five factors at the highest
level and progressively more narrowly defined traits (or facets) at lower and lower levels.

Table 1. The Big Five Traits
Trait
I. Openness to Experience (Intellect)

Definition of Trait*
The tendency to be open to new
aesthetic, cultural, or intellectual
experiences.

II. Conscientiousness

The tendency to be organized,
responsible, and hardworking.

III. Extraversion

An orientation of one’s interests and
energies toward the outer world of
people and things rather than the inner
world of subjective experience;
characterized by positive affect and
sociability.

IV. Agreeableness

The tendency to act in a cooperative,
unselfish manner.

V. Neuroticism (Emotional Stability)

Neuroticism is a chronic level of
emotional instability and proneness to
psychological distress.
Emotional stability is predictability and
consistency in emotional reactions,
with absence of rapid mood changes.

* From the American Psychological Association Dictionary [2007].

Table 1 presents the Big Five traits. They are Openness to Experience (also called
Intellect or Culture), Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (also

25

Goldberg [1993], Barenbaum and Winter [2008], John and Srivastava [1999], Krueger and Johnson [2008]
discuss the Big Five.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
18
called Emotional Stability).26 The Big Five factors represent personality traits at the broadest
level of abstraction. They summarize a large number of distinct, more specific, personality
facets.
The Big Five are defined without reference to any context (i.e., situation). This practice
gives rise to an identification problem that we discuss in Section 3. The behaviors used to
measure the traits are also determined by factors other than the Big Five traits. John [1990],
Goldberg [1993], and Costa and McCrae [1992a] present evidence that most of the variables
used to assess personality traits in academic research in the field of personality psychology can
be mapped into one or more of the dimensions of the Big Five. They argue that the Big Five are
the longitude and latitude of personality traits, by which all more narrowly defined traits may be
categorized (see also Costa and McCrae [1992a]). We discuss the Big Five further in Section 5,
where we also consider alternative measurement systems.

The Person-Situation Debate, Its Lingering Influence in Economics, and the Subsequent
Flourishing of Personality Psychology
In 1968, Walter Mischel published a monograph entitled Personality and Assessment,
challenging the most important theoretical assumptions and empirical findings of personality
psychology. An acrimonious “person-situation” debate ensued, which pitted those who favored
situational factors as explaining behavior against those who considered personality traits as more
consequential. During this time, considered by many to be a dark age in the history of personality
psychology, the general Zeitgeist favored experimental social psychological approaches which

26

The acronym OCEAN is sometimes used to summarize these traits.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
19
focused on the importance of the situation compared to the individual traits featured in
personality psychology.
Mischel noted that correlations between behavioral task measures of personality and
questionnaire measures seldom, if ever, exceeded 0.3.27,28 The implication of such withinindividual behavioral heterogeneity suggested to Mischel that “the behaviors which are often
construed as stable personality trait indicators are highly specific and depend on the details of the
evoking situations and the response mode employed to measure them” (p. 37). Mischel wrote
“…with the possible exception of intelligence, highly generalized behavioral
consistencies have not been demonstrated, and the concept of personality traits as broad
dispositions is thus untenable” – Mischel [1968, p. 146]
Mischel went on to write that global (i.e., domain-general) traits (e.g., “impulsive”, “confident”)
measured in one situation did not predict future behavior and outcomes in other situations. His
view was that global traits, in attempting to summarize behavioral dispositions without regard to
situational contingencies, were “excessively crude, gross units to encompass adequately the
extraordinary complexity and subtlety of the discriminations that people constantly make” (p.
301).
Mischel now suggests [2004] that behaviors can be consistent across time, but that the
locus of consistency is to be found in highly contextualized if-situation/then-behavior
contingencies (e.g., “If I feel threatened, then I am aggressive”). Variance across situations was,

27

There is great irony in the fact that none of the correlations of cognitive measures with outcomes that are reported
in Table A1 in the Web Appendix are as high as 0.3, but no one questions the power of cognition in predicting
outcomes in social life. Few studies in social psychology show correlations as high as 0.2 (see Richard, Bond and
Stokes-Zoota [2003]).
28
Psychologists often work with standardized variables (variables normalized by standard deviations). They report
correlations between standardized variables as “effect sizes.”

20
in Mischel’s view, improperly treated by most personality psychologists as “error.”29 Indeed, in
his view, the systematic variation of behavior across situations points to underlying motivations,
beliefs, schemas, strategies, and other factors that collectively and interactively give rise to
coherence in any individual’s measured personality. His revised view of personality is broadly
consistent with Robert’s Figure 2.
In Section 3, we formalize the “if-then” relationship using an economic model. We show
that the person-situation debate boils down to an empirical question about the relative
importance of person, situation, and their interaction in explaining behaviors. Although Mischel
may have intended otherwise, proponents of the situationist view have used his monograph as
ammunition in the battle against accepting evidence from personality psychology into
economics. Like most heated debates in social science, this one occurred in the absence of much
data. In Section 5, we discuss the body of evidence that has emerged over the past four decades
on the existence of stable personality traits.
The debate over the relative importance of person and situation in the 1960s and 1970s
reflected deeper currents in psychology and social science more generally, that still run strong.
Behaviorism, associated with B. F. Skinner was influential. It posited that experience explains
all aspects of behavior. There was the widely held notion that situation and experience were all
powerful—that people were born as blank slates.30 This captured the interventionist spirit of the
times. Inter-individual heterogeneity in traits was ignored. Ross and Nisbett [1991] summarize
the position of many social psychologists:

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
21
“Manipulations of the immediate social situation can overwhelm in importance the type
of individual differences in personal traits or dispositions that people normally think of
as being determinative of social behavior” (p. xiv).
Many behavioral economists hold a similar view and they often appeal to Mischel as a guiding
influence. For example, in a recent round table discussion, Richard Thaler noted that
“The great contribution to psychology by Walter Mischel [...] is to show that there is no
such thing as a stable personality trait” (Thaler [2008]).
Many studies in behavioral economics attempt to establish inconsistency in behavior across
situations, in violation of standard assumptions of stable preferences used in mainstream
economics. For instance, several studies find very low correlations in risk-taking behavior across
situations.31
Personality psychology survived the Behaviorist assault and is a prospering field. A rich
body of correlational evidence, which we summarize in Section 7, shows that for many
outcomes, measured personality traits are as predictive, and are sometimes more predictive than
standard measures of cognition, that traits are stable across situations, and situations also matter.
Mounting evidence that behavior has a biological basis suggests that personality is an
important determinant of behavior. The evidence from behavioral genetics shows that measured
personality traits are as heritable as cognitive traits. Studies in neuroscience show that
alterations in brain structure and function through accidents, disease and by experiments affect
measured personality. They reinforce the evidence from heritability studies. This evidence and
other evidence shows that something about measured personality is real. We review this
evidence in Section 8.

Conceptualizing Personality and Personality Traits Within Economic
Models

Personality psychologists rarely use formal models to define or measure their constructs. In
order to introduce their knowledge to economists, we formalize their frameworks. Doing so
makes the concepts of personality psychology more precise and provides a basis for
measurement and policy analysis.
We introduce a series of progressively more comprehensive models to integrate concepts
from personality psychology into economics.32 Roberts’ framework (Figure 2) captures the main
features of the influential models used in personality psychology. We use it as a point of
departure. Psychology adds new and often more nuanced descriptions of human behavior to the
standard descriptions used in economics.
In the nineteenth century, economics and psychology were closely aligned. Economists
then spoke of the “hedonic calculus” used by people weighing choices.33 One of the advances
made in neoclassical economics in the first half of the twentieth century was to focus on choices
and the objective (easily measured) factors (like prices and incomes) that determine choices.
Revealed preference became a central tool of economics and was implemented using the
marginal rate of substitution between choices—a key parameter that emerged from the
neoclassical revolution.34 This parameter did not require measurable utility or knowledge of the

Borghans, Duckworth, Heckman et al. [2008] develop a variety of economic models for integrating personality
psychology into economic models. We build on their analysis. We review these frameworks in Section A3 of the
Web Appendix.

mental states of the agents making choices. Mental states and measureable utility, once the
province of economists, were eliminated by Occam’s Razor.
Measurable utility was used in utilitarian economics but fell out of favor (see Samuelson
[1956], Foster and Sen [1997]). Preferences that fulfilled criteria for rationality were consistent
with utility functions that were determined up to monotonic transformations. Measurable utility
returned in a specific fashion with analyses of decision-making under uncertainty (see Savage
[1954]).
Most economists view mental states as unnecessary baggage except insofar as they affect
choices. Thus, the traits, abilities, and narratives used by Roberts in Figure 2 are of interest to
most economists only if they affect choices through preferences, constraints, and effects on
information processing capabilities. Motives and values are captured in part by economic
preference parameters. Until recently, “happiness,” and “aggregate utility,” as well as other
subjective mental states that do not affect behavior (choices) were considered uninteresting to
most economists.35
Preferences, constraints, and expectations provide the most direct way to introduce
psychological variables into economic models. We begin our analysis with a barebones
approach that focuses on constraints. For example, cognitive and personality traits affect
earnings capacity because they enhance productivity (see, e.g., Bowles, Gintis and Osborne
[2001a]), and, at least up to a point, more of a trait can generate more resources which enlarge
choice sets and hence directly affect behavior.

35

See, however, the revival of utility measurement in the happiness literature (see Layard [2005]). Perceptions on
which one does not act, included in the domain of psychology, have recently entered economic studies through the
happiness literature.

3.A.

An Approach Based on Comparative Advantage

The Roy model [1951] of comparative advantage provides a useful starting point. Heckman,
Stixrud and Urzua [2006] use the Roy model to introduce psychological variables into the study
of social and economic outcomes.36 Personality traits are treated as endowments, and choices are
determined by personality traits and other factors as they affect productivity in skills.
Agents can perform one of J tasks with productivity Pj , j  1, , J  . The productivity
in task j depends on the traits of agents represented by  , and the “effort” they expend on the
task, ej :
(1)

Pj   j ( , e j ),

j  = 1, , J  , e j   ,   .

The traits are the endowments of agents that govern behavior. Examples of traits include height,
personality characteristics, problem solving ability, and strength.  is a public good as it is
available in the same amount for all tasks. Productivity also depends on effort e j . Effort is
assumed to be divisible and fixed in supply.
In much applied research, effort and traits are often assumed to be measured so that over
the relevant range, assuming differentiability with respects to e j and  ,

 j

but neither condition is strictly required. Excess effort (over-exertion; too much attention to
detail) may be counterproductive so that function j need not be monotonic in e j , contrary to
what is assumed here. Indeed, as discussed in Section 5, certain psychopathologies are
associated with extreme levels of traits that are quite productive at normal levels. Different traits

variety of intermediate cases might exist where some effort-trait relationships are complementary
and others are substitution relationships. Some people may solve complex math problems with
no effort, while others may have to allocate considerable time and effort to achieve the same
result. Effort can be a vector (time, mental energy, attention), and it is assumed to be a divisible
private good with the feature that the more that is applied to task j, the less is available for all
other tasks at any point in time.

Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven et al. [1998] interpret self-control as a component of e that is
fixed over given time periods. A person who exerts more self-control in one task may be less
self-controlled in another task.
Let R j be the reward per unit productivity in task j . In the first case we analyze, agents
can productively engage in only one of the J tasks at any time. This restriction can be
interpreted as a case where effort can only be applied to a single task. A reward maximizing
agent with trait  and endowment e faces the problem of picking the maximal task to perform,
ĵ where

Cattan [2010] shows that sociability has negative returns in some sectors but positive returns in other sectors.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
26
In this case,  and e play the same role. People with different effort and capability
endowments will generally choose different tasks.38,39 Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006] show
how persons with different endowments of personality and intelligence sort into different
occupations and levels of schooling. People low in certain traits may have better endowments of
effort and may compensate for their shortfall in ability by exerting effort. For certain tasks (e.g.,
creating new branches of mathematics), there may be threshold levels of  such that for    j ,

 j  , e j   0 for all e j  e . (The person needs a given level of trait  no matter how hard they
try.) The higher R j , the more likely will the person choose to perform task j . The particular
choice of which j to perform depends on the productivity of traits in different tasks.

3.B.

Allowing for Multiple Tasking

More generally, at a point in time, people may perform multiple tasks.40 A less discrete version
of the Roy model builds on the same foundations, allows people to perform multiple tasks at any





time and postulates that  j  , e j is concave and increasing in e j .41 The agent chooses effort
levels e j across the J tasks to maximize total rewards:

38

A straightforward extension works with utilities and not rewards so we define utility U  P1 , , PJ  and the agents

picks the j that maximizes utility, with the other arguments zeroed out. Formally, define d P  1 if a person
j

chooses to perform task j . Array the d P into a vector d P . Array the Pj into a vector P . Realized utility is thus
j



U dP  P



where  is a Hadamard (component-wise) product, i.e. a product of two vectors of the same length

where the operation is such that the result is the product of the first element of one vector with the first element of
the second vector and so forth for each component.
39
See Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006], Cattan [2010], and the evidence in Section 7.
40
This, of course, depends on the time unit. Agents may be able to do only one task at one time if the time unit is
defined finely enough.
41
Failure of concavity can take us back to case I.

As the reward for activity j , R j , increases, everything else constant, the effort devoted
to j will increase.43,44 This model is consistent with effort that compensates for shortfalls in
endowments as well as effort that reinforces initial endowments. The choice of effort depends
on the pattern of complementarity and substitutability. Different situations may be associated
with different rewards for the same task. Such variation can produce differences in performance
across tasks of the sort featured in the person-situation debate discussed in Section 2. One needs
to standardize for the incentives to exert effort across tasks and differences in the endowments of
effort in order to use measurements of performance on tasks to identify traits,  .
3.C.

Identifying Personality Traits

Before considering more general models, it is useful to discuss basic identification problems that
arise in simple settings and that also arise in more general models. At the current level of
generality, all traits can potentially affect productivity in all tasks. However, some tasks may

The first order conditions for this problem are standard: R j

  , and e j  0 , j  1,  , J , where  is the

vector of multipliers associated with the effort constraint. Some people may allocate no effort in some tasks. Pj
may be zero if e j  0 , but this is not strictly required. Again, it is straightforward to generalize this reward function
to a general utility function U  P1 ,, PJ  .
43

 2 j

 0 is a force toward devoting more effort to task j . If effort is complementary with traits in all tasks, as

traits expand, more effort will be expended in those tasks that are relatively more complementary in effort.
In case I, agents will pick j .

44

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
28
require only a single trait or a subset of all of the traits. Following a traditional dichotomy in
psychology that is explicit in Roberts’ Figure 2, divide  into “mental,”  , and “personality,”

 , traits:   and  , each of which may in turn be a vector.45
Psychological measurement systems sometimes use productivity measured in different
tasks to identify   and  .46 This is the way Carroll [1993] defines mental ability where the
task is performance on “mental” tests. To use performance on a task (or on multiple measures of
the task) to identify a trait requires that performance on certain tasks (performance on a test,
performance in an interpersonal situation, etc.) depends exclusively on one component of  , say

1, j . In that case
Pj   j 1, j , e j  .

Even if we can measure productivity Pj in task j , and only one component of  affects Pj , to
identify the level of a trait one must control for the level of effort applied to j in order to use Pj
to infer the level of 1, j . That is, one must standardize for the effort at a benchmark level, say e
, to use P j to identify a measure of the trait that is uniform across different situations that elicit
different levels of effort.47
The activity of picking a task (or a collection of tasks) to measure a particular trait (  1, j
in our example) is called operationalization in psychology. Construct validity refers to whether
or not a purported measure of the trait constructed in the stage of operationalization correlates
45



Effort endowment might also be divided in the same fashion e , e

 , but we do not explicitly develop this

possibility.
46
They also use observer reports and tests which can be interpreted as observation on performance of tasks and
psychometric tasks.
47
A weaker notion is to achieve relative ranks of a trait. One can define the rank of a trait holding fixed the ranks of
all other influences.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
29
with measures deemed to represent the trait. Considerable judgment is required to operationalize
a trait and independently validate it. There is clear danger of circularity. Economists should
carefully scrutinize how the measures they borrow from psychology are operationalized and
validated in that literature. We should not necessarily assume that the measures created in that
field have been rigorously established. We discuss how major constructs are validated in
Section 5.
Assuming that construct validity has been established, if effort is involved in the
performance of a task used to uniquely define a trait, the measurement of performance must be
standardized in order to use measured productivity Pj to identify the trait. Otherwise, the
endowment of effort, and all of the factors that contribute to the exertion of effort, including the
reward to the task, R j , will contaminate the estimate of the trait. Failure to adjust for effort
produces the kind of variability across situations with different rewards that was much discussed
in the person-situation debate. We present examples of such contamination of measurement by
the operation of incentives on effort in Section 5.
Operationalization and construct validation clearly require heroic assumptions. Even if
one adjusts for effort in a task, and thus adjusts for situational specificity, productivity in a task
may depend on multiple traits. Thus two components of  (say 1,  , 1, ) may determine
productivity in task j . Without further information, one cannot infer which of the two traits
produces the productivity in j . But in general, even having two (or more) measures of
productivity that depend on 1,  ,1,  is not enough to identify the separate components.
Consider the following case of two productivity measurements on tasks j and j  :

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
30
Pj   j 1,  , 1, , e j 
Pj    j  1,  , 1, , e j   ,

j  j .

One might have such measurements if data are available on the productivity of the same person
performing two different tasks. Standardize measurements at a common level of effort

e j  e j   e .48 If the functional forms of the  j ·  and  j ·  are known, and the system of
equations satisfies a local rank condition, then one can solve for the pair 1,  , 1,  at e .49
The rank condition might not be satisfied, and the functional forms  j and  j  might not
be known. The productivity functions need not be monotone in 1,  or 1, . Interacting systems
might produce multiple equilibria so that the same values of  produce different values of

( Pj , Pj ) .50 Interacting systems might also have no solution.
Note that even if these problems do not arise, only the pair 1,  , 1,  is identified. One
cannot (without further information) determine which component of the pair is 1,  or 1, . In
Section 5, we present an example where scores on achievement tests depend on both IQ and
personality traits. In the absence of dedicated constructs (constructs that are generated by only
one component of  ), an intrinsic identification problem arises in using measures of productivity

48

Note that if the support of e j and e j  is disjoint, no e exists and so no such standardization is possible.

49

Let   1,  , 1, . Assume that the functional forms of  j · and  j  ·  are known. Formally, a solution from





Pj and Pj  for 1,  and 1, requires that the Jacobian of the system of equations for Pj and Pj 

be non-vanishing in open neighborhoods around any point of solutions for  (see, e.g., Buck [2003]).
Thus there is a correspondence between  Pj , Pj   and  , but no unique functional relationship.

50

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
31
in tasks to infer traits.51 A dedicated measurement for at least one component is an essential
requirement for identification. Other components can be defined relative to that
measurement.52,53
3.D.

Extensions of the Roy Model

Many empirical economists use the simple gross income maximizing framework of the Roy
model to study the effects of personality on outcomes. The model is amended in many papers by
including a cost C j  , e j  for obtaining rewards so that instead of criterion (2), the agent picks ˆj
that maximizes the net reward
ˆj  arg max  R j j  , e   C j  , e  .
j1., J 

In the analogous extension for criterion (3), the agent maximizes

51

There are various ways around this identification problem. For example, one might be able to choose
configurations of data with low (or zero) values of one component. At high levels of effort, induced by a change in
the reward, the effect of one component on productivity might vanish, etc.
52
This problem arises in linear factor models, but it is a more general problem. See, e.g., Anderson and Rubin
[1956] for a definitive treatment of linear factor models. The scales in any factor model are arbitrary and are always
defined with respect to a normalization (i.e. a dedicated measurement that defines the factor). The more general
nonlinear model considered in the text faces the same problem.
53
In general, without knowledge of the functional forms of the  j ·  , j  1,, J , the problem of solving for two
measurements Pj , Pj  to infer 1,  and 1, at a common level of e j  e j  is intractable. Many alternative solutions
are possible. The traditional factor analysis literature reviewed in Section 5 below assumes linearity of the  j · ,

j  1,, J . But even in that literature, attention focuses primarily on identifying the distribution of 1,  , 1,  not

individual values 1, ,1,  when Pj , j  1,, J is measured with error, although methods for solving for

individual values of 1,  , 1,  and correcting for measurement error of the resulting estimates are available in the
literature and are widely applied. (See, e.g., Heckman, Malofeeva, Pinto et al. [2010], Savelyev [2010], Heckman
and Williams [2011].) Cunha, Heckman and Schennach [2010] establish conditions under which it is possible to
nonparametrically identify the functional form of  j · , j  1,, J and the distributions of 1,  , 1,  in the
presence of measurement error on Pj , j  1,, J .

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
32
with respect to the choice of e j . This extension creates a further identification problem—
whether the trait identified arises from its role in costs, productivity, or both. The identification
problem deepens when we allow the costs to be psychic costs as in Heckman and Sedlacek
[1985], Cunha, Heckman and Navarro [2005], or Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006], and
attempt to separate out productivity traits from preference traits.54
The framework of the Roy model is widely used in recent analyses of the role of
personality and cognition.55 It has precedents in the work of Mandelbrot [1962], Heckman and
Sedlacek [1985], and Heckman and Honoré [1990]. In most applications, the  j  , e j  and

C j  , e j  (or their logarithms) are assumed to be linear or log linear in  and e j :

Pj      e e j
C j      e e j .
The analyst models both the choice of the task and the output from the chosen task. A third
(mixed) case can arise in which some clusters of tasks are mutually exclusive so the agent can
perform only one task within each cluster of tasks, but the agent can simultaneously engage in
tasks across clusters.
3.E.

Adding Preferences and Goals

Preferences and goals (see Figure 2) may also shape effort.56 This takes us to a fourth and more
general case. There may be direct utility benefits or costs associated with exerting effort in each

54

Heckman and Navarro [2007] and Abbring and Heckman [2007] present conditions that allow identification of
productivity and costs when there are direct measures of gross productivity, at least when there are measurements on
Pj for individuals who select j .

55

See, e.g., Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006], Heckman, Humphries, Urzua et al. [2010], Báron and Cobb-Clark
[2010], and Cattan [2010].

In some versions of the preceding models with costs, preferences can be embodied in psychic costs.

interpretation, subjective measures of well-being (Layard [2005]) attempt to directly measure

3.F.

Adding Learning and Uncertainty

All of the preceding models can be extended to account for learning and uncertainty. Let  be
the information possessed by the agent, and let “ E ” denote mathematical expectations. An
agent can be interpreted as making decisions based on
(7)

E[U ( X , P, e ∣  ) ∣  ],

where  may be in the agent’s information set (i.e. the agent knows his preferences).
Different theories specify different amounts of information available to agents. They
might be uncertain about their preferences,  , traits,  , the prices they face, W , the rewards to
productivity, R , the outcomes of purchase decisions, X , and their endowments of effort, e , and
the theory can be suitably modified to account for this uncertainty.
The use of the expectations operator begs the question of how agents construct the
information set and how subjective expectations are formed. Psychological traits  may affect
information perception and processing. Several recent studies that apply personality traits to
search economics suggest that agents with a higher perception of the control they have over their
lives have greater confidence in the arrival of job offers.61 Overconfidence may be a trait that
However, the happiness literature is not strictly wedded to the notion that happiness is the same as our U , which
is used only to characterize choice behavior.
60
The model can readily be extended to cover more general cases. There is no need to impose the linear reward
structure (RP) . The resources raised from productive tasks can be a nonlinear in P . Another simple extension of
the model is the case where there is no financial gain from engaging in tasks, but the agent receives a direct utility
benefit from doing so. In this case, constraint (5) is redefined as Y  W  X , but P remains as an argument of the
utility function. One might also introduce goods as inputs into the  j functions.

causes persons to inflate their perceived productivity.62 A production function for information
may depend on components of  ,  , and the effort devoted to acquire information e .
Intelligent people may acquire information more readily than dull people. People more open to
experience likely acquire more knowledge. Aggressive people may reduce their social
interactions and impair their ability to learn from others. We discuss the evidence on how
psychological traits affect information updating in Section 6.
One might object to the rationality and self perception implicit in this formulation. As in
Freud [1909, reprinted 1990], decision making might be made by a subconscious mind lacking
self perception. Decision making may be unconscious and agents may not recognize their
desired goals. Nonetheless, constraints limit their revealed choice behavior. Borghans,
Duckworth, Heckman et al. [2008] develop a model in which agents have random preferences
and make choices at random within their feasible set. Variations in constraints drive the
measured behavior of group averages but do not predict the behavior of any individual.

Definition of Personality Within an Economic Model

Personality traits are the components of e ,  and  that affect behavior. One might define
measured personality as the performance  the Pj  and effort  the e j  that arise from solutions
to any of the optimization problems previously discussed. Thus, the derived productivity and
effort functions would constitute the systems generating measured personality as a response to

62

See, e.g., Akerlof and Dickens [1982] Caplin and Leahy [2001], Köszegi [2006], and Möbius, Niederle, Niehaus
et al. [2010].

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
36
constraints, information, and preferences, i.e. as a system of functions that solve out for the Pj
and e j that agents choose in terms of their choice parameters.63
This approach to defining personality would not capture the full range of behaviors or

actions considered by personality psychologists as constituting manifestations of personality.
The actions considered by psychologists include a variety of activities that economists normally
do not study, e.g., cajoling, beguiling, bewitching, charming, etc. Thus, in selling a house,
various actions might be taken, e.g., smiling, persuading people by reason, threatening, scowling,
showing affection, etc. Actions also include emotions, feelings, and thoughts, and are not
restricted to be activities that promote physical productivity. Colloquially, “there are many ways
to skin a cat,” and the choice of which way to do so in any task defines the action taken.
To capture these more general notions, we introduce the concept of “actions” that are
broader than what is captured by e . Actions are styles of behavior that affect how tasks are
accomplished. They include aspects of behavior that go beyond effort as we have defined it.
Any task can be accomplished by taking various actions. We denote the i th possible
action to perform task



j by a i , j , i  1,...K j  .

Array the actions in a vector



a j  a1, j ,  , a K j , j  . The actions may be the same or different across the tasks. Thus one

can smile in executing all tasks or one may smile in only some. The productivity of the agent in
task j depends on the actions taken in that task:
(8)





Pj   j a1, j , a2, j , ...aK j , j .

The actions themselves depend on traits  and “effort” e i , j :
63

As previously noted in a simpler setting, no solutions may exist or multiple solutions may exist (so there is a
system of correspondences) between traits and personality outcomes.

Less effort may be required to perform a given action if a person has endowment  that favors
performance of the action. For example, a naturally gregarious person may find it easier to
engage in social interactions than others. Stated this way, actions generalize the notion of effort
to a broader class of behavior. Analytically, they play the same role as effort, and some actions
may be components of effort. There may be utility costs or benefits of effort exerted. A special
case arises when there are increasing returns to effort in each action. In that case, the agent will
simply apply all of his effort e j in task j to the action which gives him the highest productivity,
and the other possible actions are not taken.
Agents may have utility over actions beyond the utility derived from consuming the
outputs of tasks. For example, an agent may prefer accomplishing a task by working hard rather
than by cheating. Different beliefs, thoughts, and feelings may have different effects on
outcomes. Introducing actions in this fashion allows for the possibility that some actions are
valued in their own right and do not directly contribute to productivity in any of the J tasks. Let
 be the set of actions, including actions that do not directly contribute to productivity. In this

more general formulation

where    .

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
38
We define utility over actions. Let a denote the choice of actions, some of which may
not be associated with any particular task. Using the same information as used to characterize
(7), the agent solves
max E U  a, X , P, e ∣   ∣  

with respect to X and e given the stated constraints. Actions may also directly affect  , so the
production of information can depend on  , e and a . The choice of which actions to take
depends on goals and values (captured by  ) and on the available information. Part of learning
may consist of agents learning about the set of actions that are available to them,  (  ) .
One can extend the framework to introduce the effects of the situation in the personsituation debate, by considering specific situations represented by h   . These situations are
assumed to affect productivity by affecting the set of possible actions and hence the action taken.
Thus for a person with traits  and effort vector e j with action a i , j , using the specification (9),
the action function can be expanded to be dependent on situation h :
(10)

ai , j , h   i , j ( , ei , j , h),

and productivity on a task can be specified as a function of the action taken to perform the task in
situation h :
(11)

Pj ,h   j (a1, j ,h ,..., aK j , j ,h )

or by a more general specification where situation h , along with traits, has a direct effect on
productivity in addition to their effects on actions taken:

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
39
(12)

Pj ,h   j ( , a1, j ,h ,..., aK j , j ,h , h). 64
Situations could include physical aspects of the environment in which the agent is located

or the network (and other social situations) in which the agent is embodied. The situation can
include social factors such as peer effects.65 Persons taking an achievement test sometimes
perform much worse if they are told that their scores will influence social perceptions of their
group as is found in the stereotype threat literature.66
The situation represents a key notion in the “person-situation” debate discussed in
Section 2. Equations (10)-(12) capture the “if-then” notion of Mischel and Shoda [1995]. Under
specification (12), agents with the same actions, the same efforts, and the same traits may have
different productivities. Failure to control for situation h , just like failure to control for effort,
will contaminate identification of traits using measures of actions or productivities. Situations
may be forced on the agents or may be chosen.67
Let T be the vector of traits  , , e  . At any point in time, traits are endowments.
In the general case, the solution to the constrained maximization problem involves choosing
goods X , the situation h , the actions ai, j , and efforts e j , j  1,  , J  subject to the constraints.

h is fixed if agents cannot choose the situation. For simplicity, we analyze this case. Relaxing
this assumption is straightforward but is notationally more cumbersome.

A more general formulation would treat h   as mutually exclusive descriptions of situations and not claim to
represent all situations by a base set of characteristics and would index all of the  functions by h .

Included in situation h might be the act of being observed by third parties and other possible sources of social

At the cost of further notation, we could make the set of possible situations task-specific.
65

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
40
For the case of fixed h , the solution to the maximization problem produces a set of
response functions.68 Preference parameters   characterize the tradeoffs and goals that help
shape manifest behavior. The agent’s response functions (assumed to exist) are
(13)

X  X  R,W , T , h, Y ,  

(14)

e  e ( R , W , T , h, Y ,  )

(15)

a  a  R,W , T , h, Y ,   .

Productivity P across tasks is derived from the actions, efforts, and traits of the agents.69
The behaviors that constitute personality are defined as a pattern of actions in response to
the constraints, endowments, and incentives facing agents given their goals and preferences.
This interpretation incorporates the notion that personality is a system of functions. People may
have different personalities depending on their trait endowments, constraints, and situations.
Their actions—not the traits—constitute the data used to identify the traits.
Introducing actions widens the set of data from which one might infer the components of

T. Personality psychologists often use actions (e.g., “dispositions”) to infer traits. The same
identification issues previously discussed continue to arise but now apply to a broader set of
measurements.
As noted in the introduction to Section 2, many personality psychologists define
personality as “enduring patterns of thoughts, feelings and behaviors” that reflect tendencies of
persons to respond in certain ways under certain circumstances. Our notion of action a , is broad
enough to encompass the wide array of behaviors considered by the personality psychologists.
We previously defined personality traits T as generators of behavior.

69

The same warnings as previously issued apply. No solutions may exist or they may be multiple valued.
For the case of h chosen, we get a system of derived demands for X , h, ai , j , e j .

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
41
One way to capture the notion of enduring actions is to average the a functions (15) for a
person with a given trait vector T  t over situations and efforts. Thus for a given task j and
trait vector t , the average action for information set  can be defined as
aT , j ,  



 i , j  , ei , j , h  g  h, ei , j | T  ( , , e ), 

 dh de

i, j

,

T , ( h , ei , j )

where T ,  (h, ei , j ) is the support of (h, ei , j ) given T and  , and g  h, ei , j | T  ( , , e ), 

 is

the density of (h, ei , j ) given T  ( , , e ) and information set  . aT , j ,  is the “enduring
action” of agents across situations in task j with information  , i.e., the average personality.
Notice that if  i , j is separable in T , the marginal effect of personality trait vector  is the same
in all situations. One can define the “enduring traits” in a variety of ways, say by averaging over
tasks, j , situations, h , or both. Only under separability will one obtain the same marginal effect
of  . Epstein [1979] and a subsequent literature present evidence against nonseparability and in
favor of an “enduring trait” that is common across situations.

3.H.

Life Cycle Dynamics

The analysis in the preceding subsection was for a particular point in time (e.g., a period). Traits
are not set in stone. In a dynamic setting, one can think of traits, T , information,  , situations,

h , and actions, a , as state variables that evolve through aging, experience, and investment. As a
result of experience (including social interactions), situations, biology (ontogeny), and
investment, traits may change over the life cycle. We briefly discuss the dynamics of trait and
state formation, leaving a more complete discussion to Section 8.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
42
To capture the evidence from a large and growing literature, we consider the dynamic
evolution of traits.70 Let T v be traits at age v , v  1,,V   . Traits may change through
family and self investment (Cunha and Heckman [2007; 2009]), through schooling, through
biology or through experience. Information  v may be updated through various channels of
learning. All task outputs, actions and goods inputs may be time dated.
Investment in period v is an action or set of actions that an individual (or a person or
group acting for the individual) may take in period v . Investments have dynamic effects. The
technology of skill formation (Cunha and Heckman [2007; 2009]) captures the notion that traits
may evolve in response to the inputs of a vector of investments ( IN v ), and through aspects of the
situation in which the agent is found, h v , where h v is the vector of attributes of the situation:
(16)

T v 1   v (

Tv


, IN v , h v ),


v  0, , V  1

self-productivity investment

where the first set of arguments arises from self and cross productivity (skill begets skill; traits
beget other traits and traits cross-foster each other; see Cunha and Heckman [2007; 2009]). The
second set of arguments arises from investment. Investment is a broad concept and includes
parental nurturance, schooling, learning by doing, and learning by imitation, etc. The third set of
arguments arises from the situation in which the person is placed.71
Notice that if elements of T v are augmented over the life cycle through investment and
practice, the actions and efforts required to achieve a given task can change. Thus, if  v , is
enhanced over time, the amount of effort required to perform a task may be reduced. In this

We survey the evidence on the life cycle dynamics of traits in Section 8, focusing primarily on the traits  that
affect measured productivity.
71
The actions taken by agents might also enter as arguments to this technology.

43
way, we can model habit formation and capture the notion of arete, effortless performance of
actions, discussed in Aristotle [1956].72
As emphasized by Mischel and Shoda [1995] and Roberts and Jackson [2008], situations
may change over time as a function of past actions, past situations, investment, information, and
the like. We present this possibility by the following equation of motion:
h v1   v  h v , IN v , a v  .

(17)

Past actions may serve to determine the set of present situations. Those situations in turn may
influence current actions.
Information  v may change over the life cycle through experimentation as well as
through exogenous learning:
 v 1   v   v , a v , T v , IN v , h v  .

(18)

This learning mechanism incorporates the beliefs of agents about the available data. Thus people
may learn about their environments and themselves in part as a consequence of their own actions
and in part as a consequence of the exogenous arrival of information. Equations of motion (16)(18) are very general. We consider special cases of them used in the empirical literature in
Section 8.
A rich and evolving literature investigates dynamic preferences when agents do not
possess full knowledge of their future environments (see, for example, Hansen [2005], Hansen
and Sargent [2008], Rust [2008], Epstein and Zin [1989], Epstein and Schneider [2003], and
Skiadas [1998]). That literature is too large to summarize in this paper. Preferences need not be

72

See Lear [2004]. A habit can be defined as effortless performance of a task, i.e., an action that requires no effort.
It is possible to build a stock of traits to sufficient level that one achieves actions effortlessly.

separable over time, and there may be time inconsistency of choices associated with hyperbolic
discounting.73 We discuss commonly used dynamic preference specifications in Section 6.

3.I.

Relationship of the Model in This Section to Existing Models in Personality
Psychology

Personality psychologists generally do not present formal models. The formalization in this
section is, to our knowledge, the first mathematically precise definition of personality traits and
measured personality. The models we have sketched in this section capture central features of
the major models in personality psychology.
By its authors’ own admission, the McCrae-Costa [2008] Five Factor Theory is not a
fully articulated model. Their model emphasizes the role of traits T  and, in particular, the Big
Five factors, in producing outcomes and agent actions, and is sketchy about other details. Agents
are assumed to learn about their own traits, but precise learning mechanisms are not discussed.
Expression of traits is affected by the external environment and through social interactions in a
not fully specified fashion. The concept of an evolving information set  v plays a central role in
Five Factor Theory. People learn about their traits through actions and experience, but the exact
mechanisms are not precisely formulated. Equation (18) captures these notions. Situations may
also evolve as a function of actions and experience, but no role is assigned to investment in Five
Factor Theory.
Thus, a restricted version of (17) formalizes aspects of the Five Factor Theory. The
theory features “characteristic adaptations,” which correspond to the actions and efforts of our
model that also affect the productivity in tasks. The role of preferences is left unspecified.
However, McCrae and Costa explicitly feature rationality (McCrae and Costa [2008, p. 161])
73

See Kirby and Herrnstein [1995] and Gul and Pesendorfer [2004].

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
45
and reject the characterization of flawed human decision making that dominates social
psychology and the field of behavioral economics that was spawned from social psychology.
They explicitly reject a purely situationist explanation of the origin of actions, but they allow for
situations to affect actions. Traits evolve through biological processes (ontogeny), but
investment or experience do not affect the evolution of traits. Thus, the arguments of equation
(16) are shut down, but traits may still exogenously evolve as a function of age and the biology
of the individual. Even though traits evolve as part of an exogeneous maturation process,
persons may learn about themselves (their traits) by taking actions and by being acted on by the
external environment.
“Social cognitive” theories are rivals to trait theories based on the Big Five.74 Albert
Bandura, Daniel Cervone, and Walter Mischel are central figures in this literature. Roberts’
diagram (Figure 2) captures key aspects of this theory, and Roberts himself can be viewed as a
member of both camps. This line of thinking stresses the role of cognition in shaping personality
and the role of social context in shaping actions and self-knowledge. Authors writing in this
school of thought reject the “cognitive-noncognitive” distinction that is often used in economics.
They view manifest personality as an outcome of cognitive processes. A major role is assigned
to agency—individual goals and motives that produce actions. Their goals and motives are
captured by our  . The arrival of information is captured by  . Although the literature in
personality psychology often contrasts these two schools of thought, to us the lines are not
distinct. Only in one extreme version of the social-cognitive theory are traits are entirely absent.
In that version, agent behavior is entirely shaped by situations. For example, Mischel and Shoda
[2008] focus on the role of situation in shaping actions, efforts, and productivities, but also allow
74

See Cervone and Pervin [2009].

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
46
for traits to influence actions. The “sociogenomic” model of Roberts and Jackson [2008] also
considers the dynamics of personality formation.
Thus, both schools of thought accept specification (9) or its extension (10), and both
would be comfortable with response systems (13)-(15). The relative importance of the factors
emphasized by the two schools of thought can only be settled by empirical research. The socialcognitive theorists tolerate deviations from rationality in their theories, while trait theorists
typically do not.
Both schools of thought entertain the possibility of learning about oneself. A major
difference between the two groups comes in the role of investment in producing traits. The
social-cognitive theorists feature investment and social interactions as direct determinants of
traits that are assumed to evolve as a function of the experiences of agents. The trait theorists do
not consider this possibility. Instead they emphasize self-learning about traits that evolve by
fixed biological principles unrelated to the experiences of individuals.75

75

Cervone [2004] contrasts the two schools of thought.

Measuring Personality

Unlike other personal traits, like height or weight, personality traits cannot be directly measured.
Observed productivities, efforts, and actions are used to infer traits. This leads directly to the
analysis of latent variables and to factor models that underlie much of the analysis of trait
psychology. This is an area where psychology and the econometrics of measurement error, and
latent variables more generally, fruitfully interact. Factor models underlie the concepts of
validity of measurements that are used in psychology.

4.A.

Linear Factor Models

Linear factor models are widely used in personality psychology and in psychometric models for
mental test scores. We review the use of these models in psychology. Versions are already in
widespread use in economics.76 To capture essential points, we abstract from a lot of the issues
discussed in Section 3. We consider measurements arising from productivity in tasks. We thus
focus solely on outputs of tasks, abstracting from actions, efforts, and situations. With suitable
extensions of the notation used here, we can extend the factor model to the more general models
discussed in Section 3.
We assume additive separability of the arguments of equation (1). The stripped down
model writes task performance of person n on task j , Pn , j , based on traits Tn in the following
manner:
(19)

76

Pn , j   j   jTn   n , j , n  1,, N , j  1, , J ,

See, e.g., Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006], Heckman, Humphries, Urzua et al. [2010], Piatek and Pinger
[2010], Cattan [2010], and Cunha and Heckman [2008].

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
48
where  j is the mean productivity in the jth task,  j is a vector of factor loadings, and n, j is
other determinants of measured performance, including measurement errors. The number of
components in Tn , L, has to be small relative to J ( L  J ) for the factor model to have any
explanatory power. Otherwise for each task one can create a unique factor and the model
becomes tautological. A purely cognitive task would be associated with zero values of the
components of vector  j on elements of Tn that are associated with personality traits. Factor
model (19) captures the notions that: (a) latent traits Tn generate a variety of outcomes, (b) task
outputs are imperfect measures of the traits Tn  because n, j also determines task output, and
(c) tasks other than tests or observer reports may also proxy the underlying traits, i.e., latent traits
generate both test scores and behaviors. A correlation of outcomes across tasks can arise
because tasks depend on the same vector of traits.77 Outcomes across tasks may be correlated
even if the components of Tn are not.78
4.B.

Discriminant and Convergent Validity

In this simplified framework, most personality psychologists focus on observer- and self-reports
as measures of Pn , j . The measurements are designed to capture a particular trait. As discussed
in Section 3, the choice of which collection of tasks is used to measure a capability
(“operationalization and construct validity”) is an inherently subjective activity. Many
psychologists take a pragmatic, empirical point of view. Traits are what the measurements used
77

The strength of the correlation depends on the magnitudes of  j and  j  across the two tasks, j and j .

78

Cunha, Heckman and Schennach [2010] present a nonparametric identification analysis for a general nonseparable
model allowing for measurement error in measures of performance. In the notation of equation (19), they
nonparametrically identify the distribution of Tn and the distribution of n, j , j  1,, J , the latter without
assuming full independence among the measurement errors.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
49
capture.79 The danger with this empiricist definition is that it offers no guide to the choice of
measurements, which are usually settled by conventions or intuitions.
The concept of “discriminant validity” of a collection of tasks (e.g., a set of test scores or
a set of observer reports or measurements of productivities) is commonly used to test for
construct validity. This approach exploits the notion that a particular battery of measurements
captures a component of Tn , for example, Tn , l , and not other components. Many measurements
may be taken on Tn , l , and having multiple measurements helps to control for measurement error.
All measurements are really just outcomes on a type of task although the effort applied
may vary greatly across tasks. The literature in psychology usually assigns a special status to
tests, self-reports, and observer-reports of latent traits, but also uses direct measures of
productivity, such as supervisor ratings.80 Behaviors, tests, observer reports, and self reports all
can be used to proxy the underlying traits. These include repeated measurements on the same
types of assessment mechanisms as well as measurements on different behaviors and
assessments that are assumed to be generated by common traits.81
A standard approach to defining constructs in personality psychology is based on factor
analysis. This approach takes a set of measurements that are designed to capture a construct, and
measures within-cluster and across-cluster correlations of the measurements to isolate latent
factors Tn ,l , l  1, , L or their distributions. The measurements and clusters of tests are selected
on intuitive grounds or a priori grounds, and not on the basis of any predictive validity in terms
of real-world outcomes (for example, success in college, performance on the job, earnings). This
79

Borsboom, Mellenbergh and van Heerden [2003] compare the approach taken in Section 3 of defining traits a
priori within a model with the operationalist approach (Bridgman [1959]) of defining a trait by whatever
measurements are available on it. Operationalism begs the question of operationalization and construct validity.
80
See Groth-Marnat [2009].
81
Different measurements may load onto different traits.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
50
process gave rise to the taxonomy of traits that became the Big Five. Because of the somewhat
arbitrary basis of these taxonomies, there is some controversy in psychology about competing
construct systems which we discuss in Section 5. In practice, as we document below, the
requirement of independence of the latent factors across constructs (lack of correlation of tests
across clusters) is not easily satisfied.82 This fuels controversy among psychologists advocating
competing taxonomies.
To state these issues more formally, let Pnq,l be the qth measurement on trait l for person

n . Using a linear factor representation, the qth measurement of factor l for person n can be
represented as
(20)

Pnq,l  lq  lqTn ,l  nq,l ,
q  1,..., Ql ,

n  1,..., N ,

l  1,..., L .

The factor Tn , l is assumed to be statistically independent of the “measurement errors,” nq,l ,

q  1,..., Ql . Different factors are assumed to be independent ( Tn ,l independent of Tn ,l  for
l  l  ). The measurement errors (or “uniquenesses”) are usually assumed to be mutually
independent within and across constructs.83
In fact, measurement Pnq,l may depend on other components of Tn , so that the
measurement captures a composite of latent traits. A more general case is
(21)

82

Pnq,l  lq    q  Tn  nq,l ,


q  1,..., Ql ,

Indeed, as documented in Section 7, the factors associated with personality are also correlated with some
measures of cognitive factors but not all.
83
The literature in economics relaxes the independence assumptions. See Cunha and Heckman [2008] and Cunha,
Heckman and Schennach [2010] and the literature they cite. They present conditions under which independence is
substantially weakened and identification of factors is still possible.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
51
where  q is a vector with possibly as many as L nonzero components. The nq,l are assumed to
be independent of Tn and mutually independent within and across constructs ( l and l  are two
constructs). The task has discriminant validity for trait l if the only nonzero component of  q is
84
 lq . The  lq and  lq can depend on measured characteristics of the agent, Qn . The task has

convergent validity if measures within the construct are highly correlated.
More precisely, conventional psychometric validity of a collection of items or test scores
for different constructs has three aspects. (a) Factor Tl for construct l is statistically
independent of factor Tl  for construct l   l , discriminant validity.85 (b) A factor Tl is assumed
to account for the intercorrelations among the items or tests within a construct l . (c) Itemspecific and random error variance are low (intercorrelations among items are high within a
cluster).86 Criteria (b) and (c) define convergent validity.87
4.C.

Predictive Validity

An alternative criterion for validating measurement systems is based on the predictive power of
the tests for real world outcomes, that is, on behaviors measured outside of the exam room or
observer system. The Hogan Personality Inventory,88 the California Personality Inventory, and
the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory were all developed with the specific purpose of

84

Hansen, Heckman and Mullen [2004] show how to allow Qn to depend on Tl and still identify the model

85

This is sometimes weakened to a condition of zero correlation.
Cronbach’s alpha is a widely used measure of intercorrelation among test scores, that is, a measure of importance

86

q

of the variance of the n,l uniquenesses relative to the variance of the factors. See Hogan, Hogan and Roberts
[1996] for a precise definition. Sijtsma [2009] discusses the severe limitations of Cronbach’s alpha.
Nothing in these standard testing procedures guarantees that the measurements that satisfy convergent and
discriminant validity identify a single trait. Multiple traits operating in the same fashion across many outcomes
would produce outcomes and factors that satisfy the criteria. The multiple traits would be captured into a single
factor. Only if different traits differentially affect different outcomes can one identify different traits.

predicting real-world outcomes. Decisions to retain or drop items during the development of
these inventories were based, at least in part, upon the ability of items to predict such outcomes.
This approach has an appealing concreteness about it. Instead of relying on abstract a priori
notions about domains of personality and subjectively defined latent factors generated from test
scores and self and observer personality assessments, it anchors measurements in tangible, realworld outcomes and constructs explicit tests with predictive power. Yet this approach has its
own problems.
First, all measurements of factor T n , l can claim incremental predictive validity as long as
each measurement is subject to error  nq, l  0  . Proxies for Tn , l can appear to be separate
determinants (or “causes”) instead of surrogates for an underlying one-dimensional construct or
factor. Thus suppose that measurement system (20) is the correct specification and that a set of
measurements display both convergent and discriminant validity. As long as there are
measurement errors for construct l , there is no limit to the number of proxies for Tn , l that will
show up as statistically significant predictors of an outcome.89 For this reason, it is necessary to
correct for measurement error in using predictive validity to identify and measure traits.
A second problem with this approach to validation is reverse causality. This is especially
problematic when interpreting correlations between personality measurements and outcomes.
Outcomes may influence personality measures as well as the other way around. For example,
self-esteem might increase income, and income might increase self-esteem. Measuring
personality traits prior to measuring predicted outcomes does not necessarily solve this problem.
For example, the anticipation of a future pay raise may increase present self-esteem.
89

This is a standard result in the econometrics of measurement error. See, e.g., Aigner, Hsiao, Kapteyn et al.
[1984].

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
53
Psychologists sometimes address the problem of reverse causality by using early
measures of traits determined well before the outcomes are measured to predict later outcomes.90
This approach is problematic if the traits the analyst seeks to identify evolve over time and the
contemporary values of traits drive behavior. This practice trades a reverse causality problem
with a version of an errors in variables problem. Early measures of the traits may be poor
proxies for the traits that drive measured current behavior. In our review of the literature in
Section 7, we distinguish studies that attempt to control for reverse causality and those that do
not.
Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006] and Urzua [2008] demonstrate the importance of
correcting for reverse causality arising from schooling affecting traits and traits affecting
schooling in interpreting the effects of personality tests on a variety of socioeconomic outcomes.
Application of econometric techniques for determining the causal effects of factors on outcomes
makes a distinctive contribution to psychology.
Many psychologists focus on prediction, not causality.91 Establishing predictive validity
will often be enough to achieve the goal of making personnel assignment and student placement
decisions.92 However, for policy analysis, including analyses of new programs designed to
augment the skills of the disadvantaged, causal models are required in order to generate policy
counterfactuals.93
The papers of Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006] and Cunha and Heckman [2008],
develop frameworks for circumventing the problems that arise in using predictive validity to
90

This approach is based on the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy.
There is a long tradition in psychology of conducting predictive analysis based on factor analysis (see, for
example, the essays in Cudeck and MacCullum [2007]), but there is no systematic treatment of the problem of
reverse causality in that field.

91

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
54
define and measure personality constructs. These frameworks recognize the problem of
measurement error in the proxies for constructs. Constructs are created on the basis of how well
latent factors predict outcomes not direct measures. They develop frameworks for testing

discriminant validity. They allow the factors across different clusters of constructs to be
correlated and show how to test for the presence of correlations across the factors.
They use an extension of factor analysis to represent proxies for low-dimensional factors.
They test for the number of latent factors required to fit the data and rationalize the proxies.94
Generalizing the analysis of Hansen, Heckman and Mullen [2004], Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua
[2006] allow for lifetime experiences and investments to determine, in part, the coefficients of
the factor model and to affect the factor itself. Cunha, Heckman and Schennach [2010] and
Cunha and Heckman [2008] allow for the latent factor to determine investment and experience.
They correct estimates of latent factors on outcomes for the effects of spurious feedback, and
separate proxies from factors. The factors are estimated to change over the life cycle as a
consequence of experience and investment. We review these studies in Sections 7 and 8.
4.D.

Faking

“Faking” may corrupt measurements designed to proxy latent factors. There are at least two
types of false responses: those arising from impression management and those arising from selfdeception (Paulhus [1984]). For example, individuals who know that their responses on a
personality questionnaire will be used to make hiring decisions may deliberately exaggerate their
strengths and downplay their weaknesses.95 Subconscious motives to see themselves as virtuous
may produce the same faking behavior, even when responses are anonymous. It is possible to
94

Conti, Heckman, Lopes et al. [2010] discuss alternative approaches to selecting the number of latent factors. See
also Cragg and Donald [1997].
95
See Viswesvaran and Ones [1999]; and Sternberg [2001; Sternberg, Forsythe, Hedlund et al. [2000].

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
55
fake Conscientiousness on a self-report questionnaire, whereas it is impossible to fake superior
reasoning ability on an IQ test. To a lesser degree, a similar bias may also operate in cognitive
tests. Persons who know that their test scores will affect personnel or admissions decisions may
try harder. The literature on “stereotype threat” shows that the framing of an achievement test
can affect the performance of the test taker.96 Some evidence suggests that faking has a
surprisingly minimal effect on predicting job performance.97 Correcting for faking using scales
designed to measure deliberate lying does not seem to improve predictive validity.98
Nevertheless, when measuring cognitive and personality traits, as noted in Section 3, one should
standardize for incentives and environment.
The linear factor model does not capture a variety of interesting interactions among traits.
Cunha, Heckman and Schennach [2010] and the papers they cite develop a nonlinear non-normal
factor analysis that allows for measurement errors to be correlated across measures and over
time. We report estimates based on their nonlinear factor analyses in Section 8.
4.E.

The Causal Status of Latent Variables

Some psychologists question the causal status of latent variables extracted from factor analyses
of measurements across individuals.99 Such factor analytic studies summarize interindividual
variation but do not necessarily inform analysts about the effects of exogenously changing the
factor in producing outcomes across individuals. In addition, variations of traits within persons
may have very different effects than variations across persons.

96

56
The distinction between the effects of changing traits within and across persons is
traditional in econometrics.100 Econometric models that capture this distinction could be
fruitfully applied to psychology. So can hierarchical linear models.101
These methods do not address the deeper problem that most of the estimates of “the
effects” of psychological traits on outcomes (either from “within” or “across” studies) have no
causal status. Structural equation methods have been used to estimate causal relationships using
cross-person variation. They rely on the usual toolkit of simultaneous equations exclusion
restrictions to secure identification.102 Standard experimental and econometric techniques for
inferring causality from within person changes have only recently been applied to generate
causal effects of personality.103 We review this literature in Section 8.

Implementing the Measurement Systems

How do psychologists measure individual differences? In this section we analyze the major
measurement systems for cognition and personality. We examine the relative performance of
cognition and personality in predicting a variety of outcomes. For cognition, there is a fairly
well-established set of terminologies and conventions. Aptitude tests are designed to measure
differences in the rates at which individuals learn (i.e., fluid intelligence). Achievement tests are
designed to measure acquired knowledge (i.e., crystallized intelligence). For personality, a
variety of alternative measurement systems are proposed, and this is a source of confusion. We
attempt to compare and equate these systems of measurement. We link them to measures of
childhood temperament and psychopathology which are also used to describe individual
differences. We note that the problems of operationalization and construct validity are present in
analyzing any measures of traits.

5.A.

Cognition

Intelligence (also called cognitive ability and general mental ability) is defined by psychologists
to include the “ability to understand complex ideas, to adapt effectively to the environment, to
learn from experience, to engage in various forms of reasoning, to overcome obstacles by taking
thought” (Neisser, Boodoo, Bouchard et al. [1996, p. 77]).104 These are clearly distinct traits,
and the literature distinguishes more finely among them. The term “IQ” is often used
synonymously with intelligence but in fact refers specifically to scores on intelligence tests.
104

Psychologists have attempted to broaden the concept of intelligence beyond this list. Most notably, Gardner
[2004] suggests that the notion of intelligence should also include creativity and the ability to solve practical, realworld problems. He includes in his theory of multiple intelligences, musical intelligence, kinaesthetic intelligence,
and interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence, among others.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
58
Notwithstanding a century of active study and general agreement about the sorts of tasks on
which more intelligent individuals perform better, the construct of intelligence “resists a
consensual definition.”105
Scores on different tests of cognitive ability tend to be highly correlated, with half or
more of the variance of diverse tests accounted for by a single general factor labeled “g” and
more specific mental abilities loading on other factors.106 g is widely interpreted as general
mental ability.107 An extreme version of g-theory that is no longer widely accepted is that g
accounts for all the correlation among different tests of cognition.108
Psychometricians have expanded this notion to create a hierarchy of “orders.” The order
of a factor indicates its generality in explaining a variety of tests of cognitive ability deemed to
satisfy construct validity. Tests have different emphases (for example, verbal ability, numeracy,
coding speed, and other tasks). A first-order factor is predictive in all cognitive tasks, j=1,..., J
in equation (19). In modern parlance this general correlation is called “ g ,” but it is no longer
viewed as the sole predictor of cognitive test scores. A lower-order factor is predictive of
performance in only some tasks. Lower-order factors can be correlated with the higher-order
factors and may be correlated with each other. They have independent predictive power from the
higher-order factors. Figure 3 reports one possible partition of general intelligence due to
Ackerman and Heggestad [1997], who summarize the work of Carroll [1993] on the multiple
facets of intelligence.109

Fluid vs. Crystallized Intelligence
There is less agreement about the number and identity of lower-order factors.110 Carroll [1993]
proposed a general intelligence factor g and several more specific second-order factors,
including, but not limited to, what Cattell [1971; 1987] dubbed crystallized and fluid
intelligence. Crystallized intelligence, Cattell proposed, comprises acquired skills and knowledge
and thus is partly dependent upon educational opportunity and motivation. Fluid intelligence, by
contrast, is a general “relation-perceiving ability” (p. 138). Cattell’s student Rindermann [2007]
elaborates:
“Fluid intelligence is the ability to perceive complex relations, educe complex

correlates, form concepts, develop aids, reason, abstract, and maintain span of
immediate apprehension in solving novel problems in which advanced elements of
the collective intelligence of the culture were not required for solution” (p. 462).
In contrast, crystallized intelligence is the same class of skills, “but in materials in which past
appropriation of the collective intelligence of the culture would give one a distinct advantage in
solving the problems involved” (p. 462).
Carroll [1993] and Horn and McArdle [2007] summarize the large body of evidence
against the claim that a single factor g is sufficient to explain the correlation structure of
achievement and intelligence tests. 111 Two pieces of evidence are worth highlighting. First,
crystallized intelligence tends to increase monotonically for most of the life cycle, whereas fluid
110

Carroll [1993] analyzed 477 data sets and estimated a structure with g as the highest-order factor, eight secondorder ability clusters, and over 70 more narrowly defined third-order abilities on a variety of different tests.
Alternative hierarchical models, also with g as the highest-order factor, have been proposed (for example, Lubinski
[2004]; Horn [1970]).
111
Recent research by Ardila, Pineda and Rosselli [2000] shows that more than one factor is required to summarize
the predictive power of cognitive tests in economic data. This could be due to the existence of multiple intellective
factors or because personality factors affect the measurement of cognitive factors as we discuss later on in this
section.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
61
intelligence tends to peak in very early adulthood then to decline.112 Second, the well-known
Flynn effect, which documents the population-wide increase in performance on intelligence tests
over the past half-century, is particularly dramatic for measures of fluid intelligence but much
smaller for measures of crystallized intelligence.113 SAT scores have declined rather than
increased over the same period, requiring a renorming in the 1990s.
The relative weighting of fluid versus crystallized intelligence varies among tests
according to the degree to which prior experience is crucial to performance. These second order
factors are correlated with the first-order factor g but also contribute additional explanatory
power to predicting some clusters of test score outcomes. Achievement tests, like the Armed
Forces Qualifying Test used by economists and psychologists alike, are heavily weighted
towards crystallized intelligence,114 whereas tests like the Raven Progressive Matrices [1962] are
heavily weighted towards fluid intelligence.115 Several studies have shown that fluid intelligence
is much more strongly related to g than are measures of crystallized intelligence.116 Moreover,
lay intuitions of intelligence (i.e., what most people mean by “being smart”) correspond more
closely with the ability to learn than with possession of already acquired knowledge.117 Thus, it
seems to us useful to reserve the term “intelligence tests” for tests that primarily measure fluid
intelligence, and the term “achievement tests” for tests that primarily measure crystallized
intelligence. Some would argue that g has been usurped by fluid intelligence. A closer reading

Raven, Raven and Court [1988 ]. Conti and Pudney [2007] uses data on intelligence and achievement tests
across nations to show that a single factor accounts for 94-95 percent of the variance across both kinds of tests. The
high correlation between intelligence and achievement tests is in part due to the fact that both require cognitive
ability and knowledge, even if to different degrees, that common developmental factors may affect both of these
traits, and that fluid intelligence promotes the acquisition of crystallized intelligence.

is that what is commonly meant by intelligence encompasses a number of distinct traits captured
in the lower order factors of Figure 3.

Predictive Validity of Tests of Cognition
How well do IQ and achievement tests predict success in life? This is a hard question to answer.
Many different skills are required to achieve success in any task.118 Different tasks in life require
different skills in different degrees.119 Table 2 shows the domains of validation and the
estimated validities of a number of widely used tests of cognition. Notice that the domains of
validation differ greatly. For IQ tests, the validities are usually established by comparing test
scores with other test scores or with grades in school and not success in life. Nevertheless, it is
well-established that standardized tests of ability and achievement predict objectively measured
academic, occupational, and life outcomes.120
The SAT college entrance exam is moderately successful in predicting grades in
college—which was what the SAT was designed to do.121 However, high school grades are
better predictors of college performance.122 The rival American College Test (ACT) is validated
in a similar fashion but uses somewhat broader measures of college performance, such as grades
in higher years of college rather than just freshman year grades.123 The Graduate Record Exam
is validated by performance in graduate school.124 The Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT) is
validated by performance in the military. Performance is measured by success in military

Personality Traits

We have noted in Sections 2 and 3 that sharp contrasts between cognition and personality are not
easy to make. Consider, for example, the so-called “quasi-cognitive” traits (Kyllonen, Walters
and Kaufman [2005]). These include creativity (Csikszentmihalyi [1996]), emotional intelligence
(Mayer and Salovey [1997]), cognitive style (Stanovich [1999]; Perkins and Tishman [2001]),
typical intellectual engagement (Ackerman and Heggestad [1997]), and practical intelligence
(Sternberg, Forsythe, Hedlund et al. [2000]). Furthermore, the Big Five factor of Openness to
Experience has as facets curiosity (“ideas”) and imagination (“fantasy”) that are often associated
with intellect and measured intelligence.127 (See the entries under Openness in Table 3.) We
note in Section 5.C that personality can affect performance on tests of fluid intelligence.
Personality traits also affect acquired skills and knowledge (i.e., crystallized intelligence).128 A
general pattern is higher correlation of personality tests with tests of crystallized knowledge (e.g.,
achievement tests).129 For many personality traits and for measures of cognition that are based
on fluid intelligence, the correlations are close to zero, as we note below.
Finally, consider the construct of executive function. “Cognitive control” and “executive
function” are terms used interchangeably, primarily in the neuroscience literature. Both have
been defined as the voluntary, effortful blocking of a habitual behavior in order to execute a less
familiar behavior.130 Some authors (e.g., Gray [2004]) also use the terms “cognitive control” and
“self-control” interchangeably, though self-control is traditionally considered a personality trait
rather than an aspect of cognition. While tasks requiring executive function are related to
127

McCrae and Costa [1997a]; Noftle and Robins [2007].
See Chamorro-Premuzic and Furnham [2005] for an extended discussion of this topic.

66
questionnaire measures of self-control, the size of these associations is only about

r  0.11 to 0.14 .(Duckworth and Schulze [2009]).
A region of the brain called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), in conjunction with
the nearby region called the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), are now understood as responsible
for “executive control” over lower order processes.131 That is, executive control entails topdown, intentional control of behavior and is not necessary for the performance of simple,
automatic tasks (Miller and Cohen [2001]). The PFC achieves structural and functional maturity
later than other (e.g., sensorimotor) brain regions (Casey, Tottenham, Liston et al. [2005]).
Specific executive functions attributed to the PFC include abstract reasoning, planning, decision
making, working memory (the ability to keep the facts of a problem at hand), attention, conflict
monitoring, task switching, and inhibition of prepotent (i.e., dominant, habitual) impulses. While
many functions have been attributed to the PFC, Miller [2000] notes that “there is little
agreement on the cardinal prefrontal functions” (p. 449). Nevertheless, there is some consensus
that one can distinguish between working memory on the one hand, and response inhibition and
task switching on the other (Garon, Bryson and Smith [2008], Miyake, Friedman, Emerson et al.
[2000]). This distinction is important because working memory is highly related to performance
on measures of fluid intelligence.132 Being able to access to all of the data about a problem is
helpful in solving it. Thus, working memory is a common component of the constructs of both
executive function and general intelligence.133
While the construct of executive function demonstrates the inadequacy of terms such as
“cognitive” and “non-cognitive”, many personality traits nevertheless are conceptually and

empirically easily distinguished from general cognitive ability. Most personality traits are in fact
very weakly correlated with IQ (Webb [1915]; McCrae and Costa [1994]; Stankov [2005];
Ackerman and Heggestad [1997]). Thus, regardless of the terms used to describe individual
differences that determine life outcomes, one thing is clear: human ability entails more than
intelligence. Personality traits, however defined, do matter, and they have independent predictive
power from standard measures of intelligence.
5.C.

Operationalizing the Concepts

Intelligence tests are routinely used in a variety of settings including business, education, civil
service, and the military.134 Psychometricians attempt to use test scores to measure a factor (a
component of T in the notation of Section 4). The working hypothesis in the intelligence testing
business is that specific tests measure only a single component of T , and that tests with different
“content domains” measure different components. We first discuss the origins of the
measurement systems for intelligence and we then discuss their validity.135

IQ Tests
Modern intelligence tests have been used for just over a century, beginning with the decision of a
French minister of public instruction to identify retarded pupils in need of specialized education
programs. In response, Alfred Binet created the first IQ test.136 Other pioneers in intelligence
testing include Cattell [1890] and Galton [1883], both of whom developed tests of basic
cognitive functions (for example, discriminating between objects of different weights). These
134

Siegler [1992] provide a detailed overview of the different types of applications of psychological testing.
See Roberts, Markham, Matthews et al. [2005] for a more complete history of intelligence testing.
136
In 1904, La Société Libre pour l’Etude Psychologique de l’Enfant appointed a commission to create a mechanism
for identifying these pupils in need of alternative education led by Binet. See Herrnstein and Murray [1994] for an
overview of Binet’s life and work.
135

68
early tests were eventually rejected in favor of tests that attempt to tap higher mental processes.
Terman [1916] adapted Binet’s IQ test for use with American populations. Known as the
Stanford-Binet IQ test, Terman’s adaptation was, like the original French test, used primarily to
predict academic performance. Stanford-Binet test scores were presented as ratios of mental age
to chronological age multiplied by 100. IQ scores centered at 100 as the average are now
conventional for most intelligence tests.
Wechsler [1939] noted two major limitations of the Stanford-Binet test. First, it was
overly reliant on verbal skills and, therefore, dependent upon formal education and cultural
exposure. Second, the ratio of mental to chronological age was an inappropriate metric for adults
(Boake [2002]). Wechsler created a new intelligence test battery divided into verbal subtests
(e.g., similarities) and performance subtests (e.g., block design, matrix reasoning). He also
replaced the ratio IQ score with deviation scores that have the same normal distribution at each
age. This test, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)—and, later, the Wechsler
Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)—produces two different IQ subscores, verbal IQ and
performance IQ, which sum to a full-scale IQ score. The WAIS and the WISC have for the past
several decades been by far the most commonly used IQ tests.
Similar to Wechsler’s Matrix Reasoning subtest, the Raven Progressive Matrices test is a
so-called “culture-free” IQ test because it does not depend heavily on verbal skills or other
knowledge explicitly taught during formal education. Each matrix test item presents a pattern of
abstract figures.137 The test taker must choose the missing part.138 If subjects have not had
exposure to such visual puzzles, the Raven test is an almost pure measure of fluid intelligence.
However, the assumption that subjects are unfamiliar with such puzzles is not typically tested. It

69
is likely that children from more educated families or from more developed countries have more
exposure to such abstract puzzles (Blair [2006]). Our view is that to varying degrees, IQ and
achievement tests reflect fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, and personality factors, such
as motivation, to succeed on the test. We offer evidence on the effect of motivation on test
scores below in Section 5.E.
5.D.

Personality Constructs

Dominant theories of personality assume a hierarchical structure analogous to that found for
intelligence. However, despite early efforts to identify a g for personality (for example, Webb
[1915]), even the most parsimonious personality models incorporate more than one factor. The
most widely accepted taxonomy of personality traits is the Big Five.139 The Big Five factors are
obtained from conventional factor analysis using a version of (19) where the “tests” are measures
of different domains of personality based on observer reports or self reports.
The five-factor model has its origins in Allport and Odbert’s [1936] lexical hypothesis,
which posits that the most important individual differences are encoded in language. Allport and
Odbert combed English dictionaries and found 17,953 personality-describing words, which were
later reduced to 4,504 personality-describing adjectives. Subsequently, several different
psychologists working independently and on different samples concluded that personality traits
can be organized into five superordinate factors.
Table 3 presents the Big Five factors that were discussed in Section 2. It summarizes the
30 lower-level facets (six facets for each of five factors) identified in the Revised NEO
Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R, Costa and McCrae [1992b]). The acronym is shorthand for

Neuroticism, Extroversion, Openness to Experience—Personality Inventory—Revised. Of

70
course, these lower-level facets (e.g., “impulsive”) can be further subdivided into even more
narrow traits (“impulsive about junk food,” “impulsive about smoking”). The more narrowly
defined a trait, the more specific are the contexts in which the trait is predictive. In parentheses in
the third column of Table 3, we have included a strongly related trait adjective. In the fourth
column of Table 3, we present other traits in each family. In the fifth column, we relate the Big
Five to children’s temperament traits studied by developmental psychologists.

Temperament is the term used by developmental psychologists to describe the behavioral
tendencies of infants and children.140 Because individual differences in temperament emerge so
early in life, these traits have traditionally been assumed to be biological (as opposed to
environmental) in origin.141 However, findings in behavioral genetics suggest that, like adult
personality, temperament is only partly heritable, and as discussed in Section 8, both adult and
child measured traits are affected by the environment.
Temperament is studied primarily by child and developmental psychologists, while
personality is studied by adult personality psychologists. The past decade has seen some
convergence of these two research traditions, however, and there is evidence that temperamental
differences observed during the preschool years anticipate adult personality and interpersonal
functioning decades later (for example, Caspi [2000]; Newman, Caspi, Moffitt et al. [1997];
Shiner and Caspi [2003]). Column 5 of Table 3 displays temperament traits that have been
associated both theoretically and empirically with adult personality traits.
Historically, many temperament researchers examined specific lower-order traits rather
than broader, higher-level factors that characterize studies of adult intelligence and
personality.142 Shiner [1998] suggests that “there is therefore a great need to bring order to this
vast array of studies of single lower-level traits” (p. 320). Recently, taxonomies of temperament
140

See Caspi and Shiner [2006] and Zentner and Bates [2008] for a discussion of varying perspectives on
temperament, including a summary of points where major theorists converge.
141
Indeed, some psychologists use the term “temperament” to indicate all aspects of personality that are biological
in origin. They study temperament in both children and adults.
142
Measuring temperament presents unique methodological challenges. Self-report measures, by far the most widely
used measure for adult personality, are not appropriate for young children for obvious reasons. One strategy is to ask
parents and teachers to rate the child’s overt behavior (for example, California Child Q-sort), but informants can
only guess what a child might be thinking and feeling. Infants present a special challenge because their behavioral
repertoire is so limited. One strategy is to place infants in a standard situation and code reactions under a
standardized scenario (for example, the Strange Situation, which is used to distinguish infants who are securely
attached to their caregiver versus insecurely attached). Young children can be interviewed using puppets or stories.
For obvious reasons, all measures of temperament are more difficult and more expensive to collect than adult selfreport measures. This may explain the absence of large-sample studies of child temperament.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
73
have been proposed that group lower-order traits into higher-order dimensions; several of these
taxonomies resemble the Big Five (for example, John, Caspi, Robins et al. [1994]; Putnam, Ellis
and Rothbart [2001]; Rothbart, Ahadi and Evans [2000]; Shiner and Caspi [2003]). However,
compared to adults, there seem to be fewer ways that young children can differ from one another.
Child psychologists often refer to the “elaboration” or “differentiation” of childhood
temperament into the full flower of complex, adult personality. The lack of direct
correspondence between measures of temperament and measures of adult personality presents a
challenge to researchers interested in documenting changes in personality over the full life cycle.
Developing the required measures is an active area of research.

Alternatives to the Big Five
The Five-Factor model is not without its critics. Alternative systems have been proposed. For
example, Eysenck [1991] offers a model with just three factors (i.e., Neuroticism, Extraversion,
and Psychoticism). Cloninger [1987] and Tellegen [1985] offer different three-factor models.
Figure 4 shows the commonalities across some competing taxonomies and also areas of
divergence. Solutions with more factors can increase the prediction of outcomes including job
performance, income, and change in psychiatric status (Mershon and Gorsuch [1988]). On the
other hand, more parsimonious models in which the five factors are reduced to two “metatraits”
have also been suggested (Digman [1997]). In addition to these controversies, the facet-level
organization of any given Big Five factor is subject to debate and controversy.

Recent research suggests that the rush to accept the Big Five may be premature.143 The
first studies of the Big Five were based primarily on English speaking samples. And, although
the Big Five structure appears to replicate across many cultures (McCrae and Costa [1997b]),
studies of more diverse cultures show that taxonomies known as the Big Six (Ashton, Lee,
Perugini et al. [2004]) or the Multi-Language Seven (ML7; Saucier [2003]), may better represent
the personality domain. While they add one or two dimensions to the Big Five and shift the
meaning of the Big Five slightly, they are, however, not very different from the Big Five.144
One of the most stinging criticisms of the Five-Factor model is that it is atheoretical
(Block [1995]). It is derived from factor analysis of a variety of measures without any firm
biological underpinnings. While research is under way on determining the neural substrates of
the Big Five (see Canli [2006] and DeYoung, Hirsh, Shane et al. [2010]), the finding that
descriptions of behavior as measured by tests, self-reports, and reports of observers cluster
reliably into five groups has not so far been satisfactorily explained by any scientifically
grounded theory.
Some psychologists suggest that the categories are too crude to be useful. Estimates
based on the Big Five factors obscure relationships between specific facets of the Big Five and
outcomes.145 Given that each Big Five factor is a composite of distinct facets, the predictive
validities are diluted when analyses consider only factor-level aggregate scores. For instance,
Paunonen and Ashton [2001] compared Big Five Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience
with two related facets, need for achievement and need for understanding. In each comparison,

the lower-level facet predicted course grades among undergraduates better than its higher-level
factor measure.
The Five-Factor model is largely silent about motivation. In the notation of Section 3, 
parameterizes preferences and goals. The omission of motivation (that is, what people value or
desire) from measures of Big Five traits is not complete, however. The NEO-PI-R, for example,
includes as a facet “achievement striving”. Individual differences in motivation were more
prominent in older (now rarely used) measures of personality. The starting point for Jackson’s
Personality Research Form (PRF; Jackson [1974]), for example, was Murray’s [1938] theory of
basic human drives. Included in the PRF are scales for (need for) play, order, autonomy,
achievement, affiliation, social recognition, and safety. The Schwartz Values Survey (Schwartz
[1992]) is another self-report measure of motivation which yields scores on ten different
motivations including power, achievement, benevolence, and conformity. Some motivation
theorists believe that one’s deepest desires are unconscious and, therefore, may dispute the
practice of measuring motivation using self-report questionnaires (see McClelland, Koestner and
Weinberger [1989]). For a brief review of this debate and an overview of how motivation and
personality trait measures differ, see Roberts, Harms, Smith et al. [2006].
A practical problem facing the analyst who wishes to measure personality is the
multiplicity of personality questionnaires. The proliferation of personality measures reflects, in
part, the more heterogeneous nature of personality in comparison to cognitive ability, although,
as we have seen, various types of cognitive ability have been distinguished in the literature.146
The panoply of measures and constructs also points to the relatively recent and incomplete
convergence of personality psychologists on the Big Five model, as well as the lack of consensus
146

See, for example, Carroll [1993].

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
77
among researchers about identifying and organizing lower-order facets of the Big Five factors
(see DeYoung, Quilty and Peterson [2007] and Hofstee, de Raad and Goldberg [1992]). For
example, some theorists argue that impulsivity is a facet of Neuroticism (Costa and McCrae
[1992b]), others claim that it is a facet of Conscientiousness (Roberts, Chernyshenko, Stark et al.
[2005]), and still others suggest that it is a blend of Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and perhaps
Neuroticism (Revelle [1997]). Figure 4 shows in italics facets of the Big Five whose
classifications are under question. One reason for the proliferation of measures is the variety of
alternative methodologies for verifying tests discussed in Section 4 which are not guaranteed to
produce the same taxonomies.
5.D.1.

Self-Esteem and Locus of Control Are Related to Big Five Emotional Stability

The traits of self-esteem and locus of control deserve special attention since they are collected in
large-sample longitudinal studies used by economists.147 They are not part of the traditional Big
Five typology. However, they can be related to it.
Self-esteem refers to an individual’s subjective estimation of his or her own worth. An
example item from the widely-used Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg [1989]) asks
respondents to indicate their agreement with the statement, “I feel that I am a person of worth, at
least on an equal plane with others.” Locus of control refers to one’s belief about whether the
determinants of one’s life events are largely internal or external. Those with an internal (as
opposed to external) locus of control believe that life events are typically caused by their own
actions. An example item from the widely-used Rotter Locus of Control Scale (Rotter [1966])

147

See, e.g., NLSY79 based studies Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006] and Heckman, Humphries, Urzua et al.
[2010]. The German Socioeconomic Panel (GSOEP) also collects these measures.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
78
requires respondents to choose between “Many of the unhappy things in people’s lives are partly
due to bad luck” and “People’s misfortunes result from the mistakes they make.”
For the most part, researchers who study self-esteem and locus of control have carried out
their work in isolation of each other and without reference to the Big Five taxonomy. However,
Judge and colleagues (Judge, Bono, Erez et al. [2005]; Judge, Erez, Bono et al. [2002]; Judge
and Hurst [2007]) have proposed that locus of control, self-esteem, and Big Five Emotional
Stability are indicators of a common construct, termed core self-evaluations. They point out that
measures of these three traits, as well as generalized self-efficacy (the belief that one can act
effectively to bring about desired results) demonstrate high convergent validity, poor
discriminant validity, and poor incremental predictive validity. Positive core self-evaluations
indicate a generally positive and proactive view of oneself and one’s relationship to the world.
Accordingly, we have, in Table 3, associated aspects of core self-evaluations with the Big Five
factors of Neuroticism and Emotional Stability.
5.D.2.

Relating the Big Five to Measures of Psychopathology

Extreme manifestations of personality traits may be a form of mental illness. Thus, a very
conscientious person may be viewed as an obsessive compulsive person. It is of interest to
consider how psychopathology may be characterized using the Big Five.
Psychopathology is defined by the APA dictionary as “patterns of behavior or thought
processes that are abnormal or maladaptive.” Used interchangeably with the terms mental illness
and mental disorder, psychopathology is primarily studied by psychiatrists and clinical
psychologists. Historically, the study of psychopathology was carried out in near complete
isolation from the study of “normal” variation in personality. Very recently, however, several
attempts have been made to integrate taxonomies of psychopathology and normal personality

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
79
into a single framework. In particular, a compelling argument can be made for conceptualizing of
and measuring mental disorders as extreme variants of personality traits (see Krueger and Eaton
[2010] and ensuing commentary). This approach is quite revolutionary in the study of
psychopathology in at least two ways. First, it takes a dimensional as opposed to categorical
characterization of mental disorders. By a dimensional approach, psychologists mean that traits
lie on an underlying continuum and are not discrete valued. Second, the recent research relies
upon structural validity (e.g., evidence of convergent and discriminant validity) rather than
historical path dependency (e.g., diagnoses that persist because they are familiar to clinicians
who learned about them during their training).
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association
distinguishes between Axis I disorders, which are acute disorders requiring clinical attention
(e.g., depression, schizophrenia) and Axis II disorders148, 10 personality disorders that are more
chronic and, generally, less impairing of overall functioning. Research has documented that Big
Five Neuroticism is a non-specific correlate of various Axis I disorders, and that various other
reliable associations can be documented (e.g., the positive emotionality facet of Extraversion is
associated with bipolar disorder); however, the direction of causality is difficult to ascertain in
what have typically been cross-sectional studies (Bagby, Bindseil, Schuller et al. [1997;
Cloninger, Svrakic, Bayon et al. [1999; Gunderson, Triebwasser, Phillips et al. [1999]). Twin
studies demonstrate that the shared variance in mental disorders and personality traits is
predominantly genetic – that is, common genetic antecedents give rise to certain mental disorders
and personality traits.

148

Axis II also includes mental retardation.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
80
More research has examined relations between Axis II disorders and normal personality
variation. Several authors have proposed a Big Four taxonomy (the Big Five minus Openness to
Experience). Watson, Clark and Chmielewski [2008] proposed that a fifth factor called Oddity is
needed to model traits related to eccentricity. Others have argued that the Big Five structure
itself, without modification, can account for Axis II personality disorders (Widiger and Costa Jr.
[2002]; Widiger, Trull, Clarkin et al. [2002]). For instance, Widiger, Trull, Clarkin et al. [2002]
suggest that all Axis II personality disorders can be “translated as maladaptively extreme variants
of the 30 facets” of the NEO-PI-R, a widely used Big Five personality inventory. More
recently, Samuel and Widiger [2008] completed a meta-analytic review of the relationships
between facets of the NEO-PI-R and Axis II personality disorders which we reproduce in Table
4. Notably, personality disorders relate to multiple facets spanning more than one Big Five
factor.

IQ and Achievement Test Scores Reflect Incentives and Capture Both Cognitive and
Personality Traits

We now elaborate on the discussion of Section 3 on the difficulty of isolating a pure measure of
intelligence. Performance on intelligence and achievement tests depends in part on personality
traits of the test taker, as well as their motivation to perform.149 A smart child unable to sit still
during an exam or uninterested in exerting much effort can produce spuriously low scores on an
IQ test.
It is sometimes claimed that IQ tests measure maximal performance, i.e. that IQ scores
reflect the application of the maximal capacity of the person to the test.150 The analysis of
Section 3 suggests that IQ scores should be standardized for effort. A series of studies conducted
over the past 40 years support this concern.
These studies show that among individuals with low IQ scores, performance on IQ tests
could be increased up to a full standard deviation by offering incentives such as money or candy,
particularly on group-administered tests and particularly with individuals at the low-end of the
IQ spectrum.151 Engaging in complex thinking is effortful, not automatic (Schmeichel, Vohs and
Baumeister [2003]), and therefore motivation to exert effort affects performance. Zigler and
Butterfield [1968] found that early intervention (nursery school, for example) for low-SES kids
may have a beneficial effect on motivation, not on cognitive ability per se. In their study, the
benefits of intervention (in comparison to a no-treatment control group) on IQ were not apparent
under testing conditions where motivation to perform well was maximal. Raver and Zigler

149

It is likely that performance on personality tests can also depend on cognitive ability, but that is less well
documented. For example, it is likely that more intelligent people can ascertain the rewards to performance on a
personality inventory test. Motivation is sometimes, but not usually, counted as a personality trait.
150
A leading psychometrician, Carroll [1993], does not accept the notion that IQ captures maximal effort.
151
The incentives for invoking effort vary across studies.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
83
[1997] present further evidence on this point. Table 5 summarizes evidence that extrinsic
incentives can substantially improve performance on tests of cognitive ability, especially among
low-IQ individuals.152

152

The studies do not include direct measures of personality traits.

Summary

“…a carefully chosen
consequence, candy, given
contingent on each occurrence
of correct responses to an IQ
test, can result in a
significantly higher IQ
score.”(p. 319)
“…test scores often reflect
poor academic skills, but they
may also reflect lack of
motivation to do well in the
criterion test…These results,
obtained from both a
population typically limited in
skills and ability as well as
from a group of normal
children (Experiment II),
demonstrate that the use of
reinforcement procedures
applied to a behavior that is
tacitly regarded as “at its
peak” can significantly alter
the level of performance of
that behavior.” (p. 483)

“…contingent candy increased
the I.Q. scores of only the
‘low I.Q.’ children. This result
suggests that the high and
medium I.Q. groups were
already functioning at a higher
motivational level than
children in the low I.Q.
group.” (p. 22)

Summary

“…performance on an

“…the significant difference
in improvement in standard
IQ performance found
between the nursery and
non-nursery groups was
attributable solely to
motivational factors…” (p.
10)
“In summary, the promise
of individualized incentives
contingent on an increase in
IQ test performance (as
compared with pretest
performance) resulted in an
approximate 17-point
increase in IQ test scores.
These increases were
equally spread across
subtests… The incentive
condition effects were much
less pronounced for students
having pretest IQs between
98 and 120 and did not
occur for students having
pretest IQs between 121 and

(p. 83)
2 reasons why incentive
did not produce dramatic
increase: 1) few or no
unmotivated subjects
among college volunteers,
2) information processing
tasks are too simple for
‘trying harder’ to matter
The increase in IQ scores
could be attributed to any
combination of the
following 1) an increase in
“g” due to schooling at an
intensive charter school, 2)
an increase in knowledge
or crystallized intelligence,
3) an increase in
motivation due to the
change in IQ test format,
and/or 4) an increase in
motivation due to
experience at high
performing school

Segal [2008] shows that introducing performance-based cash incentives in a low-stakes
administration of the coding speed test of the Armed Services Vocational Battery (ASVAB)
increases performance substantially among roughly one-third of participants. Men with lower
levels of Conscientiousness are particularly affected by incentives. Segal’s work and a large
body of related work emphasize heterogeneity in the motivations that affect human performance.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
87
Borghans, Meijers and ter Weel [2008] show that adults spend substantially more time answering
IQ questions when rewards are higher, but subjects high in Emotional Stability and
Conscientiousness are less affected by these incentives. They already operate at a high level
even without these incentives. Similarly, Pailing and Segalowitz [2004] find that an eventrelated potential (ERP) indexing the emotional response to making an error increases in
amplitude when incentives are offered for superior test performance. 153 This effect is smaller for
individuals high in Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability. Thus, IQ scores do not accurately
reflect maximal intellectual performance for individuals who are low in Conscientiousness and
Emotional Stability. Performance on IQ tests encodes, in part, how effective persons may be in
application of their intelligence, that is, how people are likely to perform in a real-world setting.
However, it is far from obvious that motivation on an exam and motivation in a real-world
situation are the same.
Like low motivation, test anxiety can significantly impair performance (Hembree
[1988]). That is, subjects do worse when they worry excessively about how they are performing
and when their autonomic nervous system over-reacts by increasing perspiration, heart rate, and
so on. Because individuals who are higher in Big Five Neuroticism are more likely to experience
test anxiety, there is another reason, beyond incentives, why Emotional Stability can impact IQ
scores (Moutafi, Furnham and Tsaousis [2006]).
Many IQ tests require factual knowledge acquired through schooling and life experience,
which are, in part, determined by the motivation, curiosity, and persistence of the test taker.
Thus, personality traits can also affect IQ scores indirectly through the knowledge acquired by
individuals who are higher in Big Five Openness to Experience and Big Five Conscientiousness.
153

An ERP is an electrophysiological response of characteristic form and timing to a particular category of stimuli.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
88
Cunha and Heckman [2008] show a correlation between cognitive and personality factors of the
order of r  0.3 . Hansen, Heckman and Mullen [2004], and Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua
[2006] show how schooling and other acquired traits substantially causally affect measured
cognitive and personality test scores. We discuss this research in Section 8. Cattell’s investment
theory [1971] anticipates recent findings that knowledge and specific complex skills depend not
only on fluid intelligence but also on the cumulative investment of effort and exposure to
learning opportunities.
How, then, should one interpret a low IQ score? Collectively, the evidence surveyed here
suggests that IQ test performance reflects not only pure intelligence, but also personality traits
(including anxiety), intrinsic motivation, and reactions to extrinsic incentives to perform well, as
indicated in our discussion of Section 3. It also reflects the knowledge acquired up to the date of
the test, which reflects personality and motivational traits that affect the acquisition of
knowledge. The relative impurity of IQ tests likely varies from test to test and individual to
individual. Little effort to date has been made to standardize the context and incentives of tests.
To capture pure intelligence, it is necessary to adjust for incentives, motivations, and context in
which the measurements are taken, using the framework discussed in Section 3.
Just as personality traits and incentives can affect IQ scores, they can also affect
standardized achievement tests that are commonly used as proxies for pure intelligence. Figure 5
and Figure 6, below, show how scores on two achievement tests, the Armed Forces Qualifying
Test (AFQT) and the Differential Aptitudes Test (DAT), are decomposed into IQ and personality
measures.154 We adjust by Rotter and Rosenberg in Figure 5 and by the Big Five in Figure 6.155

154

AFQT and DAT scores are highly correlated ( r  0.76 ). See Borghans, Golsteyn, Heckman et al. [2010],
Kilburn, Hanser and Klerman [1998], Sticht [1995], and Wang [1993].
155
The Big Five are not available in the NLSY79 data that have AFQT scores.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
89
A substantial portion of the variance in both the AFQT score and DAT scores is explained by
personality factors.156 The variance explained is less than the variance independently explained
by IQ scores, but it is still substantial. Furthermore, the facets are incrementally valid in that
they explain the variance above and beyond the variance that IQ explains when all three are
included in a regression. These findings caution the interpretation that these commonly used tests
proxy mental ability. They likely proxy aspects of personality as well. Ironically, the measure
of intelligence used by Herrnstein and Murray in The Bell Curve to predict a variety of social and
economic outcomes is substantially affected by personality measures. We discuss evidence
about personality and standardized achievement tests further in Section 7.

156

The lower explained variance in the sample with DAT is likely a consequence of restriction on range. The DAT
data come from a single school, whereas the AFQT data come from a national sample.

The Evidence on the Situational Specificity Hypothesis

Since the publication of Mischel’s [1968] book, psychologists have addressed the situational
specificity hypothesis, i.e. the hypothesis that situations help explain variations across people in
actions, effort and behavior.157 Boiled down to its essence, this hypothesis says little more than
that situations affect actions and efforts in a nonlinear fashion, i.e., that in equations (13)-(15),
situational variables enter in a nonlinear fashion. This interaction effect gives rise to the
Mischel-Shoda [1995] “if-then” relationship.
An important paper by Epstein [1979] defines stability of personality generated by traits
across situations using measurements that average across tasks. He notes that in the presence of
nonlinearities, agents with the same traits will take different actions in different situations. In
four different studies, he presents compelling empirical evidence that, averaging over tasks and
situations at a point in time, persons act in a predictable fashion with a high level of reliability
( R2 of 0.6-0.8) of average behavior (“measured personality”) across situations. He uses a
variety of measures based on objective behavior, self ratings, and ratings by others. He also
establishes consistency (high levels of correlation) across the different types of measures. In any
given situation, personality may not play a particularly powerful role but averaging over many
situations, stable patterns emerge. Fleeson [2001] and Moskowitz [1982] present additional
evidence on this question. Fleeson and Noftle [2008] summarize a substantial body of evidence
on the stability of behaviors across tasks and situations, and the evidence of consistency of
different measurements of personality (e.g., self reports, observer reports).
In one of the most ambitious recent studies of this question, Borkenau, Mauer, Riemann
et al. [2004] establish a correlation of 0.43 of personality traits measured by the Big Five (self

rated and observer rated) across 15 very different tasks. The range of correlations is from 0.29 to
0.51.158 Wood and Roberts [2006] present further evidence on the persistence of traits across a
variety of situations. Roberts [2009] provides a valuable overview of the latest research. Funder
[2008] provides another useful overview of the debate and the evidence on the existence of a
stable personality trait that at a point in time predicts behavior in a variety of different situations.
Mischel’s [1968] claim that there is no stable personality trait across situations does not hold up
against a large array of data.
A recent summary of the evidence on the person-situation debate is provided in a series
of papers in the Journal of Research in Personality [January, 2009, Vol. 43] that offer a
retrospective on the controversy. Virtually all papers in that special issue acknowledge the
existence of stable personality traits whose manifestations are tempered by situations and
incentives. The editors summarize the main message of the collected papers with the following
words:
“All personality psychologists should be unified when it comes to asserting that

personality differences are worthy of scientific study, that individual differences
are more than just error variance and that not all behavior is simply a function of
the situation” – Lucas and Donnellan [2009, p. 147]

158

Achenbach, McConaughy and Howell [1987] summarize correlations between children’s problem behavior
ratings by parents and teachers. Their meta-analysis produces an estimate of r  0.28 and suggests consistency and
variation in behavior and assessment across home and school situations. Whether this arises from parental bias or
from situational specificity is not clear.

Personality and Preference Parameters

Measures of personality predict a wide range of life outcomes that economists study. However,
with our current knowledge, it is difficult to relate them to economic preference parameters
except, of course, when the traits are the parameters. Since personality psychologists define
traits as “relatively” stable, person-specific determinants of behavior, preferences are the natural
counterpart of these traits in economics. Preferences are unaffected by changes in constraints.
While personality might relate to preferences, the exact link is unclear. Do preferences generate
measured personality? Does personality generate preferences? Or are both generated from other,
deeper, parameters that are as yet unknown? The model in Section 3 links preferences to
measured personality. This section reviews the empirical evidence linking preferences and
personality and discusses the conceptual differences between the two.
Overall, the links between measures of personality and preferences are largely
unexplored. However, some evidence suggests that social preferences can be linked to the Big
Five. The link between traditional preferences, such as risk aversion and time discounting, and
personality, remain largely unknown. Personality measures might allow economists to broaden
the dimensions of preferences and could potentially resolve some apparent inconsistencies in
observed choices that arise from commonly used preference specifications in economics.
6.A.

Evidence on Preference Parameters and Corresponding Personality Measures

The features of preferences that receive the most attention in the economics literature—time
discounting, risk aversion, leisure preference, and social preferences159—appear to have
analogues in the literature in psychology. Table 6 presents the definitions of commonly used
preferences, some tasks and survey questions that have been used to measure them, and an

Survey Questions and Experiments used to Elicit Preference
Delay Discounting: A participant is given a series of choices for whether he would
prefer to receive smaller payments sooner versus a larger payments later. The amounts
and times vary across choices. The choices can be over hypothetical payoffs or realstakes payoffs. (see e.g. Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2011])

Overview of Relationship to Personality Measures
Conceptual Relationships: Conscientiousness, SelfControl, Affective Mindfulness, Consideration of Future
Consequences, Elaboration of Consequences, Time
Preference

Marshmallow Task: A participant (usually a child) is given a marshmallow. The
experimenter leaves the room and tells the participant that he will receive a second
marshmallow if he resists consuming the marshmallow until the experimenter returns.
The length of time that the participant waits is a measure of short-term discounting.
(see, e.g. Mischel, Ayduk, Berman et al. [2010])

Empirical Relationships:
Conscientiousness, Self-Control, Affective Mindfulness,
Elaboration of Consequences, Consideration of Future

Example Survey Question: "How patient are you on a scale from 1 to 10?" (see
GSOEP, 2008)
Risk Aversion –
Preference over
different states of the
world

Lottery Choice Task: A participant is given a series of choices between a safe amount
of money and a lottery. The lottery remains the same across choices, whereas the safe
amount varies. The lowest safe amount for which the participant prefers the lottery is a
measure of risk aversion. The choices can be over hypothetical payoffs or real-stakes
payoffs. (see, e.g. Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2011])
Devil's Task (Slovic's Risk Task): A participant sequentially chooses between ten
"switches" or urns associated with hidden payoffs. The participant is told that nine of
the switches are associated with a reward and one of them results in a loss of all
previous winnings. Once a participant chooses a switch, he cannot flip the same switch
again. The participant can elect to stop picking switches at any time. The number of
switches chosen is a measure of risk aversion. (see, e.g Slovic [1966])
Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART): The participant is given a computerized task in
which he is presented with a series of "balloons" that can be inflated by "pumping" the
balloon. The participant receives potential earnings each time he pumps a balloon. At
any point, the participant can stop pumping, realize the potential earnings, and move to
the next balloon. After a threshold number of pumps each balloon "explodes," and the
participant receives nothing. The threshold varies across balloons, and participants are
not told the distribution of thresholds. (see, e.g. Lejuez, Aklin, Zvolensky et al.

Survey Questions and Experiments used to Elicit Preference
Payments for Working: The participant is given a choice to work at different wages.
Their reservation wage is their preference for leisure. The choices can be over
hypothetical payoffs or real-stakes payoffs. (see, e.g. Borghans, Meijers and ter Weel
[2008])

Dictator Game: A "proposer" has the option to transfer part of an endowment to a
"responder." The responder passively receives any transfer. The transfer is used as a
measure of pure altruism. (see, e.g. Fehr and Schmidt [2006])

Trust Game: An "investor" receives an endowment and can decide to transfer some of
it to a "trustee." The amount transferred increases in value. The trustee can then decide
to transfer some back to the investor but has no monetary incentive to do so. The
amount the investor transfers to the trustee is used a measure of trust. (see, e.g. Fehr
and Schmidt [2006])

to a potential "worker." The worker can either reject the proposal so that no one
receives anything or can accept the proposal and choose any amount of effort. The
employer receives a payment proportional to the worker's effort net of the wage. The
workers action is used as a measure of reciprocity. (see, e.g. Fehr and Schmidt [2006])

Since the 1960s, psychologists have used experiments to elicit time preference and risk
preference here, see, e.g., Mischel, Ayduk, Berman et al. [2010] and Slovic [1962]. A recent
example is the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) (Lejuez, Read, Kahler et al. [2002]), a
computer game in which participants make repeated choices between keeping a certain smaller
monetary reward and taking a chance on an incrementally larger reward. In addition to the
experimental measures, it is tempting to try to map preferences to more vaguely defined traits,
but the precise mapping has not yet been made. Still, some speculation is useful. Time
preference likely relates to Conscientiousness, Self-control, and Consideration of Future
Consequences. Risk Aversion is likely related to Openness to Experience and impulsive
sensation seeking, a trait proposed by Zuckerman, Kolin, Price et al. [1964], defined as “the
tendency to seek novel, varied, complex, and intense sensations and experiences and the
willingness to take risks for the sake of such experience.”160
Preferences for leisure may be related to several personality measures. The Big Five
includes an Achievement Striving subscale of Conscientiousness, which describes ambition, the
capacity for hard work, and an inclination toward purposeful behavior. Jackson’s Personality
Research Form [1974] includes an achievement scale measuring the aspiration to accomplish
difficult tasks and to put forth effort to attain excellence, as well as an endurance scale,
measuring willingness to work long hours and perseverance in the face of difficulty, and a play
scale, measuring the inclination to participate in games, sports, and social activities “just for
fun.” Industriousness has been proposed as one of six facets of Conscientiousness (Roberts,
Chernyshenko, Stark et al. [2005]) and is plausibly related to the preference for leisure.

Social preferences also have conceptual analogues in the personality literature. Warmth
and Gregariousness are facets of Extraversion; Trust, Altruism, and Tender-Mindedness are
facets of Agreeableness; and Hostility is a facet of Neuroticism.
Despite this intuitive mapping of preferences to traits, the empirical evidence supporting
such mappings is weak. The few studies investigating empirical links typically report only
simple regressions or correlations without discussing any underlying model. Some use survey
and self-report measures similar to those used by psychologists rather than elicited preferences.
The last column of Table 6 gives an overview of papers investigating the links.
The evidence relating personality to time preferences is mixed. Using data from an
experiment involving college students, Daly, Delaney and Harmon [2009] find that a factor that
loads heavily on self-control, consideration of future consequences, elaboration of consequences,
affective mindfulness, and Conscientiousness, is negatively associated with the discount rate.
Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2010] measure time preferences experimentally, and while time
preference is related to cognition, Openness to Experience is the only Big Five trait that explains
any variation in time preference. Figure 7 reports correlations between experimental measures of
time preference, Big Five factors and measures of cognition. Here only cognitive measures are
correlated with time preference.161

They do not use a measure of Openness to Experience to separate out its influence from that of cognitive ability.

When they separately regress delay acceptance on Neuroticism, Agreeableness,
Extraversion, Conscientiousness , cognitive skill, race, marital status, age, and education, none of
the personality traits are statistically significant at the 10% level. However, when they split
Conscientiousness into an inhibitive side (moral scrupulousness and cautiousness) and a
proactive side (the need for achievement), they find that the inhibitive side is positively
associated with delay acceptance (   0.13, p  0.10) . This result highlights the importance of
examining facets of the Big Five when considering the relationship between preferences and
personality.
Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2010] find that Openness to Experience and
Agreeableness are related to risk aversion. Figure 7 reports correlations between risk aversion,
Big Five and measures of cognition for a sample of Germans. Of the Big Five, Openness to
Experience and Agreeableness are correlated with risk aversion. There is little evidence
connecting risk aversion and sensation seeking, but Eckel and Grossman [2002] include it as a
control in a study of risk aversion and find no statistically significant effect. However, Bibby and
Ferguson [2011] find that sensation seeking is associated with a lottery measure of risk
tolerance.163 They also find that people who are better at processing emotional information and
who are less extraverted are more susceptible to framing effects when making risky decisions.
Borghans, Golsteyn, Heckman et al. [2009] show that risk-aversion is positively associated with
Neuroticism, which contains measures of fear and strong emotional responses to bad outcomes.
They also find that risk aversion is negatively associated with ambition, a trait which may
involve investment in uncertain opportunities. Further, Agreeableness is positively associated
with risk aversion. As shown in Figure 8, Anderson, Burks, DeYoung et al. [2011] find that of
163

Bibby and Ferguson report this as a measure of loss aversion, but it is more akin to a measure of risk tolerance.

the Big Five, only Neuroticism is positively associated with risk aversion but only for lotteries
over gains not losses. In separate a regression controlling for cognitive skill, Neuroticism,
Agreeableness, Extraversion, Conscientiousness , cognitive skill, race, marital status, age, and
education , risk aversion is positively associated with both Neuroticism (   0.15, p  0.01) and
the inhibitive side of Conscientiousness (   0.10, p  0.10) .
The links between social preferences and the Big Five traits are better established. The
links between social preferences and the Big Five traits is better established. Ben-Ner and
Kramer [2011]find that Extraversion is associated with higher giving in a dictator game.
Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2008] use an experimentally validated survey measure of trust
and find that Conscientiousness and Neuroticism are negatively associated with trust, whereas
Agreeableness and Openness to Experiences are positively associated with trust. Agreeableness
and Conscientiousness are associated with more positive reciprocity and less negative
reciprocity, whereas Neuroticism is associated with more negative reciprocity.
In sum, while many measures of personality and preferences seem conceptually related,
the empirical associations are not uniform across studies, and often the measures of preference
are uncorrelated with intuitively similar personality traits. Nevertheless, in several studies
Neuroticism is associated with risk aversion and facets of Conscientiousness are associated with
delay acceptance. Some evidence suggests that considering facets of the Big Five might help
establish a mapping between personality and preferences. However, the empirical links between
preference parameters and personality traits depend on the data used.

6.B.

Mapping Preferences into Personality

Despite some plausible empirical and conceptual links between preferences and traits, a precise
mapping between the measures is not yet available. In Section 3, we argued that measured

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
105
personality is generated by underlying preference parameters and constraints. However, the
preferences measured by economists are often chosen to ensure identification on particular types
of data on choices and may be misspecified. Further, studies documenting relationships between
preferences and traits typically only study correlations without being motivated by an underlying
model. Hence causal claims are, at this stage, largely premature. There are two main reasons for
the disconnection between measures of personality and measures of preferences.
First, economists typically study marginal rates of substitution, measured over relevant
ranges via observed choices. Personality psychologists typically do not study these tradeoffs and
often do not measure choices. Most approaches to measuring preferences in economics, whether
observational or experimental, use some variation of revealed preference given observed choices.
In contrast, psychologists typically use surveys to elicit preferences, information, or "typical"
actions. Some questions elicit how respondents would feel about a given outcome, without
presenting an alternative outcome. While such questions may elicit some (unspecified) feature of
preferences, it is not clear what is being measured. The difference in approach makes it
intrinsically difficult to compare economic and psychological measures.
Second, traditional preference parameters may not span the entire space of human
decisions measured by psychologists. Time, risk, social, and leisure preferences do not capture
the only tradeoffs in life. While time preference, risk aversion, leisure preference, and social
preference have analogues in psychology, many personality psychologists do not perceive selfcontrol and delay of gratification, risk-taking behavior and sensation-seeking, and motivation
and ambition as the most important aspects of human decision making.
Economists typically make strong simplifying assumptions to make their models tractable
and to secure identification. The estimated parameters are used to build models, evaluate policy,

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
106
and create counterfactuals. The most widely used specifications of tradeoffs are through
parameterizations assuming separability, and assume that marginal rates of substitution are
summarized by one or two parameters. Personality psychologists do not have the same incentives
as economists to describe behavior by simple specifications as they are often content to stop with
rich descriptions and do not use their estimated relationships in subsequent policy analyses.
Thus, they allow for a more complex range of behaviors. The choice of measured traits is large
and often defies a simple, tractable, explanation. As discussed in the previous sections, to
economists these often appear to be arbitrary.
6.C.

Do Measured Parameters Predict Real World Behavior?

One test of the stability of measured preferences is whether they predict behavior in other
contexts. Several recent studies have investigated whether risk preference predict behavior. For
example, Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2011], use an experimentally validated measure of risk
preference in the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) and find that it predicts self-reported
risky behaviors, such as holding stocks, being self-employed, participating in sports, and
smoking, but it does not predict as well as a survey question about ‘willingness to take risks in
general.’ However, the observed relationship might arise because both the self-reported
behaviors and questions about willingness to take risk are noisy contemporaneous survey
measures. Barsky, Juster, Kimball et al. [1997] measure risk tolerance, time preference, and the
intertemporal elasticity of substitution and find that risk tolerance predicts smoking and drinking,
holding insurance and stock, and decisions to immigrate and be self-employed. However,
measures of risk tolerance only explain a small fraction of the variation in risky behaviors.
Benz and Meier [2008] compare measures of social preferences with charitable giving in
a field experiment and find that experimental measures do not predict real life behavior well.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
107
Levitt and List [2007] and List [2009] discuss the more general discrepancy between results from
the lab and the field and argue that this is not necessarily because people behave inconsistently,
but because experimenters are not controlling for relevant aspects of the choice situation. This is
just a rehash of the old person-situation debate. Falk and Heckman [2009] present a different
interpretation of the value of experiments. We discuss the evidence below.
6.D.

Integrating Traits into Economic Models

Behavioral economics has incorporated some aspects of personality psychology to investigate
how standard models of preferences can be improved to better reflect reality. Behavioral
economics has highlighted many so-called anomalies, ways in which standard preferences do not
accurately describe human behavior. We can divide these attempts into two main approaches.
First, behavioral economists have tried to improve models of behavior by developing
more flexible functional forms for preferences. Below we discuss some of the now standard
examples, such as loss aversion, hyperbolic discounting, and reciprocity. These are not
anomalies with respect to rationality, but are examples that challenge standard models of
preferences. For example, the time inconsistent actions induced by hyperbolic discounting
(defined below), are often described as "errors", but they are not. The agent is simply optimizing
non-standard preferences.
Second, behavioral economists have introduced the concept of bounded rationality. These
are behaviors for which there is no reasonable preference specification that can rationalize a
behavior. They are called anomalies or biases relative to conventional economic choice
frameworks. Examples include failure to predict the winner's curse, mental accounting, framing
effects, failure to apply Bayesian updating, and default effects. We think of these as mental
constraints, or traits, along the lines of the models discussed in Section 3. However, these

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
108
examples are consistent with evidence reviewed below on the interaction between cognitive
ability and preference parameters.
Note that while some of the nonstandard features of preferences may seem compelling,
the higher level of generality tends to make it difficult to identify the parameters in the data
commonly used by economists. See the discussion in Hansen [2005].
6.D.1.

Traits as Constraints

Preference measurements that do not account for all of the constraints that agents face might be
biased. In the model of personality in Section 3, we describe how agents act based on both
preference parameters and productive traits that embody constraints. The marginal rate of
substitution is typically identified through price variation. However, the true price ratio might
also depend partly on the unobserved traits of the individual. Failure to account for the traits that
reflect constraints could lead to bias.
The empirical literature has focused on the interaction between cognition and preference
parameters. Virtually all methods of estimating time preference assume that respondents are
equally numerate, but Peters, Vastfjall, Slovic et al. [2006] show that this assumption is often
untrue. Furthermore, more numerate individuals are less susceptible to framing effects and draw
stronger and more precise affective meaning from numbers and comparisons using numbers. The
confound with numeracy may explain why more intelligent (or educated) individuals often
display lower discount rates when decisions require complex calculations to compare subtly
different delays or reward amounts (for example, de Wit, Flory, Acheson et al. [2007]; Dohmen,
Falk, Huffman et al. [2010]), but it does not shed light on why smarter individuals also have
lower discount rates when choosing between relatively simple cash sums (Funder and Block
[1989]) and between non-cash rewards (such as smaller vs. larger candy bars in Mischel and

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
109
Metzner [1962]).164 A meta-analysis by Shamosh and Gray [2007] of 24 studies in which both IQ
and discount rates were measured shows the two traits are inversely related (r  0.23) . The
complexity entailed by comparing the present and future values of rewards suggests that the
inverse relationship between discount rates and intelligence is not just an artifact of
measurement. One explanation for this could be that cognitive ability is related to the ability to
direct attention. Daly, Delaney and Harmon [2009] find that lower discount rates are associated
with cognitive mindfulness, which includes the ability to control attention. Further, an individual
with poor working memory and low intelligence may not be capable of accurately calculating or
even perceiving the value of a deferred reward. At the least, making such calculations is more
effortful (that is, costly) for individuals of low cognitive ability. If the cost of making
calculations exceeds the expected benefit of such deliberation, the individual may choose by
default the immediate, certain reward. However, it is important to be aware of reverse causality,
since more patient individuals may also invest more in cognitive ability.
Measures of cognitive constraints also relate to measured risk preference. There is an
inverse relationship between cognitive ability and risk aversion, where higher-IQ people have
higher risk tolerance (Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2010]).165 Reference dependence can lead
subjects to be susceptible to framing, because they will perceive two identical lotteries
differentially when one is framed as a loss and the other is framed as a gain. Some evidence
suggests that individuals with higher cognitive ability and education are less risk averse. Burks,
Carpenter, Goette et al. [2009] find that higher IQ individuals are more consistent in their

164

Heckman [1976] shows that more educated people have lower discount rates. More able people are more likely
to attend more years of school.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011

choices between a lottery and fixed sums. They hypothesize that agents with higher cognitive
ability can better translate their preferences into choices between lotteries.
Borghans, Golsteyn, Heckman et al. [2010] find that while risk aversion is related to
personality traits, ambiguity is not. In particular, IQ does not explain how subjects choose
between a risky and an ambiguous urn.
6.D.2.

Traits as Preferences

Some aspects of traits may be more naturally thought of as aspects of preferences than as
constraints. For example, Openness to Experience might relate to a preference for learning, and
Extraversion might reflect a preference for social interactions. The distinction between
preferences and constraints often seems tautological. One way of incorporating personality into
preferences is by modifying functional forms, which fall into two broad and sometimes
overlapping categories. First, some of the domains which are traditionally treated as
fundamentally different, such as risk and time preference, social and risk preference, and leisure
and time preference, may be closely related and generated from a common set of psychological
traits. Second, nonseparabilities could confound measures of tradeoffs. The literature on
addiction presents an interesting class of nonseparable models.166 So does the literature on
exotic preferences in economics.167

Multidimensionality
Marginal rates of substitution are often assumed to be generated by only one or two parameters,
for example the discount factor and the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. This facilitates

111
identification given sparse data, and, if it is a sensible specification of preferences, it gives a
convenient description of behaviour. However, one or two parameters may not describe
behaviour well. Conversely, some of the concepts analyzed separately in the literature may be
governed by the same parameters.
In discussing the concept of time discounting, Frederick, Loewenstein and O'Donoghue
[2002] argue that time preference has three dimensions: impulsivity, the tendency to act
spontaneously and without planning; compulsivity, the tendency to stick with plans; and

inhibition, the ability to override automatic responses to urges or emotions. There may be
multiple interpretations of this assertion.
First, the tradeoff between different time periods might be described by several
parameters. Second, impulsivity, inhibition, and compulsivity might reflect constraints, i.e.,
something that affects shadow prices of consumption in different time periods. Third, the
relevant tradeoff might not be between different time periods but, for example in the case of
impulsivity, might be between various levels of sensation seeking, a behavior which is also
related to risk seeking.
Like time preference, risk preference may depend on multiple parameters. As noted by
Rabin [2000], the simple expected utility framework does not explain risk aversion over small
stakes, since it would imply an implausibly high curvature of the utility function. See Starmer
[2000] for a review of the literature on departures from expected utility. When psychologists
started measuring risk-taking behavior, they were puzzled by the large variance across domains
(see the discussion of situational specificity in Section 2). More recently, Weber [2001] shows
that risk preference varies by domain, and a scale that assesses risk taking in five different
domains shows low correlations across these domains (Weber, Blais and Betz [2002]). One can

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
112
be quite risk-averse when it comes to financial decisions but risk-loving when it comes to health
decisions (Hanoch, Johnson and Wilke [2006]). Weber’s risk-return model of risk taking (Weber
and Milliman [1997]; Weber and Hsee [1998]) finds that low correlations among risk-taking
preference across domains can be explained by domain-specific perceptions of riskiness and
return. Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2011] find that a survey question on willingness to take
risks within a domain predicts self-reported behaviors within each domain. Einav, Finkelstein,
Pascu et al. [2010] also find that there are domain-specific components of risk-taking behavior.
Domain specificity might arise because sensation-seeking, enjoyment of risk per se, is an
important aspect of risk preferences.168
Ambiguity aversion, the disutility from model uncertainty, might help explain some
apparent inconsistencies. Ambiguity aversion is measured as the tradeoff between lower
expected return and higher model uncertainty. Ambiguity aversion explains Ellsberg’s paradox:
people tend to prefer an urn with a 0.5 probability of winning to an urn with an unknown
probability where they are allowed to choose which side to bet on. One version of preferences
over ambiguity is due to Gilboa and Schmeidler [1989]. They specify max-min preferences,
where the agent maximizes an expected utility function which has been minimized with respect

Borghans, Golsteyn, Heckman et al. [2009] measure ambiguity aversion and risk aversion in a
group of Dutch high school students and show that this aspect of choice is distinct from risk
aversion.

Zuckerman [2007] suggests that sensation seeking is related more closely to Big Five Conscientiousness
(inversely), but there is obvious conceptual overlap with excitement seeking, a facet of Big Five Extraversion on the
NEO-PI-R questionnaire, as well as with Big Five Openness to Experience.

There is no consensus on how social preferences govern choices. Social preferences refer
to any explanation for non-selfish behavior, usually as measured in a dictator game where people
have to divide a sum between themselves and another person. Typically, more than 60 percent of
proposers give positive amounts, averaging 20 percent of the sum. A variation of this game is the
classic ultimatum game in which a giver divides a sum between himself and another subject, the
receiver, and the other subject can accept or decline the sum. If he declines, both will lose their
money. Studies typically find that receivers decline if offered less than 20 percent. These results
cannot be explained by pure selfishness. In the dictator game, the giver is willing to forgo his
own consumption in order to increase another person’s consumption, and in the ultimatum game,
the receiver is willing to forgo his own consumption in order to decrease the giver’s consumption
if he pays him too little. Many studies seek to find deeper traits that govern these behaviors, such
as preferences over the utility of oneself compared to others, efficiency, and fairness. The notion
of fairness covers various concepts, including equality and rewards in proportion to talent, effort,
kindness, or intentions. For reviews of this literature, see List [2009], and Camerer and Fehr
[2004].
In the linear, separable model, where each good Xi is the consumption of person i , we
can think of the weights as caring or altruism, the fact that people often care about other people’s
utility or consumption. See Meier [2007] for a review. Fehr and Schmidt [1999] analyze
inequality aversion in which people dislike inequality rather than valuing the consumption or
utility of agents per se.
Caring and altruism have been shown to decrease with social distance. People typically
care more about themselves than about others, and they are less altruistic the less well they know
other people.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
114
The social preference of reciprocity has been studied. Fehr and Gächter [2000], and Falk
and Fischbacher [2006] present evidence on reciprocity and conditional cooperation, in which
agents act in a pro-social or antisocial manner depending on the behavior of others with whom
they interact. People exert positive reciprocity if they tend to reward others for kindness but
negative reciprocity if they tend to punish others for unkindness. More precisely, they are willing
to incur a cost in order to reward or punish others. Falk and Fischbacher [2006] develop a theory
of reciprocity where utility depends on the kindness of others, which is a function not only of the
outcome from the another person’s action, but also of the perceived intentions. Reciprocity then
reflects how much value a person puts on rewarding kindness. Economists could model these
features by letting the person-specific weights on the subutilities depend on social distance and
past actions of others. Reciprocity is often measured using a gift-giving game where the
proposer offers a wage to a responder, who then subsequently chooses a level of effort. However,
List [2009] argues that the importance of fairness preferences may have been overstated in the
literature, that many of the observed results are due to concerns over either reputation or scrutiny
by experimenters. Several studies have shown that observed reciprocity fades over a longer time
frame than the short duration of lab experiments (Gneezy and List [2006], Hennig-Schmidt,
Rockenbach and Sadrieh [2010], Kube, Maréchal and Puppe [2006]). Andreoni’s [1995] warm
glow model of altruism suggests that people do not care about others, but value the act of giving.
Inequality aversion is distinct from caring in the sense that A’s utility may be decreasing
in B’s consumption if it is higher than A’s. (See Fehr and Schmidt [2006] for a review.) Fehr
and Schmidt [1999] suggest the following asymmetric specification for the utility of agent n :

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
115
U n  X 1 ,, X j ,, X n ,, X K   X n   n
 n

1
 max | X j  X n |, 0
K  1 jn
1
 max | X n  X j |, 0 ,
K  1 j n

where the weights satisfy  n   n and 0  n  1. In this case, the MRS changes from 1 to -1 at

X A  X B . People place a higher weight on own consumption compared to others’, but when
asked about the distribution of rewards in games where subjects do not have any interest in the
outcome, preferences vary greatly.
People seem to be more accepting of inequality if they believe that it represents a
difference earned through effort rather than from differences in exogenously given talent. (See
Tausch, Potters and Riedl [2010] for a review.) This finding may be related to the notion of
reciprocity. The distinction may be whether the preference is for people who have earned their
reward for doing something “for me” or something admirable in general.
Some aspects of preferences seem to be multidimensional. However, many preference
parameters are correlated. For example, the social preference of “trust” relates to risk aversion
and reciprocity. Altmann, Dohmen and Wibral [2008] measure trust as the willingness to give
money to an investor in a trust game where he will only be repaid if the investor decides to return
the favor. In this game, one can think of trust as the belief about how own actions affect those of
others. They find that trust and positive reciprocity are positively related. Using the German
Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2008] find that most people
exert positive reciprocity; positive reciprocity and negative reciprocity are only weakly
correlated; and people who are negatively reciprocal are less willing to trust others. In situations
involving trust, it seems natural that trust is closely related to risk and ambiguity aversion, that a
person who is more prone to accept uncertainty is also more likely to trust others. Altmann,

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
116
Dohmen and Wibral [2008] also find that people who are less risk averse are also more willing to
trust. However, they do not measure which beliefs the agents hold.
Care has to be taken in distinguishing trust from risk aversion. We demonstrate below
how additively separable specifications of preferences impose observational equivalence
between risk and social preferences. Kosfeld, Heinrichs, Zak et al. [2005] find that people who
receive oxytocin exhibit more trusting behavior in a real-stakes trust game. Oxytocin, however,
does not make subjects more generous, suggesting that trust is not simply altruism. Additionally,
oxytocin does not affect people's decision over risky outcomes when playing against a computer
rather than a human. Combined, these findings suggest that there is a unique characteristic that
affects willingness to trust, distinct from altruism and risk aversion. Fehr [2009] posits that this
missing element might be “betrayal aversion.” Using survey data from Germany, Fehr [2009]
finds that risk preferences, betrayal aversion, and altruism (as expressed through volunteering)
predict people's self-reported willingness to trust others.

Preference Specifications and Their Consequences
The most restrictive version of the additively separable model suggests that the marginal rate of
substitution between two goods does not depend on the consumption of other goods. Browning,
Hansen and Heckman [1999] present ample evidence against this assumption. Apparent
inconsistencies can arise if nonseparability is ignored. Further, estimates will suffer from
omitted variable bias.169
The additively separable intertemporal model imposes the requirement that the
intertemporal elasticity of substitution is the same as the relative risk aversion parameter.
169

See Section A6.D. in the Web Appendix for a discussion of additive separability and its implications.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
117
However, Barsky, Juster, Kimball et al. [1997] find no evidence that the intertemporal elasticity
of substitution is correlated with risk tolerance. However, the sample on which they measure
these parameters is small. Green and Myerson [2004] argue that risk and time belong to different
underlying psychological processes. As evidence, they point out that the two constructs react
differently to the same effect: for example, an increase in the size of reward generally decreases
the discount on time but increases the discount rate when rewards are probabilistic.170 This is
evidence against the standard intertemporally separable model of risk aversion.
One type of nonseparability is between goods and the state or time period. The additively
separable model allows for this type of dependence, represented by the subscript v on the utility
function. While exponential discounting is still the most common representation of time
preferences, experiments show that people tend to put higher weight on the present than on
future periods than would be predicted by exponential discounting. This is the motive for
hyperbolic discounting. The most often used specification is   ,   -preferences, where  is the
usual discount factor while δ is an additional discounting of all future periods, is





Uv X v , X v1,...  u  X v    u  X v1    2u  X v2  .
The consequence of these preferences is that the tradeoff between period v and period v  1 is
not evaluated the same way from the perspective of period v  1 and period v , leading to time
inconsistency.171 Other possibilities are that the discount rates change with age. Hyperbolic and
age-dependent discounting makes use of the subscript v on the utility function. We may think
of an agent in multiple periods as several agents who play a game with each other. The agent
170

Further support for this disassociation comes from a cross-cultural study by Du, Green and Myerson [2002], in
which Chinese graduate students discounted delayed rewards much more steeply than Japanese students, but
Japanese students discounted probabilistic rewards more steeply than did the Chinese. Barsky, Juster, Kimball et al.
[1997] report that their estimates of time preference and risk tolerance are independent.
171
This specification originates in the work of Phelps and Pollak [1968].

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
118
today might account for what future agents might do. Further, discount rates appear to vary
inversely with the size of reward and vary with the type of reward offered.172
As previously noted, the expected utility form for risk preferences does not explain risk
preferences over small stakes, as argued by Rabin [2000]. If subutility functions represent utility
of lifetime wealth in different states, people should be approximately risk neutral for small
stakes. However, people often avoid more than fair small bets. If this is explained by expected
utility, then the curvature of the utility of wealth function would have to be implausibly high.
Kahneman and Tversky [1979] suggest that people are loss averse, i.e., that losses weigh higher
than gains in the utility function. This would imply that people have state-dependent preferences,
which can be expressed as
U n  X 1 , X 2 ,... X n ,... X K    1u  X 1  X n    2u  X 2  X n   ... K u  X K  X n 

where n is the current state, and where u  y  is higher for negative y than for positive y. Note
that this specification is very similar to that of inequality aversion discussed above. Both models
share the feature that people do not have stable preferences over levels, but over differences.
The concepts of loss aversion, reference point dependence, and endowment effects
(Thaler [1980], Kahneman and Tversky [1979]) are variations on this theme. If an agent has had
an object in his possession for even a short amount of time, it affects how he trades it off against
other goods. List [2003] has shown that this effect disappears when agents have market
experience. However, loss aversion will interact with many choices in life, for example, how
agents evaluate lotteries.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
119
Reference point dependence has also been demonstrated in dictator games. In the
standard dictator game, the first player, the “dictator,” is given a positive endowment and can
choose to transfer some of it to a second player at which point the game ends. Numerous studies
have shown that most dictators transfer a positive amount, even though they have no monetary
incentive to do so. List [2007] and Bardsley [2008] modified the standard dictator game by
allowing dictators to take part of the second player’s endowment. With this modification, most
dictators did not transfer positive amounts to the second player.
Experimental measures of social preferences vary greatly across studies. Levitt and List
[2007] and List [2009] argue that the degree of scrutiny in the lab as opposed to in the real world
may make subjects behave more pro-socially (Bandiera, Barankay and Rasul [2005], List [2006])
and argue against the “realism” of experimental data.173 Further, several studies have found that
people tend to be more selfish when the stakes of the game increase (Carpenter, Verhoogen and
Burks [2005], Slonim and Roth [1998], Parco, Rapoport and Stein [2002]).
There is evidence of substantial heterogeneity in preferences both between
socioeconomic groups and within groups. Marginal rates of substitution depend on other factors
such as education, age, cultural values, etc.174 This evidence supports the claim that people are
different at a basic level, since preferences govern the choices that shape life. However,
preferences may be experience dependent. While most studies view life outcomes as the result
of choices governed by exogenous preferences, and hence infer preferences from outcomes,
initial conditions might determine both preferences and constraints on the available choices.
The motivation for preference specifications in economics is typically introspection,
axioms about rationality, and convenience, rather than empirical evidence. When measuring

preferences, functional forms are chosen in an attempt to minimize approximation error subject
to identification. However, economists typically consider preferences over a limited range of
fundamental attributes. Time, risk, and social preferences may not be the right dimensions of
choice over which parameters are stable. Each of these domains seem to be guided by multiple
parameters, and some of these parameters seem to matter for each of the domains. While the
marginal rates of substitution economists measure are correct at observed prices, they may not be
easily mapped into the conventional preference specifications. Personality psychology may help
in guiding economists as where to look for more fundamental parameters. However, the
potential is largely unexplained.

The Predictive Power of Personality Traits

This section discusses the empirical evidence on the power of personality in predicting life
outcomes. A growing body of evidence suggests that personality measures—especially those
related to Conscientiousness, and, to a lesser extent, Neuroticism—predict a wide range of
outcomes. The predictive power of any particular personality measure tends to be less than the
predictive power of IQ but in some cases rivals it.
For three reasons, summarizing the large literature on the predictive power of personality
on outcomes is a daunting task. First, the measures of personality and cognition differ among
studies. As noted in Section 5, not all psychologists use the Big Five. We attempt to cast all
measures into Big Five categories. When this is not possible, we discuss the measures used and
how they relate to the Big Five measures.
Second, different studies use different measures of predictive power. Many studies report
only simple correlations or simple standardized regression coefficients.175 Such estimated
relationships do not control for other factors that may influence outcomes. This is particularly
problematic for estimated relationships between personality measures and other outcomes that do
not control for cognition, situation, or the effect of other personality measures. Where possible,
we report both simple and partial correlations.
We also consider a measure of predictive validity that extends traditional conceptions of
variance explained. Recent work by economists relaxes the normality and linearity assumptions
that underlie the use of simple partial correlations and standardized regression coefficients that
are used in psychology. This method measures the predictive power of variables by the slopes of
175

Standardized regressions produce regression coefficients of outcomes divided by their standard deviations
regressed on explanatory variables divided by their standard deviations. This produces correlation coefficients in
bivariate regressions and partial correlation coefficients in multivariate regressions. See, e.g., Goldberger [1968].

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
126
percentile changes on outcomes and not by variance explained. If outcomes are characterized by
substantial measurement error, a low R 2 for a predictor may still be consistent with a substantial
effect of the predictor on means and quantiles.176
For example, Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006] report the effects of percentile changes
in cognitive and personality measures on a variety of outcomes over the full range of estimated
relationships, relaxing traditional normality or linearity assumptions and not relying directly on
measures of variance explained. This approach to measuring predictive power is increasingly
being applied by economists.177
Third, many studies do not address the question of causality, i.e., does the measured trait
cause (rather than just predict) the outcome? Empirical associations are not a reliable basis for
policy analysis. Problems with reverse causality are rife in personality psychology.
Contemporaneous measures of personality and outcomes are especially problematic. For
example, does greater Neuroticism lower earnings, is it the other way around, or do they
mutually influence each other?
Few economists or psychologists working on the relationship between personality and
outcomes address the issue of causality, and when they do so, it is usually by employing early
measures of cognition and personality to predict later outcomes. As discussed in Section 4,
using early measures of personality traits to predict later outcomes raises problems of its own.
We delineate how each study addresses causality.

176

The slope versus variance explained distinction is an old one. However, the use of slopes as measures of
“importance” is problematic in general because of the arbitrariness in the scales of the dependent and independent
variables. (See Goldberger [1968].) This arbitrariness is resolved in the new measure by mapping quantiles into
quantiles. This literature is nonparametric. The measure is clear in its choice of units but the economic significance
is still questionable. A better measure would relate costs of a change in the independent variable to the benefits.

An Overview of the Main Findings
Before presenting a detailed survey of the effects of personality and cognition on a variety of
outcomes, it is useful to have an overview of the main findings. One principle finding of our
survey, consistent with the claims of the early psychologists cited in Section 2, is that
Conscientiousness is the most predictive Big Five trait across many outcomes. However, other
personality measures predict some outcomes.
Measures of personality predict a range of educational outcomes. Of the Big Five,
Conscientiousness best predicts overall attainment and achievement. Other traits, such as
Openness to Experience, predict finer measures of educational attainment, such as attendance
and course difficulty. Traits related to Neuroticism also affect educational attainment, but the
relationship is not always monotonic. Conscientiousness predicts college grades to the same
degree that SAT scores do. Personality measures predict performance on achievement tests and,
to a lesser degree, performance on intelligence tests.
Personality measures also predict a variety of labor market outcomes. Of the Big Five
traits, Conscientiousness best predicts overall job performance but is less predictive than
measures of intelligence. Conscientiousness, however, predicts performance and wages across a
broad range of occupational categories, whereas the predictive power of measures of intelligence
decreases with job complexity. Additionally, traits related to Neuroticism (e.g. locus of control
and self-esteem) predict a variety of labor market outcomes, including job search effort. Many
traits predict sorting into occupations, consistent with the economic models of comparative
advantage discussed in Section 3. Personality traits are valued differentially across occupations.
All Big Five traits predict some health outcomes. Conscientiousness, however, is the
most predictive and can better predict longevity than does intelligence or background.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
128
Personality measures predict health both through the channel of education and by improving
health-related behavior, such as smoking.
The little evidence on the effect of personality measures on crime suggests that traits
related to Conscientiousness and Agreeableness are important predictors of criminality. These
findings are consistent with the possibility that personality is related to social preferences, as
discussed in Section 6.
Our survey, even though extensive, is not fully comprehensive. We place additional
material in the Web Appendix.

Educational Attainment and Achievement

We now turn to evidence for the predictive power of personality traits for educational outcomes,
separately considering educational attainment, grades, and test scores.

Educational Attainment
Despite recent increases in college attendance, American high school dropout rates remain high.
About one in four American students drops out of formal schooling before receiving a high
school diploma, and in recent decades the dropout rate has increased slightly (Heckman and
LaFontaine [2010]). A growing body of research finds that personality is associated with
educational attainment, suggesting that further study of personality and its determinants might
shed light on the recent stagnation in educational attainment. We begin by reviewing evidence
about the relationship of personality measures with years of schooling and then consider specific
aspects of educational achievement.

Traits such as perseverance and preferences related to an interest in learning might lead
people to attain more total years of schooling. Indeed some evidence suggests that this might be
the case. Table 8 presents associations between years of schooling and the Big Five from three
nationally representative samples. The studies yield different results, possibly because they
control for different covariates or because they come from different countries. The first study
controls for age, sex, and gender and finds that of the Big Five, Openness to Experience and
Conscientiousness are most related to years of schooling attained (Goldberg, Sweeney, Merenda
et al. [1998]) . The second study—which also controls for parental education and father’s
occupational status—reports reports a strong relationship with Openness to Experience but a
much weaker relationship with Conscientiousness than the first study, suggesting that parental
background might mediate some of the effects of Conscientiousness (van Eijck and de Graaf
[2004]).
The first two samples lack information on cognitive ability. Openness to Experience,
however, is the only Big Five factor with moderate associations with general intelligence
( r  0.33 in a meta-analysis by Ackerman and Heggestad [1997]), and intelligence is associated
with years of education ( r  0.55 in Neisser, Boodoo, Bouchard et al. [1996]). Thus Openness
to Experience may proxy for intelligence. However, as Figure 9 illustrates, controlling for
rudimentary measures of crystallized intelligence and fluid intelligence does not affect the
coefficients on the Big Five within the third sample.178 This sample differs from the others,
because Openness to Experience is not strongly associated with years of education unconditional
on intelligence, possibly because it is based on a smaller inventory of questions.
Conscientiousness, however, is associated with years of schooling to a similar degree as

A7 of the Web Appendix presents analogous results for high school graduation.

intelligence. In each study, schooling and personality are measured at the same point in time, so
that for older individuals, personality is measured long after schooling has been completed. This
complicates the interpretation of the estimated effects of schooling on personality in young
samples.

Nevertheless, the components of Openness to Experience representing an intrinsic
interest in ideas and learning may affect educational attainment not measured by total years of
schooling such as the student’s difficulty with classes and attendance. Consistent with this
supposition, a longitudinal study of talented high school students showed that when controlling
for PSAT score, students who expressed more intrinsic motivation in learning took more difficult
math courses one year later (   0.30, p  0.05) , two years later (   0.31, p  0.05) , and three
years later (   0.26, p  0.10) but did not have higher grades in a standardized set of courses.179
Likewise, of the Big Five, Openness to Experience is most consistently associated with fewer
contemporaneously measured school absences in seventh grade ( r  0.31, p  0.01) , tenth
grade ( r  0.19, p  0.01) , and twelfth grade ( r  0.27, p  0.01) (Lounsbury, Steel, Loveland
et al. [2004]). Still, interest in learning is not the whole story. Using prospective data, Lleras
[2008] finds that controlling for cognitive ability, three Conscientious behaviors (completing
homework, working hard, arriving promptly to class) in tenth grade predicted educational
attainment ten years later, whereas relating well to others, a behavior related to Extraversion and
Agreeableness, did not.
Examining discrete educational decisions, rather than total years of education, gives a
more nuanced picture. The decision to obtain a GED is a particularly telling example. Many
view GED certification as equivalent to earning a high school diploma. Indeed GED recipients
have the same distribution of measured achievement test scores as high school graduates who do
not attend college. However, controlling for cognitive ability, GED recipients have lower hourly
wages and annual earnings and attain fewer years of education, suggesting they may “lack the
abilities to think ahead, to persist in tasks, or to adapt to their environments” (Heckman and
179

Wong and Csikszentmihalyi [1991].

Rubinstein [2001, p. 146]). Figure 10, taken from Heckman, Humphries, Urzua et al. [2010],
shows that GED recipients have cognitive skills similar to students who obtain high school
diplomas but do not attend college. However, GED recipients have noncognitive skills
(personality traits) similar to high school dropouts.180

crime, minor crime, marijuana use, regular smoking, drinking, early sexual intercourse, and educational attainment
as laid out in Hansen, Heckman and Mullen [2004]. The sample is restricted to the cross-sectional subsample for
both males and females. Distributions show only those with no post-secondary educational attainment. The
noncognitive ability factors are separately normalized to be mean zero standard deviation one.

Supporting the evidence from the GED program that personality plays an important role
in explaining educational attainment in adolescence, several prospective studies have shown that
facets of Conscientiousness (e.g., self-control, distractibility) and facets of Neuroticism (e.g.,
internal locus of control) predict successful graduation from high school (Bowman and Matthews
[1960; Gough [1964; Hathaway, Reynolds and Monachesi [1969; Janosz, LeBlanc, Boulerice et
al. [1997; Kelly and Veldman [1964; Whisenton and Lorre [1970]).181 Table 9 presents findings
from three more recent studies examining the relationship between locus of control, a trait

181

See Section 5.D for a discussion of the links between these personality facets and the Big Five traits.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
137
related to Emotional Stability, and high school graduation. While the level of statistical
significance varies across studies, the studies report remarkably similar estimates. When
controlling for basic demographics, a one standard deviation increase in locus of control is
associated with a 4.5-6.8 percentage point increase in graduating from high school. Two of the
studies control for cognitive ability and find that the coefficient drops to between 1.4 and 1.5.
However, the measures of cognitive ability (course grades and AFQT score) are partly
determined by locus of control, as discussed later in this section.

Several recent studies using methods that address measurement error and reverse
causality corroborate the evidence that traits related to Neuroticism affect educational attainment.
For example, Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006] account for the effect of family background
on test scores. They correct for the influence of schooling on personality. They address
measurement error in test scores. (Their estimates of the effect of schooling on these traits and
on cognitive measures are discussed in Section 8.) Figure 11 shows that better adolescent
personality traits – as measured by locus of control and self-esteem (traits related to
Neuroticism)—increases the probability of graduating from high school (and stopping at high
school) for males at the lowest quantiles of the personality distribution. However, at higher
quantiles, the probability of stopping education at high school graduation is decreasing in
measured personality, because those students continue on to college. As discussed in Section 3,
the effects of traits on outcomes need not be monotonic. As Figure 12 shows, both higher
cognitive and personality traits have strong effects on graduating from a 4-year college at all
deciles. Moving from the lowest decile to the highest decile in the measured personality
distribution increases the probability of graduating from college more than a similar change in
the cognitive trait distribution. These examples show why considering broad measures of
education might obscure important relationships between skills and educational attainment and
why assuming a linear—or even monotonic—relationship between skills and educational
attainment might be incorrect.182

Cunha, Heckman and Schennach [2010] use a dynamic factor model to investigate the
development of both cognitive skills and personality traits during childhood, allowing for
endogenous investment in skills and dynamic complementarities. They find that adolescent
personality—as measured by a variety of behavior inventories—accounts for 12% of the
variation in educational attainment, whereas adolescent cognitive ability accounts for 16% of the
variation.
A separate, but related literature examines the importance of early attention (a trait
related to Conscientiousness) and aggression (a trait related to low Agreeableness) in

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
142
determining graduation from high school. Some studies find that aggression is particularly
important compared to attention. Duncan and Magnuson [2010a] find that when controlling for
measures of intelligence and demographic variables, antisocial behavior, but not attention
measured in childhood, predicts high school completion where antisocial behavior is negatively
associated with completion. Likewise, Fergusson and Horwood [1998] find that teacher and
parent ratings of conduct problems at age 8 are negatively related to predicted high school
completion at age 18. In contrast, Vitaro, Brendgen, Larose et al. [2005] examine individuals in a
population-based sample of Quebec children and find that kindergarten teacher ratings of
hyperactivity-inattention (inversely) predicted completion of high school better than did
aggressiveness-opposition. Both attention and aggression likely play roles, but there is no
consensus on their relative importance.
In sum, traits related to Big Five Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness are
particularly important in determining how many total years of education individuals complete in
their lifetimes. Two traits related to Neuroticism, locus of control and self-esteem, play a
particularly important role for adolescent schooling decisions. Their effects differ across
schooling attainment levels, suggesting that analysts should be wary of using years of schooling
attained as the outcome variable compared to using the probability of attainment at different
grades. Attention and early aggression, traits related to Conscientiousness and Agreeableness,
are also predictive.

Course Grades
Conscientiousness is the most robust Big Five predictor of course grades, in terms of raw and
partial correlations. Poropat [2009] conducted a meta-analysis of Big Five personality traits and

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
143
course grades in primary, secondary, and post-secondary education, presented in Figure 13.
Associations between grades and Conscientiousness are almost as large as those between grades
and cognitive ability. Associations with grades are substantially smaller for other Big Five
factors, the largest of which is Openness to Experience.

A few prospective, longitudinal studies, have estimated the effect of Conscientiousness
on course grades when controlling for baseline levels of grades. These studies help isolate the
effects of personality on grades by reducing the potential for omitted variable bias and
misleading halo effects – the propensity for teachers to favor students based on traits unrelated to
academic achievement. In general, these studies support the conclusions of studies that do not
account for halo effects. For instance, in a sample of American middle school students, selfcontrol predicts report card grades, controlling for both general intelligence and baseline grades

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
144
(Duckworth and Seligman [2005]). Likewise, Duckworth, Tsukayama and May [2010] use
longitudinal hierarchical linear models to show that changes in self-control predict subsequent
changes in report card grades. In a sample of Chinese primary school children, effortful control
predicted report card grades when controlling for baseline grades (Zhou, Main and Wang
[2010]).
Figure 14 shows that associations between course grades and personality and cognitive
ability and grades are generally stronger in the primary grades, a pattern consistent with
censoring.183 A notable exception to this trend is Conscientiousness, which has the same
association with course grades at all levels.184 If censoring on cognitive and personality traits
attenuates observed associations with course grades among students at higher grade levels,
Conscientiousness might be even more predictive of course grades as students progress through
the education system.185 Consistent with this possibility, in a prospective study of an entire
cohort of Belgium’s medical students, the correlation (corrected for censoring) of
Conscientiousness for GPA increased from r  0.18 in the first year to r  0.45 in the seventh
and final year (Lievens, Dilchert and Ones [2009]).186

183

I.e., that estimated predictive validity diminishes by grade due to censoring.
Censoring was not accounted for in the meta-analysis in Poropat [2009], presumably because norms for variance
in representative samples are generally unavailable for personality measures (Duckworth [2009]).

Overall, the empirical evidence suggests that Conscientiousness may be as predictive as
cognitive ability in predicting and possibly causing higher course grades. Why? Even intelligent
students might not enjoy the work (Wong and Csikszentmihalyi [1991]). Indeed, there is
evidence that the association between Conscientiousness and course grades is mediated by
positive study habits and attitudes, effort, and prosocial behavior in the classroom.187

Standardized Achievement Test Scores
Like course grades, standardized achievement test scores reflect a student’s acquired skills and
knowledge. Thus, dimensions of personality that influence the acquisition of skills and
knowledge should predict both outcomes. One might expect, therefore, that traits related to
Conscientiousness predict achievement test scores. While studies using standardized
187

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
146
achievement tests are less common than studies using grades, ample empirical evidence shows
that aspects of personality predict both metrics of performance. As shown in Section 5, two traits
related to Neuroticism, locus of control and self-esteem, explain much of the variance of the
Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT), an achievement test which is often used as a measure
of pure intelligence in studies in economics. Similarly, Figure 15 shows that in samples from
three New York City middle schools, controlling for IQ, Openness to Experience is associated
with Standardized Achievement Test Scores.

Roy Martin and colleagues were among the first to demonstrate that teacher and parent
ratings of early childhood persistence, (low) distractibility, and (low) activity prospectively
predict both course grades and standardized achievement test scores (see Martin [1989] for a
summary). Likewise, in a representative sample of Baltimore first graders, teacher ratings of

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
147
attention span—restlessness in first grade—predicted both course grades and standardized
achievement test scores four years later (Alexander, Entwisle and Dauber [1993]).
More recently, in a sample of preschool children from low-income homes, parent and
teacher ratings of effortful control, a facet of Conscientiousness, predicted standardized
achievement test scores in kindergarten, even after controlling for general intelligence (Blair and
Razza [2007]). Similarly, in a sample of kindergarteners, teacher and parent ratings of effortful
control predicted performance on standardized achievement tests six months later when
controlling for both verbal intelligence and family socioeconomic status (Valiente, LemeryChalfant and Swanson [2010]). Teacher ratings of inattention at the beginning of the school year
predicted standardized achievement test scores at the end of the school year in a sample of fourth
graders (Finn, Pannozzo and Voelkl [1995]).
Task measures of effortful control, a trait related to Conscientiousness, predict
performance on standardized achievement tests much later in life. For instance, the number of
seconds a child waits for a more preferred treat in a preschool test of delay of gratification
predicts the SAT college admission test more than a decade later, with raw correlations of

r  0.42 for the verbal section and r  0.57 for the quantitative section (Mischel, Shoda and
Rodriguez [1989]). The Head-to-Toes and Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders tasks requires young
children to inhibit automatic responses, pay attention, and keep instructions in working memory
(e.g., to touch their heads when the experimenter says “touch your toes”) (Ponitz, McClelland,
Jewkes et al. [2008]; Ponitz, McClelland, Matthews et al. [2009]). Performance on this brief task
predicts later performance on standardized achievement tests (McClelland, Cameron, Connor et
al. [2007]).

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
148
Perhaps most conclusively, Duncan and colleagues [2007] analyzed six large,
longitudinal datasets and found that school-entry attention skills, measured variously by task and
questionnaire measures, prospectively predict achievement test scores, even when controlling for
school-entry academic skills. In contrast, internalizing behavior (e.g. depression, anxiousness,
withdrawal) and externalizing behaviors (e.g. aggression, hyperactivity, antisocial behavior) at
school-entry do not reliably predict standardized achievement test scores. Attention skills are
related to Conscientiousness; externalizing behavior is related to Agreeableness and
Conscientiousness; and internalizing behaviors are related to Neuroticism.
In sum, traits related to Conscientiousness play an important role in predicting
achievement tests above and beyond cognitive ability. Nevertheless, as discussed in Section 6,
time discounting and risk aversion also relate to test score performance, suggesting that both
personality-related traits and preferences are important determinants of outcomes, consistent
with the economic model presented in Section 3. In contrast to educational attainment, traits
related to Emotional Stability (the opposite of Neuroticism) are less important for test
performance.

Where Course Grades and Standardized Achievement Test Scores Diverge
Course grades and standardized test scores are generally highly correlated. Each form of
assessment provides reciprocal evidence on the validity of the other. Willingham, Pollack and
Lewis [2002] estimate a raw correlation of r  0.62 ( p  0.01) between total grade average and
achievement test scores.188 This strong association—and the objective of each form of
assessment to gauge student learning—explains why standardized achievement tests and grades
188

The correlations were even higher when the test and grades were based on similar subject matter. They use the
data from the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS) data.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
149
are widely assumed to be “mutual surrogates; that is, measuring much the same thing, even in the
face of obvious differences.”189 What are these differences, and how might the contribution of
personality to performance vary accordingly?
Standardized achievement tests are designed to enable apples-to-apples comparisons of
students from diverse contexts. To this end, standardized achievement tests are uniform in
subject matter, format, administration, and grading procedure across all test takers. A course
grade, on the other hand might depend on a particular teacher’s judgment.
The power of standardized achievement tests to predict later academic and occupational
outcomes is well-established (Kuncel and Hezlett [2007]; Sackett, Borneman and Connelly
[2008]; Willingham [1985]). Nevertheless, cumulative high school GPA predicts graduation
from college dramatically better than SAT/ACT scores do, even without adjusting for differences
in high school quality (Bowen, Chingos and McPherson [2009b]). Similarly, high school GPA
more powerfully predicts college rank-in-class (Bowen, Chingos and McPherson [2009b]; Geiser
and Santelices [2007]).
Perhaps more important than which measure of academic achievement – course grades or
standardized achievement test scores – is more predictive of later outcomes is why these
outcomes are related but not entirely interchangeable. Bowen and colleagues [2009b] speculate
that aspects of Conscientiousness seem differentially essential to earning strong course grades
because of what is required of students to earn them. Standardized achievement tests, in contrast
to teacher-designed quizzes, exams, homework assignments, and long-term projects, challenge
students to solve relatively novel problems. It is therefore not surprising that Frey and Detterman
[2004] found a correlation of r  0.82 ( p  0.01) between SAT scores and performance on the
189

ASVAB, an aptitude and achievement test developed for the United States Army. In a separate
sample, Frey and Detterman found a correlation of r  0.72 ( p  0.01) between SAT scores and
IQ when accounting for censoring. In contrast, the correlation between GPA and IQ is r  0.23
( p  0.01) (Poropat [2009]).

In three longitudinal, prospective studies of middle school students, Duckworth, Quinn
and Tsukayama [2010] compare the variance explained in year-end standardized achievement
test scores and GPA by self-control (a facet of Conscientiousness) and fluid intelligence
measured at the beginning of the school year. For example, in a national sample of children,
fourth grade self-control was a stronger predictor of ninth grade GPA (   0.40, p  0.001) than
was fourth grade IQ (   0.28, p  0.001) . In contrast, fourth grade self-control was a weaker
predictor of ninth grade standardized test scores (   0.11, p  0.05) than was fourth grade IQ
(   0.64, p  0.001) . These findings are consistent with those of Willingham, Pollack, and

Lewis [2002], who show that conscientious classroom behaviors are more strongly associated
with GPA than with standardized achievement test scores. Likewise, Oliver, Guerin, and
Gottfried [2007] found that parent and self-report ratings of distractibility and persistence at age
16 predicted high school and college GPA, but not SAT test scores. Table 10 presents results
showing that Conscientiousness and SAT scores are similarly predictive of college GPA.
However, in each of the studies below, Conscientiousness was measured in college which
presents problems for a causal interpretation of this evidence due to the potential for reverse
causality.

In sum, standardized achievement tests and teacher-assigned course grades both reflect
students’ accumulated knowledge and skill. However, they differ in important ways. The
benefits of Conscientiousness, which inclines students to more productive work habits, seem
greater for course grades than for test scores. This finding might explain why girls, who are
higher than boys in Conscientiousness, reliably earn higher grades than boys in every subject

standardized achievement or intelligence tests (Duckworth and Seligman [2006]).

7.B.

Labor Market Outcomes

“Eighty percent of success is showing up.”
 Woody Allen

It is intuitive that personality traits affect labor market outcomes. Showing up is required for
completing a task. Precisely quantifying the direct effects of personality, however, is more
difficult.190 Recently, social scientists have started to tackle the problem and, in general, find
that of the Big Five, Conscientiousness and traits associated with Neuroticism (locus of control
and self-esteem) play a particularly important role in determining job performance and wages.
The evidence suggests multiple channels of influence, including occupational matching,
incentive scheme selection, absenteeism, turnover, and job search.
Aspects of job performance are related to academic performance. For example, both
require completing work on a schedule and involve intelligence to varying degrees. It is
therefore not surprising, that, as with academic performance, numerous studies and metaanalyses have found that Conscientiousness is associated with job performance and wages
(Nyhus and Pons [2005]; Salgado [1997]; Hogan and Holland [2003]; Barrick and Mount
[1991]). Figure 16 presents correlations of the Big Five and IQ with job performance. Of the Big
Five, Conscientiousness is the most associated with job performance but is about half as
predictive as IQ. Conscientiousness, however, may play a more pervasive role than IQ. The
190

Even Allen admits that his estimate is partially based on the fact that “eighty” has better cadence than “seventy”
(Safire [1989]). Bowles, Gintis and Osborne [2001b] discuss evidence on the association between personality traits
and labor market outcomes.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
153
importance of IQ increases with job complexity, defined as the information processing
requirements of the job: cognitive skills are more important for professors, scientists, and senior
managers than for semi-skilled or unskilled laborers (Schmidt and Hunter [2004]). In contrast,
the importance of Conscientiousness does not vary much with job complexity (Barrick and
Mount [1991]), suggesting that it pertains to a wider spectrum of jobs. Causality remains an
open question, as it does in most of the literature in psychology. The raw correlations presented
in Figure 16 do not account for reverse causality, and the authors do not clearly delineate when
the measures of personality were taken.

Correlation

Notes: The values for personality are correlations that were corrected for sampling error, censoring, and
measurement error. Job performance was based on performance ratings, productivity data and training proficiency.
The authors do report the timing of the measurements of personality relative to job performance. Of the Big Five,
the coefficient on Conscientiousness is the only one that is statistically significant with a lower bound on the 90%
credibility value of 0.10. The value for IQ is a raw correlation.
Sources: The correlations reported for personality traits come from a meta-analysis conducted by Barrick and Mount
[1991]. The correlation reported for IQ and job performance come from Schmidt and Hunter [2004].

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
154
Facets related to Emotional Stability (the opposite of Neuroticism) are also important for
labor market success. Accounting for reverse causality, however, is particularly important,
because strong evidence suggests labor market participation can affect traits related to
Neuroticism (See the discussion of the research of Gottschalk [2005] in Section 8). Several
studies have addressed this problem by using measures of personality measured well before
individuals enter the labor market and find that locus of control and self-esteem, two facets of
Emotional Stability, predict wages (Judge and Hurst [2007]; Drago [2008]; Duncan and Dunifon
[1998]). Table 11 presents results from the structural model of Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua
[2006] suggesting that standardized adolescent measures of locus of control and self-esteem
predict adult earnings to a similar degree as cognitive ability. However, the effects vary across
educational levels. In general, noncognitive ability (personality) affects wages to a similar
degree across all education levels, whereas cognitive ability tends to have little effect for GED
recipients, high school dropouts, and college dropouts.

More recent evidence, however, suggests that personality affects wages mostly through
the channel of educational attainment. In Section 7.A, we presented evidence that personality
measures (along with measurements of cognition) are strong predictors of educational
attainment. Heckman, Humphries, Urzua et al. [2010] estimate a model of sequential
educational choice and find that personality, as measured by participation in adolescent risky
behaviors, primarily affects age 30 earnings through its effects on education. They find that
given educational attainment, the effects of personality variables on outcomes are weak.191
Further highlighting the possible role of educational decisions, Figure 17 shows that GED

recipients – who have lower levels of non-cognitive skills but comparable levels of cognitive
skills (see the previous section) – have lower wages, lower total wage income, and work fewer
hours relative to high school graduates, when controlling for ability. Other studies by Heckman,
Stixrud and Urzua [2006] and Cattan [2010], using other measures of personality traits, find that
the traits affect earnings above and beyond their effects on education and the effects of education
on earnings. Resolving these disparate findings is an important topic for future research.

Notes: Regressions control for baseline AFQT scores, age, mother's highest grade completed, and dummies for
urban residence at age 14, southern residence at age 14, and race. Baseline test scores are estimated using the
procedure of Hansen, Heckman and Mullen [2004] as implemented in Carneiro, Heckman and Masterov [2005]. The
regressions use the cross-sectional subsample and minority oversamples of the NLSY79 data. The estimation sample
is restricted to individuals who never attend college and who have not been incarcerated. Regressions for hourly
wage and hours worked are restricted to those reporting more than $1/hour and less than $100/hour, and individuals
working less than 4,000 hours in a given year. Wage income regressions are restricted to individuals reporting wage
incomes between $1,000/year and $100,000/year. All monetary values are in 2005 dollars. Standard errors are
clustered by individual.
Source: Data come from National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) as analyzed by Heckman,
Humphries and Mader [2010].

These various studies have shown that personality is associated with wages, but do not
explain why they are associated other than suggesting that the relationship occurs through the

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
158
channel of educational attainment. Other mechanisms might be absenteeism, job turnover and
unemployment. Indeed, controlling for basic demographics, employment history and health,
Störmer and Fahr [2010] estimate that a standard deviation increase in Emotional Stability and
Agreeableness is associated with 12% ( p  0.01) and 9% ( p  0.05) fewer absent days for men
and a standard deviation increase in Openness to Experience is associated with 13% ( p  0.01)
more absent days for women. However, the study uses contemporaneous measures of
personality and absenteeism.192
Personality plays a role outside of formal employer-employee relationships. Selfemployed workers, with either very low or high levels of risk-aversion, a trait related to
dimensions of personality as discussed in Section 6, tend to remain self-employed for a shorter
time, suggesting that they are less suited to self employment (Caliendo, Fossen and Kritikos
[2008]).193
Personality could directly affect the duration of unemployment spells. Gallo, Endrass,
Bradley et al. [2003] finds that an internal locus of control is associated with a higher probability
of reemployment. A couple of studies have explicitly incorporated locus of control into standard
job search models. For example, Caliendo, Cobb-Clark and Uhlendorff [2010] examine whether
a higher locus of control increases the perceived marginal benefit of exerting search effort, so
that people with a more internal locus of control will search more intensely and will have a
higher reservation wage. Supporting their theory, a one standard deviation increase in internal
locus of control was associated with a 1.9% increase in the reservation wage ( p  0.01) and a
5.3% increase in the number of job applications submitted ( p  0.01) , controlling for
192

All other Big Five traits were not statistically significant at the 10% level.
Caliendo, Fossen, and Kritikos use measures of risk-aversion from 2004 and employment status from 2000-2005,
assuming that risk-aversion is constant during this period.
193

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
159
demographic characteristics and past employment history.194 While the measures were
contemporaneous, the respondents became unemployed near the time that the locus of control
was measured, potentially limiting the role of reverse causality. Similarly, McGee [2010]
proposes a model in which people with a higher locus of control believe that search effort has a
higher return. The theoretical model predicts that those with an internal locus of control search
more intensely but have higher reservation wages, so that the effect on the hazard rate of leaving
unemployment is ambiguous. In line with his predictions, he finds that a one standard deviation
increase in pre-labor market locus of control is associated with a 1.3% increase in the reservation
wage ( p  0.01) and a 20% increase in the time spent searching for a job per week ( p  0.14) .195
Those with moderate levels of locus of control have the highest hazard rates for leaving
unemployment. Consistent with the interpretation that locus of control affects beliefs (not
productivity), locus of control has no effect on reemployment wages when controlling for
reservation wages.
Personality traits also affect occupational choice. From an economic perspective, some
personality traits that reflect ability might be valued more highly in some occupations, and, on
the supply side, people with certain personality traits that relate to preferences might value the
non-pecuniary benefits associated with particular occupations. Supporting this notion,
Conscientiousness (Barrick and Mount [1991]; Ham, Junankar and Wells [2009]), locus of
control and self-esteem (Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006]) predict sorting into occupations.
However, these studies use relatively broad occupational categories that might obfuscate more
nuanced influences of personality. Analyzing eighteen occupational categories, Cobb-Clark and

194

The associations were partially mediated when controlling for the Big Five, suggesting that locus of control
overlaps with the Big Five as suggested in Section 5.
195
The effect on the reservation wage is higher for people looking for first jobs.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
160
Tan [2009] find that for men, a one standard deviation increase in Agreeableness is associated
with a 2.8% decrease in the probability of being a manager ( p  0.01) and a 2.9% decrease in
being a business professional ( p  0.01) . A standard deviation increase in internal locus of
control is associated with 2.8% decrease in the probability of being a manager ( p  0.01) . In
contrast, for women, a one standard deviation increase in Openness to Experience is associated
with a 2.5% increase in being a manager ( p  0.01) .196,197
Furthermore, the value of cognitive ability and personality differs based on occupation
just as they do by education. Cattan [2010] estimates a structural model of comparative
advantage along the lines discussed in Section 3 and finds different skills are valued differently,
depending on the occupation. Accounting for selection, a standard deviation increase in
adolescent sociability (related to Extraversion) leads to a 6% increase in the wages of managers
( p  0.01) , a 4% increase in the wages of sales workers ( p  0.10) , a 2% increase in the wages

of clerical workers ( p  0.05) , but leads to a 2% decrease in wages of professionals ( p  0.10)
and has no significant impact on the wages of blue-collar workers. Self-esteem and locus of
control are positively valued in all occupations, but the magnitudes also depend on the
occupation. The effects of traits need not be uniform on wages across occupations.
Personality might affect not only the occupational selection, but also the type of
compensation scheme selected within occupation. Dur, Non and Roelfsema [2010] extend the
standard principal-agent model by allowing for workers to reciprocate positive attention from
managers by working harder. Their theoretical model implies that promotions, rather than
monetary incentives, should be more effective for eliciting effort from reciprocal workers.
196

The data for occupational categories came from 2001-2006, whereas locus of control was measured in 2003-2004
and The Big Five were measured in 2005. Thus these concerns about reverse causality are valid.
197
They find other statistically significant results at the 5% and 10% levels which we omit for brevity.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
161
Workers self-select into different compensation schemes. Supporting their model, they find that
a one point increase on a seven point reciprocity scale for workers is associated with a 5
percentage point increase of having a job with promotion incentives ( p  0.01) . They use
contemporaneous measures of reciprocity and job attributes, which could be problematic if payfor-performance schemes affect reciprocity. Similarly, Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2009] find
that in a German sample self-reported positive reciprocity is associated with income, and
employment, and working over time. Negative reciprocity tends to work in the opposite
direction. As discussed in Section 6, these measures of social preference relate to personality.198
In sum, there are good theoretical reasons as well as some empirical evidence that
personality affects labor market outcomes through channels other than education.
Conscientiousness and Neuroticism are associated with job performance and wages to a similar
but lesser degree than cognitive ability. The personality traits are more important for people with
lower levels of job complexity or education level, whereas cognitive ability is more important at
higher levels of job complexity. Nevertheless, some research suggests that facets related to
Neuroticism might affect labor outcomes primarily through the channel of educational
attainment. Other traits, such as Openness to Experience and Agreeableness affect more specific
outcomes, such as selection into particular careers or type of compensation. Table A10 in Web
Appendix A7 summarizes a variety of studies that associate personality with labor market
outcomes.

198

Agreeableness and Conscientiousness are associated with more positive reciprocity and less negative reciprocity,
whereas Neuroticism is associated with more negative reciprocity (Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2008]).

Personality and Health199

A link between personality and health has been noted for thousands of years. Hippocrates
argued that an imbalance of the four temperaments would affect both personality and physical
health.200 Consistent with Hippocrates’ ideas, recent evidence suggests that personality predicts
health. The mechanisms are relatively unexplored but some empirical evidence suggests that
personality affects health-related behavior, psychological responses, and social relationships
(Kern and Friedman [2010a]).
A growing body of work shows that personality measures predict longevity. Roberts,
Kuncel, Shiner et al. [2007] review evidence from 34 different studies on the predictive validity
of Big Five personality traits, relative to that of cognitive ability and socioeconomic status, for
longevity. Most studies in their meta-analysis control for relevant background factors, including
gender and severity of disease. Roberts and colleagues convert the results of each study into
correlation coefficients that can be compared across studies. As shown in Figure 18,
Conscientiousness was a stronger predictor of longevity than any other Big Five trait and a
stronger predictor than either IQ or socioeconomic status.201 In general, traits related to
Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, and Agreeableness are associated with longer lives,
whereas those related to Neuroticism are associated with shorter life spans.202 The magnitudes
of the relationships, however, vary across studies and not all results are replicable. While the
specific channels through which personality affects longevity and health are largely unknown,
several studies provide some clues.

studies represented vary from 1 year to 71 years.
Source: Roberts, Kuncel, Shiner et al. [2007]

Personality may affect health-related behavior, such as smoking, diet, and exercise. For
example, Hampson, Goldberg, Vogt et al. [2007] find that high scores of teacher-assessments of
Extraversion, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness during elementary school predict overall
health status during midlife (less smoking, more exercise, better self-rated health) and indirectly
affect health through educational attainment. The correlations that were statistically significant at
the 5% level or less ranged from 0.06 for the effect of Extraversion on physical activity to 0.12
for the effect of Conscientiousness on self-reported health status. Both the initial level and the
growth in hostility (a facet of Neuroticism) throughout elementary school predict cigarette,
alcohol, and marijuana use in high school, and sociability (a trait related to Extraversion) predicts
drinking but not smoking (Hampson, Tildesley, Andrews et al. [2010]). As Figure 19 illustrates,
Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006] find that their personality factor affects the probability of

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
164
daily smoking for males. The gradient is steepest at the high and low quantiles of the
distribution.

and (iii) are evaluated at the mean of the trait not being varied.

Although many studies control for socioeconomic and health factors associated with
mortality, most do not explore how personality affects health throughout the life-cycle (Kern and
Friedman [2010b]). The relationship between health and personality is complicated because

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
165
health can affect personality.203 Some studies investigate the mechanisms by which personality
affects health by considering how initial endowment of traits and health affect mid-life
outcomes, such as healthy behavior and education, which in turn can influence health and
longevity. For example, Gale, Batty and Deary [2008] find that a one standard deviation
increase in age-10 locus of control decreases the risk of adult obesity by 8% ( p  0.05 ).
Similarly, Friedman, Kern and Reynolds [2010] find that in a cohort of gifted children,
Conscientiousness better predicted longevity and social interactions at age 70. They find that
Neuroticism is associated with worse health for women but better health for men. These studies
do not account for the possibility that health and personality exhibit dynamic complementarities
over the life cycle.
Several studies have controlled for reverse-causality by using structural models to
estimate the life-cycle evolution of health. Using a structural model of skill expression, Conti and
Heckman [2010] estimate the causal relationship between personality traits, initial health
endowments and endogenous choices about schooling and post-schooling outcomes. They find
that women sort into higher education based on cognitive ability, personality traits and initial
health endowment. Furthermore, personality and health status measured during youth explain
more than half of the difference in poor health, depression and obesity at age 30. Figure 20
shows that for males, personality and health endowments are more predictive than the cognitive
ones, whereas for females all three are similarly predictive. Using similar methods, Savelyev
[2010] finds that both child Conscientiousness and higher education increase survival through
age 80, but these traits serve as substitutes for each other so that effects of education are only
strong at low levels of Conscientiousness.

Source: Conti and Heckman [2010].

In sum, Conscientiousness seems to be the most important Big Five trait in predicting
health outcomes. Personality likely affects health through behaviors such as smoking, eating, and
exercising. Studies that model the dynamic evolution of health over the life cycle find that
personality affects health outcomes as much as cognitive measures or even more so in some
cases.

Crime204

Few studies have examined the relationship between the Big Five and criminal behavior. The
available evidence suggests that Big Five Conscientiousness and Agreeableness are important
protective factors against criminal activity. Figure 21 illustrates that in a sample of at-risk youth,
boys who had committed severe delinquent behaviors were more than three quarters of a
standard deviation lower in Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, as measured by mother’s
reports at age 12 or 13, than boys who had committed minor or no delinquent behaviors up to
that age (John, Caspi, Robins et al. [1994]).

Figure 21. Juvenile Delinquency and the Big Five

Notes: Delinquents are those who have committed at least one of the following: breaking and entering, strongarming, or selling drugs. Non-delinquents have committed at most one of the following stealing at home, vandalism
at home, or theft of something less than $5. The y-axis reports mean differences in standardized scores of the Big
Five measures based on mother’s reports. The measures were taken at ages 12-13 and reflect cumulative delinquent
behavior.

Much of the literature in criminology focuses on the effects of self-control on crime.
People with low self-control are “impulsive, insensitive, physical (as opposed to mental), risk204

taking, short-sighted, and non-verbal” (Gottfredson and Hirschi [1990], p. 90). Measures of selfcontrol are associated with Big Five Conscientiousness (O’Gorman and Baxter [2002]). Several
studies have confirmed that self-control is associated with criminal activity. In an international
sample, controlling for basic demographics, a measure of self-control explained between 10%
and 16% of the variance in contemporaneously measured theft, assault, drug use, and vandalism
(Vazsonyi, Pickering, Junger et al. [2001]). Self-control relates to controlling impulsive
behavior so it is not surprising that sensation-seeking and impulsivity are also positively
associated with crime. In a sample of college students, partial correlations between a crime
factor205 and sensation-seeking and impulsive behavior were of 0.27 and 0.13 respectively, when
controlling for peer behavior and measures of risk appraisal (Horvath and Zuckerman [1993]).
Self-control might not be the entire story. Negative emotionality—a tendency towards
depression likely related Neuroticism—is associated with contemporaneously measured
delinquency. Raw correlation coefficients range from r  0.13 for whites ( p  0.05) and

r  0.20 for black ( p  0.05) in one sample (Caspi, Moffit, Silva et al. [1994]) to r  0.22
( p  0.01) in another sample (Agnew, Brezina, Wright et al. [2002]). None of these studies

control for cognitive ability nor do they address causality.
Further, an emerging literature investigates causal effects of education on crime.
Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006] estimate a causal model of personality and education
accounting for reverse causality. They find that both cognitive traits and noncognitive traits, as
captured by locus of control and self esteem are affected by schooling.206 These traits in turn are

The crime factor is based on arrest for selling or buying drugs, shoplifting, driving while drunk, perjury, forging
checks, and vandalizing.

equally predictive of criminal activity.207 Using changes in compulsory schooling laws as an
instrument, Lochner and Moretti [2004] and Machin, Marie and Vujić [2010] find that years of
education are negatively associated with criminal activities in the US and UK, respectively. In a
structural model of skill production, Cunha, Heckman and Schennach [2010] show that
personality traits are relatively more important in predicting criminal activity than are cognitive
traits.

207

Their measure of prediction is the effect of decile improvements of cognition and personality traits on the
probability of being in jail.

Stability and Change in Personality Traits and Preferences

In this section, we review empirical evidence that shows that personality and IQ change over the
life cycle. We explore three channels through which personality can change. First, we discuss
the contribution of ontogeny (programmed developmental processes common to all persons) as
well as sociogeny (shared socialization processes) and show how aspects of personality, such as
sensation-seeking, evolve as the brain develops. Second, we show how personality changes
through external forces that operate through alterations in normal biology, such as brain lesions
and chemical interventions. Third, and most relevant for policy, we show that education,
interventions, and parental investment can affect personality throughout the lifecycle. We also
discuss the less abundant evidence on the malleability of preferences.
8.A.

Broad Evidence on Changes in Traits over the Life Cycle

The malleability of personality can be defined and measured in several ways: Mean-level change
refers to change over time in absolute levels of a trait and is measured by changes in measures of
a trait over time. Rank-order change, in contrast, refers to changes in the ordinal ranking of a
trait in a population and is measured by rank correlations among longitudinal measures. One
commonly held view is that rank-order or mean-level change in personality is nearly impossible
after early adulthood. The speculation of James [1890] that “in most of us, by the age of thirty,
the character has set like plaster, and will never soften again” (pp. 125-126) is widely touted (see
Costa and McCrae [1994], McCrae and Costa [1990; 1994; 1996; 2003], Costa, McCrae and
Siegler [1999]). However, mounting evidence suggests that the personality-as-plaster view is not
correct (Roberts, Walton and Viechtbauer [2006], Roberts and Mroczek [2008]).
During the early years of life, mean-level changes in measured traits are obvious and
dramatic. For example, children become much more capable of self-control as they move from

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
171
infancy into toddler and preschool years (McCabe, Cunnington and Brooks-Gunn [2004],
Mischel and Metzner [1962], Posner and Rothbart [2000], Vaughn, Kopp and Krakow [1984]).
But mean-level changes in measured personality are also apparent, albeit less extreme, later in
life. In a 2006 meta-analysis of longitudinal studies, Roberts, Walton and Viechtbauer [2006]
examine cumulative lifetime change in Big Five Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness,
Extraversion, and Agreeableness. They disaggregate Big Five “Extraversion” into social
dominance (assertiveness, dominance) and social vitality (talkativeness, gregariousness, and
sociability). Figure 22 shows that people typically become more socially dominant,
conscientious, and emotionally stable (non-neurotic) across the life cycle, whereas social vitality
and Openness to Experience rise early in life and then fall in old age.208 Surprisingly, after
childhood, the greatest mean-level change in most measured personality traits takes place not
during adolescence, but rather in young adulthood.

208

Figure A3 in Section A9 of the Web Appendix presents results for a variety of cognitive, personality and
preference parameters from a cross-sectional study based on the GSOEP data. Samples are small and standard
errors are large. Many preference parameters show a surprising stability over the life cycle.

In contrast, a longitudinal study of adult intellectual development shows mean-level
declines in cognitive skills, particularly cognitive processing speed, after age 55 or so (Schaie
[1994]). The top panel of Figure 23 shows mean-level changes in cognitive skills using a
longitudinal analysis, and the bottom panel of Figure 23 shows mean-level changes using a

cross-sectional analysis.209 As schematically illustrated in Figure 24, fluid intelligence decreases
and crystallized intelligence rises over the life cycle (Horn [1970]). Accumulated skills and
knowledge are important: most of us would rather use an experienced cardiac surgeon who has
seen hundreds of cases just like ours to perform our surgery, rather than an exceptionally bright
young surgeon with minimal experience.

Cross-sectional estimates of mean-level change are biased by cohort effects (for example, the Flynn effect)
whereas longitudinal estimates are biased by test-retest learning (when the same IQ tests are administered repeatedly
to the same subjects) and by selective attrition. Thus, both estimates must be considered in conjunction as evidence
for mean-level change.

Rank-order stability in measured personality increases steadily over the lifespan. Figure
25 shows that seven-year test-retest stability estimates for personality plateau far from unity, at

r  0.74 , about the same level as terminal stability estimates for IQ (Roberts and DelVecchio
[2000]). However, measured personality does not reach this plateau until at least age 50; whereas
IQ reaches this plateau by age six or eight (Hopkins and Bracht [1975], Schuerger and Witt
[1989]). Figure 26 shows rank order stability of IQ over broad age ranges.

Evidence on Ontogenic and Sociogenic Change

A useful dichotomy contrasts normative change, defined as changes that are caused either by
biological programming (ontogenic) or by predictable changes in social roles (sociogenic), with

non-normative change, encompassing both intentional change, caused by deliberate, self-directed
efforts, deliberately chosen changes in social roles and atypical life events (trauma, for
example).210
If, as McCrae and colleagues have claimed, normative changes reflect genetically
programmed processes then investment should not affect change. The current literature in
psychology claims that genetic factors are largely responsible for stability in personality in
210

Normative here refers to what most people or the average person experiences. If most people deliberately do
something that causes change, it would be normative. But that seems unlikely. Therefore, most deliberative change
is non-normative, but logically this is not necessarily true.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
177
adulthood whereas environmental factors are mostly responsible for change (Blonigen, Hicks,
211,212

Krueger et al. [2006]; Plomin and Nesselroade [1990]).

In a longitudinal study of twins surveyed at age 20 and then again at age 30, about 80
percent of the variance of the stable component of personality was attributed to genetic factors
(McGue, Bacon and Lykken [1993]). In the same study, change in measured personality was
mostly attributed to environmental factors. Helson, Kwan, John et al. [2002], for example,
document the substantial influence that social roles and cultural milieu can have on personality
development. Their analysis is consistent with an economic model of investment and the
response of measured traits to incentives. However, recent evidence suggests that environmental
factors, and in particular stable social roles, also contribute to stability in personality and that
genetic factors can contribute to change (see Roberts, Wood and Caspi [2008] for a review).
Research on IQ also points to the enduring effects of genes, in contrast to more transient
effects of environmental influences, which depend on a multitude of unstable variables,
including social roles, levels of physical maturity and decline, and historical and cultural
milieu.213 Increases in the heritability of IQ from childhood (about 40 percent) to adulthood
(estimates range from 60 percent to 80 percent) are well-documented in studies of behavioral
genetics and possibly reflect increasing control of the individual (vs. parents) over environment
(Bergen, Gardner and Kendler [2007]; McGue, Bouchard, Iacono et al. [1993]; Plomin, DeFries,

211

Plomin and the essays in the December issue of Monographs for the Society for Research in Child Development
(Kovas, Haworth, Philip et al. [2007]) extend this analysis to childhood.
212
We note that there is controversy in the literature about the validity of conventional estimates of heritability. It
centers on the linearity and additivity assumptions, the assumed absence of interactions between genes and
environment, and the assumption that genes do not select environments.
213
We note here that while genes remain constant through the life cycle, the expression of genes is determined, in
part, by experience.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
178
Craig et al. [2002]).214 Heritability estimates for Big Five traits are relatively stable across the
life cycle at about 40 to 60 percent (Bouchard and Loehlin [2001]).215 Behavioral genetics
studies typically estimate the effect of common parental environments on adult measures of
outcomes to be near zero, but Turkheimer, Haley, Waldron et al. [2003] find estimates from such
studies to be biased downward by the over-representation of middle- and upper-class families.
Among poor families, Turkheimer et al. find that 60 percent of the variance in IQ is accounted
for by shared environment and heritability estimates are much smaller than they are for affluent
families, whereas among affluent families, the contribution of heritability is much larger.
Krueger and colleagues have recently demonstrated that other moderators also influence the
heritability of traits (see Krueger, South, Johnson et al. [2008]).216
Genes exert their influence in part through the selection and evocation of environments
that are compatible with one’s genotype—a phenomenon sometimes referred to as “geneenvironment correlation” or “nature via nurture” (see Rutter [2006a]). As individuals move from
childhood to adulthood, they have more control over their environments, and thus geneenvironment correlation becomes more important because shared environments become less
common.217
Substantial but temporary influence of environment is a basic assumption of the DickensFlynn model reconciling the high heritability of IQ and massive gains of IQ between generations

214

Devlin, Daniels and Roeder [1997] suggest that traditional estimates of the heritability of IQ may be inflated
because they fail to take into account the effect of the environment of the maternal womb. See also Rutter [2006b]
and an emerging literature on epigenetics.
215
Lykken [2007] suggests that heritability estimates for personality are substantially higher when situational
influence and measurement error are minimized by taking multiple measures at least a few months apart.
216
It is important to note that shared environment is not the same as environment. Children may be treated
individually by parents.
217
Gene-environment interactions are another means by which genes and environment jointly influence traits. The
effects of the environment depend on the genes and vice versa (see Caspi, Sugden, Moffitt et al. [2003]; Moffitt,
Caspi and Rutter [2005]; and Caspi, McClay, Moffitt et al. [2002]).

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
179
(Dickens and Flynn [2001]).218 The relatively short half-life of common environmental
influences may also explain why adopted children resemble their biological parents more and
more and their adopted parents less and less as they grow older (Scarr, Weinberg and Waldman
[1993]).219
It is important to note that the family studies of genetic influence measure only the effects
of shared environments, which become less similar as children age. Thus even identical twins
may be motivated to seek out different environments over time (Rutter [2006a]). Recent
evidence that first born children grow up, on average, to have three points higher IQ than their
younger siblings reinforces the point that parents do not necessarily provide identical
environments in childhood (Kristensen and Bjerkedal [2007]). Conti, Heckman, Yi et al. [2010]
demonstrate how parents differentially respond to health shocks of identical twins. Lizzeri and
Siniscalchi [2008] develop an economic model of differential parenting of siblings.
As mentioned earlier, genes could affect not only the base level of personality but also
how personality changes over the life cycle. Just as people grow taller throughout childhood,
people’s personalities might naturally develop, even without investment. Steinberg [2008]
speculates that typical biological (ontogenic) development explains the surge of risk-taking in
adolescence followed by the decline in adulthood. Figure 27 illustrates his conjecture about how
basic intellectual ability and psychosocial maturity (related, e.g., to impulsivity, risk perception,

218

A second crucial assumption is that environmental influence can be amplified by a “social multiplier” effect:
smarter individuals create for one another an enriched environment, which in turn increases intelligence, and so on.
Some caution must be taken in relying on the claims in this literature. Blair, Gamson, Thorne et al. [2005] attribute
the Flynn effect to increasing access to formal schooling early in the twentieth century and, from the mid-century
onward, to increasing fluid cognitive demand of mathematics curricula. Flynn [2007] concurs about the former but
believes that the latter had negligible impact.
219
The literature establishes that shared environments become less important as children age. This literature does
not say that environments do not matter. This effect can arise because genetically similar children (or their parents)
choose different environments to distinguish themselves or because of parental investment (Lizzeri and Siniscalchi
[2008]).

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
180
sensation-seeking, future orientation) evolve over the life cycle.220 He argues that intellectual
ability peaks around age 16, whereas psychosocial maturity develops during late adulthood. In
his model, the increase in adolescent risk taking is due to a restructuring of the brain’s
dopaminergic system (responsible for the brain’s reward processing) in such a way that
immediate or novel experiences yield higher rewards, especially in the presence of peers. He
attributes declines in risk-taking due to development of the brain’s cognitive control system,
specifically improvements in the prefrontal cortex which promote aspects of executive function
such as response inhibition, planning ahead, weighing risks and rewards, and the simultaneous
consideration of multiple information sources. Interestingly, even in his model, sensationseeking partly depends on the presence of peers, which corresponds to aspects of the situation
(h ) in the framework of Section 3. This example highlights the difficulty in disentangling

situational and biological changes in personality.

220

Spear [2000a; b] also finds that sensation seeking reaches its peak in adolescence.

What factors other than preprogrammed genetic influences might account for mean-level
changes in personality? Personality change in adulthood may be precipitated by major shifts in
social roles (for example, getting a job for the first time or becoming a parent). If social role
changes are experienced by most people in a population at the same time, we will observe the
effects as mean-level changes in measured personality. If, on the other hand, these social roles
are not assumed synchronously, we will observe rank-order changes.
One difficulty with many of the studies that address this question is the problem of
reverse causality. Changes in personality may drive social role changes rather than the other way
around.

External Changes to Biology

The previous subsection discusses the difficulty in disentangling biological changes in
personality from environmental or situational effects. In this subsection we provide some
evidence on causal changes in personality due to external forces that either damage parts of the
brain or abruptly alter the chemistry of the brain.

Brain Lesion Studies
Brain lesion studies provide the most dramatic and convincing evidence that personality can
change. The most famous example is Phineas Gage, a construction foreman whose head was
impaled by a metal spike and who subsequently changed from being polite and dependable to
rude and unreliable (Damasio, Grabowski, Frank et al. [2005]). Since then, there have been many
more case studies of patients with brain damage. For example, Mataró, Jurado, García-Sánchez
et al. [2001] describe the behavior of a Spanish patient whose head was impaled by an iron spike,
injuring both frontal lobes. Like Phineas Gage, his behavior changed. After the accident, he had
difficulty planning, became more irritable, and had problems regulating emotions. Unlike
Phineas, he was cheerful and did not display anti-social behavior, suggesting the personality is
malleable in different dimensions, even through brain damage.
The effects of brain damage are persistent. After five years, patients who suffered
traumatic head injuries have social impairments, such as anger control, even when their
performance on cognitive tasks returns to the normal range (Lezak [1987]).
Using more advanced methods, neuroscientists have delved deeper into the inner
workings of the brain. Some recent studies have investigated how two parts of the brain, the
amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPC), affect personality by regulating emotion.
Bechara [2005] discusses how emotion might allow people to assign and store value to particular

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
183
outcomes in a way that is useful for decision-making. The amygdala is thought to signal
“impulsive” emotional responses to immediate environmental stimuli, such as reacting quickly to
a snake. In contrast, the VMPC is thought to signal “reflective” emotional responses to
memories and knowledge. These two parts of the brain conflict with each other when people
make decisions: signals from the amygdala induce behavior that implicitly values immediate
outcomes, whereas signals from the VMPC reflect long-run considerations. The stronger signal
dictates the resultant behavior. People with damage to these parts of the brain, exhibit changes in
personality. For example, people with damage to the VMPC, the part that regulates reflective
emotion, tend to act impulsively and seem to overvalue short-term outcomes in a way that leads
to long-term financial loss and loss of friendships, despite having relatively normal levels of
intellectual capacity. These findings are consistent with McClure, Laibson, Loewenstein, and
Cohen’s    system that describes hyperbolic discounting (McClure, Laibson, Loewenstein et
al. [2004]). However, some recent research in neuroscience challenges this theory and presents
empirical evidence that contradicts    theory (Monterosso and Luo [2010]).
Further experiments involving these parts of the brain highlight why attempts to separate
cognitive and noncognitive traits might be futile. For example, Bechara and Damasio [2005]
study the performance of patients with lesions in the VMPC in a seemingly cognitive task. The
participants were given the Iowa Gambling Task, in which they repeatedly chose between four
decks of cards that represented lotteries of different value, unknown to the participant at the
onset. Throughout the experiment, the authors also measured skin conductance responses
(SCRs), a known physiological reflection of emotion. By trial and error, participants without
lesions learned to choose the “better” decks of cards with lower short-term payoffs but higher
average payoffs. The normal participants also showed emotional activity both when picking their

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
184
card and when receiving the rewards or penalties. In contrast, people with lesions never learned
to pick the better decks, seemingly because they could not develop emotional responses. Patients
with damage to the amygdala never showed emotional response to rewards or penalties,
suggesting they never learned to value the outcomes at all. Patients with damage to the VMPC
showed emotional response only when receiving the reward or penalty but not when selecting
decks, suggesting that they might not have reflective emotional responses crucial in considering
future consequences. The findings suggest that emotion helps to guide decision-making.
Numerous other studies show the role of the amygdala in signaling emotions and its relationship
to cognition and behavior (Phelps [2006]).

Chemical and Laboratory Interventions
A few recent studies show that it is possible to alter preferences and personality through
experiments that change the brain’s chemistry. For example, magnetic disruption of the left
lateral prefrontal cortex can increase experimentally elicited discount rates (Figner, Knoch,
Johnson et al. [2010]). Similarly, nasal sprays of oxytocin increase trust (distinct from altruism
or ability to assess probabilities) in a game-theoretic experiment (Kosfeld, Heinrichs, Zak et al.
[2005]). As discussed in Section 5, the Big Five traits are linked to personality disorders.
Therefore, it is not surprising that administering paroxetine, a drug for treating depression,
decreases Neuroticism and increases Extraversion. More surprising is that the drug affects
personality above and beyond its direct effects on depression. Furthermore, patients who become
less neurotic are also less likely to relapse even after treatment, suggesting that paroxetine might
have a long-lasting impact through a bio-chemical change in the brain (Tang, DeRubeis, Hollon
et al. [2009]). Similarly, Knutson, Wolkowitz, Cole et al. [1998] find evidence that paroxetine
can diminish hostile behavior through a decrease in general negative affect.

The Evidence on the Causal Effects of Parental Investment, Education, and
Interventions

Even though brain lesion studies and laboratory experiments provide convincing causal evidence
that personality can be changed, they are not viable mechanisms for large scale policy
interventions. A growing body of evidence suggests that education, parental investment, and
interventions can causally affect personality traits. More than just ontogenic and sociogenic
processes are at work. A major contribution of economics to the literature in psychology is to
develop and apply a framework to investigate how investment, including education, work
experience, and self help, changes traits. We discuss the evidence on trait changes through these
mechanisms, using the theoretical framework introduced in Section 3.H as a guide. In all of the
models considered in this subsection, the development of traits arises from purposive actions of
agents and not just from exogenous biological processes.
The empirical literature has not estimated investment model (16) in Section 3.H in its full
generality. It focuses on estimating productivity functions (1) specified in terms of traits  .
Due to data limitations, there is no empirical work yet to report that standardizes for effort or for
situation. To simplify the notation, we keep h implicit.
Denote the productivity traits at age v by  v . Substituting for actions in terms of their
determinants, the performance on task j at age v is
(22)

Pjv   jv  v , evj  , j  1,, J  , v 

where evj is effort devoted to task j at time v . For simplicity, break  v into cognitive,  , and
personality,  , components:

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
186

 v   v ,v  ,
using the notation of Section 3.221 evj depends on preferences, rewards and information.
The vector of productivity traits evolves via a simplified version of (16):

 v 1   v  v , IN v , hv  , v  1, ,V .

(23)

IN v is interpreted very broadly to include investment by parents, schools, work experience and

interventions.  0 is the vector of initial endowments. Some components of effort may be
included in investment.
The productivity of investment can depend on the age at which it is made. A crucial
feature of the technology that helps to explain many findings in the literature on skill formation
(see Cunha and Heckman [2007; 2009]) is complementarity of traits with investment:
 2 v ( v , IN v , h v )
 0.

Technology (23) is characterized by static complementarity between period v traits and
period v investment. The higher  v , the higher the productivity of the investment. There is also

 

dynamic complementarity if the technology determines period v  1 traits  v1 . This generates
complementarity between investment in period v  1 and investment in period s , s  v  1 .
Higher investment in period v raises  v1 because technology is increasing in IN v , which in
turn raises  s because the technology is increasing in  v , for v between v and s . This, in turn,
increases

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
187
Dynamic complementarity explains the evidence that early nurturing environments affect
the ability of animals and humans to learn. It explains why investments in disadvantaged young
children are so productive. (See Knudsen, Heckman, Cameron et al. [2006].) Early investments
enhance the productivity of later investments. Dynamic complementarity also explains why
investment in low ability adults often has such low returns—because the stock of  v is low.222
Using dynamic complementarity, one can define critical and sensitive periods for investment. If

evidence that shows critical and sensitive periods in human development for a variety of traits.224
Figure 28 shows how adult outcomes are shaped by sequences of investments over the
life cycle. The importance of the early years depends on how easy it is to reverse adverse early
effects with later investment. The literature shows that resilience and remediation are possible,
but are more costly later on.225 The accumulation of investments over the life cycle of the child
determines adult outcomes and the choices people will make when they become adults. To
capture these interactive effects requires nonlinear models.
For the purposes of policy analysis, it is important to know at which stage of the life
cycle interventions are the most effective and to move beyond the correlations between early life
and later life events to understand the mechanisms of skill formation. Cunha and Heckman
[2008] and Cunha, Heckman and Schennach [2010] estimate technologies of skill formation to

understand how the skills of children evolve in response to the stock of skills children have
already accumulated, the investments made by their parents and the stock of skills accumulated
by the parents.

The most general empirical specification of the technology to date is that of Cunha,
Heckman and Schennach [2010]. They allow for Q different developmental stages in the life of
the child: q  {1,  , Q} . Developmental stages may be defined over specific ranges of ages,

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
189
v  {1,  , V } , so Q  V . They assume that each component of  v and IN v can be represented by

a scalar, as can environment hv .226 Letting INkv be investment in trait k at age v , they estimate
a CES, stage-specific, version of (23) for trait k at stage q :

A main finding of Cunha, Heckman and Schennach [2010] is that the elasticity of
substitution  q governing the acquisition of cognitive traits decreases with q . This is consistent
with other evidence that shows the declining malleability of cognition with age, i.e., that
cognitive deficits are easier to remedy at early ages than at later ages. At the same time,  q ,
associated with personality, stays roughly constant over q . This is consistent with evidence on
the emergence of psychological maturity, as shown in Figure 27.227
Adjoined with measurement systems for productivity on tasks in period v (equation
(22)), the econometric model is a “state space” model that accounts for errors in measurements
and endogeneity of inputs. Cunha and Heckman [2008] and Cunha, Heckman and Schennach
[2010] estimate these models on panel data on the growth dynamics of individuals and show that
accounting for measurement error and endogeneity is empirically important.
Cunha, Heckman and Schennach [2010] estimate technology (25) using longitudinal data
on the development of children with rich measures of parental investment and of child traits.
They focus on the substitution parameters to examine the issue of the cost of remediating early
226

For them, environment is parental environment.
Cunha and Heckman [2008] estimate a linear version of the technology. Their specification rules out interaction
and assumes that, over the feasible range, investment can substitute for skill deficits.

disadvantage at later ages. Their findings shed light on the dynamic process of capability
formation in a way that raw correlations do not. They find that self-productivity becomes
stronger as children become older, for both cognitive and noncognitive capability formation. The
elasticity of substitution for cognitive inputs is smaller in second stage production, so that it is
more difficult to compensate for the effects of adverse environments on cognitive endowments at
later ages than it is at earlier ages.
This finding helps to explain the evidence on ineffective cognitive remediation strategies
for disadvantaged adolescents documented in Cunha, Heckman, Lochner et al. [2006], Knudsen,
Heckman, Cameron et al. [2006] and Cunha and Heckman [2007]. Personality traits foster the
development of cognition but not vice versa. It is equally easy to substitute at both stages for
socioemotional skills over the life cycle. Overall, 16% of the variation in educational attainment
is explained by adolescent cognitive traits, 12% is due to adolescent personality (socioemotional
traits), and 15% is due to measured parental investments.
8.D.1.

Evidence of Change in Traits from Other Studies of Parental Investment

Cunha, Heckman, Lochner et al. [2006] summarize a large literature on child development.
Evidence from a substantial literature suggests that for intelligence, the enduring effects of
environment are greater earlier in life. Duyme, Dumaret and Tomkiewicz [1999] studied children
with IQs below 86 who were adopted between the ages of four and six into stable homes. As
measured in their adolescent years, children adopted into high-SES homes gained an average of
19.5 IQ points; children adopted into low-SES homes showed an average gain of 7.7 IQ points.
In studies of Romanian children taken from impoverished orphanages and placed into middleclass British homes, the long-term salutary effects of adoption on cognitive ability were dramatic
when infants were placed before they reached six months, and markedly less so when adoption

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
191
was delayed until later ages (Beckett, Maughan, Rutter et al. [2006]). Notably, children adopted
at different ages between six to 42 months did not differ at age 11 from each other in the terms of
cognitive ability, with all children demonstrating an average deficit of 15 IQ points relative to
children who had been adopted earlier in life. The effects of low nutrition had no effect on
cognitive outcomes at age 11, suggesting a prominent role for psychological deprivation. As
Beckett and colleagues point out, these findings are consistent with the existence of a very early
critical or sensitive period for intellectual development in which particular environmental stimuli
are necessary for normative axonal rewiring (see Uylings [2006] and Rutter [2006b] for
reviews).228
8.D.2.

The Effects of Schooling on Cognitive and Personality Traits

Despite a large literature on the effects of schooling on shaping preferences (see Bowles and
Gintis [1976] and the literature it spawned), there is surprisingly little direct evidence on the
effect of schooling on cognitive and personality traits. An exception is the analysis of Heckman,
Stixrud and Urzua [2006]. The authors formulate and estimate an economic model that identifies
the effect of cognitive and personality traits on schooling and a variety of other outcomes. The
model controls for the effect of schooling in boosting both cognitive and personality measures
and thus controls for reverse causality. They estimate their model on the National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), which has measures on the components of the Armed Services
Vocational Battery (ASVAB) that are used to create the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT),
a widely used measure of cognition. In addition, the NLSY79 has two measures of personality.
The Rotter Locus of Control Scale, discussed in Section 5, is designed to capture the extent to

228

However, the data are also consistent with alternative explanations such as extreme stress permanently damaging
brain structures.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
192
which individuals believe that they have control over their lives through self-motivation or selfdetermination as opposed to the extent that the environment controls their lives (Rotter [1966]).
The NLSY79 data also contain the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, which attempts to assess the
degree of approval or disapproval of one’s self (Rosenberg [1965]). The relationship between
these measures and the Big Five traits of Neuroticism is discussed in Section 5.
Different traits might be more responsive to investment at different ages. Figure 29
shows the causal effects of years of schooling attained on five components of the Armed Forces
Qualifying Test (AFQT). Schooling in the high school years has moderate but positive effects on
the measures of cognition, consistent with previous research by Hansen, Heckman and Mullen
[2004], Neal and Johnson [1996], and Winship and Korenman [1997]. The most dramatic causal
effects on cognition arise from college attendance. In contrast, locus of control is primarily
affected by high school attendance but not college attendance. On measures of self-esteem, an
additional year of high school and college play powerful roles.229

229

See Hansen, Heckman and Mullen [2004] for additional estimates of the causal effect of schooling on AFQT.

Notes: Effect of schooling on socioemotional scales for males with average ability, with 95% confidence bands. The
locus of control scale is based on the four-item abbreviated version of the Rotter Internal-External Locus of Control
Scale. This scale is designed to measure the extent to which individuals believe that they have control over their
lives through self-motivation or self-determination (internal control) as opposed to the extent to which individuals
believe that the environment controls their lives (external control). The self-esteem scale is based on the 10-item
Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. This scale describes a degree of approval or disapproval toward oneself. In both
cases, we standardize the test scores to have within-sample mean zero and variance one, after taking averages over
the respective sets of scales. The model is estimated using the NLSY79 sample. Solid lines depict average test
scores, and dashed lines, 2.5%–97.5% confidence intervals.

Some other evidence supports the possibility that school can affect measures of
intelligence. Cahan and Cohen [1989] use a quasi-experimental paradigm comparing children
who differ in both age and schooling to show that schooling increases intelligence test scores
independently of age. Schooler and colleagues show that complex (that is, cognitively
demanding) work increases intellectual functioning among adults and vice versa (Schooler,
Mulatu and Oates [1999]; Kohn and Schooler [1978]).

8.D.3.

Evidence from Interventions

As noted in the introduction, the Perry Preschool Program, did not have a lasting improvement
on cognitive ability, but did improve important later-life outcomes through personality
(Heckman, Malofeeva, Pinto et al. [2010]). The Perry preschool program enriched the lives of
low-income black children with initial IQs below 85 at age 3. In addition, there were home visits
to promote parent-child interactions. The program stopped after two years. Participants were
taught social skills in a “plan-do-review” sequence where students planned a task, executed it
and then reviewed it with teachers and fellow students. They learned to work with others when
problems arose.230 The program was evaluated by the method of random assignment.
The program had strong effects for both boys and girls, although the effects differ by age
and outcomes. The program had a statistically significant rate of return of around 6-10% per
annum for both boys and girls. These returns are above the post-World War II, pre-2008
meltdown, stock market returns to equity in U.S. labor market that are estimated to be 5.8% per

230

Sylva [1997] describes the Perry program as a Vygotskian program fostering personality traits.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
199
annum.231 The Perry Preschool Program worked primarily through socioemotional channels.
Figure 31 shows that the program improved scores on the California Achievement Test (CAT).
The program, however, did not have a lasting effect on IQ scores. This evidence is consistent
with the discussions in Sections 5 and 7 that show that achievement test results are strongly
dependent on personality traits (Borghans, Duckworth, Heckman et al. [2008]; Borghans,
Golsteyn, Heckman et al. [2009]). Indeed the personalities of participants improved. Participants
had better direct measures of personal behavior (a weighted average of “absences and truancies,”
“lying and cheating,” “stealing,” and “swears or uses obscene words” measured by teachers in
the elementary school years). Participants improved their internalizing behavior, which, as noted
in Section 5, is related to Neuroticism. Heckman, Malofeeva, Pinto et al. [2010] decompose the
treatment effects of the Perry Program into components due to experientially-induced changes of
cognition (IQ) and the measures of personality at their disposal, and to residual factors.
Personality played a more important role in outcomes, particularly in later life.

Analyses of data from Project STAR, a program that randomly assigned kindergarteners
and teachers to classes of different sizes, yields similar results to the Perry Program. Using data
from Project STAR, Dee and West [2008] find that assignment to a small class is associated with
positive changes in personality. In a follow-up reanalysis, Chetty, Friedman, Hilger et al. [2010]
examine the Project STAR program and find that students placed in higher quality kindergarten
classes—as measured by their peer’s average performance on a Stanford Achievement Test—
tend to have higher test scores at the end of kindergarten. The effect fades out over time; by
eighth grade, students in better kindergarten classes perform no differently on tests. However, as
with the Perry Program, the benefits reemerge later in life. People in better kindergarten
classrooms had significantly higher earnings in early adulthood. Furthermore, kindergarten
classroom quality also predicted better fourth and eighth grade behavior as measured by teacher-

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
201
assessed effort, initiative, interest in the class, and disruptive behavior.232 In turn, behavior
predicted earnings in adulthood, suggesting that personality is the channel through which better
kindergarten classrooms improve earnings.
The Perry Program and Project STAR did not primarily focus on improving personality
traits, but a few programs have. The Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies (PATHS)
curriculum teaches self-control, emotional awareness, and social problem-solving skills and is
aimed at elementary school children (see Bierman, Coie, Dodge et al. [2010]). A recent randomassignment, longitudinal study demonstrates that the PATHS curriculum reduces teacher and
peer ratings of aggression, improves teacher and peer ratings of prosocial behavior, and improves
teacher ratings of academic engagement.233 PATHS is an exemplar of school-based social and
emotional learning (SEL) programs, whose impact on both course grades ( d  0.33 ), where d is
measured in units of standard deviations (“effect sizes”), and standardized achievement tests
scores ( d  0.27 ), was recently documented in a meta-analysis of controlled studies involving
over 270,000 children in kindergarten through college (Durlak and Weissberg [in press]).234
Likewise, a random assignment evaluation of Tools of the Mind, a preschool and early primary
school curriculum, shows that in short-term follow-ups it improves classroom behavior as well as
executive function, defined as higher-level cognitive skills including inhibitory control, working
memory, and cognitive flexibility (Barnett, Jung, Yarosz et al. [2008]; Barnett, Yarosz, Thomas
et al. [2006]; Bodrova and Leong [2001]; Bodrova and Leong [2007]; Diamond, Barnett,

232

These scales are based on more detailed questionnaires. Only a subset of the sample has their behavioral
measures.
233
Bierman, Coie, Dodge et al. [2010]
234
Note however that the largest federal study to date on character education programs, including PATHS, failed to
find evidence for improvements in behavior or academic performance (see Social and Character Development
Research Consortium [2010]).

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
202
Thomas et al. [2007]). Similar findings are reported for the Montessori preschool curriculum
(Lillard and Else-Quest [2006]).
There is also evidence that targeted intervention efforts delivered to individual children
can improve aspects of Conscientiousness. These studies are typically more short-term and, in
contrast to the multi-faceted curricula described above, are designed to isolate a particular
mechanism for behavior change. For instance, Rueda and colleagues [2005] designed a set of
computer exercises to train attention in children between four and six years of age. Children in
the intervention group improved in performance on computer tasks of attention relative to
children who instead watched interactive videos for a comparable amount of time. Similarly,
Stevens and colleagues [2008] designed a six-week computerized intervention and showed that it
can improve selective auditory attention (i.e., the ability to attend to a target auditory signal in
the face of an irrelevant, distracting auditory signal). Again, all of these programs have shortterm follow-ups.
Several studies suggest that personality can be remediated in adolescence. Martins [2010]
analyzes data from EPSIS, a program developed to improve student achievement of 13-15 yearolds in Portugal by increasing motivation, self-esteem, and study skills. The program consists of
one-on-one meetings with a trained staff member or meetings in small groups. The intervention
was tailored to each participant’s individual skill deficit. Overall, the program was successful,
cost-effectively decreasing grade retention by 10 percentage points. Bloom, Gardenhire-Crooks
and Mandsager [2009] analyze the data from the National Guard Youth Challenge program, a
17-month intervention for youth who have dropped out of high school. While the program does
not require military enrollment, it stresses aspects of military discipline. The program features a
two-week assessment period, a 20-week residential program often conducted at a military base,

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
203
and a one-year mentoring program. Nine months after entry, participants in the program were
12% more likely to obtain a high school diploma or GED, were 9% more likely to be working
full time, and were less likely to be arrested. Furthermore, participants had higher levels of selfefficacy (a trait related to Emotional Stability), suggesting that personality change might have
helped with the improvements. However, the 9-month follow-up period is too short to know if
the program has long-lasting effects. While these studies show that personality can be improved
through intervention, a couple of other studies show less promising results when the
interventions were targeted at adolescents (Rodríguez-Planas [2010], Holmlund and Silva
[2009]).
Behncke [2009] provides some experimental evidence that short-term exogenous shocks
to non-cognitive skills affect test performance. She finds giving words of encouragement, an
intervention that might boost short-term self-efficacy or self-esteem, before a diagnostic math
test was associated with 2.5% higher scores amongst all students ( p  0.05) and 8% higher
scores amongst those with self-reported difficulties with math ( p  0.01) . The result suggests that
non-cognitive skills can be shaped, even in the very short-term.
The evidence for adults corroborates the finding of Cunha, Heckman and Schennach
[2010] for children. Personality is malleable throughout the life cycle. For example, Gottschalk
[2005] shows evidence from a randomized control trial that working at a job can improve locus
of control. He uses data from the Self-Sufficiency Project (SSP) in which some welfare
recipients were randomly offered substantial subsidies to work. The subsidy more than doubled
the earnings of a minimum wage worker, and people in the experiment group worked about 1/3
more hours than those in the control group. After 36 months, those who received the subsidy
were more likely to have an improved locus of control.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
204
Several other studies find similar results. Clausen and Gilens [1990] claim that female
labor force participation increases self-confidence. Roberts [1997] reports an increase of social
dominance and Roberts and Chapman [2000] a decrease in Neuroticism for working women.
Others show that marital and family experiences shape personality (Helson and Picano [1990],
Roberts, Helson and Klohnen [2002]). However, these studies are all correlational in nature.
None of these studies have the random assignment features of the Gottschalk study.
Personality may even be malleable at the end of life. Jackson, Hill, Payne et al. [2010]
investigate causal mechanisms behind the association between Openness to Experience and IQ,
using data from a 16-week intervention designed to boost inductive reasoning for elderly people.
The intervention consisted of lab training for how to recognize novel patterns and around 10
hours a week of solving crossword, Sudoku, and logic puzzles. Controlling for inductive
reasoning, self-reported Openness to Experience increased for participants during the training
program relative to those in a waitlisted control group. However, the elderly people were not
followed after the program to determine whether the change was long-lasting nor were other
important outcomes, like life expectancy, tracked.
Table 12 summarizes the evidence on the effects of interventions that is discussed in this
subsection. The evidence is consistent with effects of interventions but there are woefully few
causal studies with long term follow-up.

May-June of 2003.

Control Variables: n/a
Timing of Measurements:
Post treatment – The diagnostic test was
given immediately after the treatment.

Control Variables: time, time squared,
individual baseline, school baseline, city
fixed effects, poverty level, interactions
of intervention with time, time squared,
individual baseline, poverty, and poverty
and time
Timing of Measurements:
Baseline – Behavioral measures were
taken prior to the program in the fall of
1st grade.
Post treatment – Behavioral measures
were taken again in the spring of 3rd
grade around the end of the program.

Verbal encouragement raised test scores by
2.5% amongst all students (p<0.05) and by
8.0% amongst students who reported
difficulties with math (p<0.01).

Immediately after the 3-year program,
participation was associated with a 0.24
standard deviation increase in authority
acceptance (p<0.001), a 0.12 standard
deviation increase in cognitive concentration
(p<0.001), and a 0.34 standard deviation
increase in social competence (p<0.0001)
compared to the control group. The effects
were stronger in more disadvantaged schools.
Similar but weaker results apply for the peerassessed measures.

Main Variable(s)
Outcome(s): educational attainment
– high school diploma, labor force
participation – whether working at a
job, personality – self-efficacy and
social adjustment

Intervention: participation in the
ChalleNGe program consisting of a
2-week assessment period, 20-week
residential program often conducted
at a military base, and a 1-year
mentoring program.
Outcome(s): non-cognitive skills –
an index based on the teacher’s
observations of the students
Intervention: randomly assigned
kindergarten class quality as
measured by difference in
percentiles of the mean end-of-year
test scores of the students’
classmates and the scores of the
other kindergarteners at the same
school

Data and Methods
Data: 1,018 young people
between the ages 16 and 18
who have dropped out of
school

Methods: The control group
was constructed out of
applicants who qualified for
the program but were not
taken due to lack of space.
Data: Project STAR; 1,671
4th grade students and 1,780
8th grade students
Methods: Students and
teachers were randomly
assigned in kindergarten to
classrooms of different
sizes. The students were
assigned to the same size
classroom through 3rd grade.

Causal Evidence
Control Variables: sample member
characteristics

Timing of Measurements:
During treatment – Outcomes were
measured approximately 9 months after
entering the study.

Control Variables: wave fixed effects,
student gender, free-lunch status, age,
race, a quartic in the claiming parent's
household income interacted with
parent's marital status, mother's age at
child's birth, whether the parents own a
home, and whether the parents made a
401 (k) contribution between 1996 and
2008
Timing of Measurements:
During treatment – Age-relevant SAT
tests were administered in kindergarten
and grades 1-3.
Post treatment – Age-relevant SAT test
were and behavioral surveys were given
in 4th and 8th grade. College quality and
attendance was at age 19. Earnings were
at age 27.

Main Result(s)
Participants in the program were 12.0
percentage points more likely to earn a high
school diploma (p<0.01), 9.1 percentage
points more likely to be working (p<0.01),
and 9.6 percentage points less likely to report
a self-efficacy and social adjustment score
one standard deviation below the mean
(p<0.01). The program also improved
measures of criminality and health.

A 1 percentile improvement in kindergarten
class quality increases an index of noncognitive skills by 0.15 percentiles in 4th
grade (p<0.05) and 0.13 percentiles in 8th
grade (p<0.05). Better classrooms were also
associated with better life outcomes.

Main Variable(s)
Outcome(s): Executive Function –
Dots-Mixed task, Reverse-Flanker
task

Intervention: participation in a Tools
of the Mind program instead of the
regular school district’s balanced
literacy program
Outcome(s): social and emotional
learning skills, attitudes, positive
social behavior, conduct problems,
emotional distress, academic
performance

Data and Methods
Data: 147 preschoolers

Methods: Teachers and
students were randomly
assigned to classrooms
within the same school.
Data: 270,034 kindergarten
through high school students
Methods: All studies include
a control group.

Causal Evidence
Control Variables: age, gender, years in
program

Timing of Measurements:
Post-treatment – The tasks were given at
the end of the program 2nd year of the
program.
Control Variables: n/a
Timing of Measurements: All studies
contained follow-up data at least 6
months after the intervention.

Intervention: Meta-analysis of
school-based, universal social and
emotional learning program.
Gottschalk
[2005]

Outcome(s): Personality –four
measures of locus of control based
on whether the respondent agrees
strongly, agrees, disagrees, or
strongly disagrees with statements

Data: Self-Sufficiency
Project; 4,958 single parents
over the age of 19 in New
Brunswick and British
Columbia

Intervention: A subsidy for full-time
work during a 36-month period

Methods: The subsidy was
randomly offered to a
population of people
receiving Income Assistance
(IA)

Control Variables: age, age squared,
region, gender, speaks French, number
of children
Timing of Measurements:
Baseline – Locus of control was
measured before the program.
During treatment – Locus of control was
measured again 18 and 36 months after
the baseline.

Main Result(s)
84% of students in Tools were successful in
the Reverse Flanker task compared to 65% in
the control group. Almost twice as many
students in the Tools program achieved
greater than 75% accuracy on the DotsMixed task compared to the control group.

The mean difference in standard deviations
between the treatment and control groups are
as follows: social and emotional learning
skills = 0.57 (p<0.05); attitudes = 0.23
(p<0.05); positive social behavior = 0.24
(p<0.05); conduct problems = 0.22 (p<0.05);
emotional distress = 0.24 (p<0.05); academic
performance = 0.27 (p<0.05). All variables
are coded so that positive numbers reflect
better outcomes.
Using whether the participant received the
subsidy as an instrument for hours worked,
the authors find that working tends to
improve locus of control by the 36 month reinterview.

Main Variable(s)
Outcome(s):externalizing behavior,
internalizing behavior – measured
using Pupil Behavior Inventory
(PBI) of teacher reports

Intervention: participation in the
Perry Preschool Program, an
intervention that lasted 2 years and
enriched the lives of low income
black children
Outcome(s): academic performance
– average of standardized test scores
in English, Math, and Science
Intervention: participation in the “xl
programme” targeting the noncognitive skills of secondary school
students aged 14

Data and Methods
Data: Perry Preschool
Program; 123 preschool
students

Methods: The students were
randomly assigned to
treatment through a complex
procedure.
Data: “xl club programme,”
National Pupil Database
(NPD), Pupil Level Annual
Schools Census (PLASC) ;
2,333 and 259,189 treated
and control students aged 14
in England (2004)
Methods: logit, propensity
score matching, OLS,
difference-in-difference,
double differences, randomgrowth model

Causal Evidence
Control Variables: n/a

Timing of Measurements:
Post treatment – The measure of
externalizing and internalizing behavior
are taken ages 7-9 (2-4 years after
treatment). Other life outcomes were
measured at ages 19, 27, and 40.
Control Variables: sex, language,
eligibility for school meals, special
needs status, and race
Timing of Measurements:
Baseline – Standardized exams were
taken at age 11 and age 14 before the
start of the program.
Post treatment – Standardized national
exams were taken again at age 16 at the
end of the program (2 years after the
beginning of the program).

Main Result(s)
The intervention improved mean
externalizing behavior for both males and
females (p<0.05). It had a borderline
statistically significant impact on
internalizing behavior. The program also
benefited a wide range of later life outcomes
primarily through non-cognitive skills.

Unconditional on observables, the
performance of the students in the xl club is
1.2 to 1.4 standard deviations lower than the
control subjects (p<0.01). Using OLS , the
effect is -0.17. The propensity score
estimates are -0.13 and -0.15. For the
difference-in-difference models estimated
using OLS and propensity score matching,
there is no longer a significant effect of the
program in either direction. Overall the
program had little effect.

altruistic behavior, positive social
behavior, problem behavior, ADHDrelated behavior; Academics –
engagement with learning, academic
competence and motivation;
Perceptions of School Climate –
positive school orientation, negative
school orientation, student afraid at
school, victimization at school,
feelings of safety, student support
for teachers

Intervention: 7 different programs
(ABC, CSP, LBW, PA, PATHS,
4Rs, SS) aimed to build Social and
Character Development (SACD)
compared to the “standard practice”
programs at non-treated schools

Data and Methods
Data: Social and Character
Development (SACD)
Research Program; around
6,000 elementary school
students

Methods: Schools were first
asked to participate in the
program and were then
randomly assigned one of
the 7 SACD programs or left
with their traditional
curriculum. The data were
analyzed using HLM.

Causal Evidence
Control Variables: gender, race, parental
education, family structure, household
income, measures of poverty, parental
labor force participation, teacher race,
teacher experience. (Note: the specific
set depended on the outcome of interest.)

Timing of Measurements:
Baseline – Initial measures were
collected near the start of the program in
the fall of 2004.
During treatment – Data were collected
in the spring of 2005, the fall of 2005,
and the spring of 2006.
Post treatment – Data were collected
near the end of the program in the spring
of 2007.

Main Result(s)
Fall 2003 to Spring 2005: Of the 20
outcomes, the only significant effects were
that participation in any program was
associated with a 0.07 standard deviation
higher primary caregiver-reported altruistic
behavior (p<0.10), a 0.06 standard deviation
lower child-reported altruistic behavior
(p<0.10), and a 0.12 standard deviation
higher teacher-reported student support for
teachers (p<0.05).

Fall 2003 to Spring 2006: Of the 20
outcomes, the only significant effects were
that participation in any program was
associated with a 0.07 standard deviation
lower child-reported self-efficacy for peer
interactions (p<0.10) and 0.16 standard
deviation higher teacher-reported student
support for teachers (p<0.05).
Fall 2003 to Spring 2007: There were no
statistically different effects of participating
in any program.
Other Analyses: The results were similar
when analyzing each of the programs
separately and when using growth curves.
There is some evidence that programs were
beneficial for high-risk students.

Evidence from Psychotherapy
The accomplishments of psychotherapy also support the possibility of intentional, mean-level,
and rank-order change. In a 1980 meta-analysis, Smith, Glass and Miller summarized 475
controlled studies, concluding that individuals who undergo psychotherapy are about 0.85
standard deviations better on outcome measures than those who do not. The large benefits of
therapy are not permanent, however: the effect of psychotherapy over control conditions falls to
about half a standard deviation two years after therapy is concluded. Moreover, it is not clear that
the effects of psychotherapy on individuals who seek change generalize to individuals who are
not actively seeking treatment for a condition that causes them distress.235
More evidence on the possibility of intentional change comes from the psychological
literature on expertise. Ericsson, Krampe and Tesch-Römer [1993] demonstrate across domains
as diverse as chess, musical performance, and digit span memory, that thousands of hours of
sustained, deliberate practice lead to dramatic improvements in skill. Ericsson points out that the
top performers in nearly every field do not reach world-class levels of skill until at least ten years
of deliberate practice.236

8.E.

Stability of Economic Preference Parameters

Less is known about the stability of economic preferences. To our knowledge, no longitudinal
study has measured the mean-level or rank-order stability of time preference over the life cycle
(Frederick, Loewenstein and O'Donoghue [2002]). A handful of cross-sectional studies using
relatively small samples have examined mean-level stability, and their findings are mixed.
235

Some evidence that further intervention can produce enduring change in non-clinical populations comes from
Gillham and Reivich [1999] who show that children taught to make more optimistic causal attributions about
negative events maintain this optimistic outlook two years post-intervention.
236
See Ericsson and Ward [2007] for a recent review of the evidence.

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
213
Green, Fry and Myerson [1994] and Harrison, Lau and Williams [2002] find that discount rates
are lower among older individuals. On the other hand, Chesson and Viscusi [2000] claim to find
that older adults have higher discount rates than younger adults. Chao, Szrek, Sousa Pereira et
al. [2007], de Wit, Flory, Acheson et al. [2007], and Coller and Williams [1999] find no
relationship between age and discount rate. Finally, Read and Read [2004] find a curvilinear
relationship in which older people discount more than younger people, and middle-aged people
discount less than either group. Sahm [2007] shows that risk aversion increases with age. Table
13 below summarizes the findings for a variety of recent economic studies on the heritability,
malleability and stability of preferences and personality.

Summary of Section 8
We have reviewed the evidence on change in personality over the life cycle. The evidence is
strong that personality changes over the life cycle, both in terms of mean-level and rank-order
change. The evidence on the source of the change is less clear cut. Three competing visions of
the source of change are discussed: (a) The ontogenic and sociogenic model that describes how
biology and socialization produce changes in average traits. This approach does not explain why
individuals develop with different trajectories; (b) The biological and pharmacological model
that describes how alterations in the biology of the person can explain variations in personality
and its evolution; and (c) The intervention/family influence model that describes how investment
and environments influence changes. No study considers all three sources of development at the
same time, largely due to data limitations. The evidence from the intervention and family
influence studies suggests that interventions that target personality may be effective but much
further evidence is required to specify the exact mechanisms through which the interventions
work.

Main Variable(s)
Outcome(s): risk aversion –
choice whether to accept a realstakes lottery vs. a certain
payment

Explanatory Variable(s): shortterm gender environment –
whether the student was assigned
to a coed or single-sex group
during the experiment; long-term
gender environment – whether
the student attends a coed or
single-sex school
Outcome(s): demand for
information – whether people
request the results of their IQ
and numeracy tests;
overconfidence – the difference
between ex-ante estimate of
quintile in the IQ distribution
and the true quintile in the IQ
distribution
Explanatory Variable(s): selfassessment – before and after
test assessments of the quintile
of performance on the tests;
personality – a self-reported
measure of harm avoidance,
social closeness, social potency,
and stress reaction

Data and Methods
Data: Collected by the
authors; 260 students in
grades 10 and 11 from
eight publicly funded
schools in England
(2007)

Methods: probit, IV,
propensity score
matching

Data: Collected by
authors, administrative
data from a human
resources department;
1,063 trainee truckers
from a U.S. trucking
company
Methods: probit,
ordered probit, linear
spline

Causal Evidence
Controls: n/a

Timing of Measurements: The
measures are contemporaneous.

Main Result(s)
Girls from coed high schools in England were 36%
(p<0.01) less likely to accept a real-stakes lottery. Girls
assigned to experimental group with all girls were 12%
(p<0.10) more likely to accept the lottery than girls in
coed experimental groups.

Theory: Growing up in an
environment with males might cause
girls to act more “feminine” and take
fewer risks. Similarly, boys in coed
environments might exhibit more
risk-taking in coed environments to
try to impress girls.
Controls: actual test performance,
harm avoidance, education levels,
ethnicity, sex, age, age squared,
household income, before test belief,
and post-test belief
Timing of Measurements: People are
asked about their expected
performance on the IQ and numeracy
tests before and after they take the
test. Later, they are given the option
to receive the results of their tests.
Theory: People misjudge their own
ability due to systematically biased
noisy signals; value their selfassessed ability and avoid updating
when the assessment is positive; or
sub-consciously misrepresent their
own ability for strategic advantage.

Demand for information: A one quintile increase in a
person's post-test belief about their test performance is
positively associated with 3.0 percentage point higher
probability of demanding information about the IQ test
(p<0.01) and a 3.9 percentage point higher probability
of demanding information about the numeracy test
(p<0.01).
Overconfidence: Harm avoidance and stress reaction
are negatively correlated with overconfidence on the
IQ test (p<0.01,p<0.05). Social potency is positively
linked to overconfidence on the IQ test (p<0.01). Stress
reaction is negatively associated with overconfidence
on the numeracy test (p<0.01). Social potency is
positively associated with overconfidence on the
numeracy test (p<0.05).

Explanatory Variable(s):
predictable risk – predictions
from modeling risk based on
observables; idiosyncratic risk –
realization of risk in the net
period
Outcome(s): trust – willingness
to “invest” in a real-stakes twoplayer trust game; risk
preference – real stakes trust
game played against a computer
that randomly gave payoffs;
altruism – the amount
transferred back by the investee
in the trust game (there are no
monetary incentives to do so)
Explanatory Variable(s):
biological determinant of trust –
nasal spray of oxytocin

Methods: Spearman
correlations, OLS

Causal Evidence
Controls: (1) sex, age, height,
parental education , 2002 household
wealth, 2003 household income

Timing of Measurements: The
measures are contemporaneous.
Theory: People might have a stable,
underlying preference for risk cross
contexts.
Controls: the menu of benefits the
employee faced, predictable and
idiosyncratic risk

Main Result(s)
Determinants of risk attitude: being female and age are
negatively associated with willingness to take risks
(p<0.01). Height is positively associated with a general
willingness to take risks (p<0.01). Mother and father's
education is positively associated with willingness to
take risks (p<0.01).

Stability of risk: The 6 measures of contextualized risk
aversion are correlated with each, other ranging from
0.456 – 0.609.
The average correlations between the various domains
are 0.164. results withstand several robustness checks.

Timing of Measurements: Most of
the financial decisions were made in
the same year.
Theory: There is an underlying
preference for risk that applies across
many contexts.

Data: Experiment
conducted by the
authors; 194 male
university students in
Germany
Methods: MannWhitney U-test, RCT

Controls: n/a (RCT)
Timing of Measurements: The
measure were contemporaneous.
Theory: There is a notion of “trust”
distinct from altruism and risk
preference.

People who receive the oxytocin nasal spray invest on
average 17% more than those who do not (p<0.05).
Risk behavior does not differ between the two groups.
Trustees do not show more altruistic behavior when
given oxytocin.

Summary and Conclusions

We summarize this chapter by providing provisional answers to the eight questions posed in
Section 1.
(1) How can we fit psychological constructs of personality into an economic framework?

Can conventional models of preferences in economics characterize the main theories in
personality psychology?
We have defined personality as a response function of agents that depends on situations
(including incentives), endowments of traits, information, and resources within a
conventional economic model. Psychologists analyze a richer class of actions than
economists normally consider. We show how to integrate these actions into economic
theory. The leading models of personality psychology are special cases of our model.237
(2) What are the main measurement systems used in psychology for representing personality

and personality traits, and how are they validated? How are different systems related to
each other? What is the relationship between standard measures of personality and
measures of psychopathology and child temperament?
In Section 5, we exposit the main systems for measuring personality, focusing primarily,
but not exclusively, on the Big Five model. We consider the strengths and limitations of
the systems and the relationships among competing systems. We show how measures of
psychopathology are extreme manifestations of personality traits and how child
temperament is related to adult traits. We link specific diagnoses of pathology with
conventional measures of psychological traits.
Freudian models of the unconscious would make the traits that govern behavior, and especially  , unknown to
agents but nonetheless governing choices. A pure model of behaviorism would feature the effects of constraints on
choices. Borghans, Duckworth, Heckman et al. [2008] develop such a model. We review it in the Web Appendix.

(3) What is the relationship between economic preference parameters and psychological

measurements?
We review an emerging body of research that relates economic preference parameters
(risk aversion, time preference, ambiguity aversion, social preferences) to the Big Five
traits and to measures of self-esteem and personal control that are linked to the Big Five
traits. Time preference is negatively correlated with IQ and the ability to control
attention. Risk preference is negatively correlated with IQ and other measures of
cognition. Higher IQ people are more consistent in their choices under uncertainty.
While risk aversion is related to personality traits, the available evidence suggests that
marginal ambiguity aversion is not. Social preferences are predicted by measured
personality traits, but the evidence on this question is not strong.
(4) How stable across situations and over the life cycle are preference parameters and

personality traits?
We review the history of the person-situation debate between the social psychologists
who maintain the primacy of the situation in determining behavior and the traits theorists
who maintain the primacy of traits in explaining behavior. Behavioral economists, as a
group, have adopted the situationist point of view. Extreme advocates of the situationist
point of view claim that there is no personality construct. The issue hinges on the
nonlinearity of action, effort, and productivity functions. In the presence of such
nonlinearities, measured traits (e.g., actions) depend on situations and tasks.
A large body of evidence suggests that nonlinearity is an empirically important
phenomenon. Nonetheless, a large body of evidence suggests that there are stable
personality traits that predict a variety of behaviors in different situations. Personality is

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
219
not an ephemeral creation of situations, nor is its manifestation invariant across
situations. Moreover, personality traits are not set in stone. They change over the life
cycle. The evidence on the stability of preference parameters across situations and over
life cycle is less ample. There is evidence that standard separable models of preferences
are inadequate descriptions of choice behavior. There is little evidence on the stability or
instability of preference parameters over the life cycle.
(5) What is the evidence on the predictive power of cognitive and personality traits?
We present a large body of evidence that shows strong associations between personality
traits and educational, labor market, health, and criminal outcomes.
(6) What is the evidence on the causal power of personality on behavioral outcomes?
Few of the correlational studies relating personality to outcomes have a firm causal basis.
Personality psychologists do not yet attempt to establish the causal status of personality.
There are, however, a few experimental manipulations that establish the causal effect of
personality. Recent studies in economics establish causal status of certain personality
traits on outcomes for observational studies invoking assumptions that are inevitably
subject to debate. Research in this area is likely to flourish in the coming years.
(7) Can personality be altered across the life cycle? Are interventions that change

personality traits likely fruitful avenues for policy?
There is a small but growing body of intervention studies that establish that personality
traits can be altered over long periods of time in response to interventions. Some of the
major effects of early childhood intervention programs appear to operate through their
lasting effects on personality. Family investment decisions also change personality. The

Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
220
evidence to date suggests that interventions that boost personality traits can be effective
in promoting adult success.
(8) Do the findings from psychology suggest that conventional economic theory should be

enriched?
The evidence from psychology enriches economics by providing a more nuanced
interpretation of human choice and actions. It promises to provide a deeper
understanding of conventional economic preference parameters and how they arise.
Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, this promise remains unfulfilled. Given the
current state of evidence against conventional economic preference specifications (see,
e.g., Starmer [2000] and the evidence in Section 6), this line of research is very
promising.
