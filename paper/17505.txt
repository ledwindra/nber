ABSTRACT
This paper assesses the impact of variable investment-linked deferred annuities (VILDAs) on lifecycle
consumption, saving, and portfolio allocation patterns given stochastic and systematic mortality. Insurers
have taken two approaches to manage systematic mortality risks, namely self-insurance and risk transfer
to purchasers of the annuity products. We demonstrate that self-insurance leads to high loadings, so
that households offered a choice would favor the risk transfer scheme. Reservation loadings on the
actuarially fair VILDA price for non-participation are 0.5-8%; if insurers cannot hedge within this
range, they will transfer systematic longevity risks to the annuitants. Our findings have implications
for new payout products that may be attractive to older households seeking to protect against retirement
shortfalls.

Lifecycle Portfolio Choice with Systematic Longevity Risk
and Variable Investment-Linked Deferred Annuities

1. Introduction
Many defined contribution pension plans currently do not offer access to annuities during
the accumulation or the decumulation phase.1 Indeed, most product innovation in the last decade
has focused on the accumulation phase seeking to attract and diversify workers’ retirement
saving via target maturity date and balanced funds (c.f. Gomes, Kotlikoff and Viceira 2008). Yet
attention is now turning to the decumulation phase, so financial advisers can help their clients
manage their portfolio drawdown process during retirement. Previous research on dynamic
portfolio choice over the lifecycle suggests that payout annuities with immediate and life-contingent
benefit streams are key to protect the consumption needs of risk-averse households having uncertain
lifetimes.2 Yet despite the theoretical attractiveness of payout annuities, many consumers are reluctant
to annuitize their wealth voluntarily.3 Explanations for the divergence between theoreticallypredicted and actual behavior include incomplete annuity markets, bequest motives, high costs
charged by life annuity providers, and behavioral factors.4 Nevertheless, some advocates of
annuitization have proposed that annuities be used as a default option in tax-sheltered pension plans.

1

Benartzi, Previtero, and Thaler (2011) note that only 21 percent of defined contribution plans in the U.S. even offer
annuities as an option.
2
The seminal research by Yaari (1965) has been followed by a long list of authors; most recently see Davidoff, Brown, and
Diamond (2005) and Horneff, Maurer, Mitchell and Stamos (2009, 2010).
3
In 2011 sales of fixed annuities stood at only $20 billion and of variable annuities $40 billion (LIMRA 2011), as
compared to over $18 trillion in retirement assets (ICI 2011).
4
Schaus (2005) noted that fewer than one out of ten defined contribution participants opted for an annuity when it was
available. Recent reviews of the literature include Horneff, Maurer, Mitchell and Dus (2007); Hu and Scott (2007);
and Yagi and Nishigaki (1993).

2

For this reason, deferred life annuities are now attracting attention from policymakers, regulators,
and financial intermediaries.5
As with immediate payout annuities, deferred annuities promise lifelong periodic
payments to the annuitant in exchange for a non-refundable premium. Whereas the immediate
annuity begins paying from the date of purchase, a deferred annuity starts paying benefits as of
some pre-specified future date. Due to discounting, as well as the possibility that the annuitant
might die before payouts start, the deferred payout annuity will be much less expensive than an
immediate annuity with identical payouts. Indeed the low price of deferred annuities may help
overcome psychological barriers to voluntary annuitization. Milevsky (2005), for example,
argues that most individuals will refrain from irreversibly annuitizing substantial lump sums at
retirement, independent of their understanding of individual longevity risk.
Previous studies (e.g. Horneff, Maurer, and Rogalla 2010) focus on deferred annuities
that pay flat or fixed lifetime benefits. By contrast, here we examine variable investment-linked
deferred annuities (VILDAs) which offer both an investment element, in terms of a mutual fundstyle subaccount, and an insurance element, in terms of pooling longevity risks across the retiree
group. Payments begin when the deferring period is over and continue for life, while the benefit
paid depends on the performance of the underlying asset portfolio (stocks, bonds, or some
combination). Our goal is to assess theoretically how households might value these lifecontingent benefit streams over the lifecycle, under a range of different assumptions regarding
uncertain longevity risk. First we study how variable investment-linked deferred annuities
influence household optimal consumption patterns as well as portfolio allocations across stocks,
bonds, and VILDAs in a world with idiosyncratic yet without systematic longevity risk, i.e.
5

For instance Gale, Iwry, John, and Walker (2008) propose automatic annuitization for 401(k) assets when US
employees retiree; in Singapore, the government has recently mandated deferred annuitization (Fong, Mitchell, and
Koh 2011).

3

unknown individual lifetimes but non-stochastic mortality tables. Second, we show how results
change once we also account for systematic longevity risk, i.e. stochastic variation of general
mortality patterns over time.
A large literature has developed over the last two decades seeking to model the stochastic
development of human mortality patterns over time.6 In their foundational work, Lee and Carter
(1992) introduced a simple discrete-time one-factor model for the central death rate and
employed it to describe US mortality rates over time. While this model was able to trace the
(downward sloping) time trend in mortality, the one-factor approach implies perfect correlation
of mortality innovations over all ages, which contradicts empirical evidence. Subsequently
developed stochastic mortality models (e.g. Cairns, Blake, and Dowd, 2006b; Renshaw and
Haberman 2003), seek to remedy this by taking a multi-factor approach.
Naturally the impact of systematic mortality risk on household welfare depends on how
insurers manage and, hence, price systematic longevity risk, and various strategies are available.
One approach, feasible only for large diversified providers, is to build up a ‘natural’ hedge
through a second business line reciprocally affected by general mortality developments (such as
life insurance; c.f. Milevsky and Promislow 2001, Gatzert and Wesker 2010). McCarthy and
Mitchell (2010), however, question the effectiveness of such a hedge in practice. Alternatively,
the insurer might seek to hedge this exposure using capital market instruments such as mortality
swaps, making fixed payments in exchange for variable payments linked to the development of
an underlying survival index. Currently, however, the market for mortality-linked products is
still underdeveloped (Blake and Burrows 2001; Cowley and Cummins 2005) so it is questionable

6

For a detailed discussion of alternative approaches see Pitacco, Denuit, Haberman and Olivieri (2009), Cairns,
Blake, Dowd (2006a), as well as Cairns, Blake, Dowd, Coughlan, Epstein, and Khalaf-Allah (2010).

whether an insurer with a substantial exposure to systematic mortality risk would be able to
purchase an adequate amount of insurance against this sort of longevity risk.
The present paper focuses on two risk management approaches that are independent of
firm size and capital market solutions: insurer self-insurance, and risk pool participation. Under
the self-insurance strategy, providers will set the VILDA price so that they run little chance that
benefits paid to annuitants will exceed provider reserves. Under the risk pool participation
approach, the VILDA provider can refrain from taking systematic mortality risks into its books
by only offering products which have annuitants participate in the development of general lifeexpectancy by adjusting benefit payments to unanticipated mortality shocks.7
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the fundamental
characteristics of VILDAs. Section 3 draws out lifecycle implications of including VILDAs in
the household portfolio, assuming non-stochastic mortality tables. In the next Section, we
introduce systematic longevity risk and its effect on optimal lifecycle behavior. Section 5
concludes.

2. Variable Investment-Linked Deferred Payout Annuities
An immediate investment-linked payout annuity is a financial contract between a retiree
and a life insurance company, whereby in exchange for paying an initial (non-refundable)
premium, the annuitant immediately begins to receive lifelong payments equal to the value of a
pre-specified number of units on a specific asset portfolio, usually represented by mutual funds.
As payments depend on the value of the annuity funds units (FUs), they can be stochastic when
7

This is similar in spirit to the group self-annuitization model proposed by Piggott, Valdez, and Denzel (2005), and
the product on offer by the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association (TIAA) through its fellow life insurer, the
College Retirement Equities Fund (CREF). Here benefit payments evolve according to the mortality experience of
covered participants; see Weil and Fisher (1974) and Brown, Mitchell, Poterba, and Warshawsky (2001) for more
information on the TIAA-CREF model.

the underlying assets are held in risky assets. The buyer of the variable annuity can influence (in
practice within some bounds) how the assets are invested in various asset categories (e.g.
equities, bonds, real estate) while bearing both the risk and reward of that portfolio.
In the case of a (variable) investment-linked deferred annuity, the insurance premium
generates lifelong payments which begin at some future age , i.e. the end of the deferral period.

In contrast to fixed immediate payout annuities, VILDA payouts depend on the asset
allocation in the underlying fund, as well as the deferral period. The classic immediate fixed
annuity is a special case, whereby the assets inside the annuity consist entirely of risk-free bonds,
the

is set equal to the riskless interest rate (i.e.

), and the deferral age

equals the

age of purchase. To illustrate the effects of deferral on VILDA annuity benefits, Figure 1 shows
for alternative deferral periods the range of payments (defined by the 5:95% quantiles). These
are derived by simulating 10,000,000 payment paths of an annuity with a constant 50/50
allocation over risk-free bonds and risky equities.8
Figure 1 here
Here the payout possibility frontier for an immediate variable annuity is represented by
the dotted line from age 65, which begins at 6.9% of the initial premium paid. Thereafter, the
lower line (5% quantile) slopes down with age, and if the retiree survives to age 80, the payout
rate would only be 3.8%. This worsening risk over time results from the downside volatility of
equity returns. The 95% quantile curve gradually increases to about 11.3% for the retiree who is
still alive at age 80. The Figure illustrates two implications of deferring the annuity payouts.
First, the spread for the first payment (assuming survival to age 65) is increasing in the deferral
period. The range for a five-year deferral period is 6.2-11.6%; for the 10 year deferral, it is 6.515.9%. Second, conditional on survival, both the up- and the downside payout profiles are
improved. We note that this comes at the cost of a larger chance of dying before the payments
start.

Here the risk-free rate is set to 2% p.a. and the gross equity returns are log-normally distributed with a mean of 6%
percent and a standard deviation of 20%. Annuity premiums are based on the 2007 U.S. female population mortality
table as provided by the Human Mortality Database, incorporating a trend in mortality rates calibrated to the
changes in U.S. female mortality between years 1933 and 2007 (see Section 4.2 for details).The

3. VILDAs under Systematic Mortality Risk
3.1 Price and Benefit Dynamics
VILDAs transfer investment risks to the annuitants. Longevity risks, however, still
remain with the insurer. While pooling a sufficient number of annuitants allows the insurer to
manage the idiosyncratic part of longevity risk, it does not provide a hedge against the systematic
longevity risk, for which other means are required. In this paper we focus on two approaches
VILDA providers have at hand for managing systematic mortality risks: insurer self-insurance,
and risk pool participation.
Following the self-insurance strategy, the provider retains the systematic longevity risk
and sets the VILDA price (measured in FUs) to ensure a sufficiently high probability that the
number of FUs paid to the annuitants does not exceed the number of FUs in the provider’s
reserves. We define the adequately high level as α. Formally, the price Π for the risk quantile α
is the number of FUs that satisfies the following condition:

stochastic and depend on the state of the mortality process at time t as well as its future
development. Accordingly the annuity prices also depend on the state of the mortality process.
Obviously, these prices are not actuarially fair but include premiums for insuring against adverse
mortality developments.

When following the participation strategy, we assume that VILDA providers charge a fair
price based on the actuarial principle of equivalence for new annuity purchases. Hence, at time t

At the same time, unanticipated future mortality developments will be passed through to the

3.2 Implied Loadings and Benefit Variation
Next, we want to illustrate the quantitative impact of systematic mortality risk on the
prices and the benefit structures of the two alternative VILDA types presented in the previous
section. To this end, we have to first specify a model for stochastic mortality. Here, we adopt the
parsimonious two-factor model by Cairns, Blake, and Dowd (2006b) where the logits of the

The implications of this stochastic mortality model may be observed in Figure 2, which
presents the simulated distribution of the -period survival probabilities for an individual initially
aged 20. The graph shows that the probabilities of living to advanced ages exhibit significant
dispersion. For example, the probability of attaining age 70 (i.e.

20,70 ) spans the range from

79-93%, with a median of 87%; the probability of surviving to age 100,

20,100 , spans the

range 0.02-45%, with a median of 9%. These results suggest that the expected lifetime remaining
from age 20 varies between 56.7 and 73.8 years, with a median of 64.5 years. This compares to
20,70

80% and

20,100

4% with an expected lifetime remaining from age 20 of

59.7 years, if we were to neglect both the trend and the volatility of the mortality process and use
only

to derive a static life table as of age of 20. In other words, using this stochastic mortality

model, future survival rates and years of life remaining are likely to exceed those derived from
the deterministic scenario.
Figure 2 here
With this model for stochastic mortality at hand, we first assess the impact of systematic
longevity risk on VILDA prices under the self-insurance strategy, where systematic longevity
risk is borne by the insurer. To this end, we calculate the age-dependent implied loadings for preselected confidence levels α (see Equation 4). For each initial age, these are derived by sampling
10,000,000 realizations of the stochastic mortality process until the terminal age (120). For each
sample path we then calculate the expected number of FUs paid to an annuitant in order to derive
the distribution of VILDA prices. To get an estimate of the implied loading, we subsequently
relate the number of FUs paid at the quantile α to the average number of FUs paid.

11

As shown in Figure 3, these price increases can be substantial, especially for younger
annuitants. At age 20, for example, VILDA providers must charge loadings on top of the
actuarially fair premium of around 32% to maintain a 99.99% confidence level (to be used in
what follows). At the 99.5% confidence level, loadings must amount to over 20% for this age
group. At later ages, the dispersion of possible future mortality outcomes decreases and so does
the implied loading. Nevertheless at age 66, just before VILDA payments commence, the
loadings required to meet the 99.99% (99.5%) confidence level still amount to around 14% (9%).
Figure 3 here
Next we turn attention to participating VILDAs that transfer systematic longevity risk to
the annuitants. Figure 4 presents the mean as well as the 5:95% quantiles of the simulated
adjustment factors for ages 20-120. The mean periodic adjustment factor, as discussed, is 1 until
the deferral age 67 and then drops to 1

1

0.03

0.971 for the remainder of

the lifecycle (see Equations 6 and 7). Over almost the entire deferral period, the 5:95% quantiles
of the periodic adjustment factors span the range 0.98-1.02, meaning that (notional) claims to FU
payments may increase/decrease by around 2% per period. Later, during the payout phase, this
span widens to a maximum of 0.93-1.01 by age 105. Hence, while payments (measured in FUs)
are projected to decrease by the factor of 0.971 per period, unexpected decreases in mortality
might result in an additional periodic drop in FUs paid of 4%; in the case of mortality increases,
payments in FUs might actually rise by 1%.
Figure 4 here
To assess the impact of accumulated adjustment factors on the benefits of participating
VILDAs, Figure 5 presents the simulated distribution of actual FU payments relative to the
expected number of FUs paid at a given age. Based on our simulations, at age 67, the initial

12

number of FUs paid at the 5% quantile falls short of the expected value by around 11%. At the
95% quantile, on the other hand, the annuitant receives almost 14% more FUs. Over the
subsequent years, the dispersion increases slowly, spanning the range -18-25% at age 100 and 23-30% just before the end of our projection at age 119.
Figure 5 here

4 Integrating VILDAs into a Lifecycle Consumption and Portfolio Choice Model
Next we draw out the lifecycle implications of including VILDAs in the household
investment portfolio.
4.1 Model and Calibration
To this end, we build a discrete-time lifecycle consumption and portfolio choice model
for a utility-maximizing household that draws time-separable CRRA utility from consumption
and has access to incomplete markets for risk-free bonds, risky stocks, and VILDAs. The
household’s decision period begins at the age of 20 and ends at the outside age (

of 120. Every

year the household has to decide how much to consume ( ), how much of both liquid and
annuitized wealth to invest in risk-free bonds (

and

respectively), and, prior to the

retirement and deferral age ( ), how much to spend buying new annuities (

. During the

worklife, the household earns an exogenously-determined level of risky labor income, consisting
of a deterministic trend (

as well as permanent (

and transitory

shocks. After

retirement, the household receives a constant fraction of the last (permanent) salary as in the
form of lifetime pension benefits. Throughout the lifecycle, the household is exposed to
idiosyncratic as well as systematic longevity risk in the form of stochastic mortality rates.

13

After normalizing by permanent labor income, the household’s optimization problem can
be described by the following Bellman equation:

distributed with mean 1.06 and standard deviation of 0.20. The logs of transitory ( ) and
permanent (

labor earnings shocks are uncorrelated and normally distributed with zero mean

and standard deviations equal to 22.5% and 10%, respectively. The mortality process is
calibrated to the U.S. female population mortality tables over the period 1933-2007, as provided
by the Human Mortality Database (see Section 3.2). Moreover, we posit that the pairwise
correlations between shocks in mortality rates, labor income, and stock market return are all
equal to zero. Finally, we set the assumed interest rate (

to 3%, such that expected annuity

payments in retirement are constant each period.
We solve the optimization problem using value function iteration as described in Carroll
(2011). To this end, we discretize the following subset of the state space (wealth W, annuity L,

function outside the supporting points, we employ linear tensor interpolation for the reason of
stability and computational speed. Based on the optimal policy controls, we then simulate
1,000,000 cross-sectional independent lifecycles.
4.2 Optimal Household Behavior with VILDAs
Now, we describe optimal annuitization, asset allocation, and consumption profiles with
VILDA annuities, assuming a static life-table (though stochastic individual survival). To this
end, we set the covariance matrix of the mortality process (Σ) to zero.12 In each case, we present
the expected as well as the 5:95% quantiles of the simulated distributions.
Table 1 reports annuity purchases (Panel A) as well as annuity payments (Panel B) at
various ages. On average, households will begin to buy VILDAs in their late 30s. At age 40,
27% of the initial labor income is invested on average in VILDAs. Over the next two decades,
the value of periodic annuity purchases rises to over half of the worker’s first year labor income.
At age 67, the last period when VILDAs can be purchased, these investments amount to slightly
more than one times first-year labor income. Age 67 is also the point at which deferred VILDA
payouts commence, and initially they amount to 1.84 times first labor income (on average). With
expected investment returns slightly exceeding the

, average benefit payments slowly

increase during retirement – to 2.07 (2.33) times the initial labor income at age 80 (100),
conditional on survival. Looking at the tail of the annuity payment distribution, we find that even
at the 5% quantile, VILDA payments come to a substantial 60% of first year’s labor income.
Table 1 here
Next we report optimal lifecycle asset allocation patterns within the VILDA annuity
portion of the portfolio. Table 2 indicates that, on average, households will hold most of VILDA
assets in stocks for most of their active working lives; only in their 50s will they start shifting

more funds into bonds. This is a typical result for lifecycle asset allocation studies that account
for periodic labor income that is not highly correlated with stock returns.13 During the retirement
phase, the average allocation of VILDA assets to bonds remains at around 60%. Households do,
however, make use of the investment flexibility within the VILDAs. Looking at the 5% and the
95% quantile of the bond share, there is substantial lifecycle variation: for instance at age 45
(50), between 0-64% (0-61%) of VILDA assets are held in bonds. This band narrows later in life,
but bond fractions in retirement still range from 45 to 67%.
Table 2 here
Table 3 summarizes the impact of having access to VILDAs on household consumption.
Being able to insure against unexpected individual longevity risk reduces the need to build up
financial reserves for financing retirement. Accordingly, households which can access VILDAs
during their worklives are able to maintain higher consumption levels over their entire lifetimes.
Compared to households that lack access to VILDAs, the rise in mean consumption is small
early on, but it increases measurably during the worklife – from around 1.5% at age 20, to over
5% in the late 50s and 60s. Subject to household survival, VILDAs prove to be of particular
value late in life. Households that do not buy longevity insurance tend to deplete their financial
assets, but VILDA purchasers continue to receive annuity payments. Consequently, the gap in
consumption opportunities increases even further toward the end of the lifecycle, on average
amounting to over 16% at age 80 and to more than 19% at age 100. These enhanced
consumption opportunities are rather stable over the whole distribution of possible consumption
outcomes, in that the 5:95% consumption quantiles are comparable in magnitude to the average
consumption increments.

4.3 The Impact of Systematic Mortality Risk on Household Behavior
In this section, we examine the lifecycle implications of including VILDAs in the
household portfolio including systematic mortality table risk. We discuss the implications of
introducing either of the two previously-discussed VILDA types (with and without participation)
on households’ optimal profiles of consumption, annuitization, and asset allocation within
VILDA annuities, assuming the stochastic evolution process for mortality developed above. In
each case, we again present the expected as well as the 5:95% quantiles of the simulated
distributions.
The pattern of variable annuity purchases and payouts at various ages is summarized in
Table 4. An average investor with access to participating VILDAs will begin buying these in his
late 30s; at age 40, periodic annuity purchases amount to 10% of his first-year’s labor income.
Purchases continue to rise to around 55% of initial labor income over the next period, and then
they remain almost constant over the following two decades. Only at age 67, the end of the
deferral period, will the investor boost investments to 1.2 times initial labor income (as this is the
last opportunity to purchase additional VILDAs). Average initial benefits amount to about 1.7
times first-year labor income. As expected investment returns slightly exceed the

, VILDA

benefits slowly increase to 1.96 (2.2) times initial labor income by age 80 (100).
Table 4 here
If consumers are only able to purchase non-participating VILDAs calculated based on the
quantile pricing approach, they will postpone annuitization by an average of approximately 5
years. They begin buying the non-participating VILDAs in their early 40s, trading off relatively
higher prices resulting from the higher chance of being alive when benefits commence, versus
relatively lower prices due to lower exposure to systematic mortality risk. Wishing to make up

18

for delayed annuity purchases, investors in their late 40s must shift more financial assets into
nonparticipating annuities, compared to investors with access to participating VILDAs. Wishing
to make up for delayed annuity purchases, investors in their late 40’s must shift more financial
assets into annuities than would investors with access to participating VILDAs. At age 50 (60),
the average household invests a sum equivalent to around 89% (107%) of the first-year labor
income into new non-participating VILDA purchases, 60% (100%) more than consumers buying
participating VILDAs. Again, purchases peak at age 67 (1.39 times first-year labor income),
marking the last time investors can purchase additional VILDAs. Despite having spent
substantially more on new annuities over the last two decades of their working lives, the average
household’s initial non-participating VILDA benefits worth 1.6 times first-year labor income fall
short of those holding participating VILDAs, by almost 10%. This difference persists to the end
of the lifecycle.
Participating VILDAs must, on average, outperform non-participating VILDAs due to the
lack of loading related to systematic mortality risks; nevertheless their lower price comes at the
cost of exposing annuitants to systematic mortality risk. As discussed in Section 3.2, this could
result in measurably lower VILDA benefits, especially later in the lifecycle. Hence, it is of
interest to see how the distributional tails of the benefit payments for both types of annuities
relate to each other. Panel B of Table 4 shows that participating VILDAs, despite exposing
annuitants to systematic mortality risk, provide benefits that exceed those of non-participating
annuities at the 5th as well as the 95th percentiles. Apparently, the lower price of participating
VILDAs allows households to buy enough additional longevity insurance to more than
compensate for possible benefit reductions caused by decreasing general mortality.

19

The asset allocation patterns in Table 5 indicate that neither the introduction of
systematic mortality risks nor the specific VILDA design (participating vs. non-participating) has
a major impact on the distribution of VILDA funds over the alternative asset classes. Again,
average VILDA bond fractions increase toward the end of the worklife and remain stable during
retirement, while the bond share dispersion remains between 40-70% in retirement.
Table 5 here
The welfare-enhancing effects of having access to VILDAs are represented in Table 6
where we summarize the consumption increases available to consumers in various scenarios.
Already by age 20, the household that purchases participating VILDAs are (on average) able to
afford about 1.3% more consumption, compared to their counterparts in a world without
VILDAs. This number rises to around 3.5% at age 40 and to over 4% by age 60. This can be
attributed to the lower need to build up (liquid) wealth to finance consumption at very high ages
when being insured against unexpected individual longevity. As in the last section without
systematic mortality risk, VILDAs prove to be particularly valuable for those who attain
advanced ages. Average consumption of households aged 80 that have VILDA income exceeds
consumption of equally aged households in a no-VILDA world by 12.5%, a number that
increases to above 25% for those who reach age 100. Again, we find these enhancements of
consumption opportunities to be rather stable over the whole distribution of possible
consumption outcomes.
Table 6 here
Having access to non-participating VILDAs also enables households to afford higher
consumption over the whole lifecycle. As previously discussed, however, the substantial
loadings resulting from the VILDA provider’s need to self-insure against adverse systematic

20

mortality developments significantly drive up VILDA prices. While spending more of their
financial resources on VILDAs, households acquire lower benefits. This increases the need for
liquid wealth later in life. Both effects result in lower average excess consumption compared to
households with access to participating VILDAs. At age 20, average consumption is just less
than 1% above that of households in a world without VILDAs. At age 60, this difference only
comes to about 2.3% (and 18.4% at age 100); excess average consumption falls short by 7%
compared to households that own participating VILDAs. Looking at the tails, we again find
comparably stable rates of excess consumption over the whole distribution of consumption
outcomes.
In our set-up, despite exposing individuals to systematic mortality risks, participating
VILDAs outperform non-participating VILDAs consumption-wise and hence should be
preferred by households seeking to maximize utility from consumption. This is undoubtedly
related to the substantial loadings that many providers charge in order to self-insure against the
systematic longevity risk in non-participating VILDAs. Against this background, it is of interest
to estimate the maximum premium that households would be willing to pay in order to be
relieved of systematic mortality risks. For various ages and wealth levels, these premiums are
presented in Table 7. To calculate these numbers, we solve for the loading charge in excess of
the actuarially fair price of a non-participating VILDA that equates the utility drawn from the
non-participating VILDA with the utility from a participating VILDA. Here we identify two
effects: break-even loadings are increasing in the household’s age, but decreasing in wealth. At
age 40, a household with wealth amounting to twice first-year labor income would be willing to
pay a premium of 1.52% on an actuarially fair (non-participating) VILDA price to insure against
systematic longevity risk. While systematic mortality risks are higher for younger households (as

21

per Section 3.2), they affect households financially only in the remote future. For this reason,
they are outweighed by more imminent financial risks including labor income shocks. As
retirement and deferral age near, the relative importance of systematic mortality risk increases
and so does the household’s willingness to pay for insurance. At age 65, for example, someone
with the same wealth level (twice first-year labor income) would pay a premium of 7.7%. With
increasing wealth, households are less dependent on VILDAs for financing consumption in
retirement and, hence, less willing to pay for stable VILDA payouts. Households with wealth of
five times first-year labor income at age 40 (65) would only accept a premium of 0.69% (4.79%)
over the actuarially fair (non-participating) VILDA price.
Table 7 here
These results have an important implication for risk management by VILDA providers.
First, VILDAs are likely to be usefully targeted at younger households, since this group is most
likely to profit from the benefit of deferral. Second, this group may not be willing to pay for
insurance against systematic mortality risk. Unless insurers have access to inexpensive hedges
against systematic longevity risks, annuitants may be better off by bearing systematic mortality
risk themselves via participating VILDAs.

5. Conclusions
This paper has discussed the key role of variable investment-linked deferred annuities
(VILDAs) in household portfolio and consumption choices over the lifecycle. Inasmuch as their
payments are deferred, VILDAs can be viewed as a privately-financed complement to
governmental social security schemes. Permitting investment choice within VILDAs gives
households greater flexibility to achieve their individually-optimal asset mixes, while permitting

22

annuity providers to transfer investment risk back to the purchaser pool. Of special interest is the
performance of VILDAs under both deterministic and stochastic mortality processes, and we
explore two approaches to managing systematic mortality risks which do not rely on financial
markets or other hedging instruments. Consistent with what is empirically observed, some
annuity providers elect to self-insure their position by demanding higher than actuarially fair
premiums, while others can transfer systematic mortality risks to their buyers by adjusting
payouts as actual mortality developments unfold.
Our results imply that households benefit from gaining access to VILDAs, as measured
by markedly higher consumption over the entire lifecycle. Moreover, households can use the
flexibility of VILDAs to invest significant portions of their annuity assets in equities. We also
show that the self-insurance approach to managing systematic mortality risks leads to substantial
annuity loadings that may exceed 30% for younger annuitants. Nevertheless, households are still
better off with than without VILDAs. Given the choice, however, many households will prefer to
participate in systematic mortality risk unless the insurer can hedge them at a significantly lower
price. Depending on their age and wealth, consumer reservation loadings on the actuarially fair
(non-participating) VILDA price vary between 0.5 and 8%. If financial markets are thin and do
not provide insurers with many hedging instruments in this price range, providers may seek to
concentrate on their core competence – pooling idiosyncratic longevity risk – and transfer
systematic mortality risk to annuitants.

assume that the pool will be fully funded at all times. Let us denote the number of individuals in

Benefits (as a multiple of initial labor income) paid by accumulated VILDAs at specified age. Non-participating
VILDA pays one initial FU at age 67 and decreasing thereafter according to the AIR (3%). Participating VILDA –
in expectation – pays one initial FU at age 67 and decreasing thereafter according to the AIR (3%). Actual benefits
vary with unexpected systematic mortality shocks. Stochastic mortality based on the Cairns et al. (2006) 2-factor
model fitted to US mortality tables from 1933-2007 (assumed maximum age is 120). Source: Authors’ calculations;

Notes: Excess consumption (in %) at specified age that household with access to VILDAs is able to afford compared
to household in non-VILDA world. Non-participating VILDA pays one initial FU at age 67 and decreasing
thereafter according to the AIR (3%). Participating VILDA – in expectation – pays one initial FU at age 67 and
decreasing thereafter according to the AIR (3%). Actual benefits vary with unexpected systematic mortality shocks.

Notes: Loadings represent the maximum price increase (in %) relative to the actuarially fair price of a nonparticipating VILDA individuals are willing to accept in order to get access to non-participating instead of
participating VILDAs. Non-participating VILDA pays one initial FU at age 67 and decreasing thereafter according
to the AIR (3%). Participating VILDA – in expectation – pays one initial FU at age 67 and decreasing thereafter
according to the AIR (3%). Actual benefits vary with unexpected systematic mortality shocks. Stochastic mortality
