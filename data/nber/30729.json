    "abstract": "\n\nWe investigate a low-income country\u2019s long run employment response to new export opportunities. The U.S.\u2013Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement reduced U.S. import tariffs on exports from Vietnam. Employment grew faster in the industries most exposed to the U.S. tariff reductions and this was driven by foreign affiliates of multinationals entering Vietnam. Foreign entrants continue to expand employment long after entry\u2013even after 16 years. Most foreign entrants are exporters and from East Asia, highlighting that opportunities created by bilateral agreements are not just limited to signing parties. Vietnam\u2019s subsequent capacity growth allows it to export to other markets over time.\n\n",
