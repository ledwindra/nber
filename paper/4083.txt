THE PRESENT VALUE MODEL OF RATIONAL COMMODITY PRICING

ABSTRACT
The present value model relates an asset's price to the sum of its discounted expected
future payoffs. I explore the limits of the model by testing its ability to explain the pricing of
storable commodities. For commodities the payoff stream is the convenience yield that accrues

from holding inventories, and it can be measured directly from spot and futures prices. Hence
the model imposes restrictions on the joint dynamics of spot and futures prices, which I test for

four commodities. I find close conformance to the model for heating oil, but not for copper or
lumber, and especially not for gold. The pattern is the same for the serial dependence of excess
returns, These results suggest that for three of the four commodities, prices at least temporarily
deviate from fundamentals.

1. Introduction.
The present vaiue model is the most basic description of rational asset pricing. It says
that price, F,, equals the sum of current and discounted expected future payoffs, or benefits,
from ownership of the asset:

F, = IE&1E1#,+,

(1)

Hence the model explains changes in asset prices in terms of 'fundarnentals," Le., changes in
expected future payoffs

or discount rates (3). Most tests of the model have used data for

stocks, where the payoffs are dividends, or bonds, where the payoffs are interest and principal
payments. These tests have had mixed outcomes, due in part to statistical and data problems.'

This paper explores the limits of the present value model by testing its ability to explain
the pricing of storable commodities. Applying the present value model to commodities is useful

for a number of reasons. First, the model is hetpful in understanding price movements, and lets

us test the rationality of commodity pricing in a way that is very different from earlier tests.
Second, these tests provide evidence of the robustness of the present value model. (If the model

is valid, it should explain the pricing of any asset that yields a payoff stream.) Third, if the
commodity is traded on a futures market, the model can be written entirely in terms of spot and

futures prices, and provides a parsimonious description of rational price dynamics.
For a storable commodity, the payoff stream , is the convenience yield that accrues from
holding inventories, i.e-, the value of any benefits that inventories provide, including the ability

'Most of these tests attempt to show excess volatility or predictability of returns. For a
discussion of such tests, see Mankiw, Romer, and Shapiro (1991). Campbell and Shiller (1987)
and Pindyck and
test restrictions implied by the model for the joint dynamics of F, and

Rotemberg (1990b) develop tests based on the correlations of returns. One problem when
applying these tests to stocks is with the measurement of payoffs; dividends and earnings are
paid and announced quarterly, but firms often make statements in advance about these variables.

-2to smooth production, avoid stockouts, and facilitate the scheduling of production and sales.
Convenience yield is the reason that firms hold inventories even when the expected capital gain

is below the risk-adjusted rate, or negative. White economists have debated the relative
importance of these different benefits, for many commodities convenience yield is quantitativety

important. As shown below, firms sometimes incurred expected costs of 5 to 10 percent pet
month - pius interest and storage costs - to maintain stocks of copper, lumber, and heating oil.

The convenience yield that accrues to the owner of a commodity is directly analogous
to the dividend on a stock. If the commodity is well defined and easily traded, and if aggregate

storage is always positive, then eqn. (1) always holds, and price must equal the present value

of the flow of expected future convenience yields. The present value model thus provides a
compact explanation for changes in a commodity's price; they are due to changes in expected
future convenience yields. We usually try to explain commodity price movements in terms of

changes in current and future demand and supply, but changes in demand and supply in tum
cause changes in current and expected future convenience yields. Hence the present value model

can be viewed as a highly reduced form version of a dynamic supply and demand model.
For some commodities, such as gold, the convenience yield is almost always very small,

and often insignificantly different from zero. The reason is that inventories, which are held
mostiy for investment" purposes, are very large relative to production (for gold, about 50 times
annual production). But the present value model also applies to such commodities, and provides

a fundamentals-based explanation of why rational investors would hold them. Investors should
hold these commodities if they think there is a large enough probability that convenience yield

will rise substantially in the future. With gold, this could occur if the metal were some day

-3monetized, which would cause inventories to fail dramatically and convenience yield to rise.
For commodities traded on futures markets, convenience yield can be measured directly

and (if the futures market is efficient in the sense that there are no arbitrage opportunities)
without error from the relation between spot and futures prices. As a result, the present value

model is also parsimonious in terms of data; tests can rely on data only for spot and futures

prices. One does not, for example, need data on inventories, production costs, or other
variables that affect supply, demand, or convenience yield.

I exploit futures price data to test the ability of the present value model to explain the
prices of four commodities — copper, lumber, heating oil, and gold. To do this, I draw
extensively on work by Campbell and Shiller (1987), who showed that the present value model

implies that the price of an asset arid its payuff stream are cointegrated, and derived testable

implications for the joint dynamics of the two I show that the present value model imposes
similar restrictions for the joint dynamics of the spot and futures prices of a storable commodity.

The basic theory is presented in the next section. I first review the arbitrage relation that
determines a commodity's convenience yield from its spot and futures prices. I then discuss the

restrictions on the joint dynamics of spot and futures prices implied by eqn. (1), and a set of
tests that follow from those restrictions. Finally, 1 also derive a present.value relation for the

ratio of convenience yield to price. This relation is similar to one derived by Campbell and
Shiller (1989) for the log dividend-price ratio of a stock, and when combined with a model for

the commodity's expected return, can be tested in the same way that (1) is.
Section 3 discusses the data and reviews the behavior of prices, convenience yields, and

excess returns for the four commodities. Tests of the present value model are presented in

-4Section

4. The results are mixed. Heating oil prices conform closely to the model, and none

of the constraints implied by (I) are rejected. Gold, however, does not conform to the model,

and copper and lumber are in between. Given these results, it is useful 10 see whether other
tests of market efficiency result in similar patterns across commodities. Section 5 examines the

serial dependence of excess returns. Cutler, Polerba, and Summers (1990) studied the serial

correlation of returns for a broad range of assets, including gold, silver, and an index of

industrial metals, but ignored convenience yield. This can lead to significant errors for
industrial commodities, where convenience yield is often a large component of returns. I find
that the extent of serial correlation in excess returns parallels conformance with the present value

model; there is no significant serial correlation for heating oil, there is some for copper and
lumber, and there is a considerable amount for gold.

2. The Present Value Model.

The present value model is given by eqn. (1), where ', is the 1-period per unit net
marginal convenience yield, i.e., the benefit flow from holding a marginal unit of the commodity

from the beginning to the end of period :, net of storage and insurance costs. Here, 5 =

l/@+),

where ji is the commodity-specific 1-period discount rate, i.e., the expected rate of

return an investor would require to hold a unit of the commodity. (Note that (1) is the solution
to the difference relation, EP,4.2

(1

constant, and can be written as=p.r

+p)P - ti'.) For the time being I will assume that p.

is

+ p, where r is the risk-free rate and is a risk premium.

Futures Prices. Stoi Prices. and Conyenience Yield.

For commodities with actively traded futures contracts, we can use futures prices to

measure the net marginal convenience yield. Let ,r be the (capitalized) flow of marginal

-5convenience yield net of storage costs over the period (to t+T, per unit of commodity. Then,
to avoid arbitrage opportunities,

must satisfy:
= (1

+ r)F, —fr,,

(2)

where F, is the spot price, f, is the forward price for delivery at r4-T, and r is the risk-free
T-period interest rate. To see why (2) must hold, note that the (stochastic) return from holding

a unit of the commodity from ito ,!+Tis + (P+ - P. If one also shorts a forward contract
at time r, one receives a total return of

+ fr,, - F,. No outlay is required for the forward

contract and this total return is non-stochastic, so it must equal r7F, from which (2) follows.

For most commodities, futures contracts are much more actively traded than forward
contracts, and futures price data are more readily available. A futures contract differs from a
forward contract only in that it is "marked to market," i.e., there is a settlement and transfer of

funds at the end of each trading day. As a result, the futures price will be greater (less) than

the forward price if lhe risk-free interest rate is stochastic and is positively (negatively)
correlated with the spot price.2 However, for most commodities the difference in the two prices

is extremely small. (See French (1983) and Pindyck (1990).) Thus I use the futures price, Fr,,

in place of the forward price in eqn. (2). Also, I work with the I-month convenience yield,

which I denote as ,, and futures pric F1,1.
Note that for the present value model to hold, inventories must always be positive, i.e.,

21f the interest rate is non-stochastic, the present value of the expected daily cash flows over
the life of the futures contract equals the present value of the expected payment at termination
of the forward contract, so the futures and forward prices must be equal. If the interest rate is
stochastic and positively correlated with the price of the commodity (as for most industrial
commodities), daily payments from price increases will on average be more heavily discounted
than payments from price decreases, so the initial futures price must exceed the forward price.

stockouts must not occur.3 We never observe aggregate inventories falling to zero in the data,

but as Kahn (1991) points out for inventories of manufactured goods, one could argue that
stockouts still occur. First, stockouts might occur with very low probability (but at very high

cost to the firm), so they are simply not observed in a sample of 20 or so years. Second, the
data aggregate inventories for different products and firms) so stockouts might occur for some
products and/or firms. But these are not likely to be problems for the commodities studied here.

First, the products are homogeneous and very clearly defined. Second, futures (and forward)
markets are extremely liquid and have low transactions costs; any firm can easily buy or sell
inventories through these markets, and therefore need never experience a stockout. Finally, I
have shown elsewhere (1990) that at least for copper, heating oil, and lumber, convenience yield

is highly convex in the aggregate level of inventories, and becomes very large as that level
becomes small, so that firms would never allow stockouts to occur.
Implications of the Present Value Model for Soot and Futures Prices.
As Campbell and Shiller (1957) have shown, if P3 and t' are both integrated of order 1,

the present value relation of eqn. (1) implies that they are cointegrated, and the cointegrating

vector is (1 -l/)'. One can therefore define a "spread,"
= P - (1/z)P, ,

(3)

which will he statioriary Hence, in principle, one could estimate the expected return on a
commodity, fL, by running a cointegrating regression of P3 and .

3Deaton and Laroque (1992) developed a model of commodity prices in which stoekouts play

a key role -- prices are usually stable, and sudden price flares are accompanied by inventory
failing to near zero. People hold inventory because price goes up more when there is a shortfall
than when there is a glut, making storage profitable. But there is no convenience yield in their
model; inventories are held only as a speculation against price shocks.

-7.-In addition, it is easily shown that (1) and (3) imply that:

5; = (lIL)E4P,1

(4)

Hence P, and ', contain all information necessary to optimally forecast P,.. If the futures
market is efficient, this is equivalent to saying that /', and F,, are sufficient to optimally forecast

P,÷1. Substituting (2) and (3) into (4) gives the standard result:
(5)

i.e., the futures price is a biased predictor of the future spot price, and the bias is equal to the
commodity's expected excess return. Thus either (4) or (5) can be used to forecast P,1 if ,u is

known. Finally Campbell and Shiller also show that (1) and (3) together imply that:

pS = E,E b'A#,.,

(6)

so that z5 is the present value of expected future changes in the convenience yield.

We can use (4) and (6) to see how futures and spot prices describe the market's
expectation of how , and F, will evolve. Assume for simplicity that & = r, so that s; =
(l/r)(F11 - PJ. (This is approximately the case for most agricultural commodities, as well as

gold.) First, suppose that , = 0, so that E,(P,41) =

F'1,,

= (1 +r)P,, and S =

r

Although

convenience yield is currently-zero in this case, people hold stocks of the commodity and
rationally expect price to rise at the rate of interest because they expect the convenience yield

to rise in the future. (In fact, F, = ES'a4,, the present value of expected future increases
in convenience yield.) This is typically the case for gold, where stocks are very large relative
to production. If holdings of gold are based on "rational fundamentals" (as opposed to a rational

bubble, in which case eqn. (1) includes a term b, satisfying b, = bE,h,÷,), it must be because
there is a chance that gold's convenience yield will rise sharply in the future.

-8Now suppose that F < F1, < (1 +r)P,, Then s > 0, and both price and convenience

yield are expected to rise. Mote that s < 0 only if V' is large enough so that F11 C F,; then
the present value of expected future changes in 4 is negative. This would mean that price and

convenience yields are expected to fall as supply and demand adjust towards long-run
equilibrium levels and inventories rise. These patterns for F, and #, can be seen in the data for

copper, where sharp increases in the spot price occurred in 1974, 1979-80, and 1988-89 as a
result of strikes and other disruptions to supply that were expected (correcUy) to be temporary.

As Campbell and Shiller (1987) have shown, eqns. (4) and (6) can be used to test the

present value model.

First, suppose j

has

been estimated (e.g., from the cointegrating

regression), and consider a vector of variables ; (e.g., production, inventories, etc.) that might

be expected to affect future spot prices. Then (4) implies that in regressions of the form:
=

+

#

+

(7)

the b1's should be groupwise insignificant. Second, eqn. (6) implies that Granger causality tests

shoutd show causality from S,' to future A4',÷1's. Finally, eqn. (6) also implies a set of crossequation restrictions on a vector autoregression of 5,' and .4',.
One problem is that if F, and V', are in nominal terms, the nominal expected return ji will

fluctuate, even if the real return is constant. Campbell and Shiller deal with this for stocks and
bonds by deflating the variables, but this can introduce measurement noise. With futures market

data, however, we can avoid this problem altogether by using pen. (2), with the futures price

replacing the forward price. Define a new spread 5, =
5,

where p =

F1, - (l-p)P,

i5, and substitute (2) for V',:
(8)

- r is the expected excess return on the commodity. Thus 5, is the futures-spot

-9spread, adjusted for the forecast bias in the futures price. Also, (8) implies that the futures and

spot prices are cointegrated, with cointegrating vector (I p-i)'. Hence a simple regression of

F1, on F, can be used to estimate the expected excess return, p. If real expected returns are
constant, the expected excess return should likewise be constant, and can be estimated from this

regression without recourse to the CAPM or some related model of asset pricing.
Eqn. (4) can also be written in terms of 5,, and then becomes:

= E,AP÷,

(9)

i.e., the spread S, is an unbitased forecast of the change in the spot price. (This can also be
derived directly from eqn. (5).) Again, the current futures and spot prices must be sufficient

for the optimal prediction of future spot prices. This condition is sometimes used to test the
efficiency of future markets, but its failure need not imply that the futures market is inefficient
It could instead mean that the spot price deviates from the present value relation (1), so that the

bias between the futures price and the expected spot price differs from pt',, (9) does not hold.

Tests of the Model.

Given p. eqns. (6) and (9), with 3 replacing M51' in (6), can be used to test (1). First,

(9) implies that any variables in the information set at i-i should be uncorrelated with the

residuals of a regression of P, on S,. Hence we can run regressions of the form:
tsP, =

+

÷ E1t,,1z,,5 + e,

(10)

where the z,'s are any variables that might affect price, including commodity-specific ones such

as production and inventories, and economy-wide ones such as such as GNF growth and
inflation. We then test whether b1, b2, etc. are significantly different from zero.
This requires an estimate of p to construct S,; I first use the estimate from the regression

- ID.
of F1, on P,. and then the sample mean of p (Le., the sample mean of

- F131P,). A failure

of the test could mean that (9) does not hold, or that the estimate of p used in s is very different
4
from the true value. This second possibility can be ruled out by also running the regression:

=

a

+ a1F,_1

+ Eb;,,_1

+

+

(11)

and again testing that the b41s are zero.

Second, since 5, = MS[' eqn. (6) implies that S should Granger-cause

causality tests between S and a,

I run Changer

again, constructing 5, first using the estimate of p from the

cointegrating regression, and then using the sample mean.
Finally, as Campbell and Shiller show, eqn. (I) implies constraints on the parameters of
a vector autoregression of 5, arid Eu,b. Specifically, consider the pth-order vector autoregression:
+

=

Y 'Y2ie'4,-k

t 7n5s-a

(l2a)

'Y22k5:k

L12J2i

Note from eqn. (6) that 5 is the present discounted value of the expected future A',l's. This in

turn implies that the parameters

Yin

1, ..., p, 7221 =

must satisfy the following set of cross-equation restrictions:
- 7121, and

y = -'y, Ar = 2, ..., p.' These restrictions

provide another test of the present value model.

4mese constraints are derived as in Campbell and Shiller (1987) as follows. Define; =

column vector whose p+ 1st element is I and whose remaining elements are 0, and let h be a
column vector whose first element is 1 and whose remaining elements are 0. Then from eqn.
(6), 5, = g'x, = L7ö'h'At, = h'rlA(I - &4)'x,. This must hold for any x,, so g '(1- 6A) = h 'M,

from which the constraints follow.

The Dynamics of the Percentage Net Basis.

The tests above follow from constraints that eqa. (1) imposes on spot and futures prices.

Alternatively, one can work with the differential form 01(1) and study the components of
commodity returns. By imposing some structure on expected returns (e.g.. the CAPM), one can

constrain the ratio of the net convenience yield to price. This ratio, called the percen.tage net
basis,

is analogous to the dividend-price ratio for a stock.5 Campbell and Shiller (1989) have

derived an approximate present value relation for the log dividend-price ratio, and have shown

that it implies parameter restrictions on a vector autoregression of this ratio and the difference
between the expected return and the dividend growth rate. Because the net convenience yield

is sometimes negative, I work with a simple ratio, and derive a similar approximate present
value relation, This yields parameter constraints on a vector autoregression of the percentage
net basis and the difference between the risk-free rate and the change in convenience yield.

Specifically, write the monthly return on the commodity from the beginning of period

(to the beginning of period c+l as:
=

Let y, denote the percentage net basis, i.e., y tJP. Then we can rewrite (13) as:

Then (15) can be rewritten as:

(16)

The solution to (16) is a present value relation for the normalized percentage net basis y:

-

(17)

f-a

i.e., the normalized percentage net basis is approximately the present value of the future stream

of retums from holding the commodity net of changes in the normalized convenience yield.

This is simply an approximate accounting relationship, but as Campbell and Shiller
(1989) have shown, it can be combined with an economic model for expected returns. I will
assume that the expected return is the sum of the (time-varying) expected risk-free rate plus the

(constant) risk premium p: Eq41 = E,r41 + p. Then (17) becomes:

Eqn. (18) provides another description of a commodity's price in terms of fundamentals.

It says that in an equilibrium where r, is constant and EA+J = 0 for all j, the expected return

on a commodity (p = r + p) equals the percentage net basis y,. (Note that if r1

5For most commodities, 51 is 1 percent or less, so $ is less than but close to 1. Campbell
and Shiller (1989) obtain a present value relation for the log dividend-price ratio on a stock by
first writing a log-linear approximation to the stock's log gross return, and then assuming that
the tatio of the stock price to the sum of price plus dividend is constant. That ratio (which they
denote by p) is analogous to $ in my model. I work with the arithmetic ratio of convenience
yield to price, so the only approximation required is that q; be linearized around and 51.

follows from eqns. (4) and (6)). Hence unless the discount rate is expected to change,

expected price changes are always due to expected changes in convenience yield.

Eqn. (18) imposes restrictions on the dynamics of the percentage net basis. Define *

way, as the restrictions on the VAR of eqns (l2a) and (12b), and can be used to test (18).
3, The Behavior of Spot and Futures Prices,
In this section I discuss the data set and the calculation of the one-month convenience

yield r I also discuss the behavior of spot and futures prices, v',,

and the spread 5, for the four

commodities, and present estimates of the expected excess return p and expected total return .

pA
All of the tests use futures price data for the first Wednesday of each month. In all
cases, that day's settlement price is obtained from the Wall Street Journal. Occasionally a
contract price will be constrained by exchange-imposed limits on daily price moves. In those
cases I use prices for the preceding Tuesday. If those prices are likewise constrained by limits,

use prices for the following Thursday, or if those are constrained, the preceding Monday.
To obtain a spot price P, whenever possible I use the price on the spot futures contract,

i.e., the contract expiring in month t. Thus the spot and futures prices pertain to exactly the

- 14
same

-

good, arid the time interval between the two delivery dates is luown.7 However, a spot

contract does not trade in every month for every commodity. For months when a spot contract

does not trade, I inferred a spot price from the nearest active futures contract (i.e., the active
contract next to expire, typically a month or two ahead), and the next-to-nearest active contract.

This is done by extrapolating the spread between these contracts backwards to the spot month:
(19)

F, = F11(F11/F21Y""

where F1, and F21 are the prices on the nearest and next-to-nearest futures contracts, and n,1 and
n11 are, respectivety, the number of days between t and

the expiration of the nearest contract,

and between the nearest and next-to-nearest contract.

This provides spot prices for every month of the year, but errors can arise if

the term

structure of spreads is very nontinear. To cheek that such errors are smalt, I calcutated spot
prices using (19) and compared them to actual spot contract prices for copper (available for 200

out of 223 observations), for lumber (114 out of 226 observations), and for gold (173 out of 194
observations). In all three cases,

I found little discrepancy

between the two series.'

Given a series for F,, I then calculate the one-month net marginal convenience yield, v',,

using the nearest futures contract and the Treasury bill rate that applies to the same day for

7Atternatively, one coutd use data on cash prices, purportedly reflecting actual transactions

over the month. But this results in an average price over the month, not a beginning-of-month
price. A second and more serious problem is that a cash price can apply to a different grade
or specification of the commodity (e.g., copper or gold of a different pority), and can include
discounts and premiums that result from longstanding relationships between buyers and sellers.

ime RMS percent error and mean percent error for the three series are, respectively, 1.21%
and -0.12% for copper, 3.99% and 0.39% for lumber, and 3.40% and 0.12% for gold. The
simple correlations are .998 for copper, .983 for lumber, and .999 for gold. No spot contract
prices were available for heating oil.

- 15 which the futures prices are measured. In some cases the nearest futures contract has an horizon

greater than one month; I then infer a one-month futures price using the spot contract and the
nearest contract if the spot contract exists, or else using the nearest and next-to-nearest contracts.

(For example, if in January the nearest futures prices are for March and May and there is no

January spot contract, I infer a February price using eqn. (19) with n = 28 and n12 = 61.)
To test the sufficiency of F, and F, in forecasting F,÷1, I use the following set of variables

in the vector a,: the change in the exchange value of the dollar against len other currencies, and
the growth rates of the Index of Industrial Production, the Index of Industrial Commodity Prices,

and the S&1' 500 Index. For copper, heating oil, and lumber, a, also includes the tevel and
change of monthly U.S. production and inventories of that commodity. All of these variables
are measured at the end of the month preceding the date for which prices are measured.
Prices and Convenience Yields.

Figures 1 to 4 show spot prices and the percentage net basis for each commodity. Note

that for copper, heating oil, and lumber, price and convenience yield tend to move together.
For example, copper prices rose sharply in 1973, 1979-80, and late 1987 to 1989; each time
convenience yield also rose sharply, even as a percentage of price. The same was true when
lumber prices rose in early 1973, 1977-79, 1983, and 1986-87. For heating oil the comovement

is smaller (and much of it is seasonal), but the percentage net basis still tends to move with

price. This suggests that these high prices were expected to be temporary, i.e., price (and
convenience yield) would fall as supply and demand adjust towards long-run equilibrium levels.

These figures also show that for these three commodities, convenience yield is a
quantitatively important part of the commodity's return. There were periods, for example, when

- 16 the monthly net convenience yield was 5 to 10 percent of price. Hence firms were paying 5 to
10 percent per month - plus interest and direct storage costs - to maintain stocks.

Gold is quite different. Monthly net convenience yield has always been less than 1
percent of price, and usually less than 0.2 percent. Moreover, except for the brief spike in
convenience yield in 1981, there is little comovement with price. This suggests that sharp
increases in price (as in 1980 and 1982-1983) were expected to persist. This is consistent with

the view that the price of gold follows a speculative bubble, or alternatively that it is based on
fundamentals and rose because of an expectation that convenience yield would rise in the future.

Table 1 shows results of unit root tests for spot and futures prices, convenience yield,
and the spreads S, and S. (These tests include At,.1 and &,. on the right-hand side, but no time
trend; significance levels are the same with a time trend, or with one or three lags of Ar,.) Spot

and futures prices are integrated of order 1 for alt four commodities, and at least for copper,
heating oil, and lumber, are clearly cointegrated. The table also shows estimates of the expected

monthly excess return, p, from the cointegrating regression of F1, on F, and the sample means

of p. These estimates of p are close to the sample means for heating oil and gold, and imply

expected annual excess returns of 11 percent for heating oil, and -12 percent for gold.
However, the estimates are unreasonably large for copper and lumber. Also, except for gold,
5, is stationary when calculated using either value of p. (For gold, we reject a unit root at the
5 percent level when S, is calculated using the estimate of p from the cointegrating regression,

but not when using the sample mean of p.) These results are consistent with the cointegration
of the futures and spot prices, with cointegrating vector (1

p-l)'.

On the other hand, we strongly reject a unit root in ', for all four commodities, and a

- 17extremely large estimates of the expected total return z. Also,
regression of P, onyields
,

when S is computed using the estimated value of z, we fail to reject a unit root for two
commodities, and reject at only 5 percent for the other two.) Although this is inconsistent with
the present value relation of eqn. (1), it may reflect problems of sample size, and are similar to
results obtained by Campbell and Shiller (1987) for interest rates and the stock market. Note
that when S is computed using the sample mean of ji, we reject a unit root at the 1 percent level

for every commodity but gold. It is likely that either P, is in fact mean-reverting but the mean
reversion is too slow to be detected in samples spanning less than 20 years, or alternatively that

both F, and fr, are integrated of order 1. (Agbeyegbe (1991) studies prices of pig iron, copper,
lead, and zinc using data for 1871-1973, and in each case finds strong evidence of a unit root.)

4. Test Results.
Tests of the present value relation (1) are based on eqn. (9), which implies that .S, and
F, are sufficient to forecast P÷1, on eqn. (6), which implies that 5 should Granger-cause A#,,

and on the cross-equation restrictions on the VAR of eqns. (l2a) and (l2b). The second and
third of these tests require a stiles for the futures-spot spread, $,.

I calculate St first using

estimated from the cointegrating regression, and then using the sample mean
Table 2 shows F-statistics for Wald tests of the restrictions b4 = 0 in eqns. (10) and (11).

Theserestrictions are never rejected for copper, heating oil, and gold. However, with lumber
they. are rejected at the 1 percent level both for eqn. (11) and for eqn. (10) when 5 is calculated

using the sample mean of p. This result for lumber could reflect a failure of eqn. (1), or else

inefficiency in the futures market. (The latter is more plausible for lumber than the other
commodities because lumber futures are more thinly traded.) The table also shows F-statistics

Criterion for the number of lags was inconclusive; the AIC (and FPE) suggest between 2 and

8 lags, but are fairly flat within this range. Hence I report results for 2, 4, 6, and 8 lags.
For copper, heating oil, and lumber these results are consistent with the present value

model; in each case we can clearly reject the hypothesis that 5, does not cause l,.
Furthermore, for heating oil arid lumber, the causality is unidirectional; we fall to reject the
noncausality of à4', to S. For gold, the results are more ambiguous. We reject the hypothesis

that 5, does not cause z,

with

4, 6, or 8 lags, but not with 2 lags. Also, with any number of

lags there is always a much stronger rejection of the hypothesis that

does

not cause S.

Table 3 also shows chi-square statistics for Wald tests of the cross-equation restrictions
implied by eqn. (1) on the vector autoregression of 5, and A4,. (The results shown are for a 4th-

order VAR, but are qualitatively the same for 2nd-order and 6th-order VAR5.) These
restrictions are strongly rejected for copper, lumber, and gold, irrespective of whether or p
is

used to calculate 5,. The restrictions are accepted, however, for heating oil.
These results provide mixed evidence on the ability of the present value model to explain

- 19 commodity prices. The model fits the data well for heating oil. In fact, as Figures 5 and 6

show, the unrestricted VAR of eqns. (12a) and (12b) predicts monthly changes in convenience

yield,

and the spread, S1, reasonably well. Some of the model's implications, however, are

rejected by the data for copper and lumber. This may be because on average, convenience yield

is a larger percentage of price for heating oil than for the other commodities. Hence price

movements for heating oil will be tied more closely to expected near-term changes in
convenience yield: rather than changes that might occur in the more distant future.
The strongest rejections are for gold; it is not even clear that futures and spot prices are
cointegrated, and there is no evidence that the spot price and convenience yield are cointegrated.

But if the present value model holds for gold, investors must believe that there is always a small

probability that convenience yield will rise sharpty. Throughout the 15 year sample, gold's
convenience yield has been very small relative to price, so the present value model can only
explain price movements in terms of changing market perceptions of either the mean arrival rate

of an event, or the probability distribution for its size. Since such changes in perceptions are
unobservable and do not affect current convenience yields, these results are not surprising.
Table 4 shows statistics for the percentage net basis, Yt = 11/P1, and the variable ., =

-

+ p. Note that 5;

is

largest for heating oil (about 1,5 percent per month), and

oxtremely small for gold. Also, we can clearly reject a unit root for both y1 and 4,. The table
also shows chi-square statistics for Wald tests of the cross-equation restrictions imposed by the

present value relation (18) on the 4th-order VAR of y = yjy

and .

(Again, results are

qualitatively the same for 2nd- and 6th-order VAR5.) These restrictions are strongly rejected
for all four commodities. This is not a rejection of eqn. (1), but is troubling because it can be

- 20 viewed as a rejection of a constant risk premium (recall that (18) was derived by assuming that

the expected return E,q,÷1 =

Ej, + p), and (1) includes a constant discount rate. Alternatively,

this result could be a rejection of the linear approximation of eqn. (15) used to denve (18).

5. Serial Correlation of Excess Returns.
Given these results, I examine the serial correlation of excess returns as an alternative

test of market efficiency. Apart from systematic changes in the risk premium, significant

correlation of returns would suggest temporary deviations of prices from fundamentals.
Although these tests have low statistical power, they are useful because we can look for patterns

of results across commodities that are similar to the results above for the present value model.

Cutler, Poterba, and Summers (1991) found serial correlation of excess returns that is
positive in the short run and negative in the long run for a broad range of assets that included
gold, silver, and an index of industrial metals. However, they ignored convenience yield when
measuring returns, which can lead to measurement errors. I calculate autocorrelations for excess

returns that include convenience yields, and are measured relative to the three-month Treasury
bill rate. Besides examining individual autocorrelations, I follow Cutler, Poterba, and Summers

and also examine the averages of autocorrelations 1 - 12, 13 - 24, 25 - 36, and 37 - 48. As
they point out, with limited samples individual autocorrelations may be difficult to distinguish
from zero, and persistent deviations may yield stronger evidence of serial dependence.

Autocorrelations of excess returns are shown in Table 5. (They are corrected for small

sample bias by adding t/(T-j) to thejth correlation, where Tis the sample size.) Also shown
are Box-Pierce Q statistics that test the significance of the first K autocorrelations. Observe that

we can reject a non-zero first-order autocorrelation at the 5 percent level for copper and gold.

-21Of the first 12 autocorrelations, 2 are significantly different from zero at the 5 percent level for

copper, four are for lumber, and five are for gold. Gold exhibits the greatest serial dependence

4

of returns; in addition to individual autocorrelations that are high, the Q

statistics are significant

at below the 0.1 percent level for the first 12, 24, and 48 autocorrelations.9 For copper and
lumber, there is weaker evidence of serial dependence. Fewer individual autocorrelations are

significant (especially for copper), and the Q statistics are significant for the first 12 or 24

autocorrelations, but not the first 48. Also, for all three of these commodities the serial
dependence is positive for short horizons, but negative for longer horizons. This is similar to
the patterns observed by Fama and French (l988a) for stock returns, and is consistent with the
notion that prices temporarily drift away from fundamentals.

For heating oil, however, there is no serial dependence of returns. Every individual
autocorrelation is within one standard deviation of zero, and the probability levels for the three

reported Q statistics are all above .9. This pattern across commodities parallels that in the
previous section for tests of the present value model; the strongest rejections were for gold,
results for copper and lumber were mixed, but heating oil closely conformed to the model.

6. Conclusions.
The present value model of rational commodity pricing can be viewed as a highly reduced

form of a dynamic supply and demand model, and when the commodity is traded on a futures

market, it can be tested through the constraints it imposes on the joint dynamics of spot and
futures prices. I found a close conformance to the model for heating oil, but not for copper or

i find much greater serial dependence in excess returns for gold than do Cutler, Poterba,
and Summers. Their estimate of p, for example, is only .020. However, their sample period
is 1914 to 1988, while mine is 1975 through the first three months of 1990.

- 22 lumber, and especially not for gold. The pattern is the same when one looks at the serial

dependence of excess returns. For three of the four commodities, these results are consistent
with the notion that prices temporarily drift away from fundamentals, perhaps because of "fads."
Earlier studies provide different evidence that commodity prices are not always based on

fundamentals. For example, Roll (1984) found that only a small fraction the price movements

fur frozen orange juice cart be expained by "fundamentals," i.e., by variables such as the
weather that in principle should explain a good deal of the variation in price. And Pindyck and
Rotemberg (l990a) found high levels of unexplained price correlation across commodities that

is also inconsistent with prices following fundamentals. However, both the Roil and Pindyck
and Rotemberg results may be suspect because of the possibility that one or more key variables

(that affect orange juice supply or demand, nr supplies or demands for a broad range of
commodities) have been omitted. The present value model, on the other hand, is based entirely

on a payoff stream that can be measured from futures market data. The rejections of some of
the implications of that model (together with the finding of serially dependent returns) provides

additional evidence that the prices of some commodities may be partly driven by fads.
Heating oil prices, however, conform closely to the present value model, and there is no

evidence of serial dependence in excess returns. Why does heating oil seem to differ from the

other commodities in this respect? It may be that its high average convenience yield makes
speculation too costiy. A speculative long position in heating oil costs 1½ percent per month
on average in convenience yield; the odds are more favorable for other commodities.
