Forecasting China's Economic Growth and Inflation

JEL No. C53,E1,E17
ABSTRACT
Although macroeconomic forecasting forms an integral part of the policymaking process, there
has been a serious lack of rigorous and systematic research in the evaluation of out-of-sample
model-based forecasts of China's real GDP growth and CPI inflation. This paper fills this
research gap by providing a replicable forecasting model that beats a host of other competing
models when measured by root mean square errors, especially over long-run forecast horizons.
The model is shown to be capable of predicting turning points and to be usable for policy analysis
under different scenarios. It predicts that China's future GDP growth will be of L-shape rather
than U-shape.

FORECASTING CHINA’S ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INFLATION

1

I. Introduction
China’s growth and cyclical fluctuations, especially since the 2008 financial crisis, have
largely depended on China’s macroeconomic policies. In particular, the government’s policies
for promoting investment in heavy industries such as real estate and infrastructure constitute
a driving force behind both growth and cyclical fluctuations for the past two decades (Chang,
Chen, Waggoner, and Zha, 2015). The question of where China’s economic growth will be
headed in the future (in the Chinese government’s language, a L-shape or U-shape growth
pattern) has been a hotly contested issue for policymakers and researchers alike.
As China has become the second largest economy in the world, rigorous and systematic
research in the evaluation of out-of-sample forecasts of China’s macroeconomy is urgently
needed.1 For the Federal Reserve System and a number of central banks in other developed
countries, macroeconomic forecasting is an integral part of the policymaking process. In this
context, monthly macroeconomic time series are very important for timely policy projections.
In this paper, we extend the Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR) methodology to
forecasting China’s macroeconomy, especially gross domestic product (GDP) growth and
consumer price index (CPI) inflation (the two variables exclusively considered by many
central banks around the world when taking policy actions). Our proposed benchmark
model outperforms a host of other alternatives, including the gold-standard random walk
model and other forecasting models studied in the recent literature. The model is close to
the one used to provide forecasts for the People’s Bank of China and the macro forecasting
team at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. Our methodology enables one to
generate density forecasts in addition to point forecasts. In this paper, we use .68 probability
bands as the most commonly used device for communicating density forecasts.
Replicable forecasting models like our benchmark model built in this paper are needed
because their forecast performance can be evaluated in a scientific manner on a continual
basis. Some models, such as China’s Annual Macroeconomic Model developed jointly by the
Chinese Academy of Social Science and the National Bureau of Statistics of China (CASSNBS) and China’s Quarterly Macroeconomic Model developed by Xiamen University in
2006 (CQMM), do not have complete information about model structures for independent
evaluation. In this paper, we focus on a host of competing models that can be replicated
and thus evaluated independently. One exception is the widely used monthly surveys of Blue
Chip Economic Indicators (BCEI). Although the BCEI does not have replicable models, it
provides a complete set of forecast records that can be used for comparison of forecast
accuracy.

According to the root mean square error (RMSE) criterion, our benchmark model performs
remarkably well over the long-run forecast horizon (three and four years ahead). Given the
long lag of monetary policy, the long-run forecasting performance is particularly critical for
policy analysis. We find that the model is also capable of predicting the turning point for
GDP growth and CPI inflation, a task that is challenging for any macroeconomic model. We
consider different policy scenarios to show that M2 growth, a tool utilized by the People’s
Bank of China in conducting its monetary policy, has proven to be very effective in predicting
GDP growth in both short and long runs.
For the U.S. economy, forecasting inflation from replicable models is a top priority for
policymakers and academic researchers (Stock and Watson, 2007). For China, forecasting
GDP growth from replicable models is the most important factor for policy analysis as well as
in an analysis of China’s impact on the world economy. But model-based forecasts of China’s
GDP growth have proven to a challenging task. In this paper we demonstrate that while our
proposed benchmark model is competitive with other models in predicting CPI inflation, it is
this model’s superior performance in predicting GDP growth rates that warrants particular
attention.
The rest of paper is structured as follows. Section II reviews the methodology for the
benchmark model and the related literature on forecasting models. Section III describes
the monthly data used in this paper. Section IV compares the forecast accuracy of our
benchmark model to the competing models and explore the role of monetary policy using
conditional forecasts. Section V uses our benchmark model to forecast future GDP growth
to shed light on recent policy debates on whether economic growth in the future will be of
L-shape versus U-shape. Section VI concludes the paper.
II. Methodology and the literature review
In this section we review the methodology of our benchmark model and then discuss other
methods in the context of the literature. A brief description of this methodology, targeted
for our own applications, is self-contained so that the reader does not need to read through
the multiple original papers.
II.1. The benchmark model. Our benchmark model is a Bayesian vector autoregression
(BVAR) based on Waggoner and Zha (1999) with the Sims-Zha prior (Sims and Zha, 1998).
It has the following VAR form:
p
X

0
yt−l
Al = d0 + 0t , for t = 1, ..., T,

(1)

l=0

where yt is an n × 1 vector of endogenous variables for period t, T the sample size, Al the
n × n coefficient matrix for the lth lag of the VAR, p the number of lags, d an n × 1 vector

FORECASTING CHINA’S ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INFLATION

of constant terms, and t an n × 1 vector of i.i.d. structural shocks satisfying:
E(t |yt−s , s > 0) = 0 and E(t 0t | yt−s , s > 0) = In .
In this paper, since we focus on forecasting, we follow the convention of Sims (1980) and
Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (1999) and make the contemporaneous coefficient matrix
A0 triangular. The order of the variables, however, is inconsequential for our forecasting
exercises. The reduced form of (1) is:

or
y = (In ⊗ X)b + e, e ∼ N (0, Σ ⊗ IT ) ,

where N (·, ·) represents a normal probability distribution.
We implement the Sims-Zha prior for the reduced-form (3) as

f (·, ·) denotes a tractable distribution similar but not equal to the Wishart distriwhere W
bution.2 The prior vector b̄ = vec([In , 00n×(n(p−1)+1) ]0 ) to reflect beliefs that each variable
follows a random walk. The prior hyperparameter matrix S̄ is an n × n diagonal matrix
diag(σ1 , σ2 , ..., σn ), where σi is set to the standard deviation of the residuals from estimating
a univariate AR(p) fit by ordinary least squares to the time series of ith variable. The hyperparameters λ0 , λ1 , λ3 , and λ4 determine the prior diagonal covariance matrix Ψ̄. For each of
n2 p combinations of variable i, equation j, and lag length l (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ p),

2
λ0 λ1 /(σj lλ3 ) is the prior variance appearing at position (i − 1)[np + 1] + (l − 1)n + j on
the diagonal of Ψ̄. The term appearing at position i[np + 1] on the diagonal of Ψ̄, for each i
with 1 ≤ i ≤ n, is [λ0 λ4 ]2 (the prior variance on the constant term).
The most important part of the Sims-Zha prior consists of two sets of dummy observations
from the data to capture prior beliefs about unit roots (not just random walk) and cointegration in the time series. We call this component of the prior “the cointegration prior,”
which is paramountly important because many of the Chinese time series tend to be highly

cointegrated. The unit-root prior is mathematically expressed as the following n dummy
observations
Yur = µ5 diag(ȳ) and Xur = µ5 [11×n ⊗ diag(ȳ), 0n×1 ] ,
P
where the subscript “ur” stands for unit root, ȳ = p1 0t=−(p−1) yt is the average of the initial
p observations, and µ5 a prior hyperparameter. As µ5 → ∞, the prior implies a unit root
in each equation with no cointegration. The cointegration prior is implemented with one
dummy observation:
Yco = µ6 ȳ and Xco = µ6 [11×n ⊗ ȳ, 1] ,
where the subscript “co” stands for cointegration and µ6 is a hyperparameter. As µ6 → ∞,
the prior implies that the variables have up to n−1 cointegration relationships but allows for

a single or multiple stochastic trends. Define X∗ = [X0 , Xur

Posterior estimation is based on Y∗ and X∗ (not Y and X).
Li (2016) applies the Sims-Zha prior to a large set of China’s quarterly time series and find
that a decay value of λ4 as large as 5 is the key to achieving robust results of accurate outof-sample forecasts of GDP growth and CPI inflation. By combining Li (2016)’s new finding
for China with the standard Sims-Zha prior for the monthly U.S. economy documented by
Zha (1998), we propose the following values of hyperparameters for our monthly benchmark
model: λ0 = 0.57, λ1 = 0.13, λ3 = 0.1, λ4 = 5.0, and µ5 = µ6 = 10.

The last term in (4) gives the cumulative impact of future structural shocks on endogenous

By collecting the future structural shocks from T +1 to T +h in the vector  = 0T +1 0T +2 . . . 0T +h ,
one can see from equation (4) that imposing the condition y ∗ on the future forecasts is equivalent to imposing the following condition on the structural shocks
R0  = r.
Now suppose we wish to impose only a subset of y ∗ . We first determine the row numbers
of y ∗ associated with the restricted subset and then remove these rows from r and R0 . We
use what is left to create r̃ and R̃0 . Thus, imposing a subset of restrictions is equivalent to
imposing the condition
R̃0  = r̃.

(5)

Waggoner and Zha (1999) show that maximum likelihood estimate of  subject to restriction
(5) is M LE = R̃(R̃0 R̃)−1 r̃. These shocks are fed into (4) to generate the desired conditional
forecasts.
II.3. Other models in the literature. It is known that BVAR forecasts are more accurate than VAR forecasts (Doan, Litterman, and Sims, 1984). While the literature on the
BVAR methodology is voluminous, Robertson and Tallman (2001) and Carriero, Clark, and
Marcellino (2015) discuss it in great details (see other references therein). BVAR models
provide an important tool that has long been used by central banks around the world for
macroeconomic analysis. There are several variations of BVAR modeling. The most popular
one is the BVAR with the Minnesota prior introduced by (Litterman, 1986), whose model
generated out-of-sample forecasts as accurate as those used by the best known commercial
forecasting services. The Minnesota prior is a special case of the Sims-Zha prior without the
unit-root and cointegration prior components.
Bańbura, Giannone, and Reichlin (2010) modify the Minnesota prior for relatively large
BVAR models and propose a procedure to adjust a key value of the “overall tightness” hyperparameter as the number of variables increases. The prior proposed by Bańbura, Giannone,

FORECASTING CHINA’S ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INFLATION

6

and Reichlin (2010) is further modified by Giannone, Lenza, and Primiceri (2015), who implement a more systematic approach by choosing a very diffuse prior for the hyperparameters—
called hyperpriors—and solving for the posterior mode of these hyperparameter values. Furthermore, they incorporate the Sims-Zha dummy observations for co-integration in their
prior. With this systematic procedure, Giannone, Lenza, and Primiceri (2015) find that
their 22-variable BVAR model has forecast accuracy comparable to their 3-variable and 8variable BVARs.3 We will use the prior proposed by Giannone, Lenza, and Primiceri (2015)
(called the GLP model), which is the most recent prior proposed in the literature, to compare
forecast accuracy to our benchmark model.
Popular alternative models in the forecasting literature include autoregressive (AR) models
for each variable and the random walk model of Atkeson and Ohanian (2001) for each
variable. For the ith variable, the various AR specifications studied in this paper are
yti

where p = 1, 6, 12, xt is univariate, and β = 0 whenever a trend is not used. The random
walk model is often treated as the gold standard for out-of-sample forecasting. Following
Atkeson and Ohanian (2001), we recursively calculate the random walk forecast for the ith
variable in one month ahead as4

(6)

When t ≤ T where T is the date prior to the forecast period, ŷti = yti .
II.4. Annual changes according to calendar year. Following the convention of reporting comparable forecasts established by the BCEI, we calculate the annual rate as the ratio of
the average value in the forecast year to the average value in the previous year. This reporting method applies to GDP growth, CPI inflation, M2 growth, and other growth variables,
except interest rates and variables that are already expressed in percent. To be consistent
3Specifically,

the 22-variable BVAR’s one year ahead forecast of GDP growth is less accurate than the

smaller BVARs, but the one year ahead inflation forecast is more accurate.

(see equation (4) of their paper), where pT denotes the monthly price level

at the end of the sample T . To implement Atkeson and Ohanian (2001)’s model, we would use the model
T −12
ŷt+1 = ŷt + yT −y
for t > T . It turns out that the RMSEs produced by this method are larger than those
12

from our modified random walk model (6) except for the two years ahead forecast of CPI inflation, although
the differences are very small. Other adapted random walk models include Stock and Watson (2007) and
Ang, Bekaert, and Wei (2007).

with calendar years, the time subscript t can be alternatively expressed by double indices as
t = {yr, mon}, where yr represents calendar year and mon represents calendar month. An

III. Data
Our monthly dataset is based on Chang, Chen, Waggoner, and Zha (2015) and Higgins
and Zha (2015), who construct a standard set of quarterly macroeconomic time series comparable to those commonly used in the macroeconomic literature on Western economies.
The construction process is based on China’s official macroeconomic data series compiled in
the CEIC’s China Premium Database.
One may question the quality of China’s official macroeconomic data, especially the GDP
series. Despite the unsettled debates on this issue, our view is that one should not abandon the official series of GDP in favor of other less comprehensive series such as electricity
consumption or electricity production, no matter how “reliable” one would claim those alternatives are in gauging the pulse of China’s overall economy. After all, the series of GDP
is what financial markets, researchers, policy analysts, and policymakers would pay most
attention to when China’s aggregate activity is assessed. In a very recent paper, Nie (2016)
forcibly argues that “official GDP figures remain a useful and valid measure of Chinese
economic growth.”
The sample for estimation is from 2000M1 to the date prior to forecast (starting 2010M12
and rolling forward to 2015M11 month by month). The variables are interpolated real valueadded GDP, real retail sales of consumer goods (consumption), real fixed-asset investment
(investment), M2, CPI, net exports (as percent of GDP), the 7-day repo rate in the national
interbank market (repo), and the one year benchmark deposit rate (the deposit rate). Real
consumption and real investment are deflated by the CPI. We have also deflated consumption
by its own price index for retail sales of consumer goods and investment by the interpolated
GDP deflator.5 We construct the non-seasonally adjusted M2 times series based on the nonseasonally adjusted level of M2 for the period of 2015M1 to 2015M12 and the year-over-year
5Fixed-asset

investment has its own price index but a release of this price index is often one or two years

after the release of nominal fixed-asset investment series.

FORECASTING CHINA’S ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INFLATION

8

growth rates from the PBC. This constructed series alleviates serious problems of sudden
changes or misalignments of statistical coverage for certain periods of the sample. We then
adjusted this series seasonally.
We interpolate the quarterly seasonally adjusted GDP deflator series with monthly seasonally adjusted producer price index, CPI, retail goods price index, and M2 and the quarterly
seasonally adjusted nominal GDP series with monthly seasonally adjusted nominal consumption, exports, imports, and industrial value added. The method for interpolating real
GDP follows closely Chow and Lin (1971), Leeper, Sims, and Zha (1996), and Bernanke,
Gertler, and Watson (1997). Quarterly seasonally adjusted nominal GDP and its deflator
are constructed by Higgins and Zha (2015).
All variables are entered in log except for net exports and the two interest rates, which are
entered as percentages (divided by 100). All the log variables bar investment are seasonally
adjusted using X13-ARIMA-SEATS modified to take into consideration the effect of China’s
Spring Festival holidays. The Spring Festival has a substantial impact on monthly economic
activity; it falls sometimes in January, sometimes in February, and sometimes crosses both.
As for the monthly investment series, there are three more challenges for seasonal adjustment.
First, the published value of investment is aggregated across January and February. Second,
the value for December is significantly higher than those for other months even after seasonal
adjustment. Third, there is a level-shift in the series during the year of 2004. We use the
method by Fernald, Spiegel, and Swanson (2014) to disaggregate one January-February
observation into two observations in separate months and use the approach proposed by
Wright (2013) to seasonally adjust the resulting series. Figure 1 plots the investment series
before and after our adjustment. Evidently, the adjustment removes the seasonality and
level-shift.
IV. Assessing forecast performance
Models usable for day-to-day policy analysis must be able to forecast the economy well.
The most important variables concerning policymakers are GDP growth and CPI inflation.6
Providing accurate forecasts of these two variables has proven to be an extremely challenging
task. We show that our benchmark model performs remarkably well in comparison with a
host of competing models studied in the literature and in most cases outperform them, as
reported in Tables 1-4.
6The

two variables, output growth and inflation, are universally used by central banks around the world to

guide their policy actions. In particular, the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) regularly released in
the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes by the Federal Reserve Board reports projections of
these variables in addition to the unemployment rate and the federal funds rate under appropriate monetary
policy.

FORECASTING CHINA’S ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INFLATION

9

In addition to the benchmark model and the BCEI forecasts, we consider 11 competing
models: (i) the standard VAR model (with no proper prior) estimated by ordinary least
squares, (ii) the widely used BVAR model with the Minnesota prior, (iii) the GLP BVAR
model, (iv) the gold-standard random walk model, and (v) six univariate AR models, that
is, AR(1), AR(6), and AR(12) models with and without trend.
IV.1. Out-of-sample forecasting. Out-of-sample forecasts reported in Tables 1-4 are annual growth rates of real GDP and annual inflation rates of CPI. Except the BCEI forecasts,
all the models listed in these tables use the sample starting from 2000M1 until the date
when actual out-of-sample forecasts are made.7 The starting sample date accords with the
earliest date back to which China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) periodically revises
its time series. The forecast year ranges from one year ahead (short run) to four years ahead
(long run). Long-run forecasts have proven to be a difficult and oftentimes embarrassing
exercise. For this and other reasons, the BCEI provides out-of-sample forecasts only over
the two years horizon and we report the average of the BCEI forecasts.8 For policymakers,
however, long-run out-of-sample forecasts are essential because monetary policy is known to
have long and lagged effects on the real economy (Sims and Zha, 2006).
The forecast evaluation period is from 2011 to 2015. Since data are monthly and forecasts
are updated each month, this five-year period gives us enough data points to evaluate out-ofsample forecast performance without disproportionately shortening the length of the sample
used for accurate estimation. For this evaluation period and for each variable, we compute
the RMSE of forecasts at each forecast horizon (from one to four years ahead).
IV.2. GDP growth and CPI inflation. We first analyze forecasts from all models bar
the BCEI, which is not model-based and will be discussed later. Except for the one year
forecast horizon, the benchmark model’s RMSEs for GDP growth over the longer horizons
(two, three, and four years ahead) are considerably smaller than those produced from the
random walk and the GLP model (Table 1).9 For the one year horizon, the random walk
model perfroms better than both the GLP model and the benchmark model. The popular
7When

some data such as GDP are unavailable within the quarter, one can condition forecasts on other

series available within the quarter such as M2 and interest rates with a method described in Section II.2.
8Bauer, Eisenbeis, Waggoner, and Zha (2006) show that the average BCEI forecast tends to be more
accurate than individual forecasts.
9When we use the series of real consumption (divided by its own price deflator) and real investment
(divided by the GDP deflator), the RMSEs are similar and in many cases more accurate. For example, the
RMSEs for real GDP growth in two, three, four years ahead are respectively 0.754%, 0.744%, and 0.540%.
For the meaning of these number, for example, 0.754% means that the root mean square error is less than
1% for predicting the actual GDP growth rate over the two years horizon. Thus, the forecast accuracy for
both one and two years ahead is highly competitive with the BCEI forecast.

Minnesota-prior model fares much worse than the benchmark model, especially in forecast
horizons longer than one year ahead. All other models, including the standard VAR model
(i.e., with no proper prior) that has been widely used and all parsimonious AR models,
perform even worse over all forecast horizons.
For CPI inflation, , the GLP model’s RMSE is much smaller than that of the benchmark over the one year horizon but substantially larger over the longer horizons from two
to four years (Table 3). Compared to the benchmark, both the random walk model and
the Minnesota-prior model perform well over the one year horizon but lose their strength
considerably over the horizons of two to four years ahead. The standard VAR fares very
badly for all forecast horizons. Except for the one year horizon, all AR models have larger
RMSEs than the benchmark model.
Since the literature regards the random walk model as the gold standard for gauging the
success of other models in forecasting performance, Tables 2 and 4 report the ratio of the
RMSE for each model to the RMSE for the random walk model. If the relative RMSE
ratio for a particular model is greater than one, the model performs worse than the random
walk model. If the ratio is less than one, the model performs better. Thus, the smaller the
relative RMSE ratio, the superior the corresponding model’s performance. For CPI inflation,
in addition to the benchmark model, a number of models beat the random walk model in the
longer run (two to four years ahead), including the GLP model and many AR models (4). In
fact, both the GLP model and the benchmark model, as well as AR(6) and AR(12) models
with trend, beat the random walk model by large margins over longer forecast horizons. This
phenomenon is in sharp contrast to the findings for the U.S. economy where the random walk
model is the king for predicting inflation (Atkeson and Ohanian, 2001).
The results for GDP growth, however, present a completely different picture. All models
other than the benchmark model and the BCEI fail to beat the random walk model. But
compared to the benchmark model, the random walk model performs better only over the
one year horizon; it gives in to the benchmark model’s increasing strength in all other forecast
horizons (over two to four years ahead).
The BCEI forecasts are interesting examples. On a monthly basis, the Blue Chip surveys
15-20 respondents specifically for China. All respondents are top professional forecasters and
most of them do not strictly adhere to a replicable econometric model. For GDP growth,
their forecasts are often judgmentally chosen to be close to the target set by the Chinese
government. This strategy pays off as the BCEI forecast of GDP growth fares better than
our benchmark model as well as all other models, including the random walk model (Tables 1
and 2). But CPI inflation forecasting is a different matter. Although the Chinese government
discusses what an appropriate CPI inflation rate should be, there has never been a serious
attempt from the government to adhere to such a “target” for CPI inflation. As a result,

FORECASTING CHINA’S ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INFLATION

11

the BCEI forecast of CPI inflation by closely following the government’s rhetoric turns out
to be much worse than the forecast produced by the benchmark model (Tables 3 and 4).

IV.3. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis. In 2009 the Chinese government
injected an unprecedented four trillion RMB into the economy, which undoubtedly helped
stabilize economic growth and pushed real GDP growth over double digits in 2010. Many
economists were stunned by how fast China’s economy could turn around so swiftly (in
comparison to the U.S. economy with a long and slow recovery). Although few economists
at the end of 2010 would predict a persistently slowing economy starting in 2011, the turning
point is captured by our benchmark model.
As shown in Tables 5 and 6, the benchmark model predicts, out of sample, a persistent
decline of GDP growth similar to the actual path of GDP growth. In contrast, the GLP
model shows a U-shape pattern of GDP growth with the growth rate turning over double
digits in 2013-2015. The GLP model performs better except for 2014-2015 for CPI inflation,
but it generates the U-shape prediction of growth rates of investment and M2, a direction
opposite to the downward actual paths. The benchmark model, however, predicts paths of
investment growth and M2 growth in a downward direction similar to the actual paths.
Chang, Chen, Waggoner, and Zha (2015) argue that the government is effective in controlling bank credit via M2 growth to influence investment and therefore GDP growth. The
finding that M2 growth is a powerful policy tool in China applies to this turning point as
well. From Table 6 one can see that the benchmark model predicts a path of M2 growth
lower than the actual path. This pattern supports the under-prediction of growth rates of
investment and GDP.
Consider a policy scenario in which M2 growth follows the actual path in the forecast
period 2011-2015. Using the technique of conditional forecasts discussed in Section II.2,
we report the prediction results of investment growth, CPI inflation, and GDP growth in
Figure 2. Since the actual M2 growth path is higher than the unconditional forecast path (cf.
Table 6 and Figure 2), investment and GDP growth rates are higher than the unconditional
counterparts (cf. Tables 5-6 and Figure 2). As a result, the prediction path of GDP growth
under this policy scenario is very close to the actual path, especially over the long forecast
horizon such as three to five years ahead. From the model’s perspective, moreover, the upper
probability band of predictions does not return to double-digit growth (a level at the time
when predictions are model) for a forecast horizon after two years ahead.
In summary, the exercises in this section produce three findings: first, the benchmark
model is capable of predicting the difficult turning point when economic growth turned into
single digits after it rebounded to double digits in 2010 with the government’s unprecedented

12

expansionary monetary policy; second, the policy variable, M2 growth, proves to be a powerful driving force of GDP growth; and third, the model can be effectively used for analyzing
different policy scenarios.
V. Into the future: L-shape versus U-shape of GDP growth
Having established the benchmark model’s superior performance of out-of-sample forecasts
relative to other competing models, we now use it to predict economic growth and inflation
in the future. Such a prediction is very important because of its relevance to the current
policy debate on whether China’s GDP growth will be of U-shape or L-shape. Academic
voice represented by Professor Daokui Li at Tsinghua, former member of Monetary Policy
Committee of the People’s Bank of China, expressed a view that China’s GDP growth rate
will likely be of U-shape.10 An official opinion has added to this academic voice. The press
representative from the NBS, Laiyun Sheng, held a regular news conference on 15 April 2016
to express a similar view.11 On the other hand, People’s Daily of 9 May 2016, an official
newspaper representing the voice of the Central Communist Party, argues that future GDP
growth is likely to be of L-shape.12
Which prediction is likely to be more accurate? Given considerable disagreements within
the government itself, we use the benchmark model to shed light on this important policy
debate at a critical juncture of the Chinese economy by providing forecasts to see which shape
our prediction path is closer to. Figure 3 plots unconditional forecasts of GDP growth, CPI
inflation, and M2 growth based on the information up to 2016M3.13 The .68 probability
bands display a degree of uncertainty that reflects the historical forecast errors, with the
lower probability band of GDP growth being as low as 4.2%. But according to the most
likely path (the posterior mode path) most economists pay attention to, the model predicts
a L-shape path of GDP growth that hovers around 6.5% over the next five years while CPI
inflation is predicted to be 1.7% except for 2016 (in comparison, the BCEI forecast of GDP
growth is 6.5% for 2016 and 6.2% for 2017 and of CPI inflation is 1.9% for 2016 and 2017).
This result is in sharp contrast with the results from the GLP model, which predicts CPI

The forecasts conditional on the additional data available in May 2016 at the time when this article
was written are so similar that we do not report to conserve the space. These additional data are CPI,
consumption, investment, M2, the repo rate, and the deposit rate in April 2016; and the repo rate and the
deposit rate in May 2016.

FORECASTING CHINA’S ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INFLATION

inflation as high as 2.9% by 2019 and a robust rebound of GDP growth from 7% in 2016 to
9.4% in 2020. The GLP model’s forecast path of economic growth is certainly of U-shape.
The predicted U-shape rebound, however, is so high that one may judge it a low probability
event (as indicated by the upper probability band of GDP growth in Figure 3).
We use the benchmark model to analyze several policy scenarios. For the U.S. and other
developed countries, the impact of interest rates on the aggregate real economy has proven
to be powerful. The People’s Bank of China has been discussing the possibility of controlling
interest rates such as the repo rate as a major policy instrument. Thus, it is informative
to see how changes in future interest rates affect the Chinese economy. We consider a
policy scenario in which the repo rate or the deposit rate would be raised by 1% above
the unconditional forecasts to 3.5% for the repo rate and 2.5% for the deposit rate in from
2017 to 2020. As one can see, the impact on GDP growth and CPI inflation in comparison
to the unconditional forecasts is very limited (Tables 7 and 8).14 This finding, though not
surprising for China’s economy, is contrary to the conventional wisdom about the impact of
interest rates, a wisdom applicable to the U.S. and other developed economies.
Changes in M2 growth exert considerable impact on GDP growth as we illustrate in
Section IV. Consider a policy scenario in which M2 growth will slow down from 11.0% in
2016 and 9.5% in 2017 to 9% afterwards (in comparison to the unconditional forecast of
11.8% in 2016, 11.2% in 2017, and around 11.4% afterwards).15 CPI inflation prediction is
lower that the unconditional forecast path (Table 8). Future GDP growth is now predicted to
be 5.8% (Table 7), producing an even steeper L-shape trajectory. For our monthly dataset,
the standard deviation is 3.76% for year-over-year M2 growth, 1.01% for the repo rate, and
0.64% for the deposit rate. For our various policy scenarios, therefore, changes in M2 growth
from the unconditional forecasts are well within one standard deviation, while changes in
the repo rate are about one standard deviation and changes in the deposit rate are well
above one standard deviation. Yet, the impact of changes in M2 growth on GDP growth
is much larger than that of changes in interest rates. A slowdown in M2 growth would be
a sensible policy scenario to consider because it allows time for China to adjust from an
investment-driven economy to an economy more oriented to services and consumption.
VI. Conclusion
We provide an empirical model for China’s macroeconomy that can be replicated and
evaluated independently. We show that this model has superior forecast performance relative
14We

experiment with the lending rate instead of the deposit rate and the impact on GDP growth is even

weaker.
15All conditional forecasts, including the previous exercises with conditions on the repo rate and the
deposit rate, use the data available up to May 2016 when this paper was completed.

to other competing models. Given this performance, the model should serve as a benchmark
for comparison of forecast accuracy.
Accurate and timely macroeconomic forecasting is an essential part of the policymaking
process. Contrary to the common belief based from the robust studies on the U.S. and other
developed economies, we find that the impact of interest rates on the aggregate economy
is relatively muted while changes in M2 growth have considerably larger impact. These
findings imply that macroeconomic analysis of China should be based on these facts, not on
off-the-self models working for other economies.
China’s economy, as well as its monetary policy, has reached a stage that is mature enough
for rigorous empirical macroeconomic analysis comparable to the international standards
(Wen, 2016). In more ambitious projects for future research, for example, Markov-switching
models taking into account of regime changes and stochastic volatility and mixed-frequency
models incorporating weekly or daily financial variables would be useful tools to address
many practical and policy-related issues. We view our analysis in this paper as a first step
toward this goal.
