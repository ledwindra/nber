May 1979
Revised December 1979
High School Preparation and Early Labor Force Experience
SUMMARY

The relationship between high school training and work experience on
the one hand and early labor force experience on the other are analyzed
in the paper.

In addition, the extent and nature of the persistence of

early labor force experience is evaluated. The study is based on data
for male youths from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School

Class of 1972. While there appears to be no relationship between jobrelated training in high school and post-graduation weeks worked or
wage rates, there is a strong relationship between hours worked while
in high school and both weeks worked and wage rates in the first four

years after graduation. High school class rank and test scores also
are positively related to early weeks worked and wage rates in the labor
force.

It is also found that after controlling for individual specific

characteristics of youth, there is little relationship between weeks
worked in the first year after high school graduation and weeks worked

four years later. And there is almost no relationship between initial
wage rates and wage rates four years later, other than those attributable

to measured and unmeasured individual specific characteristics. There is
little persistence of early experience that cannot be attributed to

heterogeneity among youth. There is, however, an effect of early work
experience on later wage rates, although it is of modest magnitude in
this sample of high school graduates.

HIGH SCHOOL PREPARATION
and

EARLY LABOR FORCE EXPERIENCE

by

Robert H. Meyer and David A. Wise*

Many kinds of preparation and experience are presumed to prepare

youth to find jobs, to do them, to keep them. At least three are often

mentioned. One is general academic education --

reading,

writing,

arithmetic. A second is vocational training intended to develop the
skills necessary to perform particular tasks. A third is work experience itself, emphasized as the way to learn what it's like to work, to
acquire the habits and attitudes that persons who work have, that draw
one to want to work, and that those who hire want to find in those they

pay. Motivated by these comon hopes, we have investigated the relationships between early labor force experience and the three kinds of high

school preparation that emphasize them. The paper analyzes the relationship between high school curriculum, work experience, and academic

achievement on the one hand and early labor force employment and wage

rates on the other. We find that work experience while in high school
is strongly related to later employment. Academic performance in high
school is also related to successful labor market experience. But we
find no significant effect of current forms of high school vocational

training on early labor force experience. Thus the weight of our evidence implies that programs that emphasize work experience for youth,

together with general academic education, have the greatest chance of
enhancing their subsequent labor force experiences.
The analysis is based on male youth who graduated from high school.
A large portion of young persons enter the labor force immediately upon

graduation from high school. Many receive no further formal education.
For these youth, as well as those who continue their education, high
school preparation is a potentially important determinant of early labor

force experience. Because the study is limited to high school graduates,
its implications for high school dropouts must be indirect. Among all
groups of youth, high school dropouts, and in particular black school

dropouts, have the poorest labor force experiences. Nonetheless, labor
force statistics suggest a high youth unemployment rate, even among high

school graduates. And our results for high school graduates we think
have strong implications for future generations of persons like those
who now drop out, if these future generations were to remain in school
The Analysis is based on data collected by the National Center for
Educational Statistics through the National Longitudinal Study of 1972

High School Seniors. The Study collected a wide range of school, family
background, attitude and aspiration information from approximately 23,000

high school seniors in the Spring of 1972. The 1972 base survey was
based on a nation-wide sample of high schools, stratified in such a way
that schools in lower socioeconomic areas were somewhat oversampled.

In addition to the base survey, the Study included three follow-up

surveys in 1973, 1974, and 1976. The follow-up surveys were used to
obtain information on post-secondary school and work choices as well

as labor force experiences.1 Unlike most other data sources, this one

-3-

allows us to follow a single cohort in their transition from school to
work.

Most male youths in the years imediately after high school are
either in the labor force or are attending a post-secondary school

some are in the labor force and going to school. Because the labor
force aspirations of persons while they are students, their labor force
behavior, their access to the labor market, and thus their realized
experiences are likely to differ substantially from persons who are not
in school, we have sought to obtain estimates that represent the experi-

ence that we would expect to find among persons not in school. To obtain
such estimates, however, we must consider simultaneously both the decision to enter the labor force, rather than go to school, and the expected

experience of those who enter the labor force. In a strictly statistical
sense, this may be thought of as correcting for sample selection bias.
But in our case, the determinants of school attendance, as well as the
determinants of labor force experience, are of considerable substantive
interest.

In fact, the decision to attend school may be expected to be

determined in part by expected labor force experience. Although our
primary emphasis will be on labor force experience we will give some

attention to the determinants of school attendance as well. The
outline of the paper is preceded by a sumary of our major findings.
We have found a strong relationship between hours of work while in

high school and weeks worked per year upon graduation. Persons who work
while in high school also receive higher hourly wage rates than those

who don't. The combined effect on earnings is very substantial. For
example, with other individual characteristics equal to the average in
the sample, persons who worked 16 to 20 hours per week in high school

-4-

are estimated to earn annually about 12 percent more than those who

didn't work at all in high school. Depending upon the amount of work
in high school and estimated weeks worked based on other characteristics, the estimated "effect" on annual earnings of high school work

could be as high as 30 or 35 percent. On the other hand, we find
almost no relationship between any measure of high school vocational

training and later weeks worked or wage rates. This has led us to
raise the possibility that programs that emphasize work experience in
high school may well have a greater impact on later labor market
experience than programs that emphasize job skill training without

work experience. Our evidence, however, establishes only a strong
correspondence between work while in high school and later employment;
it cannot be used to infer a cause and effect relationship of the
same magnitude.

Traditional measures of academic achievement are also positively

related to early success in the labor market. In particular, class rank
is related to both weeks worked after graduation and to wage rates, after
controlling for test scores reflecting a combination of aptitude and achieve-

ment. Combined with the results on hours worked in high school

,

this

implies to us a substantial carry-over to the labor market of individual
attributes associated with or developed through work effort in and out

of school. Class rank may also measure general academic knowledge. And
together with the positive estimated effect of test scores on both weeks
worked and wage rates implies a significant effect of traditional measures of academic aptitude and achievement on labor market performance
upon leaving school .

Thus both high school academic performance and work

-5-

experience seem to dominate specific vocational training as preparation
for successful early experience in the labor market.

In contrast to the lasting relationship between high school work
experience on weeks worked and wage rates over the next four years,
there is little relationship between random -- as distinct from individual specific --

determinants of weeks worked in the first year after

graduation and weeks worked four years later, and little relationship
between random determinants of wage rates upon graduation and wage rates

four years later. After controlling for individual specific characteristics, we find little lasting effect of unusually few weeks worked in the

first year or two on weeks worked three or four years later. Similarly,
after controlling for individual specific terms, we find little lasting
effect of random fluctuations in initial wage rates on wages four years

later. Whatever the determinants of wages and weeks worked, other than
individual specific attributes, they do not lead to long-run persistence
of initial experience.

(On the other hand, wage rates increase with job

experience so that weeks not working contribute to lower wage rates in

the future.) And much if not most of work while in high school, that has a
substantial positive relation to later labor market experience, must
have been on jobs with limited direct relation to future job ladders,
although our data do not provide any indication of the quality of high

school jobs. Thus our findings suggest that the oft-expressed worry
that poor initial jobs and initial jobs without a future should be

avoided, for fear that they will contribute to lasting poor labor force

experience, may be misplaced. Our evidence on persons graduating from
high school suggests, albeit indirectly, that this worry is unfounded

-6-

and in fact should be dominated by policies to encourage early work
experience, possibly without exaggerated initial concern for its rela-

tionship to a well defined hierarchy of future Jobs. We find no evidence that persons on average were hindered by the work experience that
they had in high school; on the contrary, the evidence suggests that

they may well have been helped. And, our evidence is that low-wage
Jobs after graduation do not in themselves increase the likelihood of
low wage jobs a few years hence.

We have distinguished weeks worked in the four years following

high school by the year in which the experience was had. Thus after
four years for example, we know how much an individual worked in each

of the three preceding years. As expected, we find that wage rates
at any given date are determined in part by previous experience.
Thus although there is no lasting effect of non-employment in one
year on employment in subsequent years, there is a cost associated

with early non-employment; it is lower wages in future years. The
effect of early labor force experience on subsequent wages is not
obviously different in magnitude from the effect of work experience

while in high school. But the effect of work experience while in high
school does not decline over the first five years in the labor force,
whereas there is some evidence that the effect of early labor force

experience on subsequent wages may decline over time. Thus high school
work experience may be capturing attributes that are in part at least
distinct from those associated with later labor market experience.

The pattern of the relationships between work while in high school and
weeks worked in subsequent years in the labor force provides further

evidence of this. Indeed the latter finding suggests strongly that

—7—

high school work experience is associated with individual attributes
that persist over time.

The average wage rates of whites and non-whites in the labor market
are quite close, with whites earning a bit more per hour after the first

year. But after controlling for other variables, non-whites seem to earn
a bit more per hour than whites. On the other hand, non-whites work
fewer weeks per year than whites on the average but we find little difference between the two groups after controlling for other variables.

After controlling for other variables, the probability that non-whites
are in school in each of the four years after high school is about 0.10
higher than the corresponding probability for whites.
In general, summary statistics based on the National Longitudinal

Study do not suggest severe employment problems for these high school

graduates. On the contrary, they suggest a group of persons moving
rather smoothly into the labor force.
Finally, employment ratios of both white and non—white high school

graduates based on these data are considerably higher than those calculated from Current Population Survey data, and unemployment rates much

lower. Although employment ratios of non-whites are lower than those
of whites, and unemployment rates higher, four years after high school

graduation they are close. The October 1976 white employment ratio
is .909 and the non-white ratio .875. Unemployment rates are .065 and
.081 respectively. Very few persons in the sample are chronically out
of school and unemployed.

The general outline of the paper is as follows: Section I contains
some general descriptive statistics on the transition from school to

work. Empirical estimates of weeks worked and wage equations are presented in Section II. They are accompanied by non-school attendance
equations. Section III is an analysis of the extent of persistence of
individual experience over time. Concluding remarks are contained in
Section IV.

I.

Some Descriptive Statistics on the Transition from School to Work.

Through the National Longitudinal Study of 1972 High School Seniors
data were obtained on almost 23,000 persons from over 1,300 high schools.

The high schools were a stratified sample of all public, private, and

church affiliated schools in the country. To increase the number of
disadvantaged" students in the sample, high schools located in low income
areas and schools with a high proportion of minority enrollment were
sampled at approximately twice the sampling rate used for the other schools.
The summary statistics reported below have not been adjusted to reflect

population proportions. They are reported, however, for whites and nonwhites separately. Both groups probably reflect more persons from low
income families than would be found in a random sample of the population.

We will present summary statistics in three groups: the first
on work and school status by year, the second on the likelihood of selected
sequences of school and work status over time, and the third on weekly
earnings and hours worked and annual employment and by year.

A. School and Work Status by Year.
The distribution of white and non-white males in the survey sample
by school and work status, together with some summary labor force statistics,

is shown in Table 1. (More detailed distributions by 9 school and 5 work
classifications are presented for five consecutive Octobers beginning in

1972 in tables available from the authors.) We will point out first some
general findings based on an examination of Table 1 and then indicate the

kind of detail that can be found in the more detailed tables, without
presenting an extensive discussion of it.

The most striking statistics in Table 1 are the comparatively low
unemployment rates and high employment ratios, as compared with those

based on Current Population Survey data. (See Freeman and Medoff [this
volume].) Although we cannot provide a direct comparison for each
October, we can for 1972.

In October of 1972, the Census Bureau conducted

a special survey of Spring 1972 high school graduates. (See Bureau of
Labor Statistics [1973], p. 27.) A comparison of unemployment and other
labor force statistics based on the two data sources is presented in the
tabulation below (for persons not in school).

An investigation of the definitions used in the two surveys does
not reveal any differences that would suggest such apparently contradictory

results, although the survey questions are not identical. Although the
NLS survey is weighted to oversample low income youth, this should tend

to raise implied unemployment rates, not to lower them. The survey
respondent, however, is the individual youth in the NLS survey, but is

likely to be the mother or father of the youth in the CPS survey. The
NLS data is collected through a mailed questionnaire (together with some
mail and telephone reminders), while the CPS data is obtained by interview
with a household member, often the female head.

Freeman and Medoff find

that a large portion of the difference between the CPS numbers and those
based on the Parnes National Longitudinal Survey can be attributed to the
di fferent respondents.

-12-

The summary statistics also reveal several differences between

white and non-white youth. The percent of white youth in school fulltime is approximately 12 percentage points higher than the percent of
non-whites until 1976, when many youth would have finished four years of

college. Of those not in school, the percent working full-time is about

8 to 10 points higher for whites than for non-whites. By 1976, the
percentages were about 80 and 72 respectively. The proportions working
part-time do not differ substantially in any of the years, although in
each year the percent for non-whites is somewhat higher than for whites.
It declines between 1972 and 1976 from 9.2 to 4.1 for whites and from 11.4

to 5.1 for non-whites. A larger proportion of non-whites than whites are
in the military. In 1974, the year of highest military participation
for both groups, about 12 percent of whites and 16 percent of non-whites
were in the armed forces.
More

blacks than whites are out of the labor force, but the differ-

ences are not large. The proportion "looking for work," however, is about
twice as high for non-whites as for whites in 1972 through 1974. The

differences decline in 1975 and 1976. The percent of whites looking for
work in 1976 was 5.7, versus 6.9 for non-whites.

The labor force participation rates are high for both groups and

do not differ substantially. Between 1972 and 1976 they moved from .93
to .97 for whites and .90 to .95 for non-whites. The employment ratio is
higher for whites than non-whites in 1972, .88 versus .78; but by 1976

the two ratios were much closer, .91 versus .88. This closing of the
gap between the two groups is reflected in the unemployment rate
which was more than twice as high for non-whites as for whites in 1972;

-13-

but by 1976, the two rates were rather close, .065 versus .081.

In short, these numbers suggest a cohort of youth moving rather

smoothly into the labor force. Although there are differences between
the statistics for whites and non-whites, they do not seem to us to be
striking.

In particular, the unemployment rates, although higher for non-

whites than whites, are not shocking to us for either group in any year.

By 1976, somewhat more than four years after graduation from high school,
labor force participation and employment ratios are high for both groups

and the unemployment rates are modest for both groups. Youth unemployment
does not appear from these data to be a severe problem for this group
of high school graduates.
From the statistics in the tables available from the authors, one

can find more detail within this more general picture. For example, it
can be seen that most youth who are working part-time are also in school

full—time, although the proportion is lower for non-whites than for

whites. Also, many persons looking for work are full-time students.
They were not included in the unemployment statistics reported above.

-14-

B.

Sequences of School and Work Status.

The average statistics reported above do not reveal extremely high

unemployment rates. But it could be that there are some youth who are
often unemployed. As a worst case, we have lumped together the persons
out of the labor force with those who are unemployed. In Table 2 are
reported the percent of persons not in school and not working (in either
civilian or military jobs) for each possible number and sequence of time

periods. For example, the sequence 10101 indicates not in school and not
working in October 1972, October 1974, and October 1976; but not in this

category in October 1973 nor in October 1975. The left digit pertains
to 1972.

Examination of Table 2 reveals that 81 percent of the sample were
not in this category in

of the five October periods. (The data per-

tain to the first full week in October of each year.) Only one-tenth
of one percent were out of school and not working in all of the periods.2
For whites and non-whites together, this represents 5 persons out of 9115.

Three-tenths of one percent were in this category 4 out of the 5 periods,

and one-tenth of one percent in 3 out of the 5. Only 14 percent were so
classified in 1 of the 5 periods. We do not find a large group of chronically not in school and not working youth. More non-whites than whites
were in this status for one, two, three, and four periods; but over 72
percent of non-whites were never out of school and without work in these

October periods. These data do suggest, however, that some youth are
much more likely to be in this category than others; there is hetero-

geneity among the group. For example, based on Table 1, about 5 percent
of white youngsters are in this category in any year. If a person had a
.05 probability of being in this category in any period and the

—15—

probabilities were independent over time, the likelihood of being in this
status three out of the five periods, for example, would be only .001,

much less than the observed proportion of .008 for all white males.
Similarly defined sequences and associated percentages for fulltime school and full-time work are reported in Tables 3 and 4 respectively.
Table 3 figures reveal that 36 percent of the sample were never in school

full-time, 35 percent for whites and 44 percent for non-whites. (While
these numbers suggest that whites are more often in school than non-whites;
the estimates below of the probability of attending school suggest a
higher probability for non-whites than whites, after controlling for
other relevant variables such as test scores and family background.)
Although there is some movement into and out of school, it is not

the norm. Of persons who go to school at all, 69 percent begin in the
first year after high school and attend only in consecutive years.

Eighty-four percent of those who attend at all, attend during the year

immediately after high school. The in and out possibility that is
sometimes emphasized, possibly more often for older persons, is not the
norm among this group.

While 36 percent of the sample were never in school full-time, only
24 percent worked full-time in each of the five periods, as can be seen in

Table 4. As could be inferred from the school attendance figures, we see
in Table 4, that a relatively large number of persons work the last 4, the
last 3, the last 2, or the last year; but none of the prior years.

C. Weekly Earnings and Hours, Annual Employment and Unemployment, and
Number of Employers.
Average hourly wage rates, weekly earnings and weekly hours worked
for persons not in school and for those in school are shown in Table 5.
They cover all persons in the sample who were working in the first full

week of October of the year indicated. Persons working full-time or
part-time are included. For persons out of school, wage rates for the
two groups are virtually identical right after graduation. After four
years, whites earn about 6 percent more per hour than non-whites, presumably due in part at least to the different schooling patterns of the

two groups and post-high school work experience. Non-whites also work
about 2 hours per week less than whites in each of the time periods and
thus have lower weekly earnings --

about 8 percent in the first year and

10 or 11 percent in each of the subsequent years.
On the other hand, non—whites who are in school work 1.5 to 3 hours
per week more than whites, earn somewhat more per hour in all but the
last period, and have higher weekly earnings in each of the periods --

between 5 and 19 percent depending on the period.
We also calculated the percent of persons with wage rates below

the Federal minimum. The results for October of each year are shown in
the tabulation below. These numbers presumably reflect in large part

wages of persons in jobs exempt from minimum wage legislation.
Average annual weeks worked, weeks looking, weeks out of the labor
force, and number of employers, by school status, are shown in Table 6.
Among persons out of school, non-whites work fewer weeks per year than
whites, but the difference declines continuously over the four-year

period. Non-whites work 13 percent less in the first year, 10 percent
in the second, 7 percent in the third, and 5 percent in the fourth. The
differences are accounted for by both weeks looking for work and weeks

out of the labor force. Differences among whites and non-whites in school
are somewhat less in general, although as among persons not in school
non-whites who are in school spend more weeks than whites looking for work.

II. High School Training and Labor Force Experience
Our goal is to estimate the effects of personal characteristics,
particularly high school preparation, on labor force experiences in the

years following high school graduation. The measures of labor force
experience we shall use are weeks worked and wage rates. We have annual
weeks worked for four years following high school graduation and wage

rates for five consecutive October periods, as described above. We
have estimated a week's worked equation separately for each of the four
years and a separate wage equation for each of the five October periods.
Jointly with each of the weeks worked and wage equations we have esti-

mated a "school non-attendance" equation. That is, the probability of
being in the sample, and thus having recorded wage or weeks worked

measures as defined below. We have followed this procedure in the first
instance to correct for possible bias in the parameters of the weeks

worked and wage equations. But the non-school attendance equations have
a behavioral interpretation in this case and the associated parameter
estimates are of interest distinct from their relationship to the weeks

worked and wage equation estimates. In addition, the procedure we have
used to estimate weeks worked accounts for the upper limit of 52 weeks

in a year. A large proportion of respondents report working a full 52-

week year. Parameter estimates obtained without recognizing this limit
tend to underestimate the effects of explanatory variables on weeks

worked. (An analogy would be the effect of knowledge about a subject
on' an examination score in that subject if the exam is very easy. After

some level of knowledge, more doesn't help. You can't score above 100.)
Thus we have combined a Tobit specification for weeks worked with a Probit

—25—

non-school attendance specification. Finally, in Section III, we shall
discuss the relationships between weeks worked and wage rates over time.
A more precise description of the approach we have followed to

estimate weeks worked is presented in Section A below. The variant
of this procedure used to estimate wages is iescribed in Section B. The
results are then discussed in turn, beginning with estimates of the
probability of school attendance, followed by parameter estimates for
the weeks worked and wage rate equations.

A. The Weeks Worked Estimation Procedure
Suppose that weeks worked in each of 4 years are indicated by Y1

through V4. Assume also that in each period there are vectors of
"exogenous" variables X1 through X4. In practice, these vectors will
be composed largely of variables like test scores and family background
that do not change over time, although some like schooling and work

experience do. Let the relationships between weeks worked and the exogenous variables for individuals in the population, should they decide
to work, be described by,

want to restrict the influence of variables like high school work

-26-

experience to be constant over time. On the contrary, we would like
to see if their effects change, and if so, how.
Two groups of individuals are distinguished --

those who are in

school and those who are not. Persons included in our out of school
group were not in school in either the October beginning the year, nor

in the following October. Although one might well consider the deter—
minants of weeks worked for persons in either group, we will concen-

trate on those not in school. We judged that the labor market behavior
of the two groups would be quite different and we did not want estimates
that confounded the decisions of both.

Each of the equations (1) is

presumed to describe the work experience of persons in the population
should they decide not to go to school in the year indicated by the subscripts 1 through 4.

Suppose that there are four unobserved variables S.c, one for each

of the four time periods. Define them by

Sli = Z1161 +
52i =

S4. =

is assumed to be normally distributed, we have for each

period a probit specification of the probability of not being in school:

know that estimation of any of the

only on persons not in school in year t, will yield biased coefficient

estimates if

and

are correlated.5 We could correct for this

potential bias by estimating jointly for each year the weeks worked
equation and the corresponding choice-of-status, or school attendance,
equation.

6

In our case, however, the upper limit on weeks worked has an
important effect on the estimates of

in equation (1) and thus on

the interpretation of the relationship between preparation in high

school and post-high school labor force experience. The percent distribution of weeks worked for persons not in school by selected interval

is shown for each of the four years in the tabulation below. The

percent reporting fifty-two weeks of work ranges from 39 in 1973 to 52

in 1976. It is apparently the case that many persons are prepared to
work, and have work opportunities, that exceed the time available constraint as measured in weeks.7

Thus we have changed the specification in equation (1), interpreting capital Y1 as an unobserved "propensity' to work, with observed
weeks worked given by,

The maximum likelihood procedure we have used estimates $ in (5) jointly
with 6 in (2), for each of the four years individually. It is explained

in more detail in Appendix A. The relationship between the expected
value of Y given by X and the expected value of weeks worked, E(y),
may be seen in the figure below, in which one right-hand variable is
assumed.

Figure 1

At low levels of X, the estimated parameter

represents the approxi-

mate effect of a change in X on the expected number of weeks worked.
As X increases, its effect on weeks worked approaches zero. 8 For example, our results reported below suggest that

is about twice as large

as the derivative of E(y) with respect to X, evaluated at X. At the
mean of the variables in our sample, the expected number of weeks worked
is about 44, and the expected value of the unobserved Y is somewhat

greater than 52. The derivative of E(y) with respect to X at X is approximately equal to the estimate of

from a specification that does not

distinguish employment at the limit of 52 weeks from observations below 52.
There were also a few persons each year who did not work at all.
We obtained some initial estimates that accounted for this by specifying

weeks worked to be bounded at zero, as well as 52. It did not significantly affect our results and we did not incorporate it in the results

-30-

presented below.

An alternative to separate estimates for each year is to divide

the sample into two groups: one composed of persons who were never in
school, and the other composed of everyone else. But for our purposes
the procedure outlined above has at least two advantages over this one.
First, it allows us to make use of as much of the data as possible.9
Examination of Table 3 shows that the number of persons out of school in

all years is much smaller than the number in any single year.° Also,
even if the group with weeks worked is defined in the alternative way,
a sample selection correction must still be made to obtain unbiased
estimates of the population parameters in the weeks worked equations.
This presumably would be done by estimating a probit equation pertaining

to the probability of never being in school. Such an equation could be
used to correct each of the weeks worked equations for the sample selec-

tion bias.11 But it is difficult to think of a behavioral interpretation
for this sample selection equation, since in a given year one group in-

cludes persons who are in school as well as some who are not. Our status
equations can be interpreted in each year as estimating the determinants
of school attendance in that year.

B. The Wage Rate Estimation Procedure
Wage rate equations were also estimated jointly with non-school

attendance equations. There are five wage equations, however, one for
each of the October survey periods. But there is no limit problem as
with weeks worked. Parameters in equations like (1) and (2) for weeks
worked were estimated jointly, with the logarithm of the wage sub-

stituted for weeks worked.12 There is, however, a complication that
does not arise in the weeks worked equation.

-31-

Wage rates are presumed to depend on years of schooling, as well

as other variables. For example, persons who were working in the fourth
October period may have been in school during some or all of the previous periods, and their wage rates may be expected to depend on the

amount of schooling. Suppose that the logarithm of the wage is given
by,

W4. =

X4c4 + aiAi + a2A2 + a3A3 + '4i

where A1 equals 1 if individual i was in school during period 1 and

zero if not, and similarly for A2 and A3. The potential bias resulting
from the possibility that E(v41 s4.1 = 1) may not be zero is corrected
for by estimating the equation jointly with the probability of non-school

attendance. But if the

are correlated with the error in the non-

school attendance equations, and the flt'S or the v's are correlated

over time, then A1 through A3 may be correlated with the error

in the

wage equation. To overcome this problem, we experimented with an

instrument for prior schooling)3 In practice, we found that the use of
an instrument for schooling did not substantially alter the character

of our conclusions)4 A similar problem may pertain to work experience
that is also assumed to determine the wage rate. We did not attempt to
correct for it.

(In subsequent work we will estimate a more appropriate

model for solving this problem. It will allow joint estimation of weeks
worked, wage, schooling, and a sample selection equation.)

Finally, the sample selection equations estimated with the wage
rate equations are not precisely non-school attendance equations, al-

though in practice the two are almost interchangeable. The weeks worked

—32-

equation for a given year included all persons who were not in school

during that year. Thus the status or sample selection equations are
equivalent to school attendance equations. Students were also excluded
from the wage equations. But we do not have wage rates for all persons

who were not students. Some non-students were also not employed. To
correct the wage equation for sample selection bias we need to consider

all persons without a recorded wage rate, whatever the reason)5
The variables used in the analysis are defined below.

Weeks Worked: Annual weeks worked, October to October.
Wage Rate: Earnings divided by hours worked, first full week in
October.

Test Scores Total: Sum of scores on six tests -

vocabulary,

read-

ing, mathematics, picture-number, letter groups, mosaic comparisons.

Class Rank in High School: Percentile ranking relative to other
persons in individual's high school.
Job Training in High School :

One if the individual received in

high school "any specialized training intended to prepare you for

immediate employment upon leaving school? (For example, auto
mechanics, secretarial skills, or nurses aid)," zero otherwise.

Hours Worked during High School: Response to the question, 'On
the average over the school year, how many hours per week do you

work in a paid or unpaid job? (Exclude vacation.)" The response
was by interval: 0, 1-5, 6-10, ..., 26—30, over 30.

-33—

Parents' Income: Annual income of parents, in thousands.
Education of Mother (Father) less than High School: One if the
youth's mother (father) had less than a high school education and
zero otherwise.

Education of Mother (Father) College Degree or More: One if the
youth's mother (father) had a college degree or more education,

and zero otherwise. The excluded category is a high school degree
but less than a college degree.

Race: One if non-white, zero otherwise.
Dependents: Number of persons dependent on the individual for
income.

School Years: Number of Octobers in which the individual said
he was in school.

On the Job Training: Months of on-the-job training.
Experience:

Work experience, in years. Excludes work

while attending a post-secondary school. Experience is distinguished by the year in which it occurred.

Part-Time Working: One if the individual is working part-time,
zero otherwise.

Rural, Urban: One if the individual's residence location corresponds to the one indicated, zero otherwise. The excluded category
is suburban and town.

West: One if the person lives in the West, zero otherwise.
State Wage: Annual average wage in manufacturing.

-34-

State Unemployment: Average annual unemployment rate.
Missing Variable Indicators: For test scores, class rank, parents'
income, experience. Each is one if the designated variable is

missing and zero otherwise. The corresponding variable takes
the value zero if it is missing and the recorded value if it is
not.

The means and standard deviations of these variables are given in
Appendix Table C.

C. School Attendance
As a concomitant of the procedure used to estimate both the weeks
worked and the wage equations we estimated school attendance equations,

or more precisely, the probability of not attending school. Before
presenting results on the central questions of our analysis, we will

summarize briefly the implications of the estimated attendance probabil ity parameters.

Non-school attendance equations estimated with the weeks worked
equations are presented in Table 7B; those estimated with the wage equations

are shown in Table 8B. The two sets of parameter estimates are necessarily
very similar. The discussion in this section is based on those estimated
with weeks worked. Recall that the parameter estimates in Table 7B are
analogous to the parameters

in equations (2) and (4). The variables

used in the probability equations are easily identifiable by glancing

at the table. They need no further explanation. The first two groups
of variables pertain to school achievement and family background. All
are measured with considerable precision, as shown in the table.
To get a better idea of the importance of the variables, however,

we have calculated estimated differences in the probability of attending
school for persons who have different values of a specified variable,

but the same values for all the others. All other variables were assumed
to have values equal to their respective means. The specified differences
and the associated differences in estimated school attendance probabilities are shown in the tabulation below.

Possibly the most notable fi nding is that the probability that non-

whites are in school, controlling for other variables, is considerably
higher than for whites, at least .10 in each of the five years.

16
(Recall

that the sunhilary numbers in Table 1 show that in each of the first four

years following high school, the percent of non-whites in school fulltime was between 11 and 13 percentage points less than the percent for

whites.) This could result from relatively fewer opportunities in the

labor force. But as indicated in the wage equation estimates, discussed
below, after controlling for other variables, there is little difference
between the wage rates of whites and non-whites in the first three years;
in the last two, non-whites are estimated to earn about 4 percent more

than whites.17 And the weeks worked equations indicate that after
h. Based on the non-school attendance equation estimated with the
1976 wage equation. See Table 8B.

-37-

controlling for other variables non-whites work about the same number of

weeks per year as whites. It could also reflect higher returns to education for non-whites than for whites, as discussed by Freeman [l976a,
1976b], for example.

The other academic and family background variables are all related
in the expected way to school attendance, although the relative mag-

nitudes may not be widely known. Parents' income seems to have much less
effect on school attendance than either of the measures of academic

achievement. Parents' income may be the least important of all the
variables listed. Class rank seems somewhat more important than the
test scores, although our comparison is only suggestive. Recall that
the tests measure a range of abilities and achievements, some more

academically oriented than others. Also, we have made no attempt to
distinguish types of school. The relative importance of academic ability
is likely to increase with the quality of school.18 Finally, there are
large differences in expected probability of school attendance asso-

ciated with extremes in parents education.
In an alternative specification of the school attendance equations
in Table 7B we also included the number of hours worked per week in high
school--measured-—as one of seven intervals, 1 to 5, 6 to 10, . .

.

over 30--and a variable indicating whether or not the individual had job
training during high school. It is questionable whether the job training variable (and possibly hours worked in high school) should be in-

cluded in a school attendance equation. The question arises because

-38-

job training in high school may indicate a "non—college trait" and thus
a prior decision not to go to school——it may be more an indicator of

post-secondary school attendance rather than a determinant of it. But
because the relationship between these choices while in high school and
later school attendance may be of interest we have reported the results

when they are included. Their inclusion has a negligible effect on the
other parameter estimates.19
Persons who work more than about twenty hours per week in high
school are considerably less likely to be in school in any of the four
years than those who work less, according to the estimates of the coeffi-

cients on hours worked in high school. The average effect on the probability of school attendance of working 21 to 25, 26 to 30, or more than
30 hours per week is about .10, with the probability evaluated at the

means of the other variables. Persons who work less than twenty hours
per week are also less likely to be in school during the first year after
high school than those who don't work at all, but the relevant coefficients are not measured very precisely. 20 In the remaining three years,

the estimates indicate little relationship between post-secondary school
attendance and hours worked in high school until hours worked exceeds
20 hours per week approximately.

Recall that these are estimates after controlling for high school

achievement and family background. We will show below that, with a few
notable exceptions, the number of hours worked during high school is not
strongly related to most measures of socioeconomic background nor to

school achievement. It is largely an independent personal characteristic.

—39-

Recall that only for persons who work many hours per week during high
school is such work significantly related to later school attendance.

There is a tendency for persons who work a lot to be less inclined to

continue their formal schooling. Possibly some have made a prior
decision to work rather than go to school. We will see, however, that
hours worked in high school are strongly related to weeks worked per

year after graduation. As expected, persons who get job training in
high school are considerably less likely to go to school later than
those who don't.

Only two of the other variables in Table 8B need be mentioned; the

others may be thought of simply as controls. One might suppose that school
attendance would depend on expected wage if not in school and the ease
of finding work; thus the state wage and unemployment variables have

been included in the probability equations. They could be considered
as rough instruments for individual wage and unemployment rates. Neither
is significantly different from zero in most years, although the wage
rate in each year is negatively related to school attendance and the

unemployment rate positively related. The wage rate is significantly
different from zero by standard criteria during the first two years.
It could be that labor force opportunities are important determinants
of school attendance right after high school

,

but that in the later

years, once in school, persons don't drop out due to changes in the
wage rate, and they are less likely to enter school having not attended

previously. The marginal lifetime return to an additional year of
school probably increases as one nears college graduation.

-40-

Finally, persons who go to rural high schools are less likely to
be in school after graduation--the difference in probability is about
.06 in the first two years and .12 and .13 respectively in the third
and fourth years.

D. Weeks Worked
Estimates of the parameters in the weeks worked equations are

shown in Table 7A. The most significant finding is that hours worked
while in high school bear a substantial relationship to weeks worked

per year in the years imediately following high school graduation.
The estimated coefficients corresponding to hours worked intervals in

high school are reproduced in the tabulation below. As can be seen in
Table 7A, they are measured with considerable precision. Recall that
they represent an upper bound on the effect of high school work. They
are slightly larger than the estimated effect of high school hours

worked on expected weeks worked, evaluated at X close to zero. As
the expected value of V rises, and thus the expected value of weeks

worked, the marginal effect of hours worked in high school falls. Indeed, as the expected number of weeks worked approaches 52, the marginal

effect of a change in any variable declines, and must ultimately approach
zero.

To give an idea of the magnitude of the decline, we have evaluated

the estimated effects of high school work at two additional points. One
is the expected value of weeks worked evaluated at the mean of X for
all persons in the sample, whether they were in fact in the labor force

or in school. These values are shown in the second portion of the tabulation.

In addition, the expected value of weeks worked is shown for

each year, along with an uadjustment factor.'1 The adjustment factor
indicates the multiple by which the estimates in the first portion of the
table must be multiplied to get the estimates in the second portion.21

-46-

The other evaluation point is the mean f X for persons who were in
the labor force and conditional on knowing that they were. The estimated effect on weeks worked over the four year period is shown in
the last column.

Estimates of the

coefficients on hours worked range from zero

for hours between 1 and 5 to over twelve for hours greater than 30.
Even in the fourth year, the estimated values of

are very large,

ranging from 3 for the fewest hours category to over 8 for the largest.

It is notable, that after four years, the relationship of even a little

work in high school to work after high school is substantial. Over the
four year period, the sum of the estimates range continuously upward
from 6 weeks to 37 weeks.

Expected weeks worked per year evaluated at the mean of the righthand variables averaged over all persons in the sample is about 47

weeks in each of the four years. Even at this level

,

the estimated

relationship to work in high school is very large. The average over
the four years of the effect of working between 16 and 20 hours per

week is about 1.5 weeks per year. For persons who worked over 30 hours,
the average of the estimated effects is almost 3 weeks per year. The
sums of the effects for the four years range from 2 to ii weeks.

Possibly the most intuitively meaningful results pertain to persons

who did in fact choose to work rather than go to school. Expected
weeks worked evaluated at the mean of X over persons observed to be in

the labor force is .bout 44 weeks in each of the four years. The
sums of the effects over the four years range from almost 3

to

close to

18 weeks. Sixteen to twenty hours of work in high school is associated
with an average of almost 3 weeks per year in weeks worked during
the four years after graduation.

Estimates of the marginal relationship between hours worked in
high school and weeks worked, evaluated at any other expected value of

-48-

weeks worked, can be obtained by multiplying the numbers in the top por-

tion of the tabulation by the appropriate adjustment factor. For exrnple,
the appropriate multiple when the expected value of weeks worked [E(y)]

is thirty is approximately .86 in each of the four years.22

How to interpret this finding is open to question. It is possible
that persons who work in high school gain skills and other attributes,
through their work, that give them an advantage in the labor market

after graduation. Demand may be greater for them than for persons who
do not work. This is consistent with the finding that wage rates are
also higher for persons who work in high school, although the relation-

ship is not nearly as strong as that between weeks worked and work in
high school. But we might expect such an advantage to diminish over
time, as post-high school experience becomes an increasingly larger pro-

portion of total experience. And although the estimated effect declines
somewhat, it is still very important four years after graduation. This
suggests that working in high school may be an indication of personal
characteristics not gained through work, but leading to work in high
school as well as greater labor force participation following graduation.
That is, it is not that the demand is greater for persons who work in
high school, but that these persons have a greater propensity to work.
That wage rates are not so greatly affected by high school work seems
to add to the evidence for this interpretation.
Even this latter interpretation, however, would not rule out the
possibility that work experience while in high school, for persons
like those in our sample who did not work, would increase their

employment after high school. Working may in fact enhance in these

-49-

persons attributes that were associated with high school work of

persons in our sample. And, as we shall see below, work experience
while in high school may increase subsequent wage rates in much the
same way that work experience upon graduation increases later wage
rates in the labor market.

It is informative to consider these findings and possible inter-

pretations of them, in conjunction with the relationship between work in

high school and other school and family characteristics. We shall return
to that after some discussion of some of the other results shown in
Table 7A.

Class rank in high school is strongly related to weeks worked in

each of the four post-high school years. The estimates indicate that a
50 point increase in class rank is associated with an increase of about
10 in the expected value of Y, or say 3 in the expected value of weeks

worked, over the total sample. This result is based on holding constant
the test score. The test score appears to measure a combination of
aptitude and achievement. No matter what the interpretation of test
score, conditional on holding it constant, class rank is likely to reflect

effort directed to doing well in high school. Effort in school, like
the characteristic reflected in high school work, is related to later

labor force participation at least for the next four years. Both hours
worked and class rank may capture what is sometimes referred to as the

work ethic.u Those who work harder in high school also work more in
subsequent years. Or, those who become accustomed to working at a young
age maintain the habit. Or, if they have or develop early in life
characteristics associated with working, they maintain them.
We also find that high test scores are associated with more employ-

-50-

ment after graduation, but the effect diminishes over the four years

following graduation. An increase of one standard deviation-—about
.4--in the sum of the test scores is associated with a 1½ week increase
in expected weeks worked in the first year and declines continuously to
about 1 week in the fourth.

It may be that persons with greater ability

or achievement, as reflected in the test scores have an advantage in
the labor market, but as time goes on the skills that are associated
with the test scores are in part compensated for by skills developed

on the job or elsewhere. That their effect diminishes over time suggests that the reason is not entirely a permanent underlying individual

characteristic. (The wage equation estimates suggest some advantage
to higher test scores, but there is no distinct time pattern.)
We could find no measure of high school vocational or industrial
training that was significantly related to employment, or wage rates, after

graduation. The variable included in the results in Table 7A is high
school training for a particular job. We assumed that if any high school

training mattered, this training should. It doesn't. We experimented
with many other measures of job related training -- semesters of various
vocational courses, academic versus non-academic tracking, and others.

We found none that was related to subsequent employment. It could be
that the least able are directed to vocational training courses, or self-

selected into them. But our results are conditional on controlling for
traditional measures of school performance --

class

rank and test scores.

-51-

This cannot be interpreted to mean that no training matters; but it does
indicate strongly that none of the training in current high school
curricula, or at least that systematically measured in the survey, is
related to later labor force participation after high
not able to distinguish vocational high

school. We were

schools from others. In sub-

sequent work we will. It is possible that the effect of training in
a vocational high school is different from the effect of training
received in schools whose curricula are not primarily directed to job
training.

Non-whites are employed about the same number of weeks per year
as whites during the first years following high school graduation. The
differences between the expected value of weeks worked for non-whites
and whites, evaluated at the mean of X in the sample, are -.52, .05, .11,
and -.29 respectively in the first four years following high school grad-

uation. None is significantly different from zero by standard criteria.
Remember that these results are partial effects after controlling for
other variables, unlike the summary statistics in the first section of
the paper.

(The simple averages in Table 6 indicate fewer weeks worked

by non-whites than whites during the first two years after high school

but little difference in the third and almost none in the last.) The
wage estimates below indicate that after controlling for other variables,
wage rates of whites and non-whites are quite close in the first three
October periods and in the last two that non-whites earn about 4 percent

more per hour than whites. And the averages in Table 5 indicate whites
and non-whites who are not in school have very similar weekly earnings
and hours worked, as well as wages.
Parents' income bears a substantial positive relationship to weeks

worked during each of the first four years after graduation. In the
first year, an increase in parental income of $5,000—-about a standard
deviation--is associated with an increase in weeks worked of over 3

weeks. The relevant coefficient declines over time to about half of its
original size by the fourth year. If children whose parents have higher
paying jobs have an advantage in finding work, the advantage apparently
diminishes as the youth cohort gains labor market experience.
In sum, the most important determinants of weeks worked seemed to
be characteristics associated with effort pursuant to succeeding in high
school, as measured by class rank after controlling for ability, and to
effort devoted to outside work while in high school, in particular the

latter. It may be informative therefore to consider the relationship
between hours of work while in high school and other personal and family
characteristics.

For descriptive purposes, we have obtained coefficient estimates
from a least squares regression of hours worked per week on several vari-

ables. The coefficients and standard errors pertaining to the variables

of most interest are listed above, 2 There are two groups of variables:

one that can be interpreted as composed of predetermined personal and
family characteristics; the second group is composed of measures of the
individuals' high school experience other than hours worked while in

high school. There seems not to be a substantial tradeoff between any
of these latter measures and hours worked, For example, working does
not seem to take the place of studying, as reflected in class rank after

controlling for test scores. Comparable results were found by Griliches
[1977].

Race is the only variable that stands out. Non-whites work considerably less in high school than whites, given the measures of parents'

income and education. This may result either from differences between
the two groups in job opportunities, or from differences in work habits,

or some combination of the two. Whatever the reason, 5 hours less work
in high school is associated with a maximum of about 1.5 fewer weeks
worked in the years following graduation, according to the weeks worked

results. Recall that after controlling for hours worked in high school
as well as other variables, non-whites work about the same number of
weeks per year as whites.
In addition, persons with higher test scores work a bit less and

those with higher parents' income a bit more. (The standard deviation
of test scores is .4 and of parents' income is 5.7, inthousands.)
The latter may result from more job possibilities if one's parents have
better jobs, or it may reflect cultural differences related to income.

-54-

Possibly persons with higher test scores, given class rank, foresee a
greater probability of going to college and thus are somewhat less

inclined to take jobs in high school. This is consistent with the non—
school attendance results.

Thus we have in hours worked in high school a personal characteristic that is somewhat related to race, test scores, and parents' income.24

But after controlling for these variables hours worked in high school
is strongly related to weeks worked after graduation. Hours worked

captures an individual attribute that is not simply a reflection of other

personal and family socioeconomic characteristics. It reflects a largely
independent personal attribute that persists over time.
We shall mention briefly the effects of the remaining variables

in Table 7B. The estimated effect of on-the-job training is always
positive, but it declines over time. This result may be due to training
agreements or employment expectations that lead to training for persons
who expect to continue in the same job, or who employers expect to con-

tinue. The effect might be expected to die out over time as persons are
increasingly likely to have changed jobs.

Persons living in urban areas are employed less than others. According to our imprecise estimates, the maximum negative effect is 2.2 weeks;
in the last year when a larger proportion of those working are college
graduates the estimated urban effect is in fact positive, although not

significantly different from zero. College graduates may have relatively
greater work opportunities in urban areas. As expected, state unemployment is negatively related to employment of

youth. Roughly speaking, if

the unemployment rate increases by a percentage point expected weeks
worked by these youth falls by about half a week, about one percent of the

mean value of weeks worked. The higher the state wage as we have
measured it, the lower the number of weeks worked by youth.25
Finally, for each year our procedure estimates the correlation
between the random term in the weeks worked equation and the random

term in the probability of non-school attendance equation. They are
reported for each year in the last section of Table 7B. Recall that a
zero correlation coefficient indicates no sample selection bias. Our
estimates (and standard errors) for the four consecutive years are,

-.93 (.03), -.93 (.02), -.87 (.05), and —.82 (.05). That is, in each
year unmeasured determinants of college attendance bear a very strong
positive relationship to unmeasured determinants of weeks worked.
Holding constant the variables we have measured, persons who choose to
go to school would work more if they were in the labor force than those

who choose not to go to school after high school. The relationship is
very striking. The results seem to indicate that the motivations or
drives that characterize persons who continue their education are also
attributes that are related to increased employment if not attending

school. In practice, correction for sample selection, by estimating
jointly weeks worked and the probability of non-school attendance, increases substantially the estimated coefficients on class rank, test
scores, and parents' income, but yields coefficients on the other vari-

ables that are close to Tobit results. For purposes of comparison, weeks
worked parameter estimates by method of estimation are presented in
Appendix Table B.

We have not in this specification of weeks worked included a

schooling variable. One might suppose, however, that if the proba-

bility of school attendance in a given year is positively related to
the number of weeks a person would work if he were in the labor force,
then also the number of years of schooling prior to a given year would
be likely to affect weeks worked in that year if a person were in the

labor force. When prior schooling is included in the weeks worked
equations, however, its effect is not significantly different from
zero, even with prior schooling also included in the sample selection

equation. This suggests that the large correlation between unmeasured
determinants of school attendance and measured determinants of weeks

worked reflects the difference between persons who attend school for
several years after high school graduation--possibly long enough to

obtain a degree —and those who don't. Apparently persons who move in
and out of school during the first four years after graduation are in
this respect much like persons who don't attend school at all.

E.

Wage Rates

The wage rate parameter estimates are reported in Table 8A. Some
have been referred to already. Work experience in high school is positively related to post-high school wage rates, as well as to weeks worked.
In general, during the last four periods, persons who worked in high
school earned roughly 5 to 9 percent more per hour than those who didn't.
Thus not only are additional hours of work in high school associated
with additional weeks worked after graduation, but higher earnings

per hour as well. But although there is an increasing relationship
between the number of hours worked in high school and weeks worked
later; given 5 or 10 hours per week, additional hours in high school

are not associatedwith increments in wage rates until high school hours
exceed 30 per week.20 For these reasons, we have used only three highschool-work intervals instead of the seven used in the weeks worked
equations.

To evaluate the relationship between hours worked in high school
and annual earnings, we need to consider the association between high

school work and both weeks worked and the wage rate. (We have not considered the possible effect on hours worked per week.) In addition,
according to our specification the marginal effect of any variable on
weeks worked depends on the number of weeks worked at which the marginal

effect is evaluated. (See pages 29 and 46.) Consider, for example,
persons in the labor force who otherwise --

if not for high school work

experience -- would have worked 44 weeks per year. This is approximately the average number of weeks worked by persons who were in the

labor force (see page 46). According to our estimates, those who worked

-58-

between 16 and 20 hours in high school earned about 12 percent more than

those who didn't work at all in high school. Persons who worked over
30 hours earned about 18 percent more. The effect could be much greater
for persons who would otherwise work less. For example, consider persons
who would work only 30 weeks per year. Those who worked 16 to 20 hours
in high school would earn about 25 percent more than those who didn't

work at all. Those who worked more than 30 hours, would earn about 35
percent more. These latter figures should be considered only as indicative because the estimates do not allow interactions among the variables
and therefore imply substantial extrapolation based on estimated coeffi-

cients. Nonetheless, the relationship between earnings and work in high
school is certainly large even for persons who are working most of the
time and is probably much larger for persons who, based on other characteristics, would work much less.

As with weeks worked, it seems likely that at least part of the
effect results from personal characteristics associated with or devel-

oped through high school work as distinct from later work. If higher
wage rates were the result simply of the additional experience or
associated acquired skills one would expect both to be dominated
eventually by post-high school work experience, and the estimated effect
to decline over time.

27

Note that the estimated coefficients on high

school work do not simply reflect the fact that persons who work while
in high school also are employed more upon graduation and thus have
higher wage rates because of more cumulated post-high school experience.

The measured effect of high school experience is in addition to work
experience after high school, also included in the equations.

-59-

Test scores and class rank are also positively related to wage rates.
The effect of class rank seems to diminish somewhat with time, but the
test score coefficients follow no apparent pattern. A standard deviation
increase in the test scores total is associated with an average of
estimated wage rate increases over the five periods of about 3 percent.

The corresponding class rank effect is about 2 or 3 percent. The total
effect of a standard deviation increase in both would be something

like 5 or 6 percent. Together these measures may be assumed to represent some combination of academic aptitude, academic achievement, and

academic success. Controlling for test score, class rank may also
reflect effort in school comparable to hours worked as a measure of
effort outside of school, as discussed in the section above on weeks
worked. Any one of these attributes would presumably increase productiv-.
ity per unit of time.

While traditional measures of academic success are positively related

to wage rates, as areattributes associated with actual work experience
in high school

,

high school training which is presumably closely directed

to the development of job skills is not. The estimated coefficients on
job training during high school are not significantly different from

zero. This suggests that time taken from academic courses and devoted
to job training instead, has a negligible effect on future wage rates.
If high school training contributes to the development of job-related
skills, they are at least offset by the loss in traditional academic

training related to job performance. It is also possible that persons
who are relatively poor academic performers and would be relatively
poor job performers are self—selected into job training courses in

-60-

high school. But as mentioned above, our estimates are conditional on
class rank and test scores, possibly the most common measures of high
school performance.

One might suppose that the effect of high school training would
be greater for persons who left school after high school graduation

than for those who obtained further education. Vocational training,
for example, may be more important in jobs filled by high school

graduates than in those typically filled by college graduates.
Our wage data for 1972 includes only high school graduates; for that
year the coefficient on high school training is negative but not
statistically different from zero.

In subsequent years, the sample with

observed wage rates includes high school graduates as well as those with

more education. Thus for 1974 and 1976 we reestimated the equations for
high school graduates only; the coefficients on high school training
were positive for each of these years but not statistically different
from zero by standard criteria.2d

While non-whites worked about the same number of weeks as whites
after controlling for other variables (Table 7A), the wage rates of
non-whites are a bit higher than those of whites, according to our esti-

mates. The coefficient on race is positive in each of the five periods
and significantly different from zero by standard criteria in the last
two periods.

In the fourth and fifth time periods, non-whites are es-

timated to earn about 4 percent more per hour than whites. (The summary
statistics in Tables 5 and 6 show that the average wage rates of nonwhites were slightly lower than the white averages in all but the first
period and non-whites worked somewhat fewer weeks per year than whites
in each year, not controlling for other variables.)

-61-

Parents1 income has a substantial effect on wage rates. An increase
of ten thousand dollars in parents1 income is associated with an increase

in wage rates of 8 to 12 percent. It may be that children of wealthier
parents have different skills, values, or ambitions than those from

poorer families. And presumably, wealthier parents are able to find, or
help to find, better paying jobs for their children. The preponderance
of young persons say that their jobs were found through family contacts

or through friends. The effect of this benefit as reflected in wage
rates seems not to decline much over our five periods; the advantage is

maintained for at least these first four years.29 Recall that the
positive relationship between parents' income and weeks worked declined
over time.

Persons with dependents not only are employed more, but earn more
per hour as well --

approximately

3 percent per dependent in each period.

This may result from greater pressure to find higher paying jobs, as

well as to work more. Persons without dependents may be more willing
to accept lower wages, at least temporarily, possibly while looking
for another job.

On—the-job training does not yield appreciably higher wage rates

during the first year or two after high school. But after that, when
training has presumably paid off in better jobs, the effect shows up.
By the fifth time period, the return to a year of on-the-job training
is estimated to be 7.2 percent.3° In the second, third, and fourth
periods the estimated returns are 1.4, 2.5, and 6.1 percent respectively.

While the estimated effect of on-the-job training increases over
time, our estimates suggest a decline over time in the return to years

of post-secondary schooling. The estimates shown were obtained using
nominal years of schooling.31 As explained in Section II, these esti-

-62-

mates should be expected to be biased. Indeed the positive relationship between the unobserved determinants of wage rates and school attendance, together with the positive correlation among the wage disturbance
(discussed in the next section), imply that the estimates are biased
upward. 321n the second, third, fourth, and fifth time periods -- one,
two, three and four years after high school graduation --

the schooling

coefficients imply returns of 7.4, 5.5, 4.3 and 1.7 percent respectively.
The results for the last period may be somewhat confounded because college
graduates just entering the labor force are included in the sample.
College graduates are likely to be in jobs with wage structures substan-

tially different from persons without college degrees. There may not
have been enough time for a college degree to pay off in terms of progression up the hierarchy associated with higher level jobs.

In addi-

tion, the result may reflect declines in the return to college education.

The estimated returns to experience are substantially greater than
to schooling during these first years following high school graduation.35

Unlike the effect of hours worked in high school, the effect of early
experience on later wage rates declines according to this specification.
For example, a year of experience during the first year after graduation
is associated with a 13 percent increase in wage rates in the second time

period (the second October after graduation). The effect declines to
10 percent by the third, 6 percent by the fourth and 4 percent by the
fifth period.

In general, the effect on wage rates of recent expe-

rience is greater than the effect of earlier experience. Relative to the
second, third, and fourth time periods -relevant --

for

which experience is

the estimated effect of previous experience in the last time

-63-

period is quite low, 4 percent for experience during the first two years

and 5 or 6 percent for experience in the third and fourth years. Lest
this pattern of results be taken too literally, we hasten to add two
qualifications. The first is that the relative effect of experience
across the time periods is dependent in part on changes in aggregate

market conditions over the time period. Experience during the recession
years is likely to have contributed less to earnings than experience in

more expansive years. These results are of course determined in part by
changes in aggregate market conditions over the 1972 to 1976 time period.36

Second, the specification as shown distinguishes experience by
calendar year, but not by the number of years since leaving school.
Thus, for example, experience in the "second year" may represent expe-

rience during the second year in the labor force for some persons, but
during the first year in the labor force for others -- those who went to
school for one year after high school and then entered the labor force.
We tried two other formulations to check the sensitivity of the results

to changes in specification. For 1974 we distinguished a separate
experience variable for each possible schooling—labor force sequence.
Thus for persons who didn't go to school after high school we allowed
one experience variable for the first year in the labor force and another
for experience in the second; these estimates (and standard errors)

were .062 (.051) and .071 (.059) respectively. For persons who went to
school the first year and entered the labor force the second, the

coefficient on this first year of experience was .034 (.037). For those
who were in the labor force the first year but went to school the second,

the coefficient on the first year of experience was .042 (.059).
As mentioned above, for 1974 and 1976 we also estimated wage equations

-64-

for

persons with no Post-secondary education. (Of course, persons in

the sample in 1972, had no education past high school.) For this group,
the estimated experience coefficients for 1974 were .116 (.057) and
.134 (.074) respectively, as compared with .100 (.032) and .074 (.035)
in Table 8 A.

For 1976, the coefficients were measured very imprecisely

but tended to be somewhat larger than those shown in the table. Thus it
seems clear that early experience affects later wage rates. The precise
patterns of the effects shifts with the sample and the specification

although the differences are not statistically significant. Finally,
we noted above that vocational training in high school was not significantly different from zero, even for persons with no post-secondary

education. These estimates for 1974 and 1976 do reveal, however, that
work experience in high school has a somewhat greater effect on wage

for persons who got no further education than for the group as a

rates

whole.
The effect of experience as well as other variables is reflected
of course in the small difference between the average wage rates of

whites and non-whites shown in Table 5. For example, the average wage
rate for whites is about 6 percent higher than for non-whites in 1976.
Our estimated coefficient on race for 1976 implies that non-whites
earn about 4 percent more than whites after controlling for other

variables. But non-whites work fewer weeks than whites in each year,
as shown in Table 6. Using these differences, the effect of fewer
weeks worked per year on non-white wages would be about 1.3 percent in
1976, according to the estimated coefficients on experience in that year.
We also find that while part-time workers do not receive lower
wages than full-time workers immediately after graduation, they do a

-65-

few years later. By 1976, part-time workers were earning 15 percent
less per hour than those working full-time. It is likely that part-time
jobs are less likely to be characterized by ladder movement and associated

wage increases than full-time ones. This may not affect initial wage
rates much, but would after some time when many full-time workers would
have moved up the ladder.

We experimented with several regional and residential location vari-

ables. Only a rural indicator and an indicator for the western region
are included in the specification shown. After controlling for an average state wage measure, none of the other controls for aggregate market
conditions affected youth wages.

We will not coment on the "non-school attendance" estimates in
Table 8B. They are essentially comparable to those in Table 7B, that
were discussed above.

At the bottom of Table 8B, however, are shown the estimates of the
correlations between the wage rate and non-school attendance disturb-

ances. As in the weeks worked results, we find a positive correlation
between unmeasured determinants of school attendance and the disturbances in the wage rate equations, although the relevant correlations are

much smaller. Thus, according to our results, persons who go to school
if they were working would earn more than those who in fact elect to work,
even if the two groups of individuals had the same measured characteristics.
The estimated correlation is .21 in 1972 and then rises to .36 in 1973.

After that, they decline rather evenly to .19 in 1976. It is reasonable
to expect them to decline as more and more persons enter the labor force
after having been in school for one or more years.

III. The Persistence of Early Labor Force Experience
Early labor force experience may be related to later experience
for at least four reasons:

(1) Measured attributes of individuals are

similar from period to period. For example, we have found that persons
from wealthy families earn more per hour than those from poor families.
And that persons with higher academic aptitude or measured achievement

comand higher wage rates than those with lower scores.

(2) Some

unmeasured attributes of individuals persist over time and are related

to labor force experience. This reason is often referred to as heterogeneity. How much youth are helped by their families, for example, or
difficult to define characteristics like motivation may fall into this

category. (3) Random factors that affect labor force experience,
although not constant over time, may be related from one time period to

the next. The fortunes or misfortunes of a large firm in a small town
may be an example.

(4) Finally, labor force experience due to random

occurrences or shifts in exogenous variables in one period may affect

outcomes in later periods. This possibility is often referred to as
state dependence.37

The first we have analyzed in Section II. The last three are the
subject of this section, although we will not be able to distinguish

each of them from all of the others. Our analysis will concentrate on
inferences that can be drawn from relationships among the disturbance
terms in the wage equations, and from relationships among nominal weeks

worked as well as disturbances from the weeks worked equations. Because
we have estimated weeks worked and wage equations separately for each
year, and because we have obtained wage equation estimates allowing for

—71—

sample selection and weeks worked equations allowing for both sample
selection and a limit of 52 weeks, it is cumbersome to estimate unconditional correlations among the population disturbances -— as specified

in equations (1) and (5), for example. It is not straightforward to use
the residuals because the independent variable is observed only for
persons not in school and in the case of weeks worked because the inde-

pendent variable is limited. For simplicity we will limit our discussion
to the relationships over time, conditional on being in the labor force.
This allows a rather straightforward variance components description of

the structure of the correlations among the wage disturbances. We will
consider them first. In addition to the variance components decomposition, we have used another method to describe the relationships among
weeks worked over time, we will consider them second.

38

For the wage rate disturbances we will be able to distinguish. per-

sistence over time due to heterogeneity from that caused by the last two

reasons listed above. But we will not formally be able to distinguish
the third from the fourth; that is, serial correlation from state

dependence as they are interpreted here. What will show up as serial
correlation in our analysis could result from what we would like to

distinguish as state dependence. But we will be able to say something
about the possible magnitude of a state dependence effect. Because our
analysis relies primarily on inferences based on the estimated correlations
(or covariances) among the disturbances, we will not give much attention
to the subsequent effects of changes in labor force experience due to
shifts in exogenous variables in earlier periods (included under our
fourth reason).39

—72—

Although subsequent analysis will use estimated covariance terms,
it is informative to look first at estimates of the correlations between
the disturbances in the wage equations.4° They are reproduced below,
together with a correlation matrix of the logarithm of nominal wages.4'

The pattern of correlations suggests that unmeasured influences on
wage rates are to a large degree temporary ones that do not persist from

early to later years. The correlation between the first and the fifth
wage disturbances is only .282. The correlations also suggest increasing consistency over time. For example, the correlation between the
first and second disturbance is .538; but .727 between the fourth and the
fifth.

The correlations drop rapidly with increases in the time inter-

val between periods. This can be seen by a glance at the last row of

-73-

the correlation matrix, where the correlations between the last year's
disturbance and those for prior years are recorded. Whatever the cause
of the observed persistence, it declines rapidly over time to a floor
of about .3 (that we will see in a moment can be attributed to per-

sistent individual specific characteristics.) A casual comparison of
the correlations suggests that the effect of individual specific

characteristics on wage rates is dominated by random components

that are serially correlated. We shall be more precise about that.
Suppose that the wage equation disturbances can be decomposed into

individual specific and random terms. Let each disturbance be written as
=

+

u

where u is an individual specific term, presumed to persist over the

period of our data, and e is a random term. Suppose that the variance
of u over individuals is

and the variance of e, allowed to differ

from period to period, is given by a. Also, assume that the terms

follow a first order auto regressive process. Then the variances among
the disturbances can be written as:

We

have estimates of the

based on residuals from the equations

estimated above. Using a maximum likelihood procedure, we fitted these
estimates to the specification just described. That is, we estimated
p,

...,

a.42 There

are several special cases of this more

general model. We shall mention two. One is obtained by supposing that
the random components are not serially correlated, so that p is zero.

(This would of course rule out state dependence.) In this case, all the
covariances would be equal. The corresponding correlations would be the
same, except to the extent that the variances of the random terms differ.
The second constrains

to be zero; it rules out heterogeneity. Then

the correlations between disturbances one period apart are given by

pV/
/2t+l
t

, and for two periods apart by p2/Y/ 1a2
t

,

etc...

If

t+2

the random term variances are equal, the correlations become p, p2, etc...
Estimates of the components of variance for the wage disturbances,
based on the unconstrained model ,

are

recorded below.

k. These are asymptotic standard errors based on the maximum likelihood estimation procedure and the associated information matrix. They
should be considered only as illustrative. A more efficient, and consistent, procedure would take account of the variance-covariance matrix
of the initial covariance matrix estimates. Such a procedure is described
in Hausman and Wise [1978]. Because our original sample is so large,
we suspect that the marginal gains from using this procedure would not
be great.

—76—

They suggest the same general conclusions as those based on the unconstrained model ,

although we reject the hypothesis of equal variances.

It is clear that both individual specific and random terms are important

determinants of variance. These estimates suggest that between 23 and
27 percent of the error variances can be ascribed to individual specific

characteristics that persist over the five time periods. The bulk of
the variance, however, remains in the additive random terms. Those
random terms are correlated over time. The estimated serial correlation
coefficient in the unconstrained model is .454. We conclude that whatever the cause of this correlation over time, its effect is not lasting.
The estimated effect of serial correlation on the aggregate correlations

in the matrix above declines rapidly. Ignoring differences in random
term variances, without the individual specific terms the estimated correlations between the disturbances one, two, three, and four periods

apart would be .454, .206, .094, and .042 respectively.43
Thus we conclude that whatever causal effect there may be of early
wage rate experience on later wage rates, it does not last very long;
it is essentially absent after four or five years.

The correlations among the weeks worked disturbances for persons

not in school are shown in the first tabulation below. The correlations
among nominal weeks worked are shown in the second.

For comparison with the results for the wage disturbances, we fit
the same variance components specification to the weeks worked residual

The estimates are quite similar to those pertaining to the wage disturbances, although the proportion of variance due to individual specific

As with the wage disturbances, without individual specific terms, the

correlations among the errors would be quite small. Ignoring differences in random term variances, the implied correlations one, two, and

three periods apart are .343, .118, and .040 respectively. Thus,
whatever the reasons for the correlation over time --

including

a possi-

-78-

ble state dependence effect --

it

is not lasting. These results based

on weeks worked residuals are similar to those obtained for wage disturbances.

But in this case, the disturbances, like nominal weeks worked,

are limited by the upper bound on total weeks worked. In practice, the
estimated correlations are not affected much by the truncation of weeks

worked. Correlation matrices of nominal weeks worked, and of weeks
worked disturbances, based only on observations with weeks worked less

than 52 are very close to those presented above. Nonetheless we found
it more informative to describe relationships among weeks worked through
a series of transition matrices, than to describe the relationship by

an estimated components of variance structure. Our procedure was the
following.

For each year we classified weeks worked into four intervals:

O to 20, 21 to 40, 41 to 51, and 52. For each pair of years we calcu—
lated the transition probabilities of moving from an interval in the
earlier year to each of the intervals in the second year. They are

presented in Table 9, with the entries shown as percents. For example,
the matrix headed 1nl974_75 in the middle of the table says that 71
percent of the persons who worked 52 weeks in 1974 also worked 52 weeks
in 1975; 4 percent worked between 0 and 20 weeks. The numbers below
and to the left of each matrix are marginal proportions (percents).
All entries have been rounded to the nearest percent.
The table can also be used to calculate for each pair of years

the joint probability of each of the interval combinations.

For

example, the matrix headed "1973-76" in the lower left of the table
says that 1 percent of the 892 persons who were not in school in both
1973 and 1976 worked less than 20 weeks in each of those years (13 percent of 8 percent).

Recall that some persistence over time is due to measured attributes

of individuals that are similar from one period to the next. The slightly
higher correlations among annual weeks worked than among the weeks worked

residuals reflects the effect of these variables. It can be seen from
the matrices above, however, that this difference is small.

Only a small

proportion of the variance in weeks worked is explained by measured mdi-

vidual attributes. The transition matrices in Table 9 present a blowup
of the information contained in the nominal weeks worked correlation

matrix. Thus persistence is somewhat higher than that due to unobserved
components alone, but not much.

The transition matrices reveal several phenomena. The upper bound
on weeks worked is reflected in the large probabilities of remaining in
the 52-week "interval" from one period to the next, much larger than

for any other interval. This is apparently because many persons who
work 52 weeks are indeed constrained by this limit. Any who "would work"
52 weeks or more are observed to remain at the limit. Even persons
observed to work 52 weeks in one year may still be at 52 weeks in the
second even if their "unobserved propensity" to work declined between

the two time periods. From the diagonal matrices it can be seen that
those who remain at the limit for consecutive years increases from 62
percent between the first and the second to 83 percent between the third

-81-

and the fourth.

Persistence in general increases over time, as can be seen from a

comparison of the diagonal elements of the three diagonal matrices. For
example, 30 percent of persons who are in the lowest interval in the

first year are also in that interval in the second. But 50 percent who
are in this interval in the third year are also there in the fourth.
Apparently individual patterns become increasingly established.
While experience in the fourth year seems strongly related to that
in the third, the relationship between experience in the last year and
earlier years declines rapidly with increasingly distant time periods.
This pattern can be seen best by looking at the last row of matrices in
in 1976. Of persons in the four intervals in 1975; 50, 12, 3, and 1 per-

cent respectively are in the lowest interval in 1976. Of persons in the
four intervals in 1973, the corresponding percents are 13, 13, 4, and 5.

Whereas the likelihood that a person who was in the lowest interval in
1975 was also there in 1976 was 50 times as high as if he worked 52

weeks in 1975; if he were in the lowest interval in 1973, the likelihood of being in the lowest interval in 1976 was only about 2.5 times

as high as if he had worked 52 weeks in 1973. These numbers are consistent with the simple correlations among weeks worked.
The numbers of persons who remain in the lowest intervals also can
be inferred directly from Table 9.

For example, 1 percent of persons

who were not in school in both the first and the last year worked 20
weeks or less in each of the years.

We conclude, as with wage rates, that whatever the determinants of
weeks worked, they do not for the most part persist over these four

-82-

years. Recall that a small part of the relationship seen in the transition matrices is due to measured individual attributes. They are not
distinguished in the matrices from unmeasured individual attributes,
individual specific terms, commonly referred to as representing hetero-

geneity. Both measured and unmeasured individual specific characteristics
oroduce some persistence over time. (The proportion of the residual
variance due to individual specific terms, implied by the "residual"

covariance matrix, was presented above.) The remainder of the relationship over time may be due to a true state dependence effect or to
serial correlation induced by correlation over time of other factors

that affect weeks worked. Whatever the reason, however, there seems to
be very little room for a state dependence effect of labor force

experience in the first year on experience in the last. Any effect
there may be dies out rapidly.

As youngsters age their patterns of labor force experience become
increasingly stable, as we might expect to find among persons moving

from full-time school to full—time work, a process that is likely to
involve considerable searching, job changing, and the like before
settling into more or less permanent employment. 46

Unmeasured determinants of wage rates in the early periods show
little relationship to unmeasured determinants in later years. Unmeasured determinants of weeks worked in the earliest period show

little relationship to those in the last. There is, however, a
dependence between the two. As shown in Table 8A, experience in
earlier years does affect wage rates in later years. 47

IV. Summary and Conclusion
We have used the National Longitudinal Study of 1972 High School

Seniors to analyze the relationship between high school preparation
and other personal characteristics on the one hand and early labor
force experience on the other.

In general, the data do not suggest to us severe employment pro-

blems for this sample of high school graduates. There are very few
persons who are chronically out of school and unemployed. Estimated
unemployment rates are moderate and employment ratios high. The implications that we draw from these data are at variance with those based on
the Current Population Survey data, that suggest substantially higher
unemployment rates for high school graduates and considerably lower
employment ratios.

Average wage rates of employed whites and non-whites who are not

in school are very similar. Wage equation estimates reveal that after
controlling for other variables, non-whites earn slightly more per hour

than whites. But average weeks worked per year are less for non-whites
than whites although annual weeks worked equations that control for

other variables indicate that non-whites are employed about as many

weeks per year as whites with similar characteristics. At the same
time, non-whites are more likely than whites to be in school; controlling for other variables, the probability of being in school is at
least .10 higher for non-whites in each of five periods covering four
post-high school years.

-84-

Although traditional measures of academic success -test scores and class rank --

are

standardized

related to employment and wage rates

following high school, measures of vocational and industrial training

are not. Training presumably directed toward job related tasks does
not enhance post-high school labor force experience, but attributes
associated with traditional measures of academic success do.
Hours of work while in high school are very strongly related to weeks
worked in particular and also to wage rates in each of the four years

following graduation. An additional five hours of work per week in high
school, at least up to 20, is associated with as much as 1.5 more weeks

worked per year in each of the four post-high school years. The
evidence suggests that this is due to individual attributes associated
with working while in high school; these attributes may or may not be

developed by this experience. Together with the effect on the hourly
wage rate, the effect on earnings is quite substantial. This suggests
to us that training only, without the attributes associated with work
effort and or doing well in school, will not increase one's chances in

the labor force. On the other hand, on-the-job training after high
school is associated with higher wage rates. Possibly none of these
findings should be especially surprising. They reinforce the oftmentioned claim that ill-defined attributes associated with working
hard and "doing well", maybe the work ethic, are important determinants

of labor force "success". This idea seems to come through strongly in
our statistical results.

The results should not be interpreted to mean that vocational

training will not help persons do jobs better. It seems to us more

-85-

likely that the kinds of training in current high school curricula does

not. On-the-job training, for example, does have a significant effect
on later wage rates. This is of course training combined with work.
We were unable to distinguish training in vocational high schools from

training in other high schools. Vocational high schools may provide
better training and attract different kinds of students. More detailed
investigation could reveal particular types of students for whom high
school vocational training does enhance subsequent labor force exper-

iences. We will pursue both of these possibilities in future research.
It may also be that selection and tracking mechanisms in high school
channel those least likely to succeed, either in or out of school,

into non-academic courses. Our results, however, are conditional on
test scores and class rank, both coniion measures of high school performance.

Finally, we addressed the question of persistence over time of early

labor force experience. An important question is whether or not early
realized experience itself, after controlling for individual characteris-

tics of persons, has an effect on later experience. Is there a "state
dependence1' effect? Our analysis suggests that if there is such an

effect, it does not last long. There seems to be almost no relationship
of this kind between weeks worked during the first year after high school

graduation and weeks worked four years later. That is, we find no relationship other than that due to individual specific attributes. And
random fluctuations in wage rates in the first year or two, resulting
from non-individual specific attributes, have almost no relationship

to wages three or four years later. Thus our findings do not motivate
or increase concern that there may be something intrinsically damaging

-86-

about particular kinds of early labor force experience. After controlling for measured characteristics of individuals, we cannot identify
a lasting effect of initial realized employment on later employment or

of initial realized wage rates on later wage rates. We do find, however, that early weeks worked have an effect on wage rates; but even
this effect may be rather small after four years.

Although early random fluctuations in weeks worked have little
effect on later weeks worked and early random fluctuations in wages
little effect on later wages, our results show a distinct trend of
greater consistency between one year and the next as persons age.
Employment patterns in the third year, for example, are much more likely to carry over to the fourth than are first year patterns to carry

over to the second. We find a concomitant increasing wage penalty
associated with part-time work, as persons age.

Along with the lasting relationship between high school work
experience and later wage rates, as well as employment, we find that
the effect of weeks worked in the first year after graduation has a
substantial effect on wage rates in subsequent years, although the
effect may decline over time.
There are three distinct findings here and we will put them all

together. One, the estimated 'effects" of high school work experience on weeks worked and wage rates after high school are about the

same over the four post-high school years. Two, the effect of early
post-high school weeks worked on wage rates in subsequent years is

substantial but may decline over time, with weeks worked in the most
recent year being more important than experience in earlier years in

-87--

the determination of current wages. Three, we find no lasting effect
of non-individual specific random disturbances in early post-high

school weeks worked on weeks worked in later years. And there is no
lasting effect of non—individual specific random disturbances in initial

wage rates on later wages. Although weeks worked in early years have an
effect on later wage rates, as the second finding describes.

Thus our findings suggest, albeit indirectly, that to prepare
persons for the labor force, programs that emphasize work experience

for youth may be the most likely to succeed. And indirectly, that the
concern that low-level or dead-end jobs will hinder subsequent labor

market performance is likely to be misplaced. Even though we cannot
be sure that the characteristics of those who now work in high school

will be gained by those who don't, should future generations of them
be got to work, the weight of our evidence is that it offers the best

chance of enhancing future labor market experience. Certainly our
evidence suggests that it should be given precedence over specific

job training in high school. If there is a second priority, our
evidence suggests that general academic preparation has a greater
payoff than current high school vocational training as well.

where small y. is observed weeks worked and capital Y. is the unobserved
propensity to work and p is the correlation between

There are three possibilities: Individual i is in school so that
Si <

0; he is not in school and is working less than 52 weeks so that

S. > 0 and y. is observed with y. <

52; he is not in school and is work-

ing 52 weeks so that S1 > 0 and y = 52.

The probabilities of these

this derivative is

in our sample since [52/a] is close to 1. It

is informative to evaluate the derivative b at say the mean of X.

In our sample, E(yIX) is about 43 weeks. Thus the derivative of y at

this point gives a reasonable indication of the effect of a change in

an X value, when y is approaching its maximum. Finally, to obtain the
effect of a change in an X value on y for persons who elect not to go
to school, the derivative c may be used.

The wage specification prescribes only two possible outcomes,

analogous to the first two presented above for weeks worked. An individual
is either not in the sample with a measured wage ("in school") so that
S1 <

0; or is not in school and has an observed wage, Si > 0

and W.

is observed. These probabilities are given by:

FOOTNOTES

1. For more detail, see Levinsohn et al. [1978].

2. The number is in fact .068.
3. In Appendix Table B, we have presented an example of estimates

for persons in school. For some parameter estimates, differences between
the two groups are substantial.

4. We can give a behavioral interpretation to this model by supposing
that in each year t each individual attaches some value U0 to going to

school and some value U1 to staying out of school. The values may depend,
for example, on the expected effect of each of the choices on future

earnings. Suppose that both

and U1 depend on individual characteris-

tics z, and random terms e so that U0 =

ztbto

+

e0

and U1 =

ztbti

Then assume that the no-school alternative is chosen if U1 U.0

is greater than zero. If we define St =

we can attach a random choice

model interpretation to the specifications defined in equations (3), (4)
and (5), with the individual profit specifications interpreted as yielding

reduced form parameter estimates. This is similar to the more elaborate
specification used by Willis and Rosen [1978].

6. A maximum likelihood method for doing this is laid out by
Hausman and Wise [1977].

7. We have not considered hours worked per week.
8. The expected value of weeks worked is given by, E(y) = Pr(Y>52)
•52

+ Pr(Y<52)E(YY<52).
9. This could be done by estimating the four weeks worked equations

jointly with the four sample selection equations. Such a procedure would
also yield estimates of the correlations among the random terms in equations

(2) and (5). But it also presents substantial computational complexity.
10. Even though we have used only a subsample of the whole data set,
to

get a given number with "good weeks worked data, we have to have a

much larger total sample

size if only persons never in school are con-

sidered to have observations on the

y.

11. By forming for example the appropriate inverse Mills ratio and
entering it as a variable in each of the weeks worked equations.
12.

It may be technically inconsistent to use weeks worked while at

the same time using the logarithm of wages, since earning is usually

assumed to be lognormal. That is,
E = Y•H•W, and mE = lnY +

lnH + lnW,

where E is annual earnings, H is hours per week, and W is the hourly wage

rate. But since our weeks worked results suggest a slightly better fit
using weeks rather than their logarithms, we have reported these results.

13. We predicted the conditional expectation of S1, S2, and S3,
given that a person was in the sample. We also predicted the sum of the
schooling variables, conditional upon being in the sample.

-101-

14. Griliches, Hall, and Hausinan [1978], found that corrections for
the endogeneity of schooling increased the coefficient for schooling in

their wage equation, even after correcting for sample selection. Our
attempts to instrument schooling suggested, however, that the schooling
coefficients in our model may be biased upward.

15. We experimented with two approaches. One was to include in
the no-wage group all persons without a wage, whether they were students

or unemployed non-students. The status equations in this case are
simply sample selection equations; they cannot be interpreted as school

attendance equations. The other approach was to eliminate altogether
from consideration non-students who were also unemployed in the October

period being considered. The status equations may again be interpreted
as school attendance equations, but the wage equation estimates are
biased to the extent that they are affected by the elimination of

unemployed non-students. In practice, the two procedures led to very
similar wage equation estimates. (In fact, even the estimates in the
status equations were affected very little by the selection procedure

used.) The results reported below were based on the second method.

16. This is consistent with the findings of Freeman [1978] in a
current NBER working paper.

17. The appropriate comparison may be the high school wage versus
the wage with additional schooling -- say a college degree. But the

appropriate high school wage may be local, while the college wage may
reflect a national market.

18. For a detailed discussion of the determinants of college going
behavior, see Manski and Wise [1978], Radner and Miller [1975], or Kohn,

-102-

Manski and Mundell [1974]. Work of Manski and Wise currently in progress
suggests that blacks, once admitted to schools, are less likely than
whites to choose four-year colleges, after controlling for SAT scores,

parents income, and other variables.
19. The estimated effects of hours worked in high school are somewhat lower with than without them and the estimated effects of high school

training somewhat lower as well. The school attendance equations estimated with the wage rate equations as shown in Table 8B include these two

variables. Their inclusion in the wage sample selection equation has
little effect on the wage equation parameters.

20. More precisely, the estimates indicate a substantial relationship if hours worked exceed 15.

21. For more details, see Figure 1 and the text discussion of it,
and Appendix A.

22. [(52—X)/a] = [(52-30)/21J] =

c[l.l]

and a is 20. Sigma is close to 20 in each of the four years. For
more details see Appendix A.

23. The other variables included in the regression are: Number
of Siblings 0.01 (0.01), State Wage -1.62 (0.90), State Unemployment
-0.03 (0.38), Rural —1.87 (1.03), Town -1.85 (0.99), Urban -1.88 (0.98),

South -0.19 (1.25), East -1.32 (1.19), West -0.55 (1.38), Test Score
Missing —9.37 (2.76), Class Rank Missing 0.55 (1.18), and Parents'
Income Missing 1.63 (1.05).

24. Griliches [1977], in an analysis of the Parnes National
Longitudinal Survey, as well as National Longitudinal Study data, also
found that work in high school was virtually unrelated to family socioeconomic variables.

-103-

25. At least in the first two years the estimates are not precisely
measured. The state wage may be considered as an instrument for the
individual wage. Possibly it is too weakly related to individual wages
to pick up any labor supply effect that might be present. A more highly
parameterized instrumental variables specification of the model might

yield a different result. One interpretation of our results is that the
higher the "going" wage the less likely are employers to be willing to
fill jobs with youths.

26. Indeed the estimates imply a relationship that is slightly
U-shaped, with hours between 16 and 30 generally associated with
slightly lower wage rates than high school hours of either more than
30 or greater than zero but less than 16.

27. Of course, high school work could enhance one's ability to
learn from later work experience, and thus a decline in the effect
would not necessarily be expected.

28. If the same specification as shown in Table 8A is used, but
with two high school training variables -- one for persons with a high
school degree only, and a second for persons with post-secondary education --

the

results are similar; the relevant coefficients are not

significantly different from zero for either group.

29. We cannot rule out the possibility that family income captures
individual attributes contributing to job performance and associated with
income, although we think this is unlikely having controlled for school

performance and other characteristics. Wise [1975a, 1975b] found that
family background was not related to earnings or performance in a given

corporate job setting, after individual academic and non-academic
characteristics were controlled for.

-104-

30. This is consistent with other estimates of this type. See, for
example, Griliches and Mason [1972] or Hausman and Wise [1972]. A
comparable monthly coefficient in Hausman and Wise, for example, is
.0063, versus our estimate of .0060 in 1976.

31. In fact, the number of October time periods that the person
was in school.

32. We experimented with the instrumental variable approach described in Section II ——

using the expected value of school in a given

year, conditional on being in the labor force in that year. It did
indeed yield lower estimates, but because we were not satisfied with
the procedure in general, we have reported the uncorrected estimates.
In subsequent work, we will set up a more highly specified simultaneous
equations model that allows for the simultaneous determination of school

and work experience, together with a sample selection equation. Such
a system is cumbersome to apply over repeated years when the

para-

meters are estimated separately for each year. Because this was a primary concern of our analysis, we elected to work with a less complicated
specification in this investigation.

33. The increase in salary with experience is generally higher for
white collar workers than for blue collar workers.

34. See, for example, Freeman [l976a].
35.

If there is an endogeneity bias with respect to experience, its

sign is not clear. Because schooling is positively related to the error
in the wage equation, and experience is cumulated only if a person is

not in school, the estimates would tend to be biased downward. On the
other hand, the error in weeks worked is positively related to school

attendance. Experience may also be endogenous in that it may be deter-

-105-

mined in part by past wages and the wage disturbances are correlated
over time.

36. And again, there may be some compounding of results because of
the entry of recent college graduates, in the last time period.

37. Although this terminology is intuitively appealing when there
are discrete distinct states that are not artificial divisions of a

continuous measure, it may be a misnomer here. Still we will stick
with it.

38. A straightforward way to estimate the population covariance is
to obtain joint maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters, includ-

ing a covariance term, for each pair of years. This is expensive when
different

parameters are allowed for each year. An easier and less

expensive procedure is to use estimates for individual years (like ours)

to obtain consistent estimates of the

parameters for each year; and

then to use them in a second maximum likelihood stage toestirnate co-

variances, assuming the means implied by the 's from the first stage.
On the basis of preliminary analysis, however we concluded that these
alternatives would not change the conclusions that we reach on the basis
of covariance estimates conditional on being in the labor force.
These

same alternatives could be used to obtain population co-

variances among the weeks worked disturbances, with the added complication

of the upper limit on weeks. We will pursue

this in subsequent work.

But as with the wage disturbances, we concluded that the substance of our
conclusions would not be changed by a more precise and detailed analysis.

39. For a more detailed analysis of state dependence following a
somewhat different procedure, see Eliwood [this volume]. Related
analysis is also contained in Brown [this volume].

-106-

40. The correlation for any two periods is based on persons who were
in the sample in both periods. The residuals are calculated conditional
on being in the sample (not in school).

41. We also calculated a correlation matrix for the logarithm of
nominal wages based on the sample of persons who had a recorded wage
rate in each period (447 out of 3280 who worked in at least one of the

five periods). The correlations are quite close to those shown here
although the correlations between adjacent years are a bit larger in
the later years -- .811 between 1975 and 1976 --

indicating

somewhat

greater stability after four years than for the sample as a whole. The
correlation between 1972 and 1976 is .319, slightly smaller than the one
shown in the text.

42. Although our procedure is consistent, it is not efficient. A
correct procedure would use a minimum modified x2 procedure analogous

to generalized least squares. Given our purpose and relatively large
sample size, we did not pursue this approach.

43. Recall that if all variation were due to individual specific
terms, correlations over time would be one; they would also be one if
state dependence were extreme so that persons could not "change states".

44. The correlation matrix of weeks worked disturbances is based on
an earlier set of statistical results that are substantially the same as

those reported in Table 7. A correlation matrix based on nominal weeks
worked for persons always in the sample--728 out of 2933 who were not in
school in any of the years--reveals no systematic differences from those
shown here.

45. These conclusions remain unchanged if the matrices are based
only on persons who were not in school in any of the four years.

-107-

46. Relationships like those described in this section hold as
well for persons who were in the labor force in each of the periods,
who had no post-high school training.

47. See greater elaboration on this point in Ellwood [this volume].
