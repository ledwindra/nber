PRODUCTIVITY MEASUREMENT
FOR A DISTRIBUTION FIRM

ABSTRACT

The paper derives a consistent accounting framework for the treatment of inventories

when measuring the productivity of a distribution firm. The average purchase price of an
inventory item during an accounting period must be distinguished from its average selling price
and these two average prices should be distinguished from the corresponding balance sheet prices.

The accounting framework is implemented for a distribution firm which sold 76,000 separate
items. The firm achieved a 9.6 percent per quarter total factor productivity growth rate over 6
quarters.

Introduction

Most industry productivity studies have focused on firms or industries in the manufacturing sector. However, in many countries, the trade sector (which includes both
wholesale and retail trade) has grown faster than the manufacturing sector.1 There are
concerns expressed that this shift from manufacturing to services will slow the overall productivity growth of the economy because it is believed that it is not possible to make large
productivity improvements in the service sector. However, the evidence on the low total
factor productivity of the trade and distribution sector is somewhat inconclusive since it
relies on highly aggregated national accounts data,2
This paper will attempt to cast some light on the above issues by measuring the total
factor productivity of a large appliance parts distributor in Western Canada.3 This firm
keeps detailed data on every inventory transaction for a 21—month period. Thanks to the
cooperation of the owner, these data were made available to us and we were able to build
up a detailed set of economic accounts for seven consecutive quarters starting at the second
quarter of 1988.
In Section 2 below, we develop an accounting framework for inventories which should
be of interest to 1)0th management accountants and national income accountants.4 We find
that the treatment of inventories in a distribution firm is a complex matter: an individual
inventory item transaction could appear as either (i) a sale of final output or (ii) a purchase

of an interniediate input or (iii) a net addition to the firm's inventory stocks or (iv) as a
capital stock component which yields capital services to the firm during the accounting
period under examination.
In Section 3, we extend the accounting framework developed in Section 2 to include
the treatment of noninventory capital stock inputs to the firm, such as furniture and office
equipment, computers and storage space.
Given that we have decomposed the value flows of the distribution firm into price and
quantity components in accordance with the accounting framework explained in Sections 2
and 3, Section 4 considers how exactly the productivity of the firm should be measured. We
follow Diewert [1992] and measure the productivity change of the firm over two consecutive
1 For example, in Canada, the trade sector has increased from 11.5% of GDP in 1971 to 13.5% in 1986;
see Statistics Canada [1988].
2 The problem is that national statistical agencies have not been given the resources to measure service
sector inputs and outputs as accurately as the manufacturing sector.
The firm has outlets in seven locations: Vancouver, Victoria, and Coquitlaxn in British Columbia;
Edmonton and Calgary in Alberta; Saskatoon in Saskatchewan and Winnipeg in Manitoba.
The United Nation's [1968; 110—111] early treatment of inventories or stocks focused on valuing net
changes in stocks held over the period under consideration. The new System of National Accountants
1999, United Nations [1993; 130-133; 217-221; 230-233; 278-286] has a much more satisfactory treatment
of inventories, but since interest is still treated as a transfer payment, the user cost of inventories is not
developed. Historical cost accounting is also deficient in that no allowance for asset inflation is made.

Accounting for Inventories

In this section, we shall assume that the only durable inputs owned by the firm are
inventories; all other durable inputs (such as buildings or computers) are rented or leased.
The period i' cash flow of the fIrm, CFt, is defined as follows:

CFt EIP1ZI + 1PkS, —

(0.1)

where: P > 0 is price for period t of the mth noninventory output (or input) produced
(or used) by the firm; Z is the quantity of the mth noninventory output produced by the

firm if Z > 0 (if Z < 0, then —Z is the quantity of the inth good used as an input
during period t), S, 0 is the quantity of the nth inventory good which is sold by the
firm during period t and P 0 is the corresponding average price; i1c 0 is quantity of
the nth inventory good which is purchased by the firm during period t and P 0 is the
corresponding average price.
At the beginning of the period t, we assume that the only assets held by the firm are
its stocks of inventory items. Of course, end of period stocks of inventories are equal to
the beginning of next period's stocks of inventories. We define At to be the value of the
firm's physical stocks of inventories at the end of the period t. Thus we have:

At 1PJK

(0.2)

where K > 0 is the firm's holdings of the nth inventory good at the end of period t and
P 0 is the corresponding end of period t price. In our empirical work, this price was
taken to be the last purchase price for this good in period t. Thus in situations where
inflation occurs during period t, Pj (the last price paid) will generally be higher than P
(the average purchase price during the period). Of course, the average selling price for
good ii in period t, P, will generally be higher than P, the average purchase price (the
difference P — P, is called the trade margin).
Note that our choice of P as the price of the last purchase price of the nth inventory
good in period t is consistent with the original aim of balance sheet accounting, which was
to give an accurate picture of the value of the firm's assets (and liabilities) at a particular
moment in time (the end of the accounting period). Thus the balance sheet or stock price
Pk will generally be different from the flow prices Pk and P1.
Note that we are attempting to value assets at time t at the relevant opportunity
costs prevailing at the moment of time. Thus our inventory value At is a current cost
asset value and it differs from the traditional accounting historical cost asset value which
values all assets at their historical cost of acquisition. Of course, in periods of moderate
3

or rapid inflation, historical cost asset values do not lead to accurate values of either the
firm's current asset value or current income.
We now turn our attention to the problems involved in defining the distribution firm's
income or profits. Ex post current cost accounting income in period t for our distribution
firm can be defined as period t cash flow plus the end of period t asset value minus the
beginning of period t asset value; i.e. define Alt as follows:

Alt mCFt + At — At_i.

(0.3)

Thus accounting income equals cash flow plus the increment in asset value over the period.
However, accounting income as defined by (3) is not a satisfactory measure of income
or pure profits for an equity financed firm: the problem is that AP neglects the opportunity
cost of capital. Thus we define ex post economic income in period t as

Elt CFt + At — (1 + rt)At_l

(0.4)

where rt is the firm's opportunity cost of capital at the beginning of period t. Thus
economic income is smaller than accounting income by the term rtAt' which is either
the interest cost of borrowing At1 dollars at the beginning of period t for a debt financed
firm or it is the period t interest earnings that are foregone by an equity financed firm by
not lending out its beginning of period t value of assets, At'.
Economic income or pure profits Elt defined by (4) can serve as an objective function
for period t.
Definition (4) is the key to our treatment of inventories. However, before we can spell
out the implications of (4), we need another set of equations which relate the end of period
t stocks of inventory good n, KT, to the corresponding beginning of period t stock, K[1:

(Ii 5

U denotes the number of units of inventory good n that are internally used up or
utilized by the firm during period t.5 This number includes losses due to theft, spoilage
and accidental damage and defects. Note that I — S — U is equal to net additions to
the stock of inventories for good n during period t. Thus equation n in (5) says that the
end of period t stock of good n equals the beginning of period t stock plus net additions
during period t (which could be positive or negative).
Now substitute (1), (2) and (5) into (4) to obtain the following expression for period
t economic income or pure profits:

Some units of inventory good n may be transformed by the firm into units of some other final output,

say. Thus U,, would include these units of transformed good n. In our empirical work, our firm did

Note that o equals an interest cost rjP less capital gains Pk — PJ'. Thus ct is a
discrete time analogue to the continuous time Jorgenson [1963] user cost of capital.6 If all

of the user costs ci are positive, then the last set of terms on the right hand side of (7)
are cost items and K' should be regarded as an input with price equal to c.
The above accounting treatment of inventories is quite different from both the United
Nation's treatment of inventories as well as traditional historical cost accounting treatments.
Before we deal with noninventory assets, it is worth pointing out that maximizing a
discounted stream of economic incomes is equivalent to maximizing a discounted stream of
cash flows. To see this, assume that the firm's starting asset value is A° at the beginning

of period 1 and the firm sells off its assets AT at the end of period T. Then the firm's
discounted stream of market transactions is

EI_A0+(1+rl)_1CF1+(1+rl)_l(1+r2YCF2+...

6 We can obtain closer correspondence to Jorgenson's user cost if we define the depreciation rates
U/K' for n = 1,..., N. Then we may replace U in (7) by 6K' for n = 1,... ,N. After these

replacements, the last two terms in (7) may be rewritten as

and Jorgenson [1969], neglecting the complications due to the taxation of business income.

where (10) follows from (9) using definitions (4). Thus maximizing discounted cash flows
is equivalent to maximizing discounted economic incomes. We turn now to the accounting
treatment of noninventory durable inputs that might be held by the firm.

3.

Accounting for Noninventory Capital Inputs

The accounting framework that we developed in the previous section for inventory
goods can readily be adapted to deal with the firm's purchases of other durable inputs.7
We now assume that our list of N capital inputs includes noninventory durable inputs as
well.

Recall the utilization terms U that occurred in equations (5) above. If capital good n
is a noninventory capital good, then we now interpret U as a combination of the physical
loss of efficiency of the beginning of the period capital stock K,' and the retirement
or scrapping of older units of this initial capital stock that occurred during period t. We
further follow the example of Jorgenson [19631 and Jorgenson and Griliches [1967; 256-257]

and assume that U is a constant fraction 5 of the initial capital stock; i.e., we assume
that
(0.11)

for all noninventory capital goods n. Thus O is the noninventory capital good n depreciation or deterioration rate where 0 O, < 1. If n is a noninventory capital good and
we substitute (11) into the capital accumulation equations (5), we obtain the following
equations:

K=(1—O)K'+I7—S,

(0.12)

where J equals the number of units of capital good ii purchased during period t and S,
equals the number of units sold during period t.8
In order to further simplify the algebra of our model, if good n is a noninventory
capital good, we assume that

= Pj;

PJ =

(0.13)

i.e, the average purchase price for noninventory capital good n in period t, P, is equal
to the average selling price for good n in period t, P, which in turn is equal to the end
of period t asset value for noninventory capital good n, Pk. If good n is a noninventory
capital good and we substitute (11) and (13) into (7), we find that the terms involving
capital good ii simplify as follows:

P S — Pj I + [I — S UJ — [rt P1 — (Pk —

We define a durable input to be an input which is not completely used up in the accounting period
in which it was purchased.
8 Typically, S will equal 0 for a noninventory capital good.

where the period t cx post accounting user cost of capital for noninventory capital good n
is defined as

nt—i
= lrfnt—i
r
Jj + Unfj
— mt —nt—i
— I

Thus if good n is a noninventory durable input, then the four terms involving this good in

the definition of period economic income Elt collapse down to the single term 13K'
under the simplifying assumptions (11) and (13). The user cost of capital for good n,8, is

made up three terms: (i) the interest cost rtP'; (ii) the depreciation cost 6P and (iii) a
minus capital gains term, —(PJ — Pr'). This is analogous to the Jorgenson and Griliches

[1967; 256] continuous time user cost of capital and is in fact equal to the Christensen
and Jorgenson [19691 discrete time user cost of capital (neglecting the complications due
to business income taxation).
It should be noted that our treatment of noninventory capital inputs follows the
net capital methodology pioneered by Jorgenson and Griliches [1967; 256] as opposed
to the gross capital methodology used by many statistical agencies. In the net capital
methodology, the quantity of capital services supplied by older units of capital is reduced
by depreciation and the user costs associated with all vintages of capital in use during
a given period remain constant; in a correct gross capital methodology, the quantity of
capital services supplied by an older unit of capital remains equal to its initial installed
capacity until it is retirccl but the user costs of older units of capital would be less than
the user costs of younger units due to the decline in asset value which occurs as the capital
good ages.
To summarize this section and the previous section, we note that the decomposition of
income in period t given by (7) into price and quantity components forms the basis for our
productivity computations, with the understanding that the simplification given by (14)
occurs if capital good n is a noninventory durable input. We treated inventories differently

from other capital inputs because price information on the three price series P, PL and
P is readily available from firm records. For other capital inputs, information on these
three types of prices is not available from firm records due to the infrequent nature of
noninventory capital input purchases. Thus for noninventory capital inputs, we are forced
to make the simplifying assumptions in (13) and we obtain the required information on
P by using relevant price indexes from government statistical agencies.9
4.
Productivity Indexes
Rewrite economic income in period t, given by (7) above, as follows:

Elt =t.1/ _wt.xt, t= 1,2,...,T,

(0.16)

We are also required to make educated guesses as to the magnitudes of the noninventory depreciation
rates 6,,.

where p and w are positive price vectors, y is a net output vector, x is a positive
vector of labor and capital inputs used by the firm in period t and p .
denotes the inner product of the vectors pt and y. The y vector contains the outputs

E' i'i

produced by the firm in period t (these components of y have positive signs) and the
intermediate inputs used by the firm in period t (these components have a negative sign).
Thus components of y consist of the S,1L (sales of inventory items), the I — S — U, (net
additions to inventory stocks which could be positive or negative), the terms —U (minus
purchases of inventories), and other terms Z (minus purchases of business services and
minus purchases of shipping services). The components of the x vector consist of the
K, (initial stocks of inventories and other capital inputs which are furniture and fixtures,
computers and buildings) and one Z (manhours utilized during period t). The prices
which correspond to these quantities can be determined by inspecting equations (7) and
(14).

An index of the productivity going from period t — 1 to period t can be defined as a

(net) output index divided by an input index; i.e., we define productivity in period t to
be:

PRODt QF(pt_l .
where QE and Q

are

(0.19)

For justifications for the use of the Fisher ideal index number formula in (17), see Diewert
[1992].

The firm whose productivity performance we will examine in the next section has
76,000 separate inventory items that it sells to customers. Since all inventory items appear
three times in the y vectors and once in the x vectors, it can be seen that the computation
of the inner products in (18) and (19) is not trivial. To simplify our computations, we
used a two stage procedure. In the first stage, we constructed separate Fisher chain price
and quantity indexes for: (i) sales of inventories; (ii) purchases of inventories; (iii) net
additions to the stocks of inventories held; and (iv) capital utilization of beginning of
the period stocks of inventories held. In the second stage, we aggregated the first three
inventory aggregates with business services and shipping services using the Fisher ideal
index number formula where each price and quantity vector now has only five components.
We also aggregated the aggregate capital stock of inventories with labor, computer capital,
furniture and fixtures capital, and buildings capital using the Fisher formula where each

8

price and quantity vector had oniy five components in this second stage of our input
aggregation procedure.10

A further complication must be mentioned. In our data set, about 10 to 20 percent
of the inventory items were either not purchased or not sold in consecutive quarters. Thus
the following question arises: should we simply use the Fisher formulae (18) and (19)
with zero prices' aid quantities inserted into the formulae for the goods that were not
transacted in the periods under consideration? This problem is formally analogous to the
new good problem where a new good or service appears in one period but not the prior
period. A valid theoretical approach to the new good problem was originally suggested
by Hicks [1940; 1141:11 in periods when the new good was not available, set the quantity
equal to zero and estimate a reservation price that would rationalize the zero demand or
supply of the good. This same approach could be applied to the problem of infrequently
transacted goods. However a practical objective to this solution to the problem is that
it is difficult to estimate these reservation prices. Thus we followed the procedure that
was recommended by Diewert [1980; 5001: we calculated the Fisher price index (which
has the same functional form as the Fisher quantity index except that the role of prices
and quantities is reversed) for each of our four inventory aggregates, except that we used
price and quantity information on only those goods which were transacted in both periods.
Once these restricted price indexes were constructed, the corresponding quantity indexes
were defined to be the value ratios for goods in the aggregate under consideration divided
by the corresponding rest i'icted prices iiidexes.12 The restricted price index procedure that
we have just described is the one used in the econometric computer package SHAZAM;
see White [1978.
We turn now to a description of our empirical results.

5.

Empirical Results

The data cover seven consecutive quarters starting at the second quarter of 1988. The
firm's data on inventory holdings, sales and purchases are stored only for 21 consecutive
months, so this was the longest period for which we could obtain data.
We distinguish five classes of net outputs: (i) sales of inventory items (SI); (ii) net
additions to the stocks of inventories (Al); (iii) purchases of business services (MB); (iv)
10 Using the results in Diewert [1978; 8901, it can be shown that Fisher quantity indexes using a two
stage aggregation procedure will approximate single stage Fisher quantity indexes to the second order.
See also Fisher and Shell [1972; 22-26] and Diewert [1980; 501-503].
12

Our procedure can be related to reservation prices. For example, in (18), if the first good was
not traded in period t — 1, the Hicksian reservation price p1 should somehow be estimated. Diewert
[1980; 500] shows that our suggested restricted price index procedure will be theoretically correct if
= . yt/ptl .
Thus the index number bias in our restricted procedure will be zero if the
reservation price p' is such that the relative change in the price of good 1 over the two periods, p1/pr"
is equal to the general chang' in prices for th aggregate by the Paasche price index, p . yt/pt1 . yt.

purchases of shipping services (MS); and (v) purchases of inventory items for resale (MI).
The quantities of the last three net outputs are indexed with a negative sign, since they are
intermediate inputs. Net additions to inventory stocks was an output except for quarters
2 and 3, when inventory stocks were drawn down (and hence QAI has a negative sign for
these two quarters). All prices were normalized to equal 1 in the first quarter and hence
the corresponding quantities are measured in millions of constant first quarter dollars. As

explained above, net outputs (i), (ii) and (v) are aggregates of 76,000 inventory items
which were constructed using the restricted Fisher price index methodology explained in
the previous section.
Business services that were purchased included items such as telephones services
(about 30 percent of the total cost of business services), advertising and other utilities.
The price index used to deflate the cost of business services was a weighted average of the
all items Vancouver consumer price index and a British Columbia long distance telephone
price index.13
The shipping services quantity was set equal to the number of invoices which were

either delivered or picked up. The price series was derived by dividing the total cost of
shipping expenses and postage by the number of invoices. We note that smaller customers
did not qualify for free delivery so that shipping costs were a rather small fraction of total
costs.

The quantities of the five classes of ne outputs are listed in Table 1 and the corresponding prices are listed in Table 2.
We distinguish five classes of inputs: (i) labor services (L); (ii) stocks of inventories
held at the beginning of each period (NI); (iii) furniture and fixtures capital input (KF);
(iv) computer hardware and software input (KC); and (v) rentals and holdings of buildings
(KB). The quantity of labor services is measured in person hours14 and the corresponding
wage rate includes fringe benefits. The hourly wage rate in quarter 1 was $12.87. The
inventory capital stocks are Fisher aggregates of the 76,000 inventory items and the user
costs a defined by (8) were used as price weights. The interest rate series used was the
Statistics Canada series for prime business loans, which increased quite rapidly over the
time period under consideration. For inputs (iii) and (iv), the user costs p defined by
(15) were used as price weights. The starting values for the quantities of these two capital
stock components were taken to be the corresponding book values. The price index used
for (iii) was the Vancouver price index for furniture and fixtures (from Statistics Canada)
and the depreciation rate was chosen to be .05. The price index used for (iv) was taken to
13 The Vancouver all items CPI series was 1.000, 1.009, 1.017, 1.029, 1.040, 1.057, and 1.068; the B.C.
telephone price index series was 1.000, .951, 936, .789, .777, .777 and .764. The weight given to the
telephone series was: .3. The source was Statistics Canada.

be the constant 1 since the computer hardware did not change over this time period. The
depreciation rate for computers was chosen to be .30. The starting user cost for furniture
and fixtures turned out to be .1775 and the first period user cost for computers turned
out to be .4025. All price and quantity series for primary inputs were renormalized so
that period 1 prices equaled unity. Wit Ii respect to buildings, of the seven branches, the
company owned the land and buildings in four locations and rented in the other three.
However, in all four locations which were owned, the firm rented out portions of the
buildings to other tenants, and these market rental rates were used as price weights for the
number of square feet of space used by lie firm. In period 1, the average rental rate that
the firm faced was only $.133 per square foot. In period 4, when the head office moved
to Coquitlam, the average rental rate dropped to $.83 per square foot. The quantity and
price information for the five classes of primary input are listed below in Tables 3 and 4.

We now calculate the chained Fisher net output indexes using the data in Tables 1
and 2: define the period t net output growth index YGt by

YCt 2Qp(pt_l,pt,y,Yt) for t=2,3,...,7.

The aggregate output growth series YG is tabled in Table 5 along with the period to

QAIt/QAItl, MBGt QMBLIQMBt_l, MSGt QMSt/QMSt_l, and
MICt QMt/QMIt_l for t = 2,3,... ,7. We note that it is difficult to interpret AIGt
for t = 2 and 4 since QAIt changes sign for those two quarters. Sample averages are also
included in Table 5.
Define the chained Fisher primary input indexes using the data listed in Tables 3 and

Finally, we calculate: (i) value added in period t, VA Pt y where p and y are
the period t price and quantity vectors obtained from Tables 2 and 1; (ii) cost in period t,
x where w and x are the period t price and quantity vectors obtained from
COSTt
Tables 4 and 3; (iii) profits or economic income in period t, PROFITt VA — COSTL;
and (iv) productivity in period t, PRODt YGt/XGt for t = 2, 3,... , T. These series
listed in Table 7.
Profits grew 19 fold over the seven quarters, value added doubled and costs grew
only 18 percent over the period. The average of the quarterly productivity growth rates
was 1.094, that is, on average, productivity grew at the remarkable quarterly rate of 9.4
percent. A closer examination of the data shows that most of the productivity growth

took place going from period 1 to period 2 (a 33 percent increase) and from quarter 3 to
quarter 4 (a 21 percent increase). The explanation for these large growth rates can be
seen if we examine Table 7: value added increased by 39 percent going from quarter 1
to 2 and by 31 percent going from quarter 3 to 4. This first increase in value added can
be explained by the sharp decline in purchases of inventories going from quarter 1 to 2
and by the large additions to inventory stocks going from quarter 3 to quarter 4 (when
the head office moved to new and more spacious quarters). The rather uneven rates of
growth in purchases of inventories reflect the nature of a large distribution firm. Generally,
these types of firms make large purchases to obtain volume discounts and then specialize
in having low holding costs.
6.
Conclusion
Our main conclusion is that large productivity gains are possible in the distribution
sector of an economy. These productivity gains are made possible by the computer revolution which allows a firm to track accurately its purchases and sales of inventory items and
to use the latest computer software to minimize inventory holding costs. In our empirical
example, which used the data pertaining to a large appliance distributorship in Western
Canada, we found that the average total factor productivity growth rate over six quarters
13

was an amazing 9.4 percent per quarter. The average quarterly growth rate for inventory
sales was 11.1 percent while the average quarterly growth rate for inventory purchases was
only 2.8 percent and the average growth rate for inventory stocks held was —.9 percent.
Thus our distribution clearly economized on its holdings of inventories relative to its sales
of inventory items.
Our empirical results appear to contradict recent research on the behaviour of inventories from a macroeconomic perspective as the following quotation indicates:
Furthermore, contrary to popular belief, inventories are not leaner now than they
were decades ago. Despite the alleged revolution in inventory practices brought
about by computerization, the economy-wide ratio of real inventories to real sales
has been trendless for 40 years.
(Blinder and Maccini [1991; 75])

How can the above macroeconomic "facts" be reconciled without microeconomic
"facts"? A possible explanation is that the number of commodities that are sold on
world market has been dramatically expanding in recent years. For example, from 1984
to 1990, the number of standard chemical products that are carried by a leading chemical supply company15 for immediate delivery has risen from 16,000 products to 27,000
products. Each new product requires a separate inventory. Hence if computer induced
inventory economics were not occurring at the micro firm level, we would expect macro
inventory stocks to be growing faster than sales if new products were being introduced
into the economy on a widespread basis. Thus the above macro "facts" can be reconciled
with the microeconomic results that we obtained, if there was a widespread proliferation
of new products into the world economy during the past 40 years (which we believe has
taken place).

15 The company is Aldrick Chemical Company [1984] [1990]. In addition to its standard chemical
products listed in its main catalogues, this company offered an additional 23,000 rare chemicals in 1984
and an additional 33,000 rare chemicals in 1990. In both 1984 and 1990, the company stated that
approximately 4,000 of its standard chemical products were new.
