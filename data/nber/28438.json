    "abstract": "\n\nWhat utility notion\u2014e.g., flow/lifetime, self/family-centered\u2014do self-reported well-being (SWB) questions measure? Existing applications make different assumptions regarding the (i) life domains, (ii) time horizons, and (iii) other-regarding preferences captured by SWB data. To obtain relevant evidence, we ask survey respondents what they had in mind regarding (i)\u2013(iii) when answering commonly used\u2014life satisfaction, happiness, ladder\u2014and new SWB questions. We find that respondents\u2019 self-reports differ from researchers\u2019 assumptions, and differ across SWB questions and sociodemographic groups. At the same time, simple SWB-question wording tweaks are effective in moving self-reports towards desired interpretations. We outline actionable suggestions for SWB researchers.\n\n",
