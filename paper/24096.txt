Behavioral Inattention

JEL No. D03,D11,D51,E03,G02,H2
ABSTRACT
Inattention is a central, unifying theme for much of behavioral economics. It permeates such
disparate fields as microeconomics, macroeconomics, finance, public economics, and industrial
organization. It enables us to think in a rather consistent way about behavioral biases, speculate
about their origins, and trace out their implications for market outcomes.
This survey first discusses the most basic models of attention, using a fairly unified framework.
Then, it discusses the methods used to measure attention, which present a number of challenges
on which a great deal of progress has been achieved, although much more work needs to be done.
It then examines the various theories of attention, both behavioral and more Bayesian. It finally
discusses some applications. For instance, inattention offers a way to write a behavioral version
of basic microeconomics, as in consumer theory and Arrow-Debreu. A last section is devoted to
open questions in the attention literature.
This chapter is a pedagogical guide to the literature on attention. Derivations are self-contained.

Introduction

It is clear that our attention is limited. When choosing, say, a bottle of wine for dinner,
we think about just a few consideration (the price and the quality of the wine), but not
about the myriad of components (for example, future income, the interest rate, the potential
learning value from drinking this wine) that are too minor. Traditional rational economics
assumes that we process all the information that is freely available to us.
Modifying this classical assumption is empirically desirable and theoretically doable.
Moreover, it is necessary in order to attain greater psychological realism in economic modeling, and ultimately to improve our understanding of markets and to design better policies.
This chapter is a user-friendly introduction to this research. The style of this chapter is
that of a graduate course, with pedagogical, self-contained derivations.1 We will proceed as
follows.
Section 2 is a high-level overview. I use a simple framework to model the behavior
of an inattentive consumer. Attention is parameterized by a value m, such that m = 0
corresponds to zero attention (hence, to a very behavioral model in which the agent relies
on a very crude “default” perception of the world) and m = 1 to full attention (hence, to the
traditional rational model). At a formal level, this simple framework captures a large number
of behavioral phenomena: inattention to prices and to taxes; base rate neglect; inattention
to sample size; over- and underreaction to news (which both stem from inattention to the
true autocorrelation of a stochastic time series); local inattention to details of the future
(also known as “projection bias”); global inattention to the future (also known as hyperbolic
discounting). At the same time, the framework is quite tractable. I also use this framework
to discuss the psychology of attention.
Once this framework is in place, Section 3 discusses methods used to measure inattention
empirically: from observational ones like eye-tracking to some that more closely approach a
theoretical ideal.2 I then survey concrete findings in the empirics of attention. Measuring
attention is still a hard task – we still have only a limited number of papers that measure
attention in field settings — but it is often rewarded with very good publications.
Figure 1 synthesizes this literature measuring attention. On average, the attention parameter estimated in the literature is 0.44, roughly halfway between no attention and full
attention. Sensibly, attention is higher when the incentives to pay attention are stronger.
The survey then takes a more theoretical turn, and explores in greater depth the determinants of attention. In Section 4, I start with the most tractable models, those that
yield deterministic predictions (that is, for a given situation, there is a deterministic action).
1

Other surveys exist. DellaVigna (2009) offers a broad and readable introduction to measurement, in
particular of inattention, and Caplin (2016) offers a review, from a more information-theoretic point of view.
2
I positioned this section early in the survey because many readers are interested in the measurement of
attention. While a small fraction of the empirical discussion uses some notions from the later theoretical
analysis, I wished to emphasize that most of it simply relies on the basic framework of Section 2.

Figure 1: Attention point estimates (m) vs. relative value of opaque attribute
(τ /p), with overlaid calibrated attention function. Underlying those studies is the
following common setup: the full price q = p + τ of a good is the sum of a based good price
p and an opaque price τ . However, an inattentive consumer will perceive q s = p + mτ , where
m captures attention to the opaque attribute. A value m = 1 corresponds to full attention,
while m = 0 implies complete inattention. This figure shows (circles) point estimates of
the attention parameter m in a cross-section of recent studies (shown in Table 1), against
the estimated relative value of the opaque τ add-on attribute relative to the base good or
quantity (τ /p). The overlaid curve shows the corresponding calibration of the quadratic-cost
attention function in (26), where we impose α = 1 and obtain calibrated cost parameters
κ̄ = 3.0%, q = 22.4 via nonlinear least squares. Additionally, for comparison, we plot
analogous data points (triangles) for subsamples from the study of Busse, Lacetera, Pope,
Silva-Risso, and Sydnor (2013b), who document inattention to left-digit remainders in the
mileage of cars sold at auction, broken down along covariate dimensions. Each data point in
the latter series corresponds to a subsample including all cars with mileages within a 10,000
mile-wide bin (e.g., between 15,000 and 25,000 miles, between 25,000 miles and 35,000 miles,
and so forth). For each mileage bin, we include data points from both retail and wholesale
auctions.

Some models rely on the plain notion that more important dimensions should be given more
attention – this is plain, but not actually trivial to capture in a tractable model. Some other
models put the accent on proportional thinking rather than absolute thinking: in this view,
people pay more attention to relatively more important dimensions.
Section 6 then covers models with stochastic decisions – given an objective situation, the
prediction is a probability distribution over the agents’ actions. These are more complex
models. We will cover random choice models, as well as the strand of the literature in which
agents pay to acquire more precise signals. We will then move on to the entropy-based
penalty that has found particular favor among macroeconomists.
What are the consequences of introducing behavioral inattention into economic models?
This chapter reviews many such implications, in industrial organization, taxation, macroeconomics, and other areas. Section 5 presents something elementary that helps unify all of
these strands: a behavioral version of the most basic chapter of the microeconomics textbook à la Varian (1992), including consumer theory, and Arrow-Debreu. As most of rational
economics builds on these pillars, it is useful to have a behavioral alternative.
Section 7 moves on to dynamic models. The key pattern there is that of delayed reaction:
people react to novel events, but with some variable lag. Sometimes, they do not attend to
a decision altogether – we have then a form of “radical inattention”. Useful approaches in
this domain include models that introduce costs from changing one’s action, or costs from
changing one’s thinking (these are called “sticky action” and “sticky information” models,
respectively). We will also discuss models of “habit formation”, and models in which agents
optimally choose how to acquire information over time. We will understand the benefits and
drawbacks of each of these various models.
Finally, Section 8 proposes a list of open questions. The appendices give mathematical
complements and additional proofs.

A Simple Framework for Modeling Attention

In this section I discuss a simple framework for thinking about behavioral inattention in
economic modeling, and I argue that this simple structure is useful in unifying several themes
of behavioral economics, at least in a formal sense. I start from a basic example of prioranchoring and adjustment toward perceived signals in a model with Gaussian noise, and

7

then move to a more general model structure that captures behavioral inattention in a
deterministic fashion.

2.1

An introduction: Anchoring and adjustment via Gaussian signal extraction


Suppose there is a true value x, drawn from a Gaussian distribution N xd , σx2 , where xd is
the default value (here, the prior mean) and variance σx2 . However, the agent does not know
this true value, and instead she receives the signal
s=x+ε

(1)

where ε is drawn from an independent distribution N (0, σε2 ). The agent takes the action a.
The agent’s objective function is u (a, x) = − 21 (a − x)2 , so that if she’s rational, the agent


wants to take the action that solves: maxa E − 21 (a − x)2 |s . That is, the agent wants to
guess the value of x given the noisy signal s. The first-order condition is
0 = E [− (a − x) |s] = E [x | s] − a
so that the rational thing to do is to take the action a (s) = x̂ (s), where x̂ (s) is the expected
value of x given s,
x̂ (s) = E [x | s] = λs + (1 − λ) xd
(2)
with the dampening factor3
σx2
λ= 2
∈ [0, 1] .
σx + σε2

(3)

Equation (2) says that the agent should anchor at the prior mean xd , and partially adjust
(with a shrinkage factor m) toward the signal s. The average action ā (x) := E [a (s) |x] is
then:
ā (x) = mx + (1 − m) xd
(4)
with λ = m. In the rest of this paper, I will analogously use the common notation m to
index the limited reaction to a stimulus. In this Bayesian subsection, m is microfounded as
a Bayesian ratio of variances λ, but in more general contexts (that we shall see shortly) that
need not be the case. In the limit case of an agent who is perfectly well-informed, σε = 0,
and m = 1. In the opposite limit of a very confused agent with infinite noise (σε → ∞),
m = 0 and the agent relies entirely on her default value.
This is akin to the psychology of “anchoring and adjustment”. As Tversky and Kahneman
(1974, p. 1129) put it: “People make estimates by starting from an initial value that is
3

The math used here should be familiar, but a refresher is given in Appendix A.

8

adjusted to yield the final answer [...]. Adjustments are typically insufficient”. Here, agents
start from the default value xd and on expectation adjusts it toward the truth x. Adjustments
are insufficient, as m ∈ [0, 1], because signals are generally imprecise.
Most models are variants or generalizations of the model in equation (4), with different
weights m (endogenous or not) on the true value. In this review, I discuss a first class of
models that eliminates the noise, as not central, at least for the prediction of the average
behavior (see Section 4). I then discuss a second class of frameworks in which noise is central
– which often leads to more complicated models (see Section 6).
Before discussing these variants and generalizations, I will present a simple formal framework for modeling inattention.

2.2

Models with deterministic attention and action

Most models of inattention have the following common structure. The agent should maximize
max u (a, x)
a

(5)

where, as before, a is an action (possibly multidimensional), and x is a vector of “attributes”,
e.g. price innovations, characteristics of goods, additional taxes, deviations from the steady
state and so on. So a rational agent will choose ar (x) = argmaxa u (a, x).
The behavioral agent replaces this by an “attention-augmented decision utility”,
max u (a, x, m)
a

(6)

where m is a vector that will characterize the degree of attention – i.e. the agent’s subjective
model of the world. She takes the action
a (x, m) = argmax u (a, x, m) .
a

In inattention models, we will very often take (as in Gabaix and Laibson 2006; Chetty,

9

Looney, and Kroft 2009; DellaVigna 2009; Gabaix 2014)4

u (a, x, m) = u a, m1 x1 + (1 − m1 ) xd1 , . . . , mn xn + (1 − mn ) xdn .

(9)

where mi ∈ [0, 1] is the attention to variable xi , and where xdi is the “default value” for
variable i — it is the value that spontaneously comes to mind with no thinking. This is as
if xi is replaced by the subjectively perceived xsi :
xsi := mi xi + (1 − mi ) xdi ,

(10)

When mi = 0, the agent “does not think about xi ”, i.e. replaces xi by xsi = xdi .5 When
mi = 1, she perceives the true value (xsi = xi ). When 0 < mi < 1, she perceives partially
the true value, though not fully; one microfoundation for that may be the model of Section
(2.1), where the agent reacts partially to a noisy signal.6
The default xdi is typically the prior mean of xi . However, it can be psychologically richer.
For instance, if the mean price of good i is E [xi ] = $10.85, then the normatively simplest
default is xdi = E [xi ] = $10.85. But the default might be a truncated price, e.g. xdi = $10
(see Lacetera, Pope, and Sydnor, 2012).
To fix ideas, take the following quadratic example:
1
u (a, x) = −
2

a−

(11)

with 0 for the default values (xdi = 0). Then, the traditional optimal action is
r

a (x) =

n

b i xi ,

(12)

i=1

where the r superscript is as in the traditional r ational actor model. For instance, to choose
4

Some other models (e.g. Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer 2013, reviewed below in section 4.2), take the
form
u (a, x, m) = u (a, ma1 x1 , . . . , man xn )
(7)
where the attention parameters depend on the goods and the action, so that m has dimensions A × n,
where A is the number of goods. We keep a simpler form now, as it allows us to use continuous actions (so
A = ∞) and take derivatives with respect to action a. Also, the attention parameter m is often deployed
multiplicatively “outside the utility”, as in

u (a, x, m) = mu (a, x) + (1 − m) u a, xd
(8)
Still, in most cases with continuous actions placing m inside the utility function makes the model more
tractable and more expressive.
5
Responding to the “default” xdi (corresponding to mi = 0) is referred to in the psychology literature
alternatively as an automatic, habitual or prepotent response.
6
The linear form is largely for analytical convenience, and is not essential.

10

a, the decision maker should consider not only innovations x1 in her wealth, and the deviation
of GDP from its trend, x2 , but also the impact of interest rate, x10 , demographic trends in
China, x100 , recent discoveries in the supply of copper, x200 , etc. There are an innumerable
number of factors that should in principle be taken into account. A sensible agent will “not
think” about most of these factors, especially the less important ones. We will formalize this
notion.
After attention m is chosen, the behavioral agent optimizes under her simpler representation of the world, i.e. chooses
s

a (x, m) =

n
X

bi mi xi ,

i=1

so that if mi = 0, she doesn’t pay attention to dimension i.

2.3

Unifying behavioral biases: Much of behavioral economics
may reflect a form of inattention

Let us see some examples that will show how this form captures – at a formal level at
least – many themes of behavioral economics. We shall see that many behavioral biases
share a common structure: people anchor on a simple perception of the world, and partially
adjusts toward it. Conceptually, there is a “default, simple model” that spontaneously
comes to mind,7 and there is a “true model” that’s only imperfectly perceived. Attention
m parameterizes the particular convex combination of the default and true models that
corresponds to the agent’s perception.8
This feeling of unity of behavioral economics is tentative — and in part my own speculation, rather than an agreed-upon truth. Still, I find it useful to make a case for it in this
chapter. One could imagine doing “attentional interventions” (changing m) to investigate
this type of hypothesis experimentally (see e.g. Lombardi and Fehr (2018) for a step in that
direction).
Different cognitive functions underlying limited attention Attention involves the
allocation of scarce cognitive resources. In the examples below, I will not go much into the
detailed exploration of what those scarce resources are. They include limited working memory, limited ability to carry out complex algorithms, or lack of readily-accessible knowledge.9
7

Kahneman and Frederick (2002) call something very close to this idea “attribute substitution” – the use
of a simplified model, or question, that is cognitively easier than the original problem.
8
Gabaix (2014, Online Appendix, Section 9.A) contains an early version of this list, with a fuller treatment
some of the biases below, including the endogenization of attention m.
9
For instance, in the contexts of the examples discussed in this subsection, limited working memory presumably drives the inattention to taxes and the left-digit bias; limited ability to carry out complex algorithms
is relevant for the exponential growth bias; and the lack of readily-accessible knowledge is important for the

11

What drives attention are components of information processing, which are subsumed by
the common abstraction m that I use in all these examples.
2.3.1

Inattention to true prices and shrouding of add-on costs

Let us illustrate the misperception of numbers in the context of prices. We start from a
default price pd . The new price is p, while the subjectively price ps perceived by the agent is
ps = mp + (1 − m) pd .

(13)

The perceived price ps responds only partially (with a strength m) to the true price p,
perhaps as in the noisy-signal microfoundation of Section 2.1.
Take the case without income effects, where the rational demand is cr (p) . Then, the
demand of a behavioral agent is cs (p) = cr (ps (p, m)) . So, the sensitivity of demand to price
is cs (p)0 = mcr (ps )0 . The demand sensitivity is muted by a factor m.
We can also reason in logarithmic space, so that the perceived price is:
ps = (p)m pd

1−m

.

(14)

In general, the psychology of numbers (Dehaene 2011) shows that the latter formulation
(in log space) is psychologically more accurate. This Cobb-Douglas formulation is sometimes
used in Gabaix (2014) and Khaw, Li, and Woodford (2017) – the latter framework is a
stochastic one, and explores how the model’s stochasticity is useful to match the empirical
evidence.
Similar reasoning applies to the case of goods sold with separate add-ons. Suppose that
the price of a base good is p, and the price of an add-on is p̂. The consumer might only
partially see the add-on, such that she perceives the add-on cost to be p̂s = mp̂. As a result,
the myopic consumer perceives total price to be only p + mp̂, while the full price is p + p̂.
Such myopic behavior allows firms to shroud information on add-on costs from consumers
in equilibrium (Gabaix and Laibson 2006).
2.3.2

Inattention to taxes

Suppose that the price of a good is p, and the tax on that good is τ . Then, the full price
is q = p + τ . But a consumer may pay only partial attention to the tax, so the perceived
tax is τ s = mτ , and the perceived price is q s = p + mτ . Chetty, Looney, and Kroft (2009)
develop this model, develop the theory of tax incidence, and measure attention to sales
taxes in routine consumer purchases. Farhi and Gabaix (2017) provide a systematic theory
inattention to the future, in that costly simulations may need to be performed.

12

of optimal taxation (encompassing the Ramsey, Pigou and Mirrlees problems) with this type
of misperceptions and other biases.
2.3.3

Nominal illusion

The notion of nominal illusion is very related. Suppose that the real price change is q,
inflation is π, and the nominal price change is p, so that the real price change is:
q = p − π.
People will often anchor to the nominal price, without removing enough inflation. The real
price that they will perceive is:
q s = p − mπ,
(15)
where m = 0 signifies full nominal illusion. Recent research has shown that nominal anchoring has a surprising impact on stock market analysts (Roger et al. (2018)), and may be even
important for concrete outcomes (Shue and Townsend (2018)).
2.3.4

Hyperbolic discounting: Inattention to the future

In an intertemporal choice setting, suppose that true utility is U0 =
P
t−1

U1 = ∞
t=1 δ
U0 = u0 + δU1 .

(16)

A present-biased agent (Laibson 1997; O’Donoghue and Rabin 1999) will instead see a
perceived utility
U0s = u0 + mδU1 .
(17)
The parameter m is equivalent here to the parameter β in the hyperbolic discounting
literature.10
Still, the normative interpretation is different. If the m = β is about misperception,
then the favored normative criterion is to maximize over the preferences of the rational
agents, i.e maximize u0 + δU1 (Farhi and Gabaix 2017). In contrast, with the multiple selves
interpretations usually associated with hyperbolic discounting (Thaler and Shefrin 1981;
Fudenberg and Levine 2012) the welfare criterion is not so clear as one needs to trade off the
utility of several “selves”. Bernheim and Rangel (2009) similarly advocate for an agnostic
10

Gabaix and Laibson (2017) develop an interpretation of discounting via cognitive myopia much along
these lines. Abela et al. (2012) present laboratory evidence that damage to the hippocampus (an area of the
brain associated with both working memory and long-term memory) increases impulsive decision-making.
This may be because, say, the memory of eating peaches in the past is necessary to simulate the future utility
from eating a peach.

13

welfare criterion for behavioral models that does not privilege the preferences of the rational
agent.
2.3.5

When will we see overreaction vs. underreaction?

Suppose that a variable yit follows a process yi,t+1 = ρi yit + εit , and εit is an i.i.d. innovation
with mean zero. The decision-maker however has to deal with many such processes, with
various autocorrelations, that are ρd on average. Hence, for a given process, she may not
fully perceive the autocorrelation, and instead use the subjectively perceived autocorrelation
ρsi , as in
ρsi = mρi + (1 − m) ρd .
(18)
That is, instead of seeing precisely the fine nuances of each AR(1) process, the agent
anchors on a common autocorrelation ρd , and then adjusts partially toward the true autocorrelation of variable yit , which is ρi . The agent’s prediction is Est [yi,t+k ] = (ρsi )k yi,t , so
that
 s k
ρi
s
Et [yi,t+k ]
Et [yi,t+k ] =
ρi
where Est is the subjective expectation, and Et is the rational expectation. Hence, the agent
ρs
exhibits overreaction for processes that are less autocorrelated than ρd , as ρii > 1, and
ρs

underreaction for processes that are more autocorrelated than ρd , as ρii < 1.11
For instance, if the growth rate of a stock price is almost not autocorrelated, and the
growth rate of earnings has a very small positive autocorrelation, people will overreact to
past returns by extrapolating too much (Greenwood and Shleifer 2014). On the other hand,
processes that are quite persistent (say, inflation) will be perceived as less autocorrelated
than they truly are, and agents will underreact by extrapolating too little (as found by
Mankiw, Reis, and Wolfers 2003).12
2.3.6

Prospect theory: Inattention to the true probability

There is a literature in psychology (but not widely known by behavioral economists) that
finds that probabilities are mentally represented in “log odds space”. Indeed, in their survey
Zhang and Maloney (2012) assert that this perceptual bias is “ubiquitous” and give a unified
account of many phenomena. If p ∈ (0, 1) is the probability of an event, the log odds are
p
q := ln 1−p
∈ (−∞, ∞). Then, people may misperceive numbers as in (2) and (4), i.e. their
11

This sort of model is used in Gabaix (2016, 2018).
As of now, this hypothesis for the origin of under/overreaction has not been tested, but it seems plausible
and has some indirect support (e.g. from Bouchaud, Krueger, Landier, and Thesmar 2016). A meta-analysis
of papers on under/overreaction, perhaps guided by the simple analytics here, would be useful. There are
other ways to generate over / underreaction, e.g. Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998), which
relies on investor overconfidence about the accuracy of their beliefs, and biased self-attribution (see also
Hirshleifer et al. (2011)).

which is the median perception of a behavioral agent: we have derived a probability weighting function π (p). This yields overweighting of small probabilities (and symmetrically underweighting of probabilities close to 1).14 Psychologically, the intuition is as follows: a
probability of 10−6 is just too strange and unusual, so the brain “rectifies it” by dilating it
toward a more standard probability such as pd ' 0.36, and hence overweighting it.15 This is
exactly as in the simple Gaussian updating model of Section 2.1, done in the log odds space,
and gives a probability weighing function much like the one in prospect theory (Kahneman
and Tversky 1979). This theme is pursued (with a different functional form, not based on
the psychology of the log odds space surveyed in Zhang and Maloney 2012) by Steiner and
Stewart (2016).16
Likewise, for the “diminishing sensitivity” part of prospect theory, one can appeal to the
1−m0
0
distortions of payoffs as in (14): a payoff is X is perceived as X s = X m X d
(this
is done, with experimental evidence, by Khaw et al. 2017). Putting the two themes above
(distortions of payoff and distortions of probability) together, we get something much like
prospect theory: the perceived value of a gamble offering X with probability p and Y with
probability 1 − p is:
h
i
1−m0
0
0
V = π (p) X m − π (1 − p) Y m X d
(21)
In the rational model we have m0 = m = 1, so that π (p) = p.
How to obtain loss aversion? To get it, we’d need to assume a “pessimistic prior”,
saying that the typical gamble in life has negative expected value.17 For instance the default
probability for loss events is higher than the default probability in gains events. This might
create loss aversion. A complete treatment of this issue is left to future research.
13

I use the median, because perception contains noise around the mean, and the median is more tractable
when doing monotonous non-linear transformations.
14
This behavioral bias is well-documented empirically: DellaVigna and Pope 2018 conduct a meta-analysis
of the relevant experimental (and quasi-experimental) literature – averaging across studies, they estimate a
mean probability weight of 6% for a true probability of 1%.
15
Here I take pd ' 0.36 as this is the crossover value where p = ps in Prelec’s (1998) survey.
16
See also Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2012).
17
In that hypothesis, people would have “pessimistic prior” about general exchanges in life, and be “overconfident” about their own abilities.

15

2.3.7

Projection bias: Inattention to future circumstances by anchoring on
present circumstances

Suppose that I need to forecast xt , a variable at time t. I might use its time-zero value as
an anchor, i.e. xdt = x0 . Then, my perception at time zero of the future variable is
xst = mxt + (1 − m) x0 ,

(22)

hence the agent exhibits projection bias. See also Loewenstein, O’Donoghue, and Rabin
(2003) for the basic analysis, and Chang, Huang, and Wang (2018) as well as Busse, Knittel,
and Zettelmeyer (2013a) for empirical evidence in support of this.
2.3.8

Coarse probabilities and partition dependence

Suppose that there are K disjoint potential outcomes E1 , ..., EK (which form a partition of
the event space). It is hard to know their probability, so a sensible default probability for
events E1 , ..., EK is a uniform prior, P d (E) = K1 for all E = E1 , . . . ,EK . Then, people may
partially adjust towards the truth, and perceive the probability of event E as
P s (E) = mP (E) + (1 − m)P d (E) .

(23)

A correlated notion is that of “partition dependence”. When people are asked “what’s
the probability of dying of cancer” vs “what’s the probability of dying of lung cancer, or brain
cancer, or breast cancer” etc., their assessed probabilities change, in a way that’s partitiondependent (Sonnemann et al. 2013). So, as “cancer” is divided into more categories, people
perceive that the likelihood of cancer is higher.
2.3.9

Base-rate neglect: Inattention to the base rate

In base-rate neglect (Tversky and Kahneman 1974) people seem to react a little bit to the
base rate, but not enough. A simple way to capture that is is posit that they anchor their
perceived based rate on the “uninformative” base rate P d (E), which is a uniform distribution
on the values of E, as in (23). Then, they use Bayes rule with this. This generates base rate
neglect.18
2.3.10

Correlation neglect

Another way to simplify a situation is to imagine that random variables are uncorrelated,
as shown by Enke and Zimmermann (forthcoming). To formalize this, let us say that the
true probability of variables y = (y1 , . . . , yn ) is a joint probability P (y1 , ..., yn ), and the
18

Grether (1980) uses a logarithmic variant of this equation. One could imagine a deeper model where
people do not used Bayes’ rule altogether, but that would take use too far afield.

16

(marginal) distribution of yi is Pi (yi ). Then the “simpler” default probability is the joint
density assuming no correlation P d (y) = P1 (y1 ) . . . Pn (yn ). Correlation neglect is captured
by a subjective probability P s (y) = mP (y) + (1 − m) P d (y).
2.3.11

Insensitivity to sample size

Tversky and Kahneman (1974) show the phenomenon of “insensitivity to sample size”. One
way to model this is as follows: the true sample size N is replaced by a perceived sample
1−m m
N , and agents update based on that perceived sample size.
size N s = N d
2.3.12

Insensitivity to predictability / Misconceptions of regression to the mean
/ Illusion of validity: Inattention to randomness and noise

Tversky and Kahneman (1974) report that, when people see a fighter pilot’s performance,
they fail to appreciate the role of mean reversion. Hence, if the pilot does less well the next
time, they attribute this to lack of motivation, for instance, rather than reversion to the
mean.
Call x the pilot’s core ability, and st = x+εt the performance on day t, where εt is an i.i.d.
Gaussian noise term and x is drawn from a N (0, σx2 ) distribution. Given the performance st
of, say, an airline pilot, an agent predicts next period’s performance (Tversky and Kahneman
1974). Rationally, she predicts s̄t+1 := E [st+1 | st ] = λst with λ = 1+σ12 /σ2 .
ε
x
However, a behavioral agent may “forget about the noise”, i.e. in her perceived model,
Vars (ε) = mσε2 . If m = 0, they don’t think about the existence of the noise, and answer
y st+1 = yt . Such agent will predict:
s̄st+1 =

1
1+

mσε2
σa2

st .

Hence, behavioral agents with m = 0, who fully ignore randomness and noise, will just
expect the pilot to do next time as he did last time.
2.3.13

Overconfidence: Inattention to my true ability

If x is my true driving ability, with overoptimism my prior xd may be a high ability value;
perhaps the ability of the top 10% of drivers. There are explanations for this kind of overconfidence: people often have to advocate for themselves (on the job, in the dating scene
etc.), and one is a better advocate of one’s superiority if one actually believes in it (Mercier
and Sperber 2011, see also Bénabou and Tirole 2002). Rosy perceptions come from this
high default ability (for myself), coupled with behavioral neglect to make the adjustment.
A related bias is that of “overprecision”, in which I think that my beliefs are more accurate
than they are: then x is the true precision of my signals, and xd is a high precision.
17

2.3.14

Cursedness: Inattention to the conditional probability

In a game theoretic setting, Eyster and Rabin (2005) derive the equilibrium implications of
cursedness, a behavioral bias whereby players underestimate the correlation between their
strategies and those of their opponents. The structure is formally similar, with cursedness χ
being 1 − m: the agent forms a belief that is an average of m times to the true probability,
and 1 − m times a simplified, naı̈ve probability distribution.19
2.3.15

Left-digit bias: Inattention to non-leading digits

with a ≥ 1 and b ∈ [0, 1).

where a low value of m ∈ [0, 1] indicates left-digit bias. Lacetera, Pope, and Sydnor (2012)
find compelling evidence of left-digit bias in the perception of the mileage of used cars sold
at auction.20
2.3.16

Exponential growth bias

Many people appear to have a hard time compounding interest rates, something that Stango
and Zinman (2009) call the exponential growth bias. Here, if x = (1 + r)t is the future value
of an asset, then the simpler perceived value is xd = 1 + rt, and the perceived growth is just
xs = mx + (1 − m) xd . 21
2.3.17

Taking stock of these examples

These examples, I submit, illustrate that the simple framework above allows one to think
in a unified way about a wide range of behavioral biases, at least in their formal structure.
There are four directions in which such baseline examples can be extended. Here I give a
brief outline of these four directions, along with a number of examples that are discussed at
greater length in later sections of this survey:
1. In the “theoretical economic consequences” direction, economists work out the consequences of partial inattention, e.g. in market equilibrium, or in the indirect effects of
19

For empirical evidence linking cursedness to limitations in cognitive skill, see also Carroll, Bazerman,
and Maury (1988), who show that players in two-person negotiation games generally lack knowledge of how
to compute conditional expectations from their opponent’s point of view.

approximations in the context of subjective time-series forecasting.

18

all this.
2. In the “empirical economic measurement” direction, researchers estimate attention m.
3. In the “basic psychology” direction, researchers think more deeply about the “default
perception of the world”, i.e. what an agent perceives spontaneously. Psychology helps
determine this default.22
4. In the “endogenization of the psychology” part, attention m is endogenized. This can
be helpful, or not, in thinking about the two points above. Typically, endogenous
attention is useful to make more refined predictions, though most of those remain to
be tested. In the meantime, a simple quasi-fixed parameter like m is useful to have,
and allows for parsimonious models – a view forcefully argued by Rabin (2013).

2.4

Psychological underpinnings

Here is a digest of some features of attention from the psychology literature. Pashler (1998)
and Nobre and Kastner (2014) handbook offer book-length surveys on the psychology of
attention, with primary emphasis on perception. Knudsen (2007) offers a neuroscienceoriented perspective.
2.4.1

Conscious versus unconscious attention

Systems 1 and 2. Recall the terminology for mental operations of Stanovich (1999) and
Kahneman (2003), where “system 1” is an intuitive, fast, largely unconscious and parallel
system, while “system 2” is a deliberative, slow, relatively conscious and serial system.
System 2, working memory, and conscious attention. It is likely that we do not consciously contemplate thousands of variables when dealing with a specific problem. For instance, research on working memory documents that people handle roughly “seven plus or
minus two” items (Miller 1956). At the same time, we do know – in our long term memory
– about many variables, x. Hence, we can handle consciously relatively few mi that are
different from 0.23
System 1 / Unconscious attention monitoring. At the same time, the mind contemplates
unconsciously thousands of variables xi , and decides which handful it will bring up for
conscious examination (that is, whether they should satisfy mi > 0). For instance, my
system 1 is currently monitoring if I’m too hot, thirsty, low in blood sugar, but also in the
presence of a venomous snake, and so forth. This is not done consciously. But if a variable
22

It would be nice to have a “meta-model” for defaults, unifying the superficial diversity of default models.
In attentional theories, System 1 chooses the attention (e.g. as in Step 1 in Proposition 4.1), while the
decision is done by System 2 (as in Step 2 in the same Proposition).
23

19

becomes very alarming (e.g. a snake just appeared), it will be “brought to consciousness” –
that is, to the attention of system 2. Those are the variables with an mi > 0.
To summarize, System 1 chooses the mi ’s in an unconscious, parallel fashion, while
System 2 takes a decision based on the few elements that have been brought to consciousness
(i.e. with mi > 0).
This view has a good degree of support in psychology. In a review paper, Dehaene et al.
(2017) say:
William James described attention as “the taking possession by the mind, in clear
and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects
or trains of thought”. This definition is close to what we mean by [...] the selection of a single piece of information for entry into the global workspace. There
is, however, a clear-cut distinction between this final step, which corresponds to
conscious access, and the previous stages of attentional selection, which can operate unconsciously. Many experiments have established the existence of dedicated
mechanisms of attention orienting and shown that, like any other processors, they
can operate nonconsciously.
2.4.2

Reliance on defaults

What guess does one make when there is no time to think? This is represented by the case
m = 0: then, variables x are are replaced by their default value, which could be some
plain average value, or a crude heuristics. This default model (m = 0), and the default
action ad (which is the optimal action under the default model) corresponds to “system
1 under extreme time pressure”. The importance of default actions has been shown in
a growing literature (e.g. Madrian and Shea 2001; Carroll, Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and
Metrick 2009).24 Here, the default model is very simple (basically, it is “do not think about
anything”), but it could be enriched, following other models (e.g. Gennaioli and Shleifer
2010).25
2.4.3

Neuroscience: The neural correlates of “mental cost” and “limited attention”

It would be great to know the neural correlates of “limited attention” and things like “mental
costs” and “mental fatigue” – what exactly is this scarce resource in the brain? Sadly
24

This literature shows that default actions matter, not literally that default variables matters. One
interpretation is that the action was (quasi-)optimal under some typical circumstances (corresponding to
x = 0). An agent might not wish to think about extra information (i.e., deviate from x = 0), and hence
deviate from the default action.
25
There is no systematic theory of the default yet. This default is a close cousin of what Bayesians call
the prior (in fact we might imagine that subjective priors would be very crude, for instance a uniform prior).
There is no systematic theory of where the prior comes from either.

20

neuroscience research has not found it (Section 4 of Kurzban et al. (2013) is a clear discussion
of this). A early proposal was glucose in the brain, but it has been discredited. Hence, the
attention literature needs to theorize it without clear guidance from the neuro literature.
2.4.4

Other themes

If the choice of attention is largely unconscious, this leads to the curious choice of “attentional
blindness”. Mack and Rock (1998) studied attentional blindness extensively, and the now
canonical experiment for this is the “gorilla” experiment of Simons and Chabris (1999).
When asked to perform a task that requires full attentional resources, subjects often didn’t
see a gorilla in the midst of the experiment.
Another rich field is that of visual attention. Treisman and Gelade (1980) is classic paper
in the field, and Carrasco (2011) surveys the literature. One theme – not well integrated by
the economics literature, is the “extreme seriality of thought” (see Huang and Pashler 2007):
in the context of visual attention, it means that people can process things only one color at
a time. In other contexts, like the textbook rabbit / duck visual experiment, it means that
one can see a rabbit or a duck in a figure, but not both at the same time.
From an economic point of view, serial models that represent the agent’s action step
by step tend to be complicated though instructive (see Rubinstein 1998; Gabaix, Laibson, Moloche, and Weinberg 2006; Caplin, Dean, and Martin 2011; Fudenberg, Strack, and
Strzalecki 2017, which feature various forms of information search). Because of the limited applicability of process-based models, more “outcome-based models”, which directly
give the action rather than the intermediary steps, are typically easier to use in economic
applications.

Measuring Attention: Methods and Findings

I now turn to the literature on the empirical measurement of attention. I first provide a
broad taxonomy of the approaches taken in the literature, and then discuss specific empirical
findings. The recent empirical literature on inattention has greatly advanced our ability to
understand behavioral biases quantitatively, such that we can now begin to form a synthesis
of these results. I present such a synthesis at the end of this section.

3.1

Measuring attention: Methods

There are essentially five ways to measure attention:26
1. Deviations from an optimal action (this requires to know the optimal action)
26

This classification builds on DellaVigna’s (2009).

21

2. Deviations from normative cross-partials, e.g. from Slutsky symmetry (this does not
require to know the optimal action)
3. Physical measurement, e.g. time on task and eye-tracking.
4. Surveys: eliciting people’s beliefs.
5. Imputations from the impact of attentional interventions: impact of reminders, of
advice.
As we will see, methods 3-5 can show that attention is not full (hence, help reject the naı̈ve
rational and costless-cognition model) and measure correlates of attention (e.g. time spent),
and 1 and 2 measure attention as defined in this survey (e.g., measure the parameter m).27
3.1.1

Measuring inattention via deviation from an optimal action

Suppose the optimal action function is ar (x) := argmaxa u (a, x), and the behavioral action is
as (x) = ar (mx). Then, the derivative of the action with respect to x is: asx (x) = marx (mx).
Therefore attention can be measured as28
asx
m= r.
ax
Hence, the attention parameter m is identified by the ratio of the sensitivities to the
signal x of the boundedly-rational action function aBR and of the rational action function
ar . This requires knowing the normatively correct slope, arx . How does one do that?
1. This could be done in a “clear and understood” context, e.g. where all prices are very
clear, perhaps with just a simple task (so that in this environment, m = 1), which
allows us to measure arx . This is the methodology used by Chetty, Looney, and Kroft
(2009), Taubinsky and Rees-Jones (2017), and Allcott and Taubinsky (2015).
2. Sometimes, the “normatively correct answer” is the attention of experts. Should one
buy generic drugs (e.g. aspirins) or more expensive “branded drugs” – with the same
basic molecule? For instance, to find out the normatively correct behavior, Bronnenberg, Dubé, Gentzkow, and Shapiro (2015) look at the behavior of experts – health
care professionals – and find that they are less likely to pay extra for premium brands.
27

Here, I define measuring attention as measuring a parameter m like in the simple model of this chapter,
or its multidimensional generalization m1 , ..., mn . However, one could wish to estimate a whole distribution
of actions (i.e., a (x) being a random variable, perhaps parametrized by some m). This is the research
program in Caplin and Dean (2015); Caplin, Dean, and Leahy (2016). This literature is more conceptual
and qualitative at this stage, but hopefully one day it will merge with the more behavioral literature.

To be very precise, m (x) = arx(mx) . So, one can get m assuming small deviations x (so that we measure
x
the limit m (0)), or the limit of a linearized rational demand ar (x) .

We shall review the practical methods later.29
3.1.2

Deviations from Slutsky symmetry

We will see below (Section 5.1.2) that deviations from Slutsky symmetry allow one in principle to measure inattention. Aguiar and Riabov (2016) and Abaluck and Adams (2017)
use this idea to measure attention. In particular, Abaluck and Adams (2017) show that
Slutsky symmetry should also hold in random demand models. Suppose the utility for good
i is vi = ui − βpi , and the consumer chooses a = argmaxi (ui − βpi + εi ), where the εi are
arbitrary noise terms (still, with a non-atomic distribution), which could even be correlated.
The probability of choosing i is ci (p) = P (ui − βpi + εi = maxj uj − βpj + εj ). Define the
∂ci
. Then, it turns out that we have Sij = Sji again, under the raSlutsky term Sij = ∂p

tional model. So, with inattention to prices, and cs (p) = cr M p + (1 − M ) pd , where
M = diag (m1 , . . . , mn ) is the diagonal matrix of attention, we have
Sijs = Sijr mj
exactly as in (57). Abaluck and Adams (2017) explore this and similar relations to study the
inattention to complex health care plans. They structurally estimate the model described in
this section, including in the random choice specification most of the variables that would
be available to individuals making Medicare Part D elections, such as premia, deductibles,
and so forth. It is nice to see how an a priori abstruse idea (the deviation from Slutsky
symmetry in models of limited attention, as in Gabaix 2014) can lead to concrete real-world
measurement of the inattention to health-care plan characteristics.
3.1.3

Process tracking: time on task, Mouselab, eye tracking, pupil dilatation,
etc.

A popular way to measure activity is with a process-tracing experiment commonly known
as Mouselab (Camerer et al. 1993; Payne, Bettman, and Johnson 1993; Johnson et al.
2002; Gabaix, Laibson, Moloche, and Weinberg 2006), or with eye tracking methods. In
Mouselab, subjects need to click on boxes to see which information they contain. In eye
tracking (Reutskaja, Nagel, Camerer, and Rangel 2011), researchers can follow which part of
the screen subjects look at, i.e. track information gathering. There are other physiological
methods of measurement as well, such as measuring pupil dilation (which measures effort,
Kahneman 1973). See Schulte-Mecklenbeck et al. (2017) for a recent review.
Krajbich, Armel, and Rangel (2010) and Krajbich and Rangel (2011) introduce an class
of algorithmic models that link visual perception and simple choices. These attentional drift29

In some cases, the context-appropriate attention parameter m is quite hard to measure. So, people use
a “portable already-estimated parameter”, e.g. m = β = 0.7 for hyperbolic discounting.

23

diffusion models (aDDM) posit that — when choosing among multiple responses — the brain
accumulates the evidence in favor of one response relative to others until a decision threshold
is reached. These relative choice values evolve according to an exogenous visual attention
process. The authors find that aDDM models do very well at explaining empirically observed
patterns of eye movement and choice in the lab. Arieli, Ben-Ami, and Rubinstein (2011) use
an eye-tracking experiment to trace the decision process of experiment participants in the
context of choice over lotteries, and find that that individuals rely on separate evaluations
of prizes and probabilities in making their decisions.
Lahey and Oxley (2016), using eye tracking techniques, examine recruiters, and see what
information they look at in resumes, in particular from white vs African-American applicants.
Bartoš, Bauer, Chytilová, and Matějka (2016) and Ambuehl (2017) study how information
acquisition is influenced by incentives.
3.1.4

Surveys

One can also elicit a measurement of attention via surveys. Of course, there is a difficulty.
Take an economist. When surveyed, she knows the value of interest rates. But that doesn’t
mean that she actually takes the interest rate into account when buying a sweater – so as
to satisfy her rational Euler equation for consumption. Hence, if people show ignorance
in a survey, it is good evidence that they are inattentive. However, when they exhibit
knowledge, it does not mean that they actually take into account the variable in their
decision. Information, as measured in surveys, is an input of attention, but not the actual
attention metric.30
For instance, a number of researchers have found that, while people know their average
tax rate, they often don’t know their marginal one, and often use the average tax rate
as a default proxy for the marginal tax rate (De Bartolomé 1995; Liebman and Zeckhauser
2004).31 Relatedly, Handel and Kolstad (2015) survey the employees of a large firm regarding
regarding the health insurance plans available to them and find substantial information
frictions.
3.1.5

Impact of reminders, advice

If people don’t pay attention, perhaps a reminder will help. In terms of modeling, such a
reminder could be a “free signal”, or an increase in the default attention mdi to a dimension.
A reminder could come, for instance, from the newspaper. Huberman and Regev (2001)
show how a New York Times article that re-reports stale news creates a big impact for
30
In terms of theory, when asked about the “what is the interest rate”, I know the interest rate matters a
great deal. When asked “what’s the best sweater to buy”, the interest rate does not matter much (Gabaix
2016).
31
This is, people perceive the marginal tax rate to me mxd + (1 − m) x with xd the average tax rate and
x the marginal tax rate.

24

one company’s stock price. It is not completely clear how that generalizes. There is also
evidence that reminders have an impact on savings (Karlan, McConnell, Mullainathan, and
Zinman 2016) and medical adherence (Pop-Eleches et al. 2011). The impact of this type
of reminders is typically small, possibly because the reminder (which may be for instance a
text message) does not shift attention very much, rather than because attention was almost
perfect initially.
In a laboratory context, Johnson, Häubl, and Keinan (2007) show that the typical endowment effect (Kahneman et al. 1991) can be reversed by simply asking people to first
think about what they could do with the proceeds from selling an object (for example, a
coffee mug), and only then listing the reasons for which they want to keep that object. This
demonstrates that merely altering the order in which people think about the various aspects
of a problem has an impact on their eventual decision (presumably via changing their attention to those various aspects): this is an idea that Johnson, Häubl, and Keinan (2007) call
“query theory”.
Hanna, Mullainathan, and Schwartzstein (2014) provide summary information to seaweed
farmers. This allows the farmers to improve their practice, and achieve higher productivity.
This is consistent with a model in which farmers were not optimally using all the information
available to them. For instance, this could be described by a model such as Schwartzstein’s
(2014). In this model, if an agent is pessimistic about the fact that some piece of information is useful, she won’t pay attention to it, so that she won’t be able to realize that it
is useful. Knowledge about the informativeness of the piece of information leads to paying
more attention, and better learning.
Again, this type of evidence shows that attention is not full, although it doesn’t measure
it.

3.2

Measuring attention: Findings

Now that we have reviewed the methods, let us move to specific findings on attention.
3.2.1

Inattention to taxes

People don’t fully pay attention to taxes, as the literature has established, using the methodology of Section 3.1.1, and this is important for normative taxation (Mullainathan, Schwartzstein,
and Congdon (2012); Farhi and Gabaix (2017)). Chetty, Looney, and Kroft (2009) find a
mean attention of between 0.06 (by computing the ratio of the semi-elasticities for sales
taxes, which are not included in the sticker price, vs. excise taxes, which are included in the
sticker price) and 0.35 (computing the ratio of the semi-elasticities for sales taxes vs. more

25

salient sticker prices).3233
Taubinsky and Rees-Jones (2017) design an online experiment and elicit the maximum tag
price that agents would be willing to pay when there are no taxes or when there are standard
taxes corresponding to their city of residence. The ratio of these two prices is 1 + mτ , where
τ is the tax. This allows the estimation of tax salience m. Taubinsky and Rees-Jones (2017)
find (in their standard tax treatment)34 that E [m] = 0.25 and Var (m) = 0.13. So, mean
attention is quite small, but the variance is high. The variance of attention is important,
because when attention variance is high, optimal taxes are generally lower (Farhi and Gabaix
2017) – roughly, because heterogeneity in attention creates heterogeneity in response, and
additional misallocations, which increase the dead-weight cost of the tax. Taubinsky and
Rees-Jones (2017) reaffirm this conclusion, and find that accounting for heterogeneity in
consumer attention would increase the estimated efficiency losses from realistically-calibrated
sales taxes by more than 200%.
3.2.2

Shrouded attributes

It is intuitively clear that many people won’t pay attention to “shrouded attributes”, such as
“surprise” bank fees, minibar fees, shipping charges, and the like (Ellison 2005; Gabaix and
Laibson 2006; Ellison and Ellison 2009). Gabaix and Laibson (2006) work out the market
equilibrium implication of such attributes with naı̈ve consumers – e.g. consumers who are
not paying attention to the existence of shrouded attributes when buying the “base good”.
In particular, if there are enough naı̈ves there is an inefficient equilibrium where shrouded
attributes are priced far above marginal costs. In this equilibrium, naı̈ve consumers are
“exploited”, to put it crudely: they pay higher prices and subsidize the non-naı̈ves.
There is a growing field literature measuring the effects of such fees and consumers’ inattention to them. Using both a field experiment and a natural experiment, Brown, Hossain,
and Morgan (2010) find that consumers are inattentive to shrouded shipping costs in eBay
online auctions. Grubb (2009) and Grubb and Osborne (2015) show that consumers don’t
pay attention to sharp marginal charges in three-part tariff pricing schemes,35 and predict
32

In an online auction experiment. Greenwood and Hanson (2014) estimate an attention m = 0.5 to
competitors’ reactions and general equilibrium effects.
33
See also Russo (1977) for earlier field-experimental evidence on the impact of tax salience on consumer
purchasing decisions. Relatedly, Finkelstein (2009) studies drivers who pay tolls in cash vs via electronic toll
collection (a more automatic and invisible form of payment). The latter were substantially more likely to
respond “I don’t know” when asked about how much the toll was, and were also more likely to be incorrect
if they offered a guess. Abeler and Jäger 2015 also show that attention to tax incentives is lower when they
are more complex.
34
They actually provide a lower bound on variance, and for simplicity we take it here to be a point estimate.
35
Three-part tariffs are pricing schemes in which a seller offers a good or a service for a fixed fee that comes
with a certain usage allowance, as well as a per-unit price that applies to all extra usage in excess of that
allowance. One common example is cellphone plans: cellphone carriers commonly offer a certain amount of
call minutes and data usage for a fixed price, but charge an extra marginal fee once consumers exceed the
allotted quota.

26

their future demand with excessive ex-ante precision – for example, individuals frequently
exhaust their cellular plans’ usage allowance, and incur high overage costs. Brown, Camerer,
and Lovallo (2012, 2013) show that when film studios withhold movies from critics before
their release, moviegoers fail to infer that this may indicate low movie quality – showing that
people are indeed behavioral rather than Bayesian (a Bayesian agent should be suspicious
of any non-disclosed item, rather than just ignore it like a behavioral agent). Similarly,
Jin, Luca, and Martin (2017) use a series of laboratory experiments to show that in general
consumers form overly optimistic expectations of product quality when sellers choose not to
disclose this information. This literature overlaps with a theoretical literature probing more
deeply into firms’ incentives to hide these attributes (Heidhues and Kőszegi 2010, 2017), and
a related literature modeling competition with boundedly rational agents (Spiegler 2011; Tirole 2009; Piccione and Spiegler 2012; De Clippel, Eliaz, and Rozen 2014). The companion
survey on Behavioral Industrial Organization, by Paul Heidhues and Botond Kőszegi, in this
volume, details this.
3.2.3

Inattention in health plan choices

There is mounting evidence for the role of confusion and inattention in the choice of health
care plans. McFadden (2006) provides an early discussion of consumers’ misinformation in
health plan choices, particularly in the context of Medicare Part D elections. Abaluck and
Gruber (2011) find that people choose Medicare plans less often if premiums are increased
by $100 than if expected out of pocket cost is increased by $100. Handel and Kolstad (2015)
study the choice of health care plans at a large firm. They find that poor information about
plan characteristics has a large impact on employees’ willingness to pay for the different
plans available to them, on average leading them to overvalue plans with more generous
coverage and lower deductibles (see also Handel (2013)). This study documents a mistake
in an important economic context. Ericson (2014) documents consumer inertia in health
plan choices, and Abaluck and Adams (2017) show this inertia is largely attributable to
inattention.
3.2.4

Inattention to health consequences

It is intuitively clear that we do not always attend to the health consequences of our choices,
e.g. when drinking a sugary soda or smoking a cigarette, we underperceive the future health
costs (e.g. cancer) from those enjoyments. Several studies have quantified the magnitude
of these underperceived costs, and applied them to the normative study of optimal “sin
taxation”. Allcott, Lockwood, and Taubinsky (2017) use survey data to measure the price
elasticity of demand for sugary beverages, and deliver optimal sin tax formulas in terms of
these sufficient statistics. Gruber and Kőszegi (2001) conduct a similar study by postulating
hyperbolic discounting, and importing the parameter m = β ' 0.7 into the model.
27

3.2.5

People use rounded numbers

Lacetera, Pope, and Sydnor (2012) estimate inattention via buyers’ “left-digit bias” in evaluating the mileage of used cars sold at auction. Call x the true mileage of a car (i.e., how
many miles it has been driven), and xd the mileage rounded to the leading digit, and let
r = x − xd be the “mileage remainder.” For instance, if x = 12, 345 miles, then xd = 10, 000

miles and r = 2, 345 miles, and the perceived mileage is xs = xd + m x − xd . Lacetera,
Pope, and Sydnor (2012) estimate a structural model for the perceived value of cars of the
form V = −f (xs (x, m)). They find a mean attention parameter of m = 0.69 (see also
Englmaier et al. (2017)). Busse, Lacetera, Pope, Silva-Risso, and Sydnor (2013b) break
down this estimate along covariate dimensions, and find that attention is lower for older and
cheaper cars, and lower for lower-income retail buyers.36
This is a very nice study, as it offers clean identification and high quality data – hence
a more precise estimate of attention than most other papers. It would be nice to see if it
matches the quantitative predictions of models discussed in this survey (for example, that
in equation (35)).
3.2.6

Do people account for the net present value of future costs and benefits?

When you buy a car, you should pay attention to both the sticker price of the car, and
the present value of future gasoline payments. But it is very conceivable that some people
will pay less than full attention to the future value of gas payments: the full price of the
car pcar +pgas will be perceived as mcar pcar +mgas pgas . Two papers explore this, and have
somewhat inconsistent findings. Allcott and Wozny (2014) find partial inattention to gas
gas
= 0.76. However, Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2013a)
prices: their estimate is mmprice
gas
find that they cannot reject the null hypothesis of equal attention, mmprice
= 1. One hopes
that similar studies, perhaps with data from other countries, will help settle the issue. One
can conjecture that people likewise do not fully pay attention to the cost of car parts –
this remains to be seen. A related literature, starting with Hausman (1979), has found
that people apply high discount rates to future energy costs when purchasing electricityconsuming durables such as refrigerators or air conditioners (see Frederick, Loewenstein,
and O’Donoghue (2002) for a more recent survey of this literature).
3.2.7

Inattention in finance

There is now a large amount of evidence of partial inattention in finance. This is covered in
greater depth in the companion chapter on Behavioral Finance, by Nick Barberis. Here are
36

In addition to the studies already mentioned, Shlain (2018) estimates a structural model of left-digit
bias using retail scanner data; mean estimated attention to the left-digit remainder of prices is m = 0.74 in
the study’s main specification. This work was circulated after the final draft of this survey was completed,
so that it could not be integrated in the final tables and figures.

28

some samples from this literature.
When investors have limited attention, the specific format in which accounting statements
are presented matters. Hirshleifer and Teoh (2003) is an influential model of that, which
relates accounting statements to misvaluations. Relatedly, Hirshleifer, Lim, and Teoh (2009)
find that when investors are more distracted (as there are more events that day), inefficiencies
are stronger: for instance, the post-earnings announcement drift is stronger. Peng and Xiong
(2006) study the endogenous attention to aggregate vs idiosyncratic risk.
DellaVigna and Pollet (2007) find that investors have a limited ability to incorporate
some subtle forces (predictable changes in demand because of demographic forces) into their
forecasts, especially at long horizons. DellaVigna and Pollet (2009) show that investors are
less attentive on Fridays: when companies report their earnings on Fridays, the immediate
impact on the price (as a fraction of the total medium run impact) is lower. Hirshleifer, Lim,
and Teoh (2009) show how investors are less attentive to a given stock when there are lots
of other news in the market. In a similar vein, Barber and Odean (2007) show that retail
investors overweight attention-grabbing stocks in their portfolios: for example, the stocks
of companies that have recently received high media coverage. In a controlled laboratory
context, Frydman and Rangel (2014) find that decreasing attention to a stock’s purchase
price reduces the extent to which people display a disposition effect (i.e., an abnormally high
propensity to sell stocks that have realized capital gains).
Cohen and Frazzini (2008) document that investors are quick at pricing the “direct”
impacts of an announcement, but slower at pricing the “indirect” impact (e.g. a new plane
by Boeing gets reflected in Boeing’s stock price, but less quickly in that of Boeing’s supplier
network). Giglio and Shue (2014) find that investors underreact to the passage of time after
merger announcements, even though lack of news is in fact informative of a higher probability
that the deal will be successfully completed: in effect, investors pay limited attention to “no
news”.
Malmendier and Nagel (2011) find that generations who experienced low stock market
returns invest less in the stock market. People seem to put too much weight on their own
experience when forming their beliefs about the stock market.
Fedyk (2018) shows that positioning of news on the front page of the Bloomberg terminal
platform induces abnormally high trading volumes for the affected companies in the first few
minutes after new publication: investors appear to pay a disproportionately low amount of
attention to news that is not on the front page.
This literature is growing quickly.37 It would be nice to have more structural models,
37

A related study – which may also be linked to models of reference dependence — is that of Baker, Pan,
and Wurgler (2012), who find that when thinking about a merger or acquisition price, investors put a lot of
weight on recent (trailing 52 weeks) prices. This has real effects: merger waves occur when high returns on
the market and likely targets make it easier for bidders to offer a peak price. This shows an intriguing mix
of attention to a partially arbitrary price, and its use as an anchor in negotiations and perhaps valuations.

predicting in a quantitative way the speed of diffusion of information.
3.2.8

Evidence of reaction to macro news with a lag

There is much evidence for delayed reaction in macro data. Friedman (1961) talks about
“long and variable lags” in the impacts of monetary stimulus. This is also what motivated
models of delayed adjustment, e.g. Taylor (1980). Empirical macro research in the past
decades has frequently found that a variable (e.g. price) reacts to shocks in other variables
(e.g. nominal interest rate) only after a significant delay (e.g., quarters or years).
Delayed reaction is confirmed by the more modern approaches of Romer and Romer
(1989) and Romer and Romer (2004), who identify monetary policy shocks using the narrative account of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Meetings38 and find that the
price level would only start falling 25 months after a contractionary monetary policy shock.
This is confirmed also by more formal econometric evidence with identified VARs. Sims
(2003) notes that in nearly all Vector Autoregression (VAR) studies, a variable reacts with
delay when responding to shocks in other variables, even though a rational theory would
predict that it should instantaneously jump. Such finding is robust in VAR specifications
of various sizes, variable sets, and identification methods (Leeper, Sims, and Zha 1996;
Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans 2005). While it is feasible to generate delayed response
using adjustment costs, large adjustment costs would imply that a variable’s reactions to all
shocks are smooth, contradicting the VAR evidence that responses to own shocks tend to be
large. A model of inattention, however, can account for both phenomena simultaneously.
Finally, micro survey data suggest that macro sluggishness is not just the result of delayed
action, but rather the result of infrequent observation as well. Alvarez, Guiso, and Lippi
(2012) and Alvarez, Lippi, and Paciello (2017) provide evidence of infrequent reviewing of
portfolio choice and price setting, respectively, with clean analytics (see also Abel, Eberly,
and Panageas 2013 for a sophisticated model along those lines). A median investor reviews
her portfolio 12 times and makes changes only twice annually, while a median firm in many
countries reviews price only 2-4 times a year.
3.2.9

Evidence on level-k thinking in games

An impactful literature on level-k thinking in games has generated a large amount of empirical evidence for the lack of strategic sophistication in games (Nagel 1995; Ho et al. 1998).
Level-k models (Stahl and Wilson 1995; Camerer et al. 2004) allow players to vary in their
levels of strategic sophistication: level-0 players randomize their strategies; level-1 players
best-respond under the assumption that all other players are level-0; level-2 players bestrespond under the assumption that everyone else is a level-1 thinker, and so forth. Within
38

The intended interest rate changes identified in accounts of FOMC Meetings are further orthogonalized
by relevant variables in Fed’s information set (Greenbook Forecasts), making it plausibly exogenous.

30

the framework laid out in this survey, level-k thinking can be understood as lack of attention
to higher-order strategical issues, perhaps because of cognitive limitations. Level-0 players
corresponds to fully inattentive agents (m = 0), while level-∞ players are the traditional
rational agents who make full use of all available information (m = 1).
Camerer, Ho, and Chong (2004) estimate that an average parameter value k = 1.5
fits well empirical data from a wide variety of games, which implies a rather low value of
m. A related empirical literature corroborates this finding and contributed to many of the
advances in experimental process-tracking methods discussed in subsection 3.1.3: see for
example Costa-Gomes et al. (2001), Wang, Spezio, and Camerer (2010), and Brocas et al.
(2014).39

3.3

Attention across stakes and studies

Attention over many studies Figure 1 (in the introduction) and Table 1 and contain a
synthesis of eleven measurements of attention – I selected all the studies I could find that
measured attention (i.e., gave an estimate of the parameter m). They are a tribute to the
hard work of many behavioral economists. I am sure that this table will be enriched over
time.
Table 1 shows point estimates of the attention parameter m in the literature discussed
in this survey. For each distinct study or experimental setting, I report the most aggregated
available estimates. In each of these studies, m is measured as the degree to which individuals
underperceive the value of an opaque add-on attribute τ to a quantity or price p, such that
the subjectively perceived total value of the quantity is q s (m) = p + mτ .
Correspondingly, for each economic setting I show the estimated ratio of the values p
and τ , which is a measure of the relative significance of the add-on attribute τ . Appendix B
outlines the details of the methodology used to compile this data. Figure 1 plots the point
estimates of m against the estimated value of τ /p.40 In addition to this cross-study data,
Figure 1 plots a second set of intra-study data points from Busse, Lacetera, Pope, SilvaRisso, and Sydnor (2013b), who offer very precise estimates of attention broken down along
covariate dimensions. By looking at subsamples of Busse, Lacetera, Pope, Silva-Risso, and
Sydnor’s (2013b) dataset of more than 22 million of used car transactions, we are able to
effectively highlight the co-movement between m and the relative importance of the add-on
attribute. Attention is high for car mileage presumably because the absolute dollar stakes
(rather than just the relative stakes τp ) are particularly high.
39

See Avoyan and Schotter (2018) for a related exploration of limited attention in games.
I use the relative value as a determinant of attention. This arises if, for a given decision, there is a
fixed attention budget between different attributes of the problem, and their relative importance determine
attention. In the model of Section 4.1.1, this is microfounded by endogenizing the κ and using the “scale-free”
κ, as in Gabaix (2014), section V.C.
40

Table 1: Attention estimates in a cross-section of studies. This table shows point
estimates of the attention parameter m in a cross-section of recent studies, alongside the
estimated relative value of the opaque add-on attribute with respect to the relevant good
or quantity (τ /p). I report the most aggregated available estimates for each distinct study
or experimental setting. The quantity τ is the estimated mean value of the opaque good or
quantity against which m is measured; the quantity p is the estimated mean value of the good
or quantity itself, exclusive of the opaque attribute. Appendix B describes the construction
methodology and details. Studies are arranged by their τ /p value, in descending order.

As noted above, mean attention is 0.44 – roughly in the middle of the two poles of full
rationality and complete inattention. We see that, sensibly, attention does increase with
incentives. 41 We can actually propose a model-based calibration of this attention.

where Aα is an attention function, which will be derived in Section 4.1.1. For now, the reader
can think of the attention function Aα as the solution to a problem in which an agent chooses
optimal attention m subject to the tradeoff between the penalty resulting from inattention
and the cost of paying attention. For this calibration, I allow the attention cost function to
depend quadratically on m, to a degree parameterized by the scalar parameter q ≥ 0, such
that the attention function is given by the following variant of (34),
α

m∈[0,1] 2

Aα (σ 2 ) := arg min

(26)

where the parameter q captures the curvature of the attention function. In order to retain
both continuity and sparsity of the attention function (26), I impose the sparsity-inducing
restriction α = 1, which results in

I estimate the cost parameters κ̄ and q on the cross-study data via nonlinear least squares,
according to the model in (25). This yields calibrated parameters κ̄ = 3.0% and q = 22.4.

Different meanings of “attention”

The concept of “attention” has several meanings. The primary meaning in this survey is
that of “the extent to which an agent’s cognitive process is able to make use of all available
41

It is reassuring to see the attention covarying positively with incentives in Figure 1. In part, this is
because the problems collected in the figure happen to have arguably roughly similar levels of complexity.
If problem complexity (“κ” in later notations) varied a lot across studies, a future update of Figure 1 could
potentially show a less clean positive relation between stakes and attention. Likewise, in situations where
stakes are very important in dollar terms (e.g. for car purchases), attention is likely to be higher.
42
Things are expressed in terms of the “scale free cost” κ̄ (see Gabaix 2016, Sections 4.2 and 10.2, which
conjectures that “a reasonable parameter might be κ̄ =5%”), which is unitless, so potentially portable across
contexts. It means that agents don’t consider attributes τ whose relative importance τp is less than κ̄. It
also justifies the scaling τp , where the “natural scale” of the decision is p. This assumes that the attention
budget has a fixed amount for the task at hand. Understanding the degree of fungibility of attention across
tasks is an interesting research frontier.

33

data” (relative to a normative, rational benchmark, so that m = 1 means full attention), and
is captured by this summary measure m — something we might call “effective attention”.
Measuring it requires some normative model. In much of psychology, however, attention
means “observable sensory inputs devoted to the task” – let us denote this by T , as in
time spent on the information, and call T the “observable attention”. For instance, a bored
student may look at a whole lecture (which lasts for T = 80 minutes), but still not really
exert effort (let us call M that mental effort) so that the total amount learned (indexed by
m) is very low. We have a relation of the type:
m = f (T, M ) ,
e.g. m = 1 − e−αM T . I note that T is directly measurable, m can also be measured, though
more indirectly, and M is quite nebulous at this stage. More generally, we can think of attentional inputs as “information gathering” (T in our example) and “information processing”
(M ).
In this survey I have emphasized m because it’s the summary quantity we need to predict
behavior, and because in many studies (e.g. on the attention to the tax) we don’t have access
to the time spent T . Also, even the whole time spent T is not a sufficient statistics for the
effective attention m – as active mental effort is hard to measure.
Still, the “observable attention” T is very precious – as it can be directly measured, and
much progress of science comes from focusing on directly measurable quantities. Hence,
the process tracking studies reviewed in Section 3.1.3 represent great advances. Sometimes,
observable attention T yields an excellent prediction of choice (for example, in context of
simple choices among two or three alternatives, as in Krajbich and Rangel (2011)).
One can hope that the understanding of observable attention T, and effective attention
m will continue to increase, with a healthy interplay between the two.

Models of Endogenous Attention: Deterministic Action

We have seen that attention can be modeled in a simple way and that it can be measured.
In this section, we will study some deterministic models that endogenize attention.

4.1

Paying more attention to more important variables: The sparsity model

The model in Gabaix (2014) aims at a high degree of applicability – to do so, it generalizes
the max operator in economics, by assuming that agents can be less than fully attentive. This

34

provides a foundation for a behavioral version of basic textbook microeconomics (Section 5),
of the basic theory of taxation (Farhi and Gabaix (2017)), of basic dynamic macroeconomics
(Gabaix (2016)), and macroeconomic fiscal and monetary policy (Gabaix (2018)).43
The agent faces a maximization problem which is, in its traditional version, maxa u (a, x)
subject to b (a, x) ≥ 0, where u is a utility function, and b is a constraint. In this section I
present a way to define the “sparse max” operator defined and analyzed in Gabaix (2014):44
smax u (a, x) subject to b (a, x) ≥ 0,
a

(28)

which is a less than fully attentive version of the “max” operator. Variables a, x and function
b have arbitrary dimensions.45
The case x = 0, will sometimes be called the “default parameter.” We define the default
action as the optimal action under the default parameter: ad := arg maxa u (a, 0) subject to
b (a, 0) ≥ 0. We assume that u and b are concave in a (and at least one of them is strictly

concave) and twice continuously differentiable around ad , 0 . We will typically evaluate the

derivatives at the default action and parameter, (a, x) = ad , 0 .
4.1.1

The sparse max without constraints

For clarity, we shall first define the sparse max without constraints, i.e. study smaxa u (a, x).
Motivation for optimization problem The agent maximizing (6) will take the action
a (x, m) := arg max u (a, x, m)
a

(29)

and she will experience utility v (x, m) = u (a (x, m) , x). Let us posit that attention creates
a psychic cost, parametrized by
X
C (m) = κ
mαi
i

with α ≥ 0. The case α = 0 corresponds to a fixed cost κ paid each time mi is non-zero.
The parameter κ ≥ 0 is a penalty for lack of sparsity. If κ = 0, the agent is the traditional,
rational agent model with costless cognition.
It follows that agent would allocate attention m as:
max E [u (a (x, m) , x)] − C (m) .
m

(30)

However, ever since Simon (1955), many researchers have seen that problem (30) is very com43

This subsection and Section 5 draw extensively from Gabaix (2014).
I draw on fairly recent literature on statistics and image processing to use a notion of “sparsity” that
still entails well-behaved, convex maximization problems (Tibshirani 1996, Candes and Tao 2006).
45
We shall see that parameters will be added in the definition of sparse max.
44

35

plicated – more complex than the original problem (we are threatened by “infinite regress”
problem). The key step of the sparse max is that the agent will solve a version of this
problem.
Definition 4.1 (Sparse max – abstract definition). In the sparse max, the agent optimizes
in two steps. In Step 1, she selects the optimal attention m∗ under a simplified version of the
optimal problem (30): (i) she replaces her utility by a linear-quadratic approximation, and
(ii) imagines that the vector x is drawn from a mean 0 distribution, with no correlations,
but the accurate variances. In Step 2, she picks the best action (29) under the exact utility
function, modulated by the attention vector m∗ selected in Step 1.
To to see this analytically, we introduce some notation. The expected size of xi is
1/2
σi = E [x2i ] , in the “ex ante” version of attention. In the “ex post allocation of attention”
∂a
, which indicates how much a change in xi
version, we set σi := |xi |. We define axi := ∂x
i
should change the action, for the traditional agent.46
The agent entertaining the simplified problem of Definition 4.1 will want to solve:47

where 12 Λii := − 12 E [x2i ] axi uaa axi is the gain that the consumer enjoys when he goes from zero
attention to full attention in dimension i (up to third order terms in the Taylor expansion).
Hence, (32) shows how the agent trades off the benefits of more attention (captured by
(1 − mi )2 Λii ) with the costs of attention (captured by κmαi ).
The attention function To build at least some intuition, let us start with the case with
just one variable, x1 = x and call σ 2 = Λ11 . Then, problem (32) becomes:

This implies
 axi = −uaa uaxi . Derivatives are evaluated at the default action and parameter, i.e. at
(a, x) = ad , 0 .
47
The justification is as follows. We call V (m) = E [u (a (x, m) , x)] the expected consumption utility.
Then, a Taylor expansion shows that we have, for small x (call ι = (1, . . . ,1) the vector corresponding to full
attention, like the traditional agent):

V (m) − V (ι) = −

defining Λij := −σij axi uaa axj , σij := E [xi xj ] and σ 2 = σi2 i=1...n . The Taylor expansions is for small
noises in x, rather than for m close to 1. The agent drops the non-diagonal terms (this is an optional, but
useful, assumption of sparse max).

examine A1 (σ ). When the stakes are small, attention is 0 (A1 (σ ) = 0 for σ 2 ≤ 1).
As stakes increase, attention becomes non-0, and as stakes becomes very large, attention
becomes full (limσ2 →∞ A1 (σ 2 ) = 1).
We now explore the case in which as indeed induces no attention to certain variables.49
Lemma 4.1 (Special status of linear costs). When α ≤ 1 (and only then) the attention
function Aα (σ 2 ) induces sparsity: when the variable is not very important, then the attention
weight is 0 (m = 0). When α ≥ 1 (and only then) the attention function is continuous.
Hence, only for α = 1 do we obtain both sparsity and continuity.
For this reason α = 1 is recommended for most applications. Below I state most results
in their general form, making clear when α = 1 is required.50
The sparse max: Values of attention The abstract definition of the sparse max, and
the functional form assumptions made above, lead to the following concrete procedure that
48

If there are multiple minimizers m, we take the the highest one.
P
α 1/α
Lemma 4.1 has direct antecedents in statistics: the pseudo norm kmkα = ( i |mi | )
is convex and
sparsity-inducing iff α = 1 (Tibshirani 1996).
50
The sparse max is, properly speaking, sparse (in the narrow sense of inducing zero attention) only when
α ≤ 1. When α > 1, the abuse of language seems minor, as the smax still offers a way to economize on
attention (as it generally shrinks attention towards 0). Perhaps smax should be called a “bmax” or behavioral
/ boundedly rational max.
49

37

describes that behavioral agent.
Proposition 4.1 The sparse max of Definition 4.1 is solved in two steps.
Step 1: Choose the attention vector m∗ , which is optimally equal to:

m∗i =Aα σi2 |axi uaa axi | /κ ,

(35)

where Aα : R → [0, 1] is the attention function expressed in (34), σi2 is the perceived variance
of x2i , axi = −u−1
aa uai is the traditional marginal impact of a small change in xi , evaluated at
x = 0, and κ is the cost of cognition.
Step 2: Choose the action
as = arg max u (a, x, m∗ ) .

(36)

a

Hence more attention is paid to variable xi if it is more variable (high σi2 ), if it should
matter more for the action (high |axi |), if an imperfect action leads to greater losses (high
|uaa |), and if the cost parameter κ is low.
The sparse max procedure in (35) entails (for α ≤ 1): “Eliminate each feature of the
world that would change the action by only a small amount”.51 This is how a sparse agent
sails through life: for a given problem, out of the thousands of variables that might be
relevant, he takes into account only a few that are important enough to significantly change
his decision.52 He also devotes “some” attention to those important variables, not necessarily
paying full attention to them.53
Let us revisit the initial example.54

Discrete goods All this can be extended to discrete actions. For instance, suppose that
the agent must choose one good among A goods. Good a ∈ {1...A} has value u (a, x) =

To see this formally (with α = 1), note that m has at most
components (because
mi 6= 0 implies b2i σi2 ≥ κ). Hence, when κ increases, the number of non-zero components becomes arbitrarily
small. Whenhx has iinfinite dimension, m has a finite number of non-zero components, and is therefore sparse
2
(assuming E (ar ) < ∞).
53
There is anchoring with partial adjustment, i.e. dampening. This dampening is pervasive, and indeed
optimal, in “signal plus noise” models (more on this later).

The proof is as follows. We have axi = bi , uaa = −1, so (35) gives mi = Aα b2i σi2 /κ .

m∗i = Aα b2i σi2 /κ

(38)

where σi2 is the variance of xia across goods. The behavioral action is then as = arg maxa u (a, x, m∗ ) .
4.1.2

Sparse max allowing for constraints

Let us now extend the sparse max so that it can handle maximization under K(= dim b)
constraints, which is problem (28). As a motivation, consider the canonical consumer problem:
max u (c1 , ..., cn ) subject to p1 c1 + ... + pn cn ≤ w.
(39)
c1 ,...,cn

We start from a default price pd . The new price is pi = pdi + xi , while the price perceived by
the agent is psi (m) = pdi + mi xi , i.e.55
psi (pi , m) = mi pi + (1 − mi ) pdi .
How to satisfy the budget constraint? An agent who underperceives prices will tend
to spend too much – but he’s not allowed to do so. Many solutions are possible, but the
following makes psychological sense and has good analytical properties. In the traditional
1
= pp12 . We
model, the ratio of marginal utilities optimally equals the ratio of prices: ∂u/∂c
∂u/∂c2
will preserve that idea, but in the space of perceived prices. Hence, the ratio of marginal
utilities equals the ratio of perceived prices:56
∂u/∂c1
ps
= 1s ,
∂u/∂c2
p2

(40)

i.e. u0 (c) = λps , for some scalar λ.57 The agent will tune λ so that the constraint binds, i.e.
the value of c (λ) = u0−1 (λps ) satisfies p · c (λ) = w.58 Hence, in step 2, the agent “hears
clearly” whether the budget constraint binds.59 This agent is behavioral, but smart enough
to exhaust his budget.
55


The constraint is 0 ≤ b (c, x) := w − pd + x · c.
ps
∂u/∂c1
56
Otherwise, as usual, if we had ∂u/∂c
> p1s , the consumer could consume a bit more of good 1 and less
2
2
of good 2, and project to be better off.
57
This model, with a general objective function and K constraints, delivers, as a special case, the third
adjustment rule discussed in Chetty, Looney, and Kroft (2007) in the context of consumption with two goods
and one tax.
58
If there are several λ, the agent takes the smallest value, which is the utility-maximizing one.
59
See footnote 69 for additional intuitive justification.

39

Consequences for consumption Section 5.1.1 develops consumer demand from the
above procedure, and contains many examples. For instance, Proposition 5.1 finds that
the Marshallian demand of a behavioral agent is
cs (p, w) = cr (ps , w0 ) ,

(41)

where the as-if budget w0 solves p · cr (ps , w0 ) = w, i.e. ensures that the budget constraint is
satisfied under the true price.
Determination of the attention to prices, m∗ . The exact value of attention, m, is not
essential for many issues, and this subsection might be skipped in a first reading. Call λd

Hence attention to prices is greater for goods (i) with more volatile prices ( ppdi ), (ii)
i
with higher price elasticity ψi (i.e. for goods whose price is more important in the purchase
decision), and (iii) with higher expenditure share (pdi cdi ). These predictions seem sensible,
though not extremely surprising. What is important is that we have some procedure to pick
the m, so that the model is closed. Still, it would be interesting to investigate empirically
the prediction of Proposition 4.2.
Generalization to arbitrary problems of maximization under constraints We next
generalize this approach to satisfying the budget constraint to arbitrary problems. The
reader may wish to skip to the next section, as this material is more notationally dense.
We define the Lagrangian L (a, x) := u (a, x) + λd · b (a, x), with λd ∈ RK
+ the Lagrange
multiplier associated with problem (28) when x = 0 (the optimal action in the default model
is ad = arg maxa L (a, 0)). The marginal action is: ax = −L−1
aa Lax . This is quite natural:
to turn a problem with constraints into an unconstrained problem, we add the “price” of
the constraints to the utility. Applying the Definition 4.1 to this case this the following
characterization.61
Proposition 4.3 (Sparse max operator with constraints). The sparse max, smaxa|κ,σ u (a, x)
subject to b (a, x) ≥ 0, is solved in two steps.
60


This is, u0 cd = λd pd , where pd is the exogenous default price, and cd is the (endogenous) optimal
consumption as the default.
61
For instance, in a consumption problem (39), λd is the “marginal utility of a dollar”, at the default
prices. This way we can use Lagrangian L to encode the importance of the constraints and maximize it
without constraints, so that the basic sparse max can be applied.

40

Step 1: Choose the attention m∗ as in (32), using Λij := −σij axi Laa axj , with axi =
s
∗
−L−1
aa Laxi . Define xi = mi xi the associated sparse representation of x.
Step 2: Choose the action. Form a function a (λ) := arg maxa u (a, xs ) + λb (a, xs ).
Then, maximize utility under the true constraint: λ∗ = arg maxλ∈RK
u (a (λ) , xs ) subject to
+
b (a (λ) , x) ≥ 0. (With just one binding constraint this is equivalent to choosing λ∗ such
that b (a (λ∗ ) , x) = 0; in case of ties, we take the lowest λ∗ .) The resulting sparse action is
as := a (λ∗ ). Utility is us := u (as , x).
Step 2 of Proposition 4.3 allows generally for the translation of a boundedly rational
maximum without constraints into a boundedly rational maximum with constraints. To
obtain further intuition on the constrained maximum, we turn to consumer theory.

4.2

Proportional thinking: The salience model of Bordalo, Gennaioli, Shleifer

In a series of papers, Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2012; 2013; 2016a) introduce a model
of context-dependent choice in which attention is drawn toward those attributes of a good
that are salient – that is, attributes that are particularly unusual with respect to a given
reference frame.
4.2.1

The salience framework in the absence of uncertainty

The theory of salience in the context of choice over goods is developed in Bordalo, Gennaioli,
and Shleifer (2013). In a general version of the model, the decision-maker chooses a good
from a set C = {xa } a=1,...,A of A > 1 goods. Each good in the choice set C is a vector xa =
(xa1 , . . . , xan ) of attributes xai which characterize the utility obtained by the agent along a
particular dimension of consumption. In the baseline case without behavioral distortions, the
utility of good a is separable across consumption dimensions, with relative weights (bi )i=1,...,n
Pn
attached to each dimension, such that u(a) =
i=1 bi xai . Each weight bi captures the
relative significance of a dimension of consumption, absent any salience distortions. In the
boundedly rational case, the agent’s valuation of good a instead gets the subjective (or
salience-weighted) utility:
n
X
us (a) =
bi mai xai
(42)
i=1

where mai is a weight capturing the extent of the behavioral distortion, which is determined
independently for each of the good’s attributes. The distortion mai of the decision weight bi
is taken to be an increasing function of the salience of attribute i for good a with respect
to a reference point x̄i . Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2013) propose using the average
value of the attribute among goods in the choice set as a natural reference point, that is

41

P
x̄i = A1 A
a=1 xai . Valuation is comparative in that what is salient about an option depends
on what you compare it to.
Formally, the salience of xai with respect to x̄i is given by σ(xai , x̄i ), where the salience
function σ satisfies the following conditions:
Definition 4.2 The salience function σ : R × R → R satisfies the following properties:62
1. Ordering. If [x, y] ⊂ [x0 , y 0 ] ∈ R, then σ(x, y) < σ(x0 , y 0 ).
2. Diminishing Sensitivity. If x, y ∈ R>0 , then for all  > 0, σ(x + , y + ) < σ(x, y).
3. Reflection.63 If x, y, x0 , y 0 ∈ R>0 , then σ(x, y) < σ(x0 , y 0 ) if and only if σ(−x, −y) <
σ(−x0 , −y 0 ).
According to these axioms, the salience of an attribute increases in its distance to that
attribute’s reference value, and decreases in the absolute magnitude of the reference point.
The agent focuses her attention on those attributes that depart from the usual, but any given
difference in an attribute’s value is perceived with less intensity when the magnitude of values
is uniformly higher. The reflection property guarantees a degree of symmetry between gains
and losses. A tractable functional form that satisfies the properties in Definition 4.2 is
σ(x, y) =

|x − y|
|x| + |y| + θ

(43)

with θ ≥ 0 is an application-dependent parameter. This functional form additionally is
symmetric in the two arguments x, y. The model is completed by specifying how the salience
values σ translate into the distortion weights mai . Letting (rai )i=1,...,n be the ranking of good
a’s attributes according to their salience (where rank 1 corresponds to the most salient
attribute), Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2013) propose the functional form
mai = Za δ rai

(44)

where the parameter δ ∈ (0, 1] measures the strength of the salience distortion, and Za is an
application-dependent normalization.64 In the case δ = 1 we recover the fully rational agent,
while in the limit case δ → 0 the agent only attends to the attribute that is most salient.65
62
In Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2013), the additional axiom that σ is symmetric is introduced. Since
the assumption of symmetry is relaxed in the case of choice among multiple goods, with multiple attributes,
for expository purposes I omit it in Definition 4.2.
63
This property is only relevant if σ admits both negative and positive arguments. This is discussed in
further depth in Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2012).
64
For the choice over goods, the authors propose Za = P nδrai . For probabilities, Za ensures that total
i
P
probability is 1, Za = 1/ ( i πi δ rai ).
65
The distortion function (44) can exhibit discontinuous jumps. An alternative specification introduced in Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2016a) that allows for continuous salience distortions is mai =
Za e(1−δ)σ(xai ,x̄i ) .

42

To see this model of salience in action, consider the case of a consumer choosing between
two bottles of wine, with high (H) and low (L) quality, in a store or at a restaurant. The two
relevant attributes for each good a ∈ {H, L} are quality qa and price pa . Suppose that utility
in the absence of salience distortions is Ua = qa − pa . The quality of bottle H, qH = 30, is 50
percent higher than the quality of bottle L, qL = 20. At the store, bottle H retails for $20,
while bottle L retails for $10. At the restaurant, each bottle is marked up and the prices are
$60 and $50, respectively. When is the consumer likely to choose the more expensive bottle?
While in the absence of salience distortions the agent is always indifferent between the
two bottles, salience will tilt the choice in one or the other direction depending on the choice
context. Taking the reference point for each attribute to be its average in the choice set, at
the store we have a “reference good” (q̄s, p̄s ) = (25, 15), while at the restaurant we have a
reference good (q̄r , p̄r ) = (25, 55). Under the functional form in (43), we can readily verify
that in the store price is the more salient attribute for each wine, while at the restaurant
quality is. Hence in the store the consumer focuses her attention on price and chooses the
cheaper wine, while at the restaurant the markup drives attention away from prices and
toward quality, leading her to choose the higher-end wine. Dertwinkel-Kalt et al. (2017)
provide evidence for this effect.
Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2016a) further embed the salience-distorted preference
structure over price and quality into a standard model of market competition. This yields a
set of predictions that depart from the rational benchmark, as firms strategically make price
and quality choices so as to tilt the salience of these attributes in their favor.

Salience and choice over lotteries

Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2012) develop the salience model in the context of choice
over lotteries. The framework is very similar to the one discussed for the case in which we
have no uncertainty. The decision-maker must choose among a set C of A > 1 lotteries.
We let S be the minimal state space associated with C, defined as the set of distinct payoff
combinations that occur with positive probability. The state space S is assumed to be
discrete, such that each state of the world i ∈ S occurs with known probability πi . The
payoff of lottery a in state of the world i is xai . Absent any salience distortions, the value of
P
lottery a is u(a) = i∈S πi v(xai ). Under salient thinking, the agent distorts the true state
probabilities and correspondingly assigns utility
us (a) =

X

πi mai v(xai )

(45)

i∈S

to lottery a, where the distortion weights mai are increasing in the salience of state i. Bordalo,
Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2012) propose evaluating the salience of state i in lottery a by
weighing its payoff against the average payoff yielded by the other lotteries in the same state

of the world, meaning that the salience is given by σ(xai , x̄i ), where x̄i = A−1
ã∈C: ã6=a xãi .
The salience model of choice under uncertainty presented in this section accounts for
several empirical puzzles, including the Allais paradoxes, yielding tight quantitative predictions for the circumstances under which such choice patterns are expected to occur. For a
concrete example, we consider the “common-consequence” Allais paradox as presented in
Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2012).66 In this version of the common-consequence Allais
paradox, originally due to Kahneman and Tversky (1979), experimental participants are
asked to choose between the two lotteries
L1 (z) = (2500, 0.33; 0, 0.01; z, 0.66)
L2 (z) = (2400, 0.34; z, 0.66)
for varying levels of the common consequence z. In a laboratory setting, when the common
consequence z is high (z = 2400), participants tend to exhibit risk-averse behavior, preferring
L2 (2400) to L1 (2400). However, when z = 0 most participants shift to risk-seeking behavior,
preferring L1 (0) to L2 (0). This empirical pattern is not readily accounted for by the standard
theory of choice under uncertainty, as it violates the axiom of independence.
In order to see how the salience model accounts for the Allais paradox, we need only
derive the conditions that determine the preference ranking over lotteries in the two cases
z = 2400 and z = 0. For this example, we assume the linear value function v(x) = x and we
take σ to be symmetric in its arguments, such that for all states i ∈ S we have homogeneous
salience rankings in the case of choice between two lotteries a, ã – that is, rai = rãi := ri .
We further assume the distortion function is defined analogously to (44). These conditions
yield the following necessary and sufficient criterion for lottery a to be preferred in a choice
between a and ã:
X
i∈S

δ ri πi [v(xai ) − v(xãi )] > 0.

(46)

When z = 2400, the minimum state space for the lotteries in the choice set is S =
{(2500, 2400), (0, 2400), (2400, 2400)} which from the ordering and diminishing sensitivity
properties of σ yields the salience rankings
σ(0, 2400) > σ(2500, 2400) > σ(2400, 2400).
By criterion (46), in order to account for the preference relation L2 (2400)  L1 (2400) it
must then hold be that
.01 (2400) − .33δ (100) > 0,
66

44

which is true whenever δ < .73. Intuitively, for low enough δ the agent focuses her attention
on the salient downside of 0 in L1 (0), which lowers her valuation of it. By an analogous
argument, when z = 0 a necessary and sufficient condition for L1 (0)  L2 (0) is that δ ≥ 0.
Hence the Allais paradox is resolved for δ ∈ [0, .73), when the decision-maker exhibits salience
bias of great enough significance.

Attention to various time dimensions: “Focusing”

The model of focusing of Kőszegi and Szeidl (2013) expresses a shrinkage assumption similar
to that of sparsity (Section 4.1), but with a different emphasis in applications, and an
assumption of additivity. The model assumes that the decision-maker gives higher attention
on those dimensions of the choice problem that are of primary order – which Kőszegi and
Szeidl (2013) take to be the attributes along which her options vary by the largest amount.
Given a choice set C = {xa }a=1...A of A > 1 actions that yield utilities (xai )i=1...n along n
P
dimensions, the decision-maker departs from the rational benchmark u(a) = ni=1 xai by
distorting the importance of each consumption dimension to a degree that is increasing in
the latitude of the options available to her in that dimension. Formally, we capture the range
σi of dimension i as the range (one could imagine another way, e.g. the standard deviation
of the xai across actions a)
σi = max xai − min xai .
(47)

Subjectively perceived utility is:

mi xai ,

(48)

i=1

where the attention weight is
mi = A(σi )

(49)

and the attention function A is increasing in the range of outcomes σi . Intuitively, the
decision-maker attends to those dimensions of the problem in which her choice is most
consequential. Hence, we obtain a formulation related to sparsity, though it does not use its
general apparatus, e.g. the nonlinear framework and microfoundation for attention.
In the context of consumer finance, the focusing model explains why consumers occasionally choose expensive financing options even in the absence of liquidity constraints. Suppose
an agent is buying a laptop, and has the option of either paying $1000 upfront, or enrolling
in the vendor’s financing plan, which requires 12 future monthly payments of $100. For
simplicity, we assume no time-discounting and linear consumption disutility from monetary
payments. We also take consumption in each period of life to be a separate dimension of
45

the choice problem. The agent therefore chooses between two actions a1 , a2 yielding payoff vectors x1 = (−1000, 0, . . . , 0) and x2 = (0, −100, . . . , −100) respectively. The vector
of utility ranges is therefore σ = (1000, 100, . . . , 100), such that the prospect of a large
upfront payment attracts the agent’s attention more than the repeated but small subsequent payments. The choice-relevant comparison is between us (a1 ) = −A(1000) · 1000 and
> 1.2, the agent will choose the more expenus (a2 ) = −A(100) · 1200. As long as A(1000)

sive monthly payment plan, even though she does not discount the future or face liquidity
constraints. Relatedly, Kőszegi and Szeidl (2013) also demonstrate how the model explains
present-bias and time-inconsistency in preferences in a generalized intertemporal choice context.
Bushong, Rabin, and Schwartzstein (2016) develop a related model, where however A(σ)
is decreasing in σ, though σA(σ) is increasing in σ. This tends to make the agent relatively
insensitive to the absolute importance of a dimension. Interestingly, it tends to make predictions opposite to those of Kőszegi and Szeidl (2013), Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2013)
and Gabaix (2014). The authors propose that this is useful to understand present bias, if
“the future” is lumped in one large dimension in the decision-making process.
4.3.2

Motivated attention

The models discussed in this section do not feature motivated attention (a close cousin of
motivated reasoning) – e.g. the fact that I might pay more attention to things that favor or
are pleasing to me (a self-serving bias), and avoid depressing thoughts. There is empirical
evidence for this; for instance Olafsson and Pagel (2017) find that people are more likely
to look at their banking account when it is flush than when it is low, an “ostrich effect”
(Karlsson et al. 2009; Sicherman et al. 2016). The evidence is complex: in loss aversion,
people pay more attention to losses than gains, something prima facie opposite to a selfserving attention bias. Hopefully future research will clarify this.
Let me propose the following simple model of motivated attention. Paying attention mi
to dimension i gives a psychic utility uxi xi φ (mi ), for some increasing function φ. Note that
xi is “good news” iff uxi xi ≥ 0 (as a small innovation xi creates a change in utility uxi xi ).

46

(51)

This is as in (35), but with the extra term for motivated cognition, µuxi xi . It implies that
the agent pays more attention to “good news” (i.e. news with uxi xi ≥ 0), with a particular
strength µ of motivated cognition that might be empirically evaluated. For instance, in the
P
basic quadratic problem the traditional action is ar = ni=1 bi xi , and the behavioral action

Yet another model is that people might be monitoring information but are mindful of
their loss aversion, i.e. avoid “bad news”, along the lines of Kőszegi and Rabin (2009),
Olafsson and Pagel (2017) and Andries and Haddad (2017).
4.3.3

Other decision-theoretic models of bounded rationality

In the spirit of “model substitution”, interesting work of the “bounded rationality” tradition
include Jehiel’s (2005) analogy-based equilibrium (which has generated a sizable literature),
and work of Compte and Postlewaite (2017).

4.4

Limitation of these models

These models are of course limited. They do not feature a refined “cost” of attention:
for example, why it’s harder to pay attention to tax changes than a funny story remains
unmodeled.
Attention can be controlled, but not fully. For instance, consider someone who had a bad
breakup, and can’t help thinking about it during an exam. That doesn’t seem fully optimal,
but (in the same way that paying attention to pain is generally useful, but one would like
to be able to stop paying attention to pain once under torture) this may be optimal given
some constraints on the design of attention.

This notion of “bottom-up attention” may be modeled in a way similar to the “topdown attention” that is the center of this paper. Instead of the attention responding as
m∗i =Aα (Ii ) to the “deep” usefulness Ii of a piece of information (as captured by (35) with
Ii = σi2 |axi uaa axi | /κ), the agent might rely on the “surface” usefulness of that information,
e.g. it’s written in red, and in a large font, or with some “emotional” characteristics (that is,

she might use a default attention m∗i =Aα Iid , where Iid = γ 0 Yi , for some vector Yi related
to the characteristics of information i). Itti and Koch (2000) is an influential empirical model
of such visual characteristics.
Rather than seeing those objections as fatal flaws, we shall see them as interesting research
challenges.

A Behavioral Update of Basic Microeconomics: Consumer Theory, Arrow-Debreu

Here I present a behavioral version of basic microeconomics, based on limited attention. It
is based on Gabaix (2014). Its structure does not, however, depends on the details of the
endogenization of attention (i.e. from sparsity or some other procedure). Hence, the analysis
applies to a large set of behavioral models, provided they incorporate some inattention to
prices.

5.1
5.1.1

Textbook consumer theory
Basic consumer theory: Marshallian demand

We are now ready to see how textbook consumer theory changes for this partially inattentive
agent. The rational consumer’s Marshallian demand is:
c (p, w) := arg maxn u (c) subject to p · c ≤ w
c∈R

(53)

where c and p are the consumption vector and price vector. We denote by cr (p, w) the
demand under the traditional r ational model, and by cs (p, w) the demand of a behavioral
agent (the s stands for: demand given “subjectively perceived prices”).
The price of good i is pi = pdi + xi , where pdi is the default price (e.g., the average price)
and xi is the deviation between the default price and the true price, as in Section 2.3.1. The
price perceived by a behavioral agent is psi = pdi + mi xi , i.e.:
psi (m) = mi pi + (1 − mi ) pdi .

(54)

When mi = 1, the agent fully perceives price pi , while when mi = 0, he replaces it by the
48

default price.68
Proposition 5.1 (Marshallian demand). Given the true price vector p and the perceived
price vector ps , the Marshallian demand of a behavioral agent is
cs (p, w) = cr (ps , w0 ) ,

(55)

where the as-if budget w0 solves p · cr (ps , w0 ) = w, i.e. ensures that the budget constraint is
exactly satisfied under the true price (if there are several such w0 , take the largest one).
To obtain intuition, we start with an example.
Example 2 (Demand by a behavioral agent with quasi-linear utility). Take u (c) =
v (c1 , ..., cn−1 ) + cn , with v strictly concave, and assume that the price of good n is correctly
perceived. Demand for good i < n is independent of wealth and is: csi (p) = cri (ps ).
In this example, the demand of the behavioral agent is the rational demand given the
perceived price (for all goods but the last one). The residual good n is the “shock absorber”
that adjusts to the budget constraint. In a dynamic context, this good n could be “savings”.
Here it is a polar opposite to quasilinear demand.
Example 3 (Demand proportional to wealth). When rational demand is proportional to
cr (ps ,w)
wealth, the demand of a behavioral agent is: csi (p, w) = p·ci r (ps ,1) .
Example 4 (Demand by behavioral Cobb-Douglas and CES agents). When u (c) =
Pn

When instead u (c) =
i=1 αi ln ci , with αi ≥ 0, demand is: ci (p, w) = psi P αj psj .

Pn 1−1/η
/ (1 − 1/η), with η > 0, demand is: csi (p, w) = (psi )−η P w s −η .
i=1 ci
j pj (pj )
More generally, say that the consumer goes to the supermarket, with a budget of w =
$100. Because of the lack of full attention to prices, the value of the basket in the cart
is actually $101. When demand is linear in wealth, the consumer buys 1% less of all the
goods, to hit the budget constraint, and spends exactly $100 (this is the adjustment factor
100
1/p · cr (ps , 1) = 101
). When demand is not necessarily linear in wealth, the adjustment
r
is (to the leading order) proportional to the income effect, ∂c
, rather than to the current
∂w
basket, cr . The behavioral agent cuts “luxury goods”, not “necessities”.69
68

More general functions psi (m) could be devised. For instance, perceptions can be in percentage terms,
i.e. in logs, ln psi (m) = mi ln pi +(1 − mi ) ln pdi . The main results go through with this log-linear formulation,
∂ps
= mi .
because in both cases, ∂pii

|p=p

For instance, the consumer at the supermarket might come to the cashier, who’d tell him that he is over
budget by $1. Then, the consumer removes items from the cart (e.g. lowering the as-if budget w0 by $1),
and presents the new cart to the cashier, who might now say that he’s $0.10 under budget. The consumers
now will adjust his consumption a bit (increase w0 by $0.10). This demand here is the convergence point
of this “tatonnement” process. In computer science language, the agent has access to an “oracle” (like the
cashier) telling him if he’s over- or under budget.

5.1.2

Asymmetric Slutsky matrix, and inferring attention from choice data,
and nominal illusion,

The Slutsky matrix The Slutsky matrix is an important object, as it encodes both
elasticities of substitution and welfare losses from distorted prices. Its element Sij is the
(compensated) change in consumption of ci as price pj changes:
Sij (p, w) :=

∂ci (p, w) ∂ci (p, w)
+
cj (p, w) .
∂pj
∂w

(56)

With the traditional agent, the most surprising fact about it is that it is symmetric:
r
. Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green (1995, p.70) comment: “Symmetry is not easy
Sijr = Sji
to interpret in plain economic terms. As emphasized by Samuelson (1947), it is a property
just beyond what one would derive without the help of mathematics.”
Now, if a prediction is non-intuitive to Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green, it might require
too much sophistication from the average consumer. We now present a less rational, and
psychologically more intuitive, prediction.
Proposition 5.2 (Slutsky matrix). Evaluated at the default price, the Slutsky matrix S s is,
compared to the traditional matrix S r :
Sijs = Sijr mj ,

(57)

i.e. the behavioral demand sensitivity to price j is the rational one, times mj , the salience of
price j. As a result the behavioral Slutsky matrix is not symmetric in general. Sensitivities
corresponding to “non-salient” price changes (low mj ) are dampened.
Proof sketch. For simplicity, here I only show the proof in the the quasi-linear case
of Example 2, when the price of the last good is correctly perceived at 1. We call C =
(c1 , . . . , cn−1 ), so that u (C, cn ) = v (C) + cn , and set P = (p1 , . . . , pn−1 ). We restrict our
attention to good i, j < n. The consumer’s first order condition is vci = psi , i.e. v 0 (C) = P s ,
so the demand is C s (P s ) = C r (P s ), where C (P ) = v 0−1 (P ) is the rational demand.
∂cs (p,w)
Then, Sij = i∂pj , as there is no income effect (by the way, that expression allows to verify
that the Slutsky matrix is symmetric in the rational case). So, evaluating the derivatives at

This gives the result. 
Instead of looking at the full price change, the consumer just reacts to a fraction mj of it.
Hence, he’s typically less responsive than the rational agent. For instance, say that mi > mj ,
so that the price of i is more salient than price of good j. The model predicts that Sijs is
50

s
lower than Sji
: as good j’s price isn’t very salient, quantities don’t react much to it. When
mj = 0, the consumer does not react at all to price pj , hence the substitution effect is zero.
The asymmetry of the Slutsky matrix indicates that, in general, a behavioral consumer
cannot be represented by a rational consumer who simply has different tastes or some adjustment costs. Such a consumer would have a symmetric Slutsky matrix.
To the best of my knowledge, this is the first derivation of an asymmetric Slutsky matrix
in a model of bounded rationality.70
Equation (57) makes tight testable predictions. It allows us to infer attention from choice
data, as we shall now see.71

Proposition 5.3 (Estimation of limited attention). Choice data allows one to recover the
attention vector m, up to a multiplicative factor m. Indeed, supposethatan empirical Slutsky

The underlying “rational” matrix can be recovered as Sijr := Sijs /mj , and it should be
symmetric, a testable implication.72 There is a old literature estimating Slutsky matrices
– but it had not explored the role of non-salient prices (a recent exception is the nascent
literature mentioned in Section 3.1.2).
It would be interesting to test Proposition 5.2 directly. The extant evidence is qualitatively encouraging, via the literature on tax salience and shrouded attributes (Sections
3.2.1-3.2.2), and the recent literature exploring this Slutsky asymmetry (Section 3.1.2).

This means that, though substitution effects are dampened, income effects ( ∂w
) are

Nominal illusion Recall that the consumer “sees” only a part mj of the price change (eq.
(54)). One consequence is nominal illusion.
70

Browning and Chiappori (1998) have in mind a very different phenomenon: intra-household bargaining,
with full rationality.

The Slutsky
 matrix does not allow one to recover m: for any m, S admits a ddilated factorization

Sij = m Sij (mmj )). To recover m, one needs to see how the demand changes as p varies. Aguiar and
Serrano (2017) explore further the link between Slutsky matrix and bounded rationality.
72
Here, we find again a less intuitive aspect of the Slutsky matrix.

51

Proposition 5.5 (Nominal illusion) Suppose that the agent pays more attention to some
goods than others (i.e. the mi are not all equal). Then, the agent exhibits nominal illusion,
i.e. the Marshallian demand c (p, w) is (generically) not homogeneous of degree 0.
To gain intuition, suppose that prices and the budget all increase by 10%. For a rational
consumer, nothing really changes and he picks the same consumption. However, consider a
behavioral consumer who pays more attention to good 1 (m1 > m2 ). He perceives that the
price of good 1 has increased more than the price of good 2 has (he perceives that they have
respectively increased by m1 · 10% vs m2 · 10%). So, he perceives that the relative price of
good 1 has increased (pd is kept constant). Hence, he consumes less of good 1, and more
of good 2. His demand has shifted. In abstract terms, cs (χp, χw) 6= cs (p, w) for χ = 1.1,
i.e. the Marshallian demand is not homogeneous of degree 0. The agent exhibits nominal
illusion.73

5.2

Textbook competitive equilibrium theory

We next revisit the textbook chapter on competitive equilibrium, with less than fully rational
agents. We will use the following notation. Agent a ∈ {1, ..., A} has endowment ω a ∈ Rn
(i.e. he is endowed with ωia units of good i), with n > 1. If the price is p, his wealth is p · ω a ,
so his demand is D a (p) := ca (p, p · ω a ). The economy’s excess demand function is Z (p) :=

PA
a
a
∗
n
a=1 D (p) − ω . The set of equilibrium prices is P := p ∈ R++ : Z (p) = 0 . The set of
equilibrium allocations for a consumer a is C a := {D a (p) : p ∈ P ∗ }. The equilibrium exists
under weak conditions laid out in Debreu (1970).
5.2.1

First and second welfare theorems: (In)efficiency of equilibrium

We start with the efficiency of Arrow-Debreu competitive equilibrium, i.e. the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics.74 We assume that competitive equilibria are interior,
and consumers are locally non-satiated.
Proposition 5.6 (First fundamental theorem of welfare economics revisited: (In)efficiency
of competitive equilibrium). An equilibrium is Pareto efficient if and only if the perception
of relative prices is identical across agents. In that sense, the first welfare theorem generally
fails.
Hence, typically the equilibrium is not Pareto efficient when we are not at the default
price. The intuitive argument is very simple (the appendix has a rigorous proof): recall
73

See Eyster et al. (2017) for progress on the impact of nominal illusion from inattention.
This chapter does not provide the producer’s problem, which is quite similar and is left for a companion
paper (and is available upon request). Still, the two negative results in Propositions 5.6 and 5.7 apply to
exchange economies, hence apply a fortiori to production economies.

The second welfare theorem asserts that any desired Pareto efficient allocation (ca )a=1...A
can be reached, after appropriate budget transfers (for a formal statement, see e.g., MasColell, Whinston, and Green 1995, section 16.D). The next Proposition asserts that it generally fails in this behavioral economy. The intuition is as follows: typically, if the first welfare
theorem fails, then a fortiori the second welfare theorem fails, as an equilibrium is typically
not efficient.
Proposition 5.7 (Second theorem of welfare economics revisited). The second welfare theorem generically fails, when there are strictly more than two consumers or two goods.
5.2.2

Excess volatility of prices in an behavioral economy

To tractably analyze prices, we follow the macro tradition, and assume in this section that
there is just one representative agent. A core effect is the following.
Bounded rationality leads to excess volatility of equilibrium prices. Suppose that there
are two dates, and that there is a supply shock: the endowment ω (t) changes between t = 0
and t = 1. Let dp = p (1) − p (0) be the price change caused by the supply shock, and
consider the case of infinitesimally small changes (to deal with the arbitrariness of the price
level, assume that p1 = pd1 at t = 1). We assume mi > 0 (and will derive it soon).
Proposition 5.8 (Bounded rationality leads to excess volatility of prices). Let dp[r] and
dp[s] be the change in equilibrium price in the rational and behavioral economies, respectively.
Then:
[r]
dp
[s]
dpi = i ,
(61)
mi
i.e., after a supply shock, the movements of price i in the behavioral economy are like the
movements in the rational economy, but amplified by a factor m1i ≥ 1. Hence, ceteris paribus,
53

the prices of non-salient goods are more volatile. Denoting by σik the price volatility in the

rational (k = r) or behavioral (k = s) economy, we have σis = mii .
Hence, non-salient prices need to be more volatile to clear the market. This might
explain the high price volatility of many goods, such as commodities. Consumers are quite
price inelastic, because they are inattentive. In a behavioral world, demand underreacts to
shocks; but the market needs to clear, so prices have to overreact to supply shocks.75

5.3

What is robust in basic microeconomics?

I distinguish what appears to be robust and not robust in the basic microeconomic theory of
consumer behavior and competitive equilibrium – when the specific deviation is a sparsityseeking agent. I use the sparsity benchmark not as “the truth,” of course, but as a plausible
extension of the traditional model, when agents are less than fully rational. I contrast the
traditional (or “classical”) model to a behavioral model with inattention.
Propositions that are not robust
Tradition: There is no money illusion. Behavioral model: There is money illusion: when
the budget and prices are both increased by 5%, the agent consumes less of goods with
a salient price (which he perceives to be relatively more expensive); Marshallian demand
c (p, w) is not homogeneous of degree 0.
Tradition: The Slutsky matrix is symmetric. Behavioral model: It is asymmetric, as
elasticities to non-salient prices are attenuated by inattention.
Tradition: The competitive equilibrium allocation is independent of the price level. Behavioral model: Different aggregate price levels lead to materially different equilibrium allocations, as implied by a Phillips curve.
Greater robustness: Objects are very close around the default price, up to
second order terms
Tradition: People maximize their “objective” welfare. Behavioral model: people maximize in default situations, but there are losses away from it.
Tradition: Competitive equilibrium is efficient, and the two Arrow-Debreu welfare theorems hold. Behavioral model: Competitive equilibrium is efficient if it happens at the
default price. Away from the default price, competitive equilibrium has inefficiencies, unless
all agents have the same misperceptions. As a result, the two welfare theorems do not hold
in general.
Traditional economics gets the signs right – or, more prudently put, the signs predicted
by the rational model (e.g. Becker-style price theory) are robust under a sparsity variant.
Those predictions are of the type “if the price of good 1 goes down, demand for it goes

Gul, Pesendorfer, and Strzalecki (2017) offer a very different model leading to volatile prices, with a
different mechanism linked to endogenous heterogeneity between agents.

54

up”, or more generally “if there’s a good incentive to do X, people will indeed tend to
do X.”76,77 Those sign predictions make intuitive sense, and, not coincidentally, they hold
in the behavioral model:78 those sign predictions (unlike quantitative predictions) remain
unchanged even when the agent has a limited, qualitative understanding of his situation.
Indeed, when economists think about the world, or in much applied microeconomic work, it
is often the sign predictions that are used and trusted, rather than the detailed quantitative
predictions.

Models with Stochastic Attention and Choice of Precision

We now move on to models with noisy signals. They are more complex to handle, as they
provide a stochastic prediction, not a deterministic one. There are pros and cons to that.
One pro is that economists can stick to optimal information processing. In addition, the
amount of noise may actually be a guide to the thought process, hence might be a help
rather than a hindrance: see Glimcher (2011) and Caplin (2016). The drawback is basically
the complexity of this approach – these models become quickly intractable.
Interestingly, much of the neuroeconomics (Glimcher and Fehr 2013) and cognitive psychology (Gershman, Horvitz, and Tenenbaum 2015; Griffiths, Lieder, and Goodman 2015)
literatures sees the brain as an optimal information processor. Indeed, for low-level processes
(e.g. vision), the brain may well be optimal, though for high-level processes (e.g. dealing
with the stock market) it is not directly optimal.

6.1

Bayesian models with choice of information

There are many Bayesian models in which agents pay to get more precise signals. An early
example is Verrecchia (1982): agents pay to receive more precise signals in a financial market.
In Geanakoplos and Milgrom (1991), managers pay for more information. They essentially all
work with linear-quadratic settings – otherwise the task is intractable. In the basic problem
of Section 2.1, the expected loss is


76

Those predictions need not be boring. For instance, when divorce laws are relaxed, spouses kill each
other less (Stevenson and Wolfers 2006).
77
This is true for “direct” effects, though not necessarily once indirect effects are taken into account. For
instance, this is true for compensated demand (see the part on the Slutsky matrix), and in partial equilibrium.
This is not necessarily true for uncompensated demand (where income effects arise) or in general equilibrium
– though in many situations those “second round” effects are small.
78
The closely related notion of strategic complements and substitutes (Bulow, Geanakoplos, and Klemperer
1985) is also robust to a sparsity deviation.

55

so that the agent’s problem is:
1
τ
max − (1 − m) σx2 − κG (τ ) subject to m =

2
1+τ
2

where τ = σσx2 is the relative precision of the signal, and G is the cost of precision, which is
ε
increasing. This can be equivalently reformulated as:
1
max − (1 − m) σx2 − κg (m)
m
2

m
by defining g (m) appropriately (g (m) := G 1−m
). So, we have a problem very much like
(33).
This allows us to think about the optimal choice of information. When actions are
strategic complements, you can get multiple equilibria in information gathering (Hellwig
and Veldkamp 2009). When actions are strategic substitutes, you often obtain specialization
in information (Van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp 2010). More generally, rational information acquisition models do seem to predict qualitatively relevant features of real markets
(Kacperczyk, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Veldkamp 2016).

6.2

Entropy-based inattention: “Rational inattention”

Sims (1998, 2003) extends the ideas to allow for larger choice sets in which agents freely
choose the properties of their signals. He uses the entropy penalty to handle non-Gaussian
variables.
6.2.1

Information theory: A crash course

Here is a brief introduction to information theory, as developed by Shannon (1948). The
basic textbook for this is Cover and Thomas (2006).
Discrete variables Take a random variable X with probability pi of a value xi . Throughout, we will use the notation f to refer to the probability mass function of a given random
variable (when discrete), or to its probability density function (when continuous). Then the
entropy of X for the discrete case is defined as
H (X) = −E [log f (X)] = −

X

pi log pi

i

so that H ≥ 0 (for a discrete variable; it won’t be true for a continuous variable). In the
case where uncertainty between outcomes is greatest, X can take n equally probable values,

56

pi = n1 . This distribution gives the maximum entropy,
H (X) = log n
which illustrates that higher uncertainty yields higher entropy.
This measure of “complexity” is really a measure of the complexity of communication,
not of finding or processing information. For instance, the entropy of a coin flip is log 2 –
one bit if we use the base 2 logarithm. But also, suppose that you have to communicate the
√
value of the 1000th figure in the binary expansion of 17. Then, the entropy of that is again
simply log 2. This is the not the cost of actually processing information (which is a harder
thing to model), just the cost of transmitting the information.
Suppose we have two independent random variables, with X = (Y, Z). Then, f X (y, z) =
f Y (y) f Z (z) so




H (X) = −E log f X (X) = −E log f Y (Y ) f Z (Z)


= −E log f Y (Y ) + log f Z (Z)
H (X) = H (Y ) + H (Z) .

(62)

This shows that the information of independent outcomes is additive. The next concept
is that of mutual information, for which we drop the assumption that the two variables of
interest are independent. It is defined by the reduction of entropy of X when you know Y :
I (X, Y ) = H (X) − H (X|Y )







X
Y
= −E log f (X) + log f (Y ) + E [log f (X, Y )]
= H (X) + H (Y ) − H (X, Y ) = I (Y, X) ,

and so it follows that mutual information is symmetric. The next concept is the KullbackLeibler divergence between two distributions p, q,
P

D (pkq) = E



 X
p (X)

log

q (X)

(63)

Note that the Kullback-Leibler divergence is not actually a proper distance, since D (pkq) 6=
D (qkp), but it is similar to a distance – it is nonnegative, and equal to 0 when p = q.
Hence, we have:
 X
I (X, Y ) = D f (x, y) kf X (x) f Y (y) =
f (x, y) log
x,y

57

f (x, y)
,
f X (x) f Y (y)

(64)

or, in other words, mutual information I (X, Y ) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between
the full joint probability f (x, y) and its “decoupled” approximation f X (x) f Y (y).
Continuous variables With continuous variables with density f (x), entropy is defined
to be:
Z
H (X) = −E [log f (X)] = − f (x) log f dx
with the convention that f (x)logf (x) = 0 if f (x) = 0. For instance, if X is a uniform [a, b],
1
1x∈[a,b] and
then f (x) = b−a
H (X) = log (b − a)
(65)
which shows that we can have a negative entropy, (H (X) < 0) with continuous variables.
If Y = a + σX, then because f Y (y) dy = f X (x) dx, i.e. f Y (y) = σ1 f X (x), we have




H (Y ) = −E log f Y (Y ) = −E log f X (X) + log σ
H (Y ) = H (X) + log σ

(66)

so with continuous variables, multiplying a variable by σ increases its entropy by log σ.
The entropy of a Gaussian N (µ, σ 2 ) variable is, as shown in Appendix A,
H (X) =

1
1
log σ 2 + log (2πe)
2
2

(67)

and for a multi-dimensional Gaussian with variance-covariance matrix V , the entropy is
H (X) =

1
n
log (det V ) + log (2πe)
2
2

(68)

which is analogous to the one-dimensional formula, but σ 2 is replaced by det V .
Mutual information in a Gaussian case Suppose X, Y are jointly Gaussian with correlation ρ. Then, their mutual information is
I (X, Y ) =

1
1
log
2
1 − ρ2

(69)

so that the mutual information is increasing in the correlation.
6.2.2

Using Shannon entropy as a measure of cost

Sims (2003) proposed the following problem, which had two innovations: the use of entropy,
and a reformulation of the choice of the signal structure (both of which can be generalized).
Consider an agent that has no information or attention costs and makes choices by maximizing u (a, x). In the Sims version, the agent will pick a stochastic action A drawn from an
58

endogenously chosen density q (a|x) – i.e., the probability density of a given the true state
is x – where q is chosen by the optimization problem
Z
max u (a, x) q (a|x) f (x) da dx s.t. I (A, X) ≤ K,
(70)
q(a|x)

that is, the agent instructs some black box to give him a stochastic action: the box sees the
true x, and then returns a noisy prescription q (a|x) for his action.79 Of course, the nature
of this black box is a bit unclear, but may be treated as some thought process.80
A simple example To get a feel for this problem, revisit the “targeting problem” seen
above, where x ∼ N (0, σ 2 ), and u (a, x) = − 12 (a − x)2 . The solution is close to that in
Section 2.1: the agent receives a noisy signal s = x + ε, and takes the optimal action
2
a (s) = E [x|s] = mx + mε with m = σ2σ+σ2 . The loss utility achieved is:
ε

1
1
U = E [u (a (s) , x)] = − (mx + mε − x)2 = − (1 − m) σ 2
2
2

(71)

The analytics in (92) shows that ρ2 = corr (a (s) , x)2 = m, and using equation (69), the
1
1
1
mutual information is I (a (s) , x) = 12 log 1−ρ
2 = 2 log 1−m . Hence, the decision problem (70)
boils down to:
1
1
1
max − (1 − m) σ 2 s.t.
log
≤K
m
2
2
1−m
This gives:

m = 1 − e−2K

(72)

and the action has the form:
aSims = mx + η
with η = mε. So, we get a solution as in the basic problem of Section 4.1, with a cost
1
function C (m) = 21 log 1−m
.
If we wish to calibrate an attention m ≤ 0.9, equation (72) implies that we need K ≤
− log(1−m)
, which gives K ≤ 1.15 “natural units” or a capacity of at most 1.7 bits. This is a
2
very small capacity.
Extensions to multiple dimensions Now, let us see the multidimensional version, with
P
the basic quadratic problem (11): u (a, x) = − 12 (a − ni=1 bi xi )2 . We assume that the xi are
uncorrelated, jointly Gaussian, that Var (xi ) = σi2 . Then, one can show that the solution
79

The density chosen is non-parametric, and does not involve explicitly sending intermediary signals as in
the prior literature – which is an innovation by Sims (2003).
80
In the Shannon theory, this nature is clear. Originally, the Shannon theory is a theory of communication.
Someone has information x at one end of the line, and needs to communicate information a at the other end
of the line. Under the setup of the Shannon theory, the cost is captured by the mutual information I (A, X).

59

takes the form
aSims = m

X

bi x i + η

(73)

i

with a η orthogonal to the x.
This may be a good place to contrast the Sims approach and sparsity. For the same
quadratic problem, Equation (37) yields
s

a =

n
X

mi bi xi

(74)

i=1

so that the agent can pay more attention to source 1 than to source 10 (if m1 > m10 ). Hence,
with the global entropy constraint of Sims we obtain uniform dampening across all variables
(i.e. mi = m for all i in equation (73)) – not source-specific dampening as in (37)-(74).81
Now, a drawback of sparsity (and related models like Bordalo et al. (2013)) is that
framing (in the sense of partitioning of attributes into dimensions) matters in this model,
whereas it does not in the Sims approach. This is important to its ability to generate nonuniform dampening across dimensions. On the other hand, this seems realistic: in the base
example of the price with a tax (section 2.3.2), it does matter empirically whether the price
is presented as two items (price, tax), or as one composite information price plus tax.
Discussion One advantage of the entropy-based approach is that we have a universally
applicable measure of the cost of information. In simple linear-quadratic-Gaussian cases, the
models are similar (except for the important fact that Sims generates uniform, rather than
source-dependent, dampening). When going away from this linear-quadratic-Gaussian case,
the modeling complexity of sparsity remains roughly constant (and attention still obtains in
closed form). In Sims, this is not the case, and quickly problems become extremely hard to
solve. For instance, in Jung, Kim, Matějka, and Sims (2015), the solution has atoms – it is
non-smooth. One needs a computer to solve it.82 All in all, it is healthy for economics that
different approaches are explored in parallel.
Sims called this modelling approach “rational inattention”. This name may be overly
broad, as Sims really proposed a particular modelling approach, not at all the general notion
that attention allocation responds to incentives. That notion comes from the 1960s and
information economics–dating back at least to Stigler (1961), where agents maximize utility
subject to the cost of acquiring information, so that information and attention responds
to costs and benefits. There are many papers under that vein, e.g. Verrecchia (1982);
Geanakoplos and Milgrom (1991). Hence, a term such as “entropy-based inattention” seems
81

There is a “water-filling” result in information theory that generates source-dependent attention, but it
requires different channels, not the Sims unitary attention channel.
82
This is can be seen as a drawback, but Matějka (2016) proposes that this can be used to model pricing
with a discrete set of prices.

60

like a proper name for the specific literature initiated by Sims.83
Still, a great virtue of the entropy-based approach is that it has attracted the energy
of many economists, especially in macro (Maćkowiak and Wiederholt 2009, 2015; Veldkamp
2011; Khaw, Stevens, and Woodford 2016), e.g. to study the inattention to the fine determinants of pricing by firms. Many depart from the “global entropy penalty,” which allows one
to have source-specific inattention. But then, there is no real reason to stick to the entropy
penalty in the first place–other cost functions will work similarly. Hence researchers keep
generalizing the Shannon entropy, for instance Caplin, Dean, and Leahy (2017); Ellis (2018).

Random choice via limited attention
Limited attention as noise in perception: Classic perspective

A basic model is the random choice model. The consumer must pick one of n goods. Utility
is vi , drawn from a distribution f (v) . In the basic random utility model à la Luce-McFadden
(Manski and McFadden 1981), the probability of choosing vi is
evi /σ
pi = P vj /σ ,
je

(75)

with the following classic microfoundation: agents receive a signal
si = vi + σεi

(76)
−x

where the εi are i.i.d. with a Gumbel distribution, P (εi ≤ x) = e−e . The idea is that εi
is noise in perception, and perhaps it could be decreased actively by agents, or increased by
firms.
Agents have diffuse priors on vi . Hence, they choose the good j with the highest signal

st , pi = P i ∈ argmaxj sj . With Gumbel noise, this leads (after some calculations as in
e.g. Anderson, De Palma, and Thisse 1992) to (75). When the noise scaling parameter σ
is higher, there is more uncertainty; when σ → ∞, then pi → n1 . The choice is completely
random.
This is a useful model, because it captures in a simple way “noisy perceptions”. It has
proven very useful in industrial organization (e.g. Anderson, De Palma, and Thisse 1992) –
where the typical interpretation is “rational differences in tastes”, rather than “noise in the
perception”. It can be generalized in a number of ways, including with correlated noises, and
non-Gumbel noise (Gabaix et al. 2016). This framework can be used to analyze equilibrium
prices when consumers are confused and/or when firms create noise to confuse consumers.
Then, the equilibrium price markup (defined as price minus cost) is generally proportional

6.3.2

Random choice via entropy penalty

Matějka and McKay (2015) derive an entropy-based foundation for the logit model. In its
simplest form, the idea is as follows. The consumer must pick one of n goods. Utility is
vi , drawn from a distribution f (v) . The endogenous probability of choosing i is pi . The
problem is to maximize utility subject to a penalty for having an inaccurate probability:
"
max
(pi (v))i=1...n

E

#
X
i

pi (v) vi − κD P kP d




where the expectation is taken over the value of v, and D P kP d is the Kullback-Leibler
distance between the probability and a default probability, P d . Hence, we have a penalty
for a “sophisticated” probability distribution that differs from the default probability.84 So,
the Lagrangian is

so this is like (75), with σ replaced by κ, and with default probabilities being uniform. When
the cost κ is 0, then the agent is the classical rational agent.

Matějka and McKay’s setup (2015) actually gives the default: max(pd ) E log
i pi e
i
P d
s.t. i pi = 1. So, when the vi are drawn from the same distribution, pdi = 1/n.
In some cases, some options will not even be looked at, so pdi = 0. This gives a theory of
consideration sets. For related work, see Masatlioglu, Nakajima, and Ozbay (2012); Manzini
and Mariotti (2014); Caplin, Dean, and Leahy (2016). This in turn helps explore dynamic
problems, as in Steiner, Stewart, and Matějka (2017).

Allocation of Attention over Time

The models discussed so far were static. We now move on to models that incorporate
the allocation of attention over time. One important theme is that people are initially
inattentive to a new piece of information, but over time they adjust to the news – a form
of “sluggishness”. I cover different ways to generate sluggishness, particularly over time.
They are largely substitutes for inattention from a modeling standpoint, but they generate
sometimes different predictions, as we shall see.

7.1
7.1.1

Generating sluggishness: Sticky action, sticky information,
and habits
Sticky action and sticky information

The most common models are those of sticky action and sticky information. In the sticky
action model, agents need to pay a cost to change their action. In the sticky information
model, agents need to pay a cost to change their information. Sticky action has been advocated in macroeconomics by Calvo (1983) and Caballero (1995), and in a finance context
by Duffie and Sun (1990) and Lynch (1996). Sticky information has been advocated in
macro by Gabaix and Laibson (2002), Carroll (2003), and then by Mankiw and Reis (2002),
Reis (2006a), Bacchetta and Van Wincoop (2010) and numerous authors since. Coibion and
Gorodnichenko (2015) finds evidence for slow adjustment to information. Intuitively, this
generates sluggishness in the aggregate action. To see this, consider the following tracking
problem. The agent should maximize
V

=

∞
X

β t u (at , xt )

(78)

t=0

1
u (a, x) = − (a − x)2
2

(79)

where at is a decision variable, and xt an exogenous variable satisfying:
xt+1 = ρxt + εt+1

(80)

with |ρ| ≤ 1. In the frictionless version, the optimal action at date t is:
art = xt .
Simple case: Random walk To keep the math simple, take ρ = 1 at first. Consider
first the “sticky action” case. We will consider two benchmarks. In the “Calvo” model (as
in the pricing model due to Calvo (1983)) the agent changes her action only with a Poisson
63

probability 1 − θ at each period. In the “fixed delay D” model (as in Gabaix and Laibson
2002; Reis 2006a), the agent changes her action every D periods. Both models imply that
the action is changed with a lag.
I
Call aA
t,s (respectively at,s ) the action of an agent at time t, who re-optimized her action
(respectively, who refreshed her information) s periods ago, in the sticky Action model
(respectively, I nformation). Then
r
aA
t,s = at−s = xt−s

and
aIt,s = Et−s [art ] = xt−s .
Hence, in the random walk case, sticky action and sticky information make the same
prediction. However, when we go beyond the random walk, predictions are different (see
Section A.2).
So, consider the impact of a change in εt in xt , on the aggregate action
āt =

∞

f (s) at,s .

s=0

In the Calvo model, f (s) = (1 − θ) θs . In the “fixed delay D” model, f (s) =

in the updating-every-D periods model. Hence, we have a delayed reaction. This is the first
lesson. Models with sticky action, and sticky reaction, generate a sluggish, delayed response
in the aggregate action.
Put another way, in the Calvo model, aggregate dynamics are:
āt A = θāA
t−1 + (1 − θ) xt

(82)

and they are the same (in the random walk case that we are presently considering) in the
sticky information case.

64

7.1.2

Habit formation generates inertia

Macroeconomists who want to generate inertia often use habits. That is, instead of a utility
function u (at , xt ) , one uses a utility function

v (at, , at−1 , xt ) := u

at − hat−1
, xt
1−h


(83)

where h ∈ [0, 1) is a habit parameter. This is done in order to generate stickiness. To see
how, consider again the targeting problem (78), but with no frictions except for habit:
max −

∞
X
t=0

β

t



at − hat−1
− xt
1−h

2
.

The first best can be achieved simply by setting the square term to 0 at each date, e.g.
− xt = 0. That is,
at = hat−1 + (1 − h) xt
(84)

at −hat−1
1−h

which is exactly an AR(1) process, like (82), replacing θ by h. This is a sense in which a
habit model can generate the same behavior as a sticky action / information model. In more
general setups, the correspondence is not perfect, but it qualitatively carries over.
Macroeconomists have used this habit model to generate inertia in consumption, and
even in investment – see Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005). Havranek, Rusnak,
and Sokolova’s (2017) meta-analysis finds a median estimate of h = 0.5 for macro studies,
and h = 0.1 for micro studies. The discrepancy is probably due to the fact that at the micro
level there is so much volatility of consumption, that this is only consistent with a small
degree of habit formation. In macro studies, aggregate consumption is much smoother, so
aggregate sluggishness of the reaction to information results in a higher measured h.
Of course, for normative purposes the analysis is completely different. In the habit model
above, the agent achieves the first best utility. However, in the sticky information model, if
the agent could remove her friction (e.g. lower the stickiness θ to 0), she would do it. In a
more complex macro model, the same holds. Likewise for optimal retirement savings policy,
the specific reason for people’s sensitivity to the default matters a great deal (Bernheim,
Fradkin, and Popov 2015).
Which is true? Most macroeconomists acknowledge that habits are basically just a device
to generate stickiness. Carroll, Crawley, Slacalek, Tokuoka, and White (2017) argue that
stickiness is indeed about inattention, rather than habits.

Adjustment costs generate inertia

Adjustment costs also generate inertia. Suppose that the problem is
max −
at

∞
X
t=0

β t [(at − xt )2 + κ (at − at−1 )2 ]

such that the first order condition with respect to at is
at − xt + κ (at − at−1 ) − βκ (Et at+1 − at ) = 0

(85)

so we obtain a second order difference equation. When xt is a random walk, we have
at = θat−1 + (1 − θ) xt

(86)

κ
.85 So, θ is 0 when κ = 0, and θ = 1 as κ → ∞.
where θ solves θ = κ+1+βκ(1−θ)
Hence again, adjustment costs yield an isomorphic behavior, but with a more complex
mathematical result, as θ has to be solved for.

7.1.4

Observable difference between inattention vs. habits / adjustment costs:
Source-specific inattention

Both inattention and habits / adjustment costs create delayed reaction. Let us see this in a
one-period model.
P
In an adjustment cost model, the agent solves maxa − (a − i bi xi )2 −κ (a − a−1 )2 , which
yields an action:
a = mar + (1 − m) a−1
(87)
with m =

1
.
1+κ

Likewise, a habit

max u
a


a − ha−1
,x
1−h

creates the same expression (87) for the action, this time with m = 1 − h.
85

Proof: we use (86) at t + 1, which gives
Eat+1 − at = (θ − 1) at + (1 − θ) Et xt+1 = (1 − θ) (xt − at ) .

Then, we plug it into (85),
0

= at − xt + κ (at − at−1 ) − βκ (Eat+1 − at )
= (1 + βκ (1 − θ)) (at − xt ) + κ (at − at−1 )

Solving for at , this implies (86) at time t, provided that θ =

66

κ
κ+1+βκ(1−θ) .

(88)

In contrast, inattention creates an action:
a=

X

mi bi xi .

i

Hence we can differentiate between them as follows. The presence of adjustment costs
(or the sticky action model) creates uniform under-reaction (mi = m for all i’s), while
inattention (of the sticky information kind) creates source-specific under-reaction (the mi in
general differ across i’s).
7.1.5

Dynamic default value

Within behavioral models, a simple way to model dynamic attention is via the default value.
For instance, the default value could jump to the optimal default value, with some Poisson
probability, much as in the sticky information model. In a Bayesian context, the “prior”
could be updated with some Poisson probability.

7.2

Optimal dynamic inattention

How to optimize the allocation of attention? The agent minimizes the following objective
function over the information acquisition policy, in which a denotes a state-contingent policy:
"
V (a, β) = −E

X
t≥0

(1 − β) β



(at − xt )2 + κCt
2

#

where Ct = 1 if a cost is paid, 0 otherwise. Here, to simplify calculations and concentrate on
the economics, we take the “timeless perspective”, and take the limit β → 1. That is, the
agent maximizes, over the adjustment policy, V (a) = limβ→1 V (a, β), that is


V (a) = −E
(at − xt )2 + κCt

which is the average consumption loss plus a penalty for the average cost of looking up
information.86

If the information is s periods old, then at,s − xt = su=1 εt−u , so

E (at,s − xt )2 = sσ 2

In the D model, the information is looked up every D periods. In the Calvo model, the probability of

I do know not of systematic evidence on this, although the research on this topic is
progressing vigorously (e.g. Alvarez, Lippi, and Paciello 2011; Alvarez, Gonzalez-Rozada,
Neumeyer, and Beraja 2016).

7.3
7.3.1

Other ways to generate dynamic adjustment
Procrastination

Another way to generate sluggishness is to use procrastination, as in Carroll, Choi, Laibson,
Madrian, and Metrick (2009). In this view, agents hope to act, but procrastinate for a
long time – because they are optimistic about their future behavior (O’Donoghue and Rabin
(1999)). A related issues is forgetting and lapsed attention. For instance, Ericson (2017) finds
that an important factor is that people overestimate the likelihood that they will remember
that they have to make a decision, which amplifies sluggishness (see also Ericson 2011).
7.3.2

Unintentional inattention

Most models are about fairly “intentional” attention – agents choose to pay attention
(though, given attention is dictated more so by System 1 than by System 2, in the language
of Kahneman (2003), the distinction isn’t completely clear cut). If unintentional inattention
is the first-order issue, how do we model that? A simple way would be to say that the agent
has the wrong “priors” over the importance of variable xi . That is, in truth σi is high, but
the agent thinks that σi is low – for instance, at the allocation of attention stage the agent
thinks that an employer’s retirement savings match rate is small. Concretely, at Step 1 in
Proposition 4.1, the agent might have too low a perception of σi . One could imagine an
iterated allocation problem, where the agent also optimizes over his perception of the costs
and benefits.
7.3.3

Slow accumulation of information with entropy-based cost

Sims (1998) was motivated by evidence for sluggish adjustment. Maćkowiak and Wiederholt
(2009, 2015) pursue that idea in macroeconomics – while breaking the unitary entropy of
Sims, such that agents are allowed to have heterogeneous attention to different news sources.
The dynamics are much more complex to derive, but are not unrealistic.

7.4

Behavioral macroeconomics

There has been a recent interest in behavioral macroeconomics. It is too early to present
a comprehensive survey of this literature. Themes includes rules of thumb (Campbell and
Mankiw 1989), limited information updating (Caballero 1995, Gabaix and Laibson 2002,
Mankiw and Reis 2002, Reis 2006a, Alvarez et al. (2011)), and noisy signals (Sims 2003,
69

Maćkowiak and Wiederholt 2015). A small but growing literature in theoretical macroeconomics draws consequences for general equilibrium and policy from features like inattention
and imperfect information (Woodford 2013; Garcı́a-Schmidt and Woodford 2015; Angeletos and Lian 2017, 2016; Farhi and Werning 2017; Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer 2016b).
For instance, Gabaix (2018) presents a behavioral version of the textbook New Keynesian
model, which gives a way to model monetary and fiscal policy with behavioral agents. There
is also a budding literature on limited attention by firms beyond the issues of price stickiness
(Goldfarb and Xiao (2016)). We can expect this literature to grow in the future.

8

Open Questions and Conclusion

The field of inattention has become extremely active. Here are some important open issues.
We need more measures of inattention, and go beyond rejecting the “full
attention” null hypothesis Currently, to produce one good measure of attention m, we
need a full paper. It would be nice to scale up production – in particular, to always attempt
to provide a quantitative measure of attention, rather than a demonstration that it is not
full.
Investigating Varian in the lab Consider the difference between a physics textbook
and a microeconomics textbook. In a physics textbook, assertions and results (e.g. force =
mass × acceleration) have been verified exquisitely in the lab. Not so in economics. When
one opens a textbook such as Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green (1995) or Varian (1992),
one is confronted with a few chapters that have been extensively investigated: for example,
expected utility (with prospect theory as a behavioral benchmark), or basic game theory,
with some behavioral models as an alternative (Camerer 2003). But other chapters, such as
basic microeconomics of the consumer-theory and Arrow-Debreu styles, have been investigated very little.88 One sees many assertions and predictions, with very few experimental
counterparts – and indeed, one suspects that the assertions will actually be wrong if they
are to be tested.
This is a result – I believe – of the lack of a systematic behavioral alternative. The
material in Section 5 fills this gap by proposing a behavioral counterpart of the major
parts of basic microeconomics, including directions in which inattention will modify the
rational predictions. It would be a great advance to implement procedures to investigate its
predictions empirically. Such a study would be very useful for economics.
88

There is a literature estimating GARP and Afriat’s theorem, but it is generally not guided by a specific behavioral alternative, so that “rejection of rationality” usually gives little guidance to a behavioral
alternative. See Aguiar and Serrano (2017) for progress on this, and the references therein to this strand of
literature.

70

The challenges are: (i) to implement a notion of “clearly perceived” and “more opaque”
prices, (ii) measure attention m, and (iii) implement in a roughly natural way the basic
problem (53). The outcome of this would be very valuable, as we would then have a workedout and tested counterpart of basic microeconomics.
We need more experimental evidence on the determinants of attention There
are now several theories of attention, but measurement is somewhat lagging in refinement
(the reason is that it is already hard to measure attention in the first place, so that the study
of the determinants of attention is even harder). What’s the cost of inattention? Could we
get some sense of the shape of the cost, and of the attention function (e.g. that in Figure
1)? At a more basic level, the global-entropy constraint à la Sims predicts a unitary shadow
value of attention, as in equation (73), without source-dependent inattention. Other models,
e.g. behavioral models and older models where people pay for precision (Verrecchia 1982;
Veldkamp 2011), predict source-dependent inattention, as in (37). Other theories emphasize
the fact that attention is commodity- and action-dependent (Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer
2013). Empirical guidance would be useful.
More structural estimation The early papers found evidence for imperfect attention,
with large economic effects. A more recent wave of papers has estimated inattention – its
mean, variance, and how it varies with income, education and the like. A third generation
of papers might estimate more structural models of inattention, to see if the predictions do
fit, and perhaps suggest newer models.
Using this to do better policy: generating attention All this work may lead to
progress in how to generate attention, e.g. for policy. Making consumers more rational is
difficult even when the right incentives are in place – for example, consumers overwhelmingly
fail to minimize fees in allocating their portfolios (Choi, Laibson, and Madrian 2009). The
work on nudges (Thaler and Sunstein 2008) is based on psychological intuition rather than
quantified principles. Also, knowing better “best practices” for disclosure would be helpful.
Firms are good at screening for consumer biases (Ru and Schoar 2016), but public institutions
less so, and debiasing is quite hard.

Further Derivations

Basic signal-extraction problem (Section 2.1) We have s = x + ε. So E [x|s] = ms,
with m = Cov(x,s)
= vvxs , with vx = σx2 and vs = σx2 + σε2 . Hence, the optimal a = E [x|s] is
Var(s)

a = ms = mx + mε. A little bit of algebra gives vε = vs − vx = vx m1 − 1 and
Var (mε) = m2 vε = m (1 − m) vx
so a is distributed as:
a = mx +

p
m (1 − m)ηx

(92)

where ηx is another draw from the distribution of x. This implies Var (a) = mVar (x), and


E (a − x)2 = (1 − m) σx2 .
Derivation of the losses from inattention (equation (31)) Let us start with a 1dimensional action, with a utility function u (a) . Call a∗ the optimum. But the agent does
a = a∗ + â, where â is a deviation (perhaps coming from inattention). Then utility losses are
L (â) := u (a∗ + â) − u (a∗ ) .
Let’s do a Taylor expansion,
La (â) = u0 (a∗ + â) , Laa (â) = u00 (a∗ + â)

1
L (â) = L (0) + La (0) â + Laa (0) â2 + o â2
2
which implies L (0) = La (0) = 0. Hence:

1
L (â) = uaa (0) â2 + o â2 .
2
Next, for a small x, the deviation is
â = a∗ (xs ) − a∗ (x) = ax (xs − x) + o (x) = ax (m − 1) x + o (x)
hence, for a one-dimensional x, the loss is:


2L (x) = uaa (a∗ (x)) â2 + o â2 = uaa (a∗ (0)) â2 + o â2

= uaa a2x x2 (1 − m)2 + o |x|2 .
72

With an n−dimensional x, the math is similar, with matrices:
â = a∗ (xs ) − a∗ (x) = ax (xs − x) = ax (M − I) x + o (x)
with M = diag (m1 , ..., mn ), I the identity matrix of dimension n. So, neglecting o kâk2
terms,



2L = â0 uaa (0) â + o kâk2 = x0 (I − M )0 a0x uaa (0) ax (I − M ) x

We then obtain (31) by taking expectations.

Proof of Proposition 5.1 From Definition 4.3, the optimum satisfies: u0 (c) = λps for
some λ. Hence, this consumption is the consumption of a rational agent facing prices ps ,
and wealth w0 = ps · c.
Proof of Proposition 5.2 Here I show only the proof in the most transparent case – see
the original paper for the general case. Utility is u (c) = U (C) + cn , where C = (c1 , ..., cn−1 ),
and the price of good n is 1 and correctly perceived. Then, demand satisfies u0 (c) = λps .
Applying this to the last good gives 1 = λ. So, demand for the other goods satisfies
U 0 (C) = P s , where P = (p1 , . . . , pn ) . Differentiating w.r.t. P, U 00 (C) CPs = M , where
M = diag (m1 , . . . , mn−1 ) is the vector of attention to prices. Now, the Slutsky matrix (for
the goods 1, . . . , n − 1) is S s = CPs = U 00−1 (C) M , as all the income effects are absorbed by
i
the last good ( ∂c
= 0 for i < n). As a particular case where M = I, the rational Slutsky

matrix is S = U

Mathematical Complements

Here I provide some mathematical complements.
Dynamic attention: Beyond the random walk case Here I expand on Section 7.1,
beyond the random cases which made the analytics very transparent. I consider the case
(80) with ρ not necessarily equal to 1. The sticky action is a bit more delicate to compute.
Consider an agent who can change her action at time t. At period t + s, she will still have

Appendix: Data Methodology

This appendix outlines the details of the methodology used to compile the data in Table 1
and Figure 1, which present point estimates of the attention parameter m in a cross-section
of recent studies, alongside the estimated relative value of the opaque add-on attribute with
respect to the relevant good or quantity (τ /p).
• In the study of Allcott and Wozny (2014), we take τ to be the standard deviation
of the present discounted value of future gasoline costs in the authors’ sample; p is
correspondingly the standard deviation of vehicle price, such that τ = $4, 147 and
p = $9, 845. The point estimate for m is as reported by the authors.
• Hossain and Morgan (2006) and Brown, Hossain, and Morgan (2010) both conduct a
series of paired experiments by selling various goods on eBay and varying the shrouded
shipping costs. This setup allows us to deduce the implied degree of inattention,
following the same methodology as in DellaVigna (2009). We consider auction pairs
in which the auction setup and the sum of reserve price are held constant, while the
shipping cost is altered. As in DellaVigna (2009), we assume buyers are bidding their
true willingness to pay in eBay’s second price auctions, such that their bid is b = p+mτ ,
where p is the buyer’s valuation of the object and τ is the shipping cost. Seller’s revenue
is p+(1−m)c. Under this model, the ratio of the difference in revenues to the difference
in shipping costs across the two auction conditions corresponds to the quantity 1 − m.
The estimates for the attention parameter m in the experiments of Hossain and Morgan
(2006) are as reported in DellaVigna (2009). We use the same methodology to derive
the analogous estimate for the eBay Taiwan field experiment of Brown, Hossain, and
Morgan (2010). The raw implied estimate for the latter experimental setting is negative
(m = −0.43), as the mean revenue difference between the two auction conditions is
greater than the difference in shipping costs. For consistency with the definition of m
and in order to account for measurement error, we constrain the final implied estimate
of m to the interval [0, 1].
Given that each estimate of m is inferred from a set of two paired auctions, the value
p of the good under auction is defined as average revenue minus shipping costs across
the two auction conditions. The value τ of the opaque attribute is analogously defined
as the average shipping cost across the two auction conditions.
• For the study of DellaVigna and Pollet (2009) we take τ /p to be the ratio of the standard deviation of abnormal returns at earnings announcement to abnormal returns for
the quarter, pooled across all weekdays and computed following the methodology in
DellaVigna and Pollet (2009). The quarterly cadence is chosen to match the frequency

76

of earnings announcements in the authors’ sample. The return at earnings announcement is for two trading days from the close of the market on the trading day before the
earnings announcement to the close of the trading day after the earnings announcement. The standard deviation of the abnormal returns at earnings announcement is
0.0794. The standard deviation of the abnormal returns for the quarter, starting from
the close of the market on the trading day before the earnings announcement and continuing to the close of the market on trading day 60 after the announcement, is 0.2651.
The estimates for the attention parameter m are as in DellaVigna (2009).
• In the case of Lacetera, Pope, and Sydnor (2012), τ is taken to be the average mileage
remainder in the sample, which is approximately 5, 000, per correspondence with the
authors. The quantity p is obtained by subtracting τ = 5, 000 from the mileage of
the median car in the sample, which is 56, 997. Hence p = 51, 997. The estimate for
m is as reported by the authors in the full-sample specification that includes all car
transactions, pooled across fleet/lease and dealer categories.
• For the field experiment of Chetty, Looney, and Kroft (2009), we take τ /p to be the
relevant sales tax rate of 7.38%. Correspondingly, for the natural experiment of Chetty,
Looney, and Kroft (2009) we take τ /p to be 4.30%, which is the mean sales tax rate
for alcoholic products across U.S. states as reported by the authors. The estimates for
the attention parameter m are as reported by the authors.
• For the study of Taubinsky and Rees-Jones (2017), we analogously let τ /p be the sales
tax rate applied in the laboratory experiment, which is 7.31% in the standard-tax
treatment arm, and triple that value in the triple-tax treatment arm. The estimate for
the attention parameter m are as reported by the authors for the two treatment arms.
• Figure 1 additionally shows data points from Busse, Lacetera, Pope, Silva-Risso, and
Sydnor (2013b), who measure inattention to left-digit remainders in the mileage of used
cars in auctions along several covariate dimensions. Each data point corresponds to a
subsample of cars with mileages within a 10,000 mile-wide bin (e.g., between 15,000
and 25,000 miles, between 25,000 and 35,000 miles, and so forth). Data is available for
two data sets, one including retail auctions and one including wholesale auctions. For
each mileage bin, we include data points from both of these data sets. The estimates
of m are as reported by the authors. The metric τ /p is the average ratio of mileage
remainder to true mileage net of mileage remainder in the subsamples. As this ratio is
most readily available for the data set of wholesale car auctions, we compute the τ /p
estimates on subsamples of the wholesale data set only, under the assumption that the
mileage distribution is not systematically different across the two data sets. We do not
expect substantive impact on our results from this assumption.
