THE RESURGENCE OF INVENTORY RESEARCH:
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED?

ABSTRACT

Recent empirical and theoretical research on business inventories is
surveyed and criticaj.ly evaluated. While most inventory research has had
macroeconomic motivations, we focus on its microtheoretic basis and on
potential conflicts between theory and evidence.

The paper asks two principal questions. First, how can inventories,
which are allegedly used by firms to stabilize production, nonetheless be a

destabilizing factor at the macroeconomic level? Second, why, if firms are
following the production-smoothing model, is production more variable than

sales in many industries? We suggest that the so-called (S,s) model may help
answer both questions.

I. INTRODUCTION
After a long period of dormancy, research on inventories has undergone something of

a renaissance in recent years. Yet a student can still study undergraduate and graduate
economics for years in the best universities without hearing much about inventories in
macroeconomics and without ever hearing the subject mentioned in microeconornics.
This omission would not be cause for concern if inventories were a detail of minor

economic significance or little intrinsic interest. After all, economists do not dwell on the

fact that GNP is higher between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. than between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m.. But
simple observations suggest that inventory behavior is considerably more important than

that. At the macro level, we have known for a long time (but periodically forgotten) that
inventory movements are dominant features of business cycles. In a purely arithmetical
sense, Table I shows that the drop in inventory investment has accounted for 87% of the
drop in GNP during the average post war recession in the

I

At the micro level, we

know that firms vary a great deal in the levels and types of inventories they hold and
devote much time and effort to inventory management. It would be curious indeed if
inventory movements were details of such little importance that economists could safely

ignore them.

We think this most unlikely. In contrast, we suspect that a better understanding of
inventory behavior is essential to achieving a better understanding of both the
macroeconomics of business cydes and the microeconomics of the firm. In the following
pages, we endeavor to show why, to give some indication of what has been learned about

inventories over the last decade or so, and to set forth some of the important unanswered
questions for future research.

'If the extreme observations (1960 and 1980) are omitted, the average drops to 77%. The

The Intellectual Heritage
Though inventories were much discussed in the pre—Keynesian literature on

business cycles, as for example in Hawtrey (1928), modern interest in inventory behavior
derives from the work of Lundberg (1937) and Metzler (1941) who demonstrated that an
inventory—accelerator mechanism can produce cycles in simple Keynesian models.

Empirical and theoretical aspects of inventory behavior were hot topics from the early
1950s until the early 1960s. Abramovitz's (1950) seminal empirical work documented the
overwhelming importance of inventories in business cycles in the interwar period. A series
of papers in operations research beginning with Arrow, Harris, and Marschak (1951) and
ending with Scarf (1960) developed the mathematics of the (S,s) model of optimal

inventory holdings, which had been introduced decades before. Karlin (1958) and others
used stochastic dynamic programming techniques to analyze inventory behavior in models

with convex costs. A book by Holt, Modigliani, Muth, and Simon (1960), written as a
manual for plant managers, became instead an economic classic by introducing and
popularizing the linear—quadratic approach to optimization. Finally, Lovell's (1961)
empirical estimates of inventory stock—adjustment models became part of the Keynesian

econometric modeling tradition.
These developments in the world of ideas took place against the backdrop of
periodic business cycles that looked much like the inventory cycles Metzler had written

about a decade or two earlier. And no one seemed to notice the tension that was
developing between the macroeconomic and microeconomic views of inventories.

Macroeconomists, following Metzler, Abramovitz, and Lovell, thought of inventory

behavior as a destabilizing factor. In theory, the inventory accelerator created cycles that
otherwise might not exist; in practice, GNP was more volatile than final sales (GNP less

inventory investment). Yet the prevailing micro theory, following bIt et al, viewed

3

inventories as a stabilizing factor — a buffer stock that cost—minimizing firms could use to
smooth production in the face of fluctuating sales. Could something that was stabilizing at
the micro level actually destabilize the macroeconomy? It was a fascinating question that
was left unanswered.

Instead, and somewhat inexplicably, interest in inventories dried up in the 1960s.
Perhaps it was because scholars, failing to note the abovementioned micro—macro tension,

mistakenly concluded that the central intellectual problems were solved. More likely, the
long economic expansion of the 1960s reduced macroeconomic interest in inventory

movements, which are, after all, mainly important during recessions and around cyclical

turning points. Whatever the reason, there was precious little research on inventory
behavior by economists between about 1962 and about 1975.2

All this started to change after 1975 when economists came to the startling
realization that even a cyclical contraction as severe as that of 1973—1975 could be

predominantly an inventory cycle. At roughly the same time, Feldstein and Auerbach
(1976) called attention to some difficulties with the traditional stock—adjustment model.
Although these problems had been pointed out before,3 they were not widely known

outside a small group of inventory specialists; nor was it appreciated just howdevastating
they were. How, Feldstein and Auerbach asked, could firms take months or even years to
adjust to sales shocks when peak to trough movements in inventory levels in most

industries amounted to only a few days' production? It was a good question. A fewyears
later, Blinder (1981) and Blanchard (1983) deepened the mystery by showing that the
well—known fact that GNP is more variable than final sales carries over to industry—level

2Noteworthy exceptions include the theoretical work done by Zabel (1970,1972) and the
empirical applications of the linear—quadratic approach done by Childs (1967), Belsley
(1969) and Hay (1970).
3See, e.g., Carlson and Wehrs (1974) and Orr (1967).

4

data as well: In the vast majority of industries, production is more variable than sales. If
firms use inventories to smooth production, why is production more variable than sales?
Another good question.

By the early 1980s, then, economists knew once again something they had known in
the 1950s: that inventory investment was of first—order importance in business cycles. But

they were also beginning to suspect that both the standard theoretical model of inventory
behavior, the production smoothing/buffer stock model, and its empirical counterpart, the
stock adjustment model, were in deep trouble. This paper focuses on developments since

that realization.

II. FACTS TO BE EXPLAINED
If we are to know what questions to ask of inventory theory, it helps to begin with
the facts. At the end of 1989, U.S. businesses held over $1 trillion worth of inventories.
That is a sizable sum— over $4200 for every living American. Put somewhat differently,
the cost of holding all those inventories, even using a low 10% estimate for carrying costs,
exceeded the dividend payments made by all U.S. non—financial corporations.

Furthermore, contrary to popular belief, inventories are not leaner now than they were
decades ago. Despite the alleged revolution in inventory practices brought about by
computerization, Figure 1 shows that the economy—wide ratio of real inventories to real

sales has been trendless for 40 years. Inventory stocks amounted to 3.3 months' sales in
1949, 3.3 in 1959, 3.4 in 1969, 3.4 in 1979, and 3.1 in 1989.4

Who holds the inventories? At the end of 1989, over 87% of nonfarm inventories

A linear regression actually shows a trivial (and insignificant) upward trend. The
inventory—sales ratio in nominal terms, however, has declined, which is rather puzzling.

were held in the manufacturing and trade sectors of the economy.5 It is thus worth
examining closely the basic facts about manufacturing and trade inventories—.especiafly

since it was here that certain puzzling and provocative facts sparked the resurgence of
interest in inventories.
Table II reports some basic facts on manufacturing and trade inventories broken

down by sector and, within manufacturing, by stage of fabrication. The data are monthly,
seasonally adjusted, measured in 1982 dollars, and cover the period 1959:1 through 1986:10.6

Statistics are reported for manufacturing, wholesale trade, and retail trade. Within
manufacturing, inventories are broken down into finished goods, work in progress, and

materials and supplies. Wholesale and retail trade inventories are almost entirely finished
goods.

Table If—A reports means and variances for the inventory data.7 Focusing on the
five major components of inventory stocks— the three components of manufacturing

inventories plus the two trade components, we see that each accounts for (very) roughly a

5Farm inventories are about 7.5% of total inventories so that nonfarm inventories dominate

the total.

6See Hinrichs and Eckman (1981) for a description of the deflation procedure. The
inventory stocks were also adjusted to place inventory stocks and shipments in comparable
units. This is needed because inventories are valued at cost rather than market. See
Blinder and Holtz—Eakin (1983) and West (1983) for the appropriate adjustments.
TThe means are calculated with undetrended data. The variances and correlations are
calculated with data which were detrended as follows: The logarithmic level of each
variable was regressed on a constant, time, an OPEC variable, which is another time trend
that begins with the value one in 1973:10, and a measurement dummy that is one for all
values from 1967:1 onward. The OPEC variable was entered to see whether a change in
trend occurred after the first OPEC shock. The measurement dummy was induded to
adjust for data revisions which extended back only to 1967:1. Each regression was
estimated by a maximum likelihood procedure that allowed for a second—order process in
the error term. The detrended variable was constructed by subtracting the antilogarithm
of the fitted values of the above regression from the actual values of each variable. Both
the OPEC variable and the measurement dummy were generally very small and played
little role in the detrending procedure.

fifth of average inventory levels. Looking at inventory investment, however, a somewhat

different picture emerges. Two facts are striking. First, investment in manufacturers'
finished goods inventories is the smallest component of total inventory investment. For
example, in a typical month, retail inventories grew more than twice as much as
manufacturers' inventories of finished goods. More importantly, using the variance of
detrended inventory investment as a measure of volatility, finished goods inventories held

by manufacturers is the iI volatile component of total inventory investment. Despite
this lack of importance in business fluctuations, manufacturers' inventories of finished

goods have received the lion's share of attention in both theoretical and empirical work.
Most researchers seem to have barked up the wrong tree.

Second, retail inventories and materials and supplies held by manufacturers are by

far the two most volatile components of inventory investment. Indeed, these two together
play an exceedingly influential role in movements in total inventory investment. This is of
particular interest to theorists because the decisions of manufacturers to hold inventories of
materials and supplies and of retailers to hold inventories of finished goods are quite

similar. In each case, the key decision variable is deliveries— of materials and supplies in
one case and of finished goods in the other. If fixed costs are incurred in placing orders or

receiving deliveries, then models that stress "bunching" rather than "smoothing" of
deliveries can be applied fruitfully in both cases. Yet the literature concentrates on
inventory models based on production smoothing.
Table Il—B presents contemporaneous correlations among the various components of

detrended inventory investment. Again focusing on the five major components, the
correlations are surprisingly low, never exceeding .23. Each major component of inventory
investment seems to have a life of its own, which is discouraging from the viewpoint of
finding a single, unified theory to explain inventory investment.

7

Tables III and IV report on the variances and covariances of output, sales, and

inventory investment. In each case, the focus is on the identity:

Yt = Xt + ANt
where

is real output, X is real shipments, and ANt is real inventory investment. Two

measures of output, corresponding to two different measures of inventory investment, have

been widely used in the literature. Y1 adds investment in finished goods inventories to
shipments to obtain output; Y2 adds investment in work in progress inventories as well.8

Table Ill reports the facts for the major sectors of the economy that hold inventories.
Table IV presents the facts for two—digit industries in manufacturing.

Two findings stand out. First, the variance of production exceeds the variance of

shipments or sales in virtually all cases. This is true for the major sectcrs of theeconomy
that hold inventories and for almost all the two—digit manufacturing industries, no matter

how output is measured. Facts such as these cast doubt on the basic idea of theproduction
smoothing model, namely, that firms smooth output in the face of fluctuating sales.

An alternative explanation of this finding is that the Department of Commerce data
are inaccurate. Recently, Ghali (1987), Krane and Braun (1989), and Fair (1989) find that
production is less variable than sales in a few industries in which physical unit data are
available. Blanchard (1983), on the other hand, who also works with physical unit data,
finds that production varies more than sales in the automobile industry. These findings do

raise questions about the accuracy of the Commerce Department data, but so far the
contrary findings are for precious few industries and for limited sample periods and hence

8The appropriate definition of output is ambiguous in a multi—stage production process.
Most investigators have used Y1, which appears to be the natural definition. However, the
Commerce Department uses Y2 in constructing the price indexes it uses to deflate
inventory stocks. Hence the identity in the text holds only when N is defined to include
work in progress. See Blinder (1986b), p. 434n.

are not compelling as a general finding, especially when retail and wholesale trade as well

as manufacturing are considered.°
Second, sales and inventory investment are more frequently positively than

negatively correlated. This is true even with the most narrow definition of inventory
investment, namely, investment in finished goods inventories; and it raises questions about
whether inventories act as a buffer stock. A word of caution is in order here, however.
What is relevant in evaluating whether inventories serve as a buffer stock is the correlation
between the unanticiDated components of sales and inventory investment, not the total

levels. But empirical studies that have tried to investigate the correlation between
inventories and various measures of unanticipated sales have found relatively few negative
correlations. 10
Thus, we take the basic stylized facts to be explained as these:

(1) production tends to be more variable than sales in most industries;
(2) sales and inventory investment normally are

negatively correlated;

(3) the most volatile components of inventory investment are retail inventories and
manufacturers' inventories of raw materials and supplies.

III. MICROECONOMIC THEORIES OF INVENTORY BEHAVIOR
A microeconomic theory of inventory behavior begins by specifying a reason why

firms hold inventories. Many have been suggested. Inventories can be held for display
9For example, among the seven manufacturing industries studied by Fair, three are in
primary metals, which is the exceptional sector in Table IV, while production is more
variable than sales in two others. Hence only two small industries— cement and
(by some measures) tires— contradict the findings of Tables III and IV.
In related work, Miron and Zeldes (1987) show that two measures of output,
namely, sales plus the change in inventories, which is the measure we use, and the
industrial production index, have very different time series properties. A possible
(but not the only) explanation of this finding is that the inventory data are inaccurate.
t0See e.g., Blinder (1986a,b) and Haltiwanger and Maccini (1989).

9

purposes, as unavoidable "pipeline" inventories, to improve production scheduling, to
smooth production in the face of fluctuating sales, to minimize stockout costs, to speculate

on or hedge against price movements, to reduce purchasing costs by buying in quantity, to

shorten delivery lags, and so on. It is clear that no single model can hope to explain the
rich variety of inventory behavior; an explanation that is plausible for one industry or type
of inventory may be implausible for another.

Any abstract theory of inventory behavior must simplify and generalize. Probably,

that means focusing on just one motive for holding inventories. But which one? As we
have already observed, economists have singled out for attention the production

smoothing/buffer stock motive, which would seem to apply most naturally to
manufacturers' inventories of finished goods. The basic idea behind this model is simple
and intuitively appealing. If production cost functions are convex and sales vary over time,
a cost—minimizing strategy will smooth production relative to sales. Alternatively, an

explicit cost of changing production from period to period will have the same effect. If, in
addition, sales are stochastic, inventories will serve as a buffer stock as well.

Several of the facts enumerated in Section II suggest that the production

smoothing/buffer stock model may not be the best choice. First, manufacturers' finished
goods account for less than 13% of manufacturing and trade inventory investment.

Furthermore, they are the least volatile type of inventory investment, accounting for under
6% of the variance (see Table Il—A). Second, production seems to be more variable than
sales in most industries, which seems odd if firms are really trying to smooth production

(see Tables III and IV). Third, the aggregate ratio of inventories to sales shows no
downward trend (see Figure 1), which casts serious doubt on buffer stock theories of
inventory behavior since computerization should have reduced the need for inventories as
buffers.

10

Nonetheless, the production smoothing/buffer stock model has played the leading

role in both the theoretical and empirical literature. So, if we are to understand the
evolution of recent thought on inventories, we must begin our discussion there.

A. THE PRODUCTION SMOOTHING/BUFFER STOCK MODEL
1. THE BASIC MODEL
Production smoothing arises from variable demand and convex costs 11• A buffer

stock motive arises from stochastic demand. We start with the simplest possible model
that incorporates these essential ingredients, show why it fails to fit the facts, and then add
complications designed to bring theory and data into closer conformity.
To permit closed—form solutions, the demand function is specified as linear with a

stochastic intercept:

(1) xt=ö0_8Pt+,
and both production costs and inventory holding costs are assumed to be quadratic:

(2) C(yt) = c1y + (1/2c)y
(3) B(Nt) = bi(Nt — Kt) + {Nt — K)2
Here Kt is the level of inventories that minimizes inventory holding costs; we take Kt to be

zero at first. Notice that stochastic elements of cost are omitted at first; we bring them in
later.
The decision rules implied by maximizing the expected present discounted value of
profits depend on the nature of the demand shocks. 12 We allow for two kinds, corresponding

"Several authors, e.g., Blanchard (1983), add a cost of changing the level of production to
production costs. This creates an additional incentive for firms to smooth output over and
above the incentive inherent in rising marginal cost of production. Such costs, however,
are generally rationalized by appealing to costs of hiring and firing workers, etc.. These are
essentially costs of changing inputs, not output. We take up this subject later when we
discuss quasi—fixed factors of production.

l2The model is a slight adaptation of Blinder (1986b). Details on the solution can be found
there and in Blinder (1982).

to two possible meanings of the word "unanticipated":

(4)

=

+

The first shock, , is a surprise only to the econometrician, who has less information than
the firm; it is known to the firm before it must decide on this period's production and

prices. The second, , is truly unanticipated; it is unknown to the firm when it sets
and p. Hence, by definition, , cannot affect output and must come entirely out of
inventories. At first, we assume that both demand shocks are serially independent; later
we consider serial correlation.

With i.i.d. demand shocks, the solutions for production, sales, and inventory

investment take simple forms which bring out the central features of the production
smoothing model:

(5) t =y+/3A(N'_N) +flA€
(6)

Here

,

(7) Nt+i —Nt = A(N'_N) —(1 —A) —
, and N' are the nonstochastic steady—state solutions, and /3 and A are proper

fractions that depend on the parameters b, c, and 5 and on the real rate of interest.
The interpretation of these equations is straightforward. If the firm suddenly
acquires an additional unit of inventories, it will reduce production by /3A <
by (1 — A

1,

raise sales

< 1, and carry 1 — A of a unit as additional inventory into the next period.

The parameter A is thus naturally interpreted as the "speed of adjustment" to inventory
disequilibrium. Similarly, a unit rise in demand which the firm sees before making its

production plan () will be divided among higher output, higher
sales, and lower
inventories. These are the basic production smoothing results. Finally, a sales shock that

is truly unanticipated by the firm (e) must come entirely out of inventories. This is the
basic buffer stock result.

12

A glance at (5) — (7) shows heuristically why the simplest version of the production
smoothing model implies:

(8) var(y) < var(x)

(9) coy (x, N) <0.
Ignore the inventory terms on the righthand side of (5) — (7) and focus on the coefficients
of the shocks.'3 Both shocks contribute more to var(x) than to var(y) because 1—A(1—fl) >
4X; hence inequality (8) is implied. Inequality (9) holds because the coefficients of the

shocks have opposite signs in (6) and (7). The intuition is also clear. Inequality (8) just
says that flrm8 succeed in smoothing production. Inequality (9) says (approximately) that
positive sales shocks reduce inventories so that inventories perform a buffer stock role.

Finally, both the steady—state values of inventories and the speed of adjustment

depend on the real rate of interest. This observation serves as the basis for expecting a
negative response of inventory investment to changes in interest rates. But the functional
dependence of inventory investment on interest rates is complex.
2. EMPIRICAL ISSUES
Although the simple version of the production smoothing/buffer stock model
produces intuitively plausible predictions and rests on seemingly weak assumptions, it has

encountered empirical problems. To understand the nature of these problems, and to
discuss various ways to reconcile the theory with the facts, we take up three issues: the
degree to which production smoothing takes place; the performance of the
stock—adjustment model; and the response of inventory investment to interest rates.

a. Production Smoothing
The stylized facts of Section II already suggest that the simplest version of the
l3This is why the argument is only heuristic; a full solution must solve for Nt as a function of
lagged shocks. This involves quite a bit of algebra but does not change the conclusions

stated in the text.

13

production smoothing/buffer stock model is in trouble because the two key predictions of

the theory— inequalities (8) and (9)—are frequently 'violated in the data. Contrary to the
theory, production is often more variable than sales, and inventory investment and sales
are generally positively correlated.
Stylized facts, of course, do not constitute formal tests of any theory.

Unfortunately, the theory does not fare any better in formal tests. When West (1986)
generalized inequality (8) into a clever variance bounds test of the model, he found that
production is excessively volatile relative to sales under a variety of assumptions. Miron
and Zeldes (1988) showed that seasonal variation in production conforms closely to

seasonal variation in sales, so that inventories play little role in smoothing seasonal

fluctuations. This is an important result because firms might be expected to forecast
regular seasonal fluctuations rationally; hence the test can reasonably be viewed as a test of
the production—smoothing model rather than as a joint test of the model and rational

expectations. To minimize the need to impose strong restrictions about market structure
and industry demand, Eichenbaum (1989) tested the production—smoothing model using
only the necessary condition for cost minimization. He found that the over—identifying

restrictions implied by the model were overwhelmingly rejected. Furthermore, the key
buffer—stock prediction of the theory has also been rejected in recent econometric

investigations of inventory investment. The response of inventory investment to various
measures of unanticipated sales tends to be either positive, or, when it is negative, well
below unity in absolute value (see Blinder (1986a) and Haltiwanger and Maccini (1989)).

Clearly, the implications of the simplest version of the model do not accord with the facts.'4

On the other hand, Ghali (1987), Braun and Krane (1989), and Fair (1989) report results
supportive of production smoothing for a few selected industries.

14

These discrepancies between theory and fact ought to be of interest well beyond the
narrow confines of inventory theory, for the notion of production smoothing rests on convex
costs; and convex costs constitute one of the main pillars of neoclassical economic theory.

Without it, there is little reason to expect supply curves to be upward sloping. Can it be
that typical real—world cost functions are concave instead of convex? Blinder (1986b)

mentions this as one possible rationalization of the findings on inventory behavior. Ramey
(1988) has undertaken a formal test of the idea and offers evidence that marginal cost
functions are decreasing (in fact, steeply decreasing) rather than increasing for several
two—digit manufacturing industries. If this is true on a widespread basis, it would be easy

to understand why firms bunch rather than smooth production. But, at the same time, the
main foundation of the law of supply would crumble.

There are less radical explanations of the key facts (other than errors in the data).
One obvious candidate is cost shocks. Suppose (2) is modified to allow for an additive
shock to marginal cost:

(2') C(y) = (c1 + r)y + (1/2c)y,
where

is an i.i.d. cost shock. Suppose further that this cost shock is seen by firms before

they choose production. Then, in the absence of demand shocks, the solutions become:

(5') 't = S + N' — Nt) — c(1_f3))r
(6') x = — (1—fi)(N' — Nt) — c(l_13)Art
(7') Nt+i — Nt = A(N — Nt) — c(l—A)r'.
Clearly, cost shocks tend to make output more variable than sales and induce a positive

covariance between inventory change and sales. The intuition is clear. If a firm is faced
with cost shocks rather than demand shocks, inventories allow it to profit from

intertemporal substitution by raising production and building inventories when costs are
unusually low and cutting production and depleting inventories when costs are unusually

15

high.

Empirically, however, cost shocks seem to provide an incomplete explanation for the

disturbing facts. Some authors, e.g., Blinder (1986a) and Maccini and Rossana (1981,
1984), have found evidence that cost shocks in the form of raw material prices, but not

wage rates, affect inventory investment. Others have allowed for the possibility of various
types of cost shocks in direct tests of the production smoothing model. Miron and Zeldes
(1988) find no evidence that various measures of real input prices explain the behavior of

production. Eichenbaum (1989) does find evidence to support a model that includes an
unobserved, but serially correlated, technology shock. Thus, cost shocks seem to work only
when they are unobserved "technology shocks", not when they are observed factor prices. t5

This suggests that, while cost shocks may play some role in rationalizing the facts, they are
not plausible as a complete explanation. Something else is needed.
A simple and empirically appealing candidate is to allow demand shocks to be

serially correlated. If, for example,

is AR(1) with serial correlation parameter p, then

(5)—(7) become:

(5")

(6") x =—(1—fi)A(_N)+{1_(
(7") Nt+i — Nt = )((N' — Nt) — (1 — r)
where 0 =

< 1 and r is the real rate of interest. The only coefficients that change are
in each equation. Simple manipulations of these coefficients show that serial

correlation: (a) brings the coefficients of

in (5") and (6") closer together, which raises

the ratio var(y)/var(x) toward unity; and (b) makes it possible for the coefficients of

unobserved, serially correlated cost shocks dominate movements in aggregate GNP.

16

(6") and (7") to have the same sign, which could lead to a zero or positive covariance

between x and N.
The intuition behind these results is clear: more permanent demand shocks give
firms less reason to smooth production. Moreover, higher order stochastic processes for

in which sales are rationally anticipated to "build" before they decline, enhance prospects

that the relevant inequalities can be reversed. Blinder (1986b) shows that, in the presence
of highly serially correlated demand shocks, even rather small cost shocks are enough to

reverse both inequalities (8) and (9). However,

shocks continue to point toward the

empirically falsified inequalities (8) and (9). So, to bring the model's predictions into

greater conformity with the data, we also need an auxiliary assumption that most demand
shocks are known to firms before they commit themselves to production plans. We do not
know whether this is true.
In short, cost shocks combined with highly serially correlated demand shocks can

explain why the variance of production exceeds that of sales and why inventory investment
and sales are positively correlated. In this sense, the concept of convex production costs

can be saved. But, empirically, it is not clear that this is a convincing explanation.
b. Stock Adjustment Models
Since Lovell (1961), the following stock—adjustment model has been widely used

empirical work on inventory investment:
(10)

Nt÷i_ Nt = w1(N

—

Nt)

—

1r2(xt

—

Et(xt))

O<r1(1 0<v21
where
(11)

Nt = o + ?7iEt(xt) + 2E(r) +

The first term in (10) is planned or anticiDated inventory investment, which is proportional

to the gap between the "desired" and actual stocks of inventories. Here

is the

17

"adjustment speed" and N is the desired stock, which is typically related to current

expected sales, E(xt), current cpected costs, E(r), such as wage rates, raw material
prices, and energy prices, and current expected real interest rates, Et(rt). The second term
in (10) is unanticiDated inventory investment, which captures the extent to which
inventories buffer sales surprises. The closer is

to unity, the greater the degree to which

inventories buffer demand shocks.

The theory we have just outlined can rationalize something close to this empirical

model. Assume that the firm minimizes expected discounted costs, including both
production and inventory holding costs as specified in (2) and (3) above, and faces

exogenous sales and cost shocks. Then the inventory investment relationship that emerges
from the model is:
(12)

N1 — N = (N: — Nt) —

where A depends on

b,c and r. Further

(13) N: = ()) [—(1_A)Et(x) +
+ c..\ E (Ø(1—A))'E(r+.) + N]
i=1
where 0 < A < 1, and

is the discount factor,16 If sales are endogenous and the firm

maximizes expected discounted profits, then inventory investment can again be written as

(12) with the adjustment parameter, A, now depending on 5 as well and with

replacing Et(xt+). Note that e, the demand shock that is known to the firm when it
makes price and output decisions, may be interpreted as a shift variable which enters the
firm's demand curve, e.g., real income.
Clearly, the production smoothing/buffer stock model does rationalize certain key

'6The inventory investment equation and the specification of the desired stocksare derived
by solving the second— order difference equation for inventories that emerges from the
optimality conditions.

18

features of the stock adjustment model. For one, the speed of adjustment is less than unity.

Further, it is easy to show that the adjustment speed is slower the greater is the incentive

to smooth production, i.e., the smaller is c in (2). For another, when output and price are
set before demand is known, so that inventories alone buffer demand shocks, the model

predicts that r2 = 1.
Some substantive differences between the theoretical and the empirical models arise

with the specification of the desired stock. One is that expected

is almost always used

as the relevant expected demand variable in empirical work, even when the theory is based
on profit maximization, in which case sales are endogenous.

A second is that the desired stock should depend on future as well as current

expected sales and costs. This distinction is important because current and future expected

sales have opposite signs in (13). An increase in Et(xt) reduces N but an increase in

Et(xt+1) raises N for all i >

0.

Hence, if Et(xt) and E(r) alone are included in emprical

models, they must be regarded as capturing the net effects, which will be reasonable only if
current and future expected sales and costs are highly correlated.

How has the stock adjustment model performed empirically? Not very well. A
major difficulty is that estimated adjustment speeds are extremely low, often less than 10%
per month. This is implausible, especially when, as pointed out by Feldstein and Auerbach
(1976), even the widest swings in inventory stocks amount to no more than a few days of
production.

A natural reaction to this state of affairs is to argue that the estimates of the
adjustment speed must suffer from econometric biases. One obvious potential source of

such bias is omitted variables. Until recently, most studies of inventory investment omitted
cost variables. If such variables are correlated with inventories, then ir1 may be biased
downward. Some influence of real raw material prices, but not real wage rates, has in fact

19

been found. But substantially higher adjustment speeds have not been achieved. IT
Another potential source of a bias is the estimation procedure. In a model with a

lagged dependent variable and a serially correlated error term, an inapproriate estimation
procedure may give rise to adjustment speeds that are biased downwards. Maccini and
Rossana (1984) argued that previous studies of inventory investment had failed to correct
properly for serial correlation. Using Ratanaka's two—etep procedure, they found very fast

adjustment speeds coupled with high serial correlation in the error terms. Blinder (1986a),

however, countered that the Hatanaka method tends to settle on a local rather than a
global minimum of the sum of squared errors and that the global minimum normally has
slow adjustment and low serial correlation. Subsequently, work by Hall and Rossana
(1989) suggests that the difference in results may have more to do with differences in model

specification than with differences in estimation methods. In any case, an appropriate
adjustment for serial correlation seems not to resolve the problem.
Still another possibility is aggregation bias—either over time or over firms.
Christiano and Eichenbaum (1987) observed that, if firms make decisions at intervals

shorter than the interval over which the data are sampled, then empirical work may turn

up estimates of adjustment speeds that are too low. Using estimation procedures that take
time aggregation into account, they have had some limited success in producing more

plausible adjustment speeds. Seitz (1988), using survey data for individual firms in
Germany, found that aggregation over firms led to substantially slower estimated
adjustment speeds.lS These are promising avenues that need to be explored further.

Unless aggregation biases prove to be very important, it is difficult to attribute the

'TSee Maccini and Rossana (1981, 1984), Blinder (1986a), and Irvine (1988) for empirical
investigations of this question.

U.S. data.

20

low adjustment speeds to statistical biases. Yet theory strains to explain slow adju8tment,
requiring steep marginal cost or marginal revenue schedules or a flat marginal inventory

holding cost schedule to do it. But the first of these implies a strong incentive to smooth
production, which does not seem to be present. In short, the puzzle remains.

Another troubling feature of empirical work with stock adjustment models is that
estimates of ir2, which measures the degree to which inventories serve as a buffer stock, are

frequently quite low, generally statistically insignificant, and sometimes even of the wrong

sign. This suggests that finished goods inventories play little role as a buffer for demand
shocks. Blinder (1986b) suggests that the low values of r2 may mean that the bulk of
demand shocks are known to firms when they make decisions but are treated as unexpected

by the econometrician. This, however, is a difficult point to establish empirically.

Finally, consider estimates of the determinants of desired stocks. The estimates of

the parameter, i, which captures the response of inventories to changes in expected
demand, tend to be very small, bouncing from positive to negative values in sign. This

may be due to the fact that the variable that is used as a measure of expected demand is a
blend of current and future expected sales which have opposite effects on inventories (see

equation (13)), producing on net small coefficients with little systematic influence on
inventories.

c. Inventory Investment and Interest Rates
The financial press and statements by business people are replete with assertions

that higher interest rates induce firms to cut inventory holdings. Although it is often not
clear whether real or nominal interest rates are being referred to, there is perceived to be

an inverse relationship between interest rates and inventory investment. Consistent with
this, intertemporal price speculation is the first idea that pops into the minds of many
economists when they think about inventory behavior. The central idea is absolutely

21

— so simple, in fact, that it is hard (for economists, anyway) to imagine how it

simple

could be wrong.

Consider a firm that owns a storable commodity worth Pt today. It expects each

unit to be worth Ept÷i next period. Suppose the commodity depreciates at the
nonstochastic rate s and can be carried forward for one period at a cost of h per unit
(Incurred at the start of the period). If the firm is risk—neutral and can borrow or lend
freely at nominal interest rate i, its intertemporal choice is simple. A unit can be sold

today for t or carried forward for one period to net the firm:

implies that the firm's demand for inventories should be infinitely elastic with

respect to the real rate of interest. Yet little influence of real interest rates on inventory
investment can be found empirically.

It is easy to escape the unhappy conclusion that the interest elasticity should be

infinite. Just (a) make the marginal storage cost, h, a rising function of the amount stored,
N, as in the production smoothing model; or (b) introduce imperfect competition, i.e., a
downward—sloping demand curve for the firm, as in equation (1) above; or (c) introduce

risk aversion by maximizing utility rather than wealth, which would amend (14) by
attaching marginal utility weights to the prices. None of these modifications, however,

laIf firms behave this way, competitive equilibrium obviously enforces the arbitrage

22

disturbs the basic conclusion that the interest sensitivity of inventory investment is
negative— which seems to be an inescapable feature of any intertemporal optimization
model of inventories.

To test for this sensitivity empirically in the linear—quadratic version of the theory,

however, is difficult because the real interest rate enters the solution for inventories in a
highly nonlinear fashion—in the discount rate for expected future sales or costs, and as a

determinant of both the adjustment speed and the steady state value of inventories (see

(12) and (13) above). One approach that has been used to deal with this problem is to

assume the real interest rate takes on a particular known value to facilitate the
identification of other parameters and to ease estimation.20 This eliminates by assumption

any influence of interest rates on inventory investment and thus throws out a potentially
important channel through which monetary policy may operate.
An alternative is to work with a specification of desired stocks, as in (11), which

includes expected real interest rates as a determinant of

and thus of inventory

investment. This crude but workable approximation to the role the real interest rate plays
in the theory has been pursued by numerous investigators. Unfortunately, it generally fails
to uncover an effect of real interest rates on inventory investment, especially that of
finished goods in manufacturing.2t

Why? Perhaps including expected real interest rates as a determinant of desired
stocks is simply too crude an approximation to the theoretically correct influence. If so,

20See, e.g., Blanchard (1983) or Eichenbaum (1984). Years ago, economists argued that real
interest rates were in fact constant. The experience of the late seventies and early eighties,
however, appears to have shattered this argument.
21See Akhtar (1983) for references to the literature through the early eighties. The only
recent work that finds an effect of interest rates on finished goods inventory investment is
Ramey (1989) who treats finished goods inventories as a factor of production, which seems
doubtful on theoretical grounds, and finds only weak evidence in a few two—digit
industries.

23

the theory with a varying discount factor may need to be carried all the way through to the
estimation stage. Or perhaps empirical measures of real rates fail to capture the effects of
tighter or looser credit conditions faced by firms when borrowing to finance the holding of

inventories.22 Or, finally, the nominal rate and the expected rate of inflation may enter the
relevant estimating equation separately due to tax considerations, the prevalence of FIFO
pricing practices, etc.23 Whatever the reason, the question of why inventory investment
seems to be insensitive to changes in real interest rates remains open and important.
3. SOME ADDITIONAL RESCUE ATTEMPTS
Over the years, the basic production smoothing/buffer stock model has been

extended in a number of directions at least in part to resolve the empirical puzzles
mentioned above. We now explore the key features and implications of several of these
extensions: quasi—fixed factors of production, stockouts, labor contracts, and strategic
behavior.
a. Quasi—Fixed Factors of Production

Several authors have introduced quasi—fixed factors of production into inventory

models.24 Factors are quasi—fixed when there are (strictly convex) adjustment costs to
changing them. Some examples are employment when there are costs of hiring and firing
workers, and materials and supplies or intermediate goods inventories when there are costs
of acquiring or disposing of such goods more quickly. Such costs give decisions on the

relevant factor inputs a crucial intertemporal aspect, creating an interaction between

22See Greenwald and Stiglitz (1988) for an analysis of the effects of imperfect information
and associated finance constraints on production and, potentially, inventory decisions of
firms.

23See Blinder (1981) and Irvine (1981a) for discussion of this point.
24See, e.g., Eichenbaum (1983), and Maccini (1984) for theoretical work and, e.g.,
Eichenbauin (1984), Maccini and Rossana (1984), Rossana (1990), and Topel (1982) for
empincal work.

24

"investment" in these factors and in finished goods inventories. The empirical implication
of this interaction is that the basic stock—adjustment equation, (10), must be modified to:

(15)

Nt+l_ Nt =

— Nt) —

r2(xt

—

E(x)) +

—

M)

where Mt and M are the actual and "desired" stocks of the quasi—fixed factor and < 0.25
The reason for the negative sign for

is the following: if the firm finds itself with an

excess stock of the quasi—fixed factor, then the adjustment costs induce the firm to

eliminate the excess stock gradually by producing more output and thus adding to its stock
of finished goods inventories. The prime motivation for including quasi—fixed factors into

inventory investment equations was the conjecture that the low estimated adjustment
speeds might be due to statistical biases arising from their omission.
Unfortunately, while some evidence exists for the interaction between finished goods

inventories and certain quasi—fixed factors (significant estimates of 3) including actual
stocks of quasi—fixed factors in empirical inventory investment equations has had little
effect on the size of adjustment speeds (estimates of ir1).26 Furthermore, adjustment costs

attached to quasi—fixed factors tend to smooth fluctuations in these factors and thus to

reduce the variability of output. This clearly does not help to bring the model into closer
conformity with the fact that production tends to be more variable than sales.

b. Stockouts
One extension of the basic model that

help to resolve the empirical puzzles is

25A similar effect arises from including costs of changing output in the firm's cost structure,
as indicated above. Such costs render output a state variable and result in a similar
modification of the basic stock adjustment equation, with lagged y replacing M in (15).
Costs of changing output, however, are usually rationalized on the basis of adjustment
costs of changing factors of production. Such costs are costs of changing inputs, not
output, and thus we have focused our discussion on quasi—fixed factors of production.
26See, e.g., Maccini and Rossana (1984), and Blinder (1986a).

25

to allow for the possibility that the firm may be caught out of stock when an order arrives
and thereby suffer a loss in 8aleS. Stockouts were incorporated in a rough—and—ready way

into the original linear—quadratic model of Holt et. al., by thinking of inventory—holding

costs as the sum of two components. One is the cost of carrying inventories, which rises

monotonically with inventories. The other is the expected cost of stocking out which, for
any given level of expected sales, falls with inventories. Define Kt as the value of

inventories that minimizes the sum of these two costs. Up to now, we have assumed that

Kt is zero. Suppose, instead, that Kt is proportional to sales: Kt =

Now an increase

in sales raises desired inventory accumulation because it raises Kt. This tends to increase
the variability of output relative to sales and also to impart a positive covariance to
inventories and sales.

As several authors (e.g., Kahn (1987)) have pointed out, however, the treatment of

stockouts in the linear-quadratic model suffers from two deficiencies. One is that negative

inventories are permitted. Any orders that the firm cannot serve are assumed to be
backlogged and result in sales and revenue in the period in which they occur, which seems

to contradict the very notion of stockouts and the associated lost sales. The other

deficiency is that the specification of the determinants of the target stock, Kt, is h.
A rigorous treatment of stockouts requires that the model incorporate the idea that
a firm loses sales if it is caught out of stock when demand is high.2? To do this, we must
distinguish between demand,

and sales, x. With stockouts, sales are:

xt = min(q, Nt +
where Nt + t is the amount of goods available for sale in period t. If > +
stockouts occur, and the unsatisfied demand is assumed to be lost forever.
2TZabel (1972, 1988) in particular has drawn out the implications of the so—called lost sales
model. See also Abel (1985), Haltiwanger and Maccini (1988a, 1988b) and Kahn (1987) for
recent work.

26

A little analysis shows that expected sales are the difference between expected

demand and expected stockouts. Hence, in contrast with the linear—quadratic model,
stockouts affect revenue, not co8ts, and are more complex in that expected stockouts

depend on production as well as sales. Nevertheless, it remains true that higher initial
inventories, Nt, reduce expected stockouts and thus raise expected revenue—which
corresponds to the downward—sloping component of the firm's inventory holding cost

function in the 4 linear—quadratic approach.
Stockouts alone seem to do little to explain the troubling facts. Imposing a
non—negativity constraint on inventories and allowing for lost sales in a model with i.i.d.
demand shocks does not raise the variance of production above that of sales (See Zabel

(1988) or Kahn (1987)). Further, stockouts provide little help in explaining the low
adjustment speeds or the interest insensitivity of inventory investment.
Recently, however, Kahn (1987) has modified the standard lost sales model to help

explain the puzzling variance inequality. The idea is that a firm that stocks out in one
period backlogs some of the excess demand, and the backlogged orders become a

component of demand in the next period. Specifically, total demand in a period,

is now "new" demand, and a[q1_ (Nt_i+ —)J is the portion of last period's

excess demand which was backlogged. Kahn shows that under these circumstances the
variance of production can exceed the variance of sales.28 Essentially, the reason is that
sales are smoothed because the ability to backlog demand enables the firm to shift sales
away from periods when demand is high, and current production is made more volatile

28Kalm (1987) also shows that a rigorous treatment of stockouts together with serial
correlation in demand, which we considered above, will do the trick. Alternatively,
stockouts combined with small cost shocks may be enough to explain the pertinent facts.
For empirical evidence on the stockout motive, see Kahn (1988).

27

because it responds to the backlogged excess demand of previous periods.29

c. Labor Contracts
Another extension that helps to explain the facts is implicit labor contracts, which
were originally developed by Azariadis (1975), Baily (1974), and others.3° Multiperiod

labor contracts attach a labor force to the firm. If firms face significant hiring and firing
costs and workers face search and mobility costs, the attached labor force will exhibit quite

a bit of inertia. But, firms can vary the utilization of the attached labor force, and thus
employment, through temporary layoffs and recalls that absorb unanticipated demand
shocks. In effect, the firm now has both a stock of inventories and a stock of workers which
can be used to "buffer" demand shocks.

This theoretical innovation helps explain the stylized facts in two ways. First, if the
firm's cost structure dictates reliance on temporary layoffs and recalls rather than
inventories to buffer demand shocks, then employment and production may be more

variable relative to sales.3' As long as costs are convex, this factor by itself will never raise

the variance of production above that of sales. But small cost shocks may be enough to
accomplish that.
Second, temporary layoffs can explain why finished goods inventories appear not to

be used as buffer stocks. If labor contracts make temporary layoffs and recalls a relatively

low cost alternative to firms, then adjustments in the labor force, not inventories, may do
most of the buffering of demand shocks. Hence, r2 in (10) may be quite small. Some

29West (1988b) offers evidence for seven production—to—order industries that shipments are

in fact strongly smoothed relative to new orders but that production is not smoothed
relative to shipments.

30See Topel (1982) and Haltiwanger and Maccini (1988a, 1988b) for studies that incorporate
labor contracts into inventory models.
3'This is unlike models that attach adjustment costs to employment rather than to the
attached labor force.

28

evidence in support of this position 18 presented in Haltiwanger and Maccini (1988c, 1989).

d. Strategic Behavior
With the surge in recent years in the application of game theory to economic

problems, it is not surprising that strategic ideas have been used to try to understand the
puzzling behavior of inventories. In particular, Rotemberg and Saloner (1989) develop a
model of a duopoly in which inventories act as a strategic variable which deters each firm

from deviating from an implicit collusive arrangement. They show that under certain
conditions each firm holds inventories to serve as an "arsenal" to use to "punish" its rival if
it deviates from the sustainable, symmetric equilibrium. High inventories play this role by
signalling that, if the rival deviates from the cooperative equilibrium, the firm will be able

to respond with a large increase in sales. This makes collusion more attractive to a

potential deviator.
While the model is special in many respects, it does suggest that thinking of
inventories as a strategic variable may help to unravel some of the empirical puzzles. In
particular, Rotemberg and Saloner show that, under certain conditions, the model can
explain the empirical finding that inventory investment and sales are positively correlated.

In their model, an upward shift in industry demand raises both equilibrium sales and the
incentive for a firm to deviate from the equilibrium. To counter this threat, each duopolist
may raise its inventory holdings to increase its capability to punish its rival. Hence,
inventories rise with sales.

Inventories are more apt to be used for strategic reasons in industries that are
susceptible to collusive arrangements. Consistent with this implication, Rotemberg and
Saloner provide some empirical evidence that the positive association between inventories

and sales is stronger in more concentrated industries.

29

4. TAKING STOCK
An enormous amount of research has used variants of the production
smoothing/buffer stock model to analyze the holding of finished goods inventories by

manufacturers. The theory rests on seemingly weak assumptions but has encountered
rough seas in empirical work. It has difficulty explaining why production is more variable
than sales in many industries and why inventory investment and sales are positively
correlated—though the feat can be achieved with some combination of cost shocks, serial

correlation in demand, stockouts, labor contracts, or strategic considerations. The theory's
empirical performance in its stock—adjustment form has been distinctly disappointing,
producing implausibly low adjustment speeds and a lack of sensitivity of inventory

investment to changes in interest rates.
A serious question must be raised at this stage of research: Is it productive to devote
so many resources to the application of the production smoothing/ buffer stock model to
the analysis of manufacturers' inventories of finished goods? We indicated in Section II

that manufacturer's inventories of finished goods are the least volatile component of

inventory investment. Much of the research is thus applying a model that does not fit the

data terribly well, no matter how much it is manipulated, to an area—manufacturers'
inventories of finished goods— that is relatively unimportant. If we are to achieve a better
understanding of movements in aggregate inventory investment, it seems wise to pay more

attention to other components of inventories, in particular, to retail inventories and to
manufacturers' inventories of non—finished goods and materials and supplies. To do this,

models other than the production smoothing/buffer stock model probably will need to be

considered. The most prominent alternative is the (S,s) model.
B. THE (S.s) MODEL OF INVENTORY BEHAVIOR
If short—run marginal costs are increasing, inventories should be used to smooth

30

production. However, this is not necessarily the only, nor even the most natural,
technological assumption in all, nor even in most, applications. Recall, for example, the
finding in Section II that manufacturers' inventories of finished goods and work in progress

account for just 22% of the variance of monthly inventory investment; the remaining 78%
comes from retail and wholesale inventories and from manufacturers' holdings of materials

and supplies.32 The productive activities in this last group consist basically of moving

goods, not making them. Here the presumption that production is subject to rising
marginal costs simply has no persuasive rationale.
When a manufacturer acquires raw materials and supplies for subsequent use, goods

are transported from one factory or warehouse to another. When wholesalers and retailers
purchase goods from manufacturers, products are taken off one shelf, transformed in some

way (perhaps as little as moving and unpacking), and put on another shelf. Who really
believes that such transport activities are subject to rising marginal costs, e.g., that the
first dozen shirts a department store orders from a manufacturer cost less than the 15th
dozen? In fact, the opposite presumption is more plausible in most cases: Beyond the
fixed costs of handling an order, marginal costs are probably either constant or declining.
The technological assumption that acquisition costs consist of a fixed cost plus a
constant marginal cost leads to the so—called (S,s) model of inventory behavior. Under this
strategy, the firm optimally picks some number, s, below which it will not let its

inventories fall. Whenever stocks reach this lower trigger point, it places an order large
enough to restore inventories to some upper limit, S, also selected optimally.33 The
quantity S — s is called the optimal lot size and depends on such variables as the fixed cost,

32The 22%—78% split ignores all covariance terms. For a full accounting, see Table Il—A.

If time is discrete rather than continuous, or if there are delivery lags, inventories might
fall below s and the purchase needed to restore inventories to S might therefore differ from
S—s.

31

the purchase price, the probability distribution of sales, and the rate of interest.34 If these
variables change through time, then the optimal policy is an (St,s) rule with time—varying
trigger points.
The economic behavior implied by the (S,s) model differs greatly from that of the

production smoothing model, at least at the level of the individual firm. For example, a
firm following an (S,s) strategy has neither an "optimal level" of inventory nor a "speed of

adjustment." Instead, it has an optimal range. Whenever its lower trigger point is hit, it
adjusts immediately; otherwise, it does not adjust at all.

The (S,s) idea is an old one, dating back at least to Harris (1915). Modern interest
in (S,s) was sparked by the pioneering paper of Arrow, Harris, and Marschak (1951), which
was followed by a series of papers culminating in Scarf's (1960) demonstration that (S,s)
behavior is optimal under quite general conditions as long as the cost of acquiring goods is
precisely:

(16)

C(y) = A + cy

=0

if y >

0

ify=0,

where y is the purchase quantity and A and c are positive constants.35

Introspection suggests that the cost function (16) is much more relevant to the
activities of wholesalers, retailers, and manufacturers holding raw materials than the
convex cost functions we associate with manufacturing processes. More important, the
(S,s) or two—bin strategy seems to be widely used in industry. We know this from

anecdotal evidence (e.g., we see it practiced in stores) and from the fact that reference

34Closed—form solutions for s and S are generally hard to come by. See Hadley and Whitin
(1963) for examples.
35Bar—Ilan (1985) established that (S,s) behavior is optimal with even more general cost
functions if time is continuous. The key ingredient is the presence of fixed costs.

32

books for purchasing agents and retail management texts concentrate on (S,s) strategies. 36
Despite this, the standard stock—adjustment model has been the organizing

framework for most of the empirical work that has been done on retail inventories,
wholesale inventories, and manufacturers' inventories of materials and supplies.37 Not

surprisingly, this research has run into the usual litany of difficulties: implausibly low
adjustment speeds, insignificant effects of unanticipated sales, etc..

Table Ill shows that the puzzling inequality var(y)> var(x) holds even more
strongly in trade than it does in manufacturing, and that cov(x,iN) is small but positive
in retailing and wholesaling. It is easy to understand why the (S,s) model feels at home

with the stylized facts that pose such difficulties for the production smoothing model. In

the inventory identity:

y=x+tN,
y now denotes deliveries and x denotes usage for manufacturers' raw materials or sales for

retailers and wholesalers. In an (S,s) model, a large realization of x will automatically

make cov(x,iN) <0 for any firm that does

hit its lower trigger point. Firms that hit

their lower s barriers, however, will replenish inventories, thereby making cov(x4N)

positive for them. So we should not be surprised to find cov(x4N) n 0 in the aggregate. If
that is so, then var(y) must necessarily exceed var(x). It is precisely this reasoning that
first led Blinder (1981) to offer (S,s) as an explanation of the stylized facts for retailers.
The critical problem with applying the (S,s) model to the data economists generally

have — which are aggregated over time, products, and firms — is that the model does not
lend itself easily to aggregation. Because firms react to the same sales shock differently
depending on where they are in their (S,s) range, the market does not behave like a blowup

36See Mosser (1986, p. 52, fn.1) for a summary of the business literature.
3TSee, for example, Irvine (1981a,b) and Ramey (1989).

33

of any representative firm. For example, consider a retailer with S = 10 and s = 2 and
sales of five units this period. If it starts the period with inventories of 7 or less, it will
place an order for S — s = 8 new units this period. But if it starts with more than 7 units

in stock, it will order nothing. Thus it is clear that the total volume of orders resulting
from any given level of aggregate sales depends on the distribution of initial inventories

across firms. If the initial distribution of inventories is skewed toward s, orders will react

strongly. If, on the other hand, it is skewed toward S, the reaction will be muted.
For a long time, the seeming impossibility of aggregating the (S,s) model was

thought to be an insuperable barrier to confronting it with data. But first Blinder (1981)
and then Caplin (1985) showed — in two quite different ways — that the barrier could be
overcome. Both authors deal with single—product firms with identical values of S and s —
analogous to the usual assumption that all firms have the same cost function. Firms differ

in that they have different opening inventory stocks and get different realizations of sales.
Caplin's (1985) approach begins by observing that an (S,s) policy makes inventories

a Markov process: Only the opening inventory stock and this period's sales affect the

closing inventory stock. The stationary distribution of this stochastic process is the
uniform distribution in which all inventory levels between s and S are equally likely, just as
common sense suggests. The mean of this steady—state distribution, (S+s)/2, is obviously

constant over time. Less obviously, Caplin shows that the expected value of N conditional
on sales is equal to the same unconditional mean, and is therefore itself constant. Thus:

E(LN) = E(y — x)

0,

from which it follows that:
(17)

y—x=e,

where e is an error term with zero mean. From (17), it follows trivially that var(y) >
var(x) and cov(iN,x) = cov(e,x)

= 0. These are roughly the two puzzling stylized facts of

34

Section II.

Caplin's results are surely elegant and insightful. But they seem to be of limited
practical use because they pertain only to the (unconditional) stationary distribution of
inventories. Somewhat surprisingly, Mosser (1987, 1988) nonetheless offers empirical

evidence that supports the model for both retailers and wholesalers. Her most direct test is

of the proposition that x and N should have zero covariance, which she can reject in only
one of nine retail sectors and five of eighteen wholesale sectors. So perhaps Caplin'8 results

have more empirical applicability than it seems at first glance.
Blinder's (1981) approach, by contrast, requires no steady—state assumption; but it

does embody a crucial linear approximation. He begins by writing the (S,s) rule as a rule
for orders:

y=S—s

=0

ifN—xs
ifN—x>s,

where N is initial inventory, x is sales, and y is orders. Taking the expectation of y over
the density of Q

N — x gives the market—wide expected value of orders:
S

= I (S—s)ft(Qt)dQt =
(S_s)Ft(s)
s—x*

(18)

where x is the largest possible value of x.38 Equation (18) displays the aggregation
problem clearly: The average level of orders depends not just on the average levels of sales
and opening inventories, but also on their distributions.
Blinder makes (18) empirical by linearization. For example, consider some

parameter z that changes S while affecting neither s nor the initial distribution function

F(Q). By direct differentiation of (18):
(19)

.

=

Ft(s).

38Blinder (1981) actually assumes discrete rather than continuous time, and hence obtains
slightly different formulas. The continuous—time case, used here, is simpler.

35

In principle, derivatives like this depend on the shape of the distribution function Ft(Q)

and hence should vary over time. Blinder ignores this time dependence and treats them
instead as regression coefficients to be estimated. This seems neither more nor less

objectionable than linearizations that are routinely done in other contexts.
It is sometimes argued that the (S,s) model, once aggregated, yields behavior

identical to the stock adjustment model. This is not true, even though Blinder (1981, p.
475) shows that an aggregated (S,s) model can be manipulated to yield an equation which
relates average inventory investment to average sales and average initial inventories.
Specifically:

Nt+i — Nt = aiEt(xt) + a(Xt — Et(x)) + aNt + error term
where the c parameters are combinations of derivatives like (19) that depend, among
other things, on the initial density function of Q = N — x. This certainly resembles a
stock—adjustment equation; compare it with (10) above with N a function of expected
sales. However, the coefficient of opening inventories (a3) has nothing to do with the
"speed of adjustment" and might even exceed unity; and the error term is complicated and
correlated with Nt.
In addition, the model's dynamics differ dramatically from those of the stock
adjustment model. As Blinder (1981) illustrates in a numerical example, following any
temporary sales shock, an economy consisting of many firms following (S,s) policies will

ultimately settle down into a steady state with a uniform distribution of stocks across

firms, just as Caplin's result dictates. But, the adjustment process may take a long time
and, in the interim, inventory stocks and flows will follow complex paths that echo past

events in ways that bear little resemblance to the stock adjustment model.
Can we cope with such complexity empirically and test the model rigorously? The
estimation of (S,s) models has barely begun; and there may be better aggregation

36

techniques than either Blinder or Caplin has thought of — methods, for example, that deal
with the time—varying nature of S and s. So we are a long way from knowing the answer

to this question. It would be premature to declare now that the (S,s) model is the solution
to the micro/macro paradox mentioned at the start of this essay. But we do know a few
things. First, the (S,s) model can be derived from optimizing behavior under plausible
conditions. Second, (S,s)—type strategies are apparently in wide use in industry. And

third, the (S,s) model is consistent with the stylized facts of inventory behavior, at least in

a broad sense. All this seems to constitute a good start

IV. THE MACROECONOMICS OF INVENTORIES
The discussion up to now has been almost entirely microeconomic. Yet the reader
may have noticed that most of the authors whose work has been cited probably consider

themselves macroeconomists. This curious state of affairs stems from data like those in
Table I, which shows the dominant role of inventory investment in postwar U.S. recessions.

Such data have apparently captured the attention of (at least some) macroeconomists while
being ignored by microeconomists.

There is nothing unusual about the data in Table I. Abramovitz (1950) observed
some 40 years ago that precipitous declines in inventory investment were a major feature of
U.S. recessions in the period between the two world wars. Wilkinson (1989) found that
inventory movements have played an even larger role in cyclical fluctuations in most other

members of the Group of Seven than in the U.S. Furthermore, West (1988a) has pointed

out that aggregate output seems to be more volatile than final sales in most of these
countries.

Such empirical evidence suggests that inventories play a major role in the

37

propagation of recessions.39 Yet inventories are assigned a bit part, at best, in most
economic theories of the business cycle. They are either tacked on as an afterthought or,
more typically, omitted entirely. In our view, the neglect of inventories is a serious
omission—not just for the sake of descriptive realism, but because inventories have

important implications for the behavior of a wide variety of macro models. In fact, adding
inventories to a macro model often changes its implications substantially, as we now show.

A. INVENTORIES IN KEYNESIAN MODELS
Early in the post—Keynesian era, Erik Lundberg (1937) and Lloyd Metzler (1941)

realized that deviations of actual from expected sales would push inventory stocks out of

equilibrium and that firms' subsequent efforts to restore inventory equilibrium could lead
to cyclical behavior. Metzler constructed a series of formal models in which inventory
dynamics provide a natural explanation for business cycles but can, for certain parameter

values, lead to dynamic instability.
Since the details of Metzler's original model look quaintly idiosyncratic to the
modern eye, we begin our investigation of the macroeconomics of inventories with a

modernized version that is true to the spirit, though not the letter, of his work. The key
assumption is that intended inventory accumulation follows a stock—adjustment equation
with desired inventories a linear function of expected sales:

Intended Nt+i _Nt = A{9+ ax—N],

0 A 1.

This is, in fact, a hallmark of macroeconomic work on inventories: Despite the fact that
aggregate output is more variable than sales, inventory holdings are almost always
motivated by production—smoothing. Assume further that sales (aggregate demand) are

linearly related to income (production), that sales expectations are adaptive, and that
aggregate output is the sum of expected sales plus intended inventory accumulation. Close

This does not mean that "inventory shocks" cause business cycles.

38

the model by appending the standard inventory identity. Manipulation of such a model
yields a second—order difference equation for output:

(20) t = Ayt_l — Byt_2 + C
where:

A=

1—7 +

B=

(1—7)(1—)(1—b))

C = yAa>

1—A(1—b) + b1+Aa) > 0

+ bi(1+\a) > 0

0.

and where b is the marginal propensity to spend and #y is the adaptation parameter for
expectations.
As is well—known, second-order equations like (20) can produce cycles, whereas

simpler first—order Keynesian models without inventories imply monotonicconvergence to

the steady state. Furthermore, we know today that AR(2) processes like (20) with A > 1,
B < 1 and A — B < 1 characterize GNP data rather well.40 The coefficients in (20) satisfy

these restrictions for a wide variety of reasonable parameter values. Thus the simple
Metzler model takes us remarkably far toward explaining actual GNP fluctuations.

However, Metzler noted that the inventory accelerator can make an otherwise stable
model dynamically unstable. To see this, consider the case where the characteristic

equation of (20) has complex roots, so that cycles arise. It is well known that the
parameter B controls the amplitude of the cycle. A glance at the formula for B shows that
it is less than unity when a=0; so the model is stable in the absence of an inventory
accelerator. But, B is an increasing function of a; so stronger inventory accelerators lead

to more pronounced cycles. It is even possible that a could be large enough to make B> 1
and therefore render the inventory cycle explosive. Thus, even though inventories are held
4OTlüs statement is not meant to take a position on whether there is a unit root in GNP.
Even if there is, an AR(2) like (20) gives a fairly good account of the data as long as
A — B is near one.

39

to smooth production, they can interact with the Keynesian multiplier to destabilize the
macroeconomy. This goes some way towards resolving the micro—macro paradox

mentioned at the start of this paper.
Metzler's model lacks most of the characteristic features of contemporary macro

models. If IS and LM equations and an aggregate supply curve are added, a variety of new
implications emerge. (See Blinder (1980)). Inventory investment is countercvdlical in the
very short run but predominately DrOcvclical over the business cycle. The dynamics also

generate periods of stagflation in which prices are rising while output is falling—a point

made earlier by Maccini (1976). Most interestingly, if inventories shift the demand for

labor, then real wages may be procycical, which is an empirical regularity that standard
Keynesian models have difficulty explaining.

Thus, putting inventories into even a simple Keynesian macro model leads to a
model that can produce cycles and helps to explain important empirical phenomena. As we

said, inventories matter.
B. INVENTORIES IN NEW CLASSICAL MONETARY MODELS

Both the modernized Metzler model and Blinder (1980) employ adaptive

expectations, an assumption that has been widely criticized. This assumption is not
crucial, however; stochastic models with rational expectations behave quite similarly.

Blinder and Fischer (1981) is a case in point. Their model uses IS and LM equations, a
Lucas supply function with a role for inventories:

+ W(N _Nt) +e

(21) ' = kt + 6(t

and a stock—adjustment equation of the following form:

(22) Nt+i — Nt = A(N

+ Ut,
Nt) c(pt
where N* is the desired inventory stock and e and u are stochastic errors. Equations (21)
—

—

—

and (22) say that an inventory shortfall leads to both higher output and intended inventory

40

accumulation while a price surprise leads to higher Output and inventory decumulation.
Blinder and Fischer (1981) finesse the dynamic instability problem noted by Metzler by

assuming that N* does not depend on (actual or expected) sales and that the rational
expectations solution selects the stable root. Like most new classical models, the
Blinder—Fischer model lacks an explicit labor market and hence is mum on the question of

real wages. However, its other implications are much like the Keynesian model with
inventories.

Blinder and Fischer use their model to make two points that are fairly obvious, but
are also fairly important to the debate over new classical models. First, inventories are a

natural source of persistence. Second, if N depends on the real interest rate, anticipated
changes in money are not neutral.41 Thus, if you take a new classical model with no
persistence and neutral money and add the production—smoothing motive for holding

inventories, you get a model with strong persistence and nonneutral money. The former is
theoretically obvious (Metzler knew it!), but probably of great empirical importance since
the other sources of persistence discussed in the literature probably cannot account for the
economy's short—run dynamics.42 The latter is theoretically interesting, but probably of

little empirical importance.
C. INVENTORIES AND PRICE STICKINESS
Deriving price stickiness and/or asymmetries in price adjustment from rigorous
znicrofoundations has been a longstanding intellectual challenge. In the 1980s, a series of
papers including Reagan (1982) and Blinder (1982) suggested that inventories might help

unravel the puzzle. The intuitive idea is that inventory stocks enable firms to meet part of
any change in demand by altering inventory holdings, rather than by changing prices.
4tThe latter requires interest—sensitive money demand and a real balance effect on spending.
42For a general discussion of the persistence problem in rational expectations models, see
Gordon (1981).

41.

When demand surges, supply from current production is augmented by inventory

liquidation, which reduces the price increase needed to clear the market. Conversely, when
final demand is weak, firms augment demand by building inventories, which props up
prices.

Asymmetries in the reaction of prices arise if there are stockouts.43 When demand
falls, firms can mute price increases by accumulating inventories. But, when demand
increases, firms may encounter stockouts and be forced to raise prices rather than disgorge

inventories. The conclusion is that prices may be more sticky downward than upward, as
often assumed in Keynesian models.

There is one important loose thread in these arguments, however. Like most
explanations of price rigidity based on maximizing behavior, the models implicitly deal

with real, not nominal, rigidity. What is sticky is the price relative to some numeraire.
Thus the model provides no reason for nominal rigidity. And it is nominal rigidity that is
needed to make Keynesian macroeconomics work.

Thanks to some recent work by Ball and Romer (1987), however, this criticism is

not as devastating as it first appears. Although they do not have an inventory application
in mind, Ball and Romer show that small menu costs coupled with a significant real

rigidity can lead to a substantial degree of nominal rigidity. Thus, if the previous
arguments provide a satisfactory explanation for relative price rigidity, menu costs can
turn it into an explanation of nominal price rigidity.
D. DISEQUILIBRIUM MODELS

In the 1970s, disequilibrium models based on the short—side rule or "mm condition"
became a popular mode of macroeconomic analysis.44 A key feature of these models is that

This is the main point of Reagan (1982) and of Amihud and Mendelson (1983).
44lmportant work in this area includes that of Barro and Grossman (1976) and Malinvaud
(1977). See Drazen (1980) for a survey. Inventories have been introduced into these

42

excess demand or supply in one market "spills over" into other markets. As Blinder (1980)
and Honkapohja and Ito (1980) pointed out, however, the presence of inventories limits the

extent of spillovers.
Consider, for example, the case of excess supply in the goods market. In the
standard disequilibrium model, this excess supply spills over into the labor market, because

firms that cannot sell all the output they want reduce output and employment. But, if
output is storable, firms will reduce output and employment less and accumulate the
unsold output as inventories. Thus inventories mute the spillover of excess supply in the
goods market into excess supply in the labor market.
Alternatively, suppose there is excess demand in the goods market so that workers

are unable to purchase all the goods they want at prevailing prices. In standard
disequilibrium analysis, they react by reducing their labor supply. Excess demand in the
goods market thereby spills over onto the labor market, and a rise in demand will actuaU'Xa
lower output. However, if firms hold inventories, then excess demand in the goods market

can be met out of inventories, unless the excess demand is so substantial that it leads to
widespread stockouts. Once again, the spillover effect is muted, and perhaps even
eliminated, and the negative "supply multiplier" is avoided.
E. REAL BUSINESS CYCLE MODELS

In recent years, real business cycle models have been used to analyze movements in

output and related aggregates. In these models of competitive markets which always clear,
serially correlated fluctuations in output are due primarily to productivity shocks which

arise from technological innovations, theweather, and the like. Inventories have played a
significant role in the development of at least one strain of these models.
In the influential paper of Kydland and Prescott (1982), inventories of finished
models by Benassey (1982), Green and Laffont (1981), and Eckalbar (1985).

43

goods enter the production function with the standard neoclassical properties: positive and

diminishing marginal products.45 In their "calibration" analysis, Kydland and Prescott
find that their model causes inventories to smooth production and generates a negative

correlation between inventories and output. The theory we outlined in Section llI.A.1
shows why. As we have repeatedly emphasized, however, these predictions run counter to

the facts."
Several authors have tried to reconcile the Kydland—Prescott model with the

observed behavior of inventories. Bain (1985) constructed a model in which inventories are
disaggregated into work in progress held by manufacturers and final goods held by

retailers. This extension permits manufacturing production to vary more than retail sales.
Christiano (1988) modified the Kydland—Prescott model so that agents must precommit to
employment and capital decisions before taste and technology shocks are revealed, while

inventory decisions are made later and therefore play a buffer stock role. This extension

enables the model to explain the high volatility of inventory investment relative to output
over the cycle, but coexists uneasily with the empirical difficulty of detecting a
buffer—stock role for inventories.

Unfortunately, the rationale for inventories in these models is weak. Why should
inventories of finished goods be an argument of the production function with the usual

neoclassical properties? Kydland and Prescott suggest that firms can economize on theuse
of labor resources attached to restocking, make larger production runs thereby avoiding

machine downtime, etc. These arguments are not only vague but actually suggest

45Raxney (1989) has undertaken empirical work which tests this idea for finished goods
inventories—without much success. Cooper and Haltiwanger (1989) introduce inventories
in a more conventional way into a multi-sector version of real business cycle models.
To obtain more appealing results, Kydiand and Prescott add the stock of capital goods
projects under construction—which can be interpreted as a goods in process inventory—to
finished goods to get a broader concept of inventories.

non—convexities which violate the neoclassical properties that are assumed about the

production function.
The work of Bain, however, does suggest a promising new direction: to pursue a
multi—sector approach which distinguishes between the production and distribution of

goods.47 Two recent papers push this idea in an interesting direction. Cooper and
Haltiwanger (1988) analyze a Robinson Crusoe economy in which a single agentmanages a

sector that produces a final good for consumption together with two sectors that produce

intermediate goods. An appealing interpretation is to think of the final goods sector as
retailing and the intermediate goods sectors as manufacturing. The authors show that, if it
is very costly for manufacturers to hold inventories, then a non—convextechnology (and

thus bunching) in the retail sector will induce production bunching in the manufacturing

sector, even though the production technology of the latter is convex. Given the
plausibility of (S,s)—type technologies in retailing, but not in manufacturing, this

theoretical result has evident empirical appeal.
In a similar vein, Lovell (1988) builds a multi—sector simulation model in which

firms hold inventories of both raw materials and finished goods. The raw materials are
guided by (S,s) rules while the finished goods are guided by conventional flexible

accelerators. He finds that production is more variable than final demand due to the
influence of the (S,s) policies followed by firms in managing raw materials inventories. If

firms adjust the trigger points in their (S,s) rules frequently due to changes in economic
variables, then a tremendous liquidation of stocks takes place when the cycle reaches a
cyclical peak, and vice—versa at a cyclical trough.

This style of research harks back to the early work of Lovell (1962) and Foster (1963) who
explored the stability of multi-sector models.

45

V. WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?
At present, there seem to be two well—developed microeconomic models of inventory

behavior — production smoothing and (S, s) — with a number of variants and wrinkles on
each.
The production smoothing model makes a seemingly weak assumption about

technology: that production costs are convex with zero marginal cost at zero output (or

that there is a convex cost of changing production). When economists introspect, that
seems to be a plausible characterization of technology for many manufacturing processes.

And, apparently for that reason, it has become the standard model for manufacturers'
inventories of finished goods — the most extensively studied (but least important) type of

inventory. It would be nice to have better evidence than that. The (S,s) model also makes
a simple assumption about technology, but a different one: that marginal cost is not zero at

zero. Instead, some finite fixed cost must be paid to produce anything. This sort of
technology leads to production bunching rather than to production smoothing and seems to
apply most naturally to purchases by retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers buying raw
materials and supplies.
The linear—quadratic version of the production smoothing model is easy to

aggregate because it leads to linear decision rules. Hence a micro model can readily be

turned into a macro model based on a "representative firm." (S,s) models, by contrast, are
notoriously difficult to aggregate because they have no concept of a representative agent.
However, there are approaches to aggregation that lead to empirically implementable
models; and other approaches can probably be invented.
Production smoothing has not only been the model of choice of almost all theorists

who have tried to model inventory behavior, but also underlies the stock-adjustment
model, which dominates econometric work on inventories. However, something resembling

46

an (S,s) policy appears to be widely used in business.
The production—smoothing model has trouble coping with at least three salient fact8

about inventory behavior: first, production is more variable than sales in many industries;

second, inventory investment and output do not covary negatively; third, estimated
adjustment speeds are implausibly slow. The theory can be spruced up in various ways to
make it more compatible with the first two facts. But some of these fixups look like
epicycles designed to patch up what amounts to a Ptolemaic theory.48 The (S,s) approach,
by contrast, needs no such fixups, for it coexists naturally with the basic facts.
We have mentioned several times in this essay the micro—macro paradox:

Inventories, which are supposed to stabilize production at the micro level, apparently
destabilize output at the micro level. The (S,s) model sees no paradox because it views
inventories as a way to make production more variable than sales even at the micro level.
The production—smoothing model resolves the paradox through the interaction of the

Metzlerian inventory accelerator (the idea that desired inventory stocks rise with sales) and
the Keynesian multiplier. Neoclassical models with inventories have a hard time coping

with this problem.
Of course, production smoothing and (S,s) are not the only games in town. There

may be other models — such as stockouts — which work better than either, both
theoretically and empirically. Alternatively, multi—sector models where some sectors are
driven by production smoothing policies and others by (S,s) policies show a good deal of

promise. But, if forced to choose between the two, the weight of the evidence to date

seems to point strongly in the direction of (S,s). And this despite the fact that the contest
is one sided: There has been vastly more work done within the production-smoothing
48An exception is cost shocks, which are natural explanations of the first two facts.
However, many authors, including the present ones, have a hard time believing that cost
shocks dominate demand shocks.

47

framework than within the (S,s) framework.
(S,s) models ale lately being applied to problems as diverse as purchases of

consumer durables, price setting, portfolio choices, and industrial entry and exit.49 Given
this burgeoning interest in (S,s)—type reasoning in a wide variety of areas, it would indeed

be strange if the (S,s) model were forsaken in the area in which it originated: inventory
behavior.
