    "abstract": "\n\nStriking evidence is presented of a previously unremarked transformation of urban structure from mainly sectoral to mainly functional specialization.  We offer an explanation showing that this transformation is inextricably interrelated with changes in firms' organization.  A greater variety of business services for headquarters and of sector-specific intermediates for production plants within a city reduces costs, while congestion increases with city size.  A fall in the costs of remote management leads to a transformation of the equilibrium urban and industrial structure.  Cities shift from specializing by sector -- with integrated headquarters and plants -- to specializing mainly by function -- with headquarters and business services clustered in larger cities, and plants clustered in smaller cities.\n\n",
