Macroeconomic Policies in the OECD
and LDC External Adjustment

ABSTRACT

In this paper, the authors describe a simulation model for analyzing the
effects of macroeconomic policies in the OECD on global macroeconomic

equilibrium. Particular attention is paid to the effects on developing
countries of alternative mixes of monetary and fiscal policies in the OECD.
Though the model is quite small, it has several properties which make it

attractive for policy analysis. First, the important stock-flow relationships
and intertemporal budget constraints are carefully observed, so that the model

is useful for short—run and long—run analysis. Budget deficits, for example,
cumulate into a stock of public debt which must be serviced, while current

account deficits cumulate into a stock of foreign debt. Second, the asset
markets are forward looking, so that the exchange rate is conditioned by the
entire future path of policies rather than by a set of short-run expectations.

Third, the model is amenable to policy optimization exercises, and in particular
can be used to study the effects of policy coordination versus non-coordination
in the OECD, on global macroeconomic equilibrium.

Macroeconomic Policies in the OECD and
LDC External kdjustment

This paper describes a simulation model for analyzing the effects of
macroeconomic policies in the OECD on global macroeconomic equilibrium.

Particular attention is paid to the effects on developing countries of

alternative mixes of monetary and fiscal policies in the OECD. Though the model
is quite small, it has several properties which make it attractive for policy

analysis. First, the important stock—flow relationships and intertemporal
budget constraints are carefully observed, so that the model is useful for

short—run and long—run analysis. Budget deficits, for example, cumulate into a
stock of public debt which must be serviced, while current account deficits

cumulate into a stock of foreign debt. Second, the asset markets are forward
looking, so that the exchange rate is conditioned by the entire future path of

policies rather than by a set of short—run expectations. Third, the model is
amenable to policy optimization exercises, and in particular can be used to
study the effects of policy coordination versus non—coordination in the OECD, on
global macroeconomic equilibrium.

In Section I of this paper, the model is described in detail, and the basic
numerical parameterization is also set out. Section lIt presents various policy
multipliers, for fiscal and monetary impulses in the U.S. and the rest of the

OECD. In Section III, we show how optimizing policies in the OECD will differ
depending on the degree of macroeconomic policy coordination between the U.S.

and the rest of the OECD. The developing countries are shown to be quite
strongly affected by the absence of effective policy coordination among the

—2—

developed economies. Section IV

treats

the welfare implications of OECD

policies for the developing countries. We distinguish appropriate welfare
measurements from simpler 'out commonly used measures involving LDC exports to

the OECD. In Section V we present an historical simulation exercise which
examines the implicatons of coordinated policy in response to the 1919 OPEC oil

price shock. Section VI examines the impact of a shift in the U.S.
monetary/fiscal mix (commencing in l984) towards smaller fiscal deficits and

more expansionary monetary policy. The main conclusions are summarized in
Section VII.

I.

The Simulation Model

A.

Theoretical Framework
The model is for a four—region division of the world economy: the U.S.,

the rest of the OECD (hereafter denoted OECD), OPEC and the non—oil developing

countries (hereafter denoted LDCs). t this point, only the developed country
bloc has an internal macroeconomic structure; the non—oil L]DCs and OPEC blocs

embrace only the foreign trade aspects of these economies. Thus, while we can
measure the effects of U.S. policies on LDC exports, we do not yet attempt to
study the effects of LDC exports on internal macroeconomic equilibrium in the
LDCs.

Each region produces a single output, which is an imperfect substitute in

consumption for the outputs of the other regions. Thus, each region consumes
the outputs of the other three, with relative consumption demands depending on the

relative prices of the three goods. The notation C will signify the quantity

—3--

of consumption by country i of the output of country j. Superscripts and
subscripts U, 0, P and L signify the U.S., OECD, OPEC and the LDCs,

respectively. The trade matrix linking the four regions is given in Table 1.

We assume that growth of potential GDP in the U.S. and OECD is at a
constant rate of n percent per year (n =

3%

in the simulations that follow).

All quantities, such as actual GDP (Q) or exports (C) are defined per unit of
potential GDP. We adopt the normalization that potential GDP in the U.S.
equals 1.0, and that all prices are 1.0 in the baseline (this fixes the values

of the remaining quantities). Thus, the same values of C in years t and t+l
signify an actual quantity of exports that is growing at the rate n. Similarly,

the level of GDP in the U.S. (QU) is per unit of potential GDP, so that Q = .9
for example, signifies a 10% output gap relative to potential in any year t.
In the U.S. and OECD, output is demand determined along conventional lines.

-t In

any period, the nominal wage (we) is predetermined, and domestic prices

are a fixed markup over the wage. Consumer prices are a geometric weighted
average of domestic and foreign prices, with weights equal to initial

expenditure shares. Thus, in the U.S., we have:

cu =

(1)

pUl(POE)2(PL)3(PP)l23

(where no ambiguity will result, we drop the time subscript for period t). Here
P0 is the OECD output price in the local currency (the "ECU" for convenience),
and E is the nominal exchange rate, in $/ECU. F" is the $-.price of LDC

output and PP is the $—price of OPEC output (i.e. oil). Note that while

P

is predetermined in period t, Pis not, since any of

and P may change

in period t.

ggregate demand is the sum of private domestic absorption (D), exports net

of imports, and government spending. Note that

There are counterpart equations for aggregate demand and absorption in the OECD.
Note that current absorption is written as a function of current disposable

income rather than permanent income. This specification of course builds in a
strong anti—Ricardian presumption that the time path of taxes affects the time
path of private absorption, even for a given discounted value of the tax burden.
Alternative specifications, such as in Blanchard (l98)-), would allow for a
partial dependence of the absorption path on the path of taxes.

The real interest rate in (3) is the own—rate on U.S. goods. Letting
be the nominal interest rate, we have:
U =

In principal, the equation should have the ex ante expectation of

with perfect foresight, we assume (÷1)E =

Let

÷ T(Q_Q1). Next, by the assumption of a fixed price markup over wages, so
that domestic price change equals wage change, we write:

The wealth term H in (3) comprises financial wealth of the private sector.

Here we make some strong portfolio assumptions to simplify the model. U.S.
residents hold two types of claims: U.S. $—denominated government debt and

—6—

$—denominated loans to the LDCs. U.S. residents hold no OECD assets. OECD
residents hold three types of assets: U.S. $—denominated claims on U.S.
residents, OECD ECU—denominated government debt, and ECU—denominated claims on

the LDCs. OPEC holds $—denominated claims on the U.S., OECD and LDCs. Both the
U.S. and OECI) governments hold official claims on the LDCs which are issued at

concessional rates. As with the consumption of various country outputs, it is
convenient to adopt the following notation for each country's holding of the

other country's assets. All asset stocks are defined in real terms, with B°,
and A in units of OECD goods, and all the rest in real U.S. $.

(where each asset is per unit of U.S. potential GDP). Note that as an

accounting matter all BU is held in the U.S., but since A and A are perfect

There are two limitations to this specification. Importantly, equity wealth is
ignored (a proper treatment of equity wealth, as in Sachs (1983), would involve

a substantial increase in complexity of the model). Second. real high—powered
money balances are also not counted as part of wealth. This change would be
easy to make but would probably not cause any major quantitative change to the
model.

Let DEF be the inflation—adjusted fiscal deficit (relative to potential GDP):
DEFU =

GU

+ rBu - TU -

VUB

Here, BL is official holdings of claims on LDCs and v is the (concessional)
real rate of interest on these assets. (Note that the standard deficit measure

would include nominal interest payments, 1BU, rather than real interest
payments, rBU. DEF improves upon the standard measure by being directly related

the change in the real value of the government's debt.) The change in
is related to DEF as:

to

B1 =

The term 1 +
at

n

(B+DEF)/(1+n)

arises since B is

measured relative to potential GDP, which grows

the rate n. We assume that v adjusts slowly to a given fraction of rU,

according to the equation v =

where t—statistics are given in parentheses. This implies that in the steady
state v =

.72r,

i.e. the concessional interest rate is 72 percent of the market

rate.

It remains to specify the import demand functions for the economy. Imports
are written as proportional to national absorption (DU+GU), and as a negative

function of the relative import price. In particular, we assume an elasticity
of demand of —1.5 for the OECD good, —1.0 for the LDC good and —.2 for the OPEC
good.

The structural equations for the OECD are in almost all respects the same
as for the U.S. The major exception is the portfolio block, since OECD
residents hold U.S. assets while U.S. residents do not hold OECD assets. We

substitutes in the OECD portfolio, and that H° =

make several simplifying assumptions to determine the change in each asset

stock. For the official loans to LDCs from both the U.S. and OECD, (4,4), we
assume a constant path per unit of potential U.S. GDP (i.e. a growth of 3% per

period in the stock of official debt). In addition we allow for some deviation
from this path as private loans rise or fall. This leads to the following equation:

Bt+i

(in)

=

4t

+

0.14÷1(l+n)

—

We also assume that the change in LDC debt held by private agents in the

OECD is a constant proportion of the flow supply of new LDC debt. In other
words, LDC debt is financed in fixed proportions by the U.S., the OECD and OPEC.

The proportion financed by each region is determined by the share of each region

in the total stock of LDC debt in the initial steady state. Therefore the

changes in 4 and

a proportion a1 of the LDC current account deficit (net of official

flows) is financed by ECU loans, a proportion a9 by OPEC loans, and the rest

(1—a1—a2) by U.S. resident loans. Remember that the (1+n) arises because the

—11—

assets stocks are measured per unit of potential GDP, which grows at the rate n.
The remaining equations detail the foreign trade and finance of OPEC and

the LDCs. The fundamental presumption here is that foreign borrowing of the

LDCs is determined by the E4 of loans from the U.S., OECD, and OPEC, rather
than the demand for loans. For reasons described in many theoretical studies of
foreign lending, this form of credit rationing results from the risk of debt

repudiation by the LDCs. New foreign financing (i.e. measured by the current
account deficit) is written as a function of three variables.

First, we assume

that there is inertia in the quantity of net lending, so CA is a function of

CA1. Second, net new lending is a decreasing function of the existing stock
of debt. Third, net new lending is an increasing function of the value of LDC
exports to the U.S., OECD and OPEC. Specifically, we write:

Here, the LDC current account balance is in constant U.S. dollar prices (i.e.

so that the current account deficit, nDEBTt, is exactly enough to

keep the foreign debt growing at the rate n. In this way, the debt/export ratio

Now we turn to the pricing of LDC output.

is the nominal price

of LDC output in U.S. dollars. It is set as a variable markup over a basket of
U.S., OECD and OPEC goods, where the markup depends on the volume of LDC exports

to these regions. From (18), the LDC import price index should be written

we adopt the following pricing rule:

as S, and to point out that each one percent

increase in LDC export volume raises the LDC terms of trade by 1L percent. In

the simulations, we choose 1L =

0.5.

Finally, we turn to the equations for the OPEC bloc. The equations for
OPEC imports and the pricing of OPEC output are derived in the same manner as

for the LDCs. In deriving the OPEC current account equation we assume that OPEC
adjusts its consumption expenditure to reach a target ratio of wealth to

income. The specific form of the equation is the following:

CAt = I(P(Cp+Cp+Cp)t(P IF

the desired ratio of wealth to income. A rise in OPEC income leads to

a short—run improvement in OPEC's current account, until assets are accumulated

CA =

the following holds:

so that the current account surplus (nH) is sufficient to keep wealth growing

using

data for the current account and exports of oil exporting countries and data for

purposes, it is

simpler to work with a linearized version of the

model of T&ble 3 (this is particularly true when we study the optimal policy

packages of the U.S. and the OECD). Thus, in practice, the model of Table 3 is

linearized in the following way. All price variables, e.g., P, are
re—interpreted as the exponents of log prices. Thus, we write log prices by

all log prices at 0.0). Thus, upon linearization, the AL equation is simply

us now turn to the numerical parameterization of the model. In

calibrating the model, we require coefficients for structural equations, trade

and expenditure shares and initial asset stocks. The initial asset stocks are
required for the linearization. A list of key assumed parameter values for the

coefficients of the structural equations is shown in Table 4 As a starting
point for empirical investigation, and in lieu of econometric estimates, the
U.S. and OECD are treated as having the same structure in aggregate demand,

pricing, and money demand. The only differences between the regions are in the
composition and direction of trade (which are directly measurable in the data),
and in portfolio preferences (where the differences are to some degree
measurable in the data, as well as being based on the general observation that
international debts are predominantly denominated in U.S. dollars).

The direction and composition of trade is based on 1983 trade data of the IMF

country exports to the LDCs. The first measure yields an

underestimate and the second yields an overestimate of OPEC exports to the LDCs.

Both measures were then averaged to get the figure in the table. A similar

1983. We now describe the procedures followed to derive these estimates. The
data sources include: IMF World Economic Outlook (WE0), World Debt
Tables(WDT), World Bank (WB), Economic Report of the President (ERP) and

Mattione (1983).

•

LDC debt

We assume that total LDC gross debt is 16% short term debt (less than

1 year to maturity) and 8% long term debt (see WEO, Table 31). Of the long term
debt 39% is held by official creditors and 61% by private creditors. Assuming
that short term debt is all private creditors, this implies that total LDC debt
is 33% official creditor and 61% private creditor.
Using currency composition of long debt (source WB) we find that 78% of

long debt is in $US and 22% is in ECU (where all the residual, 6%, is allocated
to $us). Note that "ECU" debt here signifies an OECD currency of denomination

other than the U.S. dollar. Assuming that short debt is all $US denominated,
this

implies total debt is 82% US and 18% ECU. By further calculation from data

—24—

on the currency compositon of LDC debt we estimate the currency composition of

the debt, disaggregated into the type of creditor, given in Table 6. Note that
the cateogry "$US official debt" includes loans from international agencies.

Debt is also distinguished by the nature of the interest charges, in particular
whether the rate is fixed or floating (i.e. pegged to a short—term rate such as

LIBOR), and whether the rate is at market terms or concessional terms. For our
purposes, we will treat all market—determined rates in a particular currency to
be at the same level (i.e. we will not distinguish the rates on fixed versus

floating securities). We do, of course, make a separate allowance for market

versus concessional rates. LDC Gross Debt is given in Table 7. Net debt is
calculated by subtracting LDC reserves from the gross debt.

By applying the share of each type of creditor in total debt to the gross
debt figure in Table 6, we are able to derive the breakdown of debt given in

Table 8. Since we are only allowing for a market interest rate and a
concessional interest rate, the private creditor debt is aggregated and assumed
to be earning a market rate whereas the official creditor debt is assuned to be

earning the concessional interest rate. The breakdown of net debt into type of

lender is shown in Table 9. It is derived assuming that 70% of LDC reserves
are in $US and 30% in ECU (see Kenen (1983), p. 17', where we assume that all

unspecified sources are $us). We subtract the value of 10% of LDC reserves from
U.S. market rate loans, assuming that LDC reserves earn market rates.
Accordingly we subtract the value of 30% of LDC reserves from ECU market rate

loans. The stocks are then converted into shares of US GDP (l98) where US GDP
in 198)4 is used to be consistent with the timing in the model.

OPEC Holdings of US, OECD and LDC assets

We base our calculations of OPEC asset holdings on data contained in
Mattione (1983; Table I.)4). The data is only available for the beginning of

1983. Therefore we derive the proportions to 1983 GDP and assume the same

ratios for end of 1983. Our assumptions are presented in Table 10. We assume

that 70% of OPEC assets are held in dollars (Mattione, p. 21). Assume that
OPEC holds $86,Ib in claims against U.S. residents in the U.S. (Mattione, Table
114) and $714b in claims against the LDCs (WEO, p. 58). This implies that the

remainder of claims held by OPEC in dollars are held in the OECD ($lO3.ltb). We
assume that these claims are held in Eurodollar deposits in Europe and are

effectively claims against U.S. citizens. These OPEC claims against U.S.
citizens held in Europe are then added to the OPEC claims against U.S. citizens

—28—

held

in the U.S. to get the total OPEC claims against the U.S., given in

Table 10. This gives $190.lb or 50% of total OPEC asset holdings as claims
against the US. The remaining 50% is divided between holdings of dollar
denominated LDC assets (20%) and ECU—denominated OECD assets (30%).

•

U.S. Assets
We still need to derive the initial stock of US assets held by OECD

residents and the outstanding stock of US and OECD government bonds. From the
Economic Report of the President (198)4) we have the net asset position of the

in 1983. We can add to

the net U.S. holdings of claims against the LDCs and subtract the net OPEC

beginning

holdings of claims against the U.S. (held in the U.S.) to arrive at a figure for

net OECD claims against the U.S. We assume a figure of $280b (.088 as a share
of 1983 U.S. GDP). We use the total US government debt held by private agents

net of Federal Reserve holdings as the stock of Government debt. From ERP
(198)4) this is equal to $986b at the end of 1983 (.2y of 198)4 U.S. GD?).

•

OECD Asset Holdings
We have already derived the OECD holdings of US and LDC assets and the

claims against the OECD held by OPEC. We assume that the outstanding stock of
OECD government debt

is the same proportion of OECD GD? as the US stock is

of US

GDP. This give a figure for the stock of outstanding OECD govenment debt as a
proportion

of US GD? for the end of 1983 of .315.

II. Numerical Simulations
Using the parameterization just described, we now study five types of
?disturbancestt in the model: (1) a sustained U.S. fiscal policy expansion (1%
of US GDP); (2) a sustained U.S. monetary policy expansion (1% of MU); (3) a
sustained OECD fiscal policy expansion (1% of OECD GOP); (14) a sustained OECD

monetary expansion (i of M°); and (5) a portfolio shift away from
dollar—denominated assets, toward ECU—denominated assets.
The model was simulated using two alternative techniques for solving

dynamic rational expectations models. These were multiple shooting (see Lipton
et al., 1982), and the Fair—Taylor method (see Fair and Taylor, 1983). We found
that if either technique ran into convergence problems the other technique

—30—

overcame the problem.

Table 12 shows various aspects of a sustained, bond—financed U.S. fiscal
expansion, beginning in 19814. The fiscal expansion begins as a 1% of GDP rise

in government expenditure, with no change in taxes. Over time, the higher
expenditure level is left unchanged, but taxes are raised in line with rising

debt—service changes, in order to keep the deficit constant at 1% of GDP. To
read the table, note that tP%?f

"D" signifies the level deviation from the initial baseline; "$bl"
signifies billions of dollars deviation from •the initial baseline; and t$814?

baseline;

signifies the devaluation from baseline in constant, 19814 dollars.

In the case of a U.S. fiscal expansion, we have a rise in U.S. GDP of
0.9 percent relative to the baseline in the first year, and lower inflation of

0.2 percentage points. The inflation reduction has two sources: on the one
hand, the exchange rate appreciates 3.14 percent, which contributes to reduced

import prices; on the other hand, the inflationary effects of the fiscal

expansion via the Phillips curve do not operate (by assumption) until 1985. In
the second year of the shock, inflation is 0.2 percentage points higher than the

baseline. U.S. short—term interest rates rise by 0.8 percentage points
(80 basis points) above the baseline in 19814, and are 1.3 percentage points

above baseline in the third year of the shock. The U.S. current account worsens
by-

$16b,

or 0.14 percent of GDP, in 19814, and continues to worsen for the next

three years.
As explained in Sachs and Wyplosz (19814), the short—run appreciation of the

dollar is reversed in the long run, as the OECD claims on the U.S. rise over

time. Figure 1 shows the 55—year trajectory of the real and nominal exchange
rate. After an initial jump appreciation of 3.14 percent, the nominal exchange
rate peaks at 3.5 percent appreciation relative to baseline, and then gradually

depreciates over the remaining time. Just as the appreciation in the early
years helps to export inflation, the subsequent depreciation may be thought of
as a re—import of the inflation. However, even though the inflationary gains
from onrrency appreolation are temporary, it may

still he

deirahle

to induce a

real appreciation at the beginning of a disinflation program, since on a path of
declining inflation, the appreciation exports inflation when inflation is high
(and therefore socially costly), while the subsequent depreciation re—imports

inflation when it is low. We return to this argument later.
The table also outlines various effects of the U.S. expansion on the rest

of the world. OECD GDP rises by 0.9 percent in the first year, though it falls

relative to baseline in 1986—81. Inflation rises on impact, as the ECU
depreciation raises OECD import prices. ECU nominal interest rates are pulled

up in line with U.S. rates. The expansion has three effects on LDC foreign
trade. First, the rise in interest rates raises the interest servicing bill, by
$2.lb in 19814. Second, the dollar price of LDC exports and imports both
fall.

falls by 1.8 percent in 19814, due to the 3.14 percent dollar

appreciation. The import price index falls by 2.3 percent, so that the LDC
terms of trade improve slightly, by .5 percent. Third, export volumes rise, as
the real economic activity in the U.S. and OECD both increase. In fact, the
percentage rise in export volumes is less than the fall in trade prices, so that

dollar values of LDC exports actually fall. Note that the rise in export

volumes allows a i.1 percent increase in import volumes in 198)4. As we shall
see, the welfare implications of these three effects are, on balance, negative,
since the small terms—of—trade gain does not outweigh the losses from higher
interest rates.

The implications of a U.S. monetary expansion are shown next, in Table 13.
A U.S. monetary expansion causes a more inflationary boom in the U.S., as the

exchange rate now depreciates on impact. Per unit of GDP gain, monetary policy
is more inflationary than fiscal policy. Also, per unit of GDP gain, the
worsening of the U.S. current account is less with monetary policy than with

fiscal policy. These differential effects of U.S. monetary and fiscal policy

have the following implications in the model. A policy mix of expansionary
fiscal policy (G increases by 1.1 percent of GDP), and contractionary monetary
policy (M declines by 0.9 percent), causes:

• no output change
• an inflation reduction of —0.2

percentage

points in the first year

• a worsening of the current account of $15.8b in the first year
As

long as the current account is not a short—run target, the "Mundellian mix"

of loose G, tight M is an attractive anti—inflationary mix.
Note

the effects of a U.S. monetary expansion on the rest of the world.

Contrary to the case of U.S. fiscal policy, the monetary experience brings net

benefits to the LDCs. Interest rates (particularly real interest rates) are
reduced by the money expansion. The interest burden falls $l.9b in 198)4, and
though it rises slightly in nominal terms in 1985 and 1986 ($0.3b and $0.6b),

it falls as well in later years when measured in real terms. Specifically, the

The U.S. monetary expansion slightly worsens the LDC terms of trade by
0.1 percent in l981 but improves it thereafter, and it increases the prices of

exports and imports relative to U.S. prices. We show later that an
equiproportional rise in the real price of exports and imports (relative to pUS)
is welfare worsening as long as the LDCs are running trade balance deficits along
the pre—shock path.
The major differences in effects of OECD policy and U.S. policy lie in the

differing effects on the exchange rate. As seen in Tables li and 15, an OECD
fiscal expansion strengthens the ECU, while a monetary expansion weakens the

ECU. Following an OECD fiscal expansion, the dollar price of LDC exports rises,
while it falls with a U.S. expansion.
A final experiment, shown in Table 16, is the case of a portfolio shift in

the private sector, away from $

assets and towards ECU assets. We include this

case for two reasons. First, there is a school of thought which attributes at
least part of the post—'19 rise of the dollar to a "safe haven" effect on the

U.S., pulling in funds from abroad. This safe haven effect may be modelled as a
portfolio shift, and can therefore be read off of Table 16, with the signs

reversed. Second, there is also some debate as to the dangers from a reversal
of that effect in coming years, often stated as the question: "What happens in
the near future when European and Japanese asset holders recognize the
implications of the looming U.S. current account deficits and start to 'move

out' of dollars?" The shock is modelled as an intercept shift (dl <

The magnitude of dl is selected so that the dollar depreciates by about 13
percent on impact. As expected, such a shift raises U.S. interest rates and

0 P

0
reduces European interest rates, since the existing stocks of Au, AL and B

must be willingly held by OECD residents, even after dollar assets lose some of

their attractiveness. U.S. inflation rises, while OECD inflation falls, in view
of the dollar depreciation. Given the presumed elasticities of trade flows,

U.S. GDP rises, as the expansionary effect of the real exchange rate
depreciation outweighs the contractionary effect of rising interest rates, while

OECD GDP falls. As usual, we identify three effects on LDC welfare. First, the
dollar depreciation raises the price of LDC exports and imports in terms of U.S.

goods. Second, there is an ambiguous effect on the LDC terms of trade, since

U.S. GDP rises, while OECD GDP falls. In fact, the LDC TOT worsens by
0.8 percent. Finally, U.S. real interest rates rise, raising the debt servicing
burden on the developing countries. Note that (real) interest payments increase
by a total of $ll.Ob in the first three years following the portfolio shift.

III. The Implications of Policy

Coordination

In several recent papers (including Oudiz and Sachs, 19814a, and Oudiz and

Sachs, l984b), we have investigated the implications of policy coordination for

macroeconomic equilibrium in a multi—country poitcy setting. One theme has
emerged repeatedly. In a regime of floating exchange rates, and in an
environment with high initial inflation, policymakers in each country have an

—41—

incentive to choose a policy mix to strengthen their currency, thereby exporting

inflation abroad. This strategic attempt may beggar the country's trading
partners (by forcing them to import inflation), but even more importantly, it

may leave all countries worse off than under alternative policies. The policy
inefficiency arises because the mutual attempts to export inflation cancel out
(at least partially), while the mechanisms by which the currency appreciation is

attempted impose a direct cost In particular, countries may be led to pursue
overly restrictive monetary policies and overly expansionary fiscal policies,

for exchange rate purposes. High interest rates will be a side effect of this

non—cooperative process. We have shown that a

equilibrium allows

a more balanced (and presumably more desirable) policy mix.

Earlier work has called into question the quantitative importance of policy
coordination (the qualitative importance may be established on theoretical

grounds alone). In Oudiz and Sachs (l9Ba), we found in a threecountry game
that the gains to the U.S., Germany, and Japan are rather modest. This paper
points out an aspect of the issue not previously remarked upon. Even if the
gains within the developed country region are rather small, the LDCs may have a
great deal at stake in successful coordination among the advanced countries.
After all, the LDCs are large losers in any process which promotes high real
interest rates, as does the adoption. of a mix with expansionary fiscal and

contractionary monetary policies. Since the move to coordination reduces real
interest rates, the LDCs prove to be large beneficiaries in the process.

The analytical framework for studying policy coordination is complex, and

a self—contained discussion would necessarily be lengthy. Here, we merely

—42--

present some simulation results based on the techniques developed in our earlier

papers. In particular, we postulate intertemporal policy objective functions,
for the U.S. and the rest of the OECD, of the form:

(23)

=

oot(UCUUU)

(21k)

V0 =

tv(QOxCOcAODEFO)

Thus, welfare in each country depends on the time path of the output gap,

inflation, current account deficit, and budget deficit. A quadratic form for
=

V is selected. Specifically, we assume
for V that we select is V =

0.5Q

+

1.o()2

(1/1.1)
+

and the quadratic form

O.5CA

+

O.lDEF.

In the

non—cooperative setting, U.S. policymakers select U.S. policies (4U,GU,TU) to
maximize VU, subject to the policies selected by the UECD; while OECI)

authorities similarly select policies to maximize V0, subject to the choices in

the U.S. In the cooperative setting, a single policy controller chooses

The specific

numerical techniques for finding the equilibria are quite involved, requiring a

repeated application of dynamic programming. Details may be found in Oudiz and
Sachs (l98lb).

We show in this section that non—cooperative policymakers with the

—43--

objective functions in (23) and (24), choose a high interest rate strater for
disinflation with the goal of maintaining a strong currency. Under cooperation
the same goals are reached with sharply reduced interest rates, to the benefit

of the LDCs. The gain to the LDCs is, strictly speaking, a loss to the
developed countries rather than a pure efficiency gain from cooperation. With
lower interest rates, the LDCs pay less to their creditors in the U.S., OECD and
OPEC, so that the real transfer burden is reduced.

Why would the policy authorities in the TJS. and OECD coordinate in such a

way as to reduce the flow of real income from the LDCs? One reason is that
real GDP, and not real income, enters their objectives in (23) and (21). The
policy authorities are assumed not to care directly about the size of the real
interest payments from the LDCs (they care insofar as those payments indirectly

affect output, inflation, the current account, etc.). The effects of
coordination on real interest rates are therefore incidental to the effects on

output, inflation, and the other targets in the developed countries. We
believe that this is an accurate reflection of the policy goals in the U.S. and
the rest of the OECD, We have also tried including interest flows in the
objective functions by using GNP rather than GDP as a target. The effect was to
alter the quantitive results, with a modest reduction in the gains for the LDCs

from coordination, although the qualitative results remained unchanged. The
gains to the LDCs remain significant, it appears, because the effects of
monetary and fiscal policies on output and inflation in the developed countries
are far more important, in quantitive terms, than the effects of these policies

on interest flows from the LDCs. For example a monetary contraction of 1%

—44—

reduces U.S. output by $140 billion while increasing interest payments from the

LDCs by less than $2 billion. Thus monetary and fiscal policy seem to be geared
primarily to output and inflation, as we assume, rather than to the size of
interest transfers from the LDCs.

Thus we stress again that the gains to the LDCs from US—OECD coordination
are, by and large not efficiency gains, but transfer gains, that result from

policy shifts related to inflation and output in the developed countries. The
high real interest rates of the last four years have been the side effects of a
particular disinflation strategy, rather than an attempt to extract extra

interest payments from the LDCs. Similarly, a reduction in real interest rates
from greater coordination of policies would have a salutary, if unintended,
effect on LDC welfare.

In Tables 11 and 18 we compare the non—cooperative and cooperative

equilibria. As an illustration, we assume that both the U.S. and the OECD

inherit a10t inflation rate, and then pursue policies of disinflation.
In the non—cooperative setting, both regions embark on a mix of sharp fiscal
expansion and monetary contraction in the attempt of both to keep their

currencies strong. The policy ndx for the U.S. is shown in Figure 2. The
monetary policy calls for a decrease of 12 percent in MU in the first year of
the disinflation, followed by a return to fast money growth two years later.
Basically, this policy involves a large one—shot reduction in the path of MU/PU.
Fiscal policy, on the other hand, is extremely expansionary, with the deficit

rising briefly to 5 percent of GDP. A similar set of actions is undertaken
abroad, though given the specific parameter assumptions of the model the overall

mix yields a $

appreciation

of 5.5 percent. The U.S. nominal interest rate

rises to 21.1 percent in the first year of the disinflation. (Note that the
table shows an interest rate increase of 16.1, which is the difference of 21.1
percent and the baseline 5 percent rate.)
Under a cooperative policy regime, in which the weighting of the U.S. in
overall utility is 0.5 (with the OECD at 0.5), both the U.S. and OECD reach
higher levels of interterriporal utility with far less extreme policy mixes. In
Figure 3, we show the optimal paths of IJ.S. monetary and fiscal policy in the

cooperative regime. Now, the initial U.S. money contraction is 7 percent in the
first year, with no initial fiscal expansion. Nominal interest rates in the
U.S. rise to 15.14

percent,

a high level, but far below the 21.1 percent level

reached in the non—cooperative case. The dollar also appreciates by less, now
14.3 percent rather than 5.5 percent.

The effects of a move from non—cooperation to cooperation are significant
for the LDCs. Comparing Tables 17 and 18, we find the LTDC import volumes drop by
11.1 percent in the wake of non—cooperative disinflation, and by only 8.8

percent in the course of cooperative disinflation. LDC nominal interest
payments on the external debt are almost $2lb higher in 19814 in the case of

non—cooperative disinflation. In the next section we offer a more careful
accounting of the welfare effects of the shift to cooperation.

IV. Macroeconomic Policies in the U.S. and OECD,
and LDC Economic Welfare
Standard trade theory prescribes a simple measure of the welfare effects of

external shocks. Consider an initial path of LDC exports, imports, and foreign

—49—

borrowing.

When interest rates and trade prices change, we can ask how large an

income transfer the LDCs would require to allow them to purchase the initial
import basket, with unchanged levels of real exports and real foreign

indebtedness. This income transfer measures the "compensating variation" that
keeps the LDCs as well off as before the external changes.

From (21), we find that the required transfer (or compensating variation)

has three components. First, when real interest rates rise, the transfers must
increase by the change in real interest rates times the appropriate components

of real debt. Second, when real export prices in terms of U.S. goods, AL
increase, the transfer is reduced if the debtor country is running surpluses
(TBL >

0),

and is increased if the debtor country is running deficits. Third,

the transfer must be raised when the terms of trade deteriorates, i.e.
—

dA/A

>

0, by the percentage of the terms—of—trade deterioration times

the value of total imports. The total "loss" to the LDCs is measured by the sum
of these three effects.

In Table 19, we provide some calculations of di (or total loss) for

various policy changes. In order to make the calculations, we start with a
baseline scenario given at the bottom of the table. In particular, we need

values for TB,

and the components of DEBTt, which are then

multiplied by the price and interest rate changes. For instance, we assume that
LDC net debt rises from $595b to $650b ($198)4) between 198)4 and 1981. The trade

balance moves from —$lO.5b to —$ll.6b. The import bill rises from $31i.1th to
$3'r6b.

According to the table, a U.S. fiscal expansion reduces LDC welfare by
$O.lb in the first year (i.e. requires a transfer of that amount as a

compensating variation). First, A1 falls, and since the LDCs have TBL < 0 along
the baseline path, the result is a favorable "export price" effect of $0.2b. In
addition, the terms of trade improves, reducing the required transfer by

$l.8b. Finally, interest rates rise, with drDt =
transfer required is therefore —$0.2b

$l.8b +

$2.lb

$2.lb

=

in 198)4. The net

$0.lb.

Note that a

U.S. monetary expansion, as opposed to fiscal expansion, would raise LDC

welfare, since the dominating interest rate effect would be beneficial. As
shown in the table, a U.S. monetary contraction is very harmful, in terms of
interest rates initially, and subsequently also in terms of export prices and
the terms of trade.

It is important to recognize that a U.S. fiscal expansion is more

beneficial to the LDCs than an OECD fiscal expansion. This is despite the fact
that LDC debt is $ denominated, and the OECD fiscal expansion causes both a

nominal and real dollar depreciation. In fact, as shown, an OECD fiscal
expansion lowers LDC welfare by $0.5b in the first year, whereas the same

stimulus from the U.S. reduces LDC welfare by $0.lh. The main differences are
that the OECD expansion raises AL while the U.S. expansion reduces it and the

terms of trade of LDCs improves more under the U.S. fiscal expansion. Even

—53—

though the OECD expansion has much less effect on the U.S. real interest rate

than does the U.S. expansion, the terms of trade and export price effects
dominate the utility loss.

An OECD monetary contraction has less of a negative effect on the LDCs

because of the smaller effect on U.S. interest rates. The OECD decline in money
causes the dollar to depreciate, and actually reduces U.S. real interest rates.
The final set of numbers refers to the LDC loss in utility from
non—cooperative as opposed to cooperative policies between the U.S. and the

OECD. As we have already shown, non—cooperation induces a policy stance of
loose fiscal and tight monetary policies, and extremely high real and nominal

interest rates. We saw in Tables 17 and 18 that r98 is more than 5 percentage
points higher in the non.-cooperative regime. As seen in Table 19, this
translates into a welfare loss of $16.1b in l984, falling to $ll.3b in 1985, and
$llb in 1986.

It is important to reconcile the utility measurements of Table 19 with an
alternative view that holds the U.S. fiscal expansion to be beneficial to the

LDCs, by raising LDC exports. The calculations of Table 19 measure the
increased costs of imports plus debt servicing, due to changes in interest and

prices, for a given level of export volumes. Implicit in the calculation is the
assumption that changes in export volumes have no first—order utility effects.
Thus, even though the rise in GU stimulates LDC exports, that fact is given no
weight in the welfare calculation.
According to the standard trade measurement, the price of exports measures
the opportunity cost of exports, so that a $1 increase in exports (at given

—54—

prices) reduces the production of other goods (e.g. non—tradeables or leisure)

by $1. Thus, changes in export volumes merely reflect a substitution of one
output for another, at equal social value on the margin.
If the LDC econoimj is underemployed, however, the change in exports need

not crowd out otherwise production (or leisure) of equal value. Indeed, if the 1DC
governments are other unable to stimulate their under—employed economies, and if
the value of leisure is zero, then each $1 increase in export volumes might
reflect a net increase of even more than $1 in welfare.

These considerations suggest a modified welfare measures such as

di

di =

+

8ALd(C+C+C).

Here 0 represents the fraction at which the rise in

export volumes is evaluated. We plan to explore measures such as di in further
work.

V.

The Gains to

a

Coordinated Response to

In this section we use

the

the

Shock

model to assess the potential gains to

coordinating policies between the US and OECD in response to an OPEC price shock

of the magnitude experienced in 1919. The model was recalibrated using data on

trade shares and asset stocks for 1919. These new trade and asset matrices are
given in Tables 20 and 21. Note that the ratio of OECD to US GDP is 1.88 in
1919 compared with 1.39 for 1983. Most of this difference is due to valuation
effects of an appreciating dollar.

We assume that the U.S. inherits an inflation rate of 9.8% and the OECD

inherits an inflation rate of 8%. The model is shocked with a rise in the price
of OPEC exports of 914% in 1919 (this is the change in the real U.S. price of

—56—

Saudi

Oil between 1919(1) and 1980(1) given in TFS

Statistics).

The Objective

of the US and OECD governments is to reduce inflation and the output gap to zero
as set out in the section III.
In Tables 22 and 23 we compare the non—cooperative and cooperative

equilibria. Of course, these comparisons depend on a particular assumed utility
function in each country, and so they are not, strictly speaking, historical

simulations. In fact, the utility functions are probably a bit too
anti—inflationary in their implications to mimic the actual policies that were

undertaken. Nonetheless, we believe that the results give at least an order of
magnitude of the results to be achieved through more active policy coordination.

Notice

that in this section all results are in constant $1919.

As we found above, the optimal policy mix in both regions in response to an
inflationary impulse is a sharp monetary contraction and a fiscal expansion to
offset the output decline. The policy mix for the U.S. is shown in Figure 14•

MU is cut by 18% in 1919 followed by a return to faster monetary growth by 1981.
Fiscal policy is extremely expansionary with the deficit rising by 7.5% of GDP.
The mix in the OECIJ is less extreme with a monetary contraction of 15% and a

fiscal expansion of 3.5% of OECD GDP (or 6.3% of US GDP). Given the assumed
parameters the dollar exchange rate appreciates 11% in 1979. The U.S. nominal
interest rate rises to 25.8% in 1979 (short—term rates in fact rose above
20 percent in 1980 in the U.S. but not to 25%).
Under a regime of cooperation, with the U.S. and OECD receiving equal
weight in overall utility, both the U.S. and the OECD reach higher levels of
interteniporal utility. In Figure 5 we show the optimal paths of U.S. monetary

and fiscal policy. The monetary contraction in the U.S. is cut by a third of
what it was under non—cooperation. Also the fiscal expansion is now only 2.2%

of U.S. GDP compared to 1.5% under noncooperation. Nominal interest rates in
the U.S. rise to 19.2% which is still a large rise but more than 6% less than under
non—cooperation. The dollar appreciation is also reduced to 9.5%.
Again we find a large gain for the LDCs from the move to cooperation

between the US and OECD. Cooperation reduces the loss in LDC real imports by i%
although it worsens the LDC terms of trade. The big gain for the LDCs is again
through the effects of lower interest rates and a less appreciated dollar on

debt repayments. in 1979 alone, cooperation would save the LDCs $9.3b in
interest repayments. The utility calculations that we developed in section IV

can again be used to measure the overall gain for the LDCs. Consider the
measure of gain to cooperation given in Table 2)4:

VI.

Impact of a Change in the U.S Fiscal/Monetary Mix

In

this section we examine the implications of a shift in U.S. policy

towards smaller fiscal deficits and more expansionary monetary policy

commencing in l984. We consider two cases. The first is a sustained cut in
U.S. fiscal deficits of 2% of U.S GDP per year brought about by a cut in real

spending. MU is increased by a sustained i.i% to offset the contractionary

effect of the fiscal stance on real output (in the first year). The second
simulation is a gradual reduction of fiscal deficits of 1% of US. GDP in l98iL

and 2% in 1985 brought about by a cut in spending. We again choose a path for
monetary policy which offsets the initial impact of the fiscal policy on real

output. All results are presented as deviation from our assumed base path.

Sustained Change in the U.S. Fiscal Monetary Mix
The results for the sustained 2% (of U.S. GDP) cut in U.S. fiscal deficits

accompanied by a relaxation of monetary policy are shown in Table 25. These
results are presented as deviations from a baseline simulation. Our
approximation for monetary accomodation is simply a one step rise in the path of
MU, that approximately offsets the fiscal contraction in the first year.

U.S. GDP rises slightly in i98 but declines in subsequent periods because
monetary policy is not sufficiently expansionary in later years to offset the

contraction induced by fiscal policy. The change in policy mix has the expected
effect on the US interest rate, which falls by 1.8 percentage points in 198)4 and

continues to fall thereafter. By 1990 the reduction is 2.9% in the nominal
interest rate and 2.5% in the real rate. The U.S. current account improves by
$31.3b in 198)4 and remains improved. The U.S. dollar depreciates by 8.1% in

198)4 and stays weaker than in the base simulation. Because of the dollar
depreciation, inflation rises by a half percentage point in 198)4 and 1985.

Consider the impact on the rest of the world. As expected the U.S. policy
has a beggar thy neighbour impact on the OECD. OECD GDP falls by 1.8% in 198)4

due to the appreciation of the ECU. The OECD recession is short—lived though,
as falling world interest rates stimulate OECD domestic demand. OECD inflation
is also reduced by .14% in 198)4. From 1986 the OECD is in a position of lower

inflation and higher output than under the base path.

The gains to the LDCs are more immediate. The depreciation of the dollar
and lower interest rates reduces the burden of the debt. This is offset by a
deterioration in the terms of trade due to the initial contraction in OECD

demand for LDC goods. In Table 26 we calculate the gain in LDC utility using
the technique discussed in section IV.

As this table illustrates the LDC gains increase over time as interest rates

continue to fall and the LDC terms of trade improve. Thus, even though the U.S.
GDP growth is reduced, the LDCs benefit according to our welfare criteria.

Gradual change in the US Fiscal/Monetary Mix
The second U.S. policy switch that we consider consists of a 1% (of U.S.

GDP) reduction in

the

real fiscal deficit in

l98

and a 2% cut from 1985 onwards

(with a corresponding cut in real spending). We also assume a monetary path

which dampens the contractionary effect of fiscal policy on real output. In
this case we assume no change in MU relative to baseline in l984 and a rise of

2%, 3%, 5.3%. 6.1%. 6.8% and

.0% with 1% maintained relative to baseline in all

subsequent years from 1990. The results are shown in Table 27.
It is interesting to note that despite the fiscal cut and no change in
monetary policy in 198)4, U.S. GDP rises in 198)4. This is the result of the

forward looking behaviour in the model. Agents are aware of the future fiscal
contraction and monetary expansion. The future exchange rate depreciation is
brought into the present by a shift out of dollars into ECU in anticipation of

the depreciation of the dollar. The effect of the large U.S. depreciation on
stimulating foreign demand for U.S. goods is larger than the direct effect of

the fiscal contraction. This seems to occur because part of the exchange rate
change reflects anticipated spending changes which do not appear until 1985.

larger depreciation is reflected in higher U.S. inflation. Interest rates
also rise by .6% initially due to the increase in inflation, but quickly decline

The

from 1985 as the anticipated fiscal cut occurs. The U.S. current account
improves in 198)4 and continues to improve. The initial gain in U.S. GDP from
the higher exchange rate depeciation is reflected in a larger initial loss in

OECD GDP. Again it is only 2 years before OECD GDP has returned to its base
path level.

In

this case, the LDC terms of trade deterioration exceeds the interest

rate effect in the first year of the policy change, so that LDC welfare in 198)4

actually falls. However, from 1985 onward, the large benefits from lower U.S.
interest rates are then realized. The calculations of LDC welfare are presented
in Table 28.

As can be seen from the results of this section the effects of the change
in U.S. fiscal/monetary mix depend importantly on the timing of the policy

changes. An anticipated reduction in future fiscal deficits can initially
reduce OECD and LDC welfare through the effect on the current exchange rate.
However, the gains to the LDCs from lower world interest rates emerge quickly.

VII. Conclusion
We have produced a small—scale model of LDC—OECD macroeconomic
interactions, that highlights the importance of OECD macroeconomic policies for

the external trade and financing of developing countries. The model allows us
to distinguish the effects of monetary versus fiscal policies, as well as

—67—

policies in the U.S. versus the rest of the OECD, The key stock—flow
relationships are carefully observed, and expectations in the asset markets are
rational.

Given the objectives of macroeconomic policy that we specify, we highlight
an aspect of the gains to coordinating policies between the U.S. and the rest of

the OECD not previously remarked upon. That is the substantial gains to the
less developed countries which can emerge from coordination among the developed

countries. We have shown that in inflationary periods, non—cooperative policies
in the developed countries lead to high world interest rates which may be
reduced, to the benefit of the LDCs, by successful coordination.
The analysis in this paper can be usefully extended in several directions.
In future work we plan to estimate more of the structural equations although we
feel that the parameters we choose in this paper represent a broad consensus of

other econometric results. It is also important to examine the sensitivity of

the results to changes in these parameters. Another useful extension would be
to model the internal structure of the LDCs and to get a measure of the welfare
effects of various policies for individual countries within the LDCs. The

welfare measure that we developed in this paper could be modified to allow for
the presence of unemployed factors in the LDCs.

Policy Multipliers from the DRI, MCM and EPA Models

Tables Al—A9 outline the multipliers for monetary and fiscal policy in the

DPI (Data Resources, Inc.), MCM

(Federal Reserve Board Multicountry) and EPA

(Japanese Economic Planning Agency) models. These provide a useful benchmark
for comparison with the multipliers presented in Tables 12 and 13 in the text.

1.

Fiscal Multipliers

The multipliers for fiscal policy are shown in Tables Al to A4. The impact
multipliers for GNP in these ndels range from 1.2 to 2.0 with the three year
average multiplier ranging from .83 to 1.9. These compare with an impact
multiplier of .8 and a three year average multiplier of .8i in our model. The
smaller multiplier we find is not surprising given the importance of portfolio

adjustments and greater flexibility of the exchange rate in our model. The
exchange rate appreciation of 3.5% in our model is substantially greater than in
the larger models and is partly reflected in a larger decline in the U.S.

current account. The responses of other variables to a fiscal expansion are
broadly consistent with those found in the larger models.

2.

Monetary Multipliers

The monetary policy multipliers are outlined in Tables A5—A9. A monetary
stimulus has a smaller impact effect on GNP in the larger models than we find.
These is also a wide divergence of results in the larger models for the monetary

—69—

shocks although the shocks are only approximately consistent across models. In
DEl

a monetary stimulus changes GNP by twice the amount found in the MOM and EPA

models, with impact multipliers of .8, .3, and .L respectively compared with 1.1
in our model. The three year average multipliers for GNP are . in EPA, .8 in
DEl and .6 in MCM

which compares with .7 in our model. A monetary expansion

(contraction) also stimulates (dampens) GNP for a longer period in the larger
models with interest rates remaining below (above) the base path for a longer
period.
