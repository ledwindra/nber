    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper contrasts direct election with political appointment of regulators.  When regulators are appointed, regulatory policy becomes bundled with other policy issues the appointing politicians are responsible for.  Since regulatory issues are not salient for most voters, regulatory policy outcomes reflect the preferences of party elites and special interests.  Direct election of regulators strengthens the power of voters by ensuring the salience of regulatory issues.  Using panel data on regulatory outcomes from U.S. states, we find evidence in favor of the idea that elected states are more pro-consumer in their regulatory policies.\n\n",
