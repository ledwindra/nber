I. Introduction
In recent years, a substantial body of research has focused on the question of how
environmental policy should be set in an economy with pre-existing distortionary taxes, a
question with significant policy importance. A number of previous papers have shown that
interactions with pre-existing taxes raise the cost of environmental taxes. However, these
papers did not account for impacts of changes in environmental quality on individual health.
A recent paper by Schwartz and Repetto (2000) argues that, when health effects are
accounted for, the optimal environmental tax may exceed the marginal damage from
pollution. The present paper demonstrates that this is not the case.
Previous papers have pointed out two contrasting effects on the costs of
environmental taxes in the presence of pre-existing distortionary taxes. Some early papers1
suggested that the cost of a pollution tax could be lower in such a context, because pollution
tax revenue could replace revenue from distortionary taxes such as the income tax, and thus
produce a welfare gain. This effect has come to be known as the revenue-recycling effect.
More recent papers2 demonstrated the existence of a second general-equilibrium
effect, the tax-interaction effect, which works in the opposite direction. Pollution taxes drive
up the price of consumption goods, thus lowering the real wage and discouraging labor
supply. This exacerbates the tax distortion in the labor market, creating an efficiency loss.
Thus, the tax-interaction effect tends to raise to costs of environmental taxes. These papers
also show that this loss is larger than the gain from the revenue-recycling effect, because the
pollution tax has a narrower base than the labor tax, and thus is less efficient at raising
revenue. Consequently, in an economy with pre-existing distortionary taxes, the optimal
pollution tax is typically lower than in an economy without such pre-existing taxes.
Schwartz and Repetto (2000) question this conclusion. They cite a large body of
evidence suggesting that a significant portion of the cost of pollution comes in the form of
damages to human health, and that such health damages tend to reduce labor supply. This

evidence is used to justify assuming a preference structure in which leisure and environmental
quality are substitutes, whereas the prior literature had assumed that environmental quality is
separable in utility. Their paper then shows that when environmental quality is a leisure
substitute, the optimal pollution tax will be higher than previous studies have indicated, and
that it could easily exceed the level of marginal damages.
The present paper reexamines the implications of health effects from pollution.
Rather than simply assuming a preference relationship, as in Schwartz and Repetto, it uses a
model with an explicit representation of the ways in which health damages from pollution
affect labor supply.3 In this model, health damage from pollution may affect labor supply
through two distinct channels–by increasing spending on medical care, and/or by causing
individuals to spend time sick, thus reducing the time they have available for labor or leisure.
The model confirms that health effects do indeed affect labor supply, and that this
results in an additional impact, here termed the benefit-side tax-interaction effect. However,
counter to Schwartz and Repetto’s results, the model demonstrates that this effect cannot
cause the optimal pollution tax to exceed marginal damages. In fact, it shows that, for typical
parameter values, this effect will cause the optimal pollution tax to be even lower than that
indicated by previous studies which assumed separability.
To the extent that health damage from pollution causes households to spend more on
medical care, the benefits from reduced pollution are diminished by the benefit-side taxinteraction effect. Thus, the optimal pollution tax will be less than previous studies have
indicated, and will be substantially below the marginal damage from pollution.
In contrast, to the extent that pollution causes increased time lost to illness, the sign of
the benefit-side tax-interaction effect will be ambiguous, though for typical parameter values,
this effect will diminish the benefits of regulation. Furthermore, even if parameter values are
such that this effect does increase the benefits of regulation, the optimal pollution tax will still
be unambiguously less than marginal damages. These results differ sharply from Schwartz

3

This model and the analysis presented here draw heavily on Williams (2000), which analyzes the
implications of health and productivity effects on second-best environmental taxation.

2

and Repetto’s conclusions, demonstrating the value of modeling such effects explicitly rather
than assuming a preference relationship.
The next section of the paper presents an analytically tractable general-equilibrium
model that explicitly models health damages from pollution, and derives expressions for the
welfare effect from and optimal level of a pollution tax. The final section summarizes and
concludes.

II. The Model
A representative agent model is assumed, where households divide their time
endowment (T) between leisure (l) and labor (L), which is used to produce the two
consumption goods, X and Y. Households divide their income between consumption of X
and Y in order to maximize the utility function
(1)

U( V( l, X, Y ), H, G)

which is continuous and quasi-concave. G is the quantity of a public good, and H represents
consumer health.
X, Y, G, and medical care (M) are all produced using labor as the only factor of
production. All production is assumed to follow constant returns to scale, and units are
normalized such that one unit of labor can produce one unit of any of the four goods.
(2)

L = X+Y + M +G
Pollution from consumption of good X reduces environmental quality. Good Y is

nonpolluting. Environmental quality is simply equal to an exogenous baseline level minus
emissions, with units normalized such that the production and consumption of one unit of X
results in one unit of emissions:
(3)

Q = Q− X
Pollution has two effects. First, consumer health depends on environmental quality

and the level of medical care consumed.
(4)

H = H ( M, Q)

It is assumed that ∂H ∂M > 0 , ∂H ∂Q > 0 , ∂ 2 H ∂M 2 < 0 , and ∂ 2 H ∂M∂Q < 0 .

3

Second, pollution causes households to lose some time to sickness, thus reducing the
time they have available for work or leisure. This implies the following household time
constraint
(5)

L + l = T − S (Q)

where S(Q) represents time spent sick, which is decreasing in Q.
The government levies a corrective tax on good X, and also imposes a tax on labor
income. We normalize the gross wage to equal one, which yields the consumer budget
constraint
(6)

(1 −τ ) L + I = (1+ τ )X + Y + M
L

X

where I is lump-sum income, which is assumed to be zero.4
Revenue from the two taxes is used to finance provision of the public good. 5 For
simplicity, we assume that the level of the public good is fixed.6
(7)

G = τL L + τXX
Households maximize utility (1) subject to their time constraint (5) and budget

constraint (6), taking the quantity of the public good, the tax rates, and the level of
environmental quality as given. This yields the first order conditions:
(8)

UV VX = (1 + τ X ) λ ; UV VY = λ ; UV Vl = (1− τ L ) λ ; UH

∂H
=λ
∂M

where λ represents the marginal utility of income.
These first-order conditions, together with the other equations given thus far,
implicitly define the uncompensated demand functions:
(9)

X( τ X ,τ L , Q, I ) ; Y (τ X ,τ L , Q, I ) ; l( τ X , τ L , Q, I ) ; M( τ X , τ L , Q, I )

4

The reader may wonder why the budget constraint includes I , given that households do not have any
lump-sum income. This is necessary in order to provide a rigorous expression for income effects later in
the paper.
5

If government revenue were instead used to provide a fixed lump-sum transfer to households, as in
Schwartz and Repetto (2000), the model’s results would be unchanged, as long as the value of the transfer is
held constant in real terms.
6

Assuming instead that the government provides the optimal level of the public good would substantially
complicate the analysis. The paper’s results, however, would be qualitatively the same.

This is the marginal cost of public funds (MCPF), or the cost to the household of
raising one dollar of government revenue through the labor tax. The numerator in the first
term is the marginal deadweight loss in the labor market, while the denominator is the
marginal revenue from a change in the tax rate. The cost to households is the deadweight
loss plus the revenue; hence the MCPF is this first term plus one. This is a partial equilibrium
definition of the MCPF; it ignores the effects of the labor tax on deadweight loss in the
market for good X, revenue from the corrective tax, and environmental quality. We will
assume that labor supply is not backward-bending and that marginal revenue from the labor
tax is positive, which together imply that η >1 .

This expression decomposes the welfare effect into four components: the primary

welfare effect, (dW P ), the revenue-recycling effect, (dW R ), the (cost-side) tax-interaction effect
( dW I ), and the benefit-side tax-interaction effect ( dW IB ). The primary welfare effect is the
effect of the tax on the pollution externality, equal to the wedge between the social cost of
emissions (the Pigouvian tax) and the private cost (the tax on good X). The revenuerecycling effect is the efficiency gain from using pollution tax revenue to reduce the labor
tax rate, which equals the marginal cost of public funds minus one times the marginal
pollution tax revenue.
Finally, two tax-interaction effects result when the pollution tax alters households’
labor supply decisions, thus altering the welfare loss from the income tax distortion in the
labor market.7 The cost-side tax-interaction effect dW I , which is by now well-known from
the prior literature, results when the pollution tax drives up the costs of producing consumer
goods, lowering the real wage and discouraging labor supply. The benefit-side taxinteraction effect dW IB expresses the impact of improved environmental quality on labor
supply decisions.

7

Schwartz and Repetto (2000) treated these two effects together, but this paper will treat them separately.

6

Each of the two tax-interaction effects is equal to the distortionary wedge in the labor
market (the income tax) times the change in leisure. Added to this is the gain or loss from
changes in labor tax revenue, equal to the change in tax revenue times the marginal cost of
public funds minus one. Summing those elements for the effect of the pollution tax on
consumer good prices gives the third term in (22), and a similar sum for the change resulting
from improved environmental quality gives the fourth term.
The prior literature (Parry (1995), for example) has shown that the cost of
environmental regulation depends on the degree of substitutability between the polluting
good and leisure. For simplicity, we consider the neutral assumption that good X is an
average substitute for leisure. Given this assumption, the cost-side tax-interaction effect can
be expressed (see appendix for derivation) as
(17)

dW I = −( η −1 ) X
The benefit-side tax-interaction effect can be expressed (see appendix for derivation) as

where εLI is the income elasticity of labor supply and εL is the uncompensated labor supply
elasticity. Examining this expression shows that if an improved environment results in lower
spending on medical care, the benefit-side tax-interaction effect will reduce the benefit of
regulation. In this case, environmental quality is a substitute for a private good (medical
care), and thus increased environmental quality increases leisure consumption, causing a
general-equilibrium welfare loss.
In contrast, if an improved environment results in less time lost to illness, then the sign
of the benefit-side tax-interaction effect is ambiguous. Reducing time lost to illness increases
both leisure demand and labor supply. The first term in brackets is the welfare gain that
results because the increased labor supply boosts labor tax revenue. However, there is an
offsetting welfare loss (part of the second term in brackets) because increased leisure demand

7

exacerbates the labor market distortion. Therefore, the sign of the total effect is ambiguous,
and depends on tax rates and elasticities.8

The first term on the right-hand side of this equation–the Pigouvian tax rate divided
by the marginal cost of public funds–is the optimal environmental tax rate found by previous
studies which assume that environmental quality is separable in utility. The second term
represents the effect of benefit-side tax interactions.
Is it possible that the optimal pollution tax exceed the Pigouvian tax rate? For this to
be the case, the term in brackets must exceed the Pigouvian tax rate. Inspection reveals that
this is impossible. The second term in brackets is negative, and the first term is at most equal
to the labor tax rate times the Pigouvian tax rate. Thus, Schwartz and Repetto’s claim–that
health effects may cause the optimal tax rate to exceed the Pigouvian level–is invalid.
But is the optimal pollution tax above the level suggested by most other prior work,
which assumed that environmental quality is separable in utility. For this to be the case, the
term in brackets must be positive. Assuming that the labor tax rate is 0.4, the uncompensated
labor supply elasticity is 0.15, the income elasticity of labor supply is −0.15, and that medical

8

Schwartz and Repetto (2000) correctly noted that if pollution causes households to spend time sick,
improvements in environmental quality will increase labor supply. However, contrary to their conclusion,
this does not necessarily mean that there will be a gain from the benefit-side tax-interaction effect. It is
easy to see the source of their error. In a model in which the total time available for labor and leisure is
fixed–as in Schwartz and Repetto’s study–an increase in labor supply requires a decrease in leisure
consumption. Explicitly modeling this health impact, however, shows that both labor and leisure will
increase in response to reduced pollution, and thus that the sign of the welfare impact is ambiguous.

8

spending is not an inferior good9 implies that it is negative. Thus, if either type of health
effect is present, the optimal tax will actually be lower than in a model in which environmental
quality is separable in utility.

III. Conclusions
This paper has shown that when improved environmental quality reduces spending on
medical care, the optimal environmental tax will be lower than indicated by models in which
environmental quality is separable from goods and leisure in the utility function. A similar
result will hold for typical parameter values when environmental quality affects time lost to
illness, though it is possible for the optimal environmental tax to be higher if income effects
on labor supply are quite small. In either case, the optimal environmental tax will be below
the value of marginal damages from pollution.
These results run counter to those found by Schwartz and Repetto (2000). This
demonstrates the value of explicitly modeling health effects, rather than assuming a
preference relationship, and reinforces the general notion that pre-existing distortionary taxes
tend to raise the costs of environmental taxes.

9

These labor elasticities are roughly consistent with those found by Fuchs, Krueger, and Poterba (1998) in
a survey of labor economists. A labor tax rate of 0.4 is a standard assumption in the literature; see, for
example, Browning (1987).

Appendix
Derivation of Equation (17)
The expression for the (cost-side) tax-interaction effect from equation (16) is:
(A1)

dW I = −ητ L

∂l
∂τ X

Because the change in the price of good X is equal to the change in the tax rate, the Slutsky equation
gives
(A2)

∂l
∂l C ∂l
=
− X
∂τ X ∂τ X ∂I

where the superscript “C” denotes a compensated derivative.
Similarly,
(A3)

∂l
∂l C ∂l
=
− L
∂τ L ∂τ L ∂I

Taking a derivative of the household utility function (1), holding the levels of utility and of
environmental quality constant and substituting in the consumer first-order conditions (11) yield

The assumption that the cross-elasticity between X and leisure is equal to the average (weighted by
consumption share) over all goods can be written as
(A5)


∂X C 1 − τ L

∂X C 1 −τ L
∂Y C 1 −τ L
∂M C 1 −τ L 
 (1 +τ X ) X

∂ (1 − τ L ) X
∂ (1 −τ L ) X
∂ (1− τ L ) Y
∂ (1 −τ L ) M 
(1 + τ X )X + Y + M 

Substituting (A5) and the household budget constraint (6) into (A4) yields
(A6)

∂l C
∂X C L
=
∂τ L ∂ (1 − τ L ) X

Finally, the Slutsky symmetry property gives
(A7)

∂lC
∂X C
=
∂τ X ∂ (1 −τ L )

Substituting (A2), (A3), (A6), (A7) and the definition of η (15) into (A1) yields equation (17).

The change in spending on X, Y, and l for a change in I will equal

For a change in Q that change will be

Weak separability of health in the utility function implies that leisure demand is determined
solely by the relative prices of l, X, and Y (which are not affected by changes in Q) and by the amount
spent on those goods. Together with (A9) and (A10), this implies

The uncompensated labor supply elasticity is
(A12) ε L =

∂L 1− τ L
∂l 1− τ L
=
∂ (1− τ L ) L

and the income elasticity of labor supply is
(A13) ε LI =

Substituting expressions (A11) through (A13) and the definition of the MCPF (15) into (A8)
and rearranging yields equation (18)
