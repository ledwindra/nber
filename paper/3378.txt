             PRICE INDEXES FOR MICROCOMPUTERS: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY


                                    ABSTRACT

     In this paper we focus on alternative procedures for calculating and
interpreting quality-adjusted price indexes for microcomputers, based on a
variety of estimated hedonic price equations. Our data set comprises an
unbalanced panel for 1265 model observations from 1982 to 1988, and includes
both list and discount prices. We develop and implement empirically a
specification test for selecting preferable hedonic price equations, and
consider in detail the alternative interpretations of dununy variable
coefficients having time and age, vintage and age, and all of the time, age,
and vintage dummy variables as regressors.

     We then calculate a variety of quality-adjusted price indexes; for the
Divisja indexes we employ estimated hedonic price equations to predict
prices of unobserved models (pre-entry and post-exit). Although our indexes
show a modest amount of variation, we find that on average over the 1982-88
time period in the US, quality-adjusted real prices for microcomputers
decline at about 28% per year.

I. INTRODUCTION

      In recent years, a considerable amount of research has focussed on the

construction snd interpretation of price indexes for computers) The computer

market is a fascinating one, for technological change has been rapid, there

has been a great deal of entry and exit of fins and models, and particularly

in the microcomputer market, models have been simultaneously sold at different

prices by standard retail and discount vendors.

      Because of the rapid technological change and turnover of models and

fins, Franklin M. Fisher et al. [1983] have characterized the mainframe

computer market as typically being in "disequilibrium". One consequence of

this is that price indexes have been used for two rather different purposes.

one to deflate expenditures or purchases into constant dollars, and the other

to trace out movements in a technological frontier, such as a price-

performance ratio.

      If quality-adjusted prices reacted instantaneously and fully to the

introduction of new technology, then an index that traced out the

technological frontier would be identical to one that covered all models sold

in the marketplace. In periods of disequilibrium, however, the two quality-

adjusted price indexes might differ, with consumers tolerating transactions at

more than one quality-adjusted price. Reasons for such multiple price

transactions include the fact that the supply of some new models might

initially be limited, and that in spite of this excess demand, manufacturers

may offer new models at lower prices to facilitate dissemination of

information about the impact of the new low-price technology. Alternatively,

surviving models may be of higher quality in some unobserved characteristics,

 or   may benefit from the accumulation of specialized software and knowhow. The

 extent of such price disequilibrium is of course an empirical issue; some

 recent evidence on this issue for the mainframe computer market is presented

by Ellen Oulberger [1989].

        Although the mainframe computer market has received considerable

attention, to the best of our knowledge there has been little empirical work

on the microcomputer or PC market.2 In this paper we focus attention on the

interpretation of implicit price indexes and coefficients from hedonic price

equations using detailed data from the retail and discount US microcomputer

(PC) markets.3 Our work builds on the research of two of our students, Jeremy

Cohen [1988] and Amy Kim [1989]. Cohen originally gathered and assembled

price and characteristics data covering the 1976-1987 time period; the data he

updated to include 1988 were then examined further by Kim.

        Eased on hedonic regression equations with pooled data, both Cohen and

Kim generated implicit PC price indexes for retail (list) and discount

markets. Representative findings from Cohen and Kim are presented in Table 1

below, as are the PC price indexes computed by Robert J. Gdrdon [1990] based

on 21 PC model-years and the "matched model" index number procedure, and the

BEA "official" PC price index.4

        As is seen in Table 1, all indexes suggest rapid declines in the

quality-adjusted price of microcomputers. Cohen reports an average annual

growth rate (AACR) of -25.36% in the Ai (CPI adjusted) price of PC's over

the 1976-87 time frame for list prices, and a slightly lower -21.33% for

discount prices. Kim finds an AACR of -29.48% for reel list prices 1976-88,

and -23.53% for real discount prices. Gordon's calculations suggest an AACR

Notes: Data are taken from Cohen [1988], Appendix D, p. 70 (reriormalized to
1982 — 1.000); from Kim [1989], Appendix 22; and from Cordon [1990], Table
6.13, p. 237 (renormalized). The BEA Index is from the November 1988 issue
of the Survey of Current Business. Gordon's index is based on data covering
21 model-years observed over the 1981-87 time period in advertisements in
Business Week and PC Magazine. The real price indexes are computed as the
nominal price index divided by the Consumer Price Index (the CPI is in the
last column).




of -26.12% for the shorter 1982-87 time period (a mix of list and discount

prices), while the SEA real price index falls at an AAGR of -25.08% for the

same time period.

       To facilitate comparison of indexes, in the bottom row of Table 1 we

present AACR for all the real and nominal price indexes over the same 1982-87

time interval. Note that the BEA and Gordon price indexes based on matched

model procedures show a less rapid decline over this interval than do the

hedonic regression indexes constructed by Cohen and Kim.

      The research results we report in this paper extend the work of Cohen

Kim and Gordon in a number of related ways. First, we focus attention on the

more general interpretive implications of the fact that the PC market is a

changing one during the 1982-88 time period, involving shake-outs of some

models, successful innovations for others, and dramatic changes in product

characteristics. The data sample we observe is opportunistic in the sense

that it represents only new and surviving vintages. We examine whether

surviving vintages are priced at a premium, and how prices of surviving

vintages adjust when new models are introduced incorporating technological

advances.

      Second, we examine several econometric implications of the fact that our

data are in the form of an unbalanced panel, due to differential survival

rates in the marketplace. In particular, we explore implications for

estimation of how one implements empirically the identity that the year in

which the model is observed is the sum of the year in which the model was

first introduced and its age in years. A diagnostic test is discussed and

implemented for checking our hedonic specification. Issues of sample

selectivity are also addressed.

      Finally, we construct and comment on a variety of price indexes that

attempt in various ways to serve as deflators, or as measures that trace out a

technological frontier in the PC market.



II. THE DATA

     The data set available for this study includes price and technical

attribute measures for new (not used) personal computers sold in the US from

1976 to 1988. The 1976-1987 data were originally collected and analyzed by
                      MICROCOMPUTER PRICES            Page 5

Jeremy Cohen [1988]; these data have been updated by Cohen to 1988, they have

been employed by Amy Kim [1989] in further analysis, and have undergone

additional revisions by us. The primary source of technical data was the

magazine comprehensive technical reviews. Since both list and discount prices

often varied within each calendar year, the June issues of          PC Magazine,

and PC World were employed for list price data, while ads in the Science and

Technology, and Business Sections of a Sunday New York Times issue in early

June of each year were employed to obtain discount prices.5 Additional data

sources included the Dataauest Personal Comouter Guide, and IBM pricing and

technical data.

         Characteristic and performance data collected by Cohen include RAM (the

amount of random access memory standard on each PC model, measured in

kilobytes), MHZ (the clock speed, measured in megahertz, or millions of cycles

per second), HRDDSK (the amount of storage on the hard disk, if one exists,

measured in megabytes), NUMFLP (the number of floppy disk drives standard on

each model), SLOTS (the total number of eight, sixteen and thirty-two bit

slots available for expansion boards), and ACE (the number of years the model

has been sold on the market, where the model has an age of zero in its initial

year).

         As we noted earlier, an important feature of the PC market is that it is

changing very rapidly. A model introduced in year zero may survive with

unchanged characteristics into year one, two, or even longer, or, as is often

the case, it may survive with differing characteristics into other years (we

call this a changed version of the model). Other models may exit after being

in the market only one year. Hence the stock of models sold in any given year

consists of new and incumbent models, and among the incumbent models, new and

old versions.

      To highlight the evolution of the PC market, in Table 2 we present

arithmetic means of characteristics for models newly introduced from 1982

through 1988. As is seen there, the mean nominal price decreased slightly,

about 3% from $3617.61 in 1982 to $3508.47 in 1988, while mean RAM increased

more than tenfold from 94.92 to 1069.39 1(8, MHZ clock speed jumped more than

three times from 4.4046 to 14.8201, and the mean hard disk storage rose from 0

to 43.638 MB.

      the text.




      Although newly introduced models constitute a major portion of our PC data

base (722 of the 1265 models are new), some models last several years, and of

these incumbent models, some evolve into different versions with altered

characteristics. Other models exit, leaving the marketplace after less than one

year. In Table 3 we summarize the mixed nature of the PC market from 1982 to

1988, including new and up to age 3 models, separately for the total, retail and

discount markets. For the total market, 58X (722 of 1265) are new models, 29%

(372) models survived one year (perhaps with changed characteristics and reduced

prices to meet the market competition from frontier models), 10% (129) survived

two   years,   and 3% (42) remained in the market place for three years.

      Altogether,    about 72% of our model observations are taken from the retail

 (list price) market, while 28% represent discount (much of it mail order)

quotations.6 However, as is also seen in Table 3, the age composition of models

varies considerably between the retail and discount markets. Specifically,

discount markets tend to have a much smaller proportion of new models, and much

larger proportions of age 1, 2 and 3 year-old models. Finally, it is worth

noting that in our data set, some models are sold in both the retail and discount

markets (e.g. ,   IBM and Compaq) and are therefore "observed" twice, while others

are only in the retail market (e.g., PC Limited); however, no model ia observed

only in the discount market.

      To focus attention on issues involved in interpreting coefficients with

unbalanced panels, in this paper we adopt in essence the regressors and

functional form employed by Cohen and Kim, in which the logarithm of the real

price (1.RPRICE) is regressed on the logarithm of aeveral characteristica

including LRAM, LXHZ, LHRDDSK (log (HRDDSK +    1)),   LNIJMFLP (log(NUMFLP +   U),
LSLOTS (log(SLOTS +   U),   and a number of dummy variablea.

      The dummy variables for characteristics include PROC16 (—1 if model has a

16-bit processor chip, else zero), PROC32 (—1 if model has a 32-bit proceasor

chip), DBW (—1 if system comes with a monochrome monitor), DCOLOR (—1 if system

comes with a color monitor), DPORT (—1 if model is portable or convertible),

DEXTRA (—1 if model haa a significant piece of additional hardware included, else

zero. Examples of such extra hardware include modema, printers or an extra

monitor), and DDISC (—1 if system price is discounted by the vendor).

      The dummy variables for manufacturers are DIBM (—1 if system is made by

IBM), DAPPLE (Apple), DCOMMO (Commodore), DCMPQ (Compaq), DNEC (NEC), DRDIOSH

(Radio Shack), DPCLIM (PC Limited), and DOTHER (made or sold by any other company

than those noted above).

       Finally,   a number of time and vintage effect dummy variables are employed.

For time effects, the dummy variables T82, T83          188, take on the value of one

if the PC model was sold in that year, and else equal zero. For vintage effects,

the dummy variables V79, V80        V88 take on the value one if the model was

originally introduced in that year, and else equal zero.

      The above variables, as well as several other measures, were included as

regressors in a number of specifications examined by Cohen and by Kim using data

beginning in 1976.     Since the PC market was very small from 1976 until the entry

of IBM in late 1981 (only 156 models were introduced before 1982), in this paper

we confine our attention to the 1982-1988 time period and the 1979-88 vintages,

restricting our sample to PC models whose age is three years or less, and

dividing the ACE variable into three dummy variables, ACE1, ACE2 and AGE3, with a

new model having an implicit age of zero. The data used in our regression

analysis is summarized in Table 4, where we present sample means as well as

minimum and maximum values of the various variables.



III. ECONOMETRIC ISSUES

      Our data set comes in the form of an unbalanced panel, in that the number

of observations by age, and by vintage, varies by year. Let the vintage of model

i (the year in which it was first introduced) be V, where V — V79,V8O          V88,

let the year (time period) in which the model is observed be T, where T — 182,

183     188, and let the age of the model of vintage V observed in time period T,

in years, be A, where A — AO,Al,A2 and A3. This yields the identity that for any

model -observation,

                   TIME—VINTAGE+ACE, or T—V+A.                                   (1)

      If T, V and A were continuous variables indexed by year, one could not

simultaneously introduce all three as regressors in a linear equation to be

estimated by least squares, for exact collinearity would result; to avoid such

collinearity, only two of the three could be included directly, and estimates for

the third could be computed indirectly using (1). Alternatively, as has been

discussed by Stephen Fienberg and William Mason [1985] ,      one could specify a model
                    MICROCOMPUTER PRICES                 -
                                                             Page 11 -

with   nonlinear transformations of all three variables, such as their squared

values.7

       However, when T, V and A are discrete dummy variables rather than

continuous, and if the coefficients of these variables are to be held Constant

over time and/or vintage, then the simple adding-up conditions implied by (1) no

longer hold. This raises a number of issues involving the interpretation of

dummy variable coefficients, and the maximal parameterization possible that

avoids exact collinearity.8

        Suppose one specified an equation having, in addition to an overall

constant and a number of model i-specific characteristic variables (called X's),

the time and age dummy variables (but not the vintage dummies),

              In ivat — a +   T'a + A'aa +   X'fl   +   uivat,                (2)

where the T82 and AO dummy variables were deleted. In this case one might

interpret estimates of the at as changes in the quality-adjusted price index

relative to 1982, holding age fixed. Similarly, estimates of the 0a can be

interpreted as the effects of age (relative to a new model of age zero) on price,

holding time fixed. Intuitively, the at parameters in this T-A specification

represent the general movement in average PC prices, given the average rate at

which selectivity occurs in the sample.

       While cumulated evidence from the mainframe market suggests that the at

should decline with time,9 it is not clear what one should expect for signs of

the estimated aa, which represent the effects of quality differentials on models

of different ages sold contemporaneously, holding time fixed. According to one

line of thinking, new models of superior quality should command a premium price,

and if market competition forced the valuations of characteristics of incumbent

models to obsolesce at the same rate, prices of surviving vintages would decline

appropriately, and since the time dummy captures the full price effect, one might

expect estimates of a1, a2 and a3 to be approximately zero. On the other hand,
                    MICROCOMPUTER PRICES                 -
                                                             Page 12 -

selectivity   in the marketplace reveals survival of the fittest, and if there are

unmeasured characteristics (e.g. ,    compatible software or hardware, differential
service policies and warranties), then the age coefficients may to some extent be

providing an eatimate of the unobserved positive quality differentials among the

survivors as vintages progress. To unscramble the obsolescence and selectivity

components of the estimated age coefficients, one would need to assume that all

of the quality differences among vintages were already captured in the changing

computer characteristics and their associated coefficients, assuring thereby that

age coefficients reflected selectivity alone.

      Alternatively, one might specify a regression equation using the vintage V

and age A dummy variables, rather than the T and A as in (2),

              ln "ivat —   a + V'% + A'Ca + X'fi + uivat,

where, say, the V82 vintage dummy variable was omitted. In terms of interpreta-

tion, note that if the technical characteristic variables captured virtually all

of the quality changes embodied in models, then the vintage coefficients would

essentially be capturing the average decline in prices by vintage, which in turn

is some average of the difference between A and the implicit T over ages.

Similarly, given that the specification (3) conditions on vintages, one can

interpret the tma age coefficients as representing some average of implicit time

coefficients, since by the identity (1), A • T       -   V for all vintages.

      In spite of its apparent similarity with (2) given the identity (1), the

specification in (3) is in fact quite different, except for the special case when

models of only one age are considered (e.g., only AGE—O models). There are

several reasons for this. First, the number of dummy variable coefficients is

greater in (3) than in (2), for in (2) there are six time (T83-T88) and three age

(Al-A3) coefficients, while in (3) there are nine vintage (V79-V88, V82 omitted)

and three age (Al-A3) parameters. Thus in general one should not expect least

squares estimates of a, 0a and fi    to   be the same in the two specifications.

                                                               Page 13 -

      Second, while the age coefficients condition on time in (2), in (3) the

conditioning is on vintage. In particular, in (3) the aa age coefficients are

interpreted as the effect on price of age (relative to a new model), holding

vintage V (not time T) fixed. Since the conditioning changes, least squares

estimates should also be expected to differ in (2) and (3).

      To understand this better, consider a V-A specification such as (3). An

implicit time coefficient such as that for, say, T88 could be computed in four

different ways:

     at,88 — av,88 +aO          t,88 — av,87 +
           — av86 +
     at,88          a,2'         and/or at,88 —    av,85   +
                                                               aa,3.          (4)

Similarly, with the T-A specification as in (2), the implicit vintage coefficient

for, say, V85, could be computed alternatively as

     av85 —     t,85   -
                           aa,O, av,85 — at,86
                                                  -



     aV8S   —
                t87 a2'-
                                 and/or a85 — at,88            aa,3.          (5)

Least squares estimation of the V-A and T-A specifications implicitly weight and

average over these four possibilities in different ways, and thus there is no

reason to expect implicit and direct estimates of the a., aa, and/or at

coefficients to be numerically equivalent in the T-A and V-A models.

      But if the V-A and T-A specifications yield varying estimates because of

their distinct conditioning and use of differing information, how is one to

choose among them? For purposes of computing quality-adjusted price indexes, the

directly estimated time coefficients based on (2) have a clear interpretation,

and for that reason specification (2) has formed the basis of almost all hedonic

price index studies. But is it necessary to delete the V variables completely --

can one not employ a specification that efficiently uses information simultane-

ously from the T, A and V dummy variables, yet avoids exact collinearity?

     This issue has been addressed by Robert E. Hall (1971] whose context

involved use of a balanced panel data set for second-hand trucks. In our
                        MICROCOMPUTER PRICES                      -
                                                                      Page 14 -
Context,       the maximal parameterization consistent with avoiding exact collinearity

among the T, V and A dummy variables turns out to be one in which eight of the

original ten vintage dummy variables are added to the T-A specification (2), i.e.

two (not one) of the vintage dummies are deleted from the original set of ten

(V79 to V88).10'11 We can write such a specification as

                 in E'ivat —   a + T'at   +
                                              A'aa +   V'a   +   X'$ + Uivat,               (6)

where the vector of dummy variables in V consists of eight elements. As Hall

noted, coefficients on the a should be interpreted as differences from the

average rate of growth of technical progress embodied but unobserved in pairwise

comparisons of vintages. For example, if one omitted the V82 and V83 dummy

variables, the a., coefficient estimates should then be interpreted as a contrast,

e.g. ,   the   coefficient on the V88 dummy variable should then be interpreted as the

difference between the average 1988 vintage effect and the mean of the average

vintage effects for 1982 and 1983. We suggest that a necessary condition for a

hedonic price equation to be satisfactory is that the portion of quality change

not captured by the characteristics variables should be unrelated to vintages,

i.e. in a desirable specification, the a should be approximately zero.

         It follows that since the mq         coefficients       represent contrasts in average

rates of growth due to unobserved quality change, one can interpret a test that

the a — 0 as corresponding to a test that changes in characteristics among

models and over time adequately capture quality changes between vintages, for

average unobserved vintage effects are not systematically different in pairwise

comparisons among vintages. Further, if it were found that the a.q are

simultaneously different from zero, then one might interpret that result as

suggesting model misspecification, reflecting either the impact of omitted

characteristic variables, or invalid stability constraints on the characteristics

parameters over time. Hence, as noted above, a desirable specification would
                    MICROCOMPUTER PRICES           -
                                                       Page 15 -

yield   non-rejection of the null hypothesis that the a simultaneously equal zero,

in which case (2) would be empirically supported as a special case of (6)).2

        Hypotheses concerning parameter restrictions can of course be tested using

the standard F-test methodology. As has been emphasized by, among    others,
Kenneth Arrow [1960] and Makoto Ohta and Zvi Griliches [1976], when samples are

large and standard test procedures are employed, one is likely to reject most

simplifying parameter restrictions on purely statistical grounds, even though

they may still serve as adequate approximations for the purpose at hand. There

are several ways one can deal with this problem.

        First, to accommodate the larger sample size, we can compensate by choosing

very tight significance levels for the standard F-tests. In this paper we do

that by choosing .01 significance levels. Second, one can adopt a more agnostic

and conservative criterion that the null hypothesis holds only approximately

rather than exactly in the sample. In such a case, as Edward Learner [1978] has

shown, one can employ a Bayes procedure that in essence decreases the

significance level as the sample size n increases. Thus a second criterion we

use to assess the validity of our hypotheses is the Bayes factor asymptotic

approximation developed by Learner [1978, pp. 108.114], translated from the

condition that it exceeds one into an F-value expression. We call this Learner-

Bayes critical value the Bayes criterion.13

        Third and finally, since our hedonic regressions are semi-logarithmic, the

root mean squared errors (RNSE) measure the unexplained variation in prices in,

roughly, percentage units. A reasonable criterion is to use the difference in

the RNSE of the constrained and unconstrained regressions as a relevant measure

of the price-explanatory power of a particular model. As our third test

criterion, we therefore will reject the null hypothesis when the RMSE under the

alternative results in a reduction of more than 5Z in the RNSE (the standard

deviation of the unexplained variation in log prices). With an average R4SE of
                   MICROCOMPUTER PRICES           -
                                                      Page 16 -
around 0.40, this RMSE criterion implies that we are looking for a movement of at

least about 0.02, say, 0.40 to 0.38, before we will "give up" on the more

parsimonious parsmeterization implied by the null hypothesis.



IV.   INITIAL RESULTS

      We begin with results from a T-A model in which the time and age dummy

variables are included, but the vintage dummies are omitted, as in (2). Results

from such a regression are presented in Table 5. The dependent variable is the

logarithm of the real price (LRPRICE), and the variables are essentially those as

in Cohen and Kim. Regression results are reported for a pooled sample, retail

price observations, and discount price observations. Recall that in many cases,

s particular model appears in both the retail and discount markets. Given the

specification of dummy variables, the estimated intercept term corresponds to

that for a model of age zero in 1982 having an 8-bit processor, no monitor or

extras, is not portable, is not in the discount market, and is made by IBM.

      A number of results are worth noting. The coefficient on 1)1HZ is positive

and significant in all three regressions, but is largest in the discount market;

parameters on the LSLOTS variable follow a similar pattern. By contrast,

parameters on LRAM and LNUNFLP, though positive and significant, are larger in

the retail than discount market.

      Second, in all three regressions the coefficients on the age variables are

positive, holding time fixed, suggesting that the age effects of selectivity are

substantial. Interestingly, the effect of age is largest in the retail market,

where the age premium is statistically significant and increases with age,

implying that list prices of all surviving computers do not drop "fast enough".

In the discount market, however, the age coefficients are statistically

insignificant and follow no pattern. This suggests that some type of selectivity

is occuring in the tranaition from retail to discount markets, and that

conditional   on having entered the discount market, there is little age

selectivity remaining.

        In terms of other dummy variable coefficients, estimates of PROC16 and

PROC32 are positive, statistically significant and larger in the retail than

discount market, and the positive DPORT parameter estimate is larger in the

discount market. Although the general pattern of the time dummy variable

coefficient estimates is similar in the retail and discount markets -   - both
revealing declines in quality-adjusted prices since 1982, in the discount market

the pattern of estimates between D83, D84 and D85 is not monotonic, suggesting

that the discount market is more volatile, or that our discount sample is too

small in these years to generate reliable parameter estimates.

        Notice also that the DDISC coefficient in the pooled regression is negative

(-   .2903) and significant, as expected. We tested the null hypothesis that, aside
from a parallel shift due to being in the discount market, all coefficients are

identical in the retail and discount markets. The F-test statistic corresponding

to this null hypothesis is 2.77, while the .01 critical value is 1.73. Hence, on

the basis of the F-test criterion, the null hypothesis of parameter equality in

discount and retail markets is rejected. However, the Bayes critical value is

7.39, considerably greater than the F-statistic of 2.77. In terms of RMSE, the

improvement under the alternative hypothesis is 1.94X. Overall, we interpret

these results as suggesting that the evidence supporting the null hypothesis of

parameter equality (aside from a parallel shift) in the two markets is modest.

        We also checked Out two other Chow-type tests. First, we ran separate

regressions for the age equal zero, one, two and three years old sub-samples, and

compared the residual sums of squares with that from the pooled model reported in

column one of Table 5. The calculated F-test statistic is 2.66, while the .01

4.52%.     Hence, although a tight   criterion   suggests rejection of the null, the

more conservative Bayes and RMSE approaches lend only marginal support in favor

of the alternative hypothesis.

         Finally, we ran seven yearly regressions, one for each year from 1982 to

1988, and then compared the residual sums of squares from these regressions with

that from the pooled model reported in column one of Table 5. Here we found more

support for the notion of parameter instability. In particular, while the F-test

statistic for the null hypothesis of parameter equality is 5.18 with a .01

critical value of 1.32, the Bayes critical value is larger at 9.03. However, the

improvement in RMSE under the alternative hypothesis is substantial -- 15.76%.

Thus, parameters do not appear to be stable. We will return to a discussion of

parameter instability over time later in this section.

        As discussed earlier, an alternative functional form specification involves

including vintage and age dummies -- see equation (3), instead of the time and

age dummies as in (2). Recall that regression results (including R2, parameter

estimates and standard errors) will vary somewhat when using the V-A

specification rather than the T-A representation, and that this should not be

surprising, for in (2) the total number of T-A-V dummy variable coefficients

estimated directly is nine, while in (3) it is twelve. The summary statistics

results found in the very bottom portion of Table 6 illustrate this variation

among   the   various T-A and V-A specifications, for R2 and R1'tSE values differ.14

        One result of particular interest here concerns the age coefficients. As

is seen in Table 6, with the V-A specification the age coefficients become

negative and statistically significant, and increase in absolute value with age.

We interpret these age coefficients, conditioning on vintage, as capturing the

average decline in prices of surviving computer models given steady improvements

in new computers entering the market, i.e. as the average difference between the

time and vintage effects. In a somewhat vague sense, therefore, these age

coefficients capture the average effect of technical progress-induced

obsolescence in our sample.

       Since the interpretations and results from the T-A and V-A specifications

differ considerably, and although our purpose of computing price indexes lends

priori support to use of the T-A model specification in Table 5, one might still

question whether using information from vintages in addition to that contained in

the T-A model significantly improves model fit. In the previous section we noted

that a full T-A-V specification is possible, provided that two variables are

deleted from the V vector. Moreover, in our context a test for the null

hypothesis that the a   coefficients    are simultaneously equal to zero can be

interpreted as a specification test, providing information on whether the effects

of unobserved and omitted characteristic variables are systematic
                                                                                among vintage
comparisons, and/or whether equality constraints on characteristics parameters

       We therefore ran an additional regression in which eight vintage dummy

variables were added to the model reported in column 1 of Table 5, and V82 and

V83 were deleted. The F-test statistic for the null hypothesis that cxv —          0 is

5.94, the traditional .01 F-critical value is 2.51, the Bayes criterion value is

7.09, and the improvement in RMSE under the alternative hypothesis is 4.84%.

Thus the traditional F-test suggests rather decisive rejection of the null

hypothesis, the Bayes criticsl value of 7.09 is only slightly larger than the

calculated F-statistic of 5.94, and the improvement in RNSE is almost up to our

5% threshhold. Hence, although the evidence is not clearcut, we interpret these

results as providing some support for the alternative hypothesis, and therefore

as admonishing us to assess our T-A specification in column 1 of Table S more

closely, examining in particular what implicit parameter restrictions might be

contributing to rejection of the null hypothesis.

        This led us back to examine our earlier year-by-year regressions, and to

look for patterns of parameter inequality over time. Our inspection revealed

that although coefficients on a number of variables trended over time, the most

marked trends were for coefficients on the LRAM, 121HZ, LHRDDSK and DOTHER

variables. We then specified and estimated two additional models, one an

overlapping sample model in which three separate regressions were run for the

overlapping years 1982-84, 1984-86 and 1986-88, and the other a pooled 1982-88

run with four time-interaction variables added, LRAM*TC, UIHZ*TC, LHRDDSK*TC and

DOTHER*TC, where TC is a time counter increasing annually from zero in 1982 to

six in 1988. Results from these overlavoing and time-interaction regressions are

presented in Table 7.

       The results presented in Table 7 represent an improvement in the model

specification, accounting somewhat for the considerable variation among parameter

estimates over time. For example, in the 1982-84, 1984-86 and 1986-88

regressions, coefficient estimates on 12AM, LHRDDSK, LNUMFLP and DOTHER fall

continuously,   while that on 111HZ increases. Trends are also apparent in several

other coefficients. Moreover, when the pooled 1982-88 regression model with

time-interactions is estimated, negative and statistically significant estimates

are obtained for LRAM*TC (-.0885), LHRDDSK*TC (-.0137) and DOTHER*TC (-.0648),

while that on LMHZ*TC (.037) is positive and significant. Hence both of these

more general specifications appear to provide improved estimates.

      To check further on the validity of these two specifications, we added to

each regression the set of eight dummy vintage variables, and then tested the

null hypothesis that o,. —   0.   Our results are more satisfying, and lend qualified

support for the models reported in Table 7. In particulsr, as shown in Table 8

below, for 1982-84 and 1984-86, the calculated F-statistics are less than the .01

critical values, for 1986-88 the calculated F-statistic is larger, but in all

three cases F-statistics sre smaller than the Bayes criterion, and the improve-

ment in RMSE with vintage variables included is less than 1.5%. Hence, for all

three overlapping models, whatever the effects of omitted and unobserved

charscteristics, they do not appear to be systematic among vintage comparisons.

      With the pooled 1982-88 time-interaction model, results sre roughly similar

to those from the overlapping models. The cslculated F-statistic is larger than

the .01 critical value but less than half the Bayes criterion, and the

improvement in the RMSE when vintage variables are added is less than 1%. Thus

there is little basis to choose among these two specifications. However, we

expect that the constant change in parameters implied by the interactive time

counter would become increasingly inappropriate as additional time observations

were added. On this criterion, therefore, we have a mild preference for the

specification involving three overlapping regressions.

        Although further experimentation with other combinations of characteristics

variables would most likely be useful, we now move on to using several of the

above most promising specifications to construct quality-adjusted price indexes

for PC's.




V.      PRICE INDEXES

        Price indexes can be constructed in a variety of ways using the results of

our various hedonic price equations. Although possibilities are limited when

quantity sales data on the various models are unavailable, numerous procedures

can be implemented given enough available data. In this section we construct and

comment on several price indexes, all based on our hedonic regression equations,

but varying in their interpretation and in their use of parameter estimates and

quantity weights.

        We begin with price indexes based on direct transformation of estimated

hedonic price coefficients, and interpreted as price indexesholding quality
                       MICROCOMPUTER PRICES            -

constant      over time. In the first three rows of Table 9 we present implicit PC

price indexes computed directly from the three T-A regression equations reported

in Table 5, constructed here simply as the exponentiated estimated coefficients

on the time dummy variables, with T82 set to zero. The values in psrentheses are

percent changes from the previous year, computed as lOO*(PIt -         PIt.j)/PIt1,
where P1 is the price index. Note that the price indexes in the T-A model are

the estimated time effects from regressions holding age and other characteristics

constant. Overall, we see that average annual growth rates (AACR) are similar

for the pooled, retail and discount equations (about -28% per year), although the

deflators for discounted models tend to be somewhat unstable from 1983 to 1985.

        In the second set of three rows in Table 9, implicit price indexes are

presented based on direct exponentiation of the estimated vintage coefficients

from the V-A specifications in Table 6. The interpretation of these price

indexes is slightly different --       they are not time effects, but rather are based
on vintage coefficients, holding age and other characteristics fixed. As is seen

in Table 9, these price indexes suggest slightly alower declines in quality

adjusted prices than those based on T-A regressions (especially for discount

models), and also reveal greater instability, particularly between 1982 and 1985.

        One might think of these V-A price indexes as tracing out quality-adjusted

price deflators for various vintages having AGE — 0 (since price indexes for 1979

to 1988 are computed directly from the V79 to V88 vintage coefficients, assuming

AGE —   0),   but estimation of the underlying coefficients is based on a sample

including models of all ages. An alternative procedure for constructing a price

index for new models only -    - an   index that might be construed as tracing out the

technological "frontier" -    - is   to estimate parameters from a dats sample

restricted to new models, i.e. to models with AGE — 0.          Implicit price indexes

computed from such a regression are reported in the row named "New Models Only"

in Table 9l5 There it is seen that a "new model only" price index declines more

rapidly   than those based on full-sample T-A and V-A specifications; in

particular, the AACR from 1982 to 1988 is -30.15%.

      The two final implicit price indexes computed directly from hedonic

regression equations without use of quantity sales weights are given in Table 9

in the rows marked "Overlapping" and "Time Interactions". The overlapping price

indexes are based on the three overlapping regressions reported in Table 7. They

are computed by directly exponentiating the coefficient estimates on the time

dummy variables, linked so that, for example, the implicit 1985 and 1986 price

indexes are the products of the exponentiated coefficients for 1984 and 1985, and

1984 and 1986, respectively. Notice that with an overlapping index procedure,

the quality weights are constant only for sub-periods, and coefficient estimates

reflect varying sample means among sub-periods. Interestingly, the overlapping

price indexes fall at almost the same AAGR as that based on a "new models only"

regression, although the overlapping price indexes fall more rapidly in the

earlier years.

      The computation of price indexes based on the time-interaction model

requires use of sample characteristics data, not just values of estimated

coefficients. For example, using parameter estimates on the time interaction

terms reported in Table 7, for the log-change in quality-adjusted prices between

year t and year t-l we first compute

      ln Pt -    ln Ptl   — (at   -

where the     on LRAM, 1)4HZ, LHRDOSK and DOThER refers to the sample mean of

these variables between years t and t-l. To calculate the price index, we simply

cumulate the values in (7) over 1982-1988 (letting a1982 —                  0),   and then

exponentiate them. Results from such a computation are presented in the "Time

Interactions" row of Table 9. There we see that use of this price index

procedure results in a very substantial rate of price decline - -        more   than 33%

per year. This large decline reflects the fact that sample means of the

variables are all increasing with time, and these means are multiplied by the

relatively large negative coefficients in (7).

      One   important   problem with each of the above price indexes is that they

fail to reflect changes over time in the mix of models. Recall that the
                    MICROCOMPUTER PRICES                            -
                                                                         Page 29 -
direct   hedonic regression coefficients in the T-A models can be interpreted as

holding quality constant either by fixing the base of characteristic values

over time, or by fixing their valuation (parameter estimates). In a world

with rapidly evolving new technologies, the notion of a fixed characteristic

base as portraying representative transactions becomes increasingly

inappropriate. What would be preferable is an index number procedure that

accounts for compositional changes in models over time.16 Such a computation

requires, of course, quantity and revenue sales data by model by year. As our

final index number computations, we now consider a Divisia index that weights

quality-adjusted prices of models by their revenue shares.

      Specifically, our calculation of a (Tornqvist approximation to the)

Divisia index proceeds as follows. First consider a model j observed in both

time periods 0 and 1. Let

               in    —
                          Zjj    +       âl   +        and                                       (8a)

                          Zó,j          Eoj,                                                     (8b)

where Z1j and Z0j are vectors of all regression variables except for the

time dummy variables in years 1 and 0, the a's are estimated coefficients on

the time dummy variables, and the 's are least squares residuals. This

implies that

   ln Pj -     ln     —
                          (Zj        -

which can be rearranged to yield the expression

                                                                 &o) +   (Eli

                                                                                    'oj)   (9)

The left-hand side of (9) states that the log-change in the quality-adjusted

price of model j from 0 to 1 equals the change in observed prices minus the

change in quality, where quality is evaluated using least squares regression

coefficients and values of the characteristics. Alternatively, the right-hand

side of (9) states that an equivalent way of computing the log-change in the

quality-adjusted price of model j is simply to sum                      the   difference in estimated
                           MICROCOMPUTER PRICES            -

time dummies plus the difference in least squares residuals. The choice of
which of these two methods to employ in computing quality-adjusted prices can

be baaed simply on relative computational convenience.

        Several other features of (9) are worth noting. First, if there is no

change in the characteristics of model j between 0 and 1 (i.e. ,              the   model has

not become a new version in period 1), then (Zjj -                      — 0, this term
                                                                 16j)
drop outs of (9), and in essence the quality-adjusted log price change is

computed using the traditional matched model procedure. Second, if the least

squares residual is the same in the two time periods, i.e. if 'lj -                     — 0,

then the log-change in quality-adjusted prices is simply equal to the change

in the time dummy coefficients. Note that residuals have a useful

interpretation in the hedonic price equation, for they provide evidence on

whether relative to the overall market, a particular model is over- or under-

priced.17 An interesting issue concerns the relationship between these

residuals and the revenue shares garnered by each model. Since for each year

the sum of residuals is zero, we would expect that if shares are uncorrelated

with residuals, it would also be the case that X                   = 0.

        Once (9) is computed for every model j in years 0 and 1, the log-change

in quality adjusted prices over all models is calculated as the revenue shsre-

weighted sum        of   the individual model j   log-changes   in quality-adjusted prices,

where the -      superscript     is the quality-adjusted price (computed for individusl

       and 5j,o and sj is the share of model j's value of shipments in the

total value of shipments over all models in the appropriate time period.

      The calculation in (9) is feasible only when model j is part of a

surviving cohort of models. In fact, however some models exit the market

each year, while others enter. To account for these entering and exiting

models, several adjustments must be made to (9) and (10).

      Consider the case of a model that enters the market in time period 1.

Obviously, its price cannot be observed in period 0, and thus use of (9) to

compute a quality-adjusted price index is not feasible. One                            can,   however, use

the estimated hedonic regression equation to predict such missing prices. In

particular, substitute the right-hand side of (8b) into (9), let the values of

Z1j and Zo be equal, set               to zero, and rearrange. This yields an

expression for quality-adjusted log-price changes for entering models in

period 1, computed in two alternative but equivalent ways as

            ln P1 -
                           ZjjP    -      -        -        +
                                                                j.                        (11)

Similarly, for exiting models that were observed in period 0 but not in period

I, we employ hedonic regression procedures to predict the price of that model

would it have survived to period 1.               Specifically, we substitute (8a) into

                              —    O
(9), set Z1j —
                 Zoj and                and then rearrange. This yields the



                     + al -   ln   o,j —      l
appropriate log-change in the quality-adjusted prices for exiting models as

                                                  -
                                                       °o   -

      Once these log-changes in quality-adjusted prices are computed for all
                                                                                          (12)




continuing, entering and exiting models, we calculate revenue shares (setting

so,j to zero for entering models, and 5l,j to zero for exiting models, thereby

effecively using one-half of the last or first observed share weight), and

then compute an aggregate log-change in quality-adjusted prices over all

models using (10).

      Several other points are worth noting. First, an interesting feature of

(9), (11) and (12) is that they employ as information the values of the least

squares residuals. Hence the Divisia quality-adjusted index number procedure
                  MICROCOMPUTER PRICES            -
                                                      Page 32 -

takes into account whether those models that exited (or entered) had prices

above or below the average quality-adjusted prices. Note, however, that the

weight given these exiting and entering models is likely to be minor, since

their average revenue share in periods 0 and 1 is in most cases rather small.

      Second, empirical implementation of this Divisia index number procedure

requires data on value of shipments by model. Proprietary data on shipments,

installations and value of shipments by model and year for about 950 of the

1265 models in our estimation sample were kindly provided us by the

International Data Corporation. These data formed the basis of our share-

weights used in (10).

      Restricting our sample to models covered by the IDC data set and

computing revenue values by model-year as the product of the IDC estimates of

average price paid and number of models shipped, we have computed Divisia

quality-adjusted price indexes separately for continuing, entering and exiting

models, and for selected aggregates)8 Our results, using parameter estimates

from the T-A pooled and T-A overlapping estimated models, are presented in

Table 10. A number of results are worth noting.

     We begin with results from the T-A pooled estimation. Inspection of the

top row of Table 10 reveals that the real quality-adjusted Divisia price index

for all PC models declined at an AAGR of -28.2X from 1982 to 1988, virtually

identical to the -28.7% AACR of the direct hedonic T-A pooled price index. A

striking difference between these two price indexes, however, is that the

Divisia index reveals a much smoother decline over time, with year-to-year

declines ranging between 20% and 37%, whereas year-to-year declines for the

direct I-A pooled index vary from 1% to 36%.

      Second, changes in the price indexes for the continuing models are quite

different from those models entering and exiting between 1982 and 1988.

Specifically, if one examines the next three rows in Table 10, one sees that

the price declines of the continuing models were on average larger (-30.6%)
                  MICROCOMPUTER PRICES           -
                                                     Page 34 -

than thosa for the entering (-24.9%) and exiting (-20.0%) models. An
implication is that vendors of incumbent models responded quite aggressively

to the competition provided by entrants, dropping prices at relatively high

rates. Note that these reaults can be reconciled with the econometric

findings reported earlier that in the T-A specification, estimated

coefficients on the age variables were positive, provided one interprets the

latter result as reflecting selectivity due to, perhaps, unobserved positive

quality differentials among the survivors as vintages progress.

      Third, the pricing strategies employed for entering and exiting models

are quite different. Over the 1982-88 time period, quality-adjusted price

declines for entering models were on average larger (-24.9%) than those for

exiting models (-20.0%). However, while the quality-adjusted prices were on

average flat between 1982 and 1985 for exiting models, these models exhibited

very large price declines from 1985 to 1988.

      In the final set of four rows of Table 10, we present Divisia price

indexes using parameter estimates from the 1982-84, 1984-86 and 1986-88

overlapping regressions. The remarkable result here is that in spite of using

a rather different set of regressions, average annual growth rates of quality-

adjusted prices from 1982 to 1988 are hardly affected. Specifically, the AACR

for all computer models based on the pooled and overlapping regressions are,

respecitvely, -28.2 and -28.0%; for continuing models, -30.6% and -30.5%; for

entering models, -24.9% and -22.4%; and for exiting models, -20.0% and -23.7%.

Although year-to-year variations occur between the Divisia pooled and

overlapping regression price indexes, AACR are reasonably robust.



VI.   SUMMARY REMARKS

      The simultaneous existence of incumbent, entering and exiting models

raises issues of product heterogeneity in the microcomputer market, the nature

of   price and quality competition, and creates ambiguity in how one constructs

and interprets price indexes. Those are the issues on which we have focused

in this paper.

       Specifically, we have reported results from estimation of a variety of

hedonic regression equations using en unbalanced panel data set for 1265

model-years from 1982 to 1988, and have developed and implemented empirically

a specification test for selecting preferable hedonic price equations. We

have discussed in detail the alternative interpretation of dummy variable

coefficients in models having time and age, vintage and age, and all of the

time, age and vintage dummy variables as regressors. Based on these estimated

hedonic price equations, we then computed quality-adjusted price indexes using

a variety of procedures. This provided us with indexes having varying

interpretations --   constant   average quality price indexes, price indexes for

new models only, and quality-adjusted price indexes portraying representative

transactions that take into account the changing model composition in our

sample over time. Not surprisingly, average annual growth rates for these

varying price indexes also differed, although all showed a substantial decline

in quality-adjusted prices over the 1982-88 time period.

       Our research in this paper is preliminary, and much still remains to be

done. One item high on our research agenda involves obtaining model-specific

performance measures for specific numerical tasks, such as the number of

instructions executed per unit of time, and then re-doing our hedonic

regressions with such performance measures added as regressors. Moreover,

issues of parameter instability and choice of variables to include in the set

of characteristics are also potentially important, and need further

examination. Finally, our least squares residuals provide economic

information either on over- or under-pricing of models relative to the market

as a whole, or else reflect the effects of omitted variables or differential

market power in different PC market segments. Hence an interesting applica-

tion involves examining in greater detail the relationships among residuals,

entering, continuing, and exiting models, and realized market shares.

FOOTNOTES



1See, for example, the classic study by Gregory Chow [1957], as well as more
recent ones by Robert B. Archibald and William S. Reece [1978], Robert J.
Gordon [1989,1990], Robert Michaels [1979], Stephen D. Oliner [1986], and Jack
E. Triplett [l989a]

   very brief discussion of PC's is presented in Robert J. Gordon [1989,1990].
Also see the unpublished paper by Brian Catron [1989].

3Hedonic regression methods and their interpretation are discussed in, among
others, Zvi Griliches [1961,1971,1988). Jack E. Triplett [1986], and Ernst R.
Berndt [1990, chapter 4] .  Theoretical foundations for interpreting hedonic
price equations are found in, among others, Sherwin Rosen [1974] and Dennis
Epple [1987]. For an historical discussion on the incorporation of hedonic
regression methods into official price indexes, see Triplett [1990].

4Precisely how the BEA PC price index is constructed is not clear. According
to David W. Cartwright and Scott D. Smith [1988, p. 22], "For personal
computers (PC's), a matched model index was introduced in 1987. It is now
constructed using price changes of IBM PC's, judgmentally adjusted by BEA to
reflect price changes for other models, for 1983 and price changes of models
sold by IBM and three additional manufacturers for 1984-87."

5The first PC advertising appeared in the New York Times in 1981.

6A model is defined as discounted if it is sold by a vendor other than the
brand-name manufacturer. Thus, for example, IBM models sold by IBM are
considered as retail price observations, while IBM models sold by Computerland
or 47th Street Photo are treated as discounted price observations. PC Limited
models (sold only by mail order from PC Limited) are treated as retail, since
PC Limited is the only vendor.

7However, one cannot identify parameters in a full quadratic expansion of the
three variables, due to the identity in (1). For a discussion in the context
of age, period and cohort models, see Stephen Fienberg and William Mason
[1985].

   related discussion of this issue in the context of age, period and cohort
effects in earnings equations is presented by James Heckinan and Richard Robb
(1985].

9See, for example, David W. Cartwright and Scott D. Smith (1986] , Rosanne Cole
et al. (1986], Robert J. Gordon (1989] and Jack E. Triplett (1989a].

10See especially Robert Hall (1971], p. 248.

There is intuitive appeal to this additional normalization. Hall defined
the price index as the product of vintage effects (embodied technical
progress), depreciation, and time (disembodied technical progress). Thus the
logarithm of the price index is the sum of these three effects, each in rates
of growth. To normalize the level of the price index, one normalizes levels
of each of the three effects, i.e., one deletes one variable from each of the
T, V and A dummy variable sets, and normalizes relative to that variable. But
in addition, one must normalize at least one of the growth rates, since the
product of the three effects implies that components are unidentified. This
additional normalization is accomplished by deleting an additional vintage

variable, thereby yielding a contrast in levels of the logarithmic regression,
which is equivalent to a normalization in growth rates of one of the three
components. For additional discussion, see Robert Hall [1971].

l2 is worth noting here that the choice of which two dummy variables to
delete from the V vector is arbitrary in the sense that goodness of fit and
numerical values of least squares estimates of a and the fl's will be
unaffected. However, the interpretation and numerical values of the least
squares estimates of the a, a and my will depend on this choice.

131..eamer has derived this to equal (nk).(q1n - l)/q, where n is sample size,
k is the number of free parameters estimated in the unconstrained regression,
and q is the number of parameter restrictions. For an application of Learner's
adjustment to the standard F-test procedure in the Context of large samples,
see Makoto Ohta and Zvi Griliches [1976].

Whi1e not reported here for reasons of space, it is worth noting that the
slope coefficient estimates differ between the T-A and V-A specifications,
although in many cases the differences are not large.

15The underlying regression equation is of the same form as in Table 5, except
that age variables are deleted. Price indexes are computed directly by
exponentiating the estimated coefficients on the time dummy variables.

16For a recent discussion of weighting issues in the context of compositional
changes, see Jack A. Triplett [l989b] and the references cited therein.

17This under- or over-pricing might also reflect of course the effects of
unobserved omitted variables, or of differential market power in differing
segments of the PC market.

18We divided revenues among retail and discount listings of the same model in
proportion to the relative number of listings. It is also worth noting that
mean values of the revenue shares of continuing, entering and exiting models
from 1982 to 1988 are 54Z, 26% and 20%, respectively. There is considerable
variation in these shares over our sample time period, however.
