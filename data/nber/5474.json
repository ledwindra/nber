    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper develops a two-good, two-country model with national open access renewable resources.  We derive an appropriate analog of `factor proportions' for the renewable resource case and link it to trade patterns and to the likelihood of diversified production.  The resource importer gains from trade.  However, a diversified resource exporting country necessarily suffers a decline in steady state utility resulting from trade, and may lose along the entire transition path.  Thus the basic `gains from trade' presumption is substantially undermined by open access resources.  Tariffs imposed by the resource importing country always benefit the resource exporter, and may be pareto-improving.\n\n",
