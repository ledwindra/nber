    "abstract": "\n\nI study cohort patterns in the labor market outcomes of recent college graduates, examining changes surrounding the Great Recession. Recession entrants have lower wages and employment than those of earlier cohorts; more recent cohorts\u2019 employment is even lower, but the newest entrants\u2019 wages have risen. I relate these changes to \"scarring\" effects of initial conditions. I demonstrate that adverse early conditions permanently reduce new entrants\u2019 employment probabilities. I also replicate earlier results of medium-term scarring effects on wages that fade out by the early 30s. But scarring cannot account for the employment collapse for recent cohorts. There was a dramatic negative structural break in college graduates\u2019 employment rates, beginning around the 2005 entry cohort, that shows no sign of abating.\n\n",
