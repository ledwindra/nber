Equilibrium Wage Distributions
ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes equilibrium in labor markets with costly search.
Even in steady state equilibrium, identical labor may receive different

wages; this may be the case even when the only source of imperfect
information is the inequality of wages which the market is perpetuating.
When there are information imperfections arising from (symmetric)

differences in non-pecuniary characteristics of jobs and preferences of
individuals, there will not in general exist a full employment, zero profit
single wage equilibrium.

There are, in general, a multiplicity of equilbria. Equilibrium may be
characterized by unemployment; in spite of the presence of an excess supply

of labor, no firm is willing to hire workers at a lower wage. It knows that

if it does so, the quit rate will be higher, and hence turnover costs (training
costs) will be higher, so much so that profits will actually be lower. The
model thus provides a rationale for real wage rigidity. The model also
provides a theory of equilibrium frictional unemployment.

Though the constrained optimality (taking explicitly into account the
costs associated with obtaining information and search) may entail
unemployment and wage dispersion, the levels of unemployment and wage

dispersion in the market equilibrium will not, in general, be (constrained)

Introduction

The observation that different firms pay different prices for what
appears to be the same commodity or pay different wages for what appears to
be equivalent labor has long been explained in economics by a

"imperfect

reference to

information." This paper is concerned with characterizing market

equilibrium with imperfect information. We do not present a general theory;
rather, we develop in some detail an example of importance in its own right——

imperfect
in

information in the labor market.

Several

properties of our example,

particular, the existence of equilibria with price (wage) dispersion, i.m—

employment (excess supply of labor), positive profits (excess demand for labor),

multiple equilibria and the non—optimality of some or all of the equilibria,
we believe are of more general validity; other results may not be.
This paper is concerned with two kinds of imperfect information:

(a) Individuals may not know the wage paid in any particular firm, or
whether there is a vacancy in any particular firm, until they apply for a job.1

There are a number of characteristics besides the wage rate asso-

ciated with any job which are important to the individual. Some, like the
normal length of a work week, become known when the individual applies for
the job; information about other characteristics (e.g., personalities of
colleagues) is acquired only gradually.

There is one important difference between the two kinds of imperfect

information: there is a return to natching individuals up with jobs that
suit them in any economic system. There will be imperfect information of
this

sort so long as individuals and jobs differ. On the other hand, the

imperfect information resulting from wage dispersion is a kind of imperfect
information

generated by the market itself. In

particular, a socialist

economy could, if it chose, simply pay a uniform wage for identical labor.
We

are used to thinking

of markets as serving a useful function in conveying

information, e.g., about demands and

supplies,

Our analysis suggests that,

under certain conditions, the market may, in effect, unnecessarily "create"
imperfections

of information which, not surprisingly, may turn out to be

quite costly.
There are two problems in constructing an equilibrium odel with imper-

fect information: first, how do we prevent the eventual accumulation of

information? If individuals were infinitely lived, and jobs never changed,
eventually, through search,2 everyone would find the job which most suited

him. "Imperfect information" would only characterize the niarket in the short
run. In the discussion below, we maintain a "continual flow of ignorance"

through a continual flow of new entrants into the labor force and a flow of

deaths out of it.3 This "flow of ignorance" is just large enough to offset

—3--

the "flow of knowledge" resulting from search behavior, and

an

equilibrium

with imperfect information is sustained.
The second problem is, how do we induce different firms to pay different
wages?

That is, imperfect information may explain why individuals pay a

price for a commodity which is in excess of the lowest

price being charged

in the market, or why they accept a wage which is below the maximum being

paid in the market. But we still must explain

why some profit maximizing

firms charge one price or pay one wage while other firms charge another
price or pay another wage.

We argue that by paying a higher wage, the firm lovers labor turnover
and hence its expected returns on specific training. A low wage firm has

higher training costs. Under certain circumstances, the increase in training
costs is just sufficient to offset the low wages. Profits viewed as a function
of the wage paid must have more than one relative maxima, with the value of

profits at the different relative maxima identical. The somewhat surprising
result of this paper is that this can be the case under very

simple

conditions,

even when all firms have the same training costs.

There is an important interaction between the search for higher wage
jobs and the search for jobs which "match" one's preferences.

The existence

of wage dispersion clearly affects the profitability of searching for a

"better match." What is not so obvious, however, is that when there is in—
perfect information of the second type ("matching individuals to

jobs") there

cannot, in general, exist a single wage, zero profit equilibrium.
Previous studies have focused on firm behavior when facing individuals

whose turnover rates are affected by the wage rate (Mortenson (1970), Salop

—4—

(1973b), and with individual behavior in markets with wage dispersions
(Salop (1973a). But there have been no attempts to link the two sides of
the market together: the quit rate of the individuals is affected by the
wage distribution; the wage paid by the firm with a given training cost is
determined by the quit rate function, so the wage distribution in turn is

determined
any

by the distribution of training costs. Thus, corresponding to

distribution

of training costs there is an equilibrium distribution of

wages. But the wage rates and quit rates associated with any given level of
training costs must be such that these firms just break even (assuming free
entry).

Our analysis can thus be viewed as an attempt at a simple general

equilibrium formulation of the conventional search models. Such a formulation is required because in its absence we are likely to be misled into
formulating models in which there is not in fact wage or price dispersion,

because such an analysis is required if we are to make any valid

The Basic Model

2.1 Introduction
The basic model presented in this section is a simplified version of

the conventional search model. The basic ingredients (described more fully
below and modified in a number of ways in subsequent sections) are the
following:

(a) Individuals are continually searching for a better, i.e., in
our simplified model, higher paid, job. They quit when they successfully
find a better job. (In the basic model, the intensity of search will be an
exogenous parameter.)
(b) For simplicity, we assume only one coiruriodity which we choose
as

our numeraire. All production processes are characterized

returns

by constant

t scale, and there is free entry. Firms face specific training

costs. By paying higher wages, they reduce their turnover rate. The optimal
level of wages depends on their training costs.
The assumptions of free entry and the constant returns to scale property

of the technology make the zero profit condition seem natural. This in turn
has the implication that the scale of each firm is indeterminate; what is
determinate, however, is the wage distribution. Later, we shall show some

instances in which the zero profit condition may not be satisfied.
Implicitly,

model with which we are dealing here is a dynamic one.

hire workers and pay

the training costs one period, receiving the returns

subsequent periods. In making their decisions, they must form expectations

of future interest rates, prices, and other market conditions. We shall avoid
these problems by focusing on the long—run equilibrium, where the wage distribution, prices, etc., are invariant.

In the remainder of this section, we set up and

analyze

the equilibrium

of our simplified economy. We proceed in several stages: in Section 2.2 we
describe the behavior of individuals in the economy, while in Section 2.3 we
describe the behavior of firms as they face a given quit rate function.

Section 2.4 derives the quit rate function. Sections 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, and

2.8

construct equilibria with a single wage, with two wages, with multiple wages,
and

finally,

with a continuum of wages. Sections 2.9, 2.10, and

2.11

discuss

the welfare, comparative static, and stability properties of the equilibria.

2.2 Individual Behavior
We assume all individuals are identical.6 They die exponentially at

the rate i , and they are replaced by an equal number of new workers, so
that the labor supply remains constant at L .
unit

for

Each laborer supplies one

of labor. When individuals enter the labor force, they randomly apply
a job, which they accept. Meanwhile, they continue to

search for a

better, i.e., a higher paying job. The length of time to go from one

firm

to another to find out its wage is a random variable described by a Poisson

process; the average number of searches per unit of time is s , which

is

—7--

fixed.

There is no cost to search or to changing jobs, up to the search

intensity s ; more intensive search is prohibitively expensive. Individuals
do not know the wage paid by any particular firm; since s

is determined in

effect exogenously, we need make no assumption concerning whether the mdi—

vidual knows the wage distribution. Later (Section 4), however, we shall
have to be more explicit on this point.

2.3 The Behavior of the Firm: The
Given the Quit Rate

For

Function

simplicity, we assume production processes require only labor, no

capital,7 and have constant returns to scale. Thus, a production
process is
characterized by a fixed training cost per worker T ,

which is assumed to

occur instantaneously upon hiring the worker, and by a level of output per

man-year a(T) .

In

the model of this section we assume that the firm has no

choice of technique.7a

is to choose a wage. Clearly, if at
that wage rate it is making a profit, it will attempt to expand; if it makes
a loss, it will contract or change its wage. We shall be concerned with

The wage is chosen so that it maximizes the present discounted value of

its profits on each worker hired. Our restriction to stochastic equilibrium
analysis allows us to greatly simplify the problem, for then the wage is
constant over time, and is chosen to maximize:

Implications of the Basic Model

Our model has a number of important implications, which we take up in

this section. First, we show that most of the equilibria considered are not
Pareto efficient. Next, we show that a slight extension of our model generates equilibria with unemployment and with positive profits. Finally, we
consider the implications of our results for the analysis of comparative
statics for search equilibria.

3.1 Welfare Economics

the very nature of search and information there are important externalities which firms will not take into account.
By

First, as has

imperfect
information means that all firms have, as it were, some degree of imonopoly
long been recognized (see, e.g., Arrow (1959)),

power; they can obtain workers even though they pay less than the "market

wage." They quickly lose workers to other firms, but in the meanwhile, they

are able to exploit the absence of information, provided the costs of turnover
are not too high. But what has not been sufficiently recognized is that this
exercise of monopoly power is, in some sense, itself the cause of imperfect

information; that is, it is the exercise of this monopoly power which results
in the wage differentials, in the absence of which search would be unnecessary.
There is thus a cost, in addition to the direct loss of consumer surplus
usually
search

associated with the exercise of monopoly power, in the additional

and turnover costs.

There is the further externality imposed on the low wage firm by an in-

crease in the wage of a high wage firm: although it reduces its own quit
rate——which at equilibrium results in a reduction in turnover costs just

14-

sufficient
of

to compensate for the increased wage——it increases the quit

other firms and

the

rate

firm fails to take account of the additional turnover

costs of the other firms.

Note that all of the equilibria with wage distributions are Pareto

inferior to that with a single wage. The low wage individuals are unambiguously worse off and resources are wasted in training that otherwise would
not need to have been spent.

The low wage firms may claim that they have to pay low wages because
of their high turnover; but it is equally true that

because

3.2

they have a high

turnover

they pay low wages.
Unemployment Equilibria

The rigidity of real wages has long been recognized to play a central

role in generating unemployment equilibria. While older discussions ascribed
this rigidity to institutional factors, it has more recently been recognized
that if the wage affects the net productivity of the worker,'4 then the firm
may

not

lower its wage, even in the face of excess supply.

The usual story for why there cannot exist unemployment equilibria is
that if workers are unemployed, they offer to work for less; if the wage is
bid down, demand for labor is increased and

process

the supply is decreased. The

stops only when demand equals supply. In efficiency wage models,

this argument is not valid: firms may not hire workers at lower

wages if

to do so lowers their profits.

Here, lowering the wage increases the turnover rate, and hence firms
may be reluctant to lower the wage, even though there are workers available
willing to work for less.15

—)—

To show the nature of the unemployment equilibrium we replace our

assumption of a constant returns to scale technology with one with diminishing returns; there is an aggregate production function F(L)

,

and the full

employment wage is defined by

(3,1)

+ ( +

F'(L)

r)T

where L is the total available labor supply. The value of the marginal

product of labor at full employment equals the full employment real wage
plus

the

turnover costs. Now assume all firms

(3.2)

Then they will wish to hire workers only to the point where

is, there will be unemployment. Moreover, provided condition (2.7) is
satisfied, there is no wage which is acceptable to workers which yields a

higher

Hence

firms have no incentives either to change

the wage they pay or the number of workers they hire.

Note that if all firms could simultaneously change their wages, lowering
them to
caused

,

then full employment could be attained. Thus, unemployment is

by too high wages, but the excessively high wages come about not because

of union pressure; rather, the interactions of the wage
ferent firms,

policies of the dif-

and the inability of the different firms to coordinate their

wage policies, leads to an inefficient Nash equilibrium.

—16—

Indeed, it is easy to see in this model how a disturbance to the economy
can move it from a position of full employment to one of unemployment.

Assume, initially, that the economy were at full employment but then the technology is disturbed in such a way as to decrease the marginal product of

labor. So long as all other firms continue to pay w

,

it pays each firm

to continue to do so: all adjustments take place in the number of workers
hired.

16

Though in the model formulated here, there exists a full employment
single wage equilibrium, in the model presented in Section 5 the only single

wage equilibrium may

entail

unemployment.

3.3 Positive Profit Equilibrium
Though it seems natural enough to impose the zero profit condition in
a model with free entry

and constant

returns

to

scale, in models with costly

search, it is possible that there exist positive profit equilibria. The
usual story for why in equilibrium there must be zero profits is that if
profits are positive, some firm will attempt to recruit workers away from
the other firms,

bidding up the

wage; the process continues until there are

zero profits. But offering a slightly higher wage does not instantaneously
recruit all the workers, as it would if search costs were zero. By raising
its wage a little bit, the firm

succeeds

in recruiting a few more workers——

those who arrive at its doors with current wages higher than the old wage
but below the new wage.

17

The firm balances off the increased probability

of getting a worker with the decreased profits it gets per worker. Equilibrium
is characterized by the wages paid being profit maximizing wages, but not

necessarily zero profit wages. In equilibrium, all wages paid must make the

-17--

paying

Though in the model presented so far, there is no determinate

us to

this. Assume that each job requires a machine that costs $K. The

profits described above (Eq. 3.6) are thus the expected present discounted

value of the quasi—rents. As entry occurs, the probability of any worker
arriving at a firm declines, and hence following the departure of a worker,
the

expected time until the vacancy is filled increases; entry occurs until

the expected present discounted value of quasi—rents is equal to the price
of the machine. For simplicity, we assume a firm consists of one machine

costly search. While when condition (2.7) is satisfied there exists positive
profit and zero profit equilibria, when condition (2.7) is not satisfied the
only equilibria have positive profits, and are of the form we have described
in this section.

An Alternative Resolution. If there is more than one commodity, then
there is an alternative way that, even when condition (2.7) is not satisfied,

a full employment zero profit equilibrium may be attained. Assume that there
is a second sector requiring no specific training; we let the output of that

sector be our numeraire. As firms enter the industry requiring training in
response to positive profits, price falls and profits are reduced,21

Comparative Statics

Because

of the continuum of equilibria, it is difficult to do meaningful

comparative static calculations. The question we are particularly interested
in is, does an increase in the search intensity lead to a narrowing of the

wage distribution? Although the partial equilibrium analyses have suggested
that

it would, the general equilibrium analysis of this paper suggests that

the contrary may occur. Consider the two-wage equilibria. An increase in s
either lowers the wage paid by

the low wage firm—-because of the higher tum—

over they cannot "afford" to pay as high wages as previously——or

it reduces

This paper is mainly concerned with equilibrium analysis; yet is is

worth

noting in a heuristic manner an apparent instability of the multi—wage equilibria.

Consider the two-wage equilibrium. If a single firm happened to switch from

paying wage w

to paying wage w1 , w1

would become more profitable; all

the firms would switch. Conversely, if a single firm happened to switch from

paying w1 to paying w, w would become more profitable than w1 (since
now the turnover rate is lowered) and again it would pay all of the firms

paying w1 to switch. The only equilibrium which appears to be stable is
the single wage equilibrium. Again, not too much emphasis should be put on
this result, since, as we shall show in later sections, with slight elabora—
tions on the model, there may not even exist a single wage equilibrium.

Robustness of the Model
In developing the model of Section 2, we introduced a number of siinpli—

fying assumptions. We have

explored

the consequences of loosening the various

assumptions, and on the basis of these explorations, we believe our model is
robust; if anything, it becomes easier to generate wage distributions and

equilibria with unemployment or positive profits, In this section, we briefly
describe two extensions of the model, to consider the possibility that firms
have a choice of technique and that individuals have a choice of search inten-

sity (with alternative specifications of the search technology). In the next
section,

we consider

an

important extension to the case where firms

differ

in

their non—pecuniary characteristics.
4. 1

Choice of Techn

Allowing

firms to have a choice of technique does not seriously alter

the analysis. It does, however, permit us to generate a richer class of wage
distributions. We assume that output per man is an increasing concave function

4.2 Search Costs and

the

Determination of Search Intensity

If there are costs associated with undertaking search, then a rational
individual, in deciding how much search he should undertake, would compare
the expected benefits at each search intensity with the costs.

It

is natural

to assume that the costs are an increasing, convex function of search inten-

sity,
(4.9)

i.e., if C(s) is the cost per unit

of

time of search at intensity s

C' > 0

In effect, in our earlier analysis we assumed the cost function took on the
special shape depicted in Figure 6b.
The correct calculation of the benefits of search is not a siuLpie

matter. We must know what the individual's knowledge about the distribution

of wages is, his attitudes towards risk, as well as his expectations concerning the duration which he will keep any

job.

For instance, if the indi-

vidual does not know the wage distribution, not only does search yield a
direct return in the possibility of finding a better job, but it yields an
indirect return in enabling the individual to know better the wage distribu-

with respect to search intensity.
For simplicity, assume the individual is risk neutral, and has perfect infor—
tion

and hence

ination

to make a "better' decision

about the distribution of wages.22 Straightforward calculations verify

that the convexity of the quit rate function depends on the third derivative

of

the search-cost function; clearly there is no necessity for the quit rate

function to be convex even when f is monotonically declining.
The extension of the analysis of Section 2 follows in a straightforward

manner. There is one situation in which a problem does arise: if the search
cost appears as in Figure 6c, then for the highest paying firm s. = 0

the

quit rate function is flat at w = w

wage distribution, it is the degenerate distribution where

all firms pay the

same wage equal to the minimum wage; but this in turn cannot be a zero profit

equilibrium. There exists a non—zero profit equilibrium with all firms paying
w= w 23

Although the cost function depicted in Figure 6c may be considered to be

pathological, and the problems generated are really those associated with the
fixed

cost of search, even in that case there may exist a multiple wage

equilibrium if the non-pecuniary benefits resulting from search are taken
into account, or if individuals differ with respect to their search costs,

An Alternative Formulation. An alternative formulation of our model
has been suggested by Dybvig and Jaynes. Everyone applies to every job, but
obviously accepts only those jobs which offer a higher wage. The firm selects

randomly among the interested applicants. Thus, a firm paying a

NonPecuniary Returns

Jobs differ not only in the wages they pay, but in certain non—pecuniary

characteristics. Some individuals will prefer the characteristics associated
with

one firm, others those associated with another firm. We assume, for

simplicity, that the individual does not know these characteristics until

after completing training, thereupon he knows them fully.26 The value, in

rate, and, if it attempted to reduce its wage, it would increase its turnover rate, even though there are costs of search. There are several interesting

5.3 Non-Optimality of the Natural Rate of Unemployment
The unemployment rate derived in

the

previous section can

be

thought of

as the natural rate of unemployment. This unemployment rate has, however, no

obvious optimality properties. Assume the government worked to maximize
the expected utility of the representative worker; we assuzae, for simplicity,

the government can control wages and the number of jobs (hence U)

that

directly, but that it is constrained to paying wages which break even, i.e.,
(5.10) must be satisfied. The only individuals who are uneiiiployed are the
young (all other individuals

remain at their jobs until they find alternative

employment);3' once they obtain a job they receive a wage of w until they
die. The average present discounted value of their non—pecuniary enjoyment
depends on how frequently individuals quit;

we write 0 = &(q)

Thus, the expected present discounted value of utility of an individual is
represented by

(5.11)

g(U)

where the function g(U) reflects the lowered discounted value of the lifetime stream of utility resulting from the fact that the individual does not

obtain employment immediately. The government wishes to maximize (5.11)

There are several implicit differences between the market and the govern-

ment solutions. First, each firm believes that it can reduce its turnover by
raising its wage relative to others; but of course, when they all try to do
this, this simply raises the wage, reduces the demand for labor, but has no
direct effect on the turnover rate. The reduction in the demand for labor,

is, the increase in unemployment, has, however, an important externality
effect: it reduces turnover at all firms and this lowers aggregate expendithat

ture on training costs, enabling a consequent rise in

wage rate. Though
the firm fails to take into account this benefit of the increased unemployment rate, it also

fails to take into account the increased cost: the poorer

employment.

of the kind of unemployment described in 5.3 or 3.2) remain unemployed for
an expected duration of 1/s. the time to arrive at the next firm.

5.6 Multiple Wage Equilibrium
Thus far, in this section we have shown that with non—pecuniary charac—
teristics of jobs there does not exist a single wage zero profit full employment equilibrium, but there may exist a single wage equilibrium, either with

positive profits or unemployment. A natural question to raise at this juncture
is, can we have a multiple wage zero profit full employment equilibrium; in
other words, do our difficulties arise from the restriction to all firms

paying

the same wage? The answer is no: there do not exist multiple wage

full employment zero profit equilibria either.

Concluding Comments

6.

In this paper we have investigated the implications of imperfect inf or—

mation for the equilibrium wage distribution. We have shown how, even in a
steady state equilibrium, identical labor may receive different wages; the
competitive forces which we normally think of as eliminating such differences

in

34
the long run may not do so when there is imperfect information,

Indeed,

this may be the case even when the only source of "imperfect information't is

there are

from (symmetric) differences in non—

pecuniary characteristics of jobs and preferences of individuals, there will
not in general exist a full employment, zero profit single wage equilibrium.

Perhaps even more significant was the result that in equilibrium, there
could be unemployment; in spite of the presence of an excess supply of labor,
no firm is willing to hire workers at a lower wage, since it knows that if ic
does so, the quit rate will be higher, and hence turnover costs (training
costs) will be higher, so much

model provides a rationale for real wage rigidity. The model, in addi-

tion, provides a theory of frictional unemployment, as workers who are badly
mismatched with firms (in terms of the non—pecuniary characteristics of the
job)

rejoin the unemployment pool to seek a better match.
Though the constrained optitnality (that is, taking explicitly into

account the costs associated with obtaining information and search) may entail
unemployment and wage dispersion, the levels of unemployment and wage disper-

sion in the market equilibrium will not, in general, be optimal. The nature
of the government intervention that is necessary to effect a Pareto improvement is, unfortunately, far from obvious.

FOOTNOTES

1.

In addition, they may or may not know the wage distribution. In later
sections, we shall need to be more explicit about what information individuals have prior to making their search decisions.

2.

If search is costly, individuals will stop short of obtaining "perfect
information," and so price (wage) dispersions might be maintained.

3.

If there were exogenous sources of uncertainty, e.g., technical change,
so that "jobs" have a finite life, then the analysis would be similar
to that contained here.

3a. Since this paper was originally written, a number of other theories of
price or wage distribution have been formulated. Without presenting
a complete survey of what has become an extensive literature, It may be
useful to note a few of the more important strands. In Salop (1977)
and Salop and Stiglitz (1977), the price distribution is used to discriminate among individuals who have different search costs. In earlier
versions of this paper, as well as in Reinganum (1979), firms with different technologies can be shown to pay different wages or charge dif—
ferent prices. In Mortenson (j973Y, costly search prevents labor markets from becoming fully arbitraged in response to disturbances in sub—
markets. (The arguments are analogous to those of Grossman and Stiglitz
(1980) who show that with costly Information, capital markets cannot
become fully arbitraged.) Closest in spirit to this paper are those
studies which have attempted to show that equi1i'brii may be characterized
by a price distribution, even if individuals and firms are identical and
even if there are no exogenous sources of noise (Salop and Stiglitz (1982),
Butters (1977)). While in Butters, stores which charge lower prices are
able to recruit more customers per dollar spent on advertising, in our
model, firms which pay higher wages are able to retain workers for a
longer duration.

Because our model is stochastic, to avoid random variations

In more general versions of this model, to characterize the equilibrium
also need to specify the choice of technique by the firm, the choice
of search intensities by individuals, and the relative prices of different commodities. There are, correspondingly, some additional equilibrium
conditions; e.g., each firm chooses its technique to maximize its profits;
each individual chooses his search intensity (given the wage of the firm
we

he is presently at, the costs of search, and the wage distribution) to
maximize his expected utility.
6.

In Section 5, we assume individuals differ with respect to their evaluation of the non-pecuniary characteristics associated with any firm.
The assumption of identical individuals is made to avoid the possibility
that the equilibrium wage disTtribution is generated by firms' attempting
to act as discriminating monopolists. See Salop and

Stiglitz (1977).

Alternatively, if firms are large, then the number of applicants will
equal the number of deaths; then the firm's production process may involve capital as well as labor. In other cases; that is, for small
firms with capital, after each death or quit there may be a (random)
period of idleness of the machine or the firm may carry an inventory of
underemployed workers. This means that firms must worry about the percentage of time machines which are idle, and individuals may apply to
firms with no vacancies. This complicates but does not basically change
the analysis.

here (as in fact seems to be

the case) that at least some
of the specific training and turnover costs are borne by the firm.

by the firm is endogenously determined) see Arnott and Stiglitz (J983.

a further discussion of the point, see also Stiglitz (1974).

The number of applicants who are willing to accept a job is, of course,
a function of the wage offered, but because of the zero profLt condition,
this has no effect on the wage offered in equilibrium. But see below.

This is consistent, for instance, with each of the large firms having a
number of places to apply, in proportion to the number of jbs which are
available.

minumum wage. Alternatively, w. may be thought of as the reservation
wage, below which individuals will not work. Or w.11 may be thought
of as

the wage which individuals could earn in self—employment. Or there

may be one sector in which there is an organized, competitive labor market
of the conventional sort; individuals know they can obtain employnient in
that sector. Finally, the efficiency wage may provide the minimum wage.
(See fn.

14. These theories are broadly referred to as efficIency wage theories; in
the development literature, they were first discussed by Leibenstein
(1956). While in his theory productivity depended on wages because of
nutrition, subsequent developments by Stiglitz (1976, 1982a, 1982b.),
Weiss (1980), Shapiro and Stiglitz (1982), and Calvo (1979) related productivity to wages through selection (the quality of the applicant pooi
is affected by the wage paid) and incentive effects. For a more extensive
development of the relationship between turnover and unemployment in a
slightly different model, see Stiglitz (1974).

15. We assume throughout this paper—-we would argue realistically——that there
are some turnover costs borne by the firm. A natural question to raise
at this juncture is, if the worker cannot induce the firm to hire him by
lowering his wage, why can't he simply offer to pay a larger fraction
(possibly all) of the turnover costs. There are at least three possible
explanations. First, workers may not have the capital to pay for the
training costs. Second, there is a moral hazard problem on the part of
the firm; it could take the application fee, which is allegedly for
training, and shortly thereafter fire him. Third, those workers who
are willing to pay the most for the job may not be the most productive
(there

are quality—selection effects). The arguments are parallel to

reason

or another, there are some turnover costs borne by

those presented in Stiglitz and Weiss for why an increase in collateral
requirements may not be used to equilibrate the credit market, or in
Shapiro—Stiglitz for why bonding may not eliminate the incentive—
unemployment with which they were concerned.
In any case, all that matters for our analysis is that, for one
the firm.

firms pay the same wage, then if there is any marginal cost to doing any
search, if any single firm raises its wage, it will not induce any
search, and hence will not increase the speed with which it fills vacancies. It is easy to see, more generally, that there may exist equilibria
in which at the highest wage there is a mass point.

From (4.11) we
obtain the search intensity as a function of the wage paid (given the
distribution F(w)).

23.

If the amount of labor each individual supplies is a function of w
(rather than fixed, as in the analysis of the rest of this paper), then
the equilibrium wage will be the monopoly wage, i.e., if L(w) is the
amount of labor an individual supplies as a function of the wage, the
equilibrium wage will be given by the solution to

This corresponds to the result of Diamond (1971), who shows that the
equilibrium in his search model involves a single price at the monopoly
level. But note how dependent it is on the particular ass-rmptions made.

24. We have ignored the possibility that in any period the indiv±ual gets
offered simultaneously two jobs. If the periods are short, so that the
number of vacancies is small relative to the number of applicants, this
is a small probability event; in our continuous time formulation, this
is a zero probability event.

26. There are, of course, some non—pecuniary characteristics which are known
before accepting the job; there will affect the acceptance rate, but not
the quit rate. Similarly, there are pecuniary characteristics, such as
promotion policy, that may become known only gradually to the individual.

If most individuals agree that one firm has more desirable characteristics than another, we can simply add the mean value of U onto the
wage.

28. For simplicity, we revert to our search model of Section 2 where $
fixed. For the more general case, see the 1974 IMSSS version of
"Equilibrium Wage Distributions."

is

29, While in the earlier case, a policy of a constant wage was optimal, it
will not necessarily be so here, since those who remain longer with the
firm

have revealed information about their evaluation of the non—pecuniary
characteristics of the firm; namely, that 8 > 0 . The firm can exploit
that information in designing a seniority wage structure. This is a
difficult problem, the solution to which would not alter the basic qualitative propositions put forth in this section,
Similar considerations suggest that our first order condition (5.7)
is only approximately correct; if the firm chooses a fixed wage rate,
the probability that any individual quits will be a function of the
length of time he has been on the job, i.e., q = q(w,t) .
The present
discounted value of profits of the firm are thus

In our analysis we have replaced (w,t) with q(w,cc) -. Again, the
central result, that for all w > Wmjn

is

when w w* for all firms

still valid.

30. The derivation of the quit rate function from the underlying assumption
on search and non-pecuniary evaluations is tedious; all that is crucial

for our result is that q(w,w*,tJ) < 0

31.

at w =

This assumes that 8mjfl < w* , i.e.,, the non-pecuniary disutility does
not exceed the wage; the modification for the case where some individuals
quit to join the unemployment pool is straightforward..

32. This follows from our strong assumption that individuals value jobs by
w + 8, so there are no income effects in the valuation of non—pecuniary

attributes.
