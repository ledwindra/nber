    "abstract": "\n\nUsing the mass closure of development zones in 2004 as a natural experiment, we examine the causal effect of development zones on firm level TFP in China. The difference-in-difference estimator shows that on average, loss of development zone policies results in 6.5% loss of firms\u2019 TFP. Locational heterogeneity is important.  Within 500 kilometers from the three major seaports in China, closure of zones reduced firm-level TFP by 9.62%, whereas closure of zones farther away did not show significant effects. Market potential and local within-industry spillover effects can explain much of this locational heterogeneity.  We conclude that China\u2019s strategy of using development zones as a place-based policy to encourage inland development may have led to spatial misallocation.\n\n",
