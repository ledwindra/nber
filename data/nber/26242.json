    "abstract": "\n\nFathers' multiple-partner fertility (MPF) is associated with substantially worse educational outcomes for children.  We focus on children in fathers\u2019 \u201csecond families\u201d when the second families are nuclear families \u2013 households consisting of a man, a woman, their joint children, and no other children.  We analyze outcomes for almost 75,000 Norwegian children all of whom, at least until they were age 18, lived in nuclear families. Children with MPF fathers are more likely than other children from nuclear families to drop out of secondary school (24% vs 17%) and less likely to obtain bachelor\u2019s degrees (44% vs 51%). These gaps remain substantial after controlling for child and parental characteristics such as income and wealth, education and age: 4 percentage points (ppt) for dropping out of secondary school and 5 ppt for obtaining a bachelor\u2019s degree. Resource competition with the children in the father\u2019s first family does not explain the differences in educational outcomes. We find that the association between a father\u2019s previous childless marriage and his children\u2019s educational outcomes is similar to the association between a father\u2019s MPF and his children\u2019s educational outcomes. This similarity suggests that selection plays the primary role in explaining the association between fathers' MPF and children's educational outcomes.\n\n",
