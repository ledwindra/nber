TREASURY BILL RATES IN THE 1970s AND 1980s

ABSTRACT

is widely recognized, real interest rates in the early 1980s were at
peaks not witnessed since the late 1920s. Less well perceived is the sharp
decline in real interest rates since 1984. By 1986—88, real interest rates
were back at their average levels of the previous quarter century. This paper

six—month Treasury bill rates.

The rise in real interest rates between the middle 1970s and early 1980s,

not surprisingly, results from a variety of factors. First, rates were
unusually low in the middle 1970s owing to the first OPEC shock, which lowered
investment demand and increased world saving by transferring wealth from the
high—consuming developed countries to OPEC. Second. tight money, high
inflation, and hel ghtened nucl ear fear all contributed to real rates becoming
unusually high in the early 1980s. The eventual decline of OPEC surpluses
following the second OPEC shock prolonged the period of high real rates. The
decline in real rates to more normal levels in the 1986—88 period is also due

to multiple factors:

lower inflation, declining marginal tax rates, and easy

monetary policy.

As is well known, real interest rates in the early 1980s were at peaks not
witnessed since the late 1920s (Clarida and Friedman, 1983; Hendershott,
1986).

These rates have generally been attributed to tight monetary policy

(Clarida and Friedman), easy fiscal policy (Feldstein, 1985), or a combination
of the two (Blanchard and Suriiiiers, 1984. and their discussants).

Changes in

private saving and investment propensities have been given secondary billing.

Less well known is the sharp decline in real interest rates after 1984.
Movements in pretax and after—tax ex ante real six—month Treasury bill

rates are shown in Figure

1.1

The high pretax real rates in the 1981—85

period are obvious, as are the subsequent lower rates since then.2 Equally

obvious are the low real rates in the middle l97O. These low rates might
cause one to view recent real rates as still being high.

In fact, though, the

average real bill rate in the 1986—88 period exactly equals the real rate over
the last three decades. On an after—tax basis, the low 1970s rates stand out
far more than the high 1980s rates.

After—tax real rates were more than a

full percentage point below zero throughout the 1974—80 period, while
after—tax rates in the 1981—85 period were hardly above their average value

for the 1960s.

Finally, Figure

1

suggests a strong cyclical pattern in real

rates, with the pretax real rate rising by two to three percentage points from
trough to peak over each business cycle (the last cycle being a possible
exception).4

This paper seeks to identify the underlying determinants of the major
movements in these real bill rates.

Our innovations to the "standard's

pre—1980s model are the addition of a new private saving shifter (Slemrods

nuclear fear variable) and lagged values of all variables in the economy s

rates in the 1980s to tight monetary policy do so by default —— it must be
monetary policy because nothing else seems to explain the high rates —— rather

than by relating interest rates to a measure of monetary tightness or ease.
The same factors explain the surge in the early 1980s and the subsequent

decline in both before—tax and after—tax real interest rates.

The erosion of

the second OPEC shock, a tightening of monetary policy, a nuclear—fear—induced

decline in the propensity to save, and an increase in expected inflation all

contributed to the jump in real rates in the early 1980s. The decline in real
rates since then is due to a decline in expected inflation and the longest
period of monetary ease in the last thirty years.

This paper is divided into four parts.

The model is presented in Section

I, and the empirical estimates are reported in Section II.

An interpretation

of the major shifts in real bill rates, both before— and after—tax, is
presented in Section III, and our findings are summarized in Section IV.
I. Derivation of the Estimation Equation

The initial interest—rate model is based on a relatively simple
specification of IS and LH equations.

The goods and money market equilibria

can be expressed as

Real expenditures depend on the after—tax real interest rate defined as the

—2—

after—tax nominal rate less the expected inflation rate (i*_lr),

the

real GNP

gap (GAP), the full—employment federal budget deficit (DEF), OPEC supply

shocks (OPEC), and a private saving shifter (PSAV).

Real money demand depends

on real income (Y), the after—tax nominal interest rate (j*), and asset demand
shifts associated with the OPEC shocks.

The presumed partial derivatives of

the expenditure and money demand functions with respect to these arguments are

indicated in parentheses.

The after—tax nominal interest rate is simply

(l—t)i, where t is the marginal tax rate on interest income and

i

is the

pretax nom1na rate.
Many of the hypothesized responses of planned expenditures in the IS and

LM equations are straightforward.

Money demand rises with increases in income

and falls with an increase in the opportunity cost of holding money, the
after—tax nominal interest rate.

Increases in the after—tax real interest

rate and the real GNP gap (defined as potential minus actual real GNP, divided
by potential real GNP) are each hypothesized to reduce real expenditures,

while an increase in the full—employment federal budget deficit is
hypothesized to increase real expenditures.5
The OPEC oil shocks shift both the IS and LM curves.

An increase in the

relative price of energy would reduce the demand for capital, and hence
investment, and thus lower the IS curve (Wilcox, 1983).

Such a shock also

would transfer real income to oil—exporting countries.

If these countries

desire to maintain a higher proportion of their wealth portfolios in U.S.
financial assets than did those who lost wealth (Japan, Europe and the U.S.),
the LM curve will shift downward.

Furthermore, because the marginal

propensity to save of the oi exporting countries exceeded (at 'east

initially) that of the rest of the world, world saving increased (Sachs, 1981;
Peek and Wilcox, 1983).

This would lower the IS curve to the extent that a

part of the associated decline in aggregate world expenditures represents a
—3—

reduction in expenditures on U.S. goods and services.

The private saving shifter is based on Slemrod's (1986) hypothesis that
heightened fear of nuclear war reduces 'private saving.

If war is considered

imminent, the return to saving is a large negative number.

His proxy for

nuclear fear is the minutes—to—midnight series published monthly by Ih

Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. The fewer are the minutes left till
midnight, the closer is war, the lower is the incentive to save, and the
higher would real interest rates be.
Assuming continuous equilibrium in financial and goods markets, equations

(1) and (2) can be combined in a straightforward manner to yield a
reduced—form equation for the after—tax nominal interest rate:

nominal after—tax interest rate would be expected to rise with increases

in the expected inflation rate (but by less than percentage point for
percentage point) and the full—employment budget deficit.

Increases in the

GNP gap, the real money supply, real oil prices, and the propensity of private

citizens to save would lead to lower interest rates.
Because financial markets adjust quickly, the economy can plausibly be
assumed to be continuously on the LM curve.

However, temporary disequilibrium

in the goods market can result In the economy being off the long—run IS
curve.

As a result, shifts in either the IS or LH schedule do not immediately

move the economy to the new (i*,Y) equilibrium (Horwich, 1964, pp. 525—528).

An outward shift of the IS curve moves the economy gradually (along the LM

curve) to the higher interest ratelincome equilibrium.
the IS shifters should enter equation (3).

Thus, lagged values of

For example, an

with little change in income and then to rise (along the new LM

curve) with income to the new equilibrium.
The overshOot and reversal can be captured by including the difference
between the current growth rate of the money supply and its recent average
growth rate (MACC) as a regressor in equation (3) (Peek and Hilcox, 1986).

If

this accelerated growth rate is maintained, MACC gradually reverts to zero and

the overshooting of the interest rate decline is eliminated. He would expect
the coefficient on MACC to be negative.

Bill Rate Equations
A. The Basic Data

The interest rate equation estimates are based on semiannual observations

corresponding to the frequency of the Livingston survey data on expected

inflation rates. April and October monthly averages of daily secondary market
six—month Treasury bill rates are taken from the Federal Reserve Bulletin and
have been converted from a discount basis to a bond—equivalent yield.

The

first available observation is for April 1959 (denoted 1959:04, April being
the fourth month), and our first set of equations is estimated through the
April 1979 observation.

The six—month Livingston expected inflation rate

series was provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.6

This

measure of expected inflation has two advantages over mechanical formulations:

it is a truly ex ante expectation, and it reflects whatever sophistication
agents use to process information.

The tax rate on interest income is an

average marginal tax rate constructed from data contained in annual editions
of Statistics of Income. Individual Income Tax Returns as described in Peek
and Hilcox (1983).

The tax rate used for the October observation is an
—5—

average of the rate for the current year and the subsequent year.
The GNP gap (GAP) is based on the middle—expansion trend real GNP series

calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

GAP is computed as

middle—expansion GNP minus actual real GNP, divided by middle—expansion GNP.

The average value of the first— and previous fourth—quarter observations of

GAP is used to correspond to the April interest rate data.

The average of

second— and third—quarter values of GAP corresponds to the October

observation.

The fiscal poflcy proxy (DEE) is the cycflcafly—adjusted federal

budget deficit as a percentage of middle—expansion GNP and is based on the

series constructed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.7 The appropriate

measure is the expected cyclically—adjusted deficit, and the expectation
should be over the same time span as covered by the interest rate.

Because

the dependent variable is a six—month interest rate, the average of the
cyclically—adjusted federal budget deficit measure for the quarter beginning
in April (or October) and the subsequent quarter is used.

The use of the

actual values of the cyclically—adjusted deficit measure as a proxy for its
expected value makes an implicit rational expectations assumption.
The OPEC proxy is measured as the current account surplus of oil exporting

countries, taken from International Financial Statistics, divided by
middle—expansion GNP.

Following the two sharp oil price increases in the

1970s, oil—exporting countries did not imediately purchase imports with their
rapidly growing export receipts, causing a temporary surge in their current
account surplus.

Because this surplus is highly correlated with the relative

price of oil, it is also employed as a proxy for the OPEC relative price
effect in the model.

The real money stock, M/P, is ca'culated as the narrowly

defined nominal money supply (Ml) divided by the GNP price deflator for the

quarter imediately preceding the interest rate observation (ie., first— and
third—quarter values).

MACC is calculated as the growth rate of nominal Ml
—6—

during the previous six months relative to its growth rate during the previous
three years (as in Wilcox, 1983).
The natural logarithm of the average of minutes to midnight for the

preceding quarter is used as our proxy for the private propensity to save.
This variable is denoted as PSAV and has a negative expected sign in the

interest rate equation.8 Hendershott and Peek (1989) have found some
support for this hypothesis from U.S. saving data.

In a multicountry study,

Slemrod (1989) has found a role for a related variable.

Preliminary Estimation

(for example, Wilcox, 1983).

Row 1

contains the results for the

All of the explanatory variables have the predicted

sign with the exception of M/P and DEF. and all except the OPEC shock variable

are statistically significant. The positive coefficient on M/P is consistent
with the findings of much of the previous empirical literature (e.g., Peek and
Wilcox, 1983) and could be caused by the money demand puzzles of the 1970s.

Similarly, the negative estimated coefficient of DEF is not surprising,
although its significance level is, given the mixed evidence from previous
studies (for example, Evans 1985, Makin 1983, Congressional Budget Office

1984) and the problems associated with our empirical measure (see footnotes 5
and 7).

This specification (with or without M/P and DEF) does an excellent job of
explaining movements in the after—tax bill rate for the 1959—1979 period.

However, the specification (again with or without M/P and DEF) is unable to

forecast the sharp rise in after—tax real interest rates in the early 1980s.
The actual after—tax real interest rate and the corresponding

fitted/forecasted rate using the row 1 estimates are plotted in Figure 2.
—7—

Although the difference between these two series never exceeds one percentage

point through mid—1979, it jumps to 2.5 percentage points in late 1980, to 5.5
percentage points in early 1982, and does not fall below 2 percentage points

until 1986.
Further evidence of the breakdown of the relationship when the 1980s are

included is given in row 2 of Table 1.

When the sample period is extended

equation, as well as from the fitted/forecasted series from the row 1
estimates.

While the full—sample equation obviously fits the 1980s better,

the improved fit comes at the expense of the second half of the 1970s where

the equation overpredicts those low rates by over a percentage point on
average.

The last row in Table

1

includes both our new proxy for changes in the

propensity to save and lagged values of all the IS shifters.

The nuclear fear

variable contributes marginally, and all five lagged explanatory variables
have the expected sign, with the coefficients on both expected inflation and
OPEC shocks being statistically significant.

Overall, the equation standard

error is cut by nearly 20 percent and the Durbin—Watson statistic rises above
1.0.

Nonetheless, numerous problems exist with this equation: current values

of many variables have little impact, significant autocorrelation of the
residuals is evident, and the equation standard error is over three—quarters
of a percentage point.

Based on these estimates, restrictive monetary policy

contributes less than 25 basis points to the sharp increase in real interest
rates in the early 1980s, a surprisingly small role given the widespread

attribution of high 1980s interest rates to a restrictive monetary policy.

C.

Measures of Monetary Policy

The creation of new deposit interest accounts and the deregulation of

deposit interest rate ceilings in the late 1970s and early 1980s distorted
measures of the money supply and shifted the money demand function (Simpson.
1984).

Much evidence suggests that the impacts of M/P and MACC might be

different in the 1980s than in the 1970s (see, for example, Friedman 1988).
Moreover, the information contained in these measures might need to be
supplemented to account for the shifting relationship between money demand and

any particular measure of the money supply.

Our alternative proxy for the stance of monetary policy is based on the
behavior of the six—month Treasury bill rate, which the Federal Reserve can

control over short periods, relative to that of the five—year Treasury bond
rate, over which the Federal Reserve has decidedly less control.

In general,

one might posit the slope of the term structure (R6/R6O the ratio of the six—
to the sixty—month Treasury rates) to be a function of the slope of the

inflation rate structure (ir6/ir6O. the ratio of the six— to the sixty—month
expected inflation rates), the current full—employment Federal deficit (DEF)

relative to the expected long—run deficit (DEF6O), cyclical factors causing
short— and long—term real rates to differ (GAP), and monetary policy.

We

anticipate that a large current deficit relative to outyear deficits would
raise short—term rates relative to longer—term rates, as would a strong
current economy.

Because we are interested in the impact of monetary policy on the

six—month interest rate, it is useful to write:

function

In the actual estimation of (5), standard monetary

variables (a component of MP) would be included in the equation along with the
arguments in & HP would then be measured as the estimated contribution of

the monetary variables and the equations residual.

For the rate ratio, we use the six—month bill rate divided by the
five—year rate, both on a bond—equivalent basis, for April and October of each
year.

The five—year rate is the constant maturity series from the Federal

Reserve Bulletin.10

Unfortunately, a five—year expected inflation rate is

unavailable, but a one—year rate is obtainable from the Livingston survey.
Thus we use the six—month to one—year expected Inflation ratio, ,r61,r12, as

a proxy for

We also include as regressors GAP for the current

w6/ir60.11

and previous period, proxies for the expected full—employment deficits over

the life of the six—month Treasury bill and over the life of the five—year
bond, and H/P and MACC.

Empirically, we proxy the expected future deficit variables by the actual

deficits during the six months the bill will exist (DEF) and the two years
beyond that (DEF24).

A two—year rather than five—year horizon is employed

because actual future deficits are unavailable for the final observations in
our sample and must be projected.

A further consideration is that the longer

the horizon, the less likely actual deficits serve as an adequate proxy for
expected deficits due to major unanticipated changes in fiscal policy. This
is particularly important for the sequence of tax law changes in the 1980s,
some of which reversed the thrust of prior changes.

For the same reason,

projections of future deficits based upon todays tax law and expenditure
programs are likely to be inappropriate.

Table 2 presents the results for alternative specifications of the rate
ratio equation.

The equations in the first two rows are estimated only
—10—

through April 1979 to avoid possible contamination of the estimated
coefficients by the changing monetary relationships associated with the
October 1979 change in Federal Reserve operating procedures and the

acceleration of the ongoing financial deregulation and innovation in the early
l980s.

In the first equation, M/P and both deficit measures have estimated

coefficients with signs opposite those predicted, although the M/P coefficient

is not significant.

The signs on the deficit variables are puzzling.

They

may be related to general problems with the deficit measure (see footnotes 5
and 7).

Alternatively, recessions might cause both low rate ratios (an upward

sloping yield curve) and a relaxation of current fiscal policy (high DEF
relative to DEF24).

In any event, the deficit variables are certainly not

causing the rate ratio to move as the coefficients indicate.

Thus, we

reestimate the first equation omitting M/P, DEF and DEF24 (row 2).

All of the
estimated coefficients are statistically significant, with the exception of
GAP1.

The ir6/irl2 coefficient is smaller than anticipated, perhaps

reflecting the use of ir6/irl2 in place of ir6/ir6O.
Rows 3 and 4 contain the estimates for the full 1959:04 — 88:10

period.

To allow for a changing impact of Ml in the l980s owing to deregulation, M/P
and MACC are entered for the entire period and again for the l980s only (M/P80
and MACC8O are equal to M/P and MACC during the 1979:10 — 88:10 subperiod and

zero otherwise).

M/P and MACC both have the predicted negative signs; the

positive and statistically significant M/P80 and MACC8O coefficents indicate

reduced impact on the rate ratio in the 98Os.

This would be consistent with

our hypothesis of a deteriorating relationship between measures of Ml and

other economic variables (including interest rates). GAP1 now has a
t—statistic of only about 0.25.

The deficit variables again have

statistically significant coefficients with signs opposite those predicted.

The ii-6hr12 coefficient is now much larger.

Row 4 presents a reestimation

of this equation omitting GAP1, DEF and DEF24.

All of the estimated

coefficients are now statistically significant and of the predicted sign.

All

the equations exhibit significant autocorrelation of the residuals, suggesting
that an important explanatory variable has been omitted.

This is exactly as

expected, the important variable presumably being monetary policy effects not
captured by the included monetary variables.
We have constructed monetary policy proxies based on the estimates in rows
2 and 4.

SubstitutIng the first four terms of row 2 (three terms of row 4)

into equation (6) for 4(), we can compute the HP series for the entire
1959:04—88:10 period.

Thus the alternative proxy for the stance of monetary

policy is composed of the movement in R6/R60 "explained

by the monetary

variables plus the residual from the estimated equation.'2

The two HP

The H/P variable has been

multiplied by minus one so that it should correlate positively with Interest
rates.

The HP variables appear to be more reasonable proxies for shifts in
monetary policy than H/P even before the 1980s.

The easing of monetary policy

after the 1966 credit crunch, the subsequent tightening leading to the 1969
credit crunch, and the return to monetary ease are all more apparent.
Although both HP and H/P show a tightening in the early 1970s,

the subsequent

easing of policy and return to a tighter monetary policy are again more
striking with HP than with H/P.

Finally, both series indicate a dramatic

easing of monetary policy In 1983.
The two HP measures move similarly and thus perform similarly in
regressions.

We report results using the MP variable based upon the pre—1980s

data in order to avoid any contamination of the estimated coefficients used to
construct the monetary policy variable owing to the changing financial

the equation by dropping the M/P variable and the lagged value of

The remaining

between 0.87 and 0.96) between the pairs of current and lagged values of
explanatory variables.
Row 4 reports the estimates with a Cochrane—Orcutt adjustment for auto—

These estimates shift half of the

lagged—inflation effect to current inflation, while reducing the lagged—OPEC
impact.13

The most important changes, though, relate to the private saving

shifter —— fear of nuclear war —— and federal saving (the deficit).

The row 4

estimates allocate a greater impact to changes in nuclear fear, and the

current full—employment deficit now has a negative, but statistically

insignificant, coefficient.

In effect, these estimates attribute more of the

high 1980s real rates to reduced private saving and less to reduced federal

To this point we have said nothing about foreign monetary or fiscal

policy.

To test for the impact of these factors, we obtained estimates of the

OECD full—employment deficit and computed a weighted average monetary

acceleration variable for the OECD countries)4 Because we could only
obtain this data for the 1970—87 period, we estimated an equation for this

period including these variables and all those appearing in row 3.

The

coefficients on foreign variables had t—ratios less than 0.7 and that for the
foreign deficit was unexpectedly negative. This suggests that foreign fiscal
and monetary policies have not had a major impact on U.S. Treasury bill rates.

Figure 5 illustrates how closely the row 3 estimates track the observed

real after—tax bill rate.

Both the decline throughout the 1970s and the jump

in the early 1980s are generally explained, as are the major variations in the
1960s and the decline in the second half of the 1980s.

The fitted rate is

over a percentage point too high in only two 1970s observations and over a

percentage point too low for only two observations in the 1980s.

The row 3

estimates are used in the next section of the paper to explain the major

shifts in the real after—tax and pretax bill rates over the last three decades.
Much of the previous empirical literature has focused on the pretax,

rather than the after—tax, real interest rate.

For this reason, we have

reestimated the third and fourth equations in Table 3, setting t • 0.

These

estimates, reported in rows 5 and 6, tell much the same story as their
after—tax counterparts (given that the dependent variable is roughly 40
percent greater in rows 5 and 6, the coefficients would be expected to be
comparably larger than those in rows 3 and 4).

occur in the row 5 analogue to row 3.

Two significant deviations

First, the current federal deficit

coefficient is less than that in row 3 and is barely greater than half its
standard error (the lagged value had a negative and very insignificant
—14—

coefficient and was thus omitted from the equation).

Second, the sum of the

coefficients on expected inflation are 60 percent greater. Thus an increase

in inflation will raise real rates more according to row 5 than to row 3.
Following Peek and Wilcox (1984), we specify the after—tax nominal

interest rate as (l—et)i and obtain an equation explaining the pretax

nominal interest rate by dividing all explanatory variables in equation (4) by
(1—et).

For the equation corresponding to row 3, the estimated value of e

was 1.10 with a standard error of 0.45.

We take this as evidence that the

after—tax, rather than the pretax, Treasury bill rate is determined in
financial markets.

Nonetheless, for comparison purposes we use both the

after—tax and pretax interest rate equations in our analysis of major shifts

In the pretax real rate.
III. Determinants of Major Shifts in Real Bill Rates
After—tax real rates have varied widely over the 1959—88 period, falling
from 1.5 percent in the 1960s to —1.75 percent in the middle and late 1970s,

Jumping to 2.25 percent in the early 1980s, and then receding to 0.95 percent
during the 1986—88 period.

Pretax real six—month Treasury bill rates averaged

2.6 percent during the entire 1959—88 period.

Moreover, they averaged 2.7

percent during the initial 1959—70 years and 2.5 percent over the last six
observations (86:04—88:10).

In the intervening years, however, real rates

swung violently, averaging only 0.2 percent in the middle 1970s but then
rising to 2.0 percent in 1979—80 and 5.5 percent in 1981—84.

This section

unravels the contributions of our explanatory variables to these wide swings

in real rates.
A. After—Tax Real Rates

The first row of Table 4 contains average rates for the real after—tax
six—month Treasury bill rate at each of the peak and trough periods mentioned
above.

Row 2 lists the change in the after—tax real rate between these
—15—

periods.

The remaining rows contain the contributions of changes in monetary

policy (MP and MACC), fiscal policy (DEF), saving (PSAV and OPEC), the

business cycle (GAP) and expected inflation (ir) to the changes in the real
after—tax rate.
row 3 of Table 3.

These contributions are based on the coefficient estimates in
The impact of expected inflation arises largely because the

sum of the coefficients on ir and ir1 is less than unity (higher expected

inflation lowers the after—tax real rate).
The decline in the after—tax real rate from the 1960s to the mid—1970s is

attributable to three factors, increases in private saving and expected
inflation and, to a lesser extent, a weakening of the economy.

All of these

were, in fact, largely due to the same single cause: the first OPEC shock.
Monetary policy played no role in the decrease.

This interpretation is

consistent with I'lilcox (1983).

The real after—tax rate fell further in 1979—80, in spite of a sharply
restrictive monetary policy and a strong economy, owing to the sharp rise in

inflation.

(Because both subperiods immediately follow oil shocks, the OPEC

saving shifter played a much less important role.)

After—tax real rates then

jumped by over 4 percentage points in 1981—84, not due to a further tightening

of monetary policy, but rather to the decrease in expected inflation and a
decrease in private saving.

Eighty percent of the latter is attributable to

the unwinding of the second oil shock (as OPEC surpluses dissipated) and 20

percent to the heightened fear of nuclear war.

In fact most of the increase

in real rates from the lows in the middle of the 1970s to 1981—84 might be
traced to a single cause, the second OPEC shock.

The resultant acceleration

in inflation caused the restrictive monetary policy, contributed to the
election of Ronald Reagan (not only was inflation high and rising, but the
spring 1980 inflation numbers led Jimy Carter to impose consumer credit

controls, which triggered the 1980 recession), and led to the disinflation.
—16—

The election of Reagan, with his "evil empire" speeches, was likely the cause

of the heightened fear of nuclear war.

Nearly a percentage point of the peak

after—tax real rate is not explained, however.

The decline in after—tax real rates from their peak can also likely be

linked to a change in inflation, this time a decline, which led to an easier
A strong economy acted to cushion the decline.

monetary policy.

The failure

to explain fully the high 1981—83 after—tax real rate also shows up here in

the contribution of unidentified factors of roughly equal (but opposite
signed) magnitude.

The subperiods in Table 4 were chosen based on values of the real

after—tax interest rate.

However, major shifts in the contributing factors

can occur within subperiods, and thus changes in the subperlod averages in the
Table can understate the importance of short—term movements in the

contributions.

For example, because monetary policy was still tight at the

beginning of the 1974—78 subperiod before easing substantially in 1976, the

table understates the shift in monetary policy from 1976—77 to the early
1980s.

By our measure, monetary policy raised real after—tax interest rates

by 140 basis points between its low point in 1976:04—77:04 and
1979:04—1980:10.

This translates into a two percentage point increase in the

pretax real rate.
B. Pretax Real Rates

Table 5 is similar to Table 4 except that changes in the pretax real
six—month bill rate are now being attributed to our explanatory variables.
The periods correspond to those in Table 4 except for single half—year shifts

in the starting/ending dates to correspond more closely to observed interest
rate peaks and troughs.

The contributions of the variables are calculated in

two ways, using the coefficient estimates in rows 3 (after—tax bill rate
equation) and 5 (pretax equation) of Table 3.
—17—

The unwinding of the after—tax

equation allows the tax rate contribution to be isolated and included with DEF

n the flscal policy category)5 Imp1icatons of the row 3 estimates are
listed first in the table; implications from row 5 are reported in parentheses.
As can be seen, the two sets of coefficient estimates attribute roughly
equal impacts to monetary policy, saving shifts, and the business cycle.

They

obvousy give different impacts for fisca' policy, with the f1sca poflcy
contribution from the after—tax equation reflecting the impact of bracket
creep in the 1960s and 1970s mitigating the decline in real rates and the

substantial tax rate reductions in the 1980s first holding back real rate
increases and then making an important contribution to their decline.

Differences in the inflation impact and in the residual (unidentified factors)

offset the differences in the fiscal policy impact.
The decline in the real rate from the 1960s to the mid—1970s is less than

the decline in the after—tax rate because the increase in expected inflation

does not act to lower the pretax rate;
(divided by

1

the sum of the coefficients on ir and

— t in the after—tax equation) exceeds unity.16

This

leaves an increase in saving and a weakening of the economy as the only

factors contributing to the reduction in real rates.
The rise in the real rate to more normal levels in 1979—80 was due

primarily to a restrictive monetary policy and a strong economy.

The further

jump to extraordinarily high real rates in 1981—84 was not due to a further

tightening of monetary policy, but rather to a sharp decrease in private
saving and to changing inflation.

As was the case with after—tax rates, most

of the increase in real rates from the lows in the middle of the 1970s to the
highs in 1981—84 can be attributed to the direct and indirect effects of the
second OPEC shock.

Much of the decline in pretax real rates from their peak can, like the

decline in after—tax rates, be tied to a decline in inflation and the
—18—

resultant easing of monetary policy.

In addition, in the after—tax model a

cut in tax rates also plays an Important role, alone accounting for a full
percentage point of the decline in pretax real rates between 1981—84 and
1986—88.

IV. Sumary

We have attempted to uncover the sources of the major changes in real

Treasury bill rates, both before— and after—tax, since the middle 1970s.
major changes have occurred in both before— and after—tax real rates

in the early 1980s and a partial reversal since then.
rates do not always move together.

Two

—— a jump

But pre— and post—tax

Most clearly, pretax real rates rose by

nearly two percentage points from the mid—1970s to 1979—80, while after—tax

rates fell by another half percentage point before leaping in 1981—82.
Differences in the movements in these rates stem from different responses

to changes in tax rates and expected inflation.

If financial markets

determine after—tax rates as our model suggests, these rates are independent

of changes in tax rates; a reduction in the tax rate causes the pretax rate to
rise sufficiently to leave the after—tax rate unchanged.

Thus bracket creep

in the 1960s and 1970s tended to put upward pressure on pretax real rates

while the large tax rate reductions in the 1980s made an important

contribution to the recent decline in real rates.

The impact of changes in

expected inflation is more complicated. We estimate the long—run response of

the after-tax nomina' rate to expected inflation (Si*/Sir)

to

be 0.80.

The response of the after—tax real rate to a single percentage point increase

in expected inflation is thus 0.80 —
pretax real rate is 6(i—ir)/&tr

•

— —0.20.

Because the response of the

0.80/(1 — t) and t has varied from

0.24 to 0.34. the pretax real rate response has varied from 0.05 to 0.21.
However, in the short run the response is negative because most of the
—19—

response of nominal rates to increases in expected inflation occurs with a
one—period lag.

The other variables estimated to affect real interest rates significant'y
are monetary policy, the propensity to save (influenced by OPEC shocks and the

fear of nuclear war), and the strength of economic activity.

Changes in each

of these affect pre— and post—tax rates the same way, 1though the impacts on

pretax rates are about 40 percent greater than those on after—tax rates.
Swings in monetary policy have altered pretax real rates by as much as two

percentage points; cyclical changes in real activity have moved pretax rates
by a percentage point; and changes in the propensity to save have changed

pretax rates by over two and a half percentage points.

Movements in the

full—employment deficit, in contrast, are estimated to affect interest rates

little.
Our principal conclusion is that the emphasis on the high real interest
rates in the early 1980s is overdone.

The key to understanding real interest

rates in the last quarter century is the extraordinarily low interest rates in
much of the 1970s owing to the two OPEC ofl shocks, which lowered investment

demand and increased world saving by transferring wealth from the
high—consuming developed countries to OPEC.

Tight money, high inflation, and

heightened nuclear fear all contributed to the subsequent sharp rise in real
rates, with the eventual decline of OPEC surpluses following the second OPEC

shock prolonging this period of higher real rates. Hhile changes in monetary
policy explain both the rebound in real rates to normal levels in the 1978—80
period and much of the decline since 1984, by our estimates monetary policy
does not account for the jump in real rates between 1978—80 and 1981—84.

Monetary policy was not noticeably tighter in the early 1980s than in the
1973—74 period, although the period of tightness, mid—1979 to mid—1983, lasted
much 1nger.

Simflarly, the recent period of ease has been longer than any in
—20—

the last quarter—century.

Fiscal policy, on the other hand, had little impact

on real interest rates in the early 1980s, with decreasing marginal tax rates

offsetting the effects of increasing structural deficits.

was accompanied by a decline in real rates.

45—46) and the references cited therein.
5Changes in government expenditures are often hypothesized to have a larger
impact on aggregate demand than changes in tax revenues (the balanced—budget

multiplier argument).

On the other hand, to the extent government purchases

are good substitutes for privately purchased goods, the impact on aggregate
demand of government expendItures would be partIally offset by a corresponding

reduction in private expenditures.

In some instances, changes in tax revenues
—22—

financed by changes in government bonds outstanding are hypothesized to have
no impact on aggregate demand (Barro, 1974).

Because the additional interest

payments on the newly issued government bonds represent expected future tax

liabilities with a present discounted value equal to the reduction in current
taxes, individuals would view the changes in current and future taxes as
equivalent and not alter their planned expenditures (Ricardian equivalence).

On the other hand, to the extent that individuals are liquidity constrained,
their marginal propensity to consume out of disposable income would approach

unity.

In that instance, tax changes could have substantial effects on

aggregate demand.

6The Livingston survey data actually represent eight— and fourteen—month

rather than six— and twelve—month inflation expectations.

For example, in

approximately early May, respondents are asked to provide their expectation of
the level of the Consumer Price Index for December and for June of the

following year.

The last reported CPI data would be for April.

Thus, the

calculated implicit inflation rate would be for April to December and for

April to June of the following year.

The timing of the interest rate data has

been selected to correspond with the approximate date at which respondents

form their expectations.

7This proxy for fiscal policy effects presents a number of problems, as do
alternative measures.

On general measurement issues, see, for example, Eisner

(1986) and Kotllkoff (1986).
8An increase in minutes to midnight would also raise investment and thus

interest rates.

However, the saving effect should dominate because life—cycle

however, we have not included the credit controls dummy variables in the

10We used the five— rather than ten— or twenty—year Treasury rates for two
reasons.

First, the data on longer—term Treasuries are contaminated because

only deep discount bonds existed between 1966 and 1975 (Cook and Hendershott,
1978).

Second, only short—term expected inflation series are available prior

to 1980.
