Introduction

European countries with relatively generous unemployment
insurance (UI)

systems (such as Belgium, France, Germany, the

Netherlands, and the United Kingdom) have suffered much larger and
more persistent

increases in unemployment in the 1980's than the

United States.

These differences in European and U.S. unemployment

experience are largely explained by the substantially
of unemployment spells in Europe.

longer duration

Furthermore, much microeconomic

evidence indicates that there is a positive relation between the
level of UI benefits received and the duration of the unemployment
spells of UI recipients.1

These observations have generated much

interest among hoth academics (e.g. Minford, 1985) and the press
(e.g. The Economist,

14-20 May 1988,

p.69) in the hypnthesis that

work disincentives arising from generous unemployment insurance (UI)
systems play an important role in high and persistent European
unemployment in the 1980's.
Burda (1988) provides some suggestive evidence that differences
in the generosity

of UT systems may help explain cross-country

differences in unemployment performance.

benefits had much lower unemployment than the less generous U.S. in
ihe 1960's.

Still, typical unemployment spell durations have tended

to he quite long in economies with liberal UI systems even in petiods
of relatively low unemployment.

A key issue prior to the debate over

the impacts of UI system generosity on aggregate unemployment

is

whether there is microeconomic evidence consistent with the key link
in the macroeconomic

argument that observed differences in UI systems

csn help explain substantial cross-country differences in the
duration of unemployment.
In comparing the UI system in the U.S. with those in Europe, the
major differences appear to be in the potential duration of benefits
and eligibility requirements for benefits rather than in the weekly
benefits level for qualified workers.

In particular, insurance and

other assistsnce lasts for more than twice as long in most European
countries than in the United States.

benefits varies dramatically across countries.

workers with current spells of 12 months or longer. The UI measure
constructed by Burda combines information on the level of benefits,
average manufacturing earnings, and the maximum duration of benefits.
Burds's measure is the present discounted value (using a 10 percent
discount rate) of the maximum number of weeks of benefits available
to an insured worker relative to the average weekly earnings for a
manufacturing worker. This measure ignores taxes and substantial
differences across countries in eligibility requirements for UI.
These differences in eligibility rules generate substantial variation
in the fraction of the unemployed covered by UI across countries.

In fact, benefita can laat indefinitely (at a reduced rate after the
firat year) for aome individuala in Belgium and the United Kingdom
(Eaeraon, 1988).

UI benefita that laat for a long duration combined

with limited monitoring of aearch effort may make an economy more
ausceptible to increaaea in long-term unemployment in the face of

While much microeconomic reaearch haa ahown that higher levela of

The second part of out empirical work examines the impact of the
level and length of UI benefits on the escape tate from unemployment
for a large sample of UI recipients.

This Continuous Wage and

Benefit History (CWBH) data set, extracted by Hoffitt (1985a), has
the advantage of providing detailed administrative records on the UI

system parameters facing individuals.

Since the data set covets

This variation allows us to directly estimate impacts on

the escape rate from unemployment of differences

in the level and

length of benefits and test the predictions of alternative models.

We utilize these estimates to simulate the impact of changes in the
level and maximum duration of benefits on the mean duration of
unemployment, the fraction of workers exhausting benefits, and
expected expenditure on UI benefits per compensated unemployment
spell.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Section II

reviews several alternative theoretical models of the effects of UI
system parameters on the probability of leaving unemployment.
Section III presents our comparison of the unemployment spella of UI
recipients and nonrecipients.

Section IV applies econometric

duration models to administrative data on the spells of UI
recipients, and section V presents simulations using these estimates.
Section VI provides some concluding remarks.

II. Theoretical

Background

In this section, we analyze the likely impacts of the level and
potential duration of unemployment benefits on duration of
unemployment and the time pattern of the escape rate from
unemployment.

We discuss the predictions of three types of models

(1) a standard job search model;

(2) job search models that

incorporate the layoff-rehire process; and (3) a static labor-leisure
choice model.

Standard Job Search Model with no Recalls
Mortensen (1977) utilizes a dynamic search model with no recall

offer
possibility, variable search intensity, a stationary known wage
distribution, and a constant arrival rate of job offers (for a given
search intensity) to analyze the effects of UT on the escape rate
from unemployment.

Mortensen incorporares two key features of the UI

system in the United States into the model: benefits are assursed to
be paid only for a specified duration rather than in every period of
an unemployment spell, and new entrants or workers who quit joba are
not qualified for benefits.5
As the remaining number of weeks of benefits available to a
qualified unemployed worker decreases, the value of remaining
unemployed also decreases.

This drop causes the reservation wage to

fall and search intensity to increase as an individual geta closer to
when benefits lapse.

These changes in behavior imply that the escape

rate from unemployment rises until the date of benefit exhaustion.
After exhaustion, the hazard rate is constant given the assumption
that the environment is stationary.

The time pattern of the hazard

rate for an unemployed worker initially qualified for UI benefits
with potential duration of P0 periods is illustrated by the solid
line in Figure lA.6 If individuals can locate jobs and arrange not
to begin work until their benefits run out, one might observe a
discrete increase in the escape tate near the point of benefits
exhaustion followed by a discrete drop after exhaustion.
Mortensen's model suggests that changes in the level and length

raises the escape rate from unemployment for workers who currently do

The effect of an increase in the potential duration of benefits

Higher benefits reduce the escape

Since the entitlement effect is likely to he

small relative to the standard search subsidy effect, the average
duration unemployment is likely to rise with increases in both the
level and potential duration of benefits.

Recall Prosoects, UI Benefits, and Unemoloyment Soell Duration
The standard job search model is not entirely appropriate for
analyzing the unemployment durations of workers on layoff with some
possibility of recall.

Ihe interpretation of empirical evidence on

the duration of insured unemployment spells in the U.S.8 requires a
consideration of the role played by recalls since the majority of
insured unemployment spells appear to end in recall (Katz, 1986a;
Katz and Meyer, 1988). The prospect of recall affects the
probability of leaving unemployment directly through the rate of
actusl recalls and indirectly by affecting worker search behavior.
Katz (1986a) extends a standard model of jab search to include an
exogenous probability of recall.9

He shows that under reasonable

majority of insured unemployment spells in Canada also end in
recall by the previous employer. See-Robertson (1988).
9Burdett and Mortensen (1978) and Pissarides (1982) also analyze
job search models that incorporate the possibility of recalls.

conditions better recall prospects reduce the new job finding rate by
raiaing the reservation wage and reducing the likelihood of search.
The statistical model of unemployment spell durations generated
by the job search models extended to allow for recalls is a competing
risks model in which unemployment spells can end either through
recall or the finding of an acceptable new job.

The predictions of

standard job search models for how variables affect the escape rate
from unemployment really refer to the new job finding rate and these
predictions need not hold for the overall escape rate from
unemployment

(the sum of the recall and new job finding races).

Tnformation on whether spells end through recall or the finding of a
new job allows an econometrician to estimate a competing risks aodel.
Katz and Meyer (1988) have analyzed the unemployment spell durations
of a sample of UI recipients in Missouri using a competing risks
approach.

They find that UT recipients who expect to be recalled

have much lower new job finding rates than those who do not expect to
be recalled, and that the new job and recall races have quite
different time patterns and are often correlated in opposice
directions with characteristics of individuals.
Mortensen (1987) analyzes the effects of limited duration UT
benefits in a joint wealth maximizing model of job separations that
incorporates the possibility of temporary layoffs.

Layoffs occur in

response to reductions in match-specific productivity.

The

reservation wage decreases over the course of an unemployment
as a worker approaches benefit exhaustion.

This induces an

increasing new job finding rate as in Mortenaen (1977) and an

spell

10

increasing recall rate as well.

Mortenaen shows that for realistic

parameter values most of the decline in rhe reservation wage should
occur in the last week or two before exhaustion.

The discrete change

in the flow value of being unemployed when benefits are exhausted
yields the prediction rhat many firms may recall laid-off workers
around the benefir exhaustion point and that the new job finding rate
should increase around exhaustion.

The duration and incidence of

unemployment spells are shown to rise with increases in the level and
length of benefits.

Unemoloymenr Soell Duration in a Sraric Labor-Leisure Choice Model

who use a aratic model where unemployed workers have preferences over

This kink combined with a

continuous distribution of tastes implies that many people will
maximize their utility by rerurning to work the week benefits lapse.

patn.r..

Moffitt and Nicholson show that increases in rhe level and length
of benefits generate income and subsritution effects which serve to
increase the mean duration of unemployment spells.

The static nature

11

of the model makes it difficult to translate its predictions into a
hazard model framework.

The key prediction is that the escape rate

from unemployment should he relatively high near the exhaustion
point.

The impacts of increases in the level or length of benefits

on the choice of spell duration roughly translate into negative
effects on the hazard rate.

Summary
All three models considered suggest that the distribution of
unemployment spell durations should differ for UI recipients and
nonrecipients.

UI recipients should display stronger positive

duration dependence in the new job finding rate than nonrecipients at
least up through the point of exhaustion.

One may also expect to

find spikes in the escape rate (both through recalls and the finding
of new jobs) near exhaustion for UI recipients.

Increases in the

level and potential duration of benefits should increase the duration
of unemployment spells of UI recipients.

We can also determine whether UI benefits were

received during the spell, and whether completed spells ended through
recall or the taking of a new job.
The basic sample contains 1115 layoff and plant-closing
unemployment spells for household heads at least 20 and not greater
than 65 years old.12

This data set has two major advantages.

First,

lDThe questions concerning individual unemployment spells were
only asked of household heads who were labor force participants at
the time of the interview.
Individual unemployment spell infotmation
is not available for other household members.

1The P510 allows one to distinguish among job separations
arising from quits, plant closings, and other employer-initiated
separations (layoffs and firings). The P510 does not distinguish
between separations initiated through layoffs and through firings
(discharges for cause)
household head's last spell from the calendar year prior to
the interview date made it into the sample if (1) the spell ended in
recall to the pre-separation employer; (2) the spell ended in the
taking of a new job and the head was separated from his or her last
job by a plant closing, layoff, or firing; (3) the spell is censored
at the interview date and the head is categorized as on temporary
layoff; or (4) the spell is censored at the interview date and the
head is categorized as unemployed having been separated from last job
by plant closing, layoff or firing. Observations satisfying the
above criteria were deleted from the sample if they had missing
information on pre-separation industry, occupation, spell duration,
spell start date, or UI receipt. An observation was also deleted if
the head at the time of the interview was not the head in the
previous year.

recipients and only information on weeks of compensated

unemploymentJ3

Second, our data set allows us to separate the

escape rate from unemployment into its component parts: the new job
finding rste and the recall rate.

The ability to separate new job

acceptances from recalls is important since the impacts of UI on job
search behsvior predicted by standard search models refet to the new
job finding rste and do not necessarily translate into predictions
for the total escape rate in samples where recalls are important.
The PSID data set also has several disadvantages.

First,

information is only available on whether UI is received at sometime
during a spell.

One cannot identify the level or potential duration

of the benefits available.

Second, response biases for retrospective

information on individual unemployment spells can be severe.
Mathiowetz and Duncan (1968) find in a study of response bias in
retrospective answers to unemployment questions similar to those
found in the PSID that short spells tend to be underreported and that
the reported start and end dates of spells are often quite
inaccurate.

It is unclear whether this type of response bias

Samole Hazard Functions for UI Recioients and hionrecipients
The

pattern of unemployment spell durations for UI recipients and

28.

The figures plot the Kaplan-Meier empirical hazards for the two

samples with the weekly duration data grouped into two week intervals
for ease of presentation.

The overall empirical hazard for a given

two week period is the fraction of spells ongoing at the start oi the
period which end during the two week interval.

17Formal duration model estimates reported in Katz (l965) that
include demographic variables, industry, occupation, the county
unemployment rate, and a plant closing dummy indicate that the
differences in the spell durations for the two groups are largely
explained by differences in these observed variables.

The figures reveal substantial differences in the pattern of the
escape rate froa unemployment for UI recipients and nonrecipients.
The total hszard rates are initially downward sloping for both
groups.

The total hazard increases substantially in the 25 to 40

week interval for UI recipients.

There are large spikes in the

escape rate from unemployment at 26 weeks and at 39 weeks for UI
recipients.

Spikes of similar magnitude at 26 and 39 weeks ste not

apparent for UI nonrecipients.

While the exact placing of the spikes

may be an artifact of the tendency for individuals to report long
unemployment rates as lasting exactly half a year, three quartets, or
one year (Sider, 1985), the much greater importance of these spikes
for UI recipients strongly suggests that they may be related to the
limited duration of UI benefits. Most UI recipients during this
period were eligible for either 26 or 39 weeks of benefits in a

and is much more upward sloping for UI recipients.

The lower initial

new job finding rate for UI recipients may be an artifact of the one
week waiting period before UI eligibility in most states.
Individuals expecting quite short spells may also not bother to apply
for benefits.

On the other hand, these factors could not plausibly

account for the differences in the new job finding rate patterns for
UI recipients and nonrecipients

after the first few weeks.

The low

initial new job finding rate and apparent positive duration
dependence in the new job finding rate for UI recipients provides
support for the prediction that UI depresses new job finding when
time until exhaustion is large and that the escape rate rises with
time until exhaustion.

The jumps in the recall and new job finding

rates for UI recipients at likely exhaustion points (26 and 39 weeks)
are strong evidence for the prediction that firms teke into account
the duration of UI benefits in designing recall policies (as
suggested by the Mortensen'a

(1987) modeI of the impact of limited

duration UI on recall policies) and that workers become much more
likely to take new jobs as their benefits run out.

The absence of

such patterns for nonrecipients in the PSID sample strongly suggests
that these patterns represent behavioral responses by firms and
workers to the incentives created by a UI system with limited benefit
duration.
The sample hazard functions plotted in the figures do nor take
into account heterogeneity among individuals in the sample.

Although

18

uncontrolled heterogeneity biases estimates of duration dependence in
the total hazard towards spurious findings of negative

duration

dependence, a bias in the opposite direction is possible for an
individual escape route hazard in a competing risks model.

If

uncontrolled factors that raise the recall rate also reduce the new
job finding rate, then one can (at least in theory) generate spurious
positive duration dependence in the new job hazard.19

In fact,

Katz

(1986a) finds that positive duration dependence in the new job
finding rare for UI recipients is more prevalent when controls for
observables are included in formal duration model estiaaces using
this PSID data set.

The differences between the escape rates for UI

recipients and nonrecipients and the spikes near exhaustion points
for UI recipients also remain when we estimate competing risks models

with nonparametric baseline hazards and controls for observables are
estimated,29

Furthermore, Katz and Meyer (1988) find substantial

increases in both the recall and the new job finding rates near the
week of benefits exhaustion and find strong positive duration
dependence in the new job finding rate for a sample of UI recipients

19Katz (l986b) shows that the cooditions required for unobserved
heterogeneity to lead to a bias in the direction of positive duration
dependence in the new job hazard are quite extreme.
20Man and Hausman (1986) have developed an estimator to handle
unobserved heterogeneity that is correlated among the risks in a
competing risks model. They have implemented their estimator on a
sub-sample of our PSID data set that excludes spells initiated by
plant closings. Their results indicate that there is essentially
zero correlation among the unobservables in the new job and recall
hazards and that allowing for correlated, unobserved heterogeneity
does not qualitatively affect one's inferences for this data set.

IV. Hazsrd Model Estimates using the Moffitt Data Set

This section reports hazard model estimates of the effect of the
level and length of UI benefits on unemployment durations.

We use

22The original Moffitt (1985a) data set contains 4&28
observations. 1,227 observations are excluded because of missing
data on age, schooling, dependents or marital status. 36
observations are excluded because the recorded spell is longer than
the reported potential duration of benefits.
23The spells in the Moffitt data are periods of benefit receipt.
Spells that are interrupted by short periods when benefits are not
received are concatenated. This modified spell of benefit receipt
may do a better job of grouping together periods of similar behavior.

benefit exhaustion.

On the other hand, the data set only covers

compensated unemployment so that one cannot use it to make inferences
about what happens to individuals after benefits are exhausted.

The

data set also does not permit one to identify whether spells end
through recall or the finding of a new job.

Thus one can only

analyze the overall unemployment escape rate.
The duration of unemployment spells is analyzed using formal
hazard model techniques.

We use a proportional hazards model

estimator that allows for time-varying explanatory variables and
which nonparametrically

estimates the change in the hazard over time.

This semiparametric approach is analyzed in detail in Meyer

(1986).

The estimates are the parameters of a continuous time hazard model

Discussion of the Estimates
The coefficient estimates from the specifications are reported
in Table 2.

Meyer (1988) provides a detailed discussion of the

estimates from similar specifications using this data set.

A

discussion of the non-UI variable coefficients can also be found
there.

In all of the specifications tried the UI benefit level has a

large negative effect on the hazard rate.

week before exhaustion.

Since the data set we utilize contains information on sleeks of
benefit receipt rather than on actual weeks of unemployment,

an

institutional feature of state UI systems could be responsible for
some of the rise in the hazard found in the last week before benefits
lapse.

In most states there is a cap on the total dollar amount of

benefits paid to an individual during a benefit year.

The cap

typically depends on an individual's base period earnings.

If this

cap on total benefit payments is binding, an individual may receive
smaller benefit payment in his or her last week of eligibility.

individuals may not bother to pick up this smaller final check.
Individuals who remained unemployed but did not collect their final
UI benefit would be treated in our hazard model estimates as escaping
from unemployment in the week before benefits are exhausted.
The possibility that these smaller final payments could
spuriously generate the rise in the hazard just before exhaustion was
examined using an additional dats set.

The data set contains CWBH

informstion on 38,472 unemployment spells from 8 states during 19791984.

The eight states include seven of the twelve in our subset of

the CWBH data set previously snalyzed by Moffitt.

We compared the

hazard rate of exit from compensated unerployment in the week before
regular benefits lapse when the benefit payment was its full amount
and when it was reduced because of the cap on total dollar benefits.
Those who received Extended Benefits or Federal Supplemental
Compensation benefits were excluded.

For the eight states the hazard

wss 21 percent higher (25.7 percent as compared to 21.2 percent) when
the last payment was less than the full weekly amount.

While these

comparisons are somewhat crude since we did not control for other
individual attributes, they support the hypothesis that a lower
benefit amount may cause people not to claim their last week of
benefits.

However, because only s slim majority of the final

payments are less than the full amount, this effect could only cause
s 12 percent

lapse.

increase in the overall hazard the week before benefits

Thus, only a small part of the rise in the hazard just before

exhaustion could be explained by this phenomenon.
The estimates reported in Table 2 also indicate that the

25

probability of a spell ending is very high in a week in which
benefits were scheduled to lapse at soae point earlier in a spell.
One interpretation of this result is that some firas' plan the tiaing
of recalls and some workers' arrange the starting of a new job to
coincide with the end of eligibility for benefits, but do not alter
these plans in the face of an extension of benefits.

Alternatively,

this result could reflect that some people eligible for extended
benefits do not claim them.
The estimated effect of the benefit level on the length oi
unemployment spells is at the high end of the distribution of recent
estimates.

A consensus of the previous estimates of the effect of a

ten percentage point increase in the replacement ratio might be a
one-half to one week increase in the length of spells.25
estimate is around one and one-half weeks.

Here the

Larger estimated effects

are a plausible result of better data on spell length and the level
and length of benefits.

Many other studies have hsd to impute the

level of benefits for individuals and often it is not known who is
even eligible for benefits.
The sources of variation in benefit levels in our data are
nonlinesrities in the benefit schedules (different minima and maxima
across states), legislative changes during the sample period, and the
erosion of real benefit levels due to inflation between legislative
changes.

Benefit maxims differ substantially across states.

For

example, the maximum benefit in Missouri is below the mean benefit in

An interaction between the level of benefits and time until

exhaustion (and may
higher benefits will have less of an effect near

significant.
Several other specifications were tried, but are not reported.
If Specification

(2) is estimated without atate fixed effects,

the

benefit level coefficient almost doubles in absolute value to .0073
(standard error .0011), while the estimated time until exhaustion and
potential benefit duration effects are not greatly altered. The
exclusion of fixed effects also causes the state unemployment rate to
change sign while retaining statistical significance.

It appears

that higher unemployment states also tend to have longer spells, but
when the unemployment rate rises within a given state the mean speli
length drops.

This finding may be the result of a composition effect

in
arising from the greater frequency of short temporary layoffs
downturns. Other interactions between the benefit level and tiae
until exhaustion were tried, but they were small and inaignificant.
Further apecificationa were estimated which explicitly accounted
for the potential impact of omitted variables on the hazard model
estimates.

These left out variables are typically called unobserved

heterogeneity.

Specifications which allowed unobserved heterogeneity

The signs and statistical

significance of the main coefficients did not change appreciably, but
the benefit coefficients

(benefit level, benefit and age interaction,

V. Simulating

the Impact of Changes in the Length and Level of UI

Sene fits

In this section, we simulate the effect of changes in the level
and length of UI benefits on the duration of unemployment spells, the
exhaustion rate, and the amount of benefits paid.

Simulations are

useful to better describe the effects of changes in covariates
because the transformation from a change in the hazard to changes in
spell length is complex.

The complexity arises from the nonlinearity

of the model and the estimation of a separate baseline hazard
parameter for each spell length interval.

Simulations also provide

degree of robustness to unobserved heterogeneity.

One interpretation

of results presented in Lancaster (1985) is that unobserved
heterogeneity biases coefficient estimates toward zero but will have
little effect on elasticities of mean duration with respect to
covariates.26

Our simulations essentially calculate these mean

duration elasticities.

The simulations also allow one to use the

entire distribution of explanatory variables rather than evaluating
the model at the mean of the covariates.

The

base case difference occurs because the simulations assuae that
potential duration does not change during the unemployment spells,
while in the actual Moffitt data the potential duration benefits
rises in the course of many spells as benefits are extended.

This

effect is captured through the baseline hazard estimates in
Specification I rather than directly in the potential duration of

Tn both sets of

simulations the potential duration of benefits is assuaed to be
constant over time, but in Specification 1 the baseline hazard
estimates implicitly incorpotate increases in the potential duration

Thus the simulations from Specification

the scenarios.
We simulated the impact of changes in UI parameters on the

that occurs when extended benefits are triggered in the United

length of benefits have substantial effects on the aean duration of
unemployment of UI recipients.

The two sets of simulations provide

quite similar estimates of the impact of policy changea.

An incteaae

in the potential duration of benefits from 26 to 39 weeks is
predicted to raise the mean unemployment spell duration by 2.1 weeks
in both simulations.

This is a surprisingly large effect given that

mechanically increase the mean compensated spell duration even if
benefits have no incentive effect since previously uncompensated
unemployment will be classified as compensated unemployment.

The

predicted effect of an extension of benefits from 26 weeks to 39
weeks if there are no incentive effects from extending benefits
(using Specification 2) is a 0.9 week increase in mean compenaated
spell duration.

Thus most of the impact of extended benefits on

compensated unemployment arises through the negative effects of UI on
the escape rate from unemployment.
We conclude from an examination of a variety of simulated changea
in potential benefit durations that a one week extension of banefira
increases the mesn duration of an unemployment spell by approximately
0.16 to 0.20 weeks.

One caveat in interpreting these estimates is

thst much of the variation in the potential length of benefits atiaes
from the extension of benefits in times
conditions.

of poot macroeconomic

Tf the time-varying state unemployment tate variable

included in our specifications does not fully capture labor market
conditions, then part of the our estimate of the increase in the

34
duration of unemployment from an increase in potential benefit
duration may aimply reflect that potential benefit duration is high
when job availability is low.

However, the estimated effects of UI

are corroborated by Specification 1 which does not use this source of
variation in the UI parameters and still gives similar results.
Our estimates of the impact of potential benefit duration on the
average unemployment

spell duration of UI recipients are s bit larger

than most of those in the literature.

Our estimates are slightly

larger than Moffitt's (1985a) estimate of 0.15 weeks from a model
that does not include state dummy variables.

Hoffitt and Nicholson

(1982) find using a static labor supply estimation framework that s
one week extension raises the average unemployment duration by 0.10
week.

Noffitt and Nicholson's sample includes only UI recipients who

had exhausted their regular benefits, and their measure of
unemployment includes both compensated and uncompensared
unemployment.

It seems plausible that a group of largely

"long-

term" unemployed workers, such as the sample analyzed by Hoffitt and
Nicholson, may be less sensitive to benefits than a more
representative group of UI recipients such as in the data set we
examine.

In a study of Canadian UI recipients, Ham and Res (1987)

find that s one week increase in the duration of benefits increases
the mean duration to the start of a new job by 0.26-0.33 weeks in a

competing risks framework.28
The hypothetical UI parameter changes examined in the simulations

difficult to translate this finding into an estimate of the effect on
the mean duration of unemployment.

A

reduction in the level of benefits by 10 percent has an impact on the
UI budget similar to a reduction in the potential duration of
benefits from 39 to 26 weeks.

The simulations indicate that

increases in potential benefit duration have much larger adverse
incentive effects on unemployment than do chmnges in the level of
benefits that have the same effect on the UI budget.

The simulations

in Table 4 show that the budget cut from the base case accomplished
through s 10 percent reduction in benefits reduces mean unemployment
by 1.2 weeks, while a similar budget cut done through eliminating
extended benefirs generstes almost twice as large a reduction in
unemployment.
These findings suggest that a government with a fixed UI budget
faces s sharp trade-off between incentives and insurance in the
design of the level and time sequence of UI payments.

A balanced

budget reduction in the level and increase in the maximum duration of
benefits has strong adverse incentive effecra although it does
provide grester protection for those who are unlucky in their
attempts to gain reemployment.

The theoretical results of Shavell

and Weiss (1979) concerning the optimal design of a UI system subject
to e fixed UI budget combined with our findings of strong behavioral
effects of UI on the rate of reemployment suggest that a system of
high benefits with limited duration may be preferable to one with
lower benefits of longer duration.

The Impacts of Extended Benefits on the Income of the Unemployed

On the other hand, if a higher

duration of benefits increases unemployment duration and does nor
affect reemployment wages, the extension of benefits may reduce the
income (although probably not the welfare) of UI recipients if
reemployment wages are higher than UI benefits.
The following simple calculations are instructive concerning the
incentive effects of increases in benefit duration.

The simulations

presented in Table 4 imply that an increase in benefit duration from
26 to 39 weeks

raises the unemployment income of typical UI

recipients by $223 (from $1222 to $1455

in 1977 dollars).

unaffected by the availability of extended benefits.

Under this

assumption, the change in a UI recipient's money income arising from
the extension of benefits is given by the formula:

A Income =

A(Weeks of compensated unemployment) * (WeeklyUI benefit)

C

-

C

A(Total Weeks of unemployment) * (Reemployment weekly wage))

In Table 5, we present the predicted impact on the income of a UI
recipient (with pre-Ul weekly earnings equal to our sample average of
$170) of an increase in potential benefit duration from 26 to 39
weeks.

We use the simulations discussed above based on

specifications (1) and (2) from Table
each specification.

2.

We consider three oases for

The first case assumes there are no behavioral

effects of extended benefits.

The second case assumes that extended

benefits increase unemployment by the amounts shown in out simulation
results (in Tables 3 and 4) and that reemployment wages are 90
percent of pte-UI weekly wages.

The final case assumes these same

behavioral effects on the duration of unemployment, but assumes that
reemployment wages are only 60 percent of pre-Ul weekly wages.

Katz

and Meyer (1988) find that the typical UI recipient who gains
teemployment within a year of layoff has (initial) reemployment
weekly earnings that ste approximately 10 percent less than pta-UI
weekly earnings.

On the other hand,

those who were not recalled and

exhausted benefits averaged 50 percent losses in weekly earnings.
The calculations presented in Table 5 suggest that extending
benefits may reduce the total money income of UI recipients.

assumes that reemployment earnings ste 90 percent of ptevious

that the

income of the typical UI recipient actually falls in response to an
increase in potential benefit duration from 26 to 39 weeka.

If

workers whose behavior is most strongly affected by extended henefita
have low reemployment wages, then it is likely that extended benefits
raise the money income of UI recipients.

Of course, these

calculations ignore the increases in leisure accruing ro Ut
recipients from greater unemployment and do not take into account the
possibility that extended benefits may allow workers to make better
job matches raising future earnings from employment.

If a longer

durstion of benefits allows workers to find higher paying jobs and
these jobs last for even several months, then extended benefits are
likely to raise the income of the unemployed.

VI.

Conclusions
The evidence presented in this paper indicates that the potential

duration of UI benefits has a strong impact on the duration of the
unemployment spells of UI recipients in the United States.

Our

examination of data from the PSID indicates that the distributions of
unemployment spell durstions of UI recipients and nonrecipients are
quite different.

Substantial increases in both the recall rare and

new job finding rate are apparent for UI recipients around the time
when benefits are likely to lapse.

Large increases in the eacape

rate from unemployment in the several weeks before exhaustion are

39

also apparent for a large sample of UI tecipients for which
administrative data allows us to accurately date the end of the spell
and the point at which benefits are exhausted.

Katz and Meyer (1988)

report similar increases in the hazard rate near exhaustion for
another sample of UI recipients.

It seems safe to conclude that

potential benefit duration has significant behavioral effects on firm
recall policies and worker new job finding strategies.

Furthermore,

our estimates indicate that policies that extend benefits have much
greater adverse incentive effects on the duration of unemployment
than policies with the same predicted impact on the government budget
which raise the level of benefits.
Our results indicate that a one week increase in potential
benefit duration increases the average duration of the unerployment
spells of UI recipients by about 0.16 to 0.20 weeks.

These estimates

can be used guardedly to make a rough guess as to what the impact of
longer potential benefit durations in Europe than in the United
An increase in

States is on the mean duration of unemployment.

potential benefit duration from six months to one year is predicted
to increase mean duration of unemployment by 4 to

5

weeks, and an

increase from six months to two years is predicted to generate a 13
to 16 week increase in unemployment duration,

The average

uncompleted duration of ongoing spells was 68.2 weeks in the United
Kingdom in 1984 versus 18 weeks in the United States (Lsyard and
Mickell, 1986).

The fraction of the unemployed covered by benefits

40
is also much lower in the United States than in the United Kingdom.30
Thus, longer duration of benefits may be able to explain about 10 to
30 percent of the difference in mean unemployment

spell durations

between the United States and the United Kingdom.
Two caveats about our results should be kept in mind.

First,

while lower unemployment benefits might decrease the length of UI
recipients' spells, the spells of non-UI recipients might rise due to
congestion/displacement

effects.

If aggregate employment is

determined by the level of demand, and the marching of particular
workers to jobs is not important, shorter unemployment spells for ono
group would imply longer spells on average for others.

This effect

would imply that our estimates of the microeconomic effects of UI on
unemployment are sn overestimate of the macroeconomic effects.
Second, we have concentrated on transitions in one direction between
only Iwo of the possible labor market states.
(1982)

Clark and Summers

and Topel (1985) have emphasized the effects of UI on other

transitions.

A more encompassing analysis of the effects of UI on

the labor market might yield different conclusions about the
aggregste effects of changes in the level and length of UI benefits.

30Blank and Card (1988) and Kane (1988) document the recent
decline in the fraction of the unemployed receiving UI in rho U.S.
and examine alternative explanations for this phenomenon.
