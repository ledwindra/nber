JEL No. J16,O15
ABSTRACT
That unmarried individuals die at a faster rate than married individuals at all ages is well
documented. Unmarried women in developing countries face particularly severe vulnerabilities,
so that excess mortality faced by the unmarried is more extreme for women in these regions
compared to developed countries. We provide systematic estimates of the excess female mortality
faced by older unmarried women in developing regions. We place these estimates in the context
of the missing women phenomenon. There are approximately 1.5 million missing women
between the ages of 30 and 60 years old each year. We find that 35% of these missing women of
adult age can be attributed to not being married. These estimates vary by region. India has the
largest proportion of missing adult women who are without a husband, followed by the countries
in East Africa. By contrast, China has almost no missing unmarried women. We show that 70%
of missing unmarried women are of reproductive age and that it is the relatively high mortality
rates of these young unmarried women (compared to their married counterparts) that drive this
phenomenon.

SIWAN ANDERSON AND DEBRAJ RAY

A BSTRACT. That unmarried individuals die at a faster rate than married individuals at all ages is well documented. Unmarried women in developing countries face particularly severe vulnerabilities, so that excess
mortality faced by the unmarried is more extreme for women in these regions compared to developed countries.
We provide systematic estimates of the excess female mortality faced by older unmarried women in developing
regions. We place these estimates in the context of the missing women phenomenon. There are approximately
1.5 million missing women between the ages of 30 and 60 years old each year. We find that 35% of these
missing women of adult age can be attributed to not being married. These estimates vary by region. India has
the largest proportion of missing adult women who are without a husband, followed by the countries in East
Africa. By contrast, China has almost no missing unmarried women. We show that 70% of missing unmarried
women are of reproductive age and that it is the relatively high mortality rates of these young unmarried women
(compared to their married counterparts) that drive this phenomenon.

1. I NTRODUCTION
It is a well established fact that in developed countries, married individuals experience lower mortality rates
than their unmarried counterparts. It is a relationship that has been studied since the mid 1800s (beginning
with the work of William Farr (1858) for France). Zheng and Thomas (2013) emphatically state that “the
beneficial effect of marriage on health is one of the most established findings in medical sociology, demography, and social epidemiology.1 This relative excess mortality for the unmarried occurs at all ages, for both
sexes, and for all causes of death (Johnson et. al. 2000, Nagata et. al. 2003). This difference persists, for
both sexes, after controlling for observed socioeconomic and health related variables (Randall et. al. 2011).
The effect of death of a spouse on the mortality of the survivor — the so-called “widowhood effect” — is
well established. The increased probability of death among recently bereaved has been found in men and
women of all ages around the world (Subramanian et. al. 2008). None of this should come as a surprise:
after all, marriage provides significant economic, psychological and environmental benefits, and it involves
two partners caring for each other.
Developing countries are no exception. The data is sparser but the evidence we do have similarly indicates
relative excess mortality for the unmarried in most age groups and for both sexes.2 Arguably, most of
this stems from widow(er)hood. After all, in developing countries, marriage at young ages is essentially
universal, so that unmarried adults are typically widowed. Moreover, the price of widowhood is particularly
steep for women. In South Asia, that marginalization is well documented for both India and Bangladesh
(Chen and Dreze 1992; Jensen 2005, Rahman, Foster, and Menken 1992). Increased vulnerability is not
only a result of losing the main breadwinner of the household (the husband), but also property ownership
laws and employment norms which restrict the access of widows to economic resources.

Patrilocal norms exacerbate the situation. The economic and social support that a widow receives in her late
husband’s village is typically extremely limited. Add to these a variety of customs and beliefs: seclusion
and confinement from family and community, a permanent change of diet and dress, and discouragement of
remarriage. Widows in South Asia are considered to be bad luck and to be avoided; they are unwelcome at
social events, ceremonies and rituals. The most infamous (though least widespread) manifestation of these
social customs is sati, self-immolation on the husband’s cremation pyre.
And this is no small matter. In India, there are estimated to be more than 40 million widows, which reflects
the large husband-wife age gap (approximately 6 years) and greater remarriage incidence among widowers
compared to widows (Jensen 2005).
A similar plight can be documented for African countries (Sossou 2002, Oppong 2006). There too, rules
of inheritance and property rights restrict the access of a widow to her late husband’s resources.3 Rituals
of seclusion and general isolation of widows are a widespread practice in many parts of Africa. Widows
can be accused of witchcraft and persecuted, if suspected to have somehow caused their husbands’ death.
Witchcraft beliefs are widely held throughout Sub-Saharan Africa and elderly women are the typical targets
of witch killings (Miguel 2005). Customarily, causes for any death are sought within the prevailing social
system, and suspected witches in the family of the dead or sick are often a prime focus of blame (Oppong
2006).
Given these extreme vulnerabilities faced by widows in developing countries, we expect the excess mortality
faced by the unmarried to be relatively more extreme for women in these regions. That can lead to excess
female mortality among adult women. In this paper, we aim to provide systematic estimates of the extent of
such excess female mortality in developing regions.
Our approach and methodology allow us to place our estimates in the context of the “missing women”
phenomenon. The concept, developed by Amartya Sen (1990, 1992), is based on the observation that in parts
of the developing world, notably India and China, the overall ratio of women to men is inappropriately low.
Sen translated these skewed sex ratios into absolute numbers by calculating the number of extra women who
would have been alive in a particular country if that country had the same ratio of women to men as in areas
of the world with supposedly less gender bias in health. Our earlier work (Anderson and Ray 2010, 2012)
examined how missing women were distributed across different age groups, regions, and cause of death.
Received wisdom has it that gender bias at birth (say, via sex-selective abortions) and the mistreatment of
young girls are dominant explanations. However, while we did not dispute the existence of severe gender
bias at young ages, we found that the vast majority of missing women were of adult age.
In this paper, and following on the observations above, we focus on adult female excess mortality between
the age of 15 and 69. As already stated, this is a large fraction of overall excess mortality. Indeed, in line
with the numbers obtained in our earlier research, our estimates here suggest that there are approximately 3
million missing women of adult age each year. Our objective is to estimate the share of this excess mortality
that can be attributed to “non-marriage” alone.
We informally describe our methodology. To begin with, observe that unmarried women are relatively more
prevalent in developing countries. As one might guess, this is primarily due to higher mortality rates at every
age, so that the incidence of widowhood is significantly larger at every age group in developing (relative to
developed) countries. As already noted, unmarried women face relatively elevated mortality risk compared
to their married counterparts. To be sure, there are widowers as well as widows, and they too are subject to
elevated risks of death. Nevertheless, as long as death rates are elevated in this manner, so are the absolute
numbers of missing women — provided that the mortality rates are gender-skewed in the region to begin
with. Below, we refer to this as the marriage incidence effect.

van de Walle (2011) shows how households headed by widows in Mali have significantly lower living standards than other households in rural and urban areas.

Moreover, there are additional distortions caused by variation in the elevation factors themselves. That is,
the elevation in female mortality risk stemming from non-marriage could be relatively higher in the region
of interest. We call this the skewed elevation ratio effect. To take this into account, the entire analysis must
turn on a comparison of different ratios, and not just the elevation factors per se. We develop a methodology
to separate and understand these two components.
It turns out that more than 710,000 adult women who go missing each year can be attributed to non-marriage.
These estimates vary by region. India comprises the largest number of missing unmarried women, 230,000
each year. Followed by the countries of East Africa with 150,000. The estimates elsewhere in the world
are significantly lower. In China, for example, only 3% of the missing adult women are without a husband.
Furthermore, our estimates demonstrate that 70% of the missing unmarried women are of reproductive
age (between 15 and 49 years of age). We show that within this socially marginalized group of young
unmarried women, the skewed elevation ratio effect is primarily responsible for excess female mortaility.
The remaining 30% of the missing unmarried women are older (between 50 and 69). We find that excess
female mortality amongst this older unmarried group is due largely to the marriage incidence effect.
The above decompositions are described in detail in what follows. But it is also important to point out
what we do not do. This is not an exercise that fully identifies the causal channels that conspire to work
through marriage — or its absence — in creating excess female mortality. Rather, the exercise is dedicated
to showing that the numbers involved are large. Certainly, the vulnerabilities faced by unmarried women
in developing countries have been discussed. But a systematic quantitative assessment of the problem,
especially one that places such vulnerabilities in the larger context of excess female mortality, has not — to
our knowledge — been conducted. The contribution, then, is to place a magnitude on this problem in terms
of the extreme excess mortality risk that unmarried women appear to experience. That said, in Section 6 we
engage in a discussion of the causal impact and the possible bias created by systematic selection effects.
2. M ETHODOLOGY
We first compute the number of missing women at adult ages. We then take into account the role of marital
status to generate estimates of excess female mortality among the unmarried.
2.1. The Basics. The methodology we employ is in the spirit of the Sen contribution. Any computation of
missing women presupposes a counterfactual. For Sen this counterfactual is the set of developed countries
and we adopt the same approach here.4 For each age group we posit a “reference” death rate for females,
one that would obtain if the death rate of females in that country were to bear the same ratio to the existing
death rate of males as the corresponding ratio for developed countries. We subtract this reference rate from
the actual death rate for females, and then multiply by the population of females in that category. This is the
definition of “missing women” in the age group under consideration.
More formally, let a stand for an age group. Let dm (a) and dw (a) represent the death rates at age a, for men
and women respectively, in the region of interest (or “our region”). Use the label b for the same variables in
the benchmark or reference region.5 The reference death rate for women of age a in our region is defined
by the number that equalizes relative gender-specific death rates in the region to the corresponding ratio in
4

We discuss the appropriateness of using developed countries as the benchmark in Anderson and Ray (2010). In that paper, we
also considered Latin America and the Caribbean as an alternative benchmark, as we find far fewer missing women in that region
of the world. With this alternative benchmark the total number of missing women between the ages of 15 and 69 reduces by about
12%. The World Development Report (2012) used our methodology to compute excess female mortality around the world for every
developing country across the different age groups. Their estimates match those of Anderson and Ray (2010) very closely.
5We use the group of Developed Countries as defined by the World Bank: Europe, Canada, United States, Australia, New Zealand,
and Japan.

the reference region. That is, it is the value rw (a) that solves the condition rw (a)/dm (a) = dbw (a)/dbm (a),
or equivalently,
(1)

rw (a) =

dm (a)
.
dbm (a)/dbw (a)

This methodology turns a blind eye to the prevailing level of the death rates in our region, thereby implicitly
acknowledging that the region can be relatively poor and so prone to greater overall mortality. But it demands
that whatever that higher death rate might be, the ratio of women dying relative to men should be no different
compared to that in the reference region.6 And if we accept that, then the number of age-specific extra female
deaths, or “missing women,” in our region in a given year would be equal to the difference between the actual
and reference death rates for women, weighted by the number of women in that age group:
(2)

EFM(a) = [dw (a) − rw (a)] π w (a),

where π w (a) is the starting population of women of age a. Notice that while the reference death rate is
not affected by the average mortality rate, this estimate is: the absolute numbers of missing women would
increase with higher average mortality, ceteris paribus.
Anderson and Ray (2010) discuss the interpretation of (2) in some detail. In particular, excess female mortality might arise from a number of causes, and only some of these are explicitly interpretable as discrimination
against women, the most obvious examples being excess female mortality at the pre-natal stage, or at birth
or in infancy. Other factors, such as excess female mortality from cardiovascular disease or HIV/AIDS,
need a more nuanced interpretation. We do not revisit these issues here but refer the interested reader to our
earlier paper.
2.2. Marriage Rates and Elevation Ratios. We describe a strategy for identifying excess female deaths,
if any, due to non-marriage. This is a subtle problem. Typically, both unmarried men and women have
higher death rates, correcting for age. To the extent that creates larger numbers of deaths all around, it also
creates a larger number of excess female deaths as well. But there is a second factor at work, which is the
comparative extent by which the death rates for women are raised. To be sure, these ratios are elevated for
both our region as well as the reference region. For our purposes we will need to compare two sets of ratios.
All this will be made clearer with a bit more notation and formalism.
There is also the question of finer categories of non-marriage: widowed, divorced, or never-married. Data
limitations force us to lump these subcategories together. We postpone further discussion to Section 3.3.
Let σ m (a) and σ w (a) be the incidence of unmarried men and women respectively in age group a. For
instance, if σ m (a) = 0.1, then 10% of all men in age group a are unmarried; and 90% are married. Denote
by em (a) and ew (a) the elevation factors for males and females respectively; that is, the relative rise in the
death rates conditional on lack of marriage. For instance, if ew (a) = 1.1, then unmarried women in age
group a are 10% more likely to die, compared to married women in that age group.
2.3. Excess Female Mortality by Marital Category. Our focus is on marriage — or the lack thereof —
and to get at this it will be useful to proceed in a couple of steps. Begin by carrying out the same exercise
leading up to (1), but starting with married individuals. That is, let δ w (a) and δ m (a) be the death rates for
married females and males, respectively. Use the label bto denote these same variables for the benchmark
or reference region. We can now generate a “reference” death rate for married women of age a in our region
6We are, of course, aware that any such “adjustment method” can be criticized; see Anderson and Ray (2010) for a discussion of

this point. But keeping the ratio constant has a strong intuitive appeal. Besides, this is the approach predominantly taken in the
literature since the work of Sen.

ρw (a) =

δ m (a)
,
δbm (a)/δbw (a)

and we are then in a position to define excess female mortality with marriage benchmarks (EFM0 ) at age a
by
(4)

EFM0 (a) = [δ w (a) − ρw (a)] π w (a),

where π w (a) is, as before, the entire population of females of age a. Note that we are multiplying by the full
female population, so this is not an estimate of how many women are missing among the married. It is an
estimate of missing women in the entire population under the presumption that the death rates for married
individuals apply to everyone. So, for instance, if the married and unmarried death rates were all the same
for women and men, then EFM(a) = EFM0 (a). But if there is elevation, then EFM(a) > EFM0 (a). We
are interested in the empirical magnitude of this difference.
Let us make the connection clearer by converting the values on the right-hand side of (4) into the aggregated
rates that we have in (2). Recalling the elevation factors and marriage incidence rates already defined, we
see that


(5)
di (a) = σ i (a)ei (a) + (1 − σ i (a)) δ i (a) ≡ ci (a)δ i (a),
for i = m, w, where cm (a) and cw (a) can be viewed as “correction factors” that are generated by the
elevation factors, and by the proportions of married males and females.
An increase in the elevation factor ei (a) raises ci (a). Moreover, given some ei (a) > 1, a greater incidence
of non-marriage will also increase ci (a), as there is a shift away from the lower death rate category. In short,
larger values of ci (a) point to higher death rates in the unmarried category, and given that, is correlated with
a lower incidence of marriage.
Use the label b to denote these same variables for the benchmark or reference region. Invoking (5) for both
regions and both genders, we have
ρw (a) =

can be viewed as the relative elevation at age a in the region, compared to the reference region. Recall that
ci (a) is larger the greater the elevation factors and the smaller the incidence of marriage. Moreover, the
larger these differences in our region, compared to the reference region, the larger is the value of θ(a).
The gap between EFM and EFM0 can be viewed as the additional number of missing women due to nonmarriage (and the consequently higher death rates). Call this gap EFM1 , then
EFM1 (a) ≡ EFM(a) − EFM0 (a)

There are two components in this equation. The first is what one might call the marriage incidence effect,
and is given by the term [1 − (1/cw (a))]EFM(a). Lower marriage — typically because of widow(er)hood
— increases death rates for both men and women, and makes cw (a) larger than 1. This elevation is more
accentuated the higher the rate of non-marriage. Even if the relative death rates for women change exactly
the same way for both the reference region and the region of interest (so that θ(a) = 1), this will still
increase the total number of missing women relative to the marriage benchmark. After all, the absolute gap
between the death rate and its reference counterpart will have widened.
The second component is what might be termed the skewed elevation ratio effect, and is given by the term
[θ(a) − 1]rw (a)(π w (a)/cw (a)) in (8). If female death rates in our region climb with lack of marriage at
a rate that exceeds the benchmark rate of the reference region, then this increases the value of θ(a) and
contributes to missing women. (Even though it might increase the denominator cw (a) as well, the net effect
is positive.7) We will need to be guided by the data on this matter, but there are reasons to believe that
the female correction factor does indeed bear a higher ratio to its male counterpart in the region of interest,
relative to the reference region. First, if there is a large gap between male and female age at marriage in the
region of interest, adult women will tend to be widowed more often, so that the rate of non-marriage will
be higher, especially in the middle-age category. Second, if the traditional discrimination against women
is reflected to a proportional degree in widowhood, the relative elevation ratio ew (a)/em (a) will tend to be
higher in the region of interest. Both factors work in the same direction: they raise the female correction
factor relative to the male factor in the region of interest.
It is also worth reiterating that the correction term c is generated from two sources: one is the ratio of
elevation factors, and the other is the incidence of non-marriage. Of course, the latter has no meaning in
the absence of the former: if e were 1, then the incidence of non-marriage would be irrelevant. On the
other hand, if e > 1 (and we shall see that this is indeed the case), then a lower marriage rate raises the
correction term. In an effort to disentangle the “pure” effect of the elevation ratio from the additional impact
of marriage incidence, we can decompose each component of (8) into two parts. We can do so by first
shutting down the differential incidence of marriage altogether, by simply using the rates of marriage that
prevail in the reference region. That is, we can define pseudo-correction factors for the region of interest by
bi (a)ei (a) + (1 − σ
bi (a))
cie (a) ≡ σ
for i = m, w, and a pseudo relative elevation, given by
θe (a) ≡

m
cw
e (a)/ce (a)
.
b
cw (a)/b
cm (a)

With these in hand, we can define a new measure of missing women from non-marriage, call it EFM1e ,
which allows for the elevation but not the different rates of marriage across the two regions. It is given by

It also has two components, of course, just as EFM1e did. The remaining term is
EFM1 (a) − EFM1e (a)
as a matter of accounting, and can be tentatively interpreted as the additional number of missing women due
to changes in marriage incidence alone. This term may be positive or negative. If non-marriage rates are
high in the region of interest, say due to widowhood, this term will also make a positive contribution.
Just how large EFM1 (a) and EFM1e (a) are is in practice an empirical question, and the goal of this paper is
to provide both estimates.
3. DATA
In our computations of EFM1 (a) and EFM1e (a), we focus on the ages 15 to 69. Our regions of interest are
India, China, South Asia (excluding India), Southeast Asia, West Asia, East Africa, West Africa, Middle
Africa, South Africa, and North Africa. That is, we focus on regions where there is excess female mortality
to begin with: in other parts of the developing world, such as East Asia (excluding China), Central Asia, and
Latin America and the Caribbean we find no excess female mortality at adult ages.
To compute EFM1 (a) and EFM1e (a), we require data to determine dw (a), dm (a), σ w (a), ew (a), σ m (a),
em (a) and π w (a) for our regions of interest and for our reference region. Estimates of marital status by age
group (σ w (a) and σ m (a)) are available for all countries from the U.N. World Marriage Data (2012).8. The
major sources of data on marital status used for these estimates are censuses, sample surveys and national
estimates based on population register data or estimation methods using census data.
For estimates on population and mortality rates by age and gender (dw (a) and dm (a)) we rely on the latest
global, regional and country-level mortality rates by age and sex, released by the World Health Organization
in 2016.9 These estimates come from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD), which is the most comprehensive worldwide observational epidemiological study to date.10 The GBD data is collected and analysed
by a consortium of more than 2300 researchers in more than 130 countries. The data capture mortality
rates in 195 countries by age and sex from 1990 to the present. The GBD engages a network of individual
collaborators with expertise on allcause mortality; specific diseases, injuries, risk factors, and impairments;
and countryspecific epidemiology. New data and methodological innovation lead to regular revisions of the
estimates. The Core Analytic Team of the GBD is responsible for systematically collating and cataloguing
data from sources such as vital registration, hospital data, disease registry data, surveillance systems, censuses, and large-scale household surveys. All available relevant sources of data for a given disease, injury,
and risk factor and for allcause mortality are employed. For a country like India, there are a total of 1598 different sources used to generate the mortality estimates, whereas for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, there
are fewer sources, mainly due to less reliable vital statistic information, but still a very extensive number
of sources are used. For example, the Burkina Faso estimates use 258 different sources. These include
micro-level surveys conducted at the national level such as the: Demographic Health Survey; Continuous
Multisectoral Survey; Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire Survey; Demographic Survey; General Population Census; Health Statistical Yearbook; Household Health Coverage Survey; Malaria Indicator Survey;
Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey; National Nutrition Survey; Performance, Monitoring, and Accountability
Survey; Population and Housing Survey; Priority Survey; School Health Survey. Like India, the estimates

also rely on information from a number of Health and Demographic Surveillance sites (HDSSs) as well as
from more than 200 medical publications, which use first-hand data from locations in Burkina Faso. For
Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, the GBD estimates rely on information from 4889 different sources. 11 For
all data sources identified, the sampling method, case definitions, and potential for bias are assessed. The
GBD includes a Scientific Council, a Management Team, a Core Analytic Team, and a robust network of
GBD Collaborators working together to produce the most accurate, uptodate, and comparable estimates of
death burden worldwide. The entire GBD Study is under the leadership of the Principal Investigator Dr.
Christopher Murray.12 It is the case that the mortality estimates put together by the expert GBD teams entail
some estimating assumptions based on certain epidemiological models. But these are country, regional, and
disease specific. It seems highly unlikely that the mortality estimate differences between men and women
that we observe in the data are universally biased, due to these modelling assumptions, so that we are systematically overestimating the extent of excess female mortality across developing countries.
Mortality rates by age, gender, and marital status (needed to compute ew (a) and em (a)) are more difficult to
obtain as this information is typically not collected in any regular way by national statistical agencies. The
U.N. Demographic Yearbook 2003 reports this information for all of these variables for several countries for
which national vital statistics information was available. That gives us enough data to compute ew (a) and
em (a) for all developed countries for the year 2003. This information, however, is far rarer for developing
countries. For our regions of interest, we have this data for four countries in Africa (Egypt, Mauritius, Reunion, and Tunisia), and nine countries in Asia (Hong Kong, Macao, Japan, Kazakhstan, Republic of Korea,
Qatar, State of Palestine, Georgia, and Azerbaijan). We use this information from the two countries in North
Africa (Egypt and Tunisia) to compute elevation ratios for the region of North Africa in 2003. We use the
three countries from East Asia (Hong Kong, Macao, and Republic of Korea) to compute elevation ratio estimates for China and Southeast Asia in 2003. Likewise, we use the four countries in West Asia (Azerbaijan,
Georgia, Palestine, and Qatar) to compute elevation ratios for that region. For our other regions of interest,
there is no national vital statistics information available for death rates by marital status, with the exception
of South Africa. The Department of Home Affairs in South Africa releases the number of registered deaths
by marital status, age, and gender each year. We use this information to compute elevation ratios for the
Southern Africa region in our analysis. For the remaining regions we turned to more micro-level studies.
The INDEPTH Network, in particular, is an umbrella organization for a number of health and demographic
surveillance sites (HDSSs) located in Africa and Asia.13 Each HDSS collects detailed mortality data on a
regular basis from specific, geographically defined, communities. This is an important source of information
for countries that do not have functional civil registration and vital statistics systems. Deaths are followed up
using verbal autopsy procedures (structured interviews with witnesses of the death, processed into cause-ofdeath information). INDEPTH has published a dataset covering over 100000 individual deaths across Africa
and Asia. Each HDSS has been collecting health information on these populations for over two decades and
information on mortality rates by marital status, age, and gender is regularly collected by all HDSSs but is
not publicly available through this network - so we contacted each of the 47 HDDSs directly. Most of them
were not willing to share this information, however, seven of them were. From this process, we are able to
compute elevation ratios for East Africa (using information from two HDSSs, one in Uganda and the other
in Malawi) and West Africa (using information from two HDSSs located in Burkina Faso and three HDSSs
located in Senegal). To compute elevation ratios for Middle Africa, we aggregate the information we have
from all of the HDSSs in both East and West Africa. None of the HDSSs located in South Asia were willing
to share the required information. To compute elevation ratios in this region, we rely on the India Human
Development Survey (collected by researchers from the University of Maryland and the National Council of
Applied Economic Research (NCAER) in New Delhi). This is a nationally representative survey of 40,000

household across India, who were first interviewed in 2004 and then again in 2011. The survey collects
information on household members who died between to the two rounds. Using this information we can
compute estimated mortality rates by age, gender, and marital status. We use these estimates to compute
elevation ratios for India and South Asia. We list all of our data sources in the Appendix.
In what follows we will compute our estimates of EFM1 (a) and EFM1e (a) for our regions of interest using
the elevation factors we compute for these regions as just described. We do not have alternative regionspecific estimates of elevation ratios at our disposal. Particularly, relying on the estimates from the HDSSs
is somewhat problematic as they come from very small samples of data located in particular communities in small regions within a country and establishing external validity beyond its defined populations is
difficult. This being said, a recent article by Byass (2016) compares the mortality estimates from the INDEPTH HDSSs and the GBD estimates and finds them to be highly congruent. Byass sates ”Although the
approaches, methods, and detailed inputs used were completely different, and independent, the high levels
of concordance observed between them lend validity to both”. INDEPTH sites are not purposefully designed to represent the countries in which they are located, and the assumption that findings from a localised
site can be compared with estimates of national situations may be unjustified. However, what Byass finds,
as might be expected, that countries with multiple sites had higher concordance correlations. In this sense
having several distributed sites goes some way towards a national sample registration system. To this end,
the fact that we have information from multiple HDSSs within specific countries in Africa (in particular
Senegal and Burkina Faso) helps the validity of our estimates. Another weakness is using estimates from
a nationally representative survey in India to capture elevation ratios in the rest of South Asia. One HDSS,
located in Bangladesh, Matlab, would not share their data with us but they have published a set of earlier
estimates of mortality rates my marital status (refer to Rahman 1993). Using these elevation ratios from
the Matlab HDSS would increase our estimates of missing unmarried women substantially. In this sense, if
anything our estimates are likely underestimates of the true number of missing unmarried women in the rest
of South Asia.
For all of our variables we chose the data from the year 2005. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD)
mortality estimates are available in five year intervals and hence this is the year that most closely matches
our available data used to compute the regional elevation ratios. Given the paucity of data, it makes little
sense to disaggregate “non-marriage” any further; on this, see Section 3.3. We focus on four different age
categories, between 15 and 69, as defined in the GBD data.
Key to the computation of EFM1 (a) is the size of θ(a), which is the female-male ratio of correction factors at
age a in our region of interest, relative to the same ratio in the reference region. The larger the female-male
correction factor in our region — influenced positively by both the elevation ratio and the overall incidence
of non-marriage — the larger is the value of θ(a). That is, recalling that a typical correction factor c(a)
(dropping superscripts) is given by σ(a)e(a) + (1 − σ(a)), it follows that θ(a) is increasing in ew (a)/em (a)
relative to the same ratio in our reference region, ebw (a)/b
em (a). It is also increasing in σ w (a)/σ m (a) relative
w
m
to its reference value σ
b (a)/b
σ (a). We now build these ratios from the data.

3.1. Marital Status by Age. We first consider σ m (a) and σ w (a), the incidence of unmarried men and
women respectively in age group a, in both our regions of interest and in our reference region. What is most
relevant for the determination of EFM1 (a) is the size of the ratio σ w (a)/σ m (a) relative to the same ratio
in our reference region, σ
bw (a)/b
σ m (a). Figure 1 plots this relative ratio for our regions of interest, and for
developed countries, our reference region. We see that the ratio σ w (a)/σ m (a) for less developed regions
is higher than for developed regions for ages older than 35. The only exception is China where this ratio is
lower than for developed countries.

Unmarried individuals could be widowed, divorced or single. The second and third subcategories are largely
symmetric across men and women, so the high values of σ w (a)/σ m (a) are primarily driven by the proportions of widows (relative to widowers) in all regions. The fact that σ w (a)/σ m (a) is lower in developed
countries relative to developing is a sign of the fact that this imbalance is heightened in developing countries, at all age groups.14 For more discussion, see Section 3.3.
3.2. Elevation. The second key component in our computation of EFM1 (a) are the elevation factors em (a)
and ew (a), which reflect the relative mortality rates of unmarried and married individuals by gender and
age.
As discussed, we construct eight main sets of elevation factors. The first is for our reference region, which is
a population-weighted average across all developed countries. We then construct average elevation factors
for North Africa (using the available data from Egypt and Tunisia); Southern Africa (using available data
from South Africa); West Africa (using information from five HDSSs); East Africa (using information from
two HDSSs); India (using information from the India Human Development Survey); East Asia (using data
from Hong Kong, Macao, and Republic of Korea); and West Asia (using data from Azerbaijan, Georgia,
Palestine, and Qatar).
What is particularly relevant for our computation of EFM1 (a) is the size of the ratio of elevation factors —
call it the elevation ratio ew (a)/em (a) — relative to the same ratio in our reference region, ebw (a)/b
em (a).
Figure 2 plots this elevation ratio for our eight different regions. We see that for all regions, in both Asia
and Africa, this ratio is higher than in developed countries at all ages below 45-50 years old (there is one
excepting for the youngest age category in West Africa). Moreover, this ratio is larger than 1 for most
developing regions (in India at all ages and in Africa before the age of at least 40), implying that relative
mortality rates for unmarried compared to married women are significantly higher than for men at these
younger ages in Africa and South Asia.
14In addition, relative to developed countries, divorce is far less common in developing countries. In India and the rest of South

Asia, the incidence of divorce is less than 1% in all age groups for men and women. In the rest of Asia it is at most 2%. In Africa,
divorce is somewhat more common at around 5%.

3.3. Subcategories of Non-Marriage. Both our methodology and computations treat the different unmarried categories (single, divorced, widowed) as one group. However, it is certainly the case that the proportions of individuals occupying each of these categories, as well as the corresponding elevation ratios across
these different categories, varies by country.
Marriage occurs earlier in developing countries. It is therefore likely the proportion of the unmarried population that is single (as opposed to widowed or divorced), especially at younger ages, will be smaller in our
regions of interest. In similar vein, because mortality rates are higher in developing countries, the proportion
of widows (as opposed to those who are single or divorced) will be correspondingly higher in the regions of
interest.
Figure 3 plots the proportion of unmarried individuals who are single or widowed in the different regions of
interest, as well as in the reference region. Panels (a) and (b) show that the proportion of singles is higher in
developed countries for all age groups, for both males and females. Panels (c) and (d) similarly show that
the proportion of the unmarried who are widowed is lower in developed countries for all ages, again for both
males and females. We see also that the proportion of widows is highest in India (for both men and women)
compared to other developing regions.
Here is the basic reason that we cannot accommodate these finer subcategories in our analysis. Figure 3
shows that widowhood, for both men and women, is very uncommon in developed countries at younger
ages. We therefore do not have reliable data on elevation ratios for this subcategory of the unmarried.
Likewise, because divorce is very rare in some parts of the developing world, we do not have reliable data on
elevation ratios for that subcategory. Furthermore, as already noted, even data on death rates conditioned on
marital status is not universally available. Therefore, all things considered, we need to group the unmarried
categories together in our analysis.
The question is whether our analysis overstates the case for unmarried missing women by lumping these
subcategories together, as we are forced to do. Specifically, the concern is that at younger ages, we are more
likely to be comparing widows in our region of interest to single (and divorced) people in our reference
region, which could bias our estimates of EFM1 (a) upwards. This would be the case if ebw (a)/b

refers to the number of missing women due to non-marriage and EFM1e refers to the number of missing women due to the
marriage incidence effect.

Using the data available, we plot ebw (a)/b
em (a) for the different unmarried categories for developed regions.
We see, from Figure 4, that for all ages, the ratio ebw (a)/b
em (a) is highest for single individuals, implying
that if anything, the estimates to follow are biased downwards.
4. U NMARRIED E XCESS F EMALE M ORTALITY
With this information in hand, we can now compute EFM1 (a) for the year 2005 in our regions of interest,
for four different age categories between 15 and 69, using the methodology outlined in Section 2.
4.1. Asia. We begin with Asia. As already noted, we concentrate on regions in which there is excess female
mortality, so we do not compute EFM1 (a) for East Asia (excluding China) and Central Asia.
The first column of Table 1 lists the numbers of missing unmarried women in each age sub-category in the
overall range 15–69, for India. In all we see that there are approximately 230,000 missing women due to
non-marriage in India in the year 2005. Most of these women are over the age of 30 (90%).
The third column of Table 1 pertains to South Asia, excluding India. In this region, we see that there are
close to 60,000 missing unmarried women each year. As a percentage of the total population of unmarried
females, this is a lower number of missing women due to non-marriage in South Asia compared to India. A
large proportion, 47%, are between the ages 30 and 49. Table 1 records 87,000 missing unmarried women
each year in Southeast Asia. This number is larger than in South Asia, but as a percentage of the total
population of unmarried females, there are fewer missing unmarried women in this region. Table 1 also
provides our estimates for China and West Asia where we find relatively fewer missing unmarried women,
compared to the other Asian regions. The few that are missing are at the younger adult ages (15 to 29).
In Section 2.3, we demonstrated how EFM1 (a) could be divided into two components, the marriage incidence effect and the skewed elevation ratio effect. In Figure 5(a), we plot the proportion of EFM1 (a)
which can be attributed to the skewed elevation ratio effect for different Asian regions, by age. We see that
EFM1 (a) is primarily composed of this factor for all ages. This demonstrates the importance of a high value
of
cw (a)/cm (a)
θ(a) = w

in determining excess female mortality from the absence of marriage in Asia in general, and India in particular. That is, the female correction factor does indeed bear a higher ratio to its male counterpart in Asia,

relative to the reference region. As the discussion to follow will show, it is not just the elevation ratios but
also the high rates of widowhood that drive the large values of θ(a).
Recall from Section 2.3 that the correction factor, which drives excess female mortality from the absence
of marriage, is generated from two sources. One is that the elevation ratios ew (a)/em (a) are larger in our
country of interest, compared to those in our reference region. The other is that the incidence of marriage is
different across the two regions. We now attempt to disentangle these two effects. For each of the estimates
in Table 1, we report corresponding estimates of EFM1e (a) for each age group. Recall from Section 2.3 that
this particular estimate of missing unmarried women allows for different elevation ratios but not different
rates of marriage across the two regions. That is, we assume the rate of non-marriage by age group is
identical across our region of interest and our reference region.
For India, we see (in the second column of Table 1) that these estimates are largest in the younger age
categories (ages 15 to 49). This implies that the excess unmarried female mortality at these younger ages,
primarily follows from the fact that the elevation ratio for India is high relative to the same ratio in our
reference region. But above the age of 50, a different phenomenon takes over. Notice that EFM1 (a)−
EFM1e (a) is a measure of missing women due to changes in marriage incidence alone. These numbers are
positive for ages above 50. So in other words, it is the large incidence of widowhood in India, at ages above
50, which is also driving the excess mortality for unmarried women at these older ages.
In South Asia, a similar pattern to India emerges. In the rest of Asia, it is also the case that the excess
unmarried female mortality in the youngest age category (15 - 29), primarily follows from the fact that
the elevation ratios are higher relative to the same ratio in our reference region. However, by comparison
to South Asia, the larger incidence of widowhood, explains a larger component of the missing unmarried
women in the rest of Asia.

HDSS (Malawi); Kaya HDSS (Burkina Faso); Mlomp HDSS (Senegal); Nanoro HDSS (Burkina Faso); Bandafassi HDSS
(Senegal), Niakhar HDSS (Senegal). EFM1 refers to the number of missing women due to non-marriage and EFM1e refers to
the number of missing women due to the marriage incidence effect.

Table 2 shows that there are approximately 300,000 missing unmarried women in Africa in the year 2005.
Roughly 51% of these are from East Africa, where as a percentage of the total population of unmarried
women the numbers are also the highest. By contrast, the countries of Middle and Lower Africa have the
lowest levels of excess female mortality from non-marriage.
In Figure 5(b), we plot the proportion of EFM1 (a) which is attributable to the skewed elevation ratio effect
for the different African regions by age. We see that, like the regions of Asia, EFM1 (a) is primarily composed of this component for all ages, except for Southern Africa. But overall, Figure 6 is in accordance with
Figure 5 in that they both demonstrate the importance of a high value of θ(a) in determining excess female
mortality from the absence of marriage in Africa as well. That is, the female correction factor does indeed
bear a higher ratio to its male counterpart in Africa, relative to the reference region.
As seen from Table 2, the majority (75%) of the missing unmarried women across Africa are between the
ages 30 and 49. From our computations of EFM1e (a) across the regions of Africa in Table 2, we see that
these are mainly due to the high elevation ratios in theses regions of Africa relative to the same ratio in our
reference region.

5. U NMARRIED E XCESS F EMALE M ORTALITY AND M ISSING W OMEN
We are now in a position to compare our estimates of unmarried excess female mortality, EFM1 (a), to
estimates of overall excess female mortality, EFM(a). In Table 3, we compute both kinds of excess mortality,
EFM(a) and EFM1 (a), across the different age groups. Comparing these totals enables us to determine how
much of the overall excess female mortality in developing regions can be attributed to not having a husband.
Across Asia and Africa, there are approximately 711,000 missing unmarried women in the year 2005. If
we break this up by age, 52% of the missing women aged 30 to 49 are due to the absence of marriage, and
34% for the older ages (50 to 69). These estimates also vary by region, with India contributing the largest
total number of missing unmarried women, followed by the countries of East Africa. China, West Asia,
West Africa, Middle Africa, and North Africa all respectively make up less than 5% of the total missing
unmarried women.
By comparing the first and second columns in each age group, we can determine what proportion of the
total missing adult women are due to not having a husband. We see that this proportion in highest, at

Not being married explains the largest proportion of missing women in India, , approximately 40% of the
missing adult women are due to not having a husband. By comparison very little (13%) of the excess female
mortality in the youngest age category (15 - 29) is explained by not being married. In the older age categories
(50 to 69) it is approximately 20%.15
6. D ISCUSSION
We are absolutely explicit that our analysis is fundamentally an accounting device that exposes different
components of excess female mortality — non-marriage, in this particular instance — and contextualizes
those components relative to overall excess mortality. That said, the analysis is incomplete without some
discussion of the relevant pathways; specifically, the possible bias created by selection into marriage.
In the situation we study, there are three central differences between the region of interest and the reference
region. The first is the usual scale effect: because our regions are poorer, they exhibit higher death rates for
both men and women. The second difference is a corollary of these higher overall mortality rates: there is a
15

In Table A.1 of the Appendix, we present results analogous to those in Table 3 but at the country level. We restrict ourselves to
the sample of countries for which we have data on elevation ratios. Similar patterns emerge. The results for Bangladesh match
the estimates for South Asia (in Table 3) as a whole, where 27% of the overall excess female mortality is explained by not being
married. For countries within Africa we see that in Uganda and Malawi, 30% to 45% of excess female mortality is accounted for
by non-marriage (the estimate is 35% for all of East Africa according to Table 3). The patterns for countries in Southern Africa and
Northern Africa also match up. The estimate for South Africa in Table A.1 is 52%, whereas it is 53% for the region of Southern
Africa in Table 3. Likewise, the estimates for Egypt and Tunisia in Table A.1 are on par with those for the region of North Africa in
Table 3 (between 30% to 40%). Like the results in Table 3 for West Africa, we see in Table A.1 that very little of the excess female
mortality is explained by non-marriage in Burkina Faso and Senegal, less than 10%.

higher incidence of “non-marriage” (via widowhood and widowerhood) in our regions of interest.16 Finally,
there is a gender bias, reflected in varying elevation factors across women and men, with the resulting
relative elevation ratio then varying across the reference region and the region of interest.
6.1. The Scale of Mortality and Unbiased Death Rates. Following standard practice (for an extended
discussion, see Anderson and Ray 2010), the entire exercise presumes that the relative, age-specific death
rates in the reference region are the “unbiased” death rates, and it is precisely the departures from those
“reference rates” that generate our estimates. How appropriate is this choice? How do we know that genderbased death rates are not somehow “naturally” different at different levels of development?
This assumption is well-nigh impossible to test with available data. The best we could do is presume — at
least for a sizable set of countries once poor, or poor countries today — that there is no gender discrimination,
so that the relative rates in those countries are the “natural” relative rates. In our earlier work (Anderson
and Ray 2010) we did use Latin American and Caribbean countries as an alternative reference group. Our
estimates of excess female mortality for the age group 15–69 decrease by only 10%. So one might presume
that the reference regions are not far off the mark to begin with.
But there is a deeper conceptual reason: the use of any reference group that does not replicate what we see
in developed countries today runs the risk of burying important gender differentials under the cover of an
“alternative benchmark.” For instance, we could be labeling as natural and non-discriminatory the tendency
for females to die relatively more in developing countries. We see absolutely no reason why this should
be the case. In our opinion, it is far more satisfactory to presume that the “natural” relative death rates are
indeed constant with development, and then to view every departure from that benchmark as prima facie
cause for suspicion (though not as conclusive evidence).
6.2. Incidence of Widowhood and Elevation Ratios. Our principal focus is on differences in the incidence
of marriage as well as in the relative elevation ratios. As we explain in Section 2.3, our methodology allows
us to disentangle these two effects.
Approximately 34% of the missing unmarried women are in the older age groups 50 to 69. Our computations
demonstrate that excess female mortality amongst this older unmarried group is driven mainly by a high
relative incidence of widowhood in the regions of interest. It may well be that this marriage incidence effect
is not linked directly to gender discrimination, and is just the outcome of age/gender mortality correlations
with development. Further research is needed to identify exactly the sources generating the significant
excess female mortality from the absence of marriage amongst older women in parts of Asia and Africa.
For the 52% of missing unmarried women that are of reproductive age (between 30 and 49 years old), we
have demonstrated that it is the skewed elevation ratio effect that drives excess female mortality at these
younger ages. Younger unmarried women are missing not because their death rates are elevated relative to
their married counterparts — that is true of the reference region as well — but because the elevation factor
for women (compared to that for men) is relatively high in the parts of Asia and Africa we’ve studied. This
is plausibly due to limited access to resources and health care for women in this very socially marginalized
group.
That said, we want to be extremely cautious in interpreting our results as providing direct evidence of
discrimination.17 We do not want to assert that our numbers — large though they might be — fully represent
16

It is true that the incidence of marriage is typically higher in our regions, but this is outweighed by the higher mortality rates,
especially at later ages.
17
For instance, the dominance of the elevation ratio effect for younger women may come from the fact that the ages of their children
are relevant. Younger widows are likely to have younger offspring, who are less able to help look after them. To be sure, the
fact that this skews the relative elevation rather than simply raising the correction factors by the same proportion for each gender
continues to be suggestive of some form of female discrimination.

overt (or even implicit) discrimination against unmarried women. In general, there will be an entire complex
of social, behavioural, and economic pathways that will need to be invoked. Our objective in this paper is
simply to flag non-marriage as a factor in determining excess female mortality at older ages in a unified
and comparable way across developing countries. The numbers are striking: in each year, over 710,000
unmarried women are missing.
6.3. Selection Versus Protection. The very last of the three central differences enumerated above, which
is the variation of the elevation ratio across the reference region and the region of interest, will now be
examined more closely. The magnitude of any causal link between marriage and excess unmarried female
mortality is predictably hard to establish. In the literature examining the relationship between marital status
and mortality in developed countries, a long-standing debate attempts to disentangle the role of “marriage
protection” versus “marital selection” in explaining the observed differences (Goldman 1993, Sullivan and
Fenelon 2014). Much of that literature focuses on the role of “marriage protection”, i.e., the social, psychological, economic, and environmental benefits associated with having a spouse, that help to prevent
premature mortality. When those protections are removed, death rates spike. Bereavement is an important
reason, but it is not the only one. In developing countries, widowed women can suffer the vulnerabilities of
reduced social support (Kochar 1999, Chen and Drèze 1995a,b).
A competing explanation is the role of “marital selection.” For instance, if there is marriage sorting by economic or health status, the death rates of partners could be co-vary via socio-economic factors that influence
mortality (Bowling 1987). It is also possible for selection to occur via re-marriage as healthier individuals
are more likely to remarry (Sullivan and Fenelon 2014). This competing explanation is of particular interest
in our context, as it runs against the spirit of our exercise, which is to suggest that widowhood could precipitate excess female mortality. If selection is the dominant consideration that drives a high elevation factor,
then we could be attaching excessive importance to the widowhood argument.
6.3.1. Relative Importance of Protection and Selection. Obviously, it is practically impossible to conduct a
randomly controlled experiment to identify the relative importance of protection and selection. Researchers
have typically turned to large-scale individual-level longitudinal data to establish a causal role from marriage
to better health outcomes, controlling for observables most likely linked to selection into marriage. For
instance, Rendall et. al. (2011) conclude that these more recent analyses have led to a stronger case for the
“marriage protection” hypothesis:
“Positive selection on unobserved characteristics cannot be ruled out as at least a partial explanation for
our findings, and further efforts to model such selection are encouraged. However, the consistently negative coefficients for the unmarried of our study after controlling for observed socioeconomic and disability
variables are themselves stronger evidence in support of a marriage protection effect . . . ”
Moreover, as there does not appear to be significant differences in mortality rates for the different categories
of “non-marriage” (never married, divorced/separated, and widowed) it is difficult to argue that the particular
traits systematically determining worse health outcomes could simultaneously explain selection into these
different categories. Indeed, there appears to be general agreement that selection factors do not come close
to explaining all of the rise in spousal mortality; see, e.g., Allison and Christakis (2006), Boyle, Feng and
Raab (2011), Espinosa and Evans (2008), Martikainen and Valkonen (1996), and Waldron, Hughes and
Brooks (1996). In line with Rendall et al. (2011), Sullivan and Fenelon (2014) observe that “prior research
on this subject indicates that selection is not the most important explanation for the association between
widowhood and subsequent mortality.” Their best estimate is that “approximately one third of the increase
[in mortality rates] can be attributed to selection.” Nevertheless, we need to examine this issue more closely.
6.3.2. Accounting for Selection. How might selection affect the findings of our exercise? Recall our basic
equation that describes and decomposes excess female mortality at any age, reproduced here with the age

6.3.3. Selection and the Elevation Ratio θ. There are two levels at which selection might bias our estimates.
The first has to do with the “true” correction factor cw once selection is introduced. Second, there is the effect
on the elevation ratio θ. The latter effect is a bit more complex and we discuss that first before combining
both factors. As far as the elevation ratio is concerned, then, the magnitude of the effect we estimate
is threatened if women in developing countries experience a larger selection effect relative to their male
counterparts than they do in the reference region. In that case, by (11), the term θ that we compute would
be biased upwards relative to its true value, thereby increasing our estimates of excess female mortality
stemming from non-marriage.
For instance, it must be the case that marital sorting on health status in developing countries is more severe
relative to the corresponding sorting in developed countries, and that this severity impinges more heavily
on women. Moreover, given our estimates, such an argument would further require that this “double-skew”
of the sorting pattern is more prevalent in India (and East Africa) compared to other regions of Africa and
China.
This is a subtle argument. The assertion that mortality heterogeneity in developing countries is an order
of magnitude higher, or is more steeply related to income, may well be correct but it does not deliver the
required implication. As an example, Ram et al. (2015) observe that in 2014 India, “the roughly 10year survival gap between high-mortality and low-mortality districts was nearly as extreme as the survival
gap between the entire Indian population and people living in high-income countries.”18 If there is spatial
clustering in marriage, which is a reasonable position to take, it will lead to substantial selection effects,
quite plausibly higher than those in developed countries. But skewed selection is not implied. For that,
one would need to examine the ratio of female to male mortality, and how that affects the corresponding
elevation ratios that are used to construct θ.
Table 4 provides the required computations based on data from Ram et al. (2015). They divide the districts
of India into three mortality categories. The columns marked “m” and “w” show death rates per thousand
(for men and women respectively), and these do rise sharply across the three district groupings. The ratios
of these death rates by gender (shown in the columns marked “w/m”) are less variable, however, and are
suggestive of the possibility that there is little skew implied by selection per se. To confirm this, we compute
the implied elevation factors for men and women, marked êm and êw , that would be generated by these
numbers. For instance, êw would be calculated by first solving for the death rate of a widow were she to
be randomly drawn from any of the districts. If all women marry men from the same district (which is the
strongest case for selection in this example), this death rate would be high compared to the average death
rate for women in all districts. And indeed it is high, but there is no skew across gender.19 For comparison,
18We are grateful to an anonymous referee for bringing this reference to our attention, and for pushing us to discuss the implications

of spatial heterogeneity in mortality.
19Women tend to marry younger than men in India so that the selection effect could happen at different ages for men and women.
We’ve ignored that issue here. For it to change anything, risk selection into marriage be based not just on mortality levels but
also systematically on mortality-age profiles; i.e., differential selection based on how mortality changes with age. If, for instance,
all selection is based on mortality levels leaving mortality ratios across different ages unaffected, relative elevations will remain
unchanged.

Table 4. Relative Gender Mortality Across Low- and High-Mortality Districts of India, 2014. Sources and Notes.
Columns m and w depict mortality rates per 1000 from Table 1 of Ram et al. (2015). Columns w/m plot the relative mortality
rate. We compute implied elevation factors if it is assumed that all elevations come from selection into within-district marriage.
For instance, êw calculates the relative elevation ratio that would occur were a widow to be randomly drawn from any of the
districts, compared to the average death rate for women in all districts. The populations used to weight the death rates are also
taken from Ram et al. (2015); they are 137m, 148m and 143m (men 15-69) and 121m, 175m and 112m (women 15-69) for
low-, medium- and high-mortality districts respectively. Column êw /êm reports these relative implied elevation ratios and the
final column reports the actual relative elevation ratios, ew /em , used in our analysis.

we include the relative elevation factors that we used for our analysis in the last column, which indeed are
significantly skewed across gender.
This discussion also suggests that the skew induced by selection is smaller than the observed ratio of correction factors, so that the selection-adjusted ratio of correction factors is likely to be even larger than the
observed ratio. We use this information in the next section.
6.3.4. An Overall Assessment of the Importance of Selection. Of course, equation (10) also reminds us that
quite apart from the issues with changing θ, a higher death rate from non-marriage also contributes to excess
female mortality. This is the first term in equation (10): the larger the correction factor, the larger is our
estimate, and if some of that increase in the correction factor comes from selection, our estimates of excess
female mortality from non-marriage could be biased upward.
Suppose, then, that for the region of interest, a component s is equally responsible for elevated death rates
(under non-marriage) for both men and women. Recalling (5), we see that
cj = (1 − σ j ) + σ j (ej∗ + s)

(12)

for each gender j = w, m, where ej∗ stands for the elevation free of selection. For the reference region,
denote the corresponding selection component by λs, where λ = 1 if selection is equally strong in both
regions. So we have
b
cj = (1 − σ
bj ) + σ

(13)
again for the two genders w and m.

To interpret this derivative, evaluate it for small s. In that case EFM1 is at its true selection-free value. The
derivative then tells us how the estimated value we report moves away from the true value as we introduce
some selection. If the derivative is positive, our estimates are biased upward; if negative, then downward.
Everything in (16) is observed except for λ. However, the elevations in the reference region are of similar
magnitude for men and for women. If anything, they are larger for men, as Figure 2 reveals. The same is
roughly true of marriage rates in the reference region, though at advanced ages women are more likely to
be widowed than men; see Figure 1. So as a first approximation, we can think of b

Condition (18) is likely to hold. The right hand side is typically greater than 1 for each of the fractions,
since dw > rw — that’s where the missing women come from — and it is also true that σ w > σ m , because
rates of non-marriage for women are typically higher relative to men (due to higher rates of widowhood)
in the region of interest. Indeed, they are significantly bigger; the ratio typically goes between 2 and 3. In
contrast, on the other side we have cw /cm , which typically is not more than 1.1 or 1.2, and squaring it does
not increase it by much.
Given that the bias is positive; that is, (18) is positive, then we must try to estimate the size of this bias.
To address this, we have to make guesses about s. We can do this by using equation (12) and the existing
literature, which places s at about 1/3 of the total elevation (Sullivan and Fenelon 2014). That is, if total
elevation ew + s = 1.2, then s should be around 1/3 of 0.2, which is 0.07. There may be a corresponding
number for males but it seems reasonable to assume that the selection s should be the same — after all, the
couple lives together and that should add the same number to their death rate. So, using (17), we see that
the total correction is approximately:

Table 5. Excess Unmarried Female Mortality from Selection Bias (2005, in ’000). Sources and Notes. This table
uses equation (19) to estimate the number of unmarried missing women (in ’000) that can be attributed to selection. The last
column expresses this number as a fraction of overall excess female mortality from non-marriage. Sources: Global Burden
of Disease Study (2015), U.N. World Marriage Data 2012, U.N. Demographic Yearbook 2003, India Human Development
Survey (2005, 2011), Iganga/Mayuge HDSS (Uganda), Karonga HDSS (Malawi), Kaya HDSS (Burkina Faso), Mlomp HDSS
(Senegal), Nanoro HDSS (Burkina Faso), Bandafassi HDSS (Senegal), Niakhar HDSS (Senegal).

In Table 5, we compute the number of missing unmarried women in each age group that are due to selection
bias, using (19). We see that, for example, in India, this total is 19,550 in the year 2005. This makes up
approximately 8% of the total missing women due to non-marriage in India, which is the number reported in
the final column of Table 5. Overall, summing across all age groups for all regions, the number of missing
unmarried women due to selection bias is equal to approximately 62,000 out of our total, 712,000. That
implies that our estimates are biased upwards by approximately 9% due to selection.
7. C ONCLUSIONS
It is well known that the absence of marriage can pose significant risks, and that such risk can and does
manifest itself in higher mortality rate for the unmarried. In principle, this is true of both men and women.
There is a more subtle perception that the elevation of risk is higher for women then for men, and that this
relative elevation is particularly acute for developing countries. This is the starting point of our paper, which
attempts to establish the magnitude of this problem and situate it in a larger context: the phenomenon of
“missing women” or excess female mortality in developing regions.
The numbers we put on this phenomenon are quite remarkable. All told, there are approximately 1 million
missing women just between the ages of 30 and 49, each year. We find that 40% of these missing women
of adult age — 400,000 of them — can be attributed to “non-marriage,” which underlines the fundamental
relevance and importance of this issue. Further research is needed to identify exactly the sources generating
the significant excess female mortality for this very marginalized group of women.
