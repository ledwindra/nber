Political Distribution Risk and Aggregate Fluctuations

ABSTRACT
We argue that political distribution risk is an important driver of aggregate fluctuations. To that
end, we document significant changes in the capital share after large political events, such as
political realignments, modifications in collective bargaining rules, or the end of dictatorships, in
a sample of developed and emerging economies. These policy changes are associated with
significant fluctuations in output and asset prices. Using a Bayesian proxy-VAR estimated with
U.S. data, we show how distribution shocks cause movements in output, unemployment, and
sectoral asset prices. To quantify the importance of these political shocks for the U.S. as a whole,
we extend an otherwise standard neoclassical growth model. We model political shocks as
exogenous changes in the bargaining power of workers in a labor market with search and
matching. We calibrate the model to the U.S. corporate non-financial business sector and we back
up the evolution of the bargaining power of workers over time using a new methodological
approach, the partial filter. We show how the estimated shocks agree with the historical
narrative evidence. We document that bargaining shocks account for 34% of aggregate
fluctuations.

Introduction

The political process is an important driver of the income distribution. Collective bargaining
rules, hiring and firing restrictions, overtime provisions, minimum wages, or antitrust legislation
-among many other policies- affect the quantity and prices of labor and capital. Furthermore, these
regulations change over time, often suddenly and unexpectedly. For instance, a common event
after coups, democratic transitions, or party system realignments is a thorough modification in
labor market regulations and fast changes in the capital income share. The U.S. 2016 primary and
presidential campaigns illustrate the political viability of candidates with widely different agendas
regarding how labor and goods markets should be organized. In summary: political distribution
creates considerable income risk for workers and owners of capital.
We argue that this political distribution risk is a quantitatively relevant source of aggregate
fluctuations and asset prices. To do so, we first document the existence of the political distribution
risk through three empirical exercises. The first exercise is a collection of six case studies of countries
that undertook significant political events over the last few decades (France, West Germany, Spain,
Portugal, Argentina, and Chile). We show how these events were associated with considerable
changes in how income was divided between capital and labor and variations in stock market
valuation. The second exercise compiles international evidence on political events and factor income
distribution in 117 countries from 1970-2013. The third exercise analyzes the consequences for
distribution of the adoption of right-to-work legislation by several U.S. states. As an example
of the findings we uncover, the introduction of right-to-work legislation in a state is followed, on
average, by increases in the state capital share of 1.5-1.6 percentage points (pp.) relative to the
U.S. five years after adoption.
Next, we focus on U.S. aggregate fluctuations by estimating a Bayesian proxy-vector autoregression (VAR) for the U.S. economy. We proxy the redistributive shock by legislated changes in
the federal and state-level minimum wages. In different specifications, we document the significant
effects of redistribution shocks on output, factor shares, labor markets, and asset prices.
This evidence motivates a straightforward quantitative exercise.

We augment a standard

stochastic neoclassical growth model with labor search and matching à la Shimer (2010) with
shocks to the bargaining power of workers. These shocks are a simple way to capture a central
mechanism through which political distribution risk operates. Formally, political risk can be interpreted as arising from political influences on the protocol of an underlying dynamic bargaining
game (Binmore et al., 1986). In our model, this risk is separate from distributional changes due to
endogenous movements in the bargaining position of workers and firms since those movements are
reflected in the outside values of the agents.
We identify our model by exploiting the differences in responses of output and wages to shocks
to productivity and the bargaining power of workers. After both a positive shock to productivity
and a shock that lowers the bargaining power of workers, output grows. However, wages fall if
the former shock occurs, but increase if the latter shock hits the economy. Hence, looking at the
comovements of output and wages disentangles one shock from another.
2

With this identification, we calibrate our model to quarterly observations of the U.S. nonfinancial corporate business sector and the labor market. As a baseline, we look at long-lived
bargaining shocks with a half-life of 34 quarters. Thus, our approach deals not only with standard
business cycles, but also with medium-term aggregate fluctuations. The half-life of 34 quarters is
based on our reading of the changes in political climate regarding the bargaining power of workers
in the post-war U.S. and matches the average duration of control of the different branches of the
federal government by each party after WWII. As a robustness check, we explore the behavior
of the model with even more persistent bargaining shocks (half-life of 80 quarters) and with less
persistent ones (half-life of 14 quarters, a standard business cycle persistence). Fortunately, the
qualitative dynamic properties of the model are not substantially affected by this persistence.
We solve our model using a third-order perturbation since we document how the non-linear
features of the solution can be significant. For example, distribution shocks in favor of labor are
more important when the bargaining power is already biased against capital. These non-linearities
also mean that we must calibrate the model to match the moments of its ergodic distribution and
not its steady-state properties.
A central part of the paper is to use U.S. data to back up the bargaining shocks implied by
our quantitative model. We do so by proposing a partial filter, a new methodological contribution
of broad applicability. The central idea of the partial filter is to take one of the key optimality
conditions of the model (in our case, the wage-setting equation), substitute the different conditional
expectations of a product of variables by their conditional covariance plus the product of conditional
expectations of single variables, and approximate those conditional covariances and expectations
of single variables from a Bayesian VAR (BVAR). The procedure can be implemented with a
Gibbs sampler and it is much less involved than a sequential Monte Carlo filter such as those
in Fernández-Villaverde et al. (2016). The backed-up shocks agree with our detailed historical
narrative evidence, with peaks at moments of large labor union victories (i.e., the 1970 GM strike)
and troughs at moments of weakness of unions (i.e., the early 2000s).
To assess the business cycle properties of our model, we compare it with a version of our model
without bargaining shocks, with a benchmark real business cycle (RBC) model with productivity
shocks, and with an RBC model augmented with factor share shocks in the production function
(as in Rı́os-Rull and Santaeulàlia-Llopis, 2010, and Lansing, 2015).
Besides the backed-up bargaining shocks, our most significant findings are as follows. First,
our model replicates the near acyclicality of wages and output that has been difficult to match
with other business cycle models. In our model, output can increase either because productivity
grows, which raises wages, or bargaining power shifts toward capital, which lowers wages. As we
mentioned before, we use these two opposite forces to identify and calibrate our model. Hence,
this result, although interesting in so far as it shows the doors that our model opens to understand
aggregate fluctuations, cannot be used to assess the validity of the model. But this finding allows
us to discriminate between models. An RBC model with factor share shocks yields wages that are
too pro-cyclical: a shock toward labor makes it more productive and, thus, raises wages.

3

More relevant for assessing the model is the second finding: our model accounts very well for
the pro-cyclicality of the capital share and reasonably well for the pro-cyclicality of the net capital
share (i.e., after depreciation). This stands in stark contrast to the version of the model without
bargaining shocks and the RBC models (with and without factor share shocks). This result is
robust to changes in the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor in the production function. When we impose a low elasticity of substitution of 0.75, consistent with U.S. manufacturing
estimates (Oberfield and Raval, 2014), or a high elasticity of 1.25, consistent with cross-country
estimates (Karabarbounis and Neiman, 2014), our model still replicates the cyclicality of the capital
and net capital shares, while the other models do not.
Our third finding is that the bargaining shocks account for around 34% of the volatility of
output and nearly all of the model-generated volatility of capital shares (which is, itself, around
40% of the observed one). When the model is calibrated to match observations from the U.S. labor
market, the surplus of the labor relation is small. Minor variations in how this surplus is allocated
induce substantial changes in the number of recruiters that firms employ to hire new workers.
This leads to lower output and employment, but also to higher wages. We illustrate this point
with a parallel experiment. The U.S. has benefited from a more stable capital share than other
industrialized countries. For example, the overall volatility of the capital share is about 40% lower
than in the U.K. If increased redistribution risk would cause the capital share to become 40% more
volatile, our model predicts output and consumption volatility that is 20% higher. This increased
volatility would lower the welfare of the representative household by 0.9% of consumption.
Finally, we look at the dynamic effects of a bargaining power shock, and we perform a battery
of robustness exercises. We document, for example, how after a bargaining shock that redistributes
in favor of workers, output, employment, and firm valuation drop and how trying to endogenize
the bargaining shocks to make them dependent on the business cycle does not affect our main
results. But perhaps most interestingly, bargaining shocks have larger output effects in a polarized
environment. When the share of the surplus going, for instance, to capital is already low, further
redistribution in favor of workers has a deeper impact as it makes even small amounts of recruiting
effort by the firm unprofitable.
Our paper builds on a large previous literature. For example, the recent evolution of the
capital share has commanded much attention (e.g., Autor et al., 2017; Barkai, 2017; Elsby et al.,
2013; Karabarbounis and Neiman, 2014; Koh et al., 2015; Oberfield and Raval, 2014). Some of
the proposed explanations highlight technological change, the fall in the relative price of capital,
increases in firm concentration, globalization, or the role of intellectual property products. For
our investigation, we can remain agnostic about these mechanisms. Our point is not that all
sources of fluctuations in the capital share have a political origin: we only claim that part of
them do. Furthermore, we will focus more on short- and medium-term fluctuations around a trend
than on the trend (although we perform some high-persistence exercises). One should expect that
the effects of technological change or structural transformation on factor shares would manifest
themselves more clearly in the trend than in middle- and high-frequency movements.

4

Previous work has also focused on how changes in the bargaining power affect factor shares. Examples include Blanchard (1997), Caballero and Hammour (1998), Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003),
and Kumhof et al. (2012). The first three papers above are concerned with the trend decline in
the labor share in Europe, whereas we focus on aggregate fluctuations. Unlike our work, Kumhof
et al. (2012) link shocks to bargaining power to changes in income inequality. Gertler et al. (2008)
and Liu et al. (2013) also allow, in passing, for time-varying bargaining power, but they do not
study its implications in full. Contemporaneous with us, Foroni et al. (2017) have presented VAR
evidence of the importance of bargaining supply shocks in employment fluctuations. Rı́os-Rull and
Santaeulàlia-Llopis (2010) interpret redistribution shocks as technological shocks to the production
function. As we will see later, our model outperforms an RBC model with factor share shocks in
terms of matching important aggregate fluctuation statistics.
Our bargaining shocks resemble wage markup shocks such as those in Galı́ et al. (2012). There
are some important differences, though. First, our model endogenously generates the equivalent to
state-dependent markups over disutility because the surplus of the match is time-varying. Second,
we document the importance of higher-order effects related to labor market tightness. These
effects are absent in models with markup shocks. Third, and most important, we link our shocks
to a precise historical narrative. For instance, our partial filter points out that, from 1950 to
the late 1970s, the evolution of bargaining power mostly followed the fate of unions (except for
the Kennedy-Johnson wage-posting guidelines). After 1980, changes such as Reagan’s regulation,
Clinton’s welfare reform, immigration, and labor market policies such as minimum wages and
unemployment extension played a bigger role.
We also link with papers dealing with wage bargaining and aggregate fluctuations. This literature is too large to do justice to it in a few lines, but we can highlight the textbook treatment
in Shimer (2010) (with all the references therein), and the influential contributions of Hall (2005),
Hall and Milgrom (2008), Gertler and Trigari (2009), and Christiano et al. (2016). Interestingly,
Shimer (2005) pointed out the potential of bargaining power shocks for resolving the unemployment volatility puzzle, but emphasized the need for clear identification. Our paper focuses much
attention on identification and on the close link between historical evidence and the bargaining
shocks.
More broadly, our paper relates to the literature on the asset pricing implications of macro
models with production. Our work is closer to Danthine et al. (2008), Lansing (2015), and Greenwald et al. (2014). These authors argue that distribution risk can be important for explaining asset
prices. But it remains unclear, in these papers, what is driving the fluctuations in the factor shares.
We provide evidence and a model that allows us to quantify both the endogenous and exogenous
factors behind the changing capital share.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the historical evidence
documenting how political interventions affect factor shares. Section 3 systematizes the data using
a Bayesian proxy-VAR estimated with U.S. data. In Section 4, we present and compute our model,
and we take it to the data in section 5. Section 6 explains our partial filter and the backed-

5

up evolution of the bargaining power in the U.S. Section 7 presents the quantitative results and
Section 8 reports the dynamic effects of bargaining power shocks. Section 9 concludes. An appendix
discusses further details of the data, empirical exercises, model, computation, and results.

Factor shares: Historical evidence

In this section, we present historical evidence regarding the evolution of factor shares across many
countries and the role that political interventions may have in them. In the next section, we
will focus our investigation on U.S. data using structural VARs. We start, however, with a brief
discussion about measurement and stylized facts.

2.1

Measurement and basic facts

How does the capital share of income evolve over time? While the definition of this share is
conceptually straightforward, its measurement presents challenges. For instance, we need to allocate
ambiguous sources of income such as copyright payments, deferred compensation, or proprietors’
income between labor and capital. Also, we must make a decision about how to impute indirect
taxes. Finally, for going from the gross to the net share, we need to take a stand on depreciation
rates. Gomme and Rupert (2004, 2007) discuss the measurement issues in the U.S. and Gollin
(2002) analyzes proprietors’ income in a cross-section of countries.
In Appendix A, we give an overview of different measurements of the capital income share in the
U.S. economy. Suffice it to say that these alternative calculations agree among themselves regarding
the behavior of capital income share over middle and business cycle frequencies (see Figure A.2
in the Appendix). Thus, for many of our purposes, picking one measure or another in the U.S.
case is inconsequential (a similar point is made by Muck et al., 2015b). On the other hand, across
countries, our empirical statements may depend on available data.

Figure 1(a) shows annual data, taken from Piketty and Zucman (2014), over long horizons for the
net corporate capital share for France, the U.K., and the U.S. The net corporate capital share moves
in parallel with the gross capital share in panel (b). The former is particularly informative about
the incentives faced by investors: since it eliminates depreciation, it uncovers the compensation for
intertemporal substitution, precautionary motives, and risk-taking. The data reveal three facts.
First, when we concentrate on the corporate sector of the economy –the object of interest in our
model– in none of the three countries does the capital share display an apparent trend, although one
can see some increase at the end of the sample.1 Second, there has been, nevertheless, significant
movement in the capital share over time, including larger movements before WWII and a recent
increase in the capital share. Third, the U.S. has exhibited the least volatile capital share among
the three countries, 30% less volatile than in France and 40% less than in the U.K.

The top panel of Table 1 lists the raw and HP-filtered volatility of the gross capital shares for
our three countries. The bottom panel shows that income shares are much more volatile in the
U.K. than in the U.S. even after controlling for industry composition (and, hence, reducing the
effect of structural transformations and technological change). For France, the same is true only in
the raw data, but not after detrending. Lastly, while the standard deviation of the capital share of
income fell in the U.S. in the post-WWII period by around 43%, it decreased around 65% in the
U.K. and 73% in France.

1

Rognlie (2015) has documented that the recent increase capital income share in the overall U.S. economy was
driven by the housing sector and not by the corporate sector. Nevertheless, our model later in the paper can handle
long-lived increases in capital shares (in one calibration, with half-lives of 80 quarters).

2.2

Factor shares and policy changes: International evidence

We will argue now that the timing of policy changes and subsequent swings in the capital share of
income across many countries suggests that the latter can be partially accounted for by the former.
We will complete this section by focusing on data from the U.S.
To investigate the effect of policy changes, we use three panel data sets on factor shares. Our
baseline is the OECD Business Sector Data Base underlying Blanchard (1997).2 These data are
available over longer horizons and at a higher frequency than the measures in the Penn World Table
(Feenstra et al., 2013) and Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014). The OECD Business Sector Data
Base provides information on the gross capital share in the business sector, independent of whether
businesses are private or public, or whether they are incorporated. The second data source covers
the annual net capital share in Latin America and the Carribean and is compiled by the Economic
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC). This data set includes all sectors of
the economy. Our third data source covers the gross capital shares in all private industries in U.S.
states after 1963. We define the capital share as the reciprocal of the labor share of income.
2.2.1

Case studies

As a first exercise, Figure 2 summarizes six case studies. In each of them, momentous political
changes were accompanied by significant movements in factor shares. While the panels in Figure 2
are not a formal econometric assessment (we avoid such an exercise due to data and identification
limitations), all six cases are suggestive that economic policy can have a material effect on income
distribution between labor and capital. To show that this phenomenon affects countries with
different levels of income per capita, we selected two rich economies (France and West Germany),
two upper-middle-income economies (Spain and Portugal), and two lower-middle-income economies
(Argentina and Chile).
Our first case study, in panel (a), is France. After the big strikes of 1968 (first vertical line),
successive French governments introduced ambitious pro-labor measures (see Caballero and Hammour, 1998, for a detailed list of these policy changes in favor of labor approved between 1968 and
1983). The capital income share declined continuously during this period. This process culminated
in 1982 when Mitterrand was elected as the first socialist president of the Fifth Republic on a
left-wing platform (second vertical line). We see the capital share fall slightly after his election.
The worsening economic conditions forced Mitterrand to appoint Laurent Fabius as his new prime
minister on July 1984 (third vertical line), to drop his alliance with the French Communist Party,
and to inaugurate an era of more market-friendly policies, a focus on price stability, and wage
moderation. After that change, the capital share of income started growing.
Panel (b) shows the case of West Germany. The appointment of Willy Brandt as the first Social Democratic chancellor since 1930 correlated with a sharp drop in the capital share. A famous
example of the changes introduced by the Social Democrat-led government was the strengthen2

The graphs show the gross capital share and stock market indices for France, West Germany, Spain, Portugal,
Argentina, and Chile. The data are at lower frequencies for capital shares. Overlaid are black vertical lines that
indicate major political events as described in the main text. The capital share data for Argentina come from
Lindenboim et al. (2005) and Kidyba and Vega (2015). No continuous time series on the capital share is available
for Chile, so we show the spells of available data. Stock market indices are broad indices, except for Chile where we
use the financial stock index. The indices are deflated by consumer prices.

ing of the role of workers’ councils in its 1972 reform of the Betriebsverfassungsgesetz (the legal
framework for worker co-determination within firms). Later, under Helmut Schmidt, the realm of
co-determination was extended to all companies with at least 2,000 employees, rather than just the
steel and coal industry. This increase in the power of workers was halted and partly reversed when
the Christian Democrats returned to power in October 1982 (second vertical line). For instance, in
1986, the Christian Democratic-led government changed the Arbeitsförderungsgesetz (the Employment Promotion Act) to limit the strike tactics of unions. This policy reversal coincided with an
increase in the capital share.
Our third case study is Spain (panel (c)). The last years of Franco’s dictatorship were associated with increasing labor unrest, the breakdown of the system of government-controlled corporatist
unions (“Organización Sindical Española”) that had repressed wage growth, and a profound economic crisis. The capital share of income and the stock market plummeted. Only after 1982, with
the election of the surprisingly pro-market Felipe González’s government and the implementation
of a wage restraint policy, did the capital share of income recover.3
Our fourth case study is Portugal. Panel (d) documents how, after the Carnation Revolution
on April 25, 1974, the capital share fell precipitously. The Processo Revolucionário em Curso
opened by the sudden change of political regime saw widespread nationalizations, an aggressive
land reform, and a new collective bargaining environment tilted in favor of workers. After the
failed pro-communist coup of November 25, 1975 and the return to more market-friendly policies
that followed the democratic normalization, the capital income share quickly recovered but without
ever reaching the levels seen during the authoritarian Estado Novo.
Argentina is our fifth case (panel (e)). In this country, the principal political events were the
coups against Juan and Isabel Perón on September 16, 1955 (the so-called revolución libertadora)
and on March 24, 1976, and the beginning of the current democratic era in 1983. Juan Perón,
according to the “Marcha Peronista,” knew how to win over the people by fighting capital.4 In
contrast, both coups brought considerably more business-friendly governments to power and virulent anti-labor-union policies. Panel (e) shows the subsequent increases in the capital share of
income. After losing the Falklands War, the military called for general elections that led to the
presidency of Raúl Alfonsı́n on December 10, 1983, and a subsequent drop in the capital share.
Our final case is Chile. Panel (f) plots the behavior of the capital income share and an index of
the stock market in Chile throughout four periods: the Unidad Popular government of Allende (the
area between the first two vertical lines), Pinochet’s dictatorship (the area between the second and
third vertical lines), the governments of Aylwin, Frei, and Lagos -the moderate left-wing first three
democratic presidents after Pinochet (the area between the third and fourth vertical lines), and,
finally, the more left-wing first presidency of Bachelet (the area to the right of the fourth vertical

The Spanish lyrics refer to Juan Perón as follows: “¡Viva Perón! ¡Viva Perón! / Por ese gran argentino / que se

great Argentinian who knew how to conquer the great mass of the people by fighting against capital!”

line). While we do not have a continuous time series, Panel (f) shows a sharp drop in the capital
income share around the time of the election of Allende, a socialist candidate who supported a
vigorous pro-labor agenda. The capital share recovers quickly around Pinochet’s coup, with its
violent policy against worker’s unions, and falls after the transition to democracy and the return
of a friendlier environment for workers’ political action.
Figure 2 suggests that stock markets tend to move with the capital share. In Appendix C.1, we
formalize this notion and also consider employment changes (output effects are harder to measure
because of the presence of trends). We show that stock markets and the employment-to-population
ratio tend to move in the same direction as the capital share around the above events. Specifically,
the two-year changes in capital shares show a moderate to strong correlation with changes in the
employment-to-population ratio and the real stock index over the same period with an R2 between
0.25 and 0.33.
2.2.2

Labor regulation and capital shares

The previous case studies suggest that political changes are often followed by redistribution of
income between capital and labor. But how do political events affect the capital share? And
how general are our case studies? While one could think about different mechanisms linking
policy and income distribution (fiscal and monetary policy, competition policy, etc.), a channel that
impacts directly on income shares is variations in labor regulation. Thus, we employ data on labor
regulation, capital shares, and the timing of coups or democratic transitions to econometrically
assess the link between policy changes and income shares.
Our data on labor regulation come from Adams et al. (2016). This group of legal scholars
maintains an annual data set that quantifies labor regulations in 117 countries from 1970–2013. It
contains 40 separate indicators that cover five areas: (1) the definition of employment, (2) working
time, (3) dismissals, (4) employee representation, and (5) collective action. Each indicator measures
the degree of worker protection from [0, 1] – a mix of binary, ordinal, and cardinal measures. The
measure is designed to cover both statutory and case law.5 We use an equal-weighted average of
the available indicators as our measure of labor regulation.
Because labor regulation could evolve in response to changes in the state of the economy, we
also look at large political events that are often dictated by exogenous shocks such as wars, internal
conflicts, or deaths of political leaders: successful coups and democratic transitions. We define a
successful coup as Powell and Thyne (2011) do and a democratic election as a legislative election
in a parliamentary system or a presidential election in a semi-parliamentary or presidential system
according to Bormann and Golder (2013). We then look at changes between a coup-regime and a
democratic regime. Our prior is that democratic changes tend to favor labor (as most voters are
wage-income earners) and assign these changes a value of +1, whereas coups receive a −1. Table 2
5

It is possible that the data set is imperfect in its coverage of case law. For instance, in the U.S., it records
only one change from 1970 to 2013, the 1987 WARN Act. However, Budd (2012) characterizes the recent history of
U.S. labor law as having by “static” statutes and “dynamic and voluminous“ case law. Incomplete coverage should
resemble classical measurement and bias our results toward zero and, therefore, against our hypothesis.

Table 2: Political events used as predictors for labor regulation changes
Figure 3 shows the change in labor regulation and its correlation with changes in the capital
share. We focus on cumulative three-year changes and standardize the data to ease interpretation.
The left panel shows a negative correlation between capital share changes and labor regulation
changes that favor workers (leaving out periods of no variation in regulation). The sparser right
panel conditions on political transitions. Labor regulation weakly falls in all coups (red circles). In
turn, democratic transitions (blue diamonds) mostly correlate with higher worker protection and
declines in capital shares. Uruguay is a clarifying example of how we separate observations. In the
left panel we see observations for this country for 1972 and 1973. In 1972, Juan Marı́a Bordaberry
became president and initiated an aggressive conservative policy. However, Bordaberry’s accession
to power was democratic. In comparison, on June 27, 1973, Bordaberry closed the parliament
and inaugurated a civic-military dictatorship that repressed trade unions and jailed many or their
leaders. We code 1973 as a coup.
We now formalize the associations in Figure 3 with a regression design. Figure 4 shows the
results when we look at cumulative three-year changes since a political event.7 The left panel
shows that for coups, worker protection via labor regulation is eased, whereas the opposite is true
after democratic events. A democratic transition tends to raise worker protection by one-third of a
standard deviation. The t-statistic of 2.3 corresponds to an F -statistic of 5.2 and cannot fully dispel
weak instrument concerns. The middle panel shows how this predicted change in labor regulation
is associated, on average with a large 6.9 pp. drop in the capital share following tighter regulation.
Given that a regime switch induces a change of one-third of a standard deviation, a political regime
switch is associated with a change in the capital share of about 2.3 pp. OLS, run on the same
sample around political events only, produces a slightly smaller estimate of 5.2 pp.
6
Although a coup could be pro-workers, none of those appear in our sample. In particular the Carnation Revolution in Portugal did not overthrow a democratic government and, thus, our algorithm does not code it as a coup.
Instead, the algorithm codes the election in 1976 as the democratic transition, even if history suggests that the actual
event was the army rising up against the dictatorship in 1974. We use 1974 for our benchmark results.

We take the capital shares from various sources, but only one per country to avoid splicing the data. Because

Figure 3: Capital share changes and labor regulation changes
To show that the 19 political events our algorithm identifies are not spuriously correlated with
large changes in labor share, we compute placebo effects. For each country, we randomly pick dates
for coups and democratizations with equal probability, respecting their alternating order. We code
the first event date with equal probability as a coup or democratization. Each subsequent event, if
any, is then coded as the other type. Thus, we have the same number of event dates per country as
in our actual sample, and we can apply the same IV analysis as in our benchmark case. We repeat
this process 1,000 times and show the distribution of placebo and actual t-statistics. Figure 5
shows that the probability of finding second-stage t-statistics is below 1% independent of using all
countries with events, only event episodes, and whether, for Portugal, we use 1976 (as suggested
by our coding algorithm) as the event year instead of 1974 (as suggested by our reading of history;
see the Portugal row in Table 2).

Figure 5: Placebo test: Political events, labor regulation, and capital share changes
Our finding that politics affects the labor share through labor regulation is also robust to
various specifications; see Table 3. Importantly, the results change little if we condition on the
capital share and per capita GDP growth prior to the political event. The capital share change is,
thus, neither driven by reversion to the mean nor by cyclical factors. Allowing for common factors
across countries matters little. Broadening our sample to include all countries with political events
weakens the estimated effect of a one standard deviation change in labor regulations, so that a
one standard deviation change in labor regulation leads to a considerable decline in the capital
share of 4 pp. While all the OLS estimates point in the same direction as the IV estimates, they
are smaller when using all available years for countries with political events. If labor regulation
is tightened when the economy is expanding, the pro-cyclicality of the capital share could explain
this attenuation. Classical measurement error would have the same effect.
Tables C.2 and C.3 in the Appendix report how the results hold for additional specifications:
following our algorithm blindly by assigning 1976 as the democratization date for Portugal, examining only changes within the year of the political event or labor-regulation change, and using
all countries for which we have labor share and capital share data with OLS. As one would have
expected, the effects over three-year periods are stronger than over one-year periods.

2.3

Factor shares and policy changes: U.S. evidence

The U.S. has had the good fortune of avoiding the radical political events we used to identify
exogenous drivers of labor regulation in our international analysis. At the level of U.S. states,
however, there is direct evidence of the effect of policy changes on the labor share. Right-to-work
legislation was aimed at limiting the bargaining power of unions by allowing employees to opt out
of union membership. Did it succeed?
We use data on states that were late to adopt right-to-work legislation to analyze its effects on
the capital share. While most right-to-work states enacted the underlying laws in the first decade
after 1945, six states (Idaho, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Indiana, and Michigan) adopted
this legislation between 1963 and 2012, the period for which we have data on their private-industry
labor share. Among these, Indiana and Michigan were the most recent adopters in 2012.
The data from Idaho, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Wyoming indicate increases in the capital

“5y FE” refers to a fixed effect for the five-year period surrounding the event. “Initial conditions” are the level
of capital share and real per capita GDP growth in the year prior to the estimation period. In the baseline IV
regressions, we only include countries with political events, as defined in the main text. Alternatively, we also include
all observations for the countries with political events. Standard errors are clustered at the country level and the
state-country level when estimated with fixed effects.

share after right-to-work legislation was passed, but with different dynamics. However, three to
five years after the adoption of right-to-work legislation the capital share in all four states has risen
relative to that in the U.S. (see Figure 6; capital shares are computed as one minus the share of
employees’ compensation in state GDP net of taxes and subsidies). For Indiana and Michigan,
their capital share increased in 2013 and 2014, both in absolute terms and relative to that in the
U.S. as a whole, but with only two observations, we must be most cautious.
To gauge the statistical significance of the previous numbers, we also use industry-level variation
from these states. We find that in most specifications, the increase in the capital share following
right-to-work legislation is positive with two-sided p-values below 0.1 after five years. We can
reject the null of decreases in the capital share after right-to-work legislation in most cases. The
exception is when we satiate the regression with state, year, and industry fixed effects. Slightly less
demanding regressions robustly confirm the increase in the capital share. Note that the permanent
effect of the right-to-work legislation is ambiguous – potentially because eventually labor-intensive
industries disproportionately flock to right-to-work states.
We also look at the effects of right-to-work legislation on economic activity. While the evidence
on differences in private-sector real GDP growth is less pronounced, GDP growth weakly increases
three to five years after a state adopts right-to-work legislation (see Figure D.7 and Table D.4 in

analyze the effects of right-to-work legislation on the location of manufacturing and find positive
effects on manufacturing activity. To provide more detail on the economic dynamics following a
redistribution shock, we now turn to a VAR estimated for the U.S. economy.

Factor shares: VAR evidence

Besides changing the bargaining power of workers, the government can directly affect how the
surplus is split between firms and workers by mandating a minimum wage. As Flinn (2006, p.
1014) points out: “Increases in the minimum wage can be viewed as a way to increase their [i.e.,
workers’] “effective” bargaining power.” Even though less than 10% of hours worked in the U.S. are
paid at or below minimum wage (Autor et al., 2016), increases in statutory minimum wages often
spill over to higher wage groups due to indexing or tournament wage structures. For the U.S., Lee
(1999) estimates that the spillovers are big enough to account for more than 100% of the change in
the ratio of the 50th to the 10th wage percentile after a decline in the real minimum wage. More
recent work by Autor et al. (2016) finds smaller spillovers of 30-40%. Similar findings are reported
by Kearney and Harris (2014), who argue that the “ripple effects” of an increase in the minimum
wage will raise the wages of nearly 30% of the workforce.

Figure 7: Change in the corporate capital share and real change in the statutory federal minimum
wage.
Motivated by these results, we analyze how changes in the statutory federal minimum wage
impact the capital income share. In Figure 7, we show how the corporate non-financial capital
share changed relative to the real change in the statutory minimum wage.8 Once we exclude the
outlier in 1950, we find a robust negative relationship between changes in the statutory minimum
wage and the capital share that explains about 18% of the variation in the observed capital share
(reported p-values are based on White robust standard errors).9
8

We focus on the original federal minimum wage that covered only employees engaged in interstate commerce.
From 1961 onward, other federal minimum wage rates were introduced. These were lower until 1978, when they were
replaced by a single minimum wage. See https://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.pdf. To convert the statutory
change to 2000 USD, we divide the change by the level of the PCE deflator relative to the year 2000.
9
On January 25, 1950, the minimum wage increased from $0.40/hour to $0.75. However, given the limited
coverage of minimum wage at the time (it only covered workers employed by firms engaged in interstate commerce)
and the prevailing wages in the industry for low-skill workers (well above $0.40/hour), the real effects of this sharp
increase in the minimum wage were likely limited. Furthermore, using a robust regression that drops any observation

17

To move from these simple scatter plots to a formal estimation, we use a proxy-VAR. Our
proxy for the redistributive shock is the legislated change in the federal minimum wage, converted
to constant year 2000 USD - similar to the instrumental variables strategy in Autor et al. (2016).
Under the assumption that the federal minimum wage legislation is uncorrelated with other shocks,
this procedure identifies the response of the economy.
The assumption that statutory minimum wage changes are uncorrelated with other shocks allows
us to identify a redistribution shock without any additional restrictions, such as zero restrictions
on impulse-response functions (IRFs) common in the VAR literature. Technically, our proxy-VARs
is a Bayesian version of the original frequentist approach in Stock and Watson (2012) and Mertens
and Ravn (2013). We use the Bayesian implementation in Drautzburg (2016) with a flat prior.
Under the assumption that the proxy is a valid instrument, the proxy-VAR identifies the IRFs
from the covariance of forecast errors and the proxy. The algorithm also allows us to purge the
proxy from other predictors, which we exploit in robustness checks.
We estimate a small VAR that captures the labor market, the goods market, and the capital
share. The VAR has four variables: (1) the real minimum wage, (2) the unemployment rate, (3) the
net capital share in the non-financial corporate business sector, and (4) gross value added (GVA)
in the overall non-farm business sector. Our data are quarterly and we include four lags. We begin
our estimation in 1951, excluding the apparent outlier in 1950 and allowing us to keep the sample
constant when we later extend the VAR. In the main text, we focus on specifications without
any trend. Figure E.8 in the Appendix shows that our results change little with a deterministic
quadratic trend.
Figure 8(a) shows the IRFs to a 10% minimum wage increase in the full sample, a typical increase
in the postwar period. Both for the full sample (top row of panels) and for the post-Volcker era
(middle row), statutory minimum wage increases cause the real minimum wage to rise persistently,
a redistribution effect. The capital share falls significantly on impact in the full sample by between
0.1 and 0.7 pp. with 68% posterior probability. Unemployment increases with a delay and peaks
0.3 to 0.9 pp. higher after about one year. Gross value added falls by 2% one year after the shock.
In the post-Volcker era, the effects are similar for the unemployment rate and value added, with a
more pronounced effect on the capital share that is delayed by one quarter and also peaks within
one year. Except for the insignificant value added response, the results are stronger for the postVolcker sample. The lower share of hours worked at or below the federal minimum wage rate – a
peak of 9% in 1980–81 and a low of 3% in 2002–06 (Autor et al., 2016, Table 1B) – may explain
the delayed effect on the capital share as indirect equilibrium effects become more important than
direct effects. In the post-Volcker sample, there is also some predictability in statutory minimum
wage changes that are our shock proxy and that is not captured by the small-scale VAR. Controlling
for the level and the square of the capital share, the minimum wage, and the unemployment rate
(Figure 8(c)), the IRFs show a shorter, more plausible shape (see the next paragraph for further
motivation for these controls).
with Cook’s distance greater than 1 (a standard choice in the literature), only the 1950 observation is eliminated.

Figure 8: Responses to a 10% real minimum wage shock in VAR.
One concern about our identification procedure could be that Congress increases minimum
wages when the labor share is too low or the economy is performing well. However, if the information
set in the VAR is rich enough to capture the state of the economy well, our results cannot be
explained by current economic conditions. To see this, note that the estimation in Drautzburg
(2016) is based on the covariance between the proxy, here the statutory minimum wage changes,
and the VAR forecast errors. Because the forecast errors are orthogonal to the state of the economy
as captured by the VAR, our results would not change if we further controlled for any linear
combination of the lagged VAR variables in the proxy variable itself. Only variables outside our
VAR or non-linear combinations of VAR variables could change our results. In this four-variable
VAR, our information set may be small. Hence, we consider additional non-linear controls to purge
our proxy variable. Specifically, we only use the variation in statutory minimum wage changes that
is orthogonal both to the level and the squared values of the real minimum wage, the capital share,
and the unemployment rate. For the full sample, the differences are minimal. For the post-Volcker
sample, purging the proxy of these past predictors makes the identified shock more transient, but
otherwise changes little; see Figure 8(c). Another approach to making sure our results are not
driven by predictable variation in the proxy variable is to enlarge the information set in the VAR.
To check this, we estimate a 10-variable VAR in Appendix F. We also estimate versions of the
VAR that incorporate information on changes in state-level minimum wages and with different
trends/subsamples. Our results are basically unchanged.

Model

In the previous two sections we have presented evidence on various legal ways that politics influences
labor shares in the data. We now present a parsimonious model of such measures as determinants of
the wage bargaining process. More concretely, we propose a quantitative, discrete-time stochastic
neoclassical growth model with labor search and matching in the tradition of Andolfatto (1996),
Merz (1995), and Shimer (2010). In the model, there is a representative household, a final good
producer, and a government. Markets are complete. To make the model closer to the data along
important dimensions for our exercise, we add taxes on labor income and net corporate profits,
adjustment costs in capital, and variable capacity utilization.
We postulate political shocks to factor income shares as innovations to the bargaining power of
workers. As Binmore et al. (1986) show, variations in the bargaining power can arise from changes
in the bargaining procedure. These changes correspond in the data with innovations in labor law,
judicial decisions, and, more generally, the political climate regarding collective bargaining. As we
will see, the capital income share in the steady state is mostly pinned down by deep parameters
other than the bargaining power. In contrast, shocks to the bargaining power will have significant
transient effects. In the next subsections, we present the key model ingredients, while we relegate
to Appendix G the full description of the model.

4.1

Households

There is a representative household formed by a continuum of individuals of measure 1. Each
individual can be either employed or unemployed, but they are otherwise identical in terms of
preferences. The household perfectly insures its members against idiosyncratic risk by equating
marginal utilities. Under this perfect insurance assumption, the household problem can be recast
in terms of the following lifetime utility function:
U0 = E0

∞
t
X
Y
t=0

!
mt

(ct − (1 − τn )wt nt−1 − Tt ).

(4.2)

s=0

In the utility function, β is the discount factor, ct is the average consumption, and nt−1 ∈ [0, 1]
is the fraction of household members who are employed at time t, a fraction that, as we will explain
below, was determined in the previous period (and hence the subindex t − 1). The parameter σ
controls the relative risk aversion and γ the disutility of working.
In the budget constraint, a0 is the household net worth at time 0 and mt is the stochastic
discount factor that transforms net income in each period into present valuations (with m0 = 1).
Net expenditures are given by consumption less after-tax labor income and Tt , the lump-sum
20

transfers from the government and the net profits from the ownership of firms (capital is owned
directly by the firm; under complete markets, this is equivalent to capital being owned by the
household, but more convenient algebraically). Labor income is determined by the wage wt and it
is taxed at a rate τn .
When making its decisions, the household considers that workers lose their jobs at rate x and
find new jobs at rate f (θt ), where θt is the recruiter-unemployment ratio that the representative
household takes as given. Thus, the fraction of household members employed next period will be:
nt = (1 − x)nt−1 + f (θt )(1 − nt−1 ).

(4.3)

The job finding rate, f (θt ), is given by f (θt ) = ξθtη , with matching efficiency ξ and elasticity η.

4.2

Firms

There is a representative firm that allocates the matched workers nt−1 between recruiting (a fraction
νt ) and producing the final good (the remaining fraction 1 − νt ). The latter are combined with the
capital owned by the firm, kt−1 , to produce a homogeneous final good with the technology:
 1
 ε
1
1
1
ε−1
yt = α ε (ut kt−1 )1− ε + (1 − α) ε (egz t zt (1 − νt )nt−1 )1− ε
,

(4.4)

where ε is the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. For ε → 1, we obtain a CobbDouglas production function with capital share α. A labor-augmenting trend productivity growth
is given by gz and a productivity shock by zt . Finally, ut is capital capacity utilization.
For an investment it , capital kt evolves as:
kt = (1 − δ(ut ))kt−1 +

where δ̃ ≡ gz1−α − (1 − δ(ū)) depends on gz , the growth rate of zt . The utilization cost is:
1
δ(u) = δ0 + δ1 (u − 1) + δ2 (u − 1)2 .

(4.6)

The firm’s value is determined by the discounted flow of post-tax revenue less investment and
labor payments:

where τk is the tax on corporate profits net of a depreciation allowance. Production and capital
follow from (4.4) and (4.5) and employment growth at the firm level satisfies:
nt = (νt µ(θt ) + 1 − x)nt−1 ,
21

(4.7)

where µ(θt ) = f (θt )/θt is the hiring probability per recruiter.

4.3

Wage determination

Households and firms determine the wage under generalized Nash bargaining. Workers have bargaining power φt . As mentioned before, we view exogenous shifts in φt as capturing political and
legal shocks (i.e., an administration that appoints more union-friendly board members at the NLRB
or a major decision regarding labor relations by the Supreme Court of the United States), as well
as potentially other shocks (for example, a structural change in the economy such as a move from
manufacturing factories to decentralized services that make it difficult for workers to take collective
action).10
The equilibrium wage, thus, solves the following problem:
wt = arg max Ṽn,t (w̃t )φt J˜n,t (w̃t )1−φt ,
w̃t

where Ṽn,t and J˜n,t are, respectively, the marginal values of employment for the worker and the
firm given an arbitrary wage w̃t for the current period and wt thereafter. In equilibrium, of course,
w̃t = wt . We derive Ṽn,t and J˜n,t in the Appendix from the recursive formulation of the household
and firm problems.

4.4

Exogenous processes

In our economy, two variables evolve exogenously: labor productivity zt and the bargaining power
φt . Labor productivity follows:
ln zt = ρz ln zt−1 + ωz z,t
where |ρz | < 1 and z,t is a normalized Gaussian shock. In the Appendix, we allow for ρz = 1 (i.e.,
permanent shocks to labor productivity). The bargaining power follows:
ln

φt
φ̄
φt−1
= (1 − ρφ ) ln
+ ρφ ln
+ ωφ φ,t
1 − φt
1 − φt−1
1 − φ̄

φt
where the transformation ln 1−φ
maps the level of the bargaining power from [0, 1] to (−∞, ∞)
t

and φ̄ is the average value of the process. Again, |ρφ | < 1 and φ,t is a normalized Gaussian shock.
In contrast to other papers, we hold the matching efficiency ξ constant to isolate more transparently the effects of innovations to bargaining power.

10

Binmore et al. (1986) show that the static bargaining problem is the limit point of a sequential strategic bargaining model. In such a sequential bargaining model, φt reflects asymmetries in the bargaining procedure or beliefs
about the likelihood of a breakdown of negotiations. Their model, therefore, provides a micro-foundation for how
policies that change the bargaining procedure induce changes in φt if the parties to the bargain are impatient.

22

4.5

Market clearing and equilibrium

Aggregate employment must follow the law of motion for the representative household (4.3), where
the recruiter-unemployment ratio satisfies:
θt =

nt−1
νt .
1 − nt−1

(4.8)

The resource constraint in this economy is standard: the production of the final good equals
aggregate consumption and investment.
yt = ct + it .

(4.9)

Finally, aggregate capital has to satisfy the capital law of motion for the representative firm (4.5).
The equilibrium stochastic discount factor, which follows from household optimization and
market completeness, is:
mt+1 = βt

σ
c−σ
t+1 (1 + (σ − 1)γnt )
σ
c−σ
t (1 + (σ − 1)γnt−1 )

.

(4.10)

In the Appendix, we derive a more general discount factor that allows for external habit formation.
In equilibrium, households choose consumption and employment optimally, taking the process
for the wage rate, the real interest rate, and labor market tightness as given. Similarly, firms
choose investment, utilization, capital, production, and recruiting optimally, taking the process
for the wage rate, the stochastic discount factor, and labor market tightness as given. The goods
market also clears at the equilibrium choices.
In the spirit of Hosios (1990), Appendix G.5 shows that allocations along the balanced growth
path are constrained efficient if φ = 1−η and τn = τk . If workers’ bargaining power or the corporate
tax rate is too high, the value of employment to firms and recruitment are too low.

4.6

Mapping theory into data

There are two sources of value added in our model: final goods production and matching workers
and firms. Thus, we define real output yrt to be the sum of final goods production and the cost of
recruiting:
yrt ≡ yt + νt nt−1 wt .

(4.11)

The cost of recruiting is not accounted for in NIPA as an intermediate output, but as added value,
since it corresponds to wages paid to workers hired to undertake this task.
The capital share is defined relative to this measure of output. Specifically, we use the following
measures of the gross and net capital share in our economy:
nt−1 wt
,
yrt
nt−1 wt
kt−1
ncst ≡ 1 −
− δ̄
.
yrt
yrt
cst ≡ 1 −

23

(4.12a)
(4.12b)

In the model, depreciation changes with the endogenous utilization decisions. In comparison, the
depreciation rate in NIPA varies over time only because the capital stock changes its composition.
Because we have a single good in our economy, we choose to measure the NIPA equivalent of the
net capital share using the steady-state depreciation rate. This computes the net capital share
under the assumption of a constant service life of an asset.11
Finally, measured total factor productivity (TFP; hereafter we will omit “measured,” but TFP
should always be understood as such) is equal to
T P F = GDPt − cst kt−1 − (1 − cst )nt−1 .

(4.13)

Before solving our model, we HP-detrend all variables as needed. To compute business cycle
statistics in the following sections, we compute quarterly averages and add the trend to all trending
variables before HP-filtering. In the model, labor productivity, capital, consumption, investment,
the marginal value of employment, the marginal product of labor, and wages grow at the common
rate gz , while all other variables are stationary.

4.7

Solution

We use a third-order perturbation to solve for the equilibrium of the detrended economy. This
approach allows us to analyze some non-linear dynamics of interest and delivers higher accuracy.
For example, the mean Euler equation errors are below 0.5% of consumption and the 99th percentile
of Euler errors is around 1.5% (see Appendix G.11).12 To ensure stability, we apply the pruning
method developed by Andreasen et al. (2017).
In the neighborhood of the calibrated, detrended steady state (see Section 5), the capital share
is almost invariant to the bargaining power. In the long run, the capital share is overwhelmingly
determined by technology and preferences. In our baseline calibration, 31 out of the 31.2 pp.
of the gross capital share are compensation for depreciation, impatience, and growth. Instead,
employment moves to equate the marginal product of labor to the varying wage rate (adjusted
for recruiting costs). For the same reason, the rental rate of capital and the marginal product of
capital are also nearly invariant to the bargaining power for a wide range of calibrations.13
11

Per capita consumption is defined as the sum of real consumer non-durables and consumer services. Per capita
investment is defined as real gross domestic private investment plus real durable consumption. Because only nominal
or quantity indices are available for private consumption expenditures, we compute real consumption expenditures
in 2009 dollars as the product of the per capita quantity index times their average 2009 nominal expenditures. Per
capita GDP is defined as real per capita investment plus consumption. For variable mnemonics and exact series
definitions, see Appendices A and G.8.
12
Petrosky-Nadeau and Zhang (2013) argue that a partial equilibrium search-and-matching model close to ours
exhibits non-linearities that a second-order perturbation does not capture adequately. But their model has an
occasionally-binding inequality constraint on posting vacancies that complicates the computation of the solution.
The analog in our model is the fraction of recruiters, νt . In general equilibrium, νt does not get to zero: because of
the concavity of the recruiting technology, firms always want to have at least a small positive fraction of recruiters.
Thus, our solution is much easier to compute.
13
When we re-calibrate the disutility of working to keep employment constant, the capital shares are independent
of φ̄. The matching efficiency ξ is calibrated for any given average employment level n̄ to ensure that the balancedgrowth path recruiter-employment ratio θ̄ is constant across parameterizations. Then, the optimality for recruiting

Taking the model to the data: identification and calibration

We calibrate our model at a monthly frequency to U.S. data. As described in Andreasen et al.
(2017), we will match moments in the data to the corresponding moments of the model’s ergodic
distribution, and not to their steady-state values. We do so because, under a non-linear solution,
the latter may not summarize well the properties of ergodic distributions.

5.1

Technology and preferences

We start by selecting a Cobb-Douglas production function, with ε = 1, as in Cooley and Prescott
(1995) and many others. Alternatively, we will consider values of ε = 1 ± 0.25, reflecting the recent
work of Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) and Oberfield and Raval (2014). The former estimate
the elasticity of substitution of 1.25 using long-run differences across countries. The latter estimate
a macro-elasticity of substitution for the manufacturing sector of 0.7 based on a weighted average
of micro-elasticities of substitution and demand. Also, after Cooley and Prescott (1995), we select
gz to be 1.6% per year.
We choose the discount factor β, the share of capital in production α, and the depreciation
rate δ to match three properties of the non-financial corporate business sector: (1) the gross capital
share of 31.2%, (2) the ratio of depreciation to gross value added of 12.7%, and (3) the (annualized)
ratio of capital to gross value added of 2.3. We calibrate the average corporate tax rate to 30%,
the average observed in the data. Given our choice of gz , the implied annual depreciation rate is
5.5% and the annualized discount rate is 0.976. The corresponding capital share α depends on the
elasticity of substitution, but is simply 0.31 in the Cobb-Douglas case.14
Next, we calibrate the labor market following Shimer (2010, p. 80f.). The exogenous separation
rate x is 3.3% per month, the average unemployment rate is 5%, and the matching efficiency ξ is
such that one recruiter hires, on average, 25 employees per quarter. We set the matching elasticity
η and the average bargaining power φ̄ to 0.5. As in Prescott (2004), a labor income tax rate of
40% combines the consumption taxes and the actual labor tax rate. Choosing a conventional value
of σ = 2 implies that consumption complements labor moderately and that the employed consume
30% more than the unemployed.

5.2

Stochastic processes

The stochastic processes for zt and φt are indexed by their persistences, ρi , and standard deviations,
ωi , for i ∈ {z, φ}. Following Cooley and Prescott (1995), we set ρz = 0.951/3 , a standard value.
This leaves us three parameters to determine: ρφ , ωz , and ωφ . Given that we do not have direct
observations of the bargaining shocks, we will proceed in two steps. First, we will describe the
and the production function imply that the wage, GDP, final output, the number of recruiters, and the capital along
the balanced-growth path are constant as well.
14
While the calibration of the model is not fully recursive, in practice it is nearly so (i.e., we can calibrate one
block of parameters, move to calibrate another one, and so on, and only have to do minor readjustments at the end).
Thus, to simplify the exposition, we discuss separately in the text the different blocks of parameters.

will explain how we explore a wide range of values of ρφ to capture different views on the persistence
of bargaining shocks.

Figure 9: Steady-state response to shocks.
The first step is illustrated by Figure 9, where we show the response of the fraction of recruiters,
unemployment rate, and wages to shocks to the bargaining power and labor productivity.15 In the
top panels, we see that, after innovations to the shocks that deliver either higher bargaining power
for workers, φt , or lower productivity, zt , the optimal recruiting decision for the firm that relates
the unemployment rate, 1 − nt , and the fraction of recruiters, νt , moves to the right. In both cases,
the firm finds it less profitable to recruit new workers: either the firm appropriates a smaller share
of the match surplus or workers are less productive. Thus, 1 − nt increases (and output falls) and νt
falls after both innovations. The bottom panels of Figure 9 document that, in comparison, wages
increase after an increase in bargaining power, but fall after a decrease in productivity. Higher
bargaining power for workers lowers output and the match surplus, but because their share in the
surplus rises enough, workers still take home a higher wage. In summary: higher worker bargaining
power and lower productivity lower output, but have an opposite impact on wages.
Thus, we can exploit observations on wages, output, and TFP to pin down the size of bargaining
power shocks and productivity shocks. More concretely, given ρφ , we pick ωz and ωφ to match the
15

To plot the four panels, we assume permanent shocks, keep consumption constant after each shock, and use our
baseline calibration in Table 5. With the full transient dynamics, the panels would be harder to read. However, the
intuition of the identification result remains fully unchanged.

26

observed correlation of wages with GDP and –recall equation (4.13)– the volatility of TFP.16 Given
ωz , a higher ωφ lowers the correlation of wages and GDP. This trade-off is illustrated by the left
panel in Figure 10. The green horizontal line gives us the observed correlation of wages and GDP
and the decreasing curves the model-implied correlation for different values of ωφ (with κ that
matches the volatility of investment at the preferred calibration).
Note, however, that we plot three different lines, each corresponding to a different value of
ωz (and, as before, conditional on ρφ ). We can improve the sharpness of the identification if we
simultaneously calibrate the standard deviation of productivity shocks, ωz , to match the volatility
of TFP (middle panel of Figure 10), and the investment adjustment cost, κ/δ02 to match the relative
volatility of investment (right panel). The horizontal lines in the figure indicate HP-filtered data
moments.17 Intuitively, the larger the standard deviation of productivity, the larger the standard
deviation of the bargaining shocks that matches the cyclicality of wages. Fortunately, productivity
shocks are the main driver of TFP and, thus, we can easily identify these parameters together.
Last, the relative volatility of investment to GDP pins down the investment adjustment cost.
While changing this parameter has next to no impact on the cyclicality of wages, it has a large
impact on investment. We match the relative volatility of investment, because recruitment is also a
quasi-investment activity that we want to discipline indirectly by getting capital investment right.
Figure G.14 plots the additional bivariate relation among these three parameters and documents
why we can ignore, for calibration purposes, the omitted plots.

Figure 10: Identifying ωz , ωφ , and κ/δ02 .
Thus, it only remains to pick the persistence of the bargaining shock, ρφ . Since we are agnostic
about how persistent this shock is in the data, we will select three cases. As a baseline medium-term
case, we set ρφ = 0.981/3 . This value implies a half-life of the shock of 34 quarters.18 From 1948
16

At a quarterly frequency, Cooley and Prescott (1995) find an autocorrelation of 0.95 and a standard deviation of
0.73% for TFP. Averaging monthly observations within quarters, their values correspond to a monthly autocorrelation
of 0.951/3 and a standard deviation of TFP productivity of 0.73%. We find a value of 0.76%.
17
We also set the elasticity of utilization with respect to the marginal product of capital to 21 (i.e., δ2 = 2δ1 ).
18
Note that 34 quarters is above the conventional 32-quarters cut-off of business cycle frequencies. Thus, we are
dealing with a shock that generates medium-term business cycles as in Comı̀n and Gertler (2006). In the interest
of space and to allow an easy comparison with the literature, most of our quantitative results will focus more on
business cycle fluctuations. We will make some references, however, to the longer-lived effects of the shock.

to 2016, the average duration of a party’s control of the presidency has been 30.2 quarters, of the
Senate 38.9 quarters, and of the House of Representatives 24.7 quarters (the Democrats started
1948 already in control of the presidency and the current Republican control of the Senate and
the House is ongoing, so our numbers are slightly biased downward).19 Given that the changes in
party control that resulted in small changes in policy (Truman followed by Eisenhower, Bush Sr.
followed by Clinton) have been roughly the same as the changes that resulted in more substantial
policy shifts (Carter by Reagan, Bush Jr. by Obama), 34 quarters is a reasonable duration for
the half-life of the middle-run political cycle in the U.S. after WWII. Given this ρφ = 0.981/3 ,
the monthly standard deviation of the bargaining power shock of 6.9 pp. and κ = 0.075/δ02 . In
addition, ρφ = 0.981/3 approximately coincides with the features of the U.S. labor income share’s

case studies of Section 2. We recalibrate all other parameters of the model accordingly.
Third, as a low-persistence scenario, we set ρφ = 0.951/3 , which yields a half-life of around 14
quarters. This low-persistence case matches the same persistence for the bargaining shock as for
the productivity shock, and thus it embodies a degree of parsimony and “standard” business cycle
properties. For this persistence, we also recalibrate all other parameter values.

5.3

An RBC model calibration

For comparison purposes in the results section, we formulate an RBC model à la Hansen-Rogerson
where we eliminate the search and matching frictions. We calibrate the model using the same
targets as for our baseline economy to pin down the ωz and κ (given the known properties of this
model, we need to give up on matching the cyclicality of wages). In that way, we can benchmark our
model against the behavior of a well-understood environment. For better comparison, labor supply
is determined one period in advance, but wages are set on the spot market. The counterpart model
is described in detail in Appendix G.14 and its quantitative properties are reported in the rows
labeled “RBC model” in Table 7. As an additional exercise, in Subsection 7.1, we will calibrate a
version of this RBC model where we add exogenous shocks to the factor shares in the production
function (as in Rı́os-Rull and Santaeulàlia-Llopis, 2010, and Lansing, 2015).

Quantitative results I: Historical bargaining power

Do the data, analyzed through the lenses of our model, support our calibration of the bargaining
power process? Is the process we calibrate consistent with the historical evidence? In this section,
we argue that the data broadly confirm our empirical approach. We document, first, that the
implied bargaining power process covaries meaningfully with historical U.S. events. Second, we
show that the statistical properties of the bargaining power process closely match our model.
We use a new methodology, which we call the partial filter, to back out the bargaining power
process from the data because a full-information particle filter is hard to implement. First, our
model is a simple two-shock economy without the bells and whistles present in many New Keynesian
models designed to account for many observables. Second, our pruned solution features a large
number of state variables and non-linearities that would require a high-dimensional particle filter.
Our filtering strategy, instead, exploits the structure of the key equations of our economy to deliver
a simple statistical model that recovers the bargaining power. Indeed, we call our filter partial
because, importantly, we do not have to filter all the states and it uses only some of the equilibrium
conditions of the model. Methodologically, the central insight of our proposal is to move from
unobserved expectations in the equilibrium conditions to conditional first and second moments
that can be described using (potentially time-varying) VARs. Hence, our partial filter can be
potentially applied to many contexts, including non-linear Phillips curve models and others.

29

6.1

The partial filter

Bargaining power enters into our model only through the wage-setting equation (G.25) (see Appendix G for the tedious, but straightforward derivation of this equation). Hence, it is natural to
use the wage-setting equation to recover the historical bargaining power implied by the theory and
data. The challenge is, however, that this equation features firms’ expectations. Specifically, we
need to model the expectation of the discounted future value of employment to firms times their
relative bargaining power. A full-information approach would rely on a non-linear filter, such as
a sequential Monte Carlo filter (Fernández-Villaverde et al., 2016), to filter all the states of our
non-linear model and back out the relevant expectation.
Instead, we use an auxiliary statistical model and firms’ optimality conditions to model the
expectations. To do so, we take advantage of two results. First, for any two random variables
(xt , yt ), we have that Et [xt+1 yt+1 ] = Covt [xt+1 , yt+1 ] + Et [xt+1 ]Et [yt+1 ]. Second, firms’ equilibrium
conditions allow us to write the product of the conditional expectations in terms of time t observables. This leaves only the unknown covariance of the random variables, which we estimate with
a statistical model. Conditional on an estimate, the bargaining power is the value that makes the
wage-setting equation hold.
Specifically, Appendix G.12 shows that we can re-write the wage-setting equation as:

function of consumption and employment. Labor market tightness θt is the ratio of vacancies to
the unemployed. We then use a simple Bayesian VAR that includes the discounted match surplus

For details, see Appendix G.12.21 There we describe how we scale the observed variables to
match the steady state of our model. By construction, we match the positive steady-state surplus
to households and firms in our model, but these match surpluses would turn negative in some
periods. We guarantee that the discounted match surplus is positive by first adjusting mplt so that
it lies weakly above the real wage. We then lower the average disutility of working, such that the
implied bargaining power averages 0.5 in our sample when the covariance terms are set to zero.22
Last, we adjust the frequency of the model to quarterly data. We use a flat prior in the estimation.

Results

The blue solid line charted against the left axis in Figure 11 shows the implied path of the bargaining
power process. We focus, first, on the medium-term fluctuations. Our sample starts at the time
of a large victory for labor, the so-called “Reuther’s Treaty of Detroit,” a 5-year contract between
GM and the United Automobile Workers (UAW) and named after the UAW’s president, Walter
Reuther. As one astute contemporary economist observed: “The inclusion of the modified union
shop in a five-year contract and the conciliatory approach of the corporation in bargaining have
finally convinced the union leadership, it appears, that GM has accepted the UAW on a realistic
and permanent basis” (Harbison, 1950, p. 404). The Treaty of Detroit opened two decades of gains
for workers across many industries and sectors in the U.S. economy (Levy and Temin, 2007). Even
Eisenhower appointed Martin P. Durkin, a former union leader, as his first Secretary of Labor and
his second Secretary of Labor, James P. Mitchell, has been inducted into the Labor Hall of Honor.
Proposed right-to-work laws were defeated in California, Ohio, Colorado, Idaho, and Washington
(Dubofsky and Dulles, 2017, loc. 7891). In line with these events, our bargaining power increases
from 0.5 to levels close to 1 by the end of the 1950s.
21

We initialize the process at our calibrated parameters and discard draws from a burn-in period. A time-varying
VAR would yield a time-varying sequence of covariances that would match our non-linear model more closely. We
abstract from this non-linearity because the covariance terms are small and the posterior uncertainty about the
in-sample bargaining power is neglible.
22
Adjusting mplt instead does not allow us to match the average bargaining power without turning the firms’
match surplus negative for some periods.

However, the end of this decade saw, as documented by Figure 11, the start of a relative decline
in worker’s power. Several factors contributed to it. First, the American Federation of Labor (AFL)
and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) merged in 1955. The merger led, after a few
years, to a more moderate attitude by the unions formerly associated with the CIO and a smaller
effort in increasing unionization rates. Richard Lester, a prominent Princeton labor economist at
the time, labeled the new AFL-CIO a “sleepy monopoly.” Also, the merger of both federations
facilitated the purge of the few remaining communist sympathizers at the CIO. Second, many
firms, worried by increasing foreign competition and rising costs, adopted the so-called “hard-line”
position of 1958, which after several years of industrial conflict (as in the steel industry in 1959),
led to some victories for management. Third, the Landrum-Griffin Act of 1959, a response to
corruption and racketeering in the labor movement, imposed additional guarantees regarding the
internal behavior of unions and tightened the rules regulating secondary boycotts, “hot cargo”
agreements, and recognitional picketing. These measures curbed the tactics of some unions, which
called for many fewer strikes in the early 1960s than in the late 1950s. As Walter Reuther put it
in 1960: “We are going backward.”
The decline in workers’ bargaining power continued until the mid-1960s when it was back at
around 0.5. This trend was helped by the wage-price guideposts started by Walter Heller at the
Council of Economic Advisors in 1962 and pushed by Johnson as an essential tool of the economic
policy of his administration. Although often remembered due to the fight between Kennedy and
the steel industry in 1962, the wage-price guideposts probably slowed down wage increases relative
to productivity growth (see the narrative in Slesinger, 1967).
The late 1960s saw, in comparison, lower unemployment, an economy running at high utilization
rates (although those factors are endogenous in our model), and the renewed strength of unions,
often led by a more militant, younger generation that had experienced the civil rights struggles, the
anti-war movement, and the radicalizing influence of the New Left. One of these new union leaders,
Leonard Woodcock (the successor of Walter Reuther as president of the UAW after Reuther’s
untimely death), organized the nationwide UAW strike against GM in September, 1970, which
lasted for 67 days. This strike was one of the biggest victories of the post-WWII labor movement:
UAW members received complete cost-of-living wage adjustments and a “30-and-out” retirement
plan (i.e., full pension after 30 years of work regardless of age). Our partial filter identifies as one
of its local peaks precisely 1970.Q4.
The early 1970s were an Indian summer for U.S. unions and industrial workers (see, again,
Levy and Temin, 2007). But the effect of the oil shocks and a changing political climate eroded
the bargaining power of workers by the late 1970s, perhaps best represented by the failure of the
1978 proposed reform of labor law, an endeavor in which the AFL-CIO had invested considerable
political capital, and the peak in unionization coverage and membership percentages in 1979 (Hirsch
and Macpherson, 2003).
This process sharply accelerated with Reagan’s arrival at the White House and his notorious
firing of striking air-traffic controllers in 1981.Q3 (whose full repercussions were only felt in the

33

second half of the 1980s). For the next two decades, our backed-up bargaining power series nearly
uninterruptedly drops to well below 0.5. Reagan was followed by Bush Sr. and Clinton, a probusiness Democrat who signed the welfare reform act in 1996.Q3, lowering many workers’ outside
option at the time of bargaining. Simultaneously, the significant immigration of the 1980s-2000s
(spurred by the somewhat delayed effects of the 1965 Hart-Celler Act) created many service-sector
workers with fewer historical links to the labor movement.23
The late 1990s and early 2000s saw, according to our partial filter, a stop in the negative
trend of workers’ bargaining power. The 1997 Teamster strike, the arrival of John Sweeney to
the leadership of the AFL-CIO, and the creation of the Change to Win Federation in 2005 did
not return organized labor to its former glory, but, at least, stabilized bargaining power somewhat
below 0.5. The bargaining power partially recovered in 2008.Q4, when the unemployment benefit
extensions raised the outside option of many workers,24 with the electoral victory of Obama –the
most pro-union president in a generation– and later with some early successes of the “fight for $15”
and the slowdown in immigration.
While our stylized two-shocks economy cannot hope to match all the richness of the data,
our comparison of Figure 11 with the historical narrative above demonstrates a surprising level of
agreement. In Appendix G.12, we compare our results with an alternative bargaining power index
proposed by Levy and Temin (2007). The fact that both indexes display a considerable degree of
comovement reinforces our positive assessment of our partial filtering exercise.
Of course, there are aspects that we miss. For example, our filter shows increases in workers’
bargaining power during recessions (shaded lines in Figure 11). Our model requires such countercyclical bargaining power to account for the fluctuations in the data. Even if the model is consistent
with the observations, we acknowledge that we may miss additional aspects such as unemployment
benefits with endogenous duration that, in a richer model, would affect the outside option, but not
necessarily bargaining power. We view this parsimony as a positive feature of our investigation,
but we also consider the role of endogenous bargaining power below by introducing a reduced-form
policy rule, which will not change the main thrust of our results.25
Besides the previous narrative, the statistical properties of the bargaining power process are
very close to the model; see Table 6. With a flat prior, the median posterior persistence is 0.9741
per quarter with a 90% credible set of (0.9511, 0.9957). The posterior for the conditional standard
deviation is 0.1720 (0.1611, 0.1851). These values come close to our calibration of ρφ = 0.9800
and ωφ = 0.2775. The posterior for the covariance is close to zero with a 90% credible set of
(0.0008, 0.0030). Appendix G.12 shows that when we use an alternative measure of labor productivity or the employment-to-population ratio, and detrend non-stationary variables before filtering,
we find only small changes in the implied moments. See Table G.6. The same appendix also dis23

These benefits peaked in mid-2010; see Figure A-4 in Hagedorn et al., 2013
25
Other alternatives could include a richer heterogeneity, with job ladders or learning-on-the-job, that vary across
the cycle, affect wages, and that our model may miss. An interpretation of our results in Figure 11 would be the
“aggregate” bargaining power that such models with heterogeneous workers should be able to match.

Quantitative results II: Business cycle statistics

We move now to assess the business cycle properties of the model. Table 7 compares U.S. business
cycle statistics to those of our search and matching (S&M) model (with and without bargaining
shocks) and its RBC counterpart. We focus on statistics that describe the volatility, persistence,
and cyclicality of aggregate variables. All business cycle statistics are based on HP-filtered quarterly
variables, averaged across 3 months in the model simulations. We take logs of level variables before
filtering, but filter variables that are ratios as such. We construct GDP per capita as the sum of
real per capita consumption and investment to match the data with our model.
In the data, the volatility of (log) GDP is slightly less than 2.0% per quarter. Investment is 3.28
times as volatile as GDP, whereas consumption is only 0.58 times as volatile. With correlations
of 0.91 and 0.84, both investment and consumption are highly pro-cyclical. Similarly, both the
gross and the net capital share are pro-cyclical (with a correlation of 0.57 and 0.36 respectively),
but less so than consumption and investment. All variables are very persistent, with quarterly
autocorrelations of 0.67 to 0.90.
How does our model compare to the data? Recall that we calibrated the standard deviation of
the capital adjustment cost to match the volatility of TFP (1.21%) and the relative volatility of
investment (3.28) and consumption (0.58). Thus, it is not surprising that this calibration delivers
nearly the exact level of GDP volatility (2.01). If we eliminate the bargaining shock (but keep
all the other parameters, including adjustment costs, at their baseline value), the volatility of
output drops 34% to 1.31; compare the row “S&M model: baseline” with “No bargaining shocks”
in Table 7). Without bargaining shocks, the performance of the model in terms of the relative
volatility of investment and consumption is still satisfactory.26
26

As a robustness check, we tried an alternative exercise where we calibrated the model with productivity shocks,
but without bargaining shocks. Then, we measured the effects of introducing bargaining shocks while keeping all the
other parameters constant. The results were nearly identical. In particular, the difference in the explained share of
GDP fluctuations by bargaining shocks was within 1 pp.

Note: Quarterly data, HP-filtered with smoothing parameter λ = 1, 600. We average the monthly model-generated
data first within quarters before HP-filtering.

The model with “no bargaining shock” fails, however, to generate any meaningful fluctuations
in the gross capital share and only around 17% of the fluctuations in the net capital share. Instead,
our baseline model with bargaining shocks can account for slightly less than 20% of the volatility
of the gross and 34% of the volatility of the net capital share in the data.
The baseline model also captures the cyclicality and persistence of the capital shares well.
With respect to cyclicality, the model overstates a bit the cyclicality of the net capital share and
understates that of the gross capital share. In comparison, the model with “no bargaining shock”
does considerably worse regarding correlations of the gross and net capital shares, with correlations
counterfactually close to 1. Without bargaining shocks, the only moves in these shares come from
changes in capital and the outside value in the bargaining protocol and both mechanisms are weak.
With respect to the autocorrelation, the model with bargaining shocks matches the autocorrelation
of the net capital share in the data of 0.76 almost exactly and, with a value of 0.66, understates
the empirical autocorrelation of the gross capital share of 0.74 only slightly. The model with “no

36

bargaining shock” does somewhat worse matching these autocorrelations.
By construction, our baseline model generates a nearly acyclical wage: the correlation of output
and wages is 0.19 both in the model and in the data. The procyclicality of wages in productivitydriven models (higher productivity increases the marginal productivity of labor and, with it, wages)
is compensated by the bargaining shocks. A shock that lowers wages is also expansionary (it
increases the returns to capital and, thus, investment in physical capital and recruiting and with
them, output in the following periods). This mechanism is sufficiently strong to nearly wipe out
any correlation between wages and output.
The three panels in Figure 12 complete this discussion by showing the explained standard deviation of GPD and the gross capital share as a function of the standard deviation of the bargaining
and productivity shocks and the investment adjustment. Only the size of the bargaining shocks
has noticeable effects on the volatility of the capital share.

7.1

Comparison with an RBC model

Could a standard RBC model account for the same features of the data as our search and matching
model with bargaining shocks? To answer this question, we report in the rows “RBC model”
in Table 7 the quantitative properties of the RBC model à la Hansen-Rogerson introduced in
Subsection 5.3 (see, also, Figures G.24 for the full set of impulse response functions with unitary
elasticity of substitution and Figures G.25 and G.26 for the corresponding figures with elasticities
of ε = 1 ± 0.25.)
The RBC model fails to account for labor market statistics (the cyclicality of wages and unemployment) and for the fluctuations of the net capital share induced by changes in depreciation (by
construction, this RBC model cannot generate any volatility in the gross capital share when ε = 1;
we will relax this assumption below).
One could follow Rı́os-Rull and Santaeulàlia-Llopis (2010) and Lansing (2015) and introduce
shocks to the factor shares in production within the RBC model. However, these shocks move real
wages in the same direction as output: A negative shock to the factor share of capital lowers the

37

productivity of capital and, via the marginal product of labor, also the real wage. Thus, the real
wage remains perfectly procyclical even with the additional shock.
To illustrate this point, we calibrate a version of the RBC model with factor share shocks to
generate the same volatility of TFP and relative volatility of investment as our baseline model
(see rows “RBC model with factor share shocks” in Table 7). Because both factor share shocks
and productivity shocks generate pro-cyclical wages and highly volatile TFP, their volatility is
unidentified from our calibration strategy. We thus set the volatility of productivity to 0.05% and
calibrate the volatility of the factor share to match the volatility of TFP. Note that the correlation
of the real wage is unchanged after such a shock relative to the standard RBC model. Figure G.27
shows that the real wage remains pro-cyclical in response to factor share shocks.

7.2

Extensions and alternative calibrations

We next analyze how our results change with several model extensions and alternative calibrations.
In each version of the model, we recalibrate the model to hit our target moments. Figure 13
provides an overview. It decomposes the standard deviation of GDP, the gross capital share, and
the net capital share into the contribution from productivity only and the additional contribution
due to bargaining power shocks. The contribution to GDP of bargaining power shocks varies from
8% to 69% while the contribution to the gross capital share varies from 6% to 29%, compared with
our baseline result of a 34% and 17%, respectively. Most model variants roughly match the overall
output volatility but explain only up to 40% of the volatility of gross capital share. In the next
subsections, we discuss in detail each of the columns in Figure 13.
7.2.1

The role of the elasticity of substitution

Our first exercise varies the elasticities of substitution between capital and labor to ε = 1 ± 0.25.
This range includes both the estimates in Oberfield and Raval (2014) and Karabarbounis and
Neiman (2014) that we described in section 5. Table 8 summarizes the results.
When we depart from ε = 1, the RBC model produces fluctuations in the capital share, but it
cannot match the low but positive cyclicality of the gross capital share. For example, with a low
elasticity ε = 0.75, the RBC model generates a correlation of the gross capital share with output of
−0.95 vs. 0.36 in the data. For a high elasticity ε = 1.25, the same correlation is 0.98. Similarly,
the search and matching model with “no bargaining shocks” can produce sizable fluctuations in
the gross capital share, but it fails to account for the cyclicality of capital shares, either getting the
sign wrong (ε = 0.75) or considerably overstating it (ε = 1.25).
In comparison, our baseline model with ε = 0.75 matches well the net capital share (0.58 vs.
0.57 in the data), but it misses the gross share (−0.02 vs. 0.36). With ε = 1.25, the result flips,
the model can match the gross capital share (0.42 vs. 0.36 in the data), but not the net share
(0.84 vs. 0.57 in the data). In both cases the bargaining shock accounts for between 34 and 38%
of fluctuations. See Table G.8 for the implied autocorrelations.

7.2.2

The role of persistence

If redistribution shocks are short-lived, firms and households face little incentive to adjust their
investment decisions to the realizations of the shock. Thus, when we calibrate shocks to be less
persistent, there is a larger price effect (wages and the capital share become more volatile), but a
smaller quantity effect. Recall that we consider two alternative calibrations. In one, the redistribution shock is a business-cycle shock with a half-life of 3.5 years. In the other, it has a half-life
of 20 years. Both are within the 90% credible set implied by our filtering of U.S. data. We find
that, when we re-calibrate the model, the differences to our baseline calibration are minor. Both
the baseline calibration and the business-cycle calibration explain 34% of the variation in GDP,
compared to 36% with the long-run calibration. The business-cycle shock explains 22% of the
gross capital share, compared with 17% in the baseline and 14% in the long-run calibration. See
Table G.7.

7.2.3

The role of market power

In our baseline model, the profits largely go to physical capital. Market power introduces another
source of profits: markups. Therefore, we augment our model to encompass market power; See
Appendix G.9 for details. If these markups represent pure profits due to inelastic demand in a model
of monopolistic competition, our analysis is essentially unchanged. If these markups compensate for
the fixed cost of operating, we find a more volatile capital share. Re-calibrating the extended model,
we set the elasticity of substitution between varieties to 10, corresponding to an 11% markup. We
find that without fixed costs, the bargaining power shock now explains 20% of the variation in the
capital share and 36% of the variation in output, slightly more than in our baseline. With fixed
costs, the bargaining power shock explains 19% of the variation in the capital share and 44% of the
variation in output.
Given that markups are constant, the RBC model cannot generate fluctuations in the capital
share, unless there are fixed costs. With fixed costs, the RBC model accounts for 15% of the
variation in the capital share, compared to 27% for the corresponding search and matching model
with both shocks and 10% for the search and matching model just with TFP shocks. See Table G.9.
40

7.2.4

The role of exogenous redistribution shocks

In our model, we take the political shifts that drive bargaining power variations as given. However, periods of high unemployment may induce political changes. If this political change led to
redistribution towards capital, this would strengthen our results because it would make wages more
procyclical and, thus, require larger bargaining shocks. Therefore, we concentrate on the opposite
possibility and recalibrate our model assuming that in periods of sustained unemployment, redistribution shocks favoring workers are more likely. Specifically, for every 1 pp. of unemployment
above its mean, the target bargaining power is one standard deviation higher. Formally, the shock
process becomes:


φt
φ̄
nt−1 − n̄
φt−1
ln
= (1 − ρφ ) ln
− ωφ
+ ρφ ln
+ ωφ φ,t .
1 − φt
0.01
1 − φt−1
1 − φ̄
This strong endogenous component changes our results slightly: The contribution to GDP becomes
7 pp. bigger, to 41%, while the contribution to capital share shrinks 5 pp., to 12%. Intuitively,
redistributing toward workers when unemployment is high endogenously makes wages more countercyclical and our calibration finds a smaller standard deviation of bargaining shocks. See Table G.10.
7.2.5

Alternative calibration: Employment cost index

We calibrate our baseline model to the relative cyclicality of the real compensation per hour in
the non-farm business sector for the post-war sample. Alternatively, we can calibrate the model to
the occupation and industry-adjusted wage rate from the employment cost index, deflated by the
PCE deflator. To form the longest possible sample, we splice together the SIC-based measure for
wages and salaries and the NAICS-based measure for total compensation. The resultant sample
covers 1980 to 2014 and we recompute the target moments: First, wages are now moderately
countercyclical with a correlation of -0.25 instead of +0.19. (For the baseline measure, the cyclicality
is -0.02 for the sub-sample.) Second, investment is smoother with a relative volatility of 3.06
instead of 3.28. Third, the average tax rate is lower (20% rather than 30%). Fourth, the share of
depreciation is slightly higher (13.6% rather than 12.7%). Last, the volatility of TFP is 20% lower
over the sub-sample. Hence, we recalibrate the model using the same strategy as before. Intuitively,
we find that bargaining shocks are more important because wages are now more countercyclical.
Bargaining shocks account for 69% of the volatility of GDP and 29% of the volatility of the gross
capital share. See Table G.11 for details.
7.2.6

Alternative calibration: Matching unemployment volatility

Interestingly, our baseline model yields excess volatility of unemployment. The HP-filtered average
quarterly unemployment rate has a standard deviation of 0.83% in the data, but of 1.86% in
our calibration. This excess volatility is in stark contrast to the basic search model with only
productivity shocks, which is well-known for failing to replicate the volatility of unemployment

41

(Shimer, 2005). Cutting the volatility of the bargaining power shock by about 40%, however,
matches the volatility of the unemployment rate. Therefore, bargaining power shocks can be a
simple and empirically relevant way to reconcile search and matching dynamic macro models with
the data. But as Table G.12 shows, in this case, our model explains only 6% of the volatility of
the gross capital share, almost entirely because of bargaining power shocks. Only 8% of output
volatility is due to bargaining shocks, but more than 80% of employment fluctuations are due to
bargaining power shocks. Moreover, this calibration implies wages that are too pro-cyclical.

7.3

Increased volatility

Within countries over time and across countries, we observe large differences in the volatility of
the capital share. For example, the volatility of the HP-filtered gross capital share has fallen from
1.79% per year from 1929 to 1949 to 0.81% per year from 1950 to 2010 in the U.S., a drop to less
than half. The U.K. and France have seen even larger reductions in volatility. At the same time,
the U.K. has a much more volatile capital share than the U.S. post-1950; its HP-filtered capital
share has been about 40% (0.31/0.81) higher than that in the U.S. (Table 1(a)). Controlling for
industry composition, this difference amounts to 60% (Table 1(b)). What would the consequences
be if the U.S. capital share became more volatile due to more political redistribution?
If political redistribution risk increased enough to raise the volatility by 40%, U.S. output would
become 20% more volatile. Consumption volatility would increase as much as output volatility.
Given that households prefer smooth consumption, the increased volatility reduces welfare. In
addition, we find that more volatile bargaining power shocks also lower welfare, mostly by lowering
the ergodic mean of consumption.

We find sizable welfare effects of redistribution risk (Table 9). Welfare, expressed in consumption
units, drops by 0.9% when we increase the volatility of political redistribution risk to make the
capital share 40% more volatile. To compute consumption equivalents, we hold employment fixed
at its ergodic mean. Doubling the volatility of the capital share through increased political risk, thus
undoing the decline we saw in the U.S. post-1950, leads to a welfare loss of 2.1% of consumption.
Eliminating all redistribution risk would increase the welfare of the representative household by
2.7% of consumption.

Quantitative results III: The dynamic effects of a bargaining
power shock

In the previous section, we reported the unconditional properties of the model. In this section,
we document the conditional responses to a bargaining shock. Figure 14 shows the response to
a bargaining shock that strengthens workers’ bargaining power. In particular, we plot generalized impulse-responses based on a third-order perturbation following the procedure outlined in
Andreasen et al. (2017).
First, after this shock, the capital share falls, irrespective of whether we focus on the gross
or the net capital shares.27 Second, output drops persistently: a lower capital share leads to less
investment activity, either in physical capital or in recruiting, and a lower utilization rate. As
recruiting efforts are scaled back, final goods production drops by less than output, but future
employment also falls. Third, the value of the representative firm falls persistently. Fourth, wages
rise more than the marginal product of labor, again reflecting the change in the bargaining power.
Finally, market tightness decreases. Therefore, our model replicates the qualitative features we
found in the data for political events in advanced economies such as France and West Germany,
i.e., a drop in output and firm values and an increase in labor income share.
We analyze next the details of the response of the economy after the shock. The value of the
firm rises initially, if slightly, as firms shift workers from recruiting to production to raise the output
of final goods to take advantage of the existing stocks of workers and capital (this movement also
explains the initial increase in the marginal productivity of capital and of Tobin’s q). However,
as firms reduce their recruiting efforts, employment falls, and with it the marginal product of
labor. This, together with the lower return on capital due to the bargaining shock, leads to lower
investment and a declining stock of physical capital. Both a lower value of the capital stock and a
lower share of the surplus contribute to a fall in firm value.
Interestingly, the reported unconditional impulse-responses mask a pronounced state dependence. In particular, the prevailing capital share at the moment of the shock matters. Figure 15
shows that a given shock to the bargaining power has smaller effects on redistribution and causes
larger drops in GDP and firm values when starting from a situation that already features a low
capital share of income. When the capital share is small, further reductions in its bargaining power
have a higher marginal cost to the firm, but firms do not have space to redistribute much additional
income to workers. In contrast, with a high capital share, the initial drop in the capital share is
twice that of GDP and, after five years, the response of GDP is only twice that of the capital share.
Similarly, drops in employment are more muted when the capital share is already high. In short,
the non-linearities in our model imply that the price and quantity effects of redistribution shocks
depend on how polarized the income distribution is.28
How do our results change if firms would substitute capital for labor more or less elastically?
27

In the short run, we have some non-monotonicities: the bargaining shock distributes what used to be profits to
workers, lowering profits and keeping output initially fixed. The capital share drops. Next output drops, undoing
much of the initial increase in the ratio. Then marginal labor productivity and wages rise further, leading again to a

For the bargaining shock, not much. Figure 16 shows the responses of output, employment, and
the capital shares to a bargaining power shock for the same three elasticities of substitution that
lower capital share.
28
Our model generates relatively large movements in output relative to those in the bargaining power because
the match surplus is small. If the model featured efficient bargaining in the presence of product market rents as in
Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003), capital shares might become more volatile relative to output.

capital share. Its response is more muted when the elasticity of substitution is larger because firms
substitute away from labor when workers’ bargaining power rises.

Figure 16: IRFs to one standard deviation bargaining power shock for various elasticities of substitution.
In contrast, the value of the elasticity of substitution is relevant for the response of the economy
to technology shocks. Figure 17 shows that the gross capital share moves in the same direction as
the productivity shock when ε = 1.25 and in the opposite direction when ε = 0.75. In the CobbDouglas case, the response is almost acyclical. Because in the data the capital share is procyclical
(Rı́os-Rull and Santaeulàlia-Llopis, 2010), productivity shocks have a hard time matching the data
when firms substitute capital for labor inelastically.

Conclusion

Capital shares of income change and can be volatile. For the three countries for which we have long
historical time series, France, the U.K., and the U.S., we observe large declines in the volatility of
the capital share after 1950. This volatility also differs across countries. We argue that political
factors can be an important driver of fluctuations in the functional income distribution.
Several case studies show that political factors plausibly contribute to distribution. Using
international evidence, we show that political events such as transitions in government can be
associated with large changes in capital shares. These changes in capital shares are typically
accompanied by a move in the domestic stock market valuation in the same direction. For most
episodes in OECD countries, output also comoves with the capital share. In the U.S., we find that
capital shares rose after the introduction of right-to-work legislation. Overall, this suggests that
political factors influence the functional income distribution.
We proceed by building a model that features an endogenous capital share. In our model workers
bargain with firms over the match surplus in the labor market, and their bargaining power is subject
to political shocks – which we refer to as political distribution shocks. Filtering the bargaining power
from the data confirms our calibration and narrative. Also, our model matches the standard U.S.
business cycle moments and the cyclicality of the capital share. Political distribution shocks are
powerful in our model: Even though they explain only between 15 and 25% of the volatility of the
gross capital share in the U.S., they can account for 35 to 45% of the volatility of output, depending
on the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. In contrast, a Hansen (1985)-Rogerson
(1988) type RBC model cannot replicate the observed cyclicality of the capital share even with
non-unitary elasticity of substitution or factor share shocks.
We then use our model as a laboratory to ask what would happen if the U.S. capital share
became more volatile due to increased political risk. We find that increasing the volatility of the
capital share in the U.S. by 40%, roughly the relative difference to the U.K., would increase the
volatility of GDP and consumption by about 20%. Reversing the relative decline in volatility
since 1950 by doubling the volatility of the capital share would raise the volatility of output and
consumption by almost 60%. The welfare of the representative household would drop in these cases,
by 0.9% and 2.1% of consumption, respectively. In contrast, eliminating political redistribution risk
in the U.S. would raise welfare by 2.7%.
The dynamic effects of redistribution shocks in our model are strong, but their size depends on
the state of the economy. Our generalized impulse response functions imply that, unconditionally,
in response to a one standard deviation increase in workers’ bargaining power, the gross capital
share at its trough drops by 0.10%, but output drops by 0.5% at its trough. Firm value drops
by 0.35%. The effects are, however, non-linear: conditional on an already high capital share, the
response of output and firm value is much more muted, whereas the capital share responds more
strongly.
