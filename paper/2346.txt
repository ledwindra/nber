Cost—effectiveness Analysis of Strategies to Reduce Infant Mortality

ABSTRACT

This study compares the cost—effectiveness of various health inputs and

government programs in reducing race—specific neonatal mortality or death

in the first twenty—seven days of life. Approximately two—thirds of all
infant deaths occur within this time period. The programs and inputs at
issue are teenage family planning use, the supplemental food program for
women, infants and children (WIC), use of community health centers and
maternal and infant care projects, abortion, prenatal care, and neonatal

intensive care. Using an economic model of the family as the analytical
framework, effectiveness is determined by using ordinary least squares and
two—stage least squares to estimate infant health production functions

across large counties in the U.S. in 1977. Estimates of costs are from a
number of published sources. We find the early initiation of prenatal care
to be the most cost—effective means of reducing the neonatal mortality rate

for black and whites. Moreover, blacks benefit more per dollar of input
use than whites. Neonatal intensive care, although the most effective
means of reducing neonatal mortality rates, is one of the least cost—
effective strategies.

—2I. Introduction

Despite the rapid decline in infant mortality rates between 1964 and
1983**, large cross-sectional differences in infant mortality persist

The

most notable of these is the excess death rate of black babies. The black
infant mortality rate was twice as large as the white rate both in 1964 and
in 1983.

In addition, the U.S. infant mortality rate remains relatively

higher than those of a number of other developed countries even when the
U.S. rate is limited t

whites.1'2

These statistics imply that there is room for improved birth outcomes
in

the U.S., especiall y for blacks, but also for whites. The most recent

evidence, however, sug gests a deceleration i n the downward trend in mor-

tality rates.*** The purpose of this paper is to examine which health policies and programs have the potential to be t he most cost effective in
improving U.S. birth outcomes.

We conside r the benefits in terms of

infants lives saved and costs in terms of the expanded utilization of

various health inputs and government programs. The former include prenatal
care, neonatal intensive care and abortion; the latter include the
following Federally subsidized initiatives: family planning clinics,

corn -

munity health centers, materna 1 infant care projects, and the Special

Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).
The policy evaluations in this paper are based on our recent ly
completed research project on the determinants of race—specific neonatal
mortality rates (deaths of in f

ants

within the first 27 days of 1 ife per

thousand births) across large count ies in

the U.S in 1977.'' These

results are combined with cost data from a variety of sources to compare

—3

the cost effectiveness of alternative intervention strategies.

Our paper is unique because we examine a range of programs in one analytic framework and cover almost the entire U.S. population empirically.
Other excellent cost-effectiveness studies examine only one medical

input.6'7'8 A drawback of such a broad scope is the use of aggregate data
and the potential for ecological fallacy, a form of specification error

arising from omitted variables related to the grouping process. To minimize the potential bias we use only large counties and we examine black and

whites separately. Moreover, we directly test for misspecification in our
aggregate model; when present, we employ a two-stage-least-squares estimation procedure to reduce the bias.

II. Effectiveness

In this section, we describe the basis for our calculations of the

effects of health policies and programs on improved birth outcomes. The
calculations are derived from previous results by the authors.3'4'5 For a
fuller description of the analytic framework, specifications, variables and

results, the reader should refer to those papers. Our analysis is based on
a widely used economic model of the family9'10'3'4'5 which results in the
following equations to be estimated using a multiple regression analysis:

r =

f4(a,c,x,e)

(n,m,a,f,c.s) =

f3(p,y,x,e)

j

= 5... 10

—4The probability that an infants health deteriorates to the point that
he or she does not survive the first month of life is represented by

equation (1). Equations (2) and (3) give the likelihood that a newborn is
of low weight (less than 2500 grams or 5.5 lbs) or preterm, (less than 37

weeks gestation) respectively. The basic set of inputs used in the produc—
tion of infant health are neonatal intensive care (n), prenatal care (m),
abortion (a), organized family planning use (f), BCHS project use (C).

WIC (w), and smoking (s). The other variables are

(r),

a vector of endoge-

nous risk factors such as age, marital status, parity, and spacing between
births; (x), a demographic measure that determines the age of a mother at

the time of birth; and (e), the unobserved health endowment. Equations
(1)—(4) are considered "production functions" because they relate output to
utilization of inputs. Equations (5) -

(10) are input demand functions

because they relate use of a heal th input to price and availability (p),
income const raints (y) and other factors.
The empi rical focus of this paper is restricted to the estimation o f

equation (1)

The coefficients from this estimated equation represent the

direct effec t of an input on ear ly infant survival -—

that

is, the imp act

on neonatal mortal ity holding birthweight constant. However, all the
inputs except for neonatal intensive care may also affect neonatal mor-

tality indirectly through their impact on birthweight. In order to measure
the indirect effec ts of the health inputs, we replace birthweight in

equation (1) by it s determinants. Specifically, we substitute recursively
equation (4) into equation (3), equation (3) into equation (2), and
equation (2) into equation (1) which yields the following:

—5d =
Equation (11 )

allows

f11(n,m,a,f,c,w,s,x,e)

(11)

us to estimate the total effect (both direct and

indirect) of each of the health inputs. The estimation of equations (1)
and (11) is the basis of the estimates of the effectiveness of each of the
health inputs in reduc ing neonatal mortality.
Since the quali ty of the results depends on the quality of the estimation, much care was given to the choice of the unit of observation, the

exact specification of each of the variables and the functional form. Ours
is a cross—sectiona 1 regression analysis of differences in race—specific
neonatal mortality rates among U.S. counties in 1977. Counties are our

Unit of observation since they are the smallest geographic units for which
aggregate national data are available. Regressions are run separately for
blacks and whites.
counties —-

We attenuate random elements by including only large
with at least 50,000 persons in 1970, and for black

regressions, at least 5,000 blacks.

The 677 counties included for whites

and 357 counties for blacks account for about 80 percent of the wh ite and

black populations in the U.S. in 1970.

WIC, and neonatal intensive care. All of these measures are expected to
have negative regression coefficients in the neonatal mortality rate pro-

high-risk age groups are expected to have positive coefficients.

We used teenage family planning use for several reasons. First,
only for teens was this variable available on a race-specific basis.

Second, research indicates that family planning services by teenagers may
have larger impacts on neonatal mortality than use of these services by

older women.5'11 Our smoking variable refers to both sexes because ageand sex-specific aggregate data were not available.

To reflect the fact that government health inputs are designed to be

used by poor women, we defined our variables in a special manner. First,
the denominators of family planning, BCHS Project use and WIC are poor

women, since this is the appropriate pool of potential users. Second,
since the government programs will be more effective the greater the incidence of poverty in a county, we "interacted" each of the three variables
with the percent poor women. For similar reasons, NICIJ use is divided by
low birthweight births and "interacted" with percent of births which are

less than 2500 grams. Fortunately, this does not result in high correlations among the government program variables --

the

highest simple r is

.30 between family planning and BCHS Project use for whites. Also, even
though NICU use is interacted with low birthweight, and low birthweight is
a separate variable, the simple r between the two variables is only .10

for whites and .05 for blacks. It should be noted that in regressions
using other specifications of the variables than those presented, the
ranking of the input effectiveness is stable.

The production functions were estimated by least squares (OLS) and two-

stage least squares (TSLS). We use TSLS to correct for the potential down-

—9

ward biases of OLS.1° In particular, mothers with poor endowed
reproductive capability may attempt to lower the likelihood of an unfa-

vorable birth outcome by utilizing more health inputs. Thus, the use of
the inputs not only affects the outcome, but the anticipated outcome may

also affect utilization. Because of this reverse causality, TSLS is used
to obtain unbiased and consistent estimates.

We test for the significance of the correlation between the error term

and the health inputs, using Wu's statistical test.12 If the null hypothesis of zero correlation is not rejected, then OLS is an appropriate tech-

nique. Since Wu's test is a general test of misspecification, it should
signal the presence of cross-level bias and thus, lessen the risk of ecolo-

gical fallacy.# We originally ran regressions using three different functional
forms:

linear, log-linear and logistic transformation of the dependent

variable. Since results were similar for all three, we present the most easily
interpreted --

the

linear form.

For the first stage of our two-stage estimation procedure, birth
weight, prenatal care, abortion, and neonatal intensive care use are predicted on the basis of female schooling, female poverty levels, the fraction of high-risk women, neonatal intensive care availability, BCHS project

availability, and the Medicaid program. Predicted values of these four
endogenous variables are then entered into the neonatal mortality

equations. The public program input measures are all treated as exogenous
for reasons spelled out in Corman, Joyce, and Grossman.2

Regression results are presented in Table 2. There are two specifications for each race; each specification is estimated by OLS and TSLS. The

specification excludes low birth weight and thus measures the total

effect of an input on neonatal mortality (regressions Al, A2, Bi, 82). The
second specification measures the direct effect (regressions A3, A4, B3,
84).

As indicated by their F-values, seven of the eight equations are sta-

tistically significant at the one percent level. Altogether, the model
works well in predicting variations in neonatal mortality rates based on
medical program usage.$*# The coefficient of determination, however, never

exceeds .20 for both blacks and whites. By estimating race-specific
equations we have removed the most powerful determinant of newborn survival

among counties of the U.S. Put differently, a single equation predicting
neonatal mortality with the percentage black in a county a.s a regressor

would most likely have yielded higher R2's.

In all regressions, the coefficients show the effect on neonatal mor-

tality rates of a one unit increase in the variable. For example, in the
case of whites, equation (Al) indicates that a one percentage point
increase in the percent of births in which prenatal care began in the first
trimester results in a reduction of .045 neonatal deaths per 1,000 live

births. This can easily be converted to express the number of neonatal
deaths averted by having 1,000 additional women begin care in the first

trimester (in this case 4.5). Analogously, the other coefficients can be so
interpreted to yield measures of effectiveness that are used in cost—
effectiveness calculations described in Section III.

III. Cost—Effectiveness Procedure
This section presents estimates of the cost-effectiveness of the

— 12 —

various

programs and inputs discussed above. Effectiveness is measured by

two birth outcomes: the number of additional neonatal deaths averted and
the number of additional low birth weight births averted per 1,000 addi-

tional program and input users. Costs refer to the expense of increasing
utilization of each program and input also by 1,000 users. The latter
figure divided by the former yields the cost of preventing a neonatal death
or low-birth weight birth.

We chose a cost—effectiveness approach as opposed to a cost/benefit
analysis because the estimation and information requirements of the latter

were beyond the scope of our study. For instance, estimating the benefits
of averting a neonatal death or low—birth weight birth are fraught with

problems. The former necessitates that we estimate the value of a life.
Even with low birth weight, estimates of the costs for long-term morbidity
vary a great deal.7

We felt that the advantage of our work lay with its

multivariate comparison of various programs. Since reductions in the
neonatal mortality rate and the percentage of low—birth weight births are
stated policy objectives'4, the relative effectiveness of each program as
it pertains to these clear—cut goals should be very useful.

Tables 3 and 4 present high and low cost-effectiveness estimates for
white and black neonatal deaths and low birth weight births respectively.
The cost—effectiveness figures for each program vary depending on whether

the impact coefficients were estimated by OLS or TSLS. Although we provide
a conceptual as well as statistical justification for the use of TSLS, the
latter estimates have larger standard errors and are more sensitive to

changes in specification than are the OLS estimates. Moreover, to the
extent that the OLS estimates are biased downwards in absolute value,10'4
they may be considered conservative or lower bound estimates of a program's
effectiveness.

The cost figures (Column 3 in each table) are from a variety of sources

which are discussed below. The costs reflect only those expenses associated with utilization of the programs or inputs. The costs of attracting
more women to enroll in WIC, family planning clinics, BCHS projects, etc.

are not included. If a dramatic increase in utilization became a policy

objective, these outreach costs could be substantial. It should also be
noted that all costs are in 1984 dollars. When necessary, the cost estimates obtained from the various sources are inflated by the Medical Component

of the Consumer Price Index to reflect 1984 prices. In the case of WIC,
the Food and Beverage Component of the CPI is used instead.

To estimate the cost of prenatal care, we compute the cost of having
all women initiate care in the first trimester using the procedure in

Joyce, Grossman and Goldman.15 For women in our sample, some initiated
care in the first trimester, some initiated in the second, some initiated

in the third and some received no prenatal care. For those who initiated
prenatal care in the first trimester, the (additional) cost is zero. For
those who initiated in the second and third trimesters, they must obtain an

additional three and six physician visits, respectively. Those who
received no care must obtain 12 visits, the first being a lengthier (and

more expensive) examination. The final estimate is an average of the four
groups, weighted by the fraction of women in each group. Costs of a visit

the payment to the physician, transportation costs plus time costs

of travel and waiting. This gives a total cost in 1984 dollars of $176 and
$187 for whites and blacks, respectively.

The Institute of Medicine7 estimated the cost of initial hospitalization in a Level II or Level III neonatal intensive care unit to be $13,616

in 1984 dollars. This assumed the average length of stay was thirteen
days. Because our measure of effectiveness is neonatal mortality, we did
not include the costs of rehospitalization under the assumption that the
majority of these expenses would be incurred after the first month of life.
Figures for the cost of services provided by organized family planning

clinics are obtained from the Alan Guttmacher Institute. Total state and
federal expenditures for family planning clinics in 1980 ($401,147,000)

were divided by the number of users ii, that year (4,644,000). This yielded

an average cost of $122 per user when adjusted for 1984 prices.16 Fuchs
and Perreault17 estimated the average cost of an abortion as $307 in 1982
dollars. Schramrn8 estimates the cost per WIC mother calculated from

redeemed food vouchers in 1980. A twenty percent administrative overhead
charge is added to the cost of food. He reports an average cost of $122
per recipient in 1980 dollars. Finally, the cost of BCHS project use is
from Goldman and Grossman.18 They estimated the average total medical care
cost per encounter in a community health center to be $28.67 in 1978

dollars. There were 21,285 encounters per center per year with an average

of 7,187 users per center. Hence, the average cost per user was $84.90
[($28.67x21,283)/7,187]. When adjusted to reflect 1984 prices, this figure
became

The number of neonatal deaths averted per 1,000 additional program participants (Table 3, Column 1) is derived from the regression results presented in Table 2.

Except neonatal intensive care, the low estimates are

from the coefficients estimated by OLS in equations Al and Bi, the specifi-

cation excluding low birth weight. The high estimates are based on the
coefficients generated by TSLS except in the case of family planning and

BCHS project use. Contrary to expectations, these latter two inputs had
their greatest impact on neonatal mortality in specifications that included

low birth weight. That is, the direct effect exceeded the total effect.
The number of additional low birth weight births prevented per 1,000
additional users (Table 4, Columns 1 and 2) represents the indirect effect

of a program on neonatal mortality. These estimates are obtained by
subtracting the direct effect of an input on neonatal mortality from its

total effect and dividing by the coefficient for low birth weight. In
other words, separate regressions with the percentage of low—birth weight
births as the dependent variable were not fitted to arrive at these estima-

tes. Results in which a subset of these inputs were regressed on the percentage of low-birth weights and preterm births can be found in Joyce.5

IV. Results

Among the six inputs examined in Table 3, initiation of prenatal care
in the first trimester is the most cost—effective way to prevent white

neonatal deaths. With respect to blacks, prenatal care ranks second to WIC
when the lower—bound estimate is used and first when using less conser-

vative estimates. With few exceptions, WIC is the second most cost—

— 18

effective program, regardless of race, followed by abortion, family
planning, BCHS project use, and neonatal intensive care.

The same pattern of cost-effectiveness exists with respect to low

birth weight (Table 4). Prenatal care is the most cost-effective input for
whites and blacks based on upper bound estimates, but it is eclipsed by WIC

when more conservative estimates are used in the case of blacks. Results
for teenage family planning use and BCHS project use are set to zero since
these programs are found to have an (unexpected) positive indirect effect
on low birth weight.

With but one exception, all the programs are more cost-effective for

blacks than whites. This is an important finding given the racial differences in adverse birth outcomes. It is also worth noting that the
measure of effectiveness employed in this study is rather narrow. The
benefits to women and adolescents from avoiding an unwanted birth or

pregnancy can be substantial, as discussed by Burt.'9 In other words, the
costs of unhealthy babies go well beyond the first month of life.

Although we did not attempt a cost-benefits analysis, the Institute of
Medicine (1985) provides figures for the first—year average cost of a low—

birth weight birth. This cost consists of three components: the expense of
initial hospitalization in Level II or Level III neonatal intensive care
unit; the cost of rehospitalization; and the long-term, single year cost of

long-term morbidity. Using this figure, $14,799, as an estimate of the
benefits of averting a low—birth weight birth, the benefit/cost ratio for
each program with respect to this outcome can be calculated by dividing the
Institute of Medicine's estimate by the cost-effectiveness figures in

— 19 —

Column 3. As can be seen, prenatal care has a benefit/cost ratio well in
excess of one regardless of which estimates are used.

A striking result in Table 3 is the cost—effectiveness of early prena-

tal care relative to neonatal intensive care. This results holds even if
the conservative estimate of prenatal care's cost—effectiveness (Column 4)
is compared to the upper-bound estimate for neonatal intensive care (Column
5).

It should also be noted that -in making this comparison, neonatal

intensive care is three times more effective than prenatal care in averting

neonatal deaths (Columns 1 and 2). The difference in cost—effectiveness,
therefore, resides with the dramatic discrepancy -in cost. If the cost
estimates are accepted as reasonable, then attempts to explain the difference must look more closely at these measures of program use.

For example, neonatal intensive care is a relatively specific measure

of medical intervention. Moreover, it represents but one aspect of
"high—tech" perinatal care. Thus, the inclusion of other measures of highquality perinatal care might lessen the impact of prenatal care relative to
neonatal intensive care if the former is more highly correlated to these

other perinatal inputs than the latter. Put differently, women who receive
early prenatal care are more likely to receive higher quality perinatal
care than those who start prenatal care later in their pregnancies.

Along similar lines, the percentage of women who initiate prenatal
care in the first trimester may proxy a cohort of pregnant women for whom

early prenatal care is but one aspect of healthy behavior. These women may
eat more nutritiously, suffer less stress, and be less likely to smoke, use

alcohol, or take drugs. Except for smoking, we are unable to control for

- 20

-

these other factors. It should also be noted that our measure of smoking
is neither race- nor sex-specific. Hence, if these other behaviors are
more responsible for the association between early care and healthy birth
outcomes, then a program to initiate first-trimester prenatal care among
"high—risk" women may have less impact than reported here.

Finally, this study uses aggregate data and as a result has to rely on
broad measures of program use. There is also a degree of overlap between

some of the programs.9 Moreover, this study is intended to complement the
findings from micro studies with more refined measures of medical interven-

tion. The advantage of our data is that they reflect the outcome of
approximately eighty percent of all the U.S. births between 1976 and 1978.
Further, what should not be overlooked is that our results with respect to
the impact of prenatal care are in general agreement with the findings of
the Institute of Medicine (1985) which summarized hundreds of studies.

In conclusion, therefore, it is highly improbable that neonatal

intensive care is more cost—effective than prenatal care. The magnitude of
the cost difference could not be overcome unless the effectiveness of pre-

natal care were reduced essentially to zero. Even if neonatal intensive
care were interpreted more broadly to include other advances in perinatal
care (e.g., ultra sonography and fetal monitoring), the same could be done
for prenatal care by including WIC and other prenatal interventions.
Moreover, some infant health analysts have argued that the application of
neonatal intensive care may have reached the point of severely diminished

returns.2 Not only will such care become more expensive when utilized in
more marginal cases, but its impact on neonatal mortality should also

— 21 —

decline.

In short, for the U.S. to maintain the rate of decline in neonatal

mortality that it has enjoyed over the past 20 years, more attention will

have to be focused on reducing the incidence of low birth weight. Our
results show that prenatal interventions such as early care and supplemental food programs are relatively cost—effective.

Another result relevant to infant health policy in the U.S. is that
with minor exceptions the programs and health inputs are more cost effec-

tive for blacks than whites. Thus, funds spent on program expansion and
increased input utilization should lessen the difference in adverse birth

outcomes between black and whites. It should be stressed, however, that
our results are based on two closely related assumptions: first, that
increased funding would increase the utilization of these inputs and not
simply their availability; and second, that the costs of expanding utiliza-

tion are similar to existing average costs. Both these assumptions point
to the importance of outreach. Efforts to enhance the number of family
planning clinics, BCHS projects or WIC coupons may yield disappointing
results unless steps are taken to insure that the targeted population makes

use of these resources. Such efforts could alter the second assumption.
That is, contacting high—risk women may require more creative, but more
costly, means of outreach than the estimated costs employed in this study.

Endnotes

**The infant mortality rate declined by 4.3 percent per year between 1964
and 1983, reaching a level of 11.2 deaths per thousand live births in the
latter year.

***Infant mortality fell by only 3.0 percent per year between 1981 and 1983
and by only 2.6 percent per year between 1982 and 1983.

#A major source of bias in ecological studies arises when individuals are

grouped by a risk factor that is excluded from the analysis.13 It is probably safe to assume that poor women from central-city, urban counties are
more likely to experience less favorable birth outcomes than their suburban counterparts due in part to a host of unobservables ranging from stress

and pollution to weaker reproductive capability. We have referred to these
unobserved factors as the women's health endowment. The TSLS procedure is
an attempt to lessen the bias generated by these county-specific characteristics by regressing the utilization of each input on a set of socioeconomic variables and availability measures and using the predicted values in

the structural equations. TSLS may not be necessary in the specifications
that include low birth weight since it is the most important risk factor
associated with neonatal survival.

##According to the Wu test, we do not reject the null hypothesis of zero
correlation between the error term and health inputs for both blacks and

whites when estimating equations (A3) and (83). That is, in equations
holding birth weight constant, OLS is found to be appropriate. For
equations (Al) and (B1), the Wu test results in statistically significant

— 24 -

correlations

[F=2.61 (p.<.05) and F=3.86 (pcOl), respectively] indicating

biased results in the OLS specifications without birth weight.
###Data were not available on the cost per type of service at a BCHS pro-

ject. Consequent1y, this figure is a rather gross estimate of both prenatal and perinatal care. However, this figure is not out of line with the
estimate obtained for prenatal care reported above. Given that many BCHS
project users are from disadvantaged households, initiation of prenatal
care is likely to be later, on average, than the more national estimates

used above. As such, this figure should underestimate the incremental cost
of having all BCHS project users begin prenatal care in the first tri-

mester. At the same time, this variable refers to project use by all women
ages 15-44 as opposed to only pregnant women of the same age. Thus, the
effectiveness of this input may also be understated. In sum, the biases
from underestimating both cost and effectiveness may offset each other to
some degree.
