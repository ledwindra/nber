JEL No. D12,D91
ABSTRACT
In this paper we study consumption network effects. Does the consumption of our peers affect
our own consumption? How large is such effect? What are the economic mechanisms behind it?
We use long panel data on the entire Danish population to construct a measure of consumption
based on administrative tax records on income and assets. We combine tax record data with
matched employer-employee data so that we can construct peer groups based on workplace,
which gives us a much tighter, precise, and credible definition of networks than used in previous
literature. We use the available data to construct peer groups that do not perfectly overlap, and as
such provide valid instruments derived from the network structure of one's peers group. The
longitudinal nature of our data also allow us to estimate fixed effects models, which help us
tackle reflection, self-selection, and common-shocks issues all at once. We estimate nonnegligible and statistically significant endogenous and exogenous peer effects. Estimated effects
are quite relevant for policies as they generate non-negligible multiplier effect. We also
investigate what mechanisms generate such effects, distinguishing between "keeping up with the
Joneses", a status model, and a more traditional risk sharing view.

Introduction
Does the consumption of our peers a¤ect our own consumption? How large is such e¤ect?

What are the economic mechanisms behind it? What are the aggregate implications of consumption network e¤ects? These are the questions that we investigate in this paper.1 To this purpose,
we use administrative data for the entire population of Denmark for the period 1980-1996. The
data set includes information on income and assets, so we can construct a measure of consumption
from budget accounting. The data set also includes information on the individuals employer ID
and other observable worker characteristics, which we use to construct reference groups made of
co-workers sharing similar characteristics (such as occupation or education). Finally, we can match
our administrative data set with a small consumption survey where we observe household expenditures on various goods. This allows us to distinguish between competing hypotheses regarding the
economic interpretation of consumption network e¤ects.
The study of social inuences on consumption behavior has a long history in economics, dating
back at least to Veblen (1899), who wrote that "in any community where goods are held in severalty
it is necessary, in order to ensure his own peace of mind, that an individual should possess as large
a portion of goods as others with whom he is accostumed to class himself; and it is extremely
gratifying to possess something more than others (p. 38)." Veblen also stressed that social e¤ects
on consumption would be stronger for so-called conspicuous consumption: "the competitor with
whom [an individual] wishes to institute a comparison is [...] made to serve as a means to the end.
He consumes vicariously for his host at the same time that he is a witness of that excess of good
things which his host is unable to dispose of singlehanded (p. 65)" (italics added). Duesenberry
(1948) also emphasized the role of social inuences on consumption in his relative income hypothesis:
"The strength of any individuals desire to increase his consumption expenditure is a function of
the ratio of his expenditure to some weighted average of the expenditures of others with whom he
comes into contact".
In recent years, the study of social inuences on individual behavior has grown substantially. In
education, the importance of peer e¤ects on students outcome has spurred a large literature (see
Calvo-Armengol et al. (2009), Carrell et al. (2008, 2009), De Giorgi et al. (2010), Hanushek et al.
(2003), Sacerdote (2001) for recent contributions). There is also a small literature that looks at
the importance of peer e¤ects in welfare use and take-up of social insurance programs (Borjas and
Hilton (1995), Bertrand et al. (2000), Dahl et al. (2014)), as well as one that considers the role
1
We will use the terms "peer e¤ect" and "network e¤ect" interchangeably, although the latter is better used in a
context in which the utility from consuming a certain good is a function of the number of consumers (either because
of congestion or economies of scale).

that peers play in the selection of (and participation in) employer-provided pension plans (Duo
and Saez (2003), Beshears et al. (2011)). Finally, on the labor supply side, papers by Montgomery
(1991), Bandiera et al. (2009), Mas and Moretti (2009), and Grodner and Kniesner (2006) explore
the importance of peer e¤ects in explaining job search, work e¤ort, and workers productivity among
other things.
The study of social inuences on consumption behavior has evolved along two di¤erent lines.
First, the de nition of the relevant reference group. Here, empirical work has been mostly constrained by the type of consumption data available (typically, small consumption surveys with
little or no longitudinal component). Hence peers have been de ned generically as individuals
sharing similar socio-demographic characteristics (as in Maurer and Meier (2008)), or somewhat
more precisely as a racial group within a U.S. state (Charles et al. (2009)), neighbors within a zip
code (Kooreman et al., 2011) or city (Ravina, 2007). Second, the literature has proposed several
economic explanations for the underlying estimated peer e¤ects. There are at least three models
that have enjoyed favor among researchers. The rst is the "keeping up with the Joneses" model,
in which individual utility depends on current average peers consumption.2 The second model
revisits Veblens idea of conspicuous consumption and suggests that the allocation of consumption
among goods may be tilted towards goods that are "conspicuous", such as jewelry, luxury cars,
restaurants, and so forth. The third model is one where risks are shared among members of a
reference group, which creates correlation among their consumptions.3
Our paper advances and contributes to both lines of research. First, we assume that co-workers
are the relevant reference group of individuals and reconstruct the social network of a given household using information about the husbands and the wifes workplace. In the empirical analysis we
de ne as co-worker someone who works in the same plant and is "similar" in terms of occupation
and education. Co-workers represent a naturally occuring peer group. Indeed, co-workers tend to
spend a substantial fraction of their time together. Moreover, friendship often causes co-workership
due to job search strategies adopted by job seekers (Montgomery, 1991).
Our second contribution is to propose and implement empirical tests that allow us to distinguish
between a "keeping up with the Joneses" story, a "conspicuous consumption" explanation, and a
risk sharing view of consumption peer e¤ects.
Why is the study of consumption network e¤ects important? There are at least two reasons.
First, from a welfare point of view one may be interested in measuring and understanding the
2
This model becomes "catching up with the Joneses" when utility depends on lagged average peers consumption,
as in Ljungqvist and Uhlig (2000).
3
A similar intuition is given in De Giorgi and Pellizzari (2014) in the education context.

type of distortions (if any) induced by the presence of peer e¤ects. Depending on the mechanism
underlying peer e¤ects, distortions may be intratemporal (as in the conspicuous consumption case)
and/or intertemporal (as in the "keeping up with the Joneses" case). In the rst case, budget
shares would be distorted, i.e. status-seeking behavior might inate the share of "visible" or
conspicuous goods over the consumption bundle. Since "visible" goods are typically luxuries (cars
or jewelry being the most notable examples), consumption peer e¤ects might have noticeable welfare
consequences (in the form of excess "wasteful" consumption).4 In the intertemporal case, the saving
pro le would be di¤erent from the optimal one we would observe when agents act atomistically.
This may induce undersaving (or over-borrowing) in the attempt to keeping up with the Joneses.5
Finally, if risk sharing is the main reason for correlated consumption pro les we would actually
record important welfare gains.
The second reason why studying consumption network e¤ects is important is because of their
potential aggregate e¤ects. Uninsured idiosyncratic shocks (such as a tax change targeting rich
taxpayers) might have aggregate consequences that go beyond the group directly a¤ected by the
shock. This depends on the size of the estimated e¤ect as well as the degree of connectedness
between groups that are directly a¤ected and una¤ected by the shock. In our empirical analysis, we
nd non-negligible endogenous peer e¤ects, which translate into a non-negligible social multiplier.
We then analyze the e¤ect of policy counterfactuals based on hypothetical consumption stimulus
programs targeting di¤erent groups in the population.
While the economic issues regarding the presence and importance of consumption peer e¤ects
are not trivial (as they may be consistent with di¤erent theoretical mechanisms), the econometric
issues surrounding identi cation of such e¤ects are no less trivial, as is well known at least since
Manski (1993). In particular, identi cation of consumption peer e¤ects in a linear-in-means model
is di¢cult because peers may have similar levels of consumption due to: (a) contextual e¤ects, (b)
endogenous e¤ects, or (c) correlated e¤ects. In our speci c application these three e¤ects could be
described as follows: (a) workers with highly educated peers may have di¤erent wealth accumulation
attitudes than those with mostly low-educated peers; (b) there may be genuine peer inuences, i.e.,
consumption behavior changes (causally) in response to the consumption behavior of co-workers;
4
This is not the case if peers provide "information" about, say, better pricing opportunities, etc.. If the information
story is an important one we should see it emerging mostly among goods with larger informational asymmetries (as
reected in pricing).
5
In a number of recent papers (Rajan (2010); Kumhof and Rancière (2011); Bertrand and Morse (2015)) consumption peer e¤ects play a key role in linking the rise of income inequality with nancial crises. In these contributions,
people in lower quintiles of the wage distribution over-borrow in the attempt to keeping-up-with-the-(richer )-Joneses
(or status-maintaining e¤ects). High levels of debt held by individuals with declining or stagnating wages may then
precipitate a nancial crisis.

nally (c) consumption of all workers within the rm may be a¤ected by some common ( rm-level)
unobserved shock, such as a rm-level productivity change or a health campaign within the rm.
In principle one can tackle (a) using random assignment as in Sacerdote (2001) or De Giorgi et al.
(2010). However, random assignment does not alone solve (b) or (c).
We tackle these econometric issues by extending the network approach idea of Bramoullé et al.
(2009) and De Giorgi et al. (2010) with the use of exogenous shocks to distance-3 nodes. This
requires the existence of intransitive triads, i.e., "friends of friends who are not friends themselves".
However, since this idea is often opaque in its practical implementation, we justify it economically
with the use of rm-level idiosyncratic shocks. To give a simple example, our identi cation strategy
rests on the idea that an event like a rm downsizing experienced by the co-worker of the spouse
of my co-worker (controlling for industry-speci c shocks) has no direct e¤ect on my consumption
but only an indirect one (through peer e¤ects).
In our speci c context, the key fact is that working relationships are individual, but consumption
is shared among spouses. Hence, spouses add nodes to otherwise unconnected networks (i.e., groups
of workers sharing similar characteristics within a rm). It follows that exogenous variation a¤ecting
the consumption of the co-workers of the spouses of husbands and wifes co-workers represent valid
exclusion restrictions.
Our IV strategy delivers an estimate of the elasticity of own consumption with respect to peers
consumption of about 0.3, which is statistically indistiguishable between husbands and wifes.6
Such an estimated e¤ect translates into a non-trivial aggregate e¤ect which depends upon the
degree of connecteness of the households, as we shall discuss later in the paper. When we explore
the theoretical mechanism behind our results, we nd support for a keeping-up-with-the-Joneses
model, while we can rule out sharp versions of models of conspicuous consumption as well as full
and partial risk sharing. These results point towards an intertemporal distortion of the spending
pro le rather than a tilting of consumption towards luxury and conspicuous goods.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we provide information on the data we
have available. In section 3 we consider three di¤erent economic mechanisms that may potentially
generate a relationship between individual consumption and the consumption of peers, and discuss
testing strategies that allow us to distinguish between them. Section 4 is devoted to a discussion of
the identi cation strategy and section 5 to the results. Section 6 discusses the results of a simple
simulation of the aggregate implications of our ndings, while section 7 concludes.

The response to a random peers consumption is much smaller due to large network size.

Data

2.1

Tax records data matched with employee records

We use administrative longitudinal tax records for the Danish population for the 1980-1996 period.
Chetty et al. (2011) provide an informed discussion of the Danish tax system. The dataset includes
information on income and assets for each taxpayer. While income data are typically available in
all tax record datasets, asset data is available because, until 1996, households were subject to a
wealth tax.7 We match these data with the IDA, an employer-employee data set, which includes,
among other things, demographics and rm and plant IDs, from which we can identify co-workers.
We de ne co-workers as individuals who work in the same plant (for public employees, this is the
physical address of their workplace).
Our estimation sample includes households whose head is aged 18-65, where both spouses work
and are employees rather then self-employed. We no longer use these households if one or both
members stop working or become self-employed.8 This selection is driven by the research objective we can only identify the reference network if people are employed; and we can only form instruments
if spouses also work. However, we stress that in the computation of peers consumption we use all
workers, including singles and households with only one spouse working.
Consumption is not directly measured in administrative tax data. We use the dynamic budget
constraint to calculate total consumption. In particular, consumption is calculated as the di¤erence
between after-tax annual income and asset changes:
Cit = Yit
where Yit = (GYit + HSit + CSit

Tit

Ait

(1)

T Hit ), GY is gross income (the sum of income from all sources,

labor and capital), HS the value of housing support, CS the value of child support, T H the implicit
tax on the consumption value of owned housing, T the total tax payments, and A the change in
asset values (de ned as the sum of cash, deposits on bank accounts, stocks and shares, the value
of property, and the value of cars and other types of vehicles minus liabilities). This is similar to
Browning and Leth-Petersen (2003) and Leth-Petersen (2010). Browning and Leth-Petersen (2003)
conclude that this simple measure tends to behave as well as more sophisticated measures which
attempt to account for capital gains, return heterogeneity, etc. (see below for a formal comparison
7

Tax record data are actually available until 2012, but the wealth tax was abolished in 1996. Collection of detailed
asset data was thus discontinued after 1996. Up until 1996 the base for the asset tax (which is our measure of A
below) is obtained as a combination of self-reports (e.g., cars, jewelry, etc.) and third-party reports (e.g., checking
accounts, etc.). After 1996 third-party reports are still available, but the self-reports are not.

Given the applied selection criteria, less than 5 percent of the households ever change spousal composition in our
sample period. Hence, we abstract from divorce and separation in the analysis.

with survey data).
Table 1 provides some descriptive statistics about our sample. All monetary values are in
2000 prices. Annual household consumption is about $49,000, while annual (before-tax) household
income (Yit above) is about $70,000. The value of assets (about $31,000) is smaller than what would
typically be recorded in the US, although we note that there is quite a large dispersion in asset
values (a standard deviaton of just over $100,000). In terms of socio-demographic characteristics,
husbands are slightly older than wives (42.5 vs. 40 years old), and slightly more educated. There
is a large concentration of women in "white collar" jobs, and a larger concentration of males in
"managerial" and "blue-collar" positions relative to females. As for sectoral concentration, there is
a higher proportion of men in manufacturing and construction, and a higher proportion of women
in services and "other sectors" (mostly, public employment). We also compute tenure (years with
current employer within our observational period 1980-1996). We do not nd large di¤erences across
genders (5 years on average). This tells us that co-workers tend to be in the same rm/location for
a non-negligible number of years. Finally, the households in our sample have on average 0.4 young
children (0-6 years of age), and 0.7 older children (7-18 years old).
At the bottom of Table 1 we also report rm level characteristics that we use as controls and
instruments. Average rm size is 260 and 330 for husbands and wives respectively. The annual
growth rate of employment is centered at zero, but there are quite a few rms changing employment
levels, as the standard deviation is about 0.4%. As mentioned a larger fraction of women work
in the public sector (60%) relative to males (32%). Men tend to be more represented in publicly
traded company than women (46 vs. 24 percent). A similar pattern emerges for limited liability
companies with a larger share of men (8 vs. 4 percent), while the pattern is reversed in "other
companies" (mostly located in the public sector), where the fraction of women and men working
are 72% and 46%, respectively. Ultimately, the sample we work with comprises about 760,000
households observed for 17 years (i.e., roughly 13 million observations overall).

2.2

Danish Expenditure Survey

The Danish Expenditure Survey (DES) is, in (relative) size and scope, very similar to the US
Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) or the UK Family Expenditure Survey (FES). See Browning
and Leth-Petersen (2003) for more details about the survey. The survey is available from 1994, but
given that our administrative data end in 1996, we use only the three waves spanning 1994 to 1996.
Figure 1 plots the consumption distribution in the Tax Registry and the corresponding measure
(for the same households) in the survey data (in 100,000 DKr). The two distributions overlap
signi cantly and di¤er appreciably only in the tails (due to issues related to capital gains and losses

6

that are hard to account for in the Tax Registry data). In one of the robustness exercises below,
we investigate the sensitivity of the results to removing the tails of the consumption distribution.
To conduct the tests we describe in the next section, we divide spending in the DES into spending
on visible, neutral, and not-visible goods (with precise de nitions given in the Appendix). While
for most goods the separation is unambiguous (i.e., jewelry or home insurance), we use an index of
visibility proposed by He¤etz (2011) as an anchor. To construct the index, He¤etz (2011) conducts
an original survey where each respondent is asked to rank 31 categories of expenditure according to
their external "visibility". The higher the visibility, the higher the assumed conspicuousness. We
de ne visible goods to include Tobacco and Alcohol, Food away from home, Clothing, Furniture
and Home goods, Electrics/Appliances, Vehicles, Entertainment, Books, Education, Personal care.
Neutral is limited to food at home. Everything else is classi ed as non-visible (insurance, rent,
etc.). In an extension of the testing idea, we construct spending categories that reproduce exactly
the separation proposed by He¤etz (2011), with the exception of charity contributions that are not
observed in the DES.
We use the DES for two main purposes: to validate our main results, and to investigate the
economic mechanisms behind our ndings.

General Theoretical Framework

In this section we explore the theoretical mechanisms that may be responsible for the presence of
consumption network e¤ects. In general, one can think of network e¤ects inducing either shifts in
individual preferences or shifts in individual resources. In this section we discuss the rst type of
e¤ects, and in Section 3.2 we discuss the second type of e¤ects.

3.1

Intratemporal vs. Intertemporal Distortions

The literature has focused on two broad classes of preference shifters: (a) "keeping up with the
Joneses", and (b) "conspicuous consumption". To formally analyze network e¤ects in a traditional
life cycle consumption framework, we assume that the problem of the consumer can be written as:
max

T
X

Ut (pt ; Cit ; zit )

t=0

subject to the intertemporal budget constraint:
Ait+1 = (1 + r) (Ait + Yit

7

Cit )

where Cit =

PK

k k
k=1 pt qit

k with prices pk (k = 1:::K), A is assets, Y

income, and r the interest rate.
We follow Blundell, Browning and Meghir (1994) in considering a general form for the conditional indirect utility function Ut (:):
 2

1
3
; zit + G zit
Ut (pt ; Cit ; zit ) = Ft Vt pt ; Cit ; zit

(2)

k,
In this setting Vt (:) governs the within-period allocation of total spending Cit to goods qit

while Ut determines the intertemporal (or between-periods) allocation (i.e., the choice between
consumption and savings). Ft (:) is a strictly increasing monotonic transformation. Finally, zit =
(z1it ; z2it ; z3it ) is a vector of conditioning goods or characteristics (with z1it ; z2it and z3it possibly
having overlapping terms). We can think of peers consumption C t (or the composition thereof)
as being one such conditioning characteristic. In other contexts, zit includes labor supply or demographics (see, e.g., Blundell, Browning and Meghir (1994)) or "rationed" goods (as in the classic
Pollak (1969)).
In principle, peers consumption C can enter any aspect of the consumption problem. To look
at cases of interest, we start by noting that the demand functions (representing intratemporal or
within-period allocation) are independent of Ft (:) and are hence determined by the usual Roys
identity:

k
qit

@Vt (:)
@pkt
@Vt (:)
@Cit

=

In contrast, the Euler equation (representing intertemporal or between-period allocation) is
given by:
@Ut+1 (:)
= (1 + r)
@Cit+1
or

@Ft+1 @Vt+1
@Vt+1 @Cit+1

= (1 + r)

1 @Ft @Vt
@Vt @Cit .

@Cit

We can now consider three cases of interest.

independent of peer consumption when Cnt enters preferences as weakly separable, as long as one
conditions on within-period spending Cit . This is a powerful testable restriction, similar in spirit
to the one proposed by Browning and Meghir (1991) in a di¤erent context.
In contrast, the marginal utility of total consumption changes with peers consumption, inducing
intertemporal distortions. To see this with a concrete example, consider a simple functional form
(similar to the one proposed by Blundell et al., 1994):

pends on peers consumption (as long as  6= 0). If  > 0, peer consumption increases individual
consumption ("keeping-up-with-the-Joneses), and vice versa if  < 0. Hence, an increase in peer
consumption may change the allocation between consumption and savings (induce under- or oversaving) relative to the case  = 0.

In models with "conspicousness" researchers draw a di¤erence between "visible" and "nonvisible" goods. This induces reshu­ing behavior. Suppose that there are three types of goods, V
("visible"), N ("not visible"), and X ("neutral"). To see reshu­ing with a simple example, assume

that p lim b 1N = 1N B, so a test of reshu­ing can be based on b 1V b 1N , which converges to 1V 1N B 2 . Under
reshu­ing, this product should be negative (as 1V and 1N move in opposite directions and B 2  0).

From the general form Ut (pt ; Ct ; zt ) = Ft Vt pt ; Ct ; zt1 ; zt2 + G zt3 , Table 2 summarizes the

possible cases we can confront. Its easy to show that in the rst case discussed above (additive
separability), both the demand functions and the Euler equation for total spending are independent
of peers consumption. In the intertemporal weak separability case, the demand functions are
independent of peers consumption, but the Euler equation is not. Finally, in the intratemporal
non-separable case, both demand functions and the Euler equation depend on peers consumption.
Our strategy for distinguishing between these various cases is sequential. First, we estimate
Euler equations for individual consumption growth that control for peers consumption growth.
This is meant to provide an estimate of the parameter  in equations (3) or (5). Given that we do
not observe good-speci c prices, we will proxy the indexes at+1 (:) and bt+1 (:) with a full set of year
dummies and region dummies. If we nd no peer e¤ects ( = 0), we can conclude that preferences
are intratemporally additive separable. If we nd that peer e¤ects are present (which as we shall
see is the relevant empirical case), we need to distinguish between the case in which distortions are
only intertemporal (Keeping-up-with-the-Joneses), or the case in which distortions are both interand intra-temporal (Conspicuous consumption).
We can distinguish between these two cases by estimating demand functions and testing whether
peers consumption can be excluded from the demand for the various goods considered (controlling,
crucially, for private total spending). In other words, we can estimate (4) and test whether
and

1j

1j

=0

= 0. Since the most prominent theory for justifying the presence of intratemporal distor-

tions is the "conspicuous consumption" hypothesis, we divide goods according to their degree of
conspicousness (i.e., "visible" vs. "less visible" goods). An additional implication of the conspicuous consumption hypothesis (discussed above) is that we should observe "reshu­ing". If we reject
both the presence of peers consumption and reshu­ing, then we can conclude that distortions are
only intertemporal, as in the "Keeping-up-with-the-Joneses" case.
The estimation strategy assumes that we can obtain consistent estimates of consumption peer
e¤ects. This is notoriously di¢cult due to a host of identi cation problems remarked in the peer
e¤ects literature. We discuss how the structure of networks (at the co-worker level), as well as the
use of exogenous rm level shocks, helps us achieve identi cation in the next section. Once we
have established what the main theoretical mechanism is (if any), we investigate its magnitude,
heterogeneity, and robustness. Finally, we discuss welfare and macroeconomic implications.

3.2

Risk Sharing

A nal theory for why consumptions can be correlated across agents is because of risk sharing
among co-workers. Workers repeated interactions in the workplace may indeed favor risk pooling.

12

In full insurance versions of the theory, the growth rates of consumption of people belonging to the
same risk sharing pool are perfectly correlated (Cochrane (1991)). Hence, full insurance implies
1

= 1 when estimating an equation like (5). Note that in this case there is no meaningful

"causal" relationship running from consumption of peers to individual consumption. The levels
of consumption of individuals sharing risks optimally grow at the same rate because the e¤ect of
idiosyncratic shocks has been neutralized.
However, full insurance is an extreme view of risk sharing, especially in a setting like ours
in which there is substantial social insurance provided by the Danish welfare system. It is more
likely that, if risk sharing among co-workers exists, it provides only partial insurance. One way to
test whether partial risk sharing is at play is to use the di¤erences between consumption in the
DES survey C S (which may reect side payments used to implement risk sharing agreements) and
consumption in the tax record C T (which should not). To see the gist of the argument, suppose
that risk sharing is implemented via side transfers, i.e., workers receive transfer payments in bad
times while the ow is reversed in good times. If worker i has been unlucky ( ln Yit < 0) and
co-worker j has been lucky ( ln Yjt  0), worker j would transfer to i some payments that go
unrecorded in the tax record de nition of consumption. This means that consumption in the tax
records systematically understates true consumption for the unlucky workers and systematically
overestates it for the lucky workers. However, the consumption de nition coming from the consumer
survey (ln C S ) will fully reect transfers because it is based on actual spending on goods (which
is partly nanced by transfers received or paid). It follows that the di¤erence (ln CiS

ln CiT ) will

be systematically negatively correlated with  ln Yit (controlling for  ln Yjt or, in line with our
application, for ln Yt ) if risk sharing considerations are at play. Similarly, (ln CiS

ln CiT ) will be

systematically positively correlated with  ln Yjt (ln Yt in the empirical test) once we control for
individual income growth  ln Yit . Hence, we can run a regression:
ln CitS

ln CitT =  0 +  1  ln Yit +  2 ln Yt +  it

and test whether  1 < 0 and  2 > 0.
Note that the test that  2 > 0 may be more robust than the test that  1 < 0. The reason is

that there may be a spuriously negative correlation between ln CitS ln CitT and  ln Yit . Suppose

that ln CitT includes spending on durables or capital gain and ln CitS does not. When  ln Yit grows,

people may buy more durables, which may induce a negative correlation between ln CitS ln CitT
and  ln Yit that is unrelated to risk sharing considerations.

Identi cation
Identifying consumption network or social interaction e¤ects is not trivial. Two problems in

particular need to be confronted. First, the de nition of the relevant network or reference group.
Second, the endogeneity of the peers consumption variable.
The de nition of networks or reference groups in economics is di¢cult and severely limited by
data availability. Ideally, one would survey individuals, reconstruct the web of interactions they
span (family, friends, co-workers, etc.), and then collect socio-economic information on both ends
of each node. In practice, this is a rarely accomplished task (exceptions are the Add Health data in
the US; and the Indian micro nance clients network of Banerjee et al. (2013)), and identi cation of
networks proceeds instead with identifying characteristics that are common to all network members
(such as race, neighborhood, classroom, cohort, and interactions thereof). In this paper, we assume
that individuals who work together form a social network. There are two reasons why co-workers
may be a more credible reference group than the de nitions adopted in the consumption literature.
First, if social e¤ects increase with the time spent with members of the reference group, "co-workers"
are obvious candidates for the ideal reference group, as they are the individuals people spend most
of their day with. Second, in principle the ideal peer is a "friend". Evidence from sociology and
labor economics shows that nding jobs through friends is one of the most frequent job search
mechanisms utilized by job-seeker workers (Holzer (1988)). Hence, not only do co-workers become
friends; in some cases it is actually friendship that causes co-workership. Nonetheless, our de nition
of network may identify the true network of an individual only imperfectly: some co-workers do
not exert any social inuence, and other non-coworkers may play an important social role. For this
reason, we assume that networks are measured with error. The IV strategy we de ne below is also
designed to correct for this problem, as well as with the measurement error in our consumption
measure, on top of the standard endogeneity problems.
Identi cation of peer e¤ects (or social interactions) is plagued by a number of econometric issues
(Manski (1993), Brock and Durlauf (2001), Mo¢t (2001)) which for the popular linear-in-means
model can be summarized into three categories: (a) contextual e¤ects, (b) endogeneous e¤ects, and
(c) correlated e¤ects. Contextual e¤ects may emerge if co-workers share traits that make them
more likely to select a given rm and these traits are important determinants of the dependent
variable under study. Endogenous e¤ects are the genuine network e¤ects we are interested in.
Finally, correlated e¤ects may emerge if workers share unobserved shocks (say, a cut in their wages
due to a rm productivity shock) that make their consumption move simultaneously independently
of any genuine network e¤ects. In general, when all e¤ects are present it is very hard to distinguish

14

ones behavior as cause or e¤ect of someone elses behavior. In the same vein if similar individuals
or households have common behavior it is very hard to say whether this is because they are very
similar to start with or because they are inuencing each other.
Our identi cation strategy relies on exploiting the social network structure of the households
in our sample. The main idea is that individuals are part of social networks that overlap only
imperfectly (as in Bramoullé et al. (2009); Calvó-Armengol et al. (2009); and De Giorgi et al.
(2010)). In our speci c context, we use the fact that social relationships are established along two
lines: at the family level (e.g., husband and wife) and at the rm level (co-workers). If husband and
wife work in di¤erent rms, it is possible to construct intransitive triads, i.e., "friends of friends
who are not friends themselves". As we shall illustrate in what follows, this allows identi cation of
all parameters of interest of the model.
More formally, we consider the following linear-in-mean speci cation for consumption growth,
which is a simple generalization of the Euler equation (5) above (to allow for multiplexity, i.e., the
fact that husband and wife can have distinct networks):
 ln Cit =

+ 1 ln Citw + 2 ln Cith +

w
1 Xit

+

h
2 Xit

+  1 Xitw +  2 Xith +  it

(8)

Here i and t indicate household and time, while the superscripts w and h indicate wife and
husband, respectively. Hence, ln Citw and ln Cith are the (average) log consumption levels of the wifes
and husbands co-workers; Xitw , Xith are the (average) characteristics of the wifes and husbands
co-workers which can also include rm-level shocks, such as a sudden increase in size or transition
to publicly traded company; Xitw ; Xith are the wifes and husband observable characteristics. There
are a series of good reasons why one might want to consider the two spouses networks separately,
e.g., di¤erential preferences, di¤erential strength of social inuence by gender, as well as di¤erent
bargaining power within the household. We will not make any attempt to micro-found our analysis
as the bulk of our data comes from the administrative tax records, and therefore we only measure
total expenditure at the household level (see 1). Moreover, we lack information on labor supply.11
The main parameters of interest in (8) are the 0 s (endogenous e¤ects) and the s (contextual
e¤ects). The s are, in this analysis, ancillary parameters of interest. Correlated e¤ects may
emerge if  it contains rm- or network-speci c e¤ects. We discuss below how we deal with network
or rm xed e¤ects, if present.
Equation (8) represents our main estimating equation. Note that rst di¤erencing log consump11
We ignore the complications related to non-unitary household consumption behavior, although we acknowledge
that in principle di¤erences between 1 and 2 (or 1 and 2 ) could reect the di¤erent bargaining weights of the
spouses in the intra-family consumption allocations.

15

tion has already eliminated household and individual xed e¤ects for the members of household
i. These xed e¤ects may arise from sorting on rms based on similar unobserved characteristics.
For example, suppose that workers sort into rms on the basis of risk aversion (an unobserved
household characteristic), i.e., more risk averse workers will sort into rms that o¤er more stable
employment patterns or implicit contracts. But since more risk averse workers also consume less
or save more, its not surprising that their consumptions may be correlated even in this absence of
any social inuence. First di¤erencing eliminates this type of correlated e¤ects.
While using consumption data (a household, rather than an individual variable) creates additional complications, it also makes identi cation possible using network structure. This is because
husbands and wives who work in di¤erent rms have their own distinct network of co-workers.
This means that instead of dealing with a series of isolated networks ( rms), we can generate
links (or "edges/bridges") across networks precisely through spouses working at di¤erent rms. In
other words, if our de nition of peer was a co-worker and we were dealing with single households,
identi cation would be impossible to achieve.

Technical Discussion
An Introductory Example: The Simplest Intransitive Triad

To illustrate how we solve the identi cation problem, lets start from a simpli ed version of (8), in
which our sample consists of three single households 1, 2, and 3. The most general model is one in
which the consumption growth of a generic household i (i = 1; 2; 3) depends on her own exogenous
characteristics Xi , and on the exogenous characteristics and the consumption growth of the other
two households, i.e.:

 ln Ci = 

3
X

n=1;n6=i

 ln Cn
+
2

3
X

n=1;n6=i

Xn
+ Xi + "i
2

(9)

As in Manski (1993), this model is not identi ed. To see the type of identi cation strategy we
follow, assume now that the households in our example represent the simplest form of an intransitive
triad, i.e., agent 1s behavior is inuenced by agent 2, who in turn is inuenced by agent 3, who
in turn behaves atomistically. Assume also that agent 3 is subject to an exogenous shock T3 (to
mimic the exogenous rm level shocks we use in the empirical analysis). This produces additional
overidentifying restrictions in a partial population framework as in Mo¢t (2001).12 Hence, we can
rewrite the restricted form of (9) as:
12
All agents can be a¤ected by a " rm-speci c" shock. We assume in this example that only agent 3 is a¤ected by
a rm-level shock T3 to make the argument as sharp as possible.

16

 ln C1 =  ln C2 + X2 + X1 + "1

(10)

 ln C2 =  ln C3 + X3 + X2 + "2

(11)

 ln C3 = X3 + T3 + "3

(12)

The reduced form of this system is:

 ln C1 =  ( + ) X3 + 2 T3 + ( + ) X2 + X1 + v1
 ln C2 = ( + ) X3 + T3 + X2 + v2
 ln C3 = X3 + T3 + v3
The system above is triangular, and therefore it is easy to see that as long as ( + ) 6= 0 and
 6= 0, one can recover all the structural parameters from the reduced form ones. Identi cation
comes from two sources. First, the exogenous shock to agent 3 (T3 ) and the characteristics of agent
3 (X3 ) can be used as an instrument for  ln C2 in household 1s consumption growth equation (in
network language, distance-3 peers exogenous shocks and characteristics are valid instruments).
This is because T3 , or alternatively X3 , a¤ect  ln C2 due to contextual e¤ects in household 2s
consumption growth equation (2 and 3 are directly connected, as is visible from inspection of (11)),
but it has no direct e¤ect on household 1s consumption growth (1 and 3 are not directly connected ),
as visible from (10).
The use of an exogenous source of variation like T3 makes our identi cation approach stronger
than the usual strategy based on the presence of an intransitive triad structure. In practice, it is
similar to using experimental variation in distant nodes that percolate through the entire network
(as long as networks e¤ects are indeed present). To illustrate this idea even more clearly, consider
Figure 2. Couples (A, B, D, E, J) are in circles, while co-workers are in dashed squares. For
example, the husband in couple A and the husband in couple B work in rm f1 ; the wife in couple
J and the husband in couple D work in rm f4 , etc.
Assume that consumption growth is a¤ected by rm-speci c variables Tfj . Previous evidence
(Guiso et al., 2004; Fagereng et al., 2016) shows that rm pass onto wages some of their permanent
value added shocks. For this reason, it is likely that some of the uninsurable shocks that shift
household consumption originate from such rm-related shocks. A speci cation that captures this
idea is (for couple A):
 ln CA =

(XB + XD )
( ln CB +  ln CD )
+ XA + 
+ (Tf1 + Tf2 + "A )
2
2
17

Note that the endogeneity of peers consumption comes from sharing common rm shocks:
 ln CB =
 ln CD =

(XA + XE )
( ln CA +  ln CE )
+ XB + 
+ (Tf1 + Tf3 + "B )
2
2
(XA + XJ )
( ln CA +  ln CJ )
+ XD + 
+ (Tf2 + Tf4 + "D )
2
2

However, this also shows that one can use Tf3 and Tf4 as possible valid instruments. A shock
faced by rm f3 a¤ects the wage of the wife in couple B, and hence the consumption of couple
B. This changes the consumption of couple A through the network e¤ect, but (importantly) not
through the common rm e¤ect shared by A and B ( rm f1 ).
4.1.2

A More General Model

The more general case requires matrix notation but the intuition given in the example above carries
through identically. We generalize Bramoullè et al. (2009)s identi cation argument (which applies
to the individual level case) to our household level case. The multiple network case is also discussed
elsewhere (i.e., Goldsmith-Pinkham and Imbens (2013)).
We allow the spouses coworkers to have separate endogenous and exogenous e¤ects on household
consumption growth. This describes well our data, which are a combination of household level
variables, i.e., income and wealth (and therefore consumption), as well as individual level variables
such as occupation, education, etc.
The model primitives are as follows:
 Household Level Variables: c is the (N  1) vector of household (log) consumption.
 Individual Level Variables:
 X is a (2N  k) matrix of an individuals characteristics. For simplicity of notation, we
focus on the k = 1 case. Just out of convention, we order the husband characteristics
in each couple in the rst N rows, followed by the wives characteristics in each couple
0
in the remaining N rows, i.e. X = Xh Xw . However we note that the X can

contain the rm level exogenous shock.

 Let also Sh (Sw ) be a transformation (2N  N ) matrix that maps households into hus0
0
bands (wives). Given our conventional ordering, Sh = I 0
and Sw = 0 I .
Hence Sh X (respectively, Sw X) will be the vector of husbands (wifes) exogenous char-

acteristics.

18

 Let D be the (2N  2N ) social network at the person level. The generic element of D
is:
dil j m =



1

if il connected to j m (for l; m = fh; wg)

where as before ih and iw denote husband and wife in household i, respectively, and
dil im = 0 for l; m = fh; wg. The number of connections for a generic individual il is
P
P
13
given by nil = m=fh;wg N
j=1 dil j m .

 Call n the (2N  1) vector with generic element nil . The row-normalized adjacency
matrix is: G =diag (n)

1

D with generic element gil j m = nil 1 dil j m .

 Given this notation, S0h G (Sh + Sw ) = Gh is the husband-induced household network,
P
with typical entry given by m=fh;wg gih j m , and identi es the households who are con-

nected to the husbands (wives) of the N households in our sample (symmetrically,
S0w G (Sh + Sw ) = Gw is the wife-induced household network). Hence Gh c (Gw c) is
the vector of husbands (wifes) peers log consumption.

 Similarly Sh GX (Sw GX) is the vector of the husbands (wifes) peers exogenous characteristics.

Given this notation, the matrix equivalent of (8) can be written (omitting the constant terms
for simplicity) as:
c = (1 Gh + 2 Gw ) c + (S0h G
If (I

1

+ S0w G

2

+ S0h  1 + S0w  2 )X + 

(13)

( 1 Gh +  2 Gw )) is invertible, we can use the Neumann series expansion of a matrix

(Meyer (2000), p. 527) to write:

(I

(1 Gh + 2 Gw ))

1

=

1
X

(1 Gh + 2 Gw )k

k=0

= I + (1 Gh + 2 Gw ) + (1 Gh + 2 Gw )2 + :::

(14)

which is satis ed as long as j1 j + j2 j < 1.14
13
of this is weighting the inuence of di¤erent connections di¤erently, i.e., n
eil =
P A generalization
PN
m=fh;wg
j=1 dil j m ! il j m . This is what we do in the empirical analysis.
14
To see this, assume that is a scalar, and A and B are two square matrices. The su¢cient condition for ensuring
1
P
( A)k is that k Ak < 1 (see Meyer, 2000). The condition in the text uses the properties that:
(I
A) 1 =
k=0

k Ak = j j kAk and kA + Bk  kAk + kBk. Moreover, we use the fact that kGh k1 = kGw k1 = 1 because of rownormalization of the adjacency matrix. Hence, the condition k1 Gh + 2 Gw k < 1 is clearly satis ed if j1 j + j2 j < 1.

19

The reduced form of (13) is obtained replacing (14) (for k = 1, which results in a rst-order
"approximate" inverse) into (13):

c  (S0h G

1

+ S0w G

2

+ S0h  1 + S0w  2 )X

+ (1 Gh + 2 Gw ) (S0h G

1

+ S0w G

2

+ S0h  1 + S0w  2 )X + v

The interesting part of the identi cation argument is that one derives identi cation power from
the cross-products between the di¤erent G matrices (in the case considered by Bramoullè et al.
(2009), the population is made of single individuals, hence identi cation comes only from powers of
the adjacency matrix). In the equation above all the parameters of interest are separately identi ed
as long as S0h G, S0w G, S0h , S0w ; Gh S0h G, Gw S0w G, Gh S0h and Gw S0w are linearly independent.
This essentially translates into the exogenous characteristics of peers of distance-3 being valid
instruments.
As mentioned above, the advantage of the Euler equation speci cation (8) is that rst-di¤erencing
removes all xed e¤ects for the members of household i. One may be worried that while rst di¤erencing removes household xed e¤ects, it does not necessarily remove network e¤ects. For example,
all workers in a given plant face a common shock due to poor rm performance. Call fih (t) and
fiw (t) the plant-speci c e¤ects for husband and wife in period t, and assume:
 
w
 it = f (i )t + f ih +  it
t

(15)

Our rm-speci c instruments are designed to capture precisely these kind of shocks. However,
it may still be possible to have unobserved network e¤ects correlated with our instruments. We
consider two approaches. In the rst, we restrict our analysis to a sample of rm stayers. If the
network e¤ect is constant over time (fij (t) = fij (t

1)

for j = fh; wg), rst di¤erencing eliminates the

rm-related e¤ects for those who do not change employer.15 Our second approach uses the whole

sample and adds xed e¤ects for the "transitions" f (iw )t and f ih t .16

Of course, mobility across rms may be endogenous, and for this reason one may need to control for selection
into staying with the same employer. Unfortunately, we do not have powerful exclusion restrictions to perform this
exercise credibly.

what we see in our data. The red symbols are individuals working in a small rm which we call S
(10 employees). The blue symbols next to (some of) the red symbols represent spouses, some of
whom are employed at other rms. For example, 5 and 6 are a family unit, indicated by the cross
marker, person 5 works at S while the spouse works at rm A, where (s)he has 134 co-workers.
Note also that S employs some single workers (persons 15, 17 and 19), as well as individuals with
non-employed spouses (persons 3, 7 and 11).
Who are distance-3 co-workers? Consider again the family unit composed of 5 and 6. In our
speci cation (8), the consumption growth of this family unit depends on the average consumption
growth of person 5s co-workers (i.e., the consumption of 11+12, 7+8, 15, etc.) and on the average
consumption growth of person 6s co-workers (i.e., the consumption of the family units in rm A).
Moreover, it will depend on contextual e¤ects, etc..
In the network jargon, a distance-x peer is an individual who is at least x-nodes away from
the reference node. Since consumption is a household activity, our reference node is going to be a
household rather than an individual. Hence, the distance-1 peers of family 5+6 are the co-workers of
5 in rm S and the co-workers of 6 in rm A. These are the ones who contribute to the construction
of ln C h and ln C w , respectively. Distance-2 peers are the spouses of person 5s co-workers in rm
S, as well as spouses of person 6s co-workers in rm A. Finally, distance-3 peers are individuals
working in rms B, C; and D, as well as the co-workers of the spouses of person 6s co-workers.
The endogeneity problem is solved by using as instruments the rm-level shocks and the average
Xs of the distance-3 peers of the household.
In the empirical analysis we focus on couples where both spouses work. This is not a strong
restriction given the high female participation rate in Denmark (above 80% in our sample period).
However, we do face a series of di¢culties when it comes to data construction. First, we need to
exclude couples that work in the same plant. Second, when we deal with multi-worker rms (which
is the norm), we have to choose whether to construct average peers consumption using simple
or weighted averages, where the weights might depend on occupation and education. Third, a
potential concern is that of assortative mating within the household and the rm. We can think of
this problem as generating unobserved household heterogeneity, which we deal with by di¤erencing
the data as in (8). Finally, we need to avoid "feedback network e¤ects". Suppose that persons 1
and 3 work at rm j and their spouses 2 and 4 work at another rm k (this is not an unlikely
case given the important role of job search networks, see Montgomery (1991), Pistaferri (1999),
Pellizzari (2010)). In our scheme the consumption of 1+2 depends on the consumption of 3+4.
The way we construct the instrument would imply using the exogenous characteristics, or rm level

21

shocks of 1+2 as instrument for the consumption of 3+4, which will violate the exclusion restriction
condition. We make sure to discard those cases when constructing our instruments.

5.2

Network Statistics

Before presenting the estimation results, we provide some descriptive statistics on the network
data. It is useful to recall the structure of the network we create. We start by selecting households
where both husband and wife work ("household network line"). Their distance-1 peers are their coworkers (" rm network line"). Their distance-2 peers are the spouses of their co-workers (distance
1), if they are married and if the spouses work ("household network line" again). Their distance-3
peers are the co-workers of the spouses of their co-workers (" rm network line" again). Note that
when we move along the household network line we are bound to get fewer nodes than when we
move along the rm network line, simply because people can only have one spouse, but they can
have multiple co-workers.
We consider several de nitions of a co-worker. Our baseline de nition takes individuals working in the same plant and weights more those with a similar occupation and level of education.
The weights are constructed as follows. We

rst allocate individuals to

ve education groups

(compulsory schooling, high school degree, vocational training, college degree, Masters degree or
PhD) and three occupation groups (blue collar, white collar, manager). We order education from
the lowest to the highest level (E = e for the e-th education group, e = f1:::5g) and occupation
from the lowest (blue collar) to the highest level (manager) (O = o, o = f1; 2; 3g). Next, we dene a variable called "degree of separations" between any two individuals is and j m as dis j m =

(jEis

Ej m j + jOis

Oj m j) : Hence if is is a blue collar high school dropout (Eis = 2; Ois = 1)

and j a college graduate manager (Ej m = 5; Oj m = 3), dis j m = 5. For individuals with the same
education and occupation, dis j m = 0. We then create a quadratic weight variable
! is j m = (dis j m + 1)

2

(16)

and use it to generate weighted sums and averages. For example, household i wifes average
consumption peers is given by:
0

ln Citw = @

X

j m ;j m 6=iw

1

! iw j m A

1

X

! iw j m ln Cjt

j m ;j m 6=iw

where j m is the member m of family j (m = fh; wg). We adopt a similar weighting procedure for
the creation of the contextual variables.

22

Using a weighted adjacency matrix serves two purposes: (a) some nodes might be more inuential in a¤ecting behavior; (b) they add variation to our right hand side variable. The use
of a similarity index is also consistent with the homophily literature (Currarini et al. (2011)).
Since weight assignment is arbitrary, in the Appendix we present results under alternative weighting procedures: (a) using a linear similarity weight ! is j m = (dis j m + 1)

1

, where dis j m has been

de ned above, and (b) using a much sharper weighting scheme where only co-workers in the same
occupation and educational category are (equally) weighted while all other co-workers are given
zero weight.
Our networks span the entire Danish economy (or, more precisely, the part of the Danish
economy that is observed working in rms). Looking at Table 3, we note that husbands have on
average about 73 distance-1 (weighted) peers (or co-workers), while wives tend to work in larger
rms (or in the public sector), with an average distance-1 peer network size of 95 (weighted) coworkers. When looking at distance 2 peers, the numbers are only slightly larger (average sizes are
90 and 119 for husbands and wives, respectively). Finally, to nd distance-3 peers we again move
along the rm network line and reapply the appropriate weighting scheme. Since wives have on
average 119 co-workers and 95 of them have valid nodes (spouses who work), the expected number
of distance-3 peers is therefore around 11,500. In practice, there are slightly more (around 14,870)
due to a long right tail e¤ect induced by skewness in rm size. In principle, the farther we move
from the center, the larger the network size. In practice, this is bounded by the size of the economy.
In the remaining part of Table 3 we present the average characteristics of co-workers and of
distance 3-peers. As one would expect these characteristics are in line with the characteristics of
the population in Table 1, as there is nothing speci c about being a distance-2 or 3 node.
Identi cation of the parameters of interest relies upon variation in two main blocks: (i) changes
in the composition of the workforce identi ed as distance-3 peers, in terms of their average age,
education, gender and so on; and (ii) economic shocks to distance 3 peers workplace, i.e. growth
in the number of employees, a change in the rm type (such as transition from a private equity
to a publicly traded company), etc.. It is worth pointing out that while individual characteristics
are quite similar in the general population and at the various distance nodes (indicating lack of
signi cant sorting of "di¤erent" people in larger rms), for the way we identify distance 3 nodes,
there is a higher likelihood of observing them in larger rms, potentially including the public sector
(which employs during our sample period almost 50% of our population, as can be seen from the
bottom right part of Table 3). We can also notice that our rm-level IVs identify rms that have
faster growth than the whole population, are more likely to be located in the public sector, and are

23

less likely to be limited liability companies.

5.3

Euler Equation Estimates

The main speci cation we adopt follows from the Euler equation (8):
 ln Cit =

+ 1 ln Citw + 2 ln Cith +

w
1 Xit

+

w
2 Xit

+  1 Xitw +  2 Xith +  it

where C is household real consumption per-adult equivalent and  it takes the form described in
p
(15). We use the LIS equivalence scale, i.e., nit where nit is family size. The set of exogenous
characteristics (X) include: household controls (dummies for region of residence,17 number of
children aged 0 to 6, and number of children aged 7 to 18), individual controls (age, age squared,
years of schooling, dummies for blue collar, white collar, manager, industry dummies,18 a public
sector dummy, rm size, rm-speci c size growth, and rm legal type19 ), separately for husband
and wife. We use the following contextual controls: age, age squared, years of schooling, number of
children aged 0 to 6, number of children aged 7 to 18, share of female peers, share of blue collars,
white collars, managers. All speci cations also include year dummies. We consider two sets of
instruments. The rst set consists of weighted averages of demographic characteristics of distance3 peers: age, age squared, years of schooling, share of women, share of blue collars, share of white
collars, share of managers, kids aged 0-6, kids aged 7-13. The second set of instruments includes
rm-speci c variables of distance-3 peers:

rm size, rm-speci c size growth, rm type dummies,

and a dummy for whether the rm is part of the public sector.
The rst three columns of Table 4 present estimates from three di¤erent speci cations in which
we control separately for the husbands and wifes networks. The other three columns re-estimate
the same speci cations imposing the assumption of a joint household network. Throughout the
analysis standard errors are double clustered, with clusters de ned by plant/occupation/education
for both husband and wife.
In column (1) we present a standard OLS analysis on the rst di¤erenced consumption data.
There are signi cant consumption network e¤ects, which are similar for both husband and wife.
However, these estimates are subject to some of the usual endogeneity (and reection) problems.
In column (2) we thus present IV regression estimates using both demographics and rm-speci c

instruments, while in column (3) we use only rm-level instruments. We also present rst-stage statistics, which are generally much larger than conventionally acceptable thresholds (even discounting
for the unusually large sample sizes).
Our preferred speci cation is the one in column (3), where we only rely on more economically
meaningful rm-level instruments. In the IV case we continue to nd non-negligible consumption
network e¤ects. In column (3), the husbands network e¤ect is 0.37 and statistically signi cant
at the 5% level, while the wifes network e¤ect is slightly smaller, 0.3 and signi cant at the 10%
level. It is important to quantify these e¤ects. A 10% increase in the average consumption of
the wifes (husbands) peers would increase household consumption by 3% (3.7%). However, given
network size, this is a fairly aggregate shock - it is equivalent to a 10% simultaneous increase in
the consumption of all peers (95 and 73 weighted peers, respectively for wife and husband - see
Table 3). A di¤erent (and perhaps more meaningful) way of assessing these e¤ects economically is
to ask by how much household consumption would increase in response to a 10% increase in the
consumption of a random peer in his/her network. We estimate this to be 0.03% in the wifes case
and 0.05% in the case of the husbands.20
In monetary terms and evaluated at the average level of consumption, a 10% increase in the
consumption of a random peer on the husbands side (corresponding to about $5,000) would increase
household consumption by about $25 (and $1,825 in the aggregate). On the wifes side, the e¤ect
would be $15 (and $1,425 in the aggregate). Since individual and aggregate e¤ects may be very
di¤erent, in Section 6 we attempt to quantify the macroeconomic implications of the network e¤ects
we estimate by simulating a number of policy scenarios.
Two things are worth noting. First, in columns (1)-(3), the e¤ects of the husbands and wifes
network on household consumption are economically very similar. In fact, when we test for the
equality of the coe¢cients between husband and wife (H0 : 1 = 2 ) we cannot reject the null
hypothesis of equality (with large p-values) in the more relevant IV models. Given this evidence,
in the rest of Table 4 we re-estimate all models imposing that husband and wife belong to a single
joint network (columns (4)-(6)). The second aspect of the analysis that is worth highlighting is
that OLS estimates are smaller than IV estimates. This is surprising given that a pure endogeneity
bias would bias OLS estimates upwards. However, measurement error in peers consumption may
induce a bias that goes in the opposite direction, and it may be larger (in absolute value) than the
endogeneity bias. Recall that our OLS speci cation has already eliminated a lot of the bias coming
20
This calculation is obtained by multiplying the estimated network e¤ect by the probability of a member of the
0:3

network experiencing the consumption increase (i.e., for the wife the e¤ect is computed as 0:0032 = 95:1

from observed and unobservable heterogeneity by rst di¤erencing and by the inclusion of a large
set of socio-demographic controls. Hence, OLS estimates are more likely to reect the downward
bias of measurement error than the endogeneity upward bias.21 Moreover, any measurement error
in levels is exacerbated by rst di¤erencing the data (Hausman and Griliches (1986)). Further,
it is possible that OLS is downward bias due to the exclusion bias highlighted by Caeyers and
Fafchamps (2015).
Imposing a joint household network (as in columns (4)-(6)) results in expectedly precise IV
estimates. The joint network e¤ect is estimated to be around 0.33 and is statistically signi cant
at the 1% level. The rst-stage F-statistic in our preferred speci cation (column (6)) is 112, which
shows that our instruments have strong identifying power. The economic interpretation of the joint
network e¤ect is similar to the one presented above. A random peers 10% increase in consumption
would increase household consumption by 0.04%.
5.3.1

Heterogeneity of network e¤ects

Are network e¤ects heterogeneous? For example, one may believe that e¤ects vary with network
size: peer e¤ects may be much more important in a small rm than in a large rm where personal
and social contacts can be more diluted. Moreover, peer e¤ects may depend on observables such as
(weighted) network size, education, share of women, the business cycle, etc.. The e¤ect of tenure is
particularly important, as one may test whether social pressure increases with the time spent with
a co-worker (e¤ects may be small at low levels of tenure and larger at high levels of tenure).
In lieu of presenting a Table with regression estimates, Figure 4 shows how the consumption
network e¤ect varies with observable characteristics (network size, age, years of schooling, share of
women peers, a measure of the business cycle, and tenure). These e¤ects come from IV regressions
similar to those in column (6) of Table 4, but with the inclusion of an interaction of the peers
average log consumption with the relevant source of heterogeneity. The graph also plots the upper
and lower bounds of a 95% con dence interval. All demographic characteristics refer to the husband
(due to his primary earner role).
The rst interesting result is that consumption peer e¤ects do not vary signi cantly with the
network size. The e¤ect increases slightly with age, but the e¤ect is very noisy at older ages.
Consumption network e¤ects seems also stronger for the low educated and in male-dominated
professions. Interestingly, network e¤ects are larger when the economy is booming and smaller
during recessions - but estimates are signi cant only for a growth rate above 2% or so. Finally,
21

As an informal check, we re-estimated the OLS model without controlling for covariates and nd much larger
estimates of b
1 = 0:5 and b
2 = 0:45.

26

we look at the e¤ect of tenure. Unfortunately, our measure of tenure is limited and subject to
left-censoring. We hence use a simple dummy for new employee. As expected network e¤ects
are present among those who have been in the rm for at least some time, but are statistically
and economically absent for newly hired employee, perhaps because these individuals have yet to
"learn" about co-workers consumption choices and habits.
5.3.2

Other Concerns

Table 5 contains the results of a number of speci cations designed to address a variety of concerns.
Column (1) reproduces, for comparison, the results of our preferred speci cation (Table 4, column
6). The rst concern is the possibility that the error term may still contain network (correlated)
e¤ects which may generate spurious evidence of endogenous e¤ects. To address this issue, we follow
two strategies. In column (2) we focus on a sample of rm stayers, for whom rm xed e¤ects are
di¤erenced out so that they are no longer a concern. In column (3) we use the whole sample but
include xed e¤ects for all possible cross- rm transitions (and assume stationarity).22 Reassuringly,
looking at stayers or including transition xed e¤ects leaves the results very similar to the baseline.
Our measure of consumption, based on a budget accounting, may miss capital gains and capital
losses, i.e., it may fail to be accurate at the top and bottom of the consumption distribution. In
column (4) of Table 5 we present results obtained using a measure of consumption that drops the
top and bottom 1% of the consumption distribution. The estimate is essentially unchanged both
in magnitude and statistical precision.
In column (5) to (7) we use di¤erent weighting schemes for co-workers (and report the main
features of the networks in Tables A2-A4). Recall that our baseline uses the quadratic weighting
scheme (16), which gives more weight to peers with similar education and occupation within the
plant. In column (5) we experiment with a linear scheme, while in column (6) we consider a richer
quadratic weighting scheme based on education and occupation (as before) but also age (to capture
tenure e¤ects). To keep the number of groups within the feasible range, we consider just two age
ranges, 40 and less, and more than 40. Finally, in column (7) we use a sharper weighting scheme
in which all workers in the same plant and occupation are treated equally (regardless of their
education). The estimates of the endogenous e¤ects vary in size across adopted schemes. However,
once these estimates are appropriately rescaled for the larger or smaller peer group, the elasticities
we obtain are in the same ballpark as those in column (1), and discussed above. For example, a
22

In other words, we include dummies for each possible transition between any two rms in our data. While we
do not impose the restriction that transitions from rm A to B are the same as transitions from B to A, we have to
impose that the transition e¤ects are constant over time (stationarity).

27

10% increase in the consumption of a random peer produces a 0.05% e¤ect for the linear scheme
in column (5), a 0.053% for the scheme of column (6), and nally a 0.036% e¤ect for the same
occupation scheme in column (7) (as opposed to 0.04% in the baseline speci cation).
Bias from correlated e¤ects may come from co-workers su¤ering similar aggregate shocks.
Columns 8 and 9 are designed to further address these concerns. In column (8) we control for
neighborhood speci c shocks (measured by changes in local unemployment rates), while in column
(9) we control for sector speci c shocks (measured by a full set of sector-year dummies). The results
remain unchanged.
Finally, can our results still be spurious? There could be some unobserved factors running
through the economy which might produce correlation in consumption that have nothing to do
with network e¤ects. To assuage these fears, we construct placebo samples where we randomly
reassign workers to rms, keeping rm sizes constant. The results, based on 50 replications, are
reported in the last column of Table 5. They show that the main estimated e¤ects are not spurious.
When individuals are randomly allocated peers, their consumption is independent of that of their
randomly allocated peers, with an estimated small network e¤ect of 0.01 and a large standard error.
Overall, we take the series of results presented in Table 5 as quite reassuring. The estimated
e¤ects appear robust to several potential sources of bias and change in predictable ways when
we change the way we weight co-workers within a plant. The robustness of results is perhaps
not surprising, given that our identi cation strategy uses admittedly exogenous rm shocks, the
network structure of households in our sample (which can only be nely reconstructed with the
type of data we have available), and a rich set of controls, including household xed e¤ects and
controls for local shocks.

5.4

Demand Estimation

The results presented in the previous section point to the presence of considerable intertemporal
distortions on consumer behavior. Table 2 suggests that intertemporal distortions may also be
compatible with the presence of intratemporal distortions, which may have very di¤erent policy
implications, as well as suggesting di¤erent theoretical mechanisms.
In this section we follow the structure developed in Section 3.1 and estimate demand equations
for "visible" and "non-visible" goods. In particular, we run the following regressions:
! jit = Xit0

0j

+

1j ln C t

+

0j

ln Cit +

1j


ln Cit  ln C t +  jit

(17)

for j = fV; N g. Neutral goods (which we assume include only food at home) represent the excluded

28

category. The detailed categorization of what we include in the three types of goods is presented
in Table A1. As discussed in Section 3, we test whether the average consumption peer variables
are insigni cant determinants of the demand for goods (i.e.,

1j

=

1j

= 0 for all j = fV; N g),

controlling for total spending ln Cit . We also report the results of a simpler speci cation in which
we omit the interaction (and hence assume

1j

= 0 for all j). This is useful because it allows us to

perform a simple test of reshu­ing, i.e., testing that

1V

1N

< 0.

We report results for two samples. The rst sample is all households that can be matched
with the tax registry (independently of marital and work status), comprised of 2,438 households
(the "ALL" sample). For these households we do not have distance-3 instruments (as this depends
on both the work and marital status) and hence we run simple OLS regressions. Our second
sample is a perfect match with our tax registry baseline sample, and is hence much smaller given
the restrictions we apply for estimation (454 households, or the "MATCH" sample). For these
households we can run IV regressions instrumenting peer consumption with distance-3 instruments
as in the Euler equation case discussed above.
The results are reported in Table 6. In columns (1)-(2) we report estimates of (17) for the "ALL"
sample. There is no evidence that conspicuous consumption changes intratemporal allocations.
Controlling for total consumption, the marginal e¤ect of peers consumption,

@! jt
;
@ln C t

is small and

statistically insigni cant for both visible and non-visible goods. To avoid collinearity problems,
in columns (3)-(4) we impose

1j

= 0. We now estimate signi cant main e¤ects for total log

consumption (suggesting that visible goods are luxuries and non-visible goods are necessities),
but again nd no statistically signi cant e¤ects of peers consumption. At face value, there is no
evidence of reshu­ing (the sign of the estimated coe¢cients,

1j ,

is positive in both equations).

Note that the results do not depend on the richness of controls used, and are con rmed even when
we have no controls in the regression besides total consumption, peers consumption, and their
interaction. Finally, the results do not depend on assuming that peers consumption is exogenous.
In columns (5)-(6) we replicate the estimation on the "MATCH" sample, where we can instrument
peer consumption with distance-3 exogenous rm-level shocks and characteristics. The results are
qualitatively unchanged (but expectedly less precise in this smaller sample).
There is some inherent arbitrariness in how we classify goods into visible, neutral, and nonvisible categories. To counter this criticism, we disaggregate spending into all the 30 categories
considered by He¤etz (2011), and run the budget share regression (17) separately for each good
category (imposing again

1j

= 0 for all j). Figure 5 plots the estimated coe¢cients (and corre-

29

sponding 90% con dence intervals) against the degree of visibility as estimated in He¤etz (2011).23
We also plot a local linear regression line to detect any possible relationship between the visibility
index and the estimated coe¢cients. We do this for the two samples described above (so that

1j

is

estimated by OLS in the rst sample and by IV in the second sample). In principle, the regression
coe¢cient should rise with the degree of visibility if there were any intratemporal e¤ects. However,
the disaggregated evidence is similar to the one noted above. The e¤ect of peer consumption on
the budget share on good j appears independent of the degree of conspicousness of the good. The
relationship is increasing only for highly conpiscuous goods in the OLS case, but the estimates are
very noisy. In the baseline sample where we control for the endogeneity of peer consumption the
e¤ect goes in the opposite direction of what models with conspicuous consumption would suggest.

5.5

Risk Sharing

As discussed in Section 3.2, another reason for observing a correlation between individual and peer
consumption is because of risk sharing within the rm. The theory of risk sharing states that when
risks are shared optimally, consumption growth of two individuals who are part of a risk sharing
agreement will move in locksteps even if the two individuals do not interact socially. The extreme
case is where co-workers only observe income but do not observe consumption (i.e., all relevant
consumption is domestic). However, this is enough to generate risk sharing as long as we believe
problems of private information or limited enforcement are more easily solved within the strict
con nes of the workplace.
Results reported in Table 4 already reject the strongest form of full insurance (i.e., that individual consumption should move at the same rate as aggregate peer consumption). The way we
test for partial risk sharing is explained in Section 3.2. We consider the regressions:
ln CitS

ln CitT = Xit0  0 +  1  ln Yit +  2 ln Yt +  it

and test whether  1 < 0 and  2 > 0.
The results are reported in Table 7. As in Table 6, we focus on the "ALL" sample (column 1)
and the "MATCH" sample. However, we perform in both cases simple OLS regressions as we are
only interested in the sign of the relationship between the coe¢cient on income growth and the consumption di¤erences between survey and tax registry data. Risk sharing would suggest a negative
23

The consumption categories used by He¤etz (ordered according to his visibility index, high to low) are: Cigarettes,
cars, clothing, furniture, jewelry, recreation type 1, food out, alcohol home, barbers etc., alcohol out, recreation type
2, books etc. education, food home, rent/home, cell phone, air travel, hotels etc. public transportation, car repair,
gasoline, health care, charities, laundry, home utilities, home phone, legal fees, car insurance, home insurance, life
insurance, underwear. We use the same categories except charities for which we have no survey information.

30

association between earnings growth and the survey-tax record consumption log-di¤erential. This
is because individuals who su¤er a negative income loss should receive a transfer from peers, which
would increase the survey-based measure of consumption (which includes the "shared" transfer)
relative to the tax records measure (which does not). In the data (irrespective of sample used)
there is actually a positive, and statistically signi cant association. Similarly, there is no evidence
of a positive association between average earnings growth of peers and the survey-tax record consumption log di¤erential. We conclude that it is unlikely that our results of signi cant peer e¤ects
are spuriously coming from risk sharing within the rm.

Implications

6.1

Aggregate E¤ects
The e¤ects of macroeconomic stabilization policies may depend on the presence of peer e¤ects.

Small stabilization policies may have larger or smaller e¤ects than in a world where peer e¤ects are
absent because of social multiplier e¤ects. Here we discuss a simple macro experiment based on
our empirical estimates. In this experiment we neglect General Equilibrium e¤ects on asset prices,
labor supply, and so forth, to highlight the role of network e¤ects in the sharpest possible way.
We start from the consideration that a tax/transfer imposed on a group may reverberate through
the entire distribution, depending on the degree of connectedness of individuals. A "benchmark"
multiplier, which abstracts from the degree of connectedness, is about 1.5 (from the regression of
Table 4 column 6, obtained as 1=(1 b
) with b
 
= 0:33), so aggregate e¤ects may potentially be
important. We should note that the speci c multiplier is only valid in a world where the network
is full, i.e., all the nodes are directly connected, which is clearly not the case in a standard setting
and in our speci c application. We therefore have to account for the degree of connectedness as
well as for the introductory point of the policy (i.e., which group is directly targeted) in order
to understand the aggregate implications of network e¤ects. To do so, we engineer a series of
experiments, summarized in Table 8. We present not only the multiplier e¤ects of a one-time policy
(in a static framework), but also several moments of the resulting distribution of consumption. We
do this in order to understand the level and distributional e¤ects of such policy experiments. Note
that in the rst row of Table 8 we present the actual moments from the 1996 sample (our last
sample year).
Our rst three experiments consist of transferring the equivalent of 1% of aggregate consumption
equally among: (a) households in the top 10% of the consumption distribution, (b) a 10% random
sample of households, and (c) households in the bottom 10% of the consumption distribution. These

31

three policies are nanced by issuing debt and running a government de cit. As an alternative to
a debt- nanced policy, we consider: (d) a purely redistributive policy in which the receivers of
the transfers are households in the bottom 10%, and the policy is

nanced by a "tax" to the

top 10% of households. Note that we abstract from the possibility that MPCs are heterogeneous.
Alternatively, the government transfer is a consumption coupon, so it is entirely consumed (and
MPC heterogeneity plays no role).24
Consider the

rst experiment, which consists of distributing resources to households in the

top 10% of the consumption distribution. In a world without network e¤ects, this would increase
aggregate consumption by 1%, with an implied multiplier of 1.01. With network e¤ects, the implied
multiplier e¤ect is instead slightly larger, 1.012.25 There is also a slight increase in the dispersion
of consumption, as measured by the standard deviation of log consumption or the 90-10 percentile
di¤erence in log consumption. The reverberation e¤ects are concentrated in the top half of the
consumption distribution (as can be seen by looking at the 90/50 and 50/10 log consumption
di¤erences). What can be learned from this experiment is that consumption policies targeted
at the top 10% of the consumption distribution (presumably also the wealthier households), have
limited aggregate e¤ects, and in particular do not spread along the distribution of consumption. The
reason is that households at the top of the consumption distribution have fewer direct connections
and their network structures are smaller and more sparse then those of random households in the
population.
The next experiment (where we target a random 10% of households) con rms this intuition. In
this case the multiplier is 1.017 and consumption inequality declines. A look at the 90-50 and 50-10
di¤erences reveals that policies that target a random sample of households (most likely located in
the middle of the distribution) have larger, and more far reaching consequences than policies of
identical magnitude targeted at the top 10%. This is because those households have larger and
denser networks than those at the top.
Even larger aggregate e¤ects are found when the policy targets the bottom 10% of households.
In this case the multiplier e¤ect is noticeably larger than in the previous cases (1.034), with a much
larger fall in dispersion (a 13% decline in the standard deviation of log consumption). These results
suggest that households at the bottom of the distribution have larger and denser networks, which
24

See Jappelli and Pistaferri (2014) about the importance of MPC heterogeneity.
The multiplier is obtained as the ratio of the post-transfer to the pre-transfer aggregate consumption. We
obtain post-transfer aggregate consumption using a simple iterative algorithm. After increasing the consumption of
households targeted by the policy by the amount of the transfer, we compute peer consumption using the weighted
formula explained in the text. We then compute the new level of consumption of all households in the sample using
the network e¤ect estimate. We recompute peer consumption, and so forth. We stop after 10 iterations.
25

32

tend to be concentrated among households with similarly low consumption levels. Indeed, a look
at the 50/10 and 90/50 percentile di¤erences show that the latter barely moves (relatively to the
baseline), while the former declines substantially.
In the nal row of Table 8 we consider a balanced budget experiments in which a transfer to
poorer households is nanced by a tax imposed on the richer households (who hence mechanically
reduce their consumption). This case yields an intermediate multiplier e¤ect (1.021), with the
largest reduction in dispersion among all experiments. This is because there are now richer e¤ects:
households connected with those at the top (presumably near the top themselves) reduce their
consumption, while households connected with those at the bottom (presumably also located in
the bottom half) increase it. The result is that the post-policy consumption distribution becomes
more compressed, and the larger degree of connectedness at the bottom than at the top drives
aggregate consumption upwards.
In conclusion, what we learn from the experiments detailed in Table 8 is that stimulus policies
can have quite di¤erential impacts on aggregate consumption and on the distribution of household
consumption depending on the groups that are directly targeted (and their overall connectedness
with the di¤erent segments of the population). Another important, and obviously related lesson is
that the multiplier e¤ect generally computed as (1
of fairly general network

can be highly misleading in the presence

structures.26

Conclusions

This paper builds a consistent theoretical framework for consumption choices within and between
periods that is able to capture social e¤ects and allows us to distinguish between di¤erent ways in
which social interactions can emerge. We take the testable empirical predictions that come from
the model and bring them to bear on a very rich set of data containing (derived) information
on the consumption of the entire Danish population and the social networks they span (at the
household and rm level). We nd that peers consumption enters the intertemporal decision, i.e.
in a "Keeping-up-with-the-Joneses" fashion. We do not nd evidence that network e¤ects distort
intratemporal decision (i.e., the demand for goods). As well, we

nd little evidence that peer

e¤ects emerge as a way of rationalizing risk sharing agreements. We have discussed the policy
consequences of these results using simple stimulus policy experiments that transfer consumption
resources to di¤erent groups in the population. The results highlight two important conclusions:
the e¤ects of the policies depend on the degree of connectedness of the group directly targeted, and
26

A related point based on social distance is given in Glaeser, Scheinkman, and Sacerdote (2003).

social multipliers (typically computed as (1

)

1,

where  is the estimated network e¤ect) can be

highly misleading when network structures are far from full.
Our results could be extended in a number of directions. While we have emphasized the
importance of peers de ned on the basis of co-worker relationships, it could be possible to construct
family networks or location networks. Family identi ers, for example, could allow us to match
parents and children, or siblings. The problem with this approach is that a non-negligible number
of households may be completely disconnected (i.e., older households or only children). On the
location side, we observe the municipality where the household resides. Here, we may face the
opposite problems (i.e., the network may be too large and composed of people who do not interact
socially in any meaningful way). On the theoretical side, it could be possible to test whether peers
provide primarily "information", i.e., whether peer e¤ects manifest themselves among goods that
are "experience goods". Unfortunately, our microdata on spending are too limited to implement
such exercise.
