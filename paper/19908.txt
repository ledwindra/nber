Union Organizing Decisions in a Deteriorating Environment: The Composition of Representation
Elections and the Decline in Turnout
Henry S. Farber
NBER Working Paper No. 19908
February 2014
JEL No. J5,J50
ABSTRACT
It is well known that the organizing environment for labor unions in the U.S. has deteriorated dramatically
over a long period of time, contributing to the sharp decline in the private sector union membership
rate and resulting in many fewer representation elections being held. What is less well known is that,
since the late 1990s, average turnout in the representation elections that are held has dropped substantially.
These facts are related. I develop a model of union decision making regarding selection of targets for
organizing through the NLRB election process with the clear implication that a deteriorating organizing
environment will lead to systematic change in the composition of elections held. The model implies
that a deteriorating environment will lead unions not only to contest fewer elections but also to focus
on larger potential bargaining units and on elections where they have a larger probability of winning.
A standard rational-voter model implies that these changes in composition will lead to lower turnout.
I investigate the implications of these models empirically using data on turnout in over 140,000 NLRB
certification elections held between 1973 and 2009. The results are consistent with the model and suggest
that changes in composition account for about one-fifth of the decline in turnout between 1999 and
2009.

Introduction and Background

It is well known that the union membership rate in the U.S. private sector has been falling for
almost 40 years, from about 25 percent in the early 1970s to less than 7 percent in 2012 and
2013.1 It is also well known that union organizing activity in the private sector, measured by
the number of National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) supervised representation elections,
has been declining over the same period, from over 7,000 elections per year in the early 1970s
to between 1,500 and 2,000 elections per year in the 2005-2009 period.2 These facts reflect a
long run deterioration in the economic and organizing environment faced by unions in this
country.
What is less well known is that turnout in these elections, while historically very high
(almost 90 percent, on average) has dropped substantially since the late 1990s.3 In this
study, I develop a model of union decision making regarding selection of targets for organizing through the NLRB election process with the clear implication that a deteriorating
organizing environment will lead not only to fewer elections (less organizing activity) but
also to systematic changes in the composition of elections held. The model implies that a
deteriorating environment will lead unions to attempt to organize larger potential bargaining units and where they have a larger probability of winning an election. I then use a
standard rational-voter model to demonstrate that these changes in composition will lead to
lower turnout in the elections that are held. Finally, I present statistical evidence consistent
with these models using data on turnout in over 140,000 NLRB certification elections closed
between 1973 and 2009.
In the remainder of this section, I present some background on union representation
elections, including statistics on the number of elections, union win rates, and turnout over
time. I then present, in section 2, a simple economic model of an individual’s vote/no-vote
decision. In section 3, I present the model of union decision making regarding selection of
organizing targets, and I derive the empirical implications of this model. In section 4, I
present a statistical model of turnout rates that accounts for unobserved heterogeneity in
vote probabilities across elections. Section 5 contains the results of my analysis of the decline
in turnout, and section 6 concludes.

This is in sharp contrast to turnout in national political elections, where turnout is much lower but
there is no evidence of a decline. Tabulation of self-reported voting behavior from the November voting
supplements to the CPS shows that the probability of a citizen voting in presidential elections averaged
65 percent prior to 2000 and 71 percent subsequently. The comparable figures for off-year elections are 51
percent before 2000 and 53 percent subsequently.

1.1

Background on Union Representation Elections

The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), passed in 1935, codified in law the right of
workers in the private sector to be represented by a union of their choice.4 This law specified
a secret ballot election mechanism that allows workers to express their preferences for union
representation. In broad strokes, the NLRA allows a group of workers or a union (or potential
union) acting on their behalf to petition the NLRB to hold an election with a “showing of
interest” by workers in the potential bargaining unit. An employer can also request an
election if a question arises about workers’ preferences for union representation. After issues
involving the definition of the appropriate group of workers involved are resolved, the NLRB
holds an election.5 If the union receives more than 50 percent of the votes cast in the election,
then the NLRB certifies that the union is the exclusive representative of the workers for the
purposes of collective bargaining. This certification is valid for one year. If the union and
employer reach agreement on a contract within that period, then the union continues as the
bargaining agent of the workers. If the union and employer do not reach agreement within
that period, then the union is no longer recognized as the bargaining agent of the workers.6

1.2

High-Level Facts

In order to set the stage for the theoretical and empirical analyses, I present some aggregate
facts regarding the level of election activity over time, union success in elections, and voter
turnout.
I have data on 237,022 individual elections involving a single union “closed” by the NLRB
4

Additional legislation that served to modify the NLRA includes 1) the Labor-Management Relations
(Taft-Hartley) Act, passed in 1947 over President Truman’s veto and 2) the Labor-Management Reporting
and Disclosure (Landrum-Griffin) Act, passed in 1959.
5

There are many rules governing employer and union behavior during organizing campaigns, and either
side may file “unfair labor practice” charges against the other side with the NLRB. The NLRB adjudicates
these charges either before or after the election.
6

While not directly related to this study, it has been argued that the election process is too cumbersome
and that employers can manipulate the process through coercive means that make it difficult 1) for unions
to win these elections (e.g., Weiler, 1983; Freeman, 1985) and 2) to reach agreement on a first contract even
where they win elections (Prosten, 1978; Ferguson, 2008). One result of this is a proposed revision of the
NLRA, the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA) that provides for 1) recognition of a union as the bargaining
agent of the workers on the basis of a “card check” and 2) first-contract arbitration, whereby an arbitrator
sets the terms of the first contract in the event that the union and the employer do not reach agreement in
a timely manner. The EFCA was being actively considered by Congress in 2009, but political and economic
realities of the time removed any chance it had for passage. See Johnson (2002) and Riddell (2004) for
analyses of the Canadian experience with card check recognition that imply a substantial advantage to
unions.

between July 1962 and August 2009.7 Of these, 213,548 elections are “certification” elections
to determine if a union should represent a group of currently non-unionized workers. The
remaining 23,474 elections are “decertification” elections to determine if an existing union
should continue to represent a group of currently unionized workers. I focus here only on
the certification elections.
1.2.1

The Level of Election Activity and Union Success in Elections

As shown by the solid line in Figure 1 (left scale), the number of certification elections fell
sharply in the early 1980s, dropping from about 7,000 per year earlier to less than 4,000 per
year in the mid-1980s. The number of elections continued to decline slowly before declining
more sharply again beginning in the late 1990s. The number of elections fell from over 3,000
per year in the late 1990s to about 1,500 per year in the late 2000s. This change indicates
the sharp deterioration in the organizing environment in the early 1980s and between 1999
and 2009.8
7

These are administrative data for federal fiscal years 1963-2009. Early in the period the federal fiscal
year ran from July to June before switching to October to September. I recode the earlier fiscal years to
run from October to September. On this basis, I have data on elections closed during the 1963-2009 fiscal
years (other than those closed in September 2009) as well as during the last quarter of the 1962 fiscal year.
I have compiled these data over a long period using data received from the NLRB. I thank Alexandre Mas
for providing the data from 1962 through 1972. I have not been able to obtain sufficiently detailed data on
election characteristics and outcomes after August 2009.
8

Farber and Western (2001, 2002) investigate the causes of the earlier deterioration.

The union win rate in elections held is shown by the dashed line in figure 1 (right scale).
The union win rate fell from over 55 percent in the mid-1960s to less than 45 percent in the
early 1980s, then slowly increased to about 50 percent by 1999, and then increased sharply
to 70 percent by 2009.
1.2.2

Voter Turnout

Measurement of voter turnout is potentially complicated by the presence of challenged ballots
in many elections. There are challenges in about 40 percent of elections where data are
available on the number of challenges.9 The NLRB investigates the validity of challenges only
if their aggregate number could have changed the election outcome. The number reported
as eligible to vote is the ex ante number, including any workers whose eligibility is later
questioned while the number of pro- and anti-union votes recorded is the number net of
disallowed ballots in cases where challenges are investigated. Thus, a turnout rate calculated
as the ratio of the sum of the pro and con votes to the number reported as eligible will not
be accurate in the presence of sustained challenges unless all challenges are resolved and the
numbers adjusted accordingly. Data are available on the number of challenges sustained only
for fiscal years 2000-2009, but these data show that there are sustained challenges in only
1.7 percent of elections with challenges. On this basis, I ignore challenges in my analysis
and assume that the reported vote counts can be compared appropriately to the reported
number of eligible voters.
I proceed examining turnout in 143,175 elections closed between fiscal years 1973 and
2009.10 I restrict the sample to observations without missing data on key variables in order
to keep the sample fixed as I explore specifications. There are 2,078 elections (1.45 percent
of the sample) with missing data on at least one variable. My final sample contains 141,097
elections.
The broad facts regarding mean turnout based on these data are presented in figure 2.
The average turnout rate across elections held steady at about 89 percent until the late-1990s
and subsequently fell to about 79 percent by 2009. Figure 2 also contains the time series
of the aggregate turnout rate (the ratio of the total number of votes across all elections to
the total number of eligible voters across all elections). The aggregate turnout rate shows
a similar time-series pattern though it falls more sharply, from 89 percent to 70 percent
over the same period. The sharper decline of the aggregate turnout rate reflects a shift in
9

There are no data available on the number of challenges in elections closed prior to July 1972 or in
elections closed before July 1972 or in elections closed between December 1978 and September 1980.

I do not have data on all variables used in my analysis for elections closed prior to fiscal year 1973. As
a result I do not use the data for the 1963-1972 period in what follows.

composition of elections from smaller elections with higher turnout to larger elections with
lower turnout.
Turnout rates in union representation elections are very high compared to those we see
in the usual political elections. This could reflect several factors. First, these elections are
relatively small, averaging 45 to 77 eligible voters and with a median of 20 to 29 eligible
voters, depending on the year, so that a worker’s vote has a reasonable probability of being
pivotal. Second, these elections are about workers’ livelihoods, so the stakes can be very
high. Third, these elections are generally held at the workplace during working hours, so the
cost of voting is relatively low.

An Economic Model of Voting

In this section, I develop an economic model of the decision to vote that highlights the
economic factors influencing turnout. This economic model highlights 1) the probability
that a worker is pivotal (that his/her vote will change the outcome of the election), 2) the
stakes (the difference in value to the potential voter of the different outcomes, a union win
or a union loss in this case), and 3) the costs and benefits of the act of voting itself. I use
this model to organize and interpret the empirical analysis of the decline in voter turnout.
In a rational voter model, the decision to vote is based on a comparison of expected utility
conditional on voting (E(U |V )) with expected utility conditional on not voting (E(U |N V )).
Expected values are used since the outcome of the election is uncertain. Consider the following framework, which borrows heavily from the analysis of Coate, Conlin, and Moro
5

(2008).11
In a given workplace, the expected fraction of workers who are pro-union is denoted by
µ. These workers, if they vote, vote in favor of union representation. Similarly, anti-union
workers, if they vote, vote against union representation. Pro-union workers receive a benefit
of bp > 0 if the union wins the election. Anti-union workers receive a “benefit” of bc < 0 if
the union wins the election. For simplicity, I assume bp = −bc = b in what follows.
I define Ci as the cost of voting to worker i net of the direct benefit worker i receives from
the act of voting itself, independent of any expected benefit that comes from the possibility
that his vote would alter the election outcome. As such, Ci may well be negative. I assume
Ci varies across workers and is distributed with CDF G(·).
A vote is pivotal if it changes the outcome of the election. The NLRA specifies that the
union is certified as the bargaining agent of the workers if and only if a majority of those
voting vote in favor. Thus, unions lose ties. For this reason, a pro-union worker’s vote will
be pivotal only if the election would be tied without his vote, and an anti-union worker’s
vote will be pivotal only if, without his vote, the union would win the election by one vote.
Denote the probability that the vote would be tied without a particular worker’s vote by
∆W+ . Denote the probability that the union would win by one vote without a particular
worker’s vote by ∆W− .
On this basis, a pro-union worker will vote if and only if
Ci ≤ b∆W+ .

(1)

Given the assumed distribution for costs and noting that µ represents the probability that
a randomly selected worker is pro-union, the probability that a randomly selected worker
votes in favor of union representation is
pp = µG(b∆W+ ).

(2)

Analogously, an anti-union worker will vote if and only if
Ci ≤ b∆W− .

(3)

Given the assumed distribution for costs, the probability that a randomly selected worker
votes against union representation is
pc = (1 − µ)G(b∆W− ).

(4)

11
The rational choice theory of voting has a long history, dating at least to Downs (1957) and Riker and
Ordeshook (1968). Further refinement of the models and the introduction of game theoretic considerations,
where decisions to vote depend on the decisions of others, has occurred. Early models are due to Ledyard
(1981) and Palfrey and Rosenthal (1983, 1985). Frerejohn and Fiorina (1974) present an alternative framework for understanding the voting decision based not on expected utility maximization but on the minimax
regret decision criterion.

6

The turnout rate in the election is
pv = pp + pc = µG(b∆W+ ) + (1 − µ)G(b∆W− ).

(5)

The probability that a worker does not vote (the abstention rate) is
pa = 1 − pv = 1 − µG(b∆W+ ) − (1 − µ)G(b∆W− ).

(6)

The probability that a pro-union worker’s vote is pivotal (the probability of a tie not
including the vote of worker i), based on a multinomial distribution for the vote counts, is
IN T (n/2)

∆W+ = P r(np = nc ) =

X
i=0

n!
pi pi pn−2i ,
i!i!(n − 2i)! p c a

(7)

where n = N − 1, the number of eligible voters less one and IN T (·) returns the truncated
integer value of its argument. The probability that an anti-union worker’s vote is pivotal is
the probability that the union wins by one not including the vote of worker i. Based on a
multinomial distribution for the vote counts, this is
IN T ((n−1)/2)

∆W− = P r(np = nc + 1) =

X
i=0

n!
pi+1 pi pn−2i−1 .
(i + 1)!i!(n − 2i − 1)! p c a

(8)

These rather complicated expressions have two key properties:
1. The probability that a worker’s vote is pivotal falls with the number of eligible voters.
This underlies the usual result that the probability that a voter is pivotal falls with
election size.
2. Holding election size fixed, ∆W+ and ∆W− vary directly with the gap between pp and
pc .12

2.1

Empirical Implications of the Economic Model

The probabilities of being pivotal depend on the decisions of all voters. As such, an equilibrium concept is needed to define the outcome. A natural choice is a symmetric Nash
equilibrium such that all voters are making decisions regarding whether to vote consistent
with equations 1 or 3, as appropriate, conditional on common information regarding the fraction pro-union (µ), the distribution of costs (G(·), and the benefit of getting the preferred
outcome (b). While it is not possible to derive closed form solutions for pp and pc , there are
several important empirical predictions of the model. These include
12
The probability of a tie is maximized when pp = pc and the probability that the union wins by one is
maximized when pp is slightly greater than pc , with the optimal gap between pp and pc falling with election
size.

7

1. Turnout will fall as the cost of voting increases (C).
2. Turnout will fall with election size (N ).
3. Holding election size fixed, turnout will increase with the expected closeness of ex ante
preferences for and against union representation (|µ − 0.5|).
4. Turnout will increase with the stakes (b).
To the extent that costs of voting have increased, election size has increased, expected closeness has declined, and/or the stakes have declined, the factors emphasized in the economic
model could account for all or part of the decline in voter turnout since the late 1990s.13

3

The Union Decision to Hold a Representation Election

The set of elections that are held is the result of a selection process by labor unions about how
much organizing to undertake and where to focus their organizing activity. An economically
rational labor union will contest elections only where there is a positive expected value
associated with the election. This suggests that among all possible potential bargaining
units, called “targets” here, elections are more likely when the likelihood of a union victory
is higher. This has important implications for changes in the quantity of election activity,
election outcomes, and voter turnout over time. Clearly, the potential bargaining units in
which elections are held at any point in time are not representative of the pool of targets
as a whole since elections are more likely to be held in places where workers are thought to
be favorable to unions. Additionally, unions may perceive larger benefit to organization in
certain types of workplaces, and, in these cases, they will be willing to contest an election
even where workers may be less favorably disposed to unions.
Consider a union’s decision regarding whether or not to contest an election at a specific
target. The union bases its decision on several factors:14
• the per-worker benefit to the union of a union victory (V ),
13

Unfortunately, I have no measures of the stakes to workers of unionization. My empirical analysis will
focus on variables related to the likelihood of a vote being pivotal and on one variable related to the cost of
voting.
14
I abstract here from the fact that a union victory in many cases does not result in the successful
negotiation of a contract. This difficulty in negotiating a first contract has increased over time. While there
are no systematic data on representative samples of union-won elections, Weiler (1984) analyzed a small
number of surveys and found that the fraction of union wins yielding first contracts fell from 86 percent in
1955 to 63 percent in 1980. Ferguson (2008) reports that only 39 percent of union wins between 1999 and
2004 yielded a first contract. See also, Prosten (1978) and Cooke (1985).

8

• the per-worker cost to the union (net of union dues) of negotiating a contract and
administering a unionized workplace (Ca ),
• the per-worker cost to the union of the organization effort (Co ), and
• the probability of a union victory in an election (π).
The definition of the benefits and costs as per-worker organized (the number of eligible
voters, N ) is simply a normalization that eases exposition.
The per-worker expected value to the union of contesting an election at target i is
E(Vi ) = πi (Vi − Cai ) − Coi .

(9)

A rational union will undertake to organize the target if E(Vi ) is positive. This implies that
the condition for an election to be held is
Coi
πi >
.
(10)
(Vi − Cai )
The right hand side of equation 10 defines a critical value for the probability of a union
victory. This is
Coi
,
(11)
πi∗ =
(Vi − Cai )
and unions will contest elections where πi > πi∗ .
An important characteristic of the target is its size (Ni ). Size may have a direct effect
on the probability of a union victory. Additionally, the number of workers could also have
an important effect on the appeal of the target to the union even holding the probability
of a union victory fixed. A union victory in a large election could have important positive
spillovers for the union in terms of bargaining leverage and “marketing value” in other
∂Vi
organizing campaigns ( ∂N
> 0). Additionally, perhaps due to the existence of fixed costs,
i
oi
there are likely to be decreasing costs per worker of holding the organizing drive ( ∂C
< 0)
∂Ni
and decreasing costs per member of servicing a bargaining unit once there is a union victory
ai
( ∂C
< 0). Together, these imply that the critical value for the probability of a union victory
∂Ni
∂π ∗

is decreasing in election size ( ∂Nii < 0) so that unions will contest larger elections where they
have a smaller chance of winning. This selection by unions implies that observed union win
rates will be negatively related to the number of eligible voters.
This prediction is supported by evidence on union win rates in elections of various sizes.
Figure 3 contains plots of the union win rate and pro-union vote share rate in elections by
number of eligible voters. Consistent with the union selection model, union win rates and
pro-union vote shares fall with election size.15
15
Farber (2001) presents an analysis of election outcomes that uses this model to understand the relationship of outcomes with election size.

Pro-Union Vote Share

Substantial evidence exists that the political and legal environment for unions worsened
substantially in the early 1980’s (Weiler (1990), Gould (1993), and Levy (1985)). This could
affect both the distribution of π and the cost of organization to the union (Co ). A shift
to the left in the distribution of π (implying fewer good targets for organization) does not,
by itself, imply a change in the critical value for the probability of a union victory (π ∗ ).
The first-order result will be that fewer elections will be held. But, since the selection rule
remains unchanged, union success in elections that are held will not be greatly affected.16
However, it is likely that the adverse changes in the organizing environment increase the
cost of organization (Co ). The result will be an increase in π ∗ implying that the set of elections actually contested will, on average, offer a higher probability of union success. Taken
together, the effects of adverse changes in the organizing environment on the distribution
of π and on Co will result in fewer elections being held and greater union success in those
elections that are held. This is consistent with the increase in union win rates over time
shown in figure 1.
Another implication of the model for the composition of elections held as the organizing
environment worsens is that unions will tend to organize larger potential bargaining units.
This results from an increase in the fixed component of organizing costs due to the deteriorating environment. Since these increased fixed costs are spread over more workers in
larger potential bargaining units, the effect on per-worker costs of organization will decline
16

In fact, the extent to which union success will be affected depends on the underlying distribution of π
before and after the shift.

with unit size. As a result, unions will be cut back organizing of smaller units more than
organizing of larger units. The time-series pattern of average unit size, shown by the dashed
line in figure 4 (right scale), generally shows the expected increase in unit size over time.
However, the growth is not monotone. Average election size grew substantially from 45 in
1983 to 67 in 2000 before falling subsequently to 58 in 2009.

3.1

Implications of the Model for the Decline in Turnout

The deterioration of the union organizing environment changes the characteristics of the
potential bargaining units selected by unions in at least two important ways that may be
related to turnout.
First, if the move toward elections that are more pro-union as the organizing environment
deteriorates results in a set of elections that are less closely contested, voters will be less likely
to be pivotal and average turnout will fall. Whether a movement toward more pro-union
elections, in fact, makes elections less close, on average, depends on whether or not, on
average, at least half of the workers in the initial set of elections chosen were pro-union.
Recall that µj is the fraction of workers in election j who are pro-union. If the average µj is
less than 0.5, then a moderate increase in µj resulting from unions selecting more favorable
targets will make elections closer as |µj − 0.5| falls. Once µj reaches 0.5, any further in µj
will make elections less close as |µj − 0.5| increases.
As illustrated by the solid line in figure 4 (left scale), the average pro-union vote share
is at least 0.5 in all years but 1981 and 1982 (when it is 0.496 and 0.486, respectively). The

11

average pro-union vote share increased slowly from about 0.5 in the early 1980s to about
0.55 in the late 1990s. Subsequently, the average pro-union vote share increased sharply
from 0.55 in 1999 to 0.69 in 2009. Clearly, elections have become substantially less close
since the late 1990s, and the timing of this increase is remarkably similar to the timing of
the decrease in voter turnout (figure 2).
Second, unions will attempt to organize larger bargaining units, on average, as the organizing environment deteriorates. The model of the individual vote decision predicts that this
will reduce turnout as voters are less likely to be pivotal in larger elections. The evidence in
figure 4 shows that the period of growth in election size coincides with the deterioration in
the organizing environment beginning in the 1980s. However, the decline in average election
size between 1999 and 2009 suggests that changing election size is not a factor that will
explain the decline in voter turnout over that period.

A Statistical Description of Turnout Rates

In order to simplify the analysis, I assume that individuals’ decisions to vote are independent
in a given election. Let Pp , Pc , and Pa = (1−Pp −Pc ) represent, respectively, the probabilities
that an individual votes for union representation, votes against union representation, or does
not vote. In this case, the number of pro-, anti-, and non-votes (np , nc , and na respectively)
has a multinomial distribution such that
P r(np , nc , na ) =

N!
pnp pnc pna
np !nc !na ! p c a

(12)

where N = np + nc + na is the total number of eligible voters.
The simplest statistical model of the turnout rate is a binomial model that is derived
from the multinomial model of the pro-union, anti-union, abstain vote probability specified
in equation 12. In this model, the probability that a worker in a particular election votes is
p = pp + pc , and the probability that a worker in that election does not vote is 1 − p. The
number of votes cast in the election (v) with N eligible voters has a binomial distribution
such that
 
N v
P r(v|N ) =
p (1 − p)N −v .
(13)
v
Given that voting probabilities vary across elections, I specify p as a linear function of a
vector of variables, X so that p = Xβ, and this is also the expected turnout rate.
A model such as this may fit mean turnout rates quite well, but it does not tell the whole
story. If there is unmeasured variation across elections of a given size and other observed
characteristics in the probability of a worker voting, then this model will under-predict
dispersion across elections in turnout rates. In order to address this problem, I allow the
probability that a worker votes to vary across elections, and I assume that these probabilities
12

follow a beta distribution. This distribution has positive density only on the unit interval,
and it has the additional advantages of having a flexible functional form and of yielding a
tractable result when mixed with the binomial distribution (Evans, Hastings, and Peacock,
1993).
On this basis, I assume that p is distributed as beta such that
g(p; m, α) =

Γ(α)
pmα−1 (1 − p)(1−m)α−1 ,
Γ(mα)Γ((1 − m)α)

where m and α are positive parameters and Γ(·) is the gamma function defined as
Z ∞
Γ(x) =
exp(−z)z x−1 dz.

(14)

(15)

0

The parameters of this beta distribution (m and α) have convenient relationships with the
mean and variance of the distribution of p:17
• The expected value of p is m, and
• The variance of p is σp2 = m(1 − m)/(1 + α).
Over-dispersion is captured by the parameter α. As α → ∞, the variance of p goes to zero..
Smaller values of α imply positive variance in the expected fraction voting across elections.
The conditional (on a particular value of p) distribution of the number of votes cast is
given in equation 13. Integrating over the beta prior distribution for p (equation 14), the
expression for the unconditional probability of the number of votes cast in an election with
N eligible voters is
 
N Γ(α)Γ(mα + v)Γ((1 − m)α + N − v)
f (v|N ) =
.
(16)
v
Γ(mα)Γ((1 − m)α)Γ(N + α)
In order to illustrate the importance of allowing for unmeasured variation in p and to
provide a baseline for the decline over time in turnout, I start by estimating a simple binomial
model of the turnout rate at the election level where the probability that an individual votes
(p) is a linear function of a set of year fixed effects. I estimate this model using the sample
of 141,097 elections between fiscal years 1973 and 2009 described above. I then estimate the
beta-binomial model with the parameter m (the mean of the distribution of the probability
of voting) also specified as a linear function of year fixed effects.18 The beta-binomial model
17

The beta distribution has a flexible functional form. The distribution is uni-modal (inverse U-shaped)
if mα > 1 and (1 − m)α > 1. Otherwise, the distribution is bimodal (U- or J- shaped). A special case is
that the distribution is uniform if α = 2 and m = 0.5.
18
Analogously to the specification of p in the binomial model as p = Xβ, I specify m = Xβ. This
allows the mean vote probability across elections to vary with observable variables. Introducing observable
variables correlated with p in this way will generally increase the estimate of α in the beta distribution, as
less variation is attributed to unobservables.

adds a single parameter (α) and improves the log-likelihood dramatically (from -750,302.6
in the binomial case to -334,411.8 in the beta-binomial case). The estimated value of α in
the beta-binomial is 7.61 (s.e. = 0.0432). This estimate implies substantial variation across
elections in the vote probability. At a value for the mean probability of voting of 0.873 (the
estimated value of m for 1999), the implied standard deviation of the vote probability is
0.113.
I next estimate an augmented specification of the beta-binomial model that additionally
allows the parameter α to vary by year (adding an additional 36 parameters). This is
equivalent to estimating a separate beta-binomial model for each year, and this specification
has the important advantage of allowing the variance of the vote probability to vary by year
with a degree of freedom in addition to the effect of the mean.19 The fit of the model is
further improved (log-likelihood of -330,224.0). I continue using the augmented specification
of the beta-binomial with year fixed effects determining α.
Figure 5 contains a plot of the estimated density function for p assuming a mean vote
probability of m = 0.877 and α = 8.94 as estimated for fiscal year 1999 using the betabinomial model for election turnout. The figure illustrates that there are many elections
with very high expected vote probabilities. The standard deviation of this distribution is
0.1042 and the 75th and 90th percentiles of this distribution are 0.956 and 0.982 respectively.
There are substantial numbers of elections with very high turnout probabilities (well above
the estimated mean of 0.877).
19

In fact, the variance of the probability of voting has been changing over time. When α is allowed to
vary by year, the standard deviation of the probability of voting implied by the year-specific estimates of α
increases by 65 percent between 1999 and 2009. If I did not allow for this movement over time in α, changes
in the variance over time could substantially affect the estimates of the yearly mean vote probabilities.

Figure 6 presents plots of the estimated year effects (1999=0) in the predicted mean
probability that an individual votes from the binomial and beta-binomial models. The year
effects from the binomial model reflect changes from 1999 in the probability of voting in
elections with no allowance for heterogeneity across elections. Consistent with the observed
decline in overall average turnout shown in figure 2, there is a sharp drop in average turnout of
about 18 percentage points between 1999 and 2009. The estimates from the beta-binomial
model, which allows for variation across elections in the individual probability of voting,
shows a smaller but still substantial decline of 11.7 percentage points in the mean of the
distribution of vote probabilities over the same period. This is very close to the 12 percentage
point decline in election average turnout shown in figure 2.

Statistical Analysis of the Decline in Mean Turnout

The first column of table 1 contains estimates of the beta-binomial model with fiscal year
fixed effects determining both parameters of the distribution (m (the mean) and α). This is
equivalent to estimating separate models for each fiscal year with common parameters across
all elections in a given year. I take the decline in mean turnout estimated in this model of
11.7 percentage points (s.e. = 0.007) between 1999 and 2009, shown in the solid line in figure
6, as the decline for which an accounting is needed.
I now add variables in sequence that can affect the the mean probability of voting in
order to account for the decline in turnout since 1999.

5.1

Mode of Election

The large majority of representation elections are held on site (at the workplace). However,
beginning around 1990, a small but increasing fraction of elections have been conducted by
mail or with a combination of on-site and mail ballots (mixed elections) rather than on-site.
It is likely that mail elections impose a greater cost burden on potential voters, and the
economic model predicts that turnout will fall with the cost of voting. This suggests that
the shift toward mail ballots could account for some of the decline in turnout.
NLRB procedures regarding representation cases state that mail balloting is used only
in unusual circumstances at the discretion of the NLRB Regional Director.20 While there is

no information on the mode of election prior to fiscal year 1984, only 1.1 percent of elections
between 1984 and 1990 were mail or mixed elections. On this basis, I proceed assuming that
all elections prior to fiscal 1984 were carried out on-site. From 1991 onward, 93.8 percent
of elections were on-site, 5.9 percent were by mail ballot, 0.3 percent were mixed.21 In my
analysis, I combine the mail and mixed elections into a single category that I call “mail”.
Figure 7 contains a time-series plot of the fraction of elections that are by mail. The
fraction of elections with mail ballots increased from less than 1 percent in 1984 to 6.5 percent
in 1999. Subsequently the fraction with mail ballots increased further to about 12 percent
by 2002 before declining to 9 percent by 2009. I have no explanation for the increase in use
of mail ballots in the last two decades.
Figure 8 contains plots of turnout in mail and on-site elections by fiscal year. Average
turnout was much lower in mail elections (69.7 percent) than in on-site elections (87.7 percent) held between 1984 and 2009. Turnout fell in on-site elections since the late 1990s,
but it fell much more in mail elections. The increased use of mail elections combined with
the lower and falling turnout in mail elections has the potential to account for some of the
“Mail balloting is used, if at all, in unusual circumstances, particularly where eligible voters are scattered
either because of their duties or their work schedules or in situations where there is a strike, picketing, or
lockout in progress. In these situations the Regional Director considers mail balloting taking into consideration the desires of the parties, the ability of voters to understand mail ballots, and the efficient use of
Board personnel.” NLRB procedures also allow for limited mixed elections, with ballots for those eligible
voters who cannot vote in person. This does not include absentees or those who are on vacation. See
http://www.nlrb.gov/publications/manuals/r - case outline.aspx. Accessed on September 25, 2009.
21

Not surprisingly, given the fact that mail balloting is used at the discretion of the regional director is
that there is substantial variation across NLRB regions in usage rate of mail balloting. Between 1984 and
2009 the usage rate of mail balloting ranged from less than two percent in the Newark office to more than
12 percent in the Seattle office.

I re-estimated the beta-binomial model including additionally an indicator for mail elections in the mean (m) function, and the results are contained in column 2 of table 1. The
fit of the model is improved significantly, and the estimates imply that the mean probability
of voting is 11.64 percentage points lower in mail elections than in on-site elections. The
shift toward mail elections can account for 0.83 percentage points (7.1 percent) of the 11.68
percentage point decline in the mean probability of voting between 1999 and 2009 (compare
columns 1 and 2 of table 1).

5.2

Region and Industry

The distribution of elections by region and industry has shifted substantially in the last 30
years. In this section, I examine the extent to which these shifts can account for the decline
in turnout in representation elections.
Figure 9 contains plots of the distribution of elections across NLRB offices in the four
census regions.22 This figure shows that, since the mid-1990s, the distribution of elections
has shifted away from the Midwest (falling from 36 percent in 1991-95 to 27 percent in
2006-09) and toward the Northeast (increasing from 24 percent in 1991-95 to 34 percent in
2006-09). Turnout over the sample period was slightly higher in the Midwest region (89.1
percent) than in the Northeast region (87.0 percent) so that the geographic shift in the locus
of elections has the potential to explain part, but certainly not all, of the decline in turnout.
22

In the estimation of the beta-binomial model where I include controls for region, I use indicators for
each of the 8 Census divisions containing NLRB offices rather than the cruder 4-category census region.

Figure 10: Industrial Distribution of Elections Over Time

Figure 10 contains plots of the distribution of elections across broad industry groups.23
The two important changes over time are a steady decline in the share of elections in manufacturing (from 44 percent in the 1970s to 16 percent in the 2006-09 period) and a steady
increase in the share of election in service industries (from 16 percent in the 1970s to 40
percent in the 2006-09 period). Average turnout is substantially higher in manufacturing
23
There are a few small (in terms of number of elections) industry groups not included in this figure. They
are agriculture, forestry, and fisheries (0.08 percent of elections), mining (0.90 percent), finance, insurance,
and real estate (1.90 percent), and public administration (0.39 percent).

elections (90.9 percent) than in elections in services (84.7 percent). Thus, while the timing
of the shift in the industrial distribution of elections does not match the timing of the drop
in turnout (compare figures 6 and 10), the change in industrial distribution has the potential
to explain some (but again not all) of the decline in turnout.
The third column of table 1 contains estimates of the beta-binomial model of turnout that
additionally includes indicators for 8 Census regions and 9 industry categories. These variables contribute significantly to the fit, reducing the log-likelihood by 2,617.7, but changes
in the distribution of elections by industry and region account for only a small part of the
decline in the mean probability of voting between 1999 and 2009. The estimated decline, calculated from the year fixed effects in the mean, falls by 0.58 percentage points (5.3 percent),
from 10.85 percentage points without controlling for industry and region to 10.27 percentage
points when accounting for these variables (compare columns 2 and 3 of table 1).
It might be the case that the variation in turnout by region and industry reflects differences in economic incentives. For example, the stakes to the workers of unionization or
the cost of organization might differ by industry or region. However, I have no specific
expectations regarding how economic incentives to vote might vary in these dimensions.
Taken together, changes in the distribution of elections by industry, region, and mode
account for 1.4 percentage points (12 percent) of the 11.7 percentage point decline in the
mean probability of voting between 1999 and 2009 (compare columns 1 and 3 of table 1).

5.3

Election Size and Voter Turnout

The economic model of voter turnout has the clear prediction that, because the probability
that a vote will be pivotal declines with election size, turnout will be lower in elections with
more eligible voters. This is supported by figure 11, which show that turnout falls sharply
with the number of eligible voters. The model of union organizing behavior implies that
unions will contest larger elections, on average, as the organizing environment becomes less
favorable. Figure 4 shows that average election size increased between the mid-1980s and
2000 and subsequently fell back to the level of the mid-1990s. Since the average number of
eligible voter in elections held has been declining since 2000, changing election size is not
likely to explain the decline in turnout over this period. Nonetheless, it is important to
examine the relationship between turnout and election size.
I re-estimated the beta-binomial model additionally including two variables to capture
the effect of election size on turnout. The first is the logarithm of the number eligible for
number eligible less than or equal to 100. This variable (log(N ) · I(N <= 100)), equals
zero for elections with more than 100 eligible voters. The second is a dummy variable for
elections with more than 100 voters. In other words, I specify the effect of size as a log linear
function of number eligible for elections with no more than 100 eligible voters (86 percent of

elections) and a constant value for larger elections.24
The results of this estimation are contained in column 4 of table 1. These estimates confirm that the mean probability of voting falls significantly with election size. The estimates
imply that an increase in election size from 10 to 100 eligible voters reduces the mean vote
probability by 3.5 percentage points.25 The change in the mean probability of voting between 1999 and 200 is virtually unaffected by controlling for election size (compare columns
3 and 4 of table 1). Given that average election size was declining between 2000 and 2009,
it is not surprising that none of the decline in the mean vote probability can be accounted
for by this factor.

5.4

Expected Closeness of the Election

As I discussed earlier, the model of union organizing behavior implies that, as the bargaining
environment deteriorates, unions will try to organize workplaces where they have a larger
24

Fitting a linear spline with a single knot at log(100) yielded a virtually identical fit. Experimentation
with knots at other values yielded very similar results. Estimation with sets of dummy variables for various
values of size (e.g., dummy variables for each value from 1-20 eligible and for 4 larger categories) did not
improve the fit of the model.
25

The choice of N = 100 as the point where the vote probability function flattens is supported by the
estimates. The specification enforces a constant mean vote probability for elections with N > 100 that is
6.89 percentage points lower than the vote probability with N = 1. This is very close to the value predicted
(7.09 percentage points) for the difference in vote probability between N = 1 and N = 100 by the downward
sloping part of the function.

21

chance of success. I presented evidence in section 3.1 that the movement toward elections
with a higher pro-union vote share will result in elections being less close, on average.
The economic model of the vote/no-vote decision I presented in section 2 implies that a
worker’s vote is more likely to be pivotal when preferences are close to evenly split between
pro- and anti-union.26 An even split of preferences is represented in the model µ = 0.5.
While µ is not observed, I assume that elections differ in their underlying fraction pro-union
and that there is a known prior distribution for µ. I develop a useful proxy for µ in a
particular election based on the posterior distribution of µ given a beta prior distribution for
µ and the observed pro-union vote share in that election. The inverse measure of closeness
that I use is the expected squared deviation of the pro-union vote share from 0.5. This is
E((µ − 0.5)2 |s), where s is the number of pro-union votes.
In order to derive an estimate of E((µ − 0.5)2 |s) for each election in my sample, I develop
and estimate a statistical model of the pro-union vote share in elections. I start with a simple
binomial model of the number of pro-union votes. Recall that µ is the fraction of the eligible
voters who are pro-union, and assume that pro- and anti-union workers vote with the same
probability. In this case, the probability that there are s pro-union votes cast in an election
with n total votes cast is
 
n s
P r(s|n) =
µ (1 − µ)n−s .
(17)
s
Because µ can vary across elections with both observable variables and unobservables, I
assume that µ has a beta distribution across elections. The beta density function for µ is
g(µ; θ, ν) =

Γ(ν)
µθν−1 (1 − µ)(1−θ)ν−1 .
Γ(θν)Γ((1 − θ)ν)

(18)

The parameters of this distribution (θ and ν) have convenient relationships with the mean
and variance of the distribution of µ:
• The expected value of µ is θ, and
• The variance of µ is σµ2 = θ(1 − θ)/(1 + ν).
Over-dispersion is captured by the parameter ν. As ν → ∞, the variance of µ goes to zero.
Smaller values of ν imply larger variance in the expected fraction pro-union across elections.
The expression for the unconditional beta-binomial distribution of s pro-union votes cast
out of n total votes is
 
n Γ(ν)Γ(θν + s)Γ((1 − θ)ν + n − s)
f (s|n) =
.
(19)
s
Γ(θν)Γ((1 − θ)ν)Γ(n + ν)
26
I say “close to evenly split” rather than “evenly split” because pro-union voters are more likely to be
pivotal when the expected vote is evenly split without their vote. In this case, the overall expected fraction
pro-union is somewhat greater than 0.5, with the difference from 0.5 declining with election size.

22

The goal of this exercise is to compute the (inverse) measure of closeness, E((µ − 0.5)2 |s).
This is calculated from the posterior distribution of the number of pro-union votes (a mixture
of the beta prior distribution and the observed number of pro-union votes).27 The workplacespecific posterior mean of µ given the observed pro-union vote share is

This is a weighted average of the observed pro-union vote share and the prior mean. The

where E(µ|s) is defined in equation 20. In order to calculate this measure, I need estimates
of the parameters θ and ν. I use equation 19 to form a likelihood function using data on the
number of pro-union and total votes cast in each election. I allow for observable variation
across elections in the mean pro-union vote probability by specifying the mean (θ) as a
function of observable variables (θ = Xδ).
Based on preliminary examination of the data on variation in the pro-union vote share
with the number of eligible voters, I include the same two measures in X to account for
election size that I used in the turnout analysis. These are 1) the logarithm of the number
eligible for number eligible less than or equal to 100 and 2) an indicator variable for elections
with more than 100 voters. As suggested by the model of union behavior, I expect that
the fraction pro-union will be negatively related to election size due to the process used by
unions to select targets for organization. The X vector additionally includes an indicator for
mail elections and controls for 8 regions, 9 industries, and 37 fiscal years. The parameter ν,
which controls the variance, is specified as a function of year fixed effects.
I estimate this beta-binomial model using the data on the 141,097 elections underlying
the turnout analysis. The estimated year effects for the mean pro-union vote probability
show an increase since 1999 of about 15 percentage points. This is consistent with the trend
in the pro-union vote share in the raw data illustrated in figure 4. While not presented
formally, the results show a strong and significant negative relationship between the prounion share and the number of eligible voters. The predicted mean pro-union vote share is
about 9 percentage points lower in elections with 50 eligible voters than in elections with 10
eligible voters. This pattern is consistent with the model of union organizing behavior.

There is substantial heterogeneity across elections of a given size in the fraction prounion. Using 1999 as an example,
the estimate of ν for 1999 is 4.04. The implied standard

deviation of µ for 1999 is θ(1−θ)
ν+1
in 1999), the standard deviation of µ is 0.221.
With these estimates in hand, I predict the expected value of µ conditional on the observed pro-union vote share in each election in my sample based on equation 20. I then use,
this together with equation 21, to calculate the inverse metric of expected closeness for each
election (E((µ − 0.5)2 |s)).
Figure 12 contains a bar graph of the average turnout rate for various levels of the square
root of the inverse closeness index. There is clear evidence that the turnout rate drops
p
substantially as E(µ − 0.5)2 |s exceeds 0.2. This is consistent with a worker’s vote/no-vote
decision being positively related to the probability of being pivotal.
The solid line in figure 13 (left scale) is a plot of the yearly average of the inverse measure
of expected closeness (E((µ − 0.5)2 |s)). This was fairly constant through the late 1990s but
increased sharply between 1999 and 2009. This reflects the increase in pro-union vote share
away from 0.5 over the same period, shown by the dashed line in figure 13 (right scale), that
results from union selection of more favorable organizing targets in a deteriorating organizing
environment. Clearly, elections have become less close since the late 1990s, and the timing of
this increase is remarkably similar to the timing of the decrease in voter turnout (figure 2).
There is potential for the declining closeness of elections between 1999 and 2009 to account
for at least some of the decline in turnout over the this period.
I re-estimated the beta-binomial model of turnout additionally including the inverse
closeness measure, and the resulting estimates are contained in column 5 of table 1. The

estimates show a strong and significant negative relationship between the inverse measure of
closeness and the mean probability of voting. Turnout is clearly higher in elections that are
expected to be closer, and the move toward elections that are expected be less close accounts
for a substantively important share of the decline in voter turnout between 1999 and 2009.
The average value of E((µ − 0.5)2 |s) increased from 0.054 in 1999 to 0.108 in 2009, and point
estimate of its coefficient in column 5 of table 1 is -0.3981. This reduction in average closeness
implies a decrease in voter turnout between 1999 and 2009 of 0.3981·(0.108−0.054) = 0.0215
(2.15 percentage points). More directly, the change in the 2009 year effect (1999=0) on the
mean vote probability declines in magnitude from -0.1030 to -0.0804 when controlling for
expected election closeness (compare columns 4 and 5 of table 1). Thus, the decline in
expected election closeness accounts for fully 2.26 percentage points (about 22 percent) of
the remaining 10.3 percentage point decline in the average vote probability since 1999.

Final Remarks

In order to summarize my analysis of the decline in voter turnout, figure 14 presents the estimated year effects on the mean vote probability (m) from 1990-2009 (differenced from 1999)
from three versions of the beta-binomial model of the vote probability.28 The “unadjusted”
set are the year effects from the model without other control variables for the mean (column
1 of table 1). This shows the 11.7 percentage point decline in the mean vote probability
28

The estimated year effects prior to 1990 do not vary substantially over time.

between 1999 and 2009. The second set shows year effects from the model with controls
for region, industry, election mode, and election size (column 4 of table 1). These controls
account for 1.4 percentage points of the decline in the mean vote probability. Finally, the
third set shows year effects from the model with an additional control for expected election
closeness (column 5 of table 1). The closeness measure alone accounts for another 2.26 percentage points (19 percent) of the 11.7 point decline between 1999 and 2009 in the mean vote
probability (compare columns 1 and 5 of table 1). The remaining 8 percentage point decline
in the mean probability of voting is not accounted for by observed election characteristics.
In conclusion, the continuing deterioration the union organizing environment has made
organizing through the NLRB representation election process more costly. The first-order
consequence of this deterioration is that there are many fewer representation elections, but
it has also made unions more selective in choosing targets for organization. Unions now
undertake organization in potential bargaining units that are larger, where they have a
higher probability of victory, and where the resulting elections are less close. The result is
an increase in the union win rate and a decline in voter turnout in elections held.

the Beta-Binomial Distribution
I assume that µ, the probability of a voter casting his vote in favor of union representation
in a given election, is distributed as beta such that
g(µ; θ, ν) =

Γ(ν)
µθν−1 (1 − µ)(1−θ)ν−1 ,
Γ(θν)Γ((1 − θ)ν)

where θ and ν are positive parameters and Γ(·) is the gamma function defined as

By the Bayes theorem, the distribution of µ conditional on observing s pro-union votes
among n total votes cast is
h(s|µ)g(µ)

Assuming a binomial distribution for pro-union votes in a given election, the probability of

Thus, the posterior mean of the pro-union share in the workplace given the pro-union share
of votes in the election is a weighted average of the observed vote share and the prior mean.29

B(a, b) =

and the property of Gamma functions that Γ(Z + 1) = ZΓ(Z).
