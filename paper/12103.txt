ABSTRACT

Neoclassical growth models predict that reductions in capital or labor tax rates are expansionary
when lump-sum transfers are used to balance the government budget. This paper explores the
consequences of bond-financed tax reductions that bring forth a range of possible offsetting
policies, including future government consumption, capital tax rates, or labor tax rates. Through
the resulting intertemporal distortions, current tax cuts can be contractionary. The paper also
finds that more aggressive responses of offsetting policies to debt engender less debt
accumulation and less costly tax cuts.

ERIC M. LEEPER AND SHU-CHUN SUSAN YANG

1. Introduction
In a recent paper, Mankiw and Weinzierl (forthcoming) brought modern quantitative macroeconomic analysis to bear on an important and timely policy issue: can
permanent tax rate cuts stimulate economic growth and raise the tax base enough
to oﬀset some of the revenue loss? They address this issue of dynamic scoring in a
conventional neoclassical growth model. A calibrated version of the model suggests
that permanent reduction in capital (labor) tax rates can stimulate growth enough
to oﬀset 53 percent (17 percent) of the revenue loss. In their exercises, Mankiw and
Weinzierl also find that static scoring always overstates the revenue loss of tax cuts.
In this paper, as in Mankiw and Weinzierl, dynamic scoring evaluates revenue
eﬀects of a tax proposal using dynamic macroeconomic models. This is distinguished
from static scoring, which is defined as the revenue consequences of tax changes when
there is no feedback from output or any other behavioral response to taxes. Although
static scoring is sometimes equated to the methods employed by government agencies,
such as the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), estimates by the JCT
incorporate feedback eﬀects from microdynamic behavior [see Joint Committee on
Taxation (2005) and Auerbach (2005) for details].1
Mankiw and Weinzierl’s provocative results hinge on the maintained assumption
that lump-sum transfers are permanently cut to balance the government’s budget
in the face of any revenues losses. Given the vagaries of the political system, this
Ricardian equivalent outcome is at best a benchmark scenario. To the extent that a
reduction in one fiscal distortion is replaced by a change in some other distortion, or

The dynamic and static scoring exercises in this paper, as in Mankiw and Weinzierl, diﬀer from
the practices at the JCT, Congressional Budget Oﬃce, and Treasury. In practice, conventional
revenue estimation incorporates macroeconomic forecast under existing tax laws and microeconomic
dynamic adjustment under proposed tax law changes.

combination of distortions, Mankiw and Weinzierl’s results are likely to change. This
paper examines the robustness of their dynamic scores by considering alternative fiscal
responses to permanent tax-rate cuts. We find that the assumption that transfers do
all the adjusting is critical to Mankiw and Weinzierl’s sanguine conclusions. Policy
makers considering persistent changes in tax rates would do well to consider a range
of possible fiscal responses to the resulting revenue shortfall.
Two conclusions emerge from this paper. First, a debt-financed tax cut does not
always have the positive growth eﬀects obtained in neoclassical models without debt.
The growth eﬀects of a tax cut depend crucially on which fiscal policy is adjusted.
Hence, there is no guarantee that static estimates of revenue eﬀects of tax cuts, which
assume no feedback from changing tax bases, necessarily overstate the revenue loss,
as Mankiw and Weinzierl (forthcoming) conclude. Second, how aggressively policy
responds to debt matters for the growth eﬀects of tax policy. Among distorting
policies that ensure sustainability, a stronger response yields a smaller long-run debtoutput ratio and more favorable growth consequences from a tax cut.
2. Background
Neoclassical growth models have become the main framework for studying the
macroeconomic eﬀects of fiscal policy, at least since Baxter and King (1993). When
income tax rates are reduced and the government budget is balanced by lump-sum
taxes or transfers, this class of models generates substantial growth, arising from
higher expected returns to labor and investment.
Growth eﬀects of tax cuts are often cited in policy debates to advocate tax cuts.
While it is not uncommon for Congress to cut transfer payments when faced with
revenue shortfalls, the federal government frequently resorts to borrowing instead,
postponing the inevitable adjustments in spending or taxes. The federal debt-GDP
ratio climbed from 57.4 percent in 2001 to 65.7 percent in 2005 [estimate from Economic Report of the President (2005)], partially due to the series of tax cuts since
2001. Demographic trends are expected to create persistent increases in Social Security, Medicare, and other transfer programs well into the 21st century [Congressional
Budget Oﬃce (2002)], making the maintained assumption that tax cuts are funded
through transfer reductions an increasingly unlikely scenario.
Since the well-publicized assertion of the Laﬀer (1979) curve, research has attempted to find its theoretical underpinnings. The supply-side argument that cutting
taxes generates growth is well demonstrated by endogenous growth models, where
the steady state economic growth rate rises when income tax rates are lowered [King
and Rebelo (1990)]. Ireland (1994) further shows that the expansionary eﬀects of a

DYNAMIC SCORING: ALTERNATIVE FINANCING SCHEMES

debt-financed tax cut can be strong enough to pay oﬀ debt in the long run without
oﬀsetting fiscal policy, if the growth rate after a tax cut outpaces the growth rate of
government debt. However, subsequent studies by Bruce and Turnovsky (1999) and
Novales and Ruiz (2002) find that tax cuts can improve the long-run budget only for
a relatively high elasticity of intertemporal substitution of consumption. While doubt
remains about whether a deficit-financed tax cut can actually be self-financing, this
paper considers circumstances in which such a tax cut induces future fiscal policy
adjustments that maintain a sustainable budget.
We use a standard neoclassical growth model with government debt and separate
distorting taxation on capital and labor income. Since the steady state growth rate
of the economy is invariant to fiscal policy, debt-financed tax cuts necessarily involve
adjustments in future policy to ensure that the government’s intertemporal budget
constraint holds. Expectations of future policies interact with labor and investment
incentives from a current tax cut. Mankiw and Weinzierl (forthcoming) use the same
type of model without debt to show that while capital or labor tax cuts cannot
pay for themselves fully as suggested by the Laﬀer curve, the revenue feedback from
economic growth is substantial. Because tax cuts are financed by reductions in lumpsum transfers, intertemporal interactions with future policies are eliminated from their
model. This paper shows that eliminating those intertemporal margins has important
consequences for the growth eﬀects of tax cuts.2
Specifically, we consider permanent reductions in capital or labor tax rates. Fiscal
sustainability is ensured by one of three possible policy responses: (1) lower future
government transfer-output ratios, (2) lower future government spending-output ratios, or (3) future increases in other tax rates. We assume the adjustments arise
intertemporally through policy rules that make fiscal variables respond to deviations
of debt-GDP from its steady-state value. The simple policy rules adopted in this
paper are an abstraction designed to capture the practice of fiscal policy: when the
fiscal budget deteriorates, explicit fiscal actions typically are taken to improve the
budget situation.
For state governments, oﬀsetting fiscal policy is triggered relatively quickly, as most
state constitutions require balancing the budget within a couple of years. No analogous statutory requirement constrains federal behavior, and oﬀsetting policy actions
can take much longer to be implemented. For example, when the debt-output ratio
2Baxter

and King (1993) and Ludvigson (1996) also use exogenous growth models to investigate
fiscal policy eﬀects where lump-sum taxes or transfers are not allowed to be used to balance the
budget. In these two papers, tax policy is the endogenous oﬀsetting policy, which occurs contemporaneously to satisfy the government budget constraint each period.

rose rapidly in the early and mid-1980s (partly due to the large tax cuts in the Economic Recovery Act of 1981), the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced-budget law was
enacted in 1985 to reduce deficits. In addition, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Acts of 1990 and 1993, which increased individual and corporate income tax rates,
were passed to reduce government debt. The quickly rising debt-GDP ratio since 2001
again has spurred calls for cutting federal deficits [Greenspan (2005a) and Greenspan
(2005b)].
Aside from anecdotal examples, some econometric evidence finds that policy makers
systematically take corrective measures in response to rising debt levels. Using longterm U.S. data from 1916 to 1995, Bohn (1998) concludes that the primary surplus is
an increasing function of the debt-GDP ratio, and the ratio is mean-reverting, after
controlling for war-time spending and for cyclical fluctuations. Davig and Leeper
(2005) estimate a regime switching rule for tax policy over the post-war period in the
U.S. and find that policy swings between periods when taxes pursue a countercyclical
objective and periods when they respond aggressively to debt. Davig (2005) uses a
Markov-switching model to test the global sustainability of U.S. post-war budget; he
finds that threats to long-run sustainability posed by expanding periods of discounted
debt are mitigated by the expectation of returning to a regime where debt is repaid.
This evidence underscores the empirical relevance of considering alternative fiscal
adjustments to tax reductions.3
3. The Model
The model economy consists of a government and a large number of infinitely-lived,
identical households and firms.

maximize expected utility, given by

work in the style of Bohn’s suﬀers from a potential identification problem. Intertemporal government budget balance ensures that in any equilibrium there is a positive relationship
between the value of debt and future net-of-interest surpluses. It is diﬃcult to distinguish whether
regressions of surpluses against debt represent the rule governing the fiscal authority’s behavior
or merely reflect a correlation that is a necessary implication of equilibrium. Markov switching
estimates can be immune to this identification problem.

We refer to the q’s in rules (1)-(4) as the “fiscal adjustment parameters.” Sign
restrictions on qK , qL , and qG , summarized in table 1, are straightforward. When the
debt-output ratio is above steady state, one of the future distorting tax rates is raised
or the government consumption-output ratio is lowered to maintain fiscal solvency.
As for qT , because the model is calibrated to include transfers (instead of lump-sum
taxes) in steady state, future transfers as a share of output must be lowered when the
debt-output ratio rises. To isolate the impacts of alternative financing schemes, only
one of the four fiscal rules is operative in each experiment. That is, in each policy
experiment, only one of the four fiscal adjustment parameters is non-zero, as shown
in table 1.
Policy choices must satisfy rules (1)-(4) and the government’s budget constraint at
each date:
Bt = Gt + Rt−1 Bt−1 − τ Lt Wt Lt − τ K
t rt Kt−1 + Tt .

3.3. The solution method. Following King, Plosser, and Rebelo (1988), the model,
which has a deterministic growth trend h, is scaled by the factor of ht . This creates a
new discount factor, β ∗ ≡ βh1−γ , such that the steady state of the economy has constant output growth and consumption, and investment are constant shares of output.
An analytical solution is not available; the equilibrium conditions are log-linearized
around the original steady state and analyzed in terms of percentage deviations from
the economy’s steady state growth path. The model is solved using Sims’s (2001)
algorithm.
We examine permanent tax cuts. The use of log-linearization may raise concerns
about the quality of the first-order approximation when the equilibrium is away from
the original steady state. Such concerns are alleviated by the facts that the equilibrium system for the model is nearly log-linear and that the size of tax cuts considered
here is fairly small (a reduction of 1 percent of tax rates from their original steady
state levels). To check the quality of the approximation, we compare consumption,
investment, labor, and output in the new steady state (the steady state to which the
economy evolves after a permanent 1 percent cut in tax rates) solved by two methods:
one uses approximated log-linear equilibrium system and the other uses the non-linear
equilibrium equations. The second method, solved numerically, yields accurate results
for the new steady state. The comparison shows that the approximation errors for
the four variables using the log-linearized system are all within 0.035 percent of their
new steady state values.
3.4. The equilibrium. The unique competitive equilibrium consists of agents’ deci∞

variables {Bt , Gt , τ Lt , τ K
t , Tt } such that, given initial levels of capital and debt, K−1
and B−1 , in each period the optimality conditions for agents’ and firms’ problems are
satisfied; the goods, capital, labor, and bond markets clear; the transversality conditions for capital and debt hold; the government budget constraint and the policy
rules (equations (1)-(4)) are satisfied.
Existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium depend crucially on the size of the fiscal
adjustment parameters. Only certain ranges of these coeﬃcients ensure that expected
government debt does not grow faster than the economy, so the transversality cont+T
dition for debt, Et limT →∞ β t+T −1 u0 (ct+T ) hBt+T
+1 = 0, is satisfied. In general, when a
future fiscal variable is under- or over-adjusted (the absolute value of the corresponding non-zero q is either too small or too large), an equilibrium fails to exist. It is easy
to see why under-adjustment does not produce an equilibrium: government expenses
are not reduced or receipts do not grow suﬃciently to rein in the speed of debt growth
relative to output. When future policy is over-adjusted, the reasons an equilibrium
fails to exist vary, depending on which fiscal variable responds to the debt. If the
government spending share or one of the two tax rates responds, then lowering the
spending share or raising a tax rate too much could slow down output more than the
reduction in debt, and the debt-output ratio still rises and fails to converge to a constant level. If the transfer share responds, reducing this share too much can produce
negative government debt ¡(government
lends to the private sector). Policy rule (3)

becomes meaningless as ln st /s is undefined when sB
t /s < 0. The analysis here
focuses on the ranges of the non-zero q’s that yield a unique equilibrium.4
3.5. Model calibration. The model is calibrated at an annual frequency. Table 2
reports the benchmark values of parameters and some steady state variables before
a permanent tax rate change. The choice of the structural parameters is comparable
to those in similar models with distorting capital and labor income taxation [Braun
(1994), McGrattan (1994), Jones (2002), and Yang (2005)]. The model implies that in
the original steady state, the fraction of time spent working is 0.20, the consumptionoutput ratio is 0.63, the investment-output ratio is 0.17, and the debt-output ratio is
about 0.4. Each q value represents how aggressively the specified policy responds to
government debt. For example, if the transfer share is adjusted, under the benchmark
parameter setting, qT = −0.4 and qG = qK = qL = 0. The benchmark settings of
q’s are chosen so that the adjustment of future fiscal variables is as gradual as it can
be to maintain a sustainable budget, while ensuring the economy evolves to a new
steady state after about 100 years.5
4Our

rationale for restricting attention to equilibria with non-negative government debt is that
in practice governments are rarely net lenders to the private sector.

4. Dynamic Impacts of Permanent Tax Rate Cuts
This section reports the dynamic impacts of permanent reductions in capital and
labor tax rates and shows how those impacts change when the financing schemes vary
among permanently higher lump-sum taxes, a lower government consumption-output
ratio, and increases in other proportional tax rates.
4.1. Tax-rate cuts financed by lump-sum taxes. To show that the government
financing rule is an important determinant of the growth eﬀects of permanent tax
cuts, first we examine the consequences of tax rate cuts financed by lump-sum taxes.
The policy rule for the transfer-output share, (3), is operative, with qT = −0.4, so
debt-financed deficits reduce expected future transfers (raise lump-sum taxes). Figure
1 reports the responses to a permanent 1 percent cut in the capital or labor tax rate,
financed by sales of government debt under the parameter values in table 2.6 The
solid lines are the responses to a capital tax rate cut, and the dashed-dotted lines are
those for a labor tax rate cut.
Both cuts in capital and labor taxes generate growth, with higher investment and
hours worked along the transition path. In the short run, substitution eﬀects created
by lower capital and labor tax rates entice agents to invest more and work harder,
raising output. As the economy converges to the new steady state, wealth eﬀects
from higher disposable income raise consumption and leisure; investment and hours
worked subside somewhat, but remain above their original steady state levels. While
the model used here is discrete and stochastic and the one in Mankiw and Weinzierl
(forthcoming) is continuous and deterministic, the qualitative patterns for permanent
capital or labor tax cuts are the same across the two models. Revenues from capital
and labor income taxes are permanently lower (bottom right panel) and the shortfall
is absorbed by permanently higher lump-sum taxes (bottom left panel).
When the government has access to a non-distorting tax instrument, lower tax
rates appear to be powerful stimulants to growth. We now consider the growth eﬀects
when policy must adjust government consumption or distorting taxes to ensure fiscal
sustainability.
4.2. Alternative financing schemes. We consider the consequences of permanent
reductions in capital (or labor) tax rates, which are financed initially by government
5Section

Mankiw and Weinzierl (forthcoming) finance these tax-rate reductions with contemporaneous lump-sum taxes, rather than debt, Ricardian equivalence ensures the two exercises produces
identical results in this model.

debt and eventually by permanent reductions in government consumption or permanent increases in labor (or capital) tax rates. Figure 2 plots the dynamic responses
of macroeconomic variables to a permanent, unexpected 1 percent cut in the capital tax rate at time 0. Dashed-dotted lines are the impacts with qG = −0.2 and
qT = qK = qL = 0; solid lines are the impacts with qL = 0.2 and qG = qT = qK = 0;
for reference, we repeat the responses from figure 1, which are dashed lines obtained
when qT = −0.4 and qG = qK = qL = 0.7
When the capital tax rate is permanently cut, it increases the expected rate of
return to investment. Regardless of which policy rule is used, agents sacrifice consumption in order to invest more in the first few years; consumption initially falls
below the level in the original steady state path. Lower consumption raises the marginal utility of consumption, raising the marginal benefit of working and the supply of
labor. Higher labor and higher capital stock produce more output. After a few years,
the wealth eﬀects of higher income raise consumption and keep investment above its
original steady state path.
On the government financing side, the capital tax rate cut drives up the government
debt-output ratio. When lump-sum taxes rise with debt, the tax reduction has its
largest positive eﬀects on investment, hours, and output (dashed lines). This outcome
is not surprising, as a distorting source of tax revenues is replaced by a non-distorting
source.
Alternative financing schemes, however, involve changing some other distortion,
with important implications for the impacts of tax changes. Reductions in the government consumption-output ratio (dotted-dashed lines) raise wealth as the government absorbs a smaller share of output. Wealthier households consume more leisure,
reducing hours worked both along the transition path and in the new steady state.
In the long run, the reduction in the government consumption ratio crowds in private
consumption, raising consumption above its original steady state level. Ultimately, a
higher after-tax return on investment raises the steady state capital stock and output,
though by less than when lump-sum taxes adjust to clear the government budget.
When the labor income tax rate rises to compensate for the lower capital tax rate,
the permanently lower after-tax return to labor reduces hours worked in the new
steady state. After rising initially, output declines back to its original steady state
level. Permanently higher investment, coupled with a fixed government consumptionoutput ratio, implies that consumption is lower in the new steady state.

7We

do not allow a tax rate to adjust in response to its own shock. This simply allows the tax
rate being shocked to be permanently held at 1 percent below its original steady state level.

DYNAMIC SCORING: ALTERNATIVE FINANCING SCHEMES

10

The bottom right panel of the figure shows that total revenues derived from capital and labor income taxes are permanently lower when government consumption
or lump-sum taxes adjust, while revenues rise when labor tax rates adjust. The
permanently higher revenues following a capital tax cut arise from higher future labor tax rates. It would be misleading to infer that capital tax cuts per se generate
permanently higher revenues.
Analogous, but diﬀerent, patterns of results emerge when a permanent labor tax
rate reduction is financed by three alternative schemes. Figure 3 reports responses
to a 1 percent labor tax rate cut. Dashed-dotted lines and dashed lines report eﬀects
when government consumption and lump-sum taxes adjust using the same parameter
settings that underlie figure 2. Solid lines give the responses when capital taxes adjust
with qK = 0.3 and qT = qG = qL = 0.
Once again, the tax impacts on investment, hours worked, and output are largest
when lump-sum taxes respond to debt to satisfy the government budget constraint.
Permanently lower labor tax rates raise the return to labor and increase equilibrium
hours and output for the first few years. The deficit-financed tax cut raises debt as a
share of output.
When future government consumption is reduced in response to the rising debt, the
positive wealth eﬀect oﬀsets the substitution eﬀect induced by a higher after-tax real
wage, and within 15 years of the tax cut, hours worked fall as the economy converges
to a new steady state with lower employment, output, and investment. This negative
long-run growth outcome is strikingly diﬀerent from the case when lump-sum transfers
are used to respond to higher debt. As before, the reduced steady state government
share crowds in private consumption.
If higher debt raises expected capital taxes, the long-run negative growth eﬀects
are still more pronounced. Lower expected returns to investment sharply reduce
investment, output, and consumption.8 After an initial increase, hours worked return
rapidly to their original steady state level. When capital taxes are expected to adjust
to balance the budget, a permanent cut in labor taxes produces only an ephemeral
increase in growth; in the long run, growth can fall.
Fiscal adjustments operating through government consumption or one of the two
distorting income taxes can generate permanent changes in important macroeconomic
variables. This result is an outgrowth of the permanent increase in the debt-output
ratio induced by the permanent tax cuts. A higher level of government indebtedness
carries with higher debt service, which requires permanent fiscal adjustments to ensure
the government is solvent.
8Similar

results appear in Gordon and Leeper’s (2005) study of countercyclical fiscal policies.

5. Debt-Output Ratio and Growth Effects of Tax Cuts
We have shown, perhaps not surprisingly, that the dynamic impacts of tax-rate
reductions hinge critically on assumptions about which fiscal instruments adjust to
satisfy the government’s budget constraint intertemporally. What might be surprising
is that even in a bare-bones neoclassical growth model, the speed of fiscal adjustment
can matter.
Figures 4 and 5 reproduce the exercises in figures 2 and 3 under a variety of settings
of the fiscal adjustment parameters (the q’s). Those parameters take values that imply
the adjustment ranges from gradual, as in figures 2 and 3, to aggressive. Figure 4
shows results for a permanent capital tax rate cut. In the first column, government
consumption adjusts, with qG = −0.2 (dotted-dashed line), qG = −0.3 (dashed line),
and qG = −0.9 (solid line). Column two varies the response of transfers to debt, with
qT = −0.3 (dotted-dashed), qT = −0.5 (dashed), and qT = −1.5 (solid). In the last
column, the labor tax rate adjusts with settings of qL = 0.15 (dotted-dashed), qL = 0.3
(dashed), and qL = 0.8 (solid). Figure 5 reports responses to a permanent labor tax
rate cut. Columns one and two are generated under the same fiscal adjustment
parameters as in figure 4; in the third column, the capital tax rate adjusts at speeds
given by qK = 0.2 (dotted-dashed), qK = 0.6 (dashed), and qK = 2 (solid). The choice
of settings for the q’s is somewhat arbitrary; they roughly cover the range of q’s that
yield a unique equilibrium. Diﬀerent q values yield diﬀerent quantitative results, but
the qualitative patterns are covered by the values considered.
Several observations emerge from these figures. First, the aggressiveness of fiscal
policy’s response to debt matters a great deal for long-run growth eﬀects (except,
of course, when the transfer share adjusts). Second, the stronger the response to
debt, the smaller the debt-output ratio in the new steady state, and the stronger the
long-run growth eﬀects of a tax cut (except when transfers adjust). For example,
in response to a labor tax rate cut, when the government consumption ratio is the
oﬀsetting policy, the growth eﬀects remain positive in the new steady state when
qG = −0.9. With qG = −0.3, in contrast, the tax cut has essentially no growth
eﬀects, while qG = −0.2 produces negative growth (column 1 of figure 5). In the
case when capital taxes adjust to a labor tax rate cut, although long-run growth is
negative under the three qK ’s examined, the larger the qK , the smaller the reduction
in growth.
These figures put a sharp point on an earlier observation. The more rapidly policy
adjusts to a tax cut, the less debt accumulates, and the lower is the required debt
service. The level of debt service in the new steady state is an important determinant
of long-run growth when debt must be serviced by a distorting fiscal instrument.

The systematic relationship between the speed of fiscal adjustment to debt and
long-run growth outcomes has important policy implications. Not only does tax policy
influence long-run growth, but debt management policy also matters. A relatively
small response in the short run when the budget starts deteriorating can be more
costly in terms of growth in the long run.
6. Revenue Effects of Tax Cuts
A major concern of fiscal authorities is how the growth eﬀects of tax policies aﬀect
the revenue estimates of tax proposals. A tax proposal estimated to have smaller
revenue loss is more likely to be adopted than one with bigger losses. Under the
presumption that tax cuts generate growth, revenue estimation by either static scoring
or the methods conventionally used by government agencies overlooks the growth
eﬀects of tax cuts, and hence overstates their associated revenue losses.
Mankiw and Weinzierl’s (forthcoming) calculation in a model without debt supports
this claim. Under their benchmark parameter values, they find that growth pays for
53 percent of the static revenue loss in the new steady state for a capital tax rate
cut, and 17 percent for a labor tax cut. Also, the revenue loss for either tax cut is
smaller than the static revenue loss in each period along the transition path. This
result is expected, as tax cuts financed by reducing lump-sum transfers generate
higher output both on the transition path and in the new steady state. Table 3
calculates the percentage of static revenue eﬀects oﬀset by higher growth at various
points in time using the setup where lump-sum transfers adjust to clear the budget.
Tax revenue is defined as the sum of capital and labor taxes and does not include
lump-sum taxes. Static revenue eﬀects are computed holding the tax base at its
original steady state path (as if the tax cuts have no impact on tax bases). Under our
benchmark parameter values, 95.2 percent and 47.2 percent of static revenue losses
are oﬀset by higher growth in the new steady state. As Mankiw and Weinzierl find,
static scoring always overstates the revenue loss for tax cuts financed by lump-sum
taxes or transfers.
Because the large revenue responses are driven by positive output reactions throughout the transition path, it is not diﬃcult to see that if output turns negative, as it
does when government consumption or capital taxes adjust to a permanent cut in the
labor tax rate, static scoring can understate or overstate revenue losses. For example,
when the future government consumption ratio is reduced in response to rising debt,
under the benchmark parameter values, static scoring understates the revenue loss of
a labor tax rate cut in the new steady state. Table 4 reports percentages of static
revenue losses oﬀset by higher growth when tax cuts are financed by reductions in

the government consumption ratio. For a capital tax rate cut, 34.9 percent of static
revenue loss is oﬀset by higher growth in the new steady state. In the case of a labor
tax rate cut, the revenue loss under dynamic scoring is 13 percent above the loss
under static scoring in the new steady state. In other words, the conclusion that
static revenue estimates always overstate the revenue loss of a tax cut, as Mankiw
and Weinzierl (forthcoming) argue, may not hold when taxes are financed by schemes
other than lump-sum transfers.
Diﬀerences between the dynamic scores we report in table 3 and Mankiw and
Weinzierl’s results stem from diﬀerences in model calibrations. The diﬀerences can be
reconciled by changing three aspects of our calibration: reduce the steady state capital
tax rate from .35 to .25; increase the steady state percentage of time spent working
from 20 percent to 34 percent; reduce the intertemporal elasticity of substitution of
leisure from 1 to .5. Under the alternative calibration, the degree to which permanent
tax reductions are self-financing is much closer to Mankiw and Weinzierl’s numbers:
66.8 percent for capital taxes and 25.3 percent for labor taxes in the new steady state.
We do not wish to argue that one set of numbers is more plausible than another.
Our point is that the numbers are sensitive both to model calibration, as Mankiw
and Weinzierl acknowledge, and to assumptions about how future policy responds to
debt-financed tax cuts.
7. Concluding Remarks
Mankiw and Weinzierl (forthcoming) provide a provocative answer to the pressing
policy issue of whether conventional theory is consistent with the popular view that
tax cuts can be self-financing. Their optimistic conclusion is that, although not
fully self-financing, permanent reductions in capital and labor taxes can stimulate
economic growth and expand the tax base enough to oﬀset sizeable fractions of the
revenue losses. The thought experiment underlying this sanguine conclusion involves
replacing a distorting tax with a non-distorting tax.
To be sure, Mankiw and Weinzierl have isolated one mechanism at work following
tax changes. But implementing their thought experiment may be diﬃcult in practice,
as it entails reducing politically sensitive transfer programs to balance the government’s budget intertemporally. In practice, reduction in one source of distortion may
be associated with change in some other distortion. This paper has examined two
other distortions–government consumption and an alternative tax rate–to find that
Mankiw and Weinzierl’s conclusions about the growth eﬀects of tax reductions hinge
on the particular thought experiment they conduct. Very diﬀerent results emerge
when other distortions adjust.

The paper has also shown that how aggressively policies adjust to increases in government debt can matter for the long-run growth eﬀects of tax reductions. Postponing
adjustment or very gradual adjustment can take the economy to a new steady state
with higher debt. When that debt is serviced with a distorting fiscal instrument, the
beneficial growth eﬀects of tax reductions can be partially or completely reversed.
