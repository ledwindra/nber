The Social Security Windfall Elimination and Government Pension Offset Provisions for Public
Employees in the Health and Retirement Study

NBER Working Paper No. 19724
December 2013

ABSTRACT
This paper uses data from the Health and Retirement Study to investigate the effects of Social Security’s
Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO) provision on Social
Security benefits received by individuals and households. WEP reduces the benefits of individuals
who worked in jobs covered by Social Security and also worked in uncovered jobs where a pension
was earned. WEP also reduces spouse benefits. GPO reduces spouse and survivor benefits for persons
who worked in uncovered government employment where they also earned a pension.
Unlike previous studies, we take explicit account of pensions earned on jobs not covered by Social
Security, a key determinant of the size of WEP and GPO adjustments. Also unlike previous studies,
we focus on the household. This allows us to incorporate the full effects of WEP and GPO on spouse
and survivor benefits, and to evaluate the effects of WEP and GPO on the assets accumulated by affected
families.
Among our findings: About 3.5 percent of households are subject to either WEP or to GPO. The present
value of their Social Security benefits is reduced by roughly one fifth. This amounts to five to six percent
of the total wealth they accumulate before retirement. Households affected by both WEP and GPO
lose about one third of their benefit. Limiting the reduction in the Social Security benefit to half the
size of the pension from uncovered employment reduces the penalty from WEP for members of the
original HRS cohort by about 60 percent.

The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), enacted in 1983, reduces Social Security
payments to entitled beneficiaries who also worked in and earned a pension in uncovered
employment. To be affected by WEP, an individual must have been employed in a job covered
by Social Security for long enough to qualify for benefits; must have also worked on a job not
covered by Social Security, where FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) taxes were not
paid; and importantly, must have earned a pension on that uncovered job.
To understand how the Windfall Elimination Provision works, one must have a basic
understanding of how Social Security benefits are determined. Benefits are based on a person’s
highest 35 years of covered earnings. Previous earnings are indexed up to the year the individual
turns age 60. Earnings after age 60 are not indexed. The higher are indexed covered earnings,
measured by Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME), the higher is the basic benefit a
person is entitled to at full retirement age, called the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA). The
Social Security benefit formula is designed to be progressive, replacing a decreasing share of
earnings as earnings increase. In 2013, the PIA replaced 90 percent of the first $9,492 of indexed
annual earnings; 32 percent of indexed earnings between $9,492 and $57,216, and 15 percent of
indexed earnings over that amount. (To facilitate later analysis, we specify earnings on an annual
basis. Social Security formulas are typically specified using monthly amounts.) The actual Social
Security benefit paid also depends on when benefits are claimed. If the benefit is claimed before
the full retirement age, it is reduced below the PIA. If claimed after the full retirement age, the
benefit payment is increased above the PIA.
WEP reduces Social Security benefits by lowering the replacement rate for Average
Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) up to the first bend point from 90 percent to a minimum of
40 percent. The benefit reduction from WEP is limited to half the value of the pension from
uncovered work. So for WEP to have a substantial effect, the pension from uncovered
employment must be large relative to the earned Social Security benefit. When a worker’s
benefits are reduced by WEP, so are associated spouse benefits, but not survivor benefits.1

1

For further discussion of WEP, see Social Security Administration (2012a). Brown and Weisbenner
(2013) carefully and thoroughly analyze the incentives created by the WEP formula itself. They do not, however,
examine the implications of limiting the WEP adjustment to half the value of the pension from uncovered
employment.

Congress enacted WEP to eliminate what they perceived to be an unintended windfall
(GAO, 2007, p. 6). Before WEP, because Social Security benefits are based on a progressive
formula designed to replace a higher fraction of earnings for those with low lifetime earnings,
years spent in employment on an uncovered job were treated as years of zero earnings. As a
result, some individuals who received relatively high annual earnings throughout their lifetime,
in some years from covered employment and in others from uncovered employment, were
treated in the calculation of AIME as if they were low earners.2
Most, but not all uncovered workers are government employees, although most
government employees are covered by Social Security.3 “According to the Social Security
Administration (SSA), as of December 2012, about 1.5 million Social Security beneficiaries
were affected by the WEP.”(Congressional Research Service, 2013a, p. 3).4
A related program, the Government Pension Offset (GPO), reduces Social Security
benefits paid to spouses or survivors when the recipient of the spouse or survivor benefit also
earned a pension from working on a government job that was not covered by Social Security.
The reduction is equal to two-thirds of the government pension from uncovered work. (Social
Security Administration, 2012b). “In December 2011, about 568,000 Social Security
beneficiaries (about 1% of all Social Security beneficiaries) had spousal benefits reduced by the
GPO (this figure does not include persons who were eligible for spousal benefits but were
deterred from filing for them because of GPO.” (Congressional Research Service, 2013, p. 3).
Notice that GPO applies to government workers, while WEP applies to those who worked in any
uncovered employment.5

There is a similar problem in the case of immigrants, but policy has not been changed to address the
problem. Gustman and Steinmeier (2000) show that immigrants who spend fewer years in covered employment than
U.S. born enjoy a higher rate of return on their payroll taxes paid than do U.S. born with comparable annual
earnings. Indeed, immigrants with high annual earnings, but only a decade or so of covered employment, enjoy up to
a ninety percent replacement rate on the FICA taxes they pay, despite having similar annual earnings and wealth as
native born. Gustman and Steinmeier also discuss a simple policy fix for this problem.

According to data cited in Brown and Weisbenner, "Approximately one fourth of all public employees in
the U.S. do not pay Social Security taxes on the earnings from their government job (U.S. GAO, 2007). This
includes approximately 5.25 million state and local workers, as well as approximately 1 million federal employees
hired before 1984 (U.S. GAO, 2003)."
4
According to the GAO: “About 2.4% of all Social Security beneficiaries (including disabled and spouse
beneficiaries), and about 4% of all retired worker beneficiaries, were affected by the WEP in December 2012.”
(Congressional Research Service, 2013a, p. 3)

We show below that respondents have difficulty in determining whether they work for the government or
not. Consequently, we apply the GPO adjustment whenever the job is reported as not covered by Social Security.

In the absence of the Government Pension Offset, a spouse or survivor of a covered
worker, where the spouse worked in uncovered government employment, would be treated more
favorably than the spouse of a covered worker, where that spouse worked only in covered
employment (Diamond and Orszag, 2003). The reason is that when both spouses have covered
earnings, dual entitlement provisions apply. Under dual entitlement, the total benefits paid to a
spouse who is entitled both to benefits based on own covered work and to spouse benefits will be
the higher of the two benefits. That is, where spouse benefits (roughly half the benefit of the
primary earner) are greater than benefits from own work, the spouse benefit “tops up” the benefit
from own work. Similarly, the total paid to a survivor is the greater of benefits to be received as
a survivor (the benefit of the primary earner) or the benefit based on the survivor’s own covered
work. Again the survivor benefit is paid as a “top up” over own benefits. In contrast, consider the
situation of a spouse who earned a pension from a lifetime of uncovered work. In the absence of
GPO, the uncovered worker would be eligible for the full Social Security spouse or survivor
benefit from their covered spouse’s employment. (Social Security Administration, 2012)6
Empirical studies of WEP and GPO have been conducted by government agencies, such
as SSA, GAO and the Congressional Research Service. These studies are based on
administrative data. Typically, they report the number of individuals affected by WEP and GPO
and the dollar values of these offsets for each individual. However, administrative data have not
been used to analyze the impact of WEP and GPO at the household level. Without household
level data, it is not possible to analyze the interactions of WEP and GPO. Nor is it possible to
evaluate WEP and GPO adjustments in relation to household pensions and total wealth
accumulated around retirement age.
This paper uses data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to estimate the effects
of WEP and GPO at the household level. Our analysis uses respondent provided work histories
6

There is another type of inequity that the Government Pension Offset creates. Consider households with
three different types of earnings records. In household 1, in line with the traditional model of a family in vogue
when Social Security was first adopted, all work is undertaken by a primary earner in the private sector in covered
employment. By design of the system, with some minor adjustments, a spouse who never worked is entitled to half
the benefit paid the primary earner in the household, and to the full benefit should the primary earner die. In
household 2, one spouse works in uncovered employment and earns a pension, while the other works in covered
employment. The member of the couple from household 2 who works in uncovered employment and earns a
pension may lose spouse and survivor benefits due to the Government Pension Offset. This would appear to be
unfair relative to household 1, where only one spouse works. Neither of the spouses with no covered earnings paid
any payroll taxes, but household 2, where one spouse worked in government employment and earned a pension, will
receive a much smaller spouse or survivor benefit, if any, than the spouse in household 1, who did not work at all.

and administrative earning records to estimate the covered and uncovered earnings histories of
each spouse, evaluates pensions from any uncovered jobs, imputes missing data, and then uses
the Social Security Administration’s ANYPIA program to estimate benefits before and after the
WEP and GPO provisions are applied. HRS allows us to relate WEP and GPO adjustments that
are called for under current law to the values of their Social Security and pensions from covered
and uncovered employment, and to relate these adjustments, as well as the total benefits from
Social Security and pensions, to the total wealth accumulated by households on the verge of
retiring.
Before turning to our analysis, note two important caveats. First, we are projecting WEP
and GPO adjustments on the basis of current law, reported covered and uncovered earnings, and
expected claiming dates, and reported pensions from uncovered work. We do not have direct
observations of WEP and GPO adjustments among a population that has already retired.7
Second, this paper analyzes the first round effects of these policies. We do not include behavioral
responses to WEP and GPO as affected respondents and members of their households react to
the incentives created by the policies.
Section II further discusses WEP and GPO. Section III discusses the variables needed to
estimate WEP and GPO adjustments with data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), and
the reasons for the mixed approach we take in using respondent and administrative data. Section
IV calculates the basic measures of employment, earnings and coverage required to determine
the incidence of WEP and GPO. Section V analyzes the effects of WEP and GPO on Social
Security benefits. Section VI disaggregates the effects of WEP into changes in benefits resulting
a) from the reduction in the generosity coefficient through the first bend point in the AIME
formula from 90 percent to as low as 40 percent; and b) from the effects of adjustments
associated with pensions earned in uncovered employment. Section VII concludes.

An SSA description of one particular type of administrative data file, one that reports the information
from the W2 form, notes: “With EPUF, it is also not possible to adjust benefits for workers subject to the Windfall
Elimination Provision, which reduces benefits of individuals who have only minimal Social Security coverage and
will receive a pension based on years of work in non-covered employment" (SSA, 2012). Compson (2011, footnote
25) indicates “SSA cannot determine married-couple or parent-child relationships in the file based on the
information derived from the MEF. SSA establishes such linkages after an individual applies for benefits. In any
event, linking currently or previously married individuals or indicating a familial relationship in EPUF would create
serious data disclosure risks.”

II. Further Discussion of WEP and GPO
WEP and GPO Interactions at the Household Level
To set the stage for the calculation of the actual WEP and GPO adjustments found in data
from the Health and Retirement Study, Table 1 presents twelve scenarios. For each scenario,
Table 1A indicates own benefits of the wife in couple households, or of a single woman in a one
person household, the spouse benefits received by the wife, and the survivor benefits received by
the wife. The table shows own, spouse and survivor benefits for the woman under various
combinations of previous employment by the husband and wife. Table 1B keeps the
combinations of work by the husband and wife the same. It indicates own benefits of the
husband, the spouse benefits that may accrue to some husbands based on their wife’s
employment, and the survivor benefits accruing to some husbands.
The scenarios are listed in columns 1 and 2 of the table. Scenarios involve different
combinations of employment in the public and private sectors, as well as nonemployment. Each
spouse may have worked long enough in a job covered by Social Security to be entitled to
benefits, worked in a job not covered by Social Security, and/or earned a pension in a job not
covered by Social Security, or not worked long enough in any job to qualify for Social Security
benefits. Column 1 describes the work history of the male in the household; column 2 describes
the work history for the female, where in all but Scenario 11, the household includes a husband
and wife.
Column 3 in each table indicates whether WEP applies in determining own benefits.
Columns 4 and 5 report the top up over own benefits from spouse and survivor benefits. The “top
up” is the additional benefit paid under dual entitlement beyond the “own benefit” earned by the
indicated individual. The top up will be paid on the basis of the each spouse’s earnings and
pension history.

* Total spouse or survivor benefit equals own benefit plus top-up. The WEP adjustment uses a replacement rate as low as 40 percent (depending on the number
of years of covered work) up to the first bend point when calculating Social Security benefits instead of the 90 percent replacement rate called for by the PIA
formula. The WEP adjustment to Social Security benefits cannot exceed half of the pension earned in uncovered employment. GPO reduces Social Security
spouse and survivor benefits up to 2/3 of the value of pensions from own uncovered employment.

* Total spouse or survivor benefit equals own benefit plus top-up. The WEP adjustment uses a 40 percent replacement rate up to the first bend point when
calculating Social Security benefits instead of the 90 percent replacement rate called for by the PIA formula. The WEP adjustment to Social Security benefits cannot
exceed half of the pension earned in uncovered employment. GPO reduces Social Security spouse and survivor benefits up to 2/3 of the value of pensions from own
uncovered employment.

For example, in Scenario 1, the husband worked in an uncovered job with a
pension and also gained entitlement to Social Security benefits from covered
employment. The wife had no substantial earnings history either in a covered or an
uncovered job. (Scenario 7 flips the employment of each spouse so that the wife worked
in an uncovered job with a pension, and also gained entitlement to Social Security, while
the husband had no substantial earnings.) Thus in Table 1A, Scenario 1, the wife had no
own benefits. From Table 1B, the husband’s own benefits are adjusted by WEP. From
Table 1A, the top up for the wife is equal to the full spouse benefit based on her
husband’s work after adjusting for WEP; and the top up to the survivor benefit is equal to
the full value of her survivor benefit based on her husband’s work, not adjusted for WEP.
Analogous results are shown for Scenario 7.
To take a more complicated example, in Scenario 6, both the husband and wife
worked in an uncovered job with a pension, and also gained entitlement to Social
Security benefits from covered employment. For each spouse, own benefits are first
adjusted by WEP. For the wife, the top up to the spouse benefit based on her husband’s
work in covered employment starts with half his benefit after WEP, from which her own
benefits are subtracted, with two thirds of the pension from her own uncovered work then
subtracted from the remainder. The top up in her survivor benefits starts with her
husband’s full benefit not adjusted for WEP, less her own benefits, with two thirds of her
pension from her own uncovered work subtracted from the remainder. The analogous
calculation is used to determine any top up to the husband’s own benefit after WEP due
to the spouse and survivor benefit from the wife’s covered earnings.
Pensions from Uncovered Work Limit WEP and GPO Adjustments
Congress did not go as far as it might have in setting the WEP and GPO limitations on
Social Security benefits. With regard to WEP, Congress recognized that because of the
progressivity of the benefit formula, those who spend part of their career in uncovered work
receive a proportionately better deal from Social Security. Nevertheless, Congress was unwilling
to mechanically reduce basic Social Security benefits just because a person had also worked in
uncovered employment.8 That is, Social Security benefits are not reduced simply because a

8

A part of the reason had to do with difficulties of measuring the value of earning from uncovered
employment. Brown and Weisbenner (2012, p. 6) point out that the Social Security Administration did not collect

10

person who worked in uncovered employment consequently receives a higher ratio of Social
Security benefits to Social Security taxes paid. The potentially affected individual must also have
earned a pension from uncovered work for benefits to be reduced under WEP. Then the benefit
reduction is limited to half the value of the pension from uncovered work. We will show below
that limiting the WEP adjustment to half the value of a public pension earned reduces the WEP
offset by more than half.
Nor would Congress augment the GPO adjustment to reduce spouse or survivor benefits
simply because a spouse of an entitled worker had spent a significant amount of time in an
uncovered job. Once again, the adjustment is made only if the individual also earned a pension
from working in uncovered employment.
In sum, Congress drew the line at what it perceived to be “double dipping”. If, in addition
to working long enough on a covered job to become eligible for Social Security benefits, a
person worked in uncovered employment, and that person also received a pension from their
uncovered job, the individual’s Social Security benefits, and benefits to be paid to the spouse or
survivor of that individual, would be adjusted downward.9 Otherwise, there would be no
adjustment. Similarly, spouse and survivor benefits are adjusted downward for those whose own
work was in a job not covered by Social Security. Once again, however, spouse and survivor
benefits are reduced only if that individual also earned a pension from uncovered employment.
Opposition to WEP and GPO Continues
Congress’ decision not to reduce the Social Security benefits of those who worked in
uncovered employment, individuals who avoided payroll taxes, but did not receive a pension
from their uncovered work, did not eliminate opposition to WEP and GPO. Many affected
government workers resent WEP and GPO adjustments to their Social Security benefits. State
and local and other government employee associations continue to lobby, asking Congress to
eliminate these adjustments to their Social Security benefits.
One reason for this resentment is that the reduction in Social Security benefits called for
by the WEP formula can be substantial, at least at the limit. In the case of WEP, in 2013 the
data on earnings from uncovered employment before 1978. As a result, SSA could not adjust benefits for
uncovered earnings in any year before then.
9
Congress tempers the reduction in benefits for those who, despite having worked in uncovered
employment, worked for many years in covered employment. The penalty from WEP is reduced if the individual
worked in covered employment for more than twenty years, with the entire penalty eliminated if the individual
was covered by Social Security for at least thirty years. For those with between 20 and 30 years in covered
employment, the Social Security benefit is reduced on a prorated basis.

11

Social Security benefit is reduced by lowering the replacement rate for the first $9,492 of
covered earnings from 90 percent to (as low as) 40 percent. This adjustment reduces the
associated benefit from $8,543 per year to $3,797 per year, or by up to $4,746 per year. (For a
reduction of this size to be imposed through WEP, the pension from uncovered work would have
to be twice as large, or $9,492.) Under GPO, the reduction may be up to two thirds of the value
of the pension in uncovered work, and may wipe out the spouse or survivor benefit entirely. In
the case of the survivor benefit, that may entail a loss in the tens of thousands of dollars for a
surviving spouse who spent a full lifetime in uncovered employment (e.g., a public school
teacher).
III. The Data
Our analysis is based on data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). In its first
wave the HRS interviewed 12,652 respondents from households with at least one member
between the ages of 51 and 61 in 1992. Respondents have been interviewed every other year
since. New cohorts were added in 1998 (Warbabies); 2004 (Early Boomers) and 2010 (Mid
Boomers), consisting of individuals from households with at least one person age 51 to 56 in the
base year for each new cohort. Our study focuses on the original HRS cohort and on the Early
Boomers. Social Security earnings records are not available for the Mid Boomers at the time this
paper is being written. Thus the HRS cohort and the Early Boomer cohorts are the earliest and
latest cohorts that include the required data.
Employment history, coverage by Social Security and pension coverage are reported in
the respondent interview. During the baseline survey, respondents were asked about their current
job, last job if not currently employed, the most recent previous job lasting five or more years,
and two additional previous jobs lasting at least five years that offered a pension. In this first
interview, respondents were also asked whether they ever worked for the government at the state,
local or federal level. In the third wave for the original HRS cohort, they were asked about work
on a job that was not covered by Social Security. In 2004, all respondents were asked additional
questions on coverage by Social Security and in 2006 whether they worked for a federal, state or
local government. Information collected on the start and end dates of jobs allow us to match the
period of employment with the type of employer, coverage by Social Security, and coverage by a
pension.

Matched administrative records provided by The Social Security Administration report
covered earnings in each year of work. Most respondents gave permission for the HRS to obtain
their Social Security records, and additional permissions were obtained in subsequent waves both
to allow updating and to obtain records for respondents who at first denied permission.
In addition to records on covered earnings, W2 records are also available. They provide
information on covered and uncovered earnings dating from 1978. Box 1 of the W2 record
reports total earnings, while box 3 reports earnings covered by Social Security. Earnings from
self-employment and earnings from employment not covered by Social Security (non-FICA
earnings) are also reported. We have used these data together with self-reports to identify jobs
that were not covered by Social Security.10
Own Social Security benefits from working on a covered job are calculated by applying
the Social Security Administration’s ANYPIA program to the covered earning records for the
respondent. When records are not available from the Social Security Administration, we impute
them based on individual and job characteristics, including self-reported earnings. Once the
values of own benefits are calculated, the respondents are merged into households. Own, spouse
and survivor benefits are calculated at the household level. For households where there was
some work in both covered and uncovered employment, where at least on party was entitled to
Social Security benefits, and one or another had a pension from uncovered work, the WEP and
GPO adjustments for the household members are calculated.

10

There are some internal inconsistencies in a minority of W2 records. To highlight the nature of these
inconsistencies, we constructed a sample of respondents who, by 1992, had worked at least 10 years on their
current job (this restriction eliminates complications from job changing and holding of multiple jobs within the
year), and eliminated the self-employed. We then looked for anomalies within this sample. As a first puzzle, we
found in 4.3 percent of respondent-year observations total W2 earnings are positive, but covered earnings (box 3)
and non-FICA earnings are zero. A second puzzle, in 1.3 percent of observations, while covered earnings and/or
non-FICA earnings are positive, total earnings are reported as zero. Third, for those with no job change, there are
anomalous changes in covered and non-FICA earnings between waves.
We should also note that self-employment earnings are not consistently reported over the full period. In
particular, before 1993, self-employment earnings might be only partially reported. In 1993, the cap on payroll
subject to the Medicare tax was lifted. Before then, if a person had earnings as an employee, where the earning
were subject to the payroll tax, while also having self-employment income, self-employment income was only
reported until the sum of total earnings reached maximum covered earnings for determining Social Security
payroll tax payments. Thus a person with a relatively well paid job who also worked in self-employment might
not have the full self-employment income reported. Since employee earnings took precedence, for those with
taxable earnings at the maximum, earnings from self-employment would vary inversely with the level of
employee earnings. Fortunately, from the perspective of our study, the only values we require from the Social
Security records are reports on covered earnings, whether they are from employment or self-employment.

13

Recall that WEP adjustments are limited to half the value of pensions from uncovered
work, and GPO adjustments are limited to two thirds of the value of the dependent spouse’s
pension from uncovered work. Pension data are taken from respondent self-reports. Based on
HRS reports as to employer, we determine whether the pension is from covered or from
uncovered employment. Pension values are calculated for DB plans based on reported benefits at
expected retirement dates, monthly pensions if the plan was already in pay status, and IRA
accounts and monthly annuities that had been rolled over at termination. SSA provides a formula
for converting DC pensions and lump sum pension settlements into a flow. For pensions from
current jobs in the baseline period we used the pension values at termination if that job was
terminated after 1992 for the original HRS cohort and after 2004 for the Early Boomers.
Significant errors in reporting of government employment limit our ability to identify
government employees. More specifically, for reasons we discuss below, it will turn out that
only half of respondents who report they worked in a job not covered by Social Security will also
report they were government employees.11
IV. Employment, Earnings and Coverage by WEP and GPO
Throughout this paper, those affected by WEP are identified as the subpopulation who
worked in employment not covered by Social Security, who also worked in employment subject
to FICA taxes and earned enough to be covered by Social Security (ten years of covered
quarters), and who had a pension from their uncovered employment.
We use reported dates of employment or tenure to identify jobs, to determine whether or
not those jobs are covered by Social Security, and to associate pensions with particular jobs.
After calculating earnings from covered and uncovered work at the individual level, we
aggregate up to the household. Households are separated into those that are subject to WEP
provisions, to GPO provisions, to both sets of provisions, and those that are not. This requires
identifying households where one or both members worked in uncovered employment; using
both the longitudinal feature of the HRS as well as detailed reporting of work on more than one
job to identify those households where some work was also in covered employment and was
sufficient to generate Social Security benefits; and to determine in which households with both
covered and uncovered employment, the uncovered work also generated a pension.

11

Agricultural workers and railroad employees are not subject to Social Security. There are only a few
individuals with these occupations in our sample.

14

To provide a clearer picture of our procedures, consider the data in Table 3. The top panel
pertains to members of the 1992 HRS cohort, and the bottom panel to the Early Boomer cohort.
Upon entry into the survey, respondents were asked about their employment status. Column
reports the number who reported being employed either currently or in the past. Since these
respondents were followed after the initial wave, we add information on any new jobs held
subsequent to the initial interview. Rows 2 and 4 report the number of respondents in the HRS
cohort and in the Early Boomer cohort who reported ever being employed.
Given the central role played by pensions in WEP and GPO adjustments, rows 1 and 3
report the number in each cohort ever covered by a pension. At this stage we do not identify
pensions that were lost or cashed out upon leaving the job and distinguish them from pensions
that were live at the time Social Security benefits were determined.
Of respondents who were ever employees, 7,480/10,703 (2,241/2,906), or 69.9 (77.1)
percent reported having a pension on at least one of their jobs. As in Gustman, Steinmeier and
Tabatabai (2010), many more workers have ever been covered by a pension than is suggested by
coverage rates from surveys of the general population, or of employers, asking about coverage
on a current job only, where roughly half report pension coverage.
Column 2 then indicates the number who reported they were ever employed by a unit of
the state, county, local or federal government (questions H61 and H62 in Wave 1). Note that
there is considerable ambiguity in determining government employment, especially for
respondents. Thus some respondents may not report they are, or have been, state or local
government employees even though they participate in state or local pension plans. Notable
examples may include employees of state universities, libraries and other state or locally funded
services where the employee’s salary check is not directly paid by a state or local government
agency, or is not obviously funded by the government, such as police or fire.12 There may even
be ambiguity on the part of some elementary or secondary school teachers.

12

It is easy to see why some respondents may classify a job that is not directly for a state or local
government agency, but nevertheless involves working in a publically supported institution that is part of the state
retirement system, as not involving government employment, while correctly noting the job is not covered by
Social Security. Consider again a person who works for a state university and thus does not work directly for the
state. Tuition may be as important, or more important, as a source of revenue for the university than direct support
from the state. In such a case, it is not clear how a respondent should be classified with regard to government
employment, let alone how respondents themselves should classify whether they work for the government or not.

15

The reported dates of government employment are matched with the respondent’s
employment history to identify whether a particular job involved government employment. That
is, each respondent reports the dates for current, last or previous jobs, and also reports the dates
worked in various levels of government employment. We allow an error of plus or minus 3 years
on each end of the job report when declaring a job to be a match. A total of 2,168 (681)
respondents report ever having worked for a government, representing 20.3 (23.4) percent of the
10,703 (2,906) respondents who reported ever being employed.
Column 3 reports employment in jobs not covered by Social Security. In wave 3
respondents from the original HRS cohort were asked (question G164) about employment in any
job where Social Security (FICA) taxes were not paid. Once again, jobs not covered by Social
Security were matched with jobs held according to reported dates of employment. Among the
10,703 (2,906) respondents who reported ever being an employee, 895/10,703 (239/2,906), or
8.4 (8.2) percent reported ever holding a job that was not covered by Social Security.
As an intermediate step to help distinguish reported government employment from
reported uncovered employment, we construct column 6, which reports the number of
respondents who either indicated they were government employees, or who said they were not
covered by Social Security, or both. The total of government employees plus non-covered
employees, counting the overlap between these groups twice, is 3,063 = 2168 + 895 (920 = 681
+ 239). The total of employees who reported working in either government employment, or noncovered employment, counting overlaps only once is 2,649 (762). So the total number who both
worked for the government and were not covered by Social Security is 414 = 3,063 – 2,649 (158
= 920 – 762). This means that 481 = 895 – 414 (81 = 239 – 158), or 481/895 (81/239) or 53.7
(33.9) percent of the employees who reported having a job that was not covered by Social
Security, did not report working for the government. Analogously, 19.1 percent = 414/2,168
(23.2 percent = 158/681) of government workers reported not being covered by Social
Security.13 To the extent that government employment is understated, but work in jobs not
covered by Social Security is reported accurately, the ratio of uncovered employees to
government employees will be too high.

13

The GAO (2010) report that 73 percent of state and local government employees are covered by Social
Security is based on administrative data supplied by the Social Security Administration.

16

Next we consider pension coverage among the various groups. Our particular concern is
with those individuals who were covered by a pension on a job not covered by Social Security.
From row 2 (and 4) of Table 3, 7,480/10,703 = 69.9 percent (2,241/2,906 = 77.1 percent) of all
employed individuals ever had a pension, that is, had a pension on at least one job. Among those
reporting they worked in government employment, the ratio of pension covered to noncovered
workers is .882 = 1,914/2,168 (.891 = 607/681) . And among employees reporting they were not
covered by Social Security, 78.1 percent = 699/895 (80.8 percent = 193/239) reported having a
pension on their job. Of 2,649 (762) respondents who reported either being a government worker
or a noncovered employee, 84.4 percent = 2,235/2,649 (87.7 percent = 668/762) reported having
a pension in that employment.
W2 data report the number of employees with non-FICA earnings. Column 4 indicates
the numbers of respondents who, according to the W2 data, were employees on non-FICA jobs.
Column 5 sums columns 3 and 4, indicating the number of respondents who either self-reported
they held jobs that were not covered by FICA, or who has an attached report from the Social
Security Administration indicating they had held a job that was not covered by FICA.
Altogether, that provides a sample from the original HRS cohort of 1,064 (266) respondents who
ever held a job that was not covered by Social Security. Of those, 858 (218) had a pension.
One might also be concerned about errors introduced when matching jobs between the
first wave and the third wave of the HRS where we take information about the respondent’s
noncovered jobs. To address this concern, row 1 of Table 4 presents comparable data from 2006,
where respondents were asked about government employment and coverage by FICA in the
same wave of the HRS. Of 5,089 current employees, 23.4 percent (1,191/5,089) reported they
were government employees, and 23.2 percent (1,183/5,089) either self-reported or were
reported in their W2 as not covered by Social Security. Once again, however, there is only
limited overlap between those reporting being a government worker and those reporting they
were not covered by Social Security. Using the same methodology as above, 81.7 percent
(966/1,183) of employees who reported having a current job that was not covered by Social
Security did not report working for the government. The problem again seems to be too few
respondents identifying themselves as government employees. Of government workers, 18.2
percent (217/1,191) reported being not covered by Social Security.

We do not know if an R was government/non-covered at a job started after 1992. We know the answer
to that question only if s/he had the same job in 2004 where s/he was asked if the job is a FICA job or
in 2006 if s/he reported working for a federal or state government.

Row 2 of Table 4 limits the sample from row 1 to those with a pension who also reported
a positive value for the pension, narrowing the population in our search for those who are subject
to WEP. As expected, the share of employees who are government workers is higher among
those who had a pension on their current job (866/2698 = 32 percent vs. 23 percent in row 1).
Table 4 tells us two things. First, it strengthens the evidence that the very small overlap
between respondents who say they are government workers and those who say their job is not
covered by Social Security is the result of a failure of some respondents to recognize that they
are government employees. Second, by narrowing the population to those who worked in
government or non-covered current jobs and earned a pension on those jobs, we come closer to
the population subject to WEP and GPO.
Individuals and Households Subject to WEP and GPO
The next step is to isolate those individuals and households where a respondent worked in
a job covered by Social Security, worked in a job not covered by Social Security, whether in a
current job or in a job held in the past, and earned a pension on the uncovered job. Table 5
focuses on individuals who meet these qualifications, while Table 6 focuses on households.
We begin with the data in Table 5. Results are reported for the original HRS cohort, those
51 to 61 in 1992, and for the Early Boomers, those 51 to 56 in 2004. The HRS cohort is over four
times the size of the Early Boomers, so we will concentrate on those results while also noting the
results for the Early Boomers in parentheses.
The numbers in this table indicate the basic affected populations in this study. From row
1, column 2, 548 respondents from the original HRS cohort (and 127 from the Early Boomers)
reported they held a job not covered by Social Security, where they also were covered by a
pension. This group is potentially subject to GPO. Row 1, column 3 then isolates the respondents
subject to WEP by restricting the group to those who also earned Social Security benefits by also
working on a covered job. Of those with non-covered employment (either reported in the selfreport or found in the W2 data), who also have a pension from that job, 72 percent of the original
cohort members (397/548) and 69 percent of the Early Boomers (88/127) are entitled to Social
Security benefits. Turning to the importance of the affected population relative to all government
workers or to all employed, of 10,585 respondents in 1992, 26 percent worked in a government
or non-covered job, with a comparable percentage of Early Boomers (761/2,901) working in
government or non-covered jobs. From column 1, 1,105 members of the original HRS cohort

20

reported ever working in a non-covered job. Those subject to WEP constitute about 3.8 percent
of all former employees (397/10,585). The comparable figure for the Early Boomer cohort is 3.0
percent (88/2,901).
For data at the household level, we turn to Table 6. Once again, we begin with the 1992
cohort. Of 7,623 households, 292, or 3.8 percent are subject to either WEP or to GPO. The
comparable figure for the Early Boomer cohort is 3.5 percent (75/2,150). Forty eight percent
(141/292) of the households from the original HRS cohort subject to either WEP or GPO are
subject to both. The figure is 36 percent (27/75) for the Early Boomer cohort.
V. Effects of WEP and GPO on Social Security Benefits and in Relation to Wealth
Having examined the numbers of affected respondents and respondent households, we
now calculate the basic values of Social Security benefits with and without WEP and GPO
adjustments. These calculations follow the formulas presented in Table 1 for each of the
scenarios based on different work histories.
Social Security benefits from covered employment are calculated by taking the covered
earnings history and plugging that into ANYPIA, software provided by the Social Security
Administration. ANYPIA also asks for the expected date of claiming. For those who also worked
in uncovered employment, ANYPIA asks about the value of any pension earned. If no pension
was earned on the uncovered job, there is no adjustment due to WEP. If a pension was earned,
the WEP adjustment is calculated by the ANYPIA program, which limits the WEP adjustment to
half the value of the uncovered pension. The benefits paid to the spouse of a person who is
subject to WEP are reduced to half the WEP adjusted benefit of the primary earner, with further
adjustment for age of retirement. Survivor benefits are not adjusted for WEP. The GPO
adjustment is calculated by subtracting two thirds of the value of the pension from uncovered
work from the spouse or survivor benefits of the person who worked and earned a pension in
uncovered employment.

Pension plans are central to the WEP and GPO calculations. They are valued using
respondent reports of expected benefits for defined benefit plans, or of plan balances for those
with defined contribution plans. We then determine whether former public sector employees who
also earned Social Security benefits should have a WEP or GPO offset to those benefits. For
purposes of determining WEP and GPO offsets, pensions are valued on a monthly basis. Defined
benefit plan values are derived from respondent reports of expected monthly pension benefits,
monthly pension receipt if in pay status, monthly annuity, IRA balances from rolled over DB or
DC plans, and lump sum payouts. Defined contribution plan values are based on respondent
reports of account values, including rollovers and lump sums. A monthly benefit is computed for
DC plans and other balances using a table provided by the Social Security Administration. These
benefits also take account of the date that Social Security benefits are first received.
In sum, we use three different key dates: zero earnings are projected for all years after the
date an individual left the labor force; otherwise we use the date when respondents in the selfreported retirement sequence said they expect to stop working (or 62 if that was missing, or 70 if
the expectation was working past 70). For the expected date of claiming Social Security benefits,
we use the respondent’s self-report of when (s)he expects to receive Social Security benefits;
again using 62 if missing and 70 for 70 and over. We assume the date of receipt of pension
benefits corresponds to the date of receipt of Social Security benefits. For those who already
started receiving Social Security benefits when first asked, we assume they started receiving
benefits at age 62. With these assumptions, we may miss some of the gaming by sophisticated
claimants. However, we do not count any pension received against WEP if the payments are
observed before the expected Social Security claiming age, so someone who claimed the pension
early and did not expect to claim Social Security until later is allowed to game the system.
To set the stage, Table 7 reports the present values of Social Security benefits with and
without WEP adjustments and the present values of pensions from covered and from uncovered
employment, all at the respondent level. These calculations are made for a number of different
populations classified by their employment history in covered and uncovered work. The present
values of Social Security and pension benefits for members of both the original HRS cohort and
the Early Boomer cohort are reported in 1992 dollars.

24

As seen in column 1, among the 1,105 respondents in the original HRS cohort who ever
reported a non-covered job, WEP and GPO offsets reduce Social Security wealth from $76,828
to $71,599, or by 6.8 percent. The comparable reduction for the Early Boomer cohort in rows 5
and 6 if column 1 is 7.2 percent (75,844/81,686). From column 2, for the 548 HRS cohort
respondents who worked in non-covered jobs offering a pension, and thus were potentially
subject to GPO, WEP and GPO adjustments average 13.0 percent (64,179/73,810). For the Early
Boomers, the reduction is 14.3 percent (72,455/84,541). Turning to column 3, within the HRS
cohort, those having worked in a noncovered job offering a pension, while also earning Social
Security benefits in other employment, and thus who are subject to WEP, have their benefits
reduced by WEP and GPO adjustments by an average of 14.3 percent (71,788/83,804).The
comparable reduction within the Early Boomer cohort is 15.2 percent (77,949/91,870).
Among those who worked in uncovered employment, the pensions earned from
uncovered work were substantially higher than the pensions from work on jobs covered by
Social Security. Part of the reason is that when a job was not covered by Social Security, the
pension benefit was designed to make up for the shortfall. From row 3, column 1, pension wealth
from uncovered work is $84,339 for members of the original HRS cohort who ever worked in
uncovered employment, while from row 4, column 1, it is $29,195 from work in covered
employment. Within the Early Boomer cohort, the comparable figures are $85,846 and $14,926.
Among those members of the original HRS cohort who held an uncovered job that also offered a
pension, the pension from uncovered work is worth $160,460 (row 3, column 2). This is almost
twice the value of Social Security for all employees ($87,686 in row 1, column 5). The
comparable ratio for the Early Boomer cohort is roughly 1.4 to 1 (148,948/105,608).
All told, those in the original HRS cohort who ever worked in an uncovered job earned a
total of $185,133 in present value from Social Security after adjustment for WEP and GPO plus
pensions from uncovered and from covered employment (71,599 + 84,339 + 29,195, from
column 1, rows 2, 3 and 4). In comparison, government employees who always worked in
covered employment had almost identical pensions and Social Security, worth $182,994 (89,072
+ 93,922 in column 4, rows 1 and 4). Comparable numbers from the Early Boomer cohort also
suggest that pension values plus Social Security are slightly lower for those who ever worked in
an uncovered job, $176,616 (75,844 + 85,846 + 14,926), compared to government employees
who always worked in covered employment, $197,986 (109,218 + 88,768).

Table 8 provides a further break down of WEP and GPO adjustments among various
respondent groups. Column heads report the population groups according how their benefits are
affected by WEP and GPO, and for comparison, for all government or non-covered employees,
and among all employees.
In Table 8 we define WEP adjustments as the reduction in benefits due to the WEP
adjustment alone. The GPO adjustment is calculated as the total effect of reducing benefits to
account for both WEP and GPO, less the value of the WEP adjustment. WEP and GPO
adjustments for the relevant population groups are reported in rows 1 and 2 of Table 8. Values of
Social Security benefits before and after the adjustments are reported in the next three rows, with
the ratios of adjusted to unadjusted Social Security values reported in rows 5 and 6 of each panel.
Once we disaggregate, care is required in making comparisons between the original HRS
sample, with over fifty observations in even the smallest cell, and the Early Boomer cohort,
where the number of observations falls to 16 for those subject to both WEP and GPO.
Looking across row 1 for the original HRS cohort, the largest WEP adjustment is in
column 1, $16,427 for the 269 respondents who are affected by WEP alone. For the Early
Boomers, the largest WEP adjustment is found in row 8, column 3, which includes those affected
by WEP and GPO. There are only 16 observations in that cell, however. Looking across row 2,
the largest GPO adjustment of $41,531 falls on the 85 respondents who are subject to WEP and
GPO. That is, their benefits are reduced by GPO by $41,531 above and beyond the $6,583
reduction in their benefits due to WEP alone. Looking at the comparable cell for Early Boomers,
once again the largest adjustment, $16,737, is for those affected by both WEP and GPO. For the
original HRS cohort, the GPO adjustment for those affected only by GPO amounts to $8,900.
The comparable value for the twelve observations we have for Early Boomers is $6,151.

Among the population of 420 respondents to the original HRS cohort affected by either
WEP or GPO, comparing rows 1 and 2, column 4, the WEP adjustment is $11,854 and the GPO
adjustment is another $9,804. Together these adjustments reduce the present value of Social
Security benefits by 32.1 percent (45,868/67,526) among the affected population. The
comparable figures for the 105 respondents in this cell for the Early Boomer cohort, the value of
Social Security benefits are reduced by 23.9 percent (61,866/81,334). Among all government or
non-covered employees, in the original HRS cohort, WEP and GPO together reduce benefits by
2.8 percent (81,666/83,978), and among all employees, by 0.9 percent (85,774/86,550). In the
Early Boomer cohort, WEP and GPO together reduce benefits by 2.1 percent (97,527/99,594),
and among all employees, by 0.7 percent (102,743/103,431).
Table 9 reports these same values for households. Once again, in some disaggregated
categories the cell sizes for the Early Boomer cohort are sometimes quite small. In row 1, the
largest WEP adjustment is in column 3, $17,812 for the 141 HRS cohort households affected by
both WEP and GPO. There is only a slightly smaller WEP adjustment ($17,496) among those
households affected by WEP and not GPO. There are similar results within the Early Boomer
cohort, where the largest WEP adjustment is for the 27 households affected by both WEP and
GPO. Looking across row 2, for the original HRS cohort, the largest GPO adjustment of $28,805
again falls on the 141 households subject to WEP and GPO. That is, their benefits are reduced by
GPO by $28,805 above and beyond the $17,812 reduction in their benefits due to WEP alone.
Similarly, the largest GPO adjustments for the Early Boomers are in the 27 households affected
by both WEP and GPO, at $12,589. The GPO adjustment for those HRS households affected
only by GPO amounts to $5,612, while there is only one household falling in that category in the
Early Boomer cohort.

Comparing rows 1 and 2, column 4, among the 292 HRS households affected by either
WEP or GPO, the WEP adjustment is $17,050 and the GPO adjustment is another $14,101,
reducing the present value of Social Security benefits by 24.1 percent among the affected
households (98,235/129,386). For the Early Boomer cohort, among the 76 HRS households
affected by either WEP or GPO, the WEP adjustment is $22,402 and the GPO adjustment is
another $4,495, reducing the present value of Social Security benefits by 18.5 percent
(118,757/145,654). Among households with at least one government or non-covered employee,
in the HRS cohort, WEP and GPO together reduce benefits by 2.5 percent (143,032/146,740),
and among all households with at least one past or current employee, by 0.9 percent
(135,858/137,130). The comparable figures for the Early Boomer cohort are 1.8 percent
(169,085/172,182) and 0.6 percent (160,283/161,305).
Table 10 relates the present values of the Social Security and pension benefits, and the WEP
and GPO adjustments, to the household’s total wealth.14 From column 1, row 4, households from
the original HRS cohort affected by the WEP adjustment lose $17,496 (142,677 - 125,181), or
12.3 percent of their benefits. The comparable group of Early Boomers loses 11.7 percent of
their benefits (15,920/136,603). As seen in column 2, households from the HRS cohort affected
by GPO and not by WEP lose $5,612 (72,309 – 66,697), or 7.8 percent of the present value of
their benefits. Those from the Early Boomer cohort affected by GPO only lose $1,709, or 1.8
percent of their basic benefit. By far the largest impact is on households affected by both WEP
and GPO. Those from the original HRS cohort lose $45,786 (117,764 – 71,978) in present value
of benefits, or 38.9 percent of their total Social Security benefits. Those subject to WEP and
GPO from the Early Boomer cohort lose 28.7 percent of their benefit (46,964/163,653). Taking
these households together in column 4, those from the HRS cohort affected by either WEP or
GPO lose $30,596 (128,348 – 97,752), or 23.8 percent of their total Social Security benefits.

14

Note that there is a slight difference between Tables 9 and 10. Because we are dealing
with total wealth in Table 10, we have trimmed the observations to eliminate those in the top and
bottom 1 percent of wealth holding households. Table 9 includes those households.
33

Members from the Early Boomer cohort lose 18.5 percent of their basic benefit
(26,907/145,805).
These benefit losses are small compared to the public pensions received, which range from
$143,000 and $167,000 for members of the original HRS cohort, and from $135,000 to $150,000
for the three groups of Early Boomers where there are at least 25 observations. For members of
the original HRS cohort affected by WEP or GPO, the umbrella group, benefits lost amount to
ten percent of the value of pensions plus Social Security they in fact receive (30,596/305,478)
and to 6.1 percent of their total wealth (30,596/497,635). Comparable losses for members of the
Early Boomer cohort amount to 8.7 percent (26,907/310,086) of total Social Security plus
pension wealth and 5.3 percent of total wealth (26,907/507,113).
Among all government or non-covered employees in the original HRS sample, or all
employees, these losses represent a much smaller fraction of total wealth, amounting to eight
tenths of one percent of wealth for government employees (3,654/472,777) and three tenths of
one percent of total wealth for the all employees (1,257/402,959). Comparable losses from
members of the Early Boomer cohort are six tenths of one percent and two tenths of one percent
respectively.

Table 11 puts the adjustments to Social Security in further perspective by reporting the
total wealth for affected households classified according to the structure of the household.
Among the households affected by WEP and GPO, in the original HRS cohort as reported in
Table 11A, households headed by a single woman have less than half the wealth of households
headed by a single man (194,279/410,424), with two person households having one third more
wealth than those headed by a single man (549,926/410,424). There are too few observations in
Table 11B to make a similar comparison for the Early Boomers.
Comparing the adjustments in benefits due to WEP or GPO in row 4 with the Social
Security wealth of affected households after adjustment in row 3, the adjustments represent a
much larger share of Social Security wealth for one person female households. The reduction in
benefits amounts to 51.7 percent of basic benefits (26,345/50,937) for one person female
households compared to 28.5 percent for one person male households (14,108/49,555) and 29.9
percent for two person households (32,227/107,865). The benefit reduction for one person
female households in the Early Boomer Cohort is 28.3 percent of the value of Social Security
(17,376/61,405), while the reduction is 21.9 percent for couple households (30,540/139,534). For
the original HRS cohort, these adjustments amount to 13.6 percent (26,345/194,279) of the total
wealth of single female households, 3.4 percent (14,108/410,424) of the total wealth of single
male households, and 5.9 percent (32,227/549,926) of the total wealth of affected couple
households. The comparable reductions for the Early Boomer cohort are 5.5 percent
(17,376/318,174) for single female households and 5.3 percent for couple households
(30,540/576,971).

VI. Disaggregating the Effects on the WEP Adjustment into the Effects of
Adjusting the Benefit Formula and the Effects of Limiting the Adjustment According to
Pension Income
Some earlier studies used the adjustment in the benefit formula (the replacement rate up
to the first bend point) to estimate the size of the WEP adjustment. In their calculations they
ignored the limitation on this adjustment to half the value of pensions from uncovered work.
Ignoring the limit on the WEP adjustment to half the value of the pension from uncovered
work leads the size of the actual WEP adjustment to be overstated by roughly 150 percent.
Table 12 provides the details for this calculation. First, the benefit is calculated without
the WEP adjustment. For the original HRS cohort, the present value of Social Security without
a WEP adjustment averaged $76,828 (column 1). With the WEP adjustment, including the
limitation of WEP to half the value of the pension from uncovered work, the present value of
Social Security benefits is $72,619 (column 2). So the actual WEP adjustment for this HRS
cohort amounts to $4,209 (column 4). Comparable numbers for the Early Boomer cohort are
$81,692 (column 1) and $76,892 (column 2), so the WEP adjustment amounts to $4,800
(column 4).
When we assume an artificially large pension, we can isolate the size of the WEP
adjustment due only to the change in the reduction in the Social Security replacement rate from
90 percent down to a minimum of 40 percent. This allows us to determine the full effect of the
formula change in the absence of any mitigation from the pension on the uncovered job. From
column 3, when the WEP reduction is not limited to half the size of the pension, the Social
Security benefit for members of the original HRS cohort is reduced to $66,695, a total
reduction due to the change in the PIA formula of $10,133. Thus the limitation of the Social
Security benefit to half the size of the pension from uncovered employment reduces the penalty
from WEP for members of the original HRS cohort by $5,924, by 58 percent. For the Early
Boomers, the change in the PIA benefit formula alone would reduce benefits by $12,476, so
consideration of the pension from uncovered work reduces the WEP penalty by $7,676, or by
61.5 percent.

While pensions mitigate the effect of the WEP adjustment to Social Security benefits,
pensions from uncovered employment are part and parcel of the GPO adjustment,
mechanically reducing spouse and survivor benefits of those with a public pension by two
thirds of the value of that pension. Thus on the one hand, consideration of public pensions
significantly reduces the downward adjustment to Social Security benefits due to WEP for
those who worked in uncovered employment; on the other hand, consideration of pensions
from uncovered employment is the sole determinant of the downward adjustment in spouse
and survivor benefits from GPO.

VII. Conclusions
This paper has investigated the effects of Social Security’s Windfall Elimination
Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO) provision on Social Security benefits
received by individuals and households. A number of the innovations in this study turn out to
be of central importance to having a full understanding of the effects of WEP and GPO
adjustments. Unlike previous studies, we take explicit account of pensions earned on jobs not
covered by Social Security, a key determinant of the size of WEP and GPO adjustments. Also
unlike previous studies, we focus on the household. This allows us to incorporate the full
effects of WEP and GPO on spouse and survivor benefits, and to evaluate the effects of WEP
and GPO on the preretirement assets accumulated by affected families.
Our analysis is based on data from the original cohort of the Health and Retirement
Study (HRS) and the most recent cohort for which a full set of required information is
available. We constructed households from HRS data, estimated the paths of covered and
uncovered employment and earnings for each spouse over their lifetimes, estimated the values
of pensions from uncovered work, calculated Social Security benefits using the Social Security
Administration’s ANYPIA program, and calculated the sizes of any WEP and GPO offsets. We
also estimated the relations between the sizes of these adjustments and pension and other
wealth accumulated by retirement age.
Among our specific findings are the following:


Of 7,623 households in the original HRS cohort, 3.8 percent are subject to either WEP

or to GPO. The comparable figure for the Early Boomer cohort is 3.5 percent.

42



Among the HRS households affected by either WEP or GPO, the WEP adjustment is

$17,050 and the GPO adjustment is another $14,101, reducing the present value of Social
Security benefits by 24.1 percent among the affected households. For the Early Boomer cohort,
WEP and GPO reduce the present value of Social Security benefits by 18.5 percent.


For members of the original HRS cohort affected by WEP or GPO, benefits lost amount

to ten percent of the value of pensions plus Social Security they in fact receive and to 6.1
percent of their total wealth. Comparable losses for members of the Early Boomer cohort
amount to 8.7 percent of total Social Security plus pension wealth and 5.3 percent of total
wealth.


By far the largest impact is on households affected by both WEP and GPO. Those from

the original HRS cohort lose $45,786 in present value of benefits, or 38.9 percent of their total
Social Security benefits. Those subject to WEP and GPO from the Early Boomer cohort lose
28.7 percent of their benefit.


We also decomposed the effects of the WEP adjustment into two parts, the part due to

the use of a lower replacement rate up to the first bend point in the PIA formula, and the
mitigation of this adjustment by the pension. Limiting the reduction in the Social Security
benefit to half the size of the pension from uncovered employment reduces the penalty from
WEP for members of the original HRS cohort by $5,924, that is, by 58 percent. For the Early
Boomers, the reduction in the replacement rate alone would lower benefits by $12,476, so
limiting the adjustment to half the value of the pension from uncovered work reduces the WEP
penalty by $7,676, or by 61.5 percent.
We have also discussed the rationale for the specification of WEP and GPO
adjustments to Social Security benefits under current law. This law is designed to address a
number of perceived inequities when those who work on jobs not covered by Social Security
also become eligible for own, or for spouse or survivor benefits under Social Security.
The law does meet a number of its purposes. However, the limitation of the WEP offset
to half the value of the pension mitigates the effects of this adjustment. The clear winners in
this system are the individuals who benefit from the progressive Social Security benefit
formula, having worked in both covered and uncovered employment, having become entitled
to a Social Security benefit, but who had little or no pension from uncovered work. These

43

individuals experience only modest effects of WEP and GPO adjustments. Consequently, they
have gained a higher rate of return to Social Security taxes paid than those who continuously
work in covered jobs. The reason is that work in uncovered employment is counted as zero
years of earnings.
It has been argued that the WEP adjustment disproportionately affects low wage
workers because it is applied only up to the first bend point of average indexed earnings.
However, this argument ignores the effect of limiting WEP adjustments to half the value of the
pension earned on the uncovered job. Social Security benefits will only be affected if the
individual has high enough earnings in government or other uncovered employment to
generate a large pension. Consequently, those who criticize the design of WEP and GPO on
distributional grounds are exaggerating their case. This is not to say, however, that there is no
case for redesign.
In addition, the law does not address all potential inequities. The Government Pension
Offset adjustment seems fair when comparing two earner households with identical earnings
histories. In one, both spouses always worked in covered employment and paid payroll taxes.
In the other, the lower paid spouse did not work in covered employment and thus did not pay
taxes. In the absence of the GPO, the household where the low earner worked in uncovered
government employment would not have the top up to spouse benefits reduced by own Social
Security benefits, as is standard for dual beneficiaries. That household would therefore receive
higher spouse and survivor benefits than the household where work was exclusively in covered
employment. On the other hand, GPO seems to be quite unfair to affected households when
they are compared to one earner households, where one spouse receives the full spouse or
survivor benefits. Here we have two households, where the primary earner paid Social Security
taxes in both, while the spouse did not. Yet one will receive full spouse and survivor benefits,
while the other will have spouse and survivor benefits reduced or eliminated. At the heart of
this problem is the disparate treatment favoring one earner over two earner households,
whether the low earner of the two earner household worked in uncovered employment, or only
in covered employment.15

benefit formula, see Gustman and Steinmeier (2001) and Gustman, Steinmeier and Tabatabai (2013).

We conclude by reminding the reader of a number of caveats affecting our estimates of
WEP and GPO adjustments. First, respondents underreport the extent they work for a
government employer. To partially deal with this underreporting, we counted a respondent as
working for a government if there is a self-report of having worked for a federal, state or local
government employer, or if the respondent reported working in an uncovered job. But not all
jobs that are not covered by Social Security are government jobs. Second, there are small
inconsistencies in the Social Security records that we use to identify covered and uncovered
employment. Third, throughout the analysis, we calculate WEP and GPO adjustments using
respondent self-reports about expected pension values, which we link to uncovered
employment. GAO (2007) indicates that government pension income is not always accurately
reported to the Social Security Administration by affected workers. To the extent that
government pensions are underreported to SSA, we overstate the size of WEP and GPO
adjustments. Fourth and last, we remind the reader of a caveat we noted at the outset. We have
not included behavioral responses to WEP and GPO as affected respondents and members of
their households react to the incentives created by these policies. It is, of course, unclear how
many understand these incentives and make their employment and benefit election choices
with these incentives in mind.
