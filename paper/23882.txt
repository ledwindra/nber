ABSTRACT
Most regulations designed to reduce environmental externalities impose costs on individuals and
firms. An active body of research has explored how these costs are disproportionately born by
different sectors of the economy and/or across different groups of individuals. However, much
less is known about the distributional characteristics of the environmental benefits created by
these policies, or conversely, the differences in environmental damages associated with existing
environmental externalities. We review this burgeoning literature and develop a simple and
general framework for focusing future empirical investigations. We apply our framework to
findings related to the economic impact of air pollution, deforestation, and climate, highlighting
important areas for future research. A recurring challenge to understanding the distributional
effects of environmental damages is distinguishing between cases where (i) populations are
exposed to different levels or changes in an environmental good, and (ii) where an incremental
change in the environment may have very different implications for some populations. In the
latter case, it is often difficult to empirically identify the underlying sources of heterogeneity in
marginal damages, as damages may stem from either non-linear and/or heterogeneous damage
functions. Nonetheless, understanding the determinants of heterogeneity in environmental
benefits and damages is crucial for welfare analysis and policy design.

Economists have long understood that the benefits to environmental regulations are unlikely to be
evenly distributed across individuals within a given population. As early as the 1980’s, researchers and
policy makers became specifically concerned that lower income populations might be disproportionately
exposed to and impacted by environmental externalities, such as air and water pollution, leading rise
to the notion of “environmental justice” (see e.g., US GAO (1983) and United Church of Christ
(1987)). We review and discuss what is understood about the distribution of environmental benefits
(or conversely, damages), while highlighting how policies designed to mitigate environmental damages
alter this distribution. An established literature has long considered how different environmental policy
instruments produce winners and losers by imposing different regulatory costs on individuals (Baumol
and Oates, 1988; Parry et al., 2006; Fullerton, 2017), but because a large share of environmental
benefits correspond to non-market outcomes, such as health impacts, they are often more difficult to
trace than the direct pecuniary costs of the regulation itself. Due to this difficulty, it is not generally
known if most environmental policies are, on net, progressive, regressive, or have no distributional
effects (Fullerton, 2011; Parry et al., 2006; Bento, 2013).
The purpose of this article is to review and explore the existing empirical literature to better
inform our understanding of the distribution of environmental benefits. We organize our discussion
using a general framework that is designed to describe how distributional effects of environmental
policy may be generated while also demonstrating where existing research findings “plug in.” We
believe this approach is useful because it focuses our attention on features of findings that may point
towards the existence or absence of distributional effects; it is also helpful in highlighting what remains
unknown. We use this framework to organize research findings in three core areas of study in empirical
environmental economics—pollution, deforestation, and climate change. These three topic areas are
generally considered at three very different spatial scales and are currently studied with differing levels
of sophistication. However, all three can be placed in our common framework, demonstrating its broad
applicability.

An environmental policy may generate an uneven distribution of benefits across populations if
(i ) the policy delivers uneven quantities of an environmental good and/or (ii ) the benefits from an
incremental improvement in the environmental good differ across populations. The first case is largely a
question of what a policy does to the distribution of the environmental good (e.g., how a policy affects
local air quality). While conceptually straightforward, there exists significant challenges associated
with both measurement and attribution of observed changes to a particular policy. At the heart of
second case lie questions about the underlying sources of heterogeneity in benefits/damages associated
with an incremental change in the environment. These differences may stem from uneven baseline
levels of exposure combined with non-linear damage functions. These differences may also arise because
damage functions differ across populations (e.g., due to differences in the underlying stock of health
and/or differences in defensive investments).1 Individuals might also have differing preferences over
environmental goods that potentially alter how exposure maps into individual well-being or welfare. In
cases where environmental benefits are thought to be distributed unevenly, identifying which of these
mechanisms drives the unequal impact is key to understanding how distributional effects should be
valued and possibly ameliorated through policy.
To date, empirically identifying the causes of heterogeneous marginal damages has had only modest
success. Econometrically, the core difficulty is that observable predictors of heterogeneity in damage
functions (e.g., income) are not randomly assigned. Thus, empirically determining what drives any
observed heterogeneity in damages, whether it is income or one of many other factors correlated
with income (e.g., defensive investments, health stock, or baseline exposure), is difficult. Nonetheless,
solving this empirical problem is important because the source of heterogeneity matters for valuation
or computing marginal damages (Grossman, 1972; Courant and Porter, 1981; Bartik, 1988). This
identification challenge plagues many environmental policy contexts and will likely require creative
research designs to solve.

Structure of the problem
We believe it useful to break down the central conceptual components associated with environmental
externalities and the ways that they are differentially manifested among segments of the population.
An environmental externality (described here as a “damage,” i.e. negative benefit, for simplicity) is
a social cost that may be written as a general function of two components: the level of exposure
to environmental conditions e and a vector of attributes x that may influence how exposure affects
measures of economic well-being:
Damage = f (e, x)
where f (.) is a function that translates exposure and individual attributes into damages in welfare
terms, such as a willingness-to-pay. We define exposure e as the state of the environment at an
arbitrary point in time and space. For example, exposure refers to the physical amount of air pollutant,
deforestation, and/or temperature that a location experiences at a moment in time. In most cases,
exposure is measured in physical units that describe some dimension of the environmental system in

well-being or welfare (i.e. social costs).

question, such as “parts per million” for air pollution, “share of land cleared of trees” for ecosystem
services, or “maximum daily temperature” for climate.2 We note that the vector of attributes x that
may interact with exposure through the damage function f (.) are potential underlying sources of
vulnerability, i.e. factors that may make individuals more vulnerable to exposure by making it costlier
for them to experience. Vulnerability, as it is usually defined in the literature3 , is the rate at which
exposure to an environmental condition generates harm given some initial social and environmental
conditions; it is essentially the slope of the damage function f (.) given some initial attributes x and
exposure e. Vulnerability could depend on a wide range of factors that differ across individuals–
such as baseline health, avoidance behavior, or defensive investments. Many of these factors could be
considered forms of human-made capital and thus their influence on f (.) may be understood to indicate
some substitutability or complementarity with the form of natural capital described by e (Solow, 2012).
Thus, in this framework, exposure is only converted into terms of economic cost through a function that
describes the vulnerability of an individual or population, i.e. how exposure (treatments) translate into
costs (treatment effects). In order to simplify the problem, we assume that, conditional on the same e
and x, the damage function is constant across individuals. By way of an example using air pollution–
exposure refers to the amount of the harmful air pollutant in the atmosphere, whereas vulnerability,
which depends on x, tells us how that concentration will ultimately translate into changes in individual
welfare. Thus, heterogeneity in environmental benefits may manifest through differences in levels of
exposure e, and/or differences in the vector of mediating attributes x that may interact with exposure
through the damage function.
A policy change may alter the exposure of individual i from its pre-policy state ei to a post-policy
state ei + ∆ei , producing a benefit equal to the change in damages
∆Damagei = f (ei + ∆ei , xi ) − f (ei , xi )
The policy may have distributional consequences for two possible reasons. First, if the change in
environmental exposure ∆ei differs substantially across individuals, then the change in damages will
also likely differ, regardless of what the initial allocation of ei is or the structure of f (.). Second, even
if the change in exposure is relatively uniform across individuals (perhaps because it is marginal for
all i), distributional effects may result from the policy if marginal damages
∂Damagei
∂f (ei , xi )
=
∂e
∂e
differ across individuals. Understanding the first case is primarily a challenge of simulating, forecasting
or measuring the response of physical systems to policies (Mauzerall et al., 2005; Hansen et al., 2013;
2 Some existing frameworks discussing air pollution damages distinguish between “ambient concentration” (the measured parts per million in the atmosphere), “dose” (how much did an individual ingest), “response” (the relationship
between the dose and health outcomes), and “valuation” (the welfare costs of the health response). In our framework e
corresponds to ambient concentration (which is affected by policy), and f (.) translates e into welfare terms. Differences
in “dose”, “response”, and “valuation”—as they are used in that literature—are manifested through the different ways
that the vector of attributes x mediate the translation of e into damage through f (.).
3 For example, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change defines vulnerability as “The propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. Vulnerability encompasses a variety of concepts and elements including sensitivity or
susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt. A broad set of factors such as wealth, social status, and
gender determine vulnerability and exposure to climate-related risk.” (Oppenheimer et al., 2014).

Figure 1: Different marginal effects are measured (black tangent lines) for two populations at different
exposure levels (e1 and e2 ) because there is a single nonlinear damage function (left) or the two
populations exhibit different damage functions, i.e. differing vulnerability, based on attributes (xj1 and
xj2 ) that are correlated with exposure levels.

Stocker, 2014)—a challenging scientific task that is usually not under the purview of economists but
which is nonetheless essential to policy analysis (see e.g., Muller and Mendelsohn (2009) and Fowlie,
Holland, and Mansur (2012)). Understanding the second case remains a core challenge for empirical
economists.
In general, heterogeneity in marginal damages generates distributional effects of environmental
policy benefits, since some individuals will benefit or be harmed more or less for incremental changes
in environmental conditions. If marginal damages are positively correlated with income levels, then
policies that reduce exposure uniformly across a population will have regressive benefits since wealthier
populations benefit more from the policy. If marginal damages are negatively correlated, such a policy
would have progressive benefits.
As illustrated in the left panel of Figure 1, heterogeneity in marginal damages could stem from nonlinearities in the relationship between exposure and damages holding other factors constant, i.e. if f (.)
is non-linear with respect to e then two individuals facing different baseline levels ei will experience
different marginal damages, even if they are identical in terms of all other factors that determine
vulnerability:

∂ 2 Damage

Alternatively—or in addition—heterogeneity in marginal damages may stem from heterogeneity in an
underlying attribute, here the jth element in x, that controls how exposure translates into damages,
i.e. xj may affect vulnerability:

illustrated in the right panel of Figure 1.
Identifying cases where marginal damages are heterogenous is usually sufficient to conclude that

environmental policy may have uneven benefits. However, designing efficient environmental policy
and/or addressing any resulting distributional effects may require understanding the source of this
heterogeneity. Do they differ because baseline exposure differs or because vulnerability differs? For
example, does warming a country’s climate harm poor countries more because they have greater vulnerability to climate (Dell, Jones, and Olken, 2012) or because poor countries tend to be hotter and
damages are nonlinear in temperature (Burke, Hsiang, and Miguel, 2015)? These two different explanations for the same empirical observation generate highly divergent forecasts for global economic
development in a scenario where countries both warm and become wealthier simultaneously, leading
to different policy prescriptions. If vulnerability to heat results from being poor, then policies might
focus on reducing future vulnerability by reducing future poverty, whereas if nonlinearities generate
high marginal effects of heat regardless of income, then policies might focus on reducing overall exposure to heat by mitigating climate change. This example highlights the importance of understanding
underlying sources for these types of heterogeneity.
In cases where heterogeneous marginal damages generate distributional impacts of environmental
policies, empirically decomposing the sources of heterogeneity is important for understanding the social
costs of environmental externalities and for considering potential policy interventions. Moreover, the
extent to which we can extrapolate damages measured in one population to others depends on our
understanding of how heterogeneity in damages is manifested.

Two practical empirical considerations
Beyond standard econometric concerns regarding causal inference and the identification of marginal
effects (see e.g., Angrist and Pischke (2010)), two particularly important and general measurement
issues arise when trying to understand the distributional benefits of environmental services and/or
policy.
First, many policies or exogenous events will change environmental exposure in different areas
by different quantities. Measuring these heterogenous changes in exposure is difficult because data
measuring exposure is often imperfect and/or incomplete. Moreover, mismeasurement of exposure can
exacerbate the challenges associated with understanding the nature and magnitude of heterogeneous
marginal damages. Since marginal damages are measured in cost per unit of exposure, comparing
marginal damages across contexts requires that marginal losses are identified relative to an objective
and physically consistent measure of exposure. This can present a challenge when comparing marginal
damages if the spatial scales of measurement for exposure vary substantially across studies (e.g.,
examining pixels vs. countries) or if exposure is encoded using context-specific and/or non-physical
units. For example, it is often econometrically convenient to transform environmental exposure into
a binary variable, such as encoding observations with high levels of deforestation or tropical cyclone
strikes as a dummy variable equal to one. However, such an approach may not allow meaningful
comparisons of marginal damages across contexts since variation in physical exposure experienced
by populations may differ dramatically between observations that are all encoded using a common
“treated” dummy.
The second measurement challenge stems from the difficulty at empirically distinguishing between
the two cases in Figure 1, even when levels of environmental exposure are well measured and heteroge-

5

nous marginal effects are convincingly estimated. This identification problem stems primarily from the
fact that researchers often observe only a single tangency on a dose-response function, rather than the
entire function for different sub-groups. Thus, when researchers observe differences in marginal effects,
it may be hard to identify if these differences stem from different points on the same, non-linear dose
response function or points on different dose-response functions. For example, baseline levels of environmental exposure (ei ) are rarely randomly assigned, and they are often correlated with covariates
xi . For this reason it is often difficult to demonstrate that there exists a homogenous and nonlinear
response function (left panel of Figure 1). Moreover, even if levels of environmental treatment e are
randomly assigned, the covariates x are usually not, making it difficult to pin down which elements in
x cause differences between dose-response functions. As highlighted above, understanding the reasons
for which dose-response functions differ is crucial both for valuing damages as well as understanding
how damages may be mitigated through policy. For example, if we observe different dose-response
functions for different income groups, these differences in responses may not be driven by income but
instead some other correlated unobservable (e.g., baseline health stock). The ideal solution to this
identification problem would be a situation in which we observe exogenous variation in (i) baseline
exposure, (ii) changes in exposure, and (iii) changes in observable predictors of heterogeneity (e.g., income, air conditioning, or other defensive investments). These conditions are rarely met, which makes
this a difficult empirical problem—however, we will point towards research designs that approximate
this ideal setup below.

Some observations and questions regarding air pollution, deforestation, and climate
We now discuss several findings and provide new analysis regarding the distribution of benefits for
three broad classes of widely studied environmental externalities—air pollution, deforestation, and
climate change. These three examples span the possible spatial dimensions of impact, from local to
regional to global. We apply the framework above by separately considering whether populations are
unequally exposed to different baseline levels of the externality (or environmental good) in the crosssection, whether different populations exhibit heterogenous marginal damages, and, if so, whether there
is evidence that these differences are driven by nonlinear damage functions or heterogenous damage
functions (i.e. differing vulnerability).
We point to numerous remaining gaps in the literature while also providing some suggestions as to
how researchers may make progress in these areas. We do not intend to be comprehensive, but instead
we focus on results which highlight various aspects of the research frontier and which demonstrate
the importance of carefully measuring exposure while considering nonlinearity and other forms of
heterogeneity. We begin with the most localized externality, air pollution, then proceed to questions
related to deforestation and ecosystems services, which have distributional consequences at somewhat
larger spatial scales. We then conclude by discussing climate impacts and climate change, which can
have distributional effects across very large spatial scales.

Air pollution
Pollution data availability often precludes granular and/or spatially continuous analyses. Even in the
United States (US) it remains difficult to measure exposure to air pollution: of 3144 counties, only 1289
have monitors for criteria air pollutants at any point between 1990-2013. As a result, studies exploring
differential air pollution exposure have generally focused on a select set of cities where detailed data
are available (e.g., Depro, Timmins, and O’Neil (2015)) or communities that are sufficiently proximate
to a facility that emits toxic air pollutants such that certain levels of exposure can reasonably be
assumed (e.g., Been and Gupta (1997); Banzhaf and Walsh (2008)). Recent advances in measurement
and modeling may address some of these longstanding data challenges. For example, researchers have
recently created ambient pollution data products for the US over time by merging fixed-site pollution
monitors, satellite- derived NO2 estimates, and GIS-derived land-use data (see e.g., Novotny et al.
(2011)). These granular and spatially continuous air pollution measures may afford researchers new
possibilities, such as the ability to connect pollution exposure with high resolution demographic data.
We use the data from Novotny et al. (2011) to explore differences in pollution exposure across US
Census Block-Groups.4
Some cross-sectional patterns in air-pollution exposure
In the US, cross-sectional differences in air pollution exposure are ubiquituous. A range of empirical
papers that date back to the 1970’s documented that low income individuals disproportionately live in
areas with higher environmental risk (Freeman, 1974; Harrison and Rubinfeld, 1978), closer to toxic
facilities (Brooks and Sethi, 1997) and Superfund hazardous waste sites (Hamilton, 1993; Currie, 2011),
and/or power plants (Davis, 2011). However, the evidence on differences in air pollution exposure has
been relatively indirect and piecemeal due to the measurement challenges described above. We shed
some additional light on differential pollution exposure by using newly available, high-resolution data
on ambient NO2 levels in the US (Novotny et al., 2011). We link these gridded pollution data to
the 2010 Decennial Census at the Block-Group level and explore relationships between income and
pollution exposure. Figure 2A plots average NO2 levels in each of the 932 Metropolitan Statistical
Areas (MSA) against the MSA household-level income.5 MSAs with higher average household income
are also MSAs with higher average ambient NO2 levels. This occurs because spatial heterogeneity in
air pollution in the United States is closely tied to population density – cities are more polluted than
rural areas on average. Since cities, on average, have higher per capita income than rural areas, the
unadjusted, cross-sectional correlation between air pollution exposure and average household income
in an MSA is positive.
However, MSA-level aggregates obscure a tremendous amount of household-level variation in exposure levels. Figure 2B plots the relationship between Block-Group household average income percentiles
(based on the national Block-Group income distribution) and average NO2 levels in the Block-Group
4 See Clark, Millet, and Marshall (2014) for a complementary descriptive exercise of pollution exposure using these
same data.
5 These MSA-level statistics are created by taking the population-weighted average of Block-Group pollution measures
within an MSA. Block-Group income is reported as population counts in various income categories. We impute the
average income in a Block-Group by taking the mid-point of the income bin and creating a population weighted average
across income bins. For the unbounded top income category (i.e. income above $200,000) we use the $200,000 as opposed
to an undefined mid-point.

income percentile. We see that, on average, there is a U-shaped relationship between income and
exposure, with low and high income percentile Block-Groups in the United States disproportionately
exposed to high ambient pollution levels relative to Block-Group income percentiles towards the center
of the national income distribution. This finding can be partially reconciled with Figure 2A by noting
that some of the wealthiest and poorest Block-Groups are both located in large MSAs – MSAs that,
on average, have higher pollution levels.
Importantly, national cross-sectional patterns differ from patterns of environmental exposures
within a given MSA. In order to look at the average within-MSA relationship between income and
exposure, we compute the percentile of average income for each Block-Group separately within each
MSA. We then compute the average exposure level for each percentile and plot this relationship in
Figure 2C. The within-MSA correlation appears to be opposite of what is observed across MSAs:
the average relationship between pollution exposure and income within MSAs is strictly negative, with
poorer areas in each MSA characterized by higher levels of ambient pollution than richer areas. Similar
disparities exist for other monitored criteria air pollutants.
An area of interest for future inquiry is how these cross-sectional relationships change over time.
One striking fact that emerges from extending our analysis above is that the gap in ambient air
pollution levels between relatively affluent and less affluent households may be closing. Repeating the
analysis in Figure 2C using data from 2000 suggests that households in low-income areas of an MSA
have seen much larger recent improvements in air quality relative to nearby households in wealthier
Block-Groups. While more research is needed to understand this pattern, such convergence in outcomes
seems likely to be driven by the targeted nature of Clean Air Act (CAA) regulations. For example, the
CAA abates pollution in areas of a city/county where pollution levels are highest, leading to relatively
larger environmental benefits for poorer Block-Groups within an MSA (Bento, Freedman, and Lang,

8

2015).
Identifying heterogeneous marginal effects of air pollution
A persistent negative correlation between air pollution exposure and income per capita in the crosssection suggests that the air pollution burden is not borne equally across the population. However,
disproportionate exposure need not necessarily mean disproportionate differences in damages or wellbeing. For example, if air quality is a normal good, then lower-income households may choose to
consume less of the environmental good in exchange for cheaper housing. In addition, individuals who
choose to live in more polluted areas may have invested in measures to protect themselves against
disproportionate exposure such as the purchasing of air filters or buying bottled water. To understand
whether differences in exposure correspond to differences in well-being, we need information on the
marginal damage associated with a given level of exposure, an area where researchers have made
substantial progress over the past 15 years. We discuss a few of these studies, focusing on work that
attempts to address what we believe are the first order statistical challenges in this area – in particular
concerns pertaining to bias stemming from omitted variables.
Starting with the pioneering work by Chay and Greenstone (2003a,b) researchers have exploited
research designs appropriate for causal inference to deliver well-identified estimates of the average
effect of a one unit change in air pollution exposure on health and welfare. These approaches allow
researchers to begin exploring heterogeneity in the causal effects of pollution exposure, possibly caused
by differences in observable characteristics of the population and/or non-linearities in the dose-response
function. For example, Chay and Greenstone (2003b) explore heterogeneity in the infant-health doseresponse function across different races – finding that African Americans have more negative health
responses to increases in air pollution than do Whites in their sample. Similarly, Currie and Walker
(2011) observe that health effects of traffic related air pollution are larger for African Americans
relative to Whites. Jayachandran (2009) observes a striking difference in the mortality effects of
pollution between richer and poorer places. Arceo, Hanna, and Oliva (2016) find that the mortality
effects of carbon monoxide in Mexico are almost ten-times the effects found in similar estimates for US
populations (Currie and Neidell, 2005). Schlenker and Walker (2015) find those over the age of 65 are
more vulnerable to marginal changes in carbon monoxide exposure (CO) and, similarly, Deschenes,
Greenstone, and Shapiro (Forthcoming) observe significantly larger responses in elderly mortality to
variation in NOx exposure.
The evidence above suggests that air pollution dose-response functions are heterogeneous across
different subgroups of the population. However, there is much less evidence that these differences
in health-related dose-response functions translate into differences in marginal damages or welfare.
Moreover, attributing observable heterogeneity in a dose-response function and/or marginal damages
to a single explanatory factor is challenging since the underlying explanatory factor may be endogenous
or correlated with important unobservable factors. For example, heterogeneity in pollution-induced
mortality by income could arise because low-income individuals are more vulnerable to air pollution
exposure–perhaps because of low baseline health or limited protective investments–or because they
disproportionately live in areas with higher levels of exposure and the dose-response function is nonlinear. If the dose-response function is non-linear and rich and poor communities have unequal levels

9

of baseline pollution exposure, then marginal effects will differ for the same dose-response function (i.e.
left panel of Figure 1). Alternatively, or in addition, low income individuals may have lower levels of
baseline health for which a one unit increase in air pollution can lead to more severe mortality effects
(i.e. right panel of Figure 1). Few, if any, analyses explore the causes of treatment effect heterogeneity
by exploiting exogenous variation in potential mediating factors (including baseline exposure), and
this seems like a clear direction for future research. As discussed above, these distinctions matter for
understanding the efficacy of any policy responses designed to alleviate any of the observed disparities.
Some policy discussions concerning air pollution
Even with well-identified average dose-response functions, understanding the distributional benefits
of air pollution policy remains challenging. One difficulty stems from the fact that the underlying
source of heterogeneity in the dose-response function matters for welfare and incidence of a policy. For
example, if some individuals invest in defensive behavior, which alters the dose-response relationship
for this sub-population, then the costs of these investments should be included in estimates of the
marginal damage (Grossman, 1972; Courant and Porter, 1981; Bartik, 1988). The absence of random
variation in the observable predictors of treatment effect heterogeneity makes it difficult to pinpoint the
precise source of heterogeneity – a crucial ingredient for welfare analysis. Future researchers therefore
must develop creative research designs to understand the distributional benefits of environmental
policies. For example, did the CAA disproportionately improve the plight of some groups of individuals
relative to others because it targeted locations with high baseline exposure levels? The law leads to
substantial spatial heterogeneity in the way in which it impacts air quality around the United States,
begging the question as to how these changes map to different subgroups of the population and the
corresponding benefits. Moreover, it might be the case that improvements in environmental quality
affect market prices and/or wages in ways that could differentially impact household welfare, and
understanding the distributional impacts of environmental policy requires researchers to grapple with
these general equilibrium issues. For example, Bento, Freedman, and Lang (2015) show that lowerincome homeowners tended to enjoy the greatest benefits from the 1990 CAAA, as these were the
homeowners located in areas that experienced the largest improvements in air quality. Based on house
price appreciation, households in the lowest quintile of the income distribution received annual benefits
from the program equal to 0.3% of their income on average during the 1990s, over twice as much as
those in the highest quintile. However, higher-income households are more likely to be homeowners,
and thus may be more likely to reap the benefits of any capitalization of environmental improvements
into property values (Grainger, 2012). While the literature on the distributional benefits of the Clean
Air Act tells us that air quality has improved disproportionately in low income areas, it says relatively
little about how low income consumers differentially value the same marginal improvement in air
quality. More generally, understanding how willingness to pay for non-market amenities varies with
income is a fundamental question for discussing incidence of environmental benefits, but the existing
evidence is weak and indirect – much of the observed heterogeneity observed in WTP by income may
be driven by other observable or unobservable factors that are simply correlated with income. One
potentially promising path forward would be to find settings where a researcher has exogenous changes
in both income and pollution, which can be used to estimate these possible interactions.

Deforestation and associated ecosystem services
Ecosystem services encompass a broad number of ways in which ecosystems benefit society. We limit
our discussion to those services that accrue to non-owners of the resource; i.e. those that are not
completely internalized by the owners’ use of the resource. Timber and non-timber products from
a single-owner forest are not considered externalities; while pest control, soil fertility, and watershed
services may constitute externalities when accrued to non-forest owners. This distinction is important,
as the existence of public benefits of ecosystems is what motivates many policy interventions, both
from an efficiency standpoint and from any approach that values distributional effects.
Even within this narrower definition of ecosystem services, the measurement of their benefits faces
a unique challenge – namely, the diverse nature and geographic scope of all externalities that fall in
this category. Ecosystem services as externalities emerge from a wide array of human interactions with
nature. For example, humans rely on forests for watershed services, erosion prevention, soil fertility,
local climate, global climate, preservation of biodiversity, recreation, etc. Other natural resources,
such as water bodies, coral reefs, and wetlands, provide an equally diverse set of services. For our
discussion of the distribution of benefits stemming from ecosystems we will focus on forests, as they
are the source of numerous ecosystem services and their location, health, and evolution is relatively
well documented. Greater availability of forest data has also facilitated research on this particular
system, and thus a wider literature sheds light on patterns and sources of heterogeneity in ecosystem
services from forests. Nevertheless, many of the conceptual and empirical issues that we highlight are
common to ecosystem services that are not related to forests.
The two main challenges associated with studying ecosystem services are measurement and valuation. Many of the services that forests provide, such as soil fertility, local biodiversity, erosion protection
are often difficult to track and measure in a comprehensive way. Moreover, even if researchers could
measure these services well, it is often difficult to estimate or measure how forest cover affects these
services. Forests may affect other ecosystems in a variety of ways and at very different geographic
scales. For example, while exposure to soil fertility benefits might be limited to a few meters from a
forest, local biodiversity services (e.g., pest control) could extend up to 0.5-10 km from the forest’s
edge (Bianchi, Goedhart, and Baveco, 2008; Karp et al., 2013), and watershed services may extend
to entire river basins, which can span several countries (Myers, 1997). Even if researchers are able to
estimate the complex relationships between forest cover and other ecosystem services, it is exceedingly
difficult to understand how these services are valued. There is rarely an observed market price for
these services, and some of the services provided may benefit individuals thousands of miles away
through recreational uses and/or “existence value”. Researchers have used a wide variety of empirical
methods to try to monetize these benefits, ranging from stated-preference, survey based methods to
other revealed-preference methods, such as hedonic valuation. We discuss this literature in more detail
below.

and various measures of socioeconomic status.6 Figure 3A plots the cross-country relationship between
forest cover (as a percentage of total land) and the logarithm of GDP per capita. This figure points to
tremendous variation in forest endowments across both rich and poor countries. Thus, if the marginal
benefits of additional forest preservation were similar across countries, policies aimed at preserving
current forest stocks across all countries would have neutral distributional effects.
Country averages are a relatively crude measure of exposure to forest ecosystem services which
might mask important within country heterogeneity. However, sub-national data on exposure to
forest cover linked to demographic characteristics is not available for many countries. The World
Bank Indicators do provide information on the rural poor as a percentage of overall population, and
since forests are by definition rural, we can use this data to crudely explore whether relatively poor
populations systematically have higher or lower exposure to forest ecosystem services. Figure 3B
shows no systematic relationship between the share of rural poor and forest cover. Thus, even when
conditioning on the relative size of population that would be most likely exposed to ecosystem services
(i.e., rural populations), exposure to forest cover stocks appears uniform across countries. This coarse
proxy for poverty potentially near forests could mask important differences in actual forest endowments
across income groups within a country, especially for the extreme poor. Some of these within-country
differences have been documented by the literature. For example, 84% of tribal ethnic minorities in
India live in forested areas (Mehta and Shah, 2003), and large overlaps between severe poverty and
forests exist within China and Vietnam (Li and Veeck, 1999; Sunderlin and Huynh, 2005).
While forest stocks play a role in the generation of ecosystem services, forest policies operate on
the margin of these stocks by altering flows, partially determining if stocks are increasing or decreasing
at a moment in time. Figures 3C and 3D plot the relationship between forest cover changes between
2000 and 2010 against GDP per capita and rural poverty, respectively. Positive numbers indicate
afforestation, and negative values denote deforestation. A clear positive relationship emerges between
forest cover changes and income, with a corresponding negative relationship between forest cover
change and rural poverty. Afforestation rates are higher in wealthier countries, and differential forest
protection may partially explain this pattern (Frank and Schlenker, 2016). This being said, countrywide measures of forest cover change may mask differential exposure to deforestation within countries.
For example, Andam et al. (2010) note that communities in Costa Rica and Thailand near protected
areas that reduced deforestation have below-average income. While there is some evidence to suggest
heterogeneity exists in exposure to ecosystem services, much less is known about how incremental
changes in exposure may be differentially valued.
Identifying heterogeneous marginal effects of deforestation
The evidence on heterogeneity in WTP for ecosystem services has generally explored how WTP varies
with income using survey-based, contingent valuation methods. This literature consistently reports
that the income elasticity for ecosystem services provided by forests and wetlands is less than one
6 The cross-country relationship between income and deforestation has received substantial attention from studies
testing for the existence of an “Environmental Kuznets Curve” (EKC) – the idea that exposure to deforestation is higher
for economies in transition undergoing rapid industrialization (Cropper and Griffiths, 1994; Van and Azomahou, 2007).
Over time, as countries become wealthier, they tend to increase the area of land under protection (Frank and Schlenker,
2016). Our goal here is not to revisit this literature but instead document how forest exposure may differ across different
sub-groups and what that may mean for the regressivity/progressivity of various land use policies.

13

(Kristrom and Riera, 1996; Hökby and Söderqvist, 2003). An elasticity less than unity implies that a
homogenous increase in the exposure to the environmental amenity in question would disproportionately benefit low income groups. However, contingent valuation methods and results have been heavily
criticized (see e.g., Diamond and Hausman (1994) and McFadden (1994)), and accordingly some researchers have tried to estimate income elasticities of demand for environmental goods directly. For
example, Kahn and Matsusaka (1997) use voting data on environment-related propositions in California to estimate the demand elasticity with respect to income, obtaining a positive income elasticity for
an array of measures, such as park bonds and the preservation of mountain lions and forests. It is only
at high income levels that the number of votes begin to fall with income for some measures, such as
park bonds. These results are consistent with the provision of parks being progressive for some ranges
of income.7
The empirical evidence of heterogeneity in marginal benefits is relatively sparse. As mentioned
above, understanding the underlying causes of heterogeneity is important for designing more efficacious
policy solutions. More specifically, it is important to distinguish between non-linearities, preferenceand production-driven heterogeneity, and heterogeneity stemming from market failures that may disproportionately affect low income groups. The presence of non-linearities in benefits means policies
that target areas with larger or smaller baseline forest stock could have a differential impact. As
discussed earlier, it appears that current afforestation and expansion of protected areas is disproportionately occurring in wealthier countries. However, the wide range of baseline forest cover, for all
levels of income, combined with potential non-linearities in benefits obscure the overall distributional
consequences of these policies. There also may exist heterogeneity in estimated WTP stemming from
uneven exposure to market failures (e.g., credit constraints and information imperfections). This heterogeneity is important because revealed preference methods, that rely on assumptions pertaining to
complete and well-functioning markets, may not accurately reflect the true change in welfare in the
presence of market failures. For example, a WTP income elasticity estimate that exceeds one could
stem from credit constraints binding for low income individuals (Greenstone and Jack, 2015). Differences in information across socioeconomic groups could also generate a misleading correlation (of
either sign) between WTP and income.
Empirically, it is difficult to distinguish between sources of heterogeneity in marginal benefits associated with the expansion of ecosystem services, but a few studies provide evidence on the relative
importance of different factors. For example, landscape diversity may be a potential source of environmental/ecosystem endowments that can lead to heterogeneity in benefits associated with forest
expansion.8 There may also be substitutes for ecosystem services that might insulate communities
from any damages associated with the depletion of the underlying resource (e.g., credit and insurance
markets). For example, populations that have sound health infrastructure may be less affected by
deforestation driven infectious diseases, such as malaria (Garg, 2014). Relatedly, households that live
7 Note that the income elasticity of demand can differ from the income elasticity of WTP when dealing with quantityrationed collective goods (Hanemann, 1991; Flores and Carson, 1997). In such a case, the income elasticity of WTP is
a sufficient statistic for benefit incidence, whereas the income elasticity of demand is typically not (Flores and Carson,
1997; Ebert, 2003).
8 The marginal benefit of expansion may vary as a function of diversity – monocultures may enable agricultural insect
pests to thrive due to an absence of predators and abundant food, necessitating greater insecticide use and possible
negative impacts on human health, ecosystem services, and ecological communities (Larsen, 2013; Larsen, Gaines, and
Deschênes, 2015).

near forest sometimes report using environmental extraction (e.g., consumption of bushmeat) as a
mechanism for coping with economic shocks, such as crop failure or major livestock loss (Noack et al.,
2016). Jayachandran et al. (2017) also finds that farmers preserve more trees in response to payments
to ecosystem services if they report having cut trees for large emergency expenses in the past, again
pointing to missing insurance markets as a source of variation in marginal benefits. However, the
diversity in the types of services that forests and other ecosystems provide suggests that many other
sources of variation in the benefits are plausible. In our view, this is clearly an area of research that
will gain from additional empirical work.
A policy consideration regarding deforestation
A different but potentially important source of heterogeneity in benefits from ecosystem services discussed above are transfers that result from explicit ecosystem service transactions, such as payments
for ecosystem services (PES). These transfers become available when the market failure externality
associated with ecosystem destruction is internalized through market-driven compensation schemes –
those who bear the opportunity cost of preserving the resource are compensated by those who experience the benefits it provides. Countries with poor governance, for example, may benefit less from these
markets if they are unable to enforce contracts and agreements, making them less able to capitalize
on the world-wide services their national ecosystems provide. Conte and Kotchen (2010) provides evidence consistent with low income countries having less credible enforcement of PES contracts, finding
that the price of voluntary carbon offsets related to forestry is much lower for the poorest countries.
As Grieg-Gran, Porras, and Wunder (2005) note, the degree to which PES can benefit the poor
likely depends (i) on how competitive low income populations are vis-a-vis other providers for similar
services, (ii) on the rules of the program (or eligibility criteria), and (iii) on the transaction costs
involved in securing the payments. They find that eligibility rules are the most salient feature of
PES schemes that are likely to influence the distribution of a program’s benefits in the five Latin
American case studies. Some programs have hectare caps, to limit the amount of payments that
go to large wealthy landowners. However, other rules, such as formal land ownership, may limit
access to the program for the poor. Few empirical studies examine the distribution of PES payments
across socioeconomic groups and their resulting welfare impact. The absence of empirical evidence is
in part due to the paucity of socioeconomic information regarding participants and non-participants
available to researchers. Alix-Garcia, Sims, and Yañez-Pagans (2015) examine the incidence of a
large PES program in Mexico and is one of the few studies to collect such information. They find
no distributional impacts stemming from differential exposure as “enrolled land had a similar degree
of poverty as the national distribution”. However, they find small progressive impacts stemming
from differential marginal effects; consumption and investment appear to be slightly higher among
the poorest recipients in the study. Additional research on the design and impact of PES programs,
exploiting similarly granular data in other contexts, should be a high priority as decision-makers around
the world increasingly employ these policies.

Climate and climate change
Early economic assessments of climate change, such as the DICE model developed by Nordhaus and
Boyer (2000), were representative-agent models focused on inter-temporal optimization, i.e. the distribution of benefits across generations. However, these models are unable to capture distributional
effects among contemporaries because only a single economic agent experiences economic loss from
climate change. As research on the economics of climate (today) and climate change (in the future)
has progressed, these contemporaneous distributional effects have received increasing attention in both
“bottom up” national analyses (Deschenes and Moretti, 2009; Hsiang et al., 2017) and “top down”
global analyses (Anthoff, Hepburn, and Tol, 2009; Burke, Hsiang, and Miguel, 2015).
Econometric measurement of the benefits of climate policy faces different challenges when compared to air pollution or ecosystem services policies. An abundance of high-frequency inter-temporal
variation in climatic variables (i.e. weather) is plausibly exogenous (see e.g., Deschênes and Greenstone
(2007) and Schlenker and Roberts (2009a)), but utilizing this variation to compute economic impacts
of non-marginal climate changes requires some care (Hsiang, 2016). A central empirical challenge
has been determining how exposure to the climate can be appropriately measured, then gathering
and transforming various climatic data into these measures for integration to econometric models
(Auffhammer et al., 2013).
Some cross-sectional patterns in climate exposure
Baseline climatic conditions at present are primarily a function of geographic endowments, determined mainly by large-scale geophysical processes beyond the control of society. It is thought that
these endowments may have persistent economic consequences (Gallup, Sachs, and Mellinger, 1999;
Hornbeck, 2012b; Nordhaus, 2006; Schlenker, Hanemann, and Fisher, 2006; Hsiang and Jina, 2015).
However, since populations might select into different locations based on how their preferences map
onto the climatological endowment (Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson, 2001; Olmstead and Rhode,
2011; Hornbeck, 2012a; Albouy et al., 2016; Deryugina, Kawano, and Levitt, Forthcoming), it is difficult to measure the causal effect of natural endowments directly.
The possibility of persistent economic effects of endowments has contributed to the general “folk
wisdom” in policy circles that poor populations are systematically exposed to the most damaging
climates today and will face the largest changes in the future (Kahn, 2005; Adger, 2006; IPCC, 2014;
World Bank, 2017; Hallegatte et al., 2015). While it is true that poor populations tend to live in hotter
and drier locations, both within and across countries (Nordhaus, 2006; Park et al., 2015), there are
notable exceptions within countries (e.g., Florida, California, and Arizona in the United States), and
across countries (e.g., Singapore and major oil-producing countries in the Middle East). Furthermore,
some evidence suggests this cross-sectional association has changed over time (Acemoglu, Johnson,
and Robinson, 2002). Tropical countries, which tend to be poor, are the most exposed to the El Niño
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Hsiang and Meng, 2015), although wealthy Australia is notoriously
heavily exposed as well (Nicholls, 1989). Tropical cyclones (the class of phenomena including hurricanes, typhoons and tropical storms) tend to move away from the equator for physical reasons and
their baseline distribution across space is spread fairly evenly across global income categories—we show
this in the cumulative distribution function in Figure 4A, which we compute by overlaying the global

cyclone climatology from Hsiang and Narita (2012) on the global pixel-level population distribution
(CIESIN, 2005) sorted by their estimated location in the global income distribution from Sala-i Martin
(2006). Roughly 35% of the two poorer terciles are never exposed to a tropical cyclones, whereas 45%
of the richest tercile is never exposed. However, this high-income advantage reverses when the intensity
of cyclones is considered: a relatively larger fraction of the rich tercile is exposed to tropical cyclone
winds of any intensity above those equal to “tropical storm” status (according to the Saffir-Simpson
intensity scale). Current tornado climatologies represent perhaps the most extreme counter-example of
standard intuition: because the strong temperature and pressure gradients required to generate tornadoes only exist over land in the middle latitudes, tornado exposure is almost exclusive to populations
that are relatively wealthy (US, Europe, and Australia) or middle income (South Africa, Argentina,
and China) (Goliger and Milford, 1998).
The projected distribution of exposure to future climate changes with little or no mitigation is
also more complex than the simple notion that poor countries will face the largest quantities of adverse exposure. There is negative correlation between current average income and the magnitude of
future average temperature changes across locations, and little correlation between income and rainfall changes. Average temperature changes (∆ei in the sense of Figure 1) are expected to be most
extreme in northern locations, which tend to be wealthier today, and lowest in the tropics (Stocker,
2014; Hsiang and Sobel, 2016). However, changes in exposure to extremely hot temperatures (e.g.,
> 30◦ C), which are often thought to be the most damaging events, will be largest for the poorest
populations around the world. This is shown in Figure 4B, which shows the difference between the
probability distribution of temperature exposure in 2080-2099 under warming relative to the present.
These differences show how the expected experience of an individual drawn at random, from the global
income terciles computed above, change with warming. The largest positive change occurs for poor
and middle income terciles above > 29◦ C, indicating that these individuals will experience many more
days at these very high temperatures.
Changes in future rainfall are substantially less certain and more mixed with no clear association
with current income (Stocker, 2014), since the deep tropics and high latitudes get wetter while subtropics tend to dry out. Changes in future tropical cyclone distributions are similarly unrelated to
current incomes, with the strongest intensification expected in the East Asia, weakening in the Indian
ocean, and unclear changes in the Atlantic (Knutson et al., 2010). Thus, overall, there is little support
for the notion that exposure to future climate changes are inherently greater for poorer populations.
However, once one accounts for the potentially heterogeneous marginal effects of these changes, future
damages seem likely to be larger for poor populations.
Identifying heterogeneous marginal effects of climate
Dose-responses from climatic conditions are usually compared among contemporaries across different
locations, such as vulnerability across different counties (e.g., Annan and Schlenker (2015)) or countries
(e.g., Hsiang, Meng, and Cane (2011)), or within a fixed location but varying over time (e.g., Roberts
and Schlenker (2011)). When examining contemporaries, the core question is usually either (i) whether
some social or economic attribute of a population, such as higher income and stronger institutions (e.g.,
Dell, Jones, and Olken (2012)), cause them to suffer larger or smaller responses from climatic exposure,

18

or (ii) whether populations more regularly exposed to a specific type of climate are better equipped
to cope with the type of events characteristic of that climate (e.g., Hsiang and Narita (2012)). In
this second case, the intuition is that if populations experience a climatic event more frequently, they
may have learned about that event and invested in precautions that will limit their losses each time
the event occurs. A similar intuition holds when examining how marginal effects evolve with time,
since populations may gradually learn about their climate and then develop and deploy technologies
to cope with specific events they expect to occur, causing their marginal losses to gradually decrease.
All of these comparisons are primarily descriptive and cannot usually be interpreted as causal, since
there is not exogenous variation in those factors that might be determinants of vulnerability. However,
Hsiang, Burke, and Miguel (2013) point out that in some contexts a potential cause of vulnerability
could be credibly identified (or ruled out) if some exogenous change causes a key channel to appear for
the first time or to be abruptly obstructed if it was already present, and a corresponding sharp change
(or absence of change) in marginal losses is observed at that moment. Some recent examples of this
approach include the demonstration that work-for-pay programs in India reduce the sensitivity of local
violence to rainfall (Fetzer, 2014) and the sensitivity of child test scores to temperature (Garg, Jagani,
and Taraz, 2017). Also, Sarsons (2015) shows that access to dams does not alter the rainfall-violence
link in India. Hornbeck and Keskin (2014) found that new irrigation technologies reduced US farmers’
sensitivity to drought when they also had access to a major aquifer, and Barreca et al. (2016) provide
evidence that the introduction and deployment of air-conditioning technologies reduced the marginal
impact of temperature on mortality in the US. We view these papers as a promising step forward,
and future researchers should attempt to identify additional settings where there exists exogenous
variation in both exposure but also potential mediating factors (i.e. components of the vector x in our
framework).
In many cases where dose-responses are observed to differ significantly across populations, economic
explanations may be consistent with these patterns. For example, Hsiang and Narita (2012) show how
high spatial concentration of capital in rich countries may lead to higher defensive investment and
lower responsiveness from cyclones, and Davis and Gertler (2015) demonstrate patterns of climaterelated energy demand may reflect the influence of income on air-conditioning demand. Some patterns
of heterogeneity suggest the existence of additional market failures. Credit constraints likely bind
in many lower income contexts, causing individuals to under-invest in protective measures, such as
air-conditioning (Burgess et al., 2011), or adopt ex-post coping strategies that may be effective in the
short run but extremely costly in the long run, such as disinvesting in children (Maccini and Yang,
2009; Anttila-Hughes and Hsiang, 2011) or engaging in transactional sex (Burke, Gong, and Jones,
2015).
In numerous cases, as documented by Carleton and Hsiang (2016), dose-response functions are
similar between low and high income countries. For example, a frequent observation is that rich and
poor populations respond to certain types of climate exposure with similar marginal losses, when one
might expect wealthy populations to be more adapted and thus exhibit lower climate sensitivity. For
example, Figure 4C displays the long-run effect of tropical cyclones on GDP growth from Hsiang and
Jina (2014), where relative income losses per unit of exposure for rich and poor countries appear to
be almost identical. Understanding why such adaptation gaps persist in some cases and not others is

19

an important challenge for future research.
Other than looking at the role of income, another line of inquiry is to ask whether learning shapes
marginal effects by comparing dose-response functions from short-lived vs. gradual changes (Dell,
Jones, and Olken, 2012; Burke, Emerick et al., 2016). This class of analysis attempts to determine
whether observed differences in responsivness within a population are due to experience and subsequent
adaptation; the hope is that such insight might also explain differences in climate sensitivity across
populations. The motivation for this comparison is the intuition that if populations can endogenously
alter their sensitivity through learning and adaptation in the long run, the marginal effects of slow
climate changes should be less damaging than those of unexpected short-lived events (Shrader, 2016).
However, if the observed marginal effects are similar across these cases, that may suggest limited
scope for effective adaptations (Moore and Lobell, 2014). A continuous version of this approach is
to filter time series or panel data at all temporal frequencies and estimate climate sensitivity at each
frequency of climatic variation (Hsiang, 2016). Despite these efforts, the literature has had limited
success pinning down systematic patterns for the relationship between climate sensitivity at short and
long time scales.
Separate from any notion of adaptation, another major source of heterogeneity in climate sensitivity
stem from nonlinearities in the dose-response function—a relationship that may be more mechanical in
nature than indicative of deeper economic dynamics. Nonlinear responses to climate have been carefully identified in a number of contexts, whether examining effects of climate on crop yields (Schlenker
and Roberts, 2009b; Schlenker and Lobell, 2010), mortality (Deschênes and Greenstone, 2011), energy
demand (Aroonruengsawat and Auffhammer, 2011), social instability (Hidalgo et al., 2010), property crime (Ranson, 2014), permanent migration (Bohra-Mishra, Oppenheimer, and Hsiang, 2014),
labor supply (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014), human emotion (Baylis, 2015), cognitive performance
(Graff Zivin, Hsiang, and Neidell, forthcoming), human capital formation (Park, 2017), or income
(Deryugina and Hsiang, 2014; Isen, Rossin-Slater, and Walker, 2017). In these cases, the baseline
climate of a population may play a large role in determining the marginal damages from climate
simply because the population’s initial position on the dose-response function may exhibit a steeper
or shallower slope. Burke, Hsiang, and Miguel (2015) demonstrate the importance of this issue by
showing that a nonlinear relationship between temperature and economic growth appears statistically
similar to a situation where poor countries have large negative marginal effects of temperature because they are poor (i.e. because poor countries are also systematically hotter than rich countries).
However, the economic projections (or counterfactuals) under global warming differ dramatically depending on whether heterogeneity is assumed to be caused by income or by non-linear temperature
responses. Frequently, the strong correlation between the economic characteristics of populations and
their baseline climates makes it exceptionally challenging to determine which drives heterogeneity
in marginal damages. Furthermore, it is also possible that these nonlinear dose-response functions
strengthen differences in baseline economic characteristics. For example Hsiang et al. (2017), demonstrate that strong nonlinearities in dose-response functions lead to a highly regressive distribution of
climate change damages across counties in the US (see e.g., Figure 4D), likely increasing pre-existing
patterns of economic inequality.

20

Some policy considerations concerning climate change
One of the most important questions arising from these findings is to understand how large populations respond and (possibly) reorganize in response to such uneven exposure and damages from climate
change—and what policy-makers should do in response. Labor may respond to changes in local productivities induced by the climate by migrating (Hornbeck, 2012a; Feng, Oppenheimer, and Schlenker,
2012; Colmer, 2016). If climate damages are largest in poorer locations then labor movement to richer
locations could reduce the regressive impacts of climate. However, pre-existing barriers to labor mobility may prevent equalization of marginal labor productivity across locations (Desmet, Nagy, and
Rossi-Hansberg, 2015; Missirian, Schlenker et al., 2017), and climate changes may directly affect the
feasibility of migration in the presence of credit constraints (Kleemans and Magruder, Forthcoming).
Adjustments in trading patterns could also partially alleviate some uneven impacts of climate (Jones
and Olken, 2010; Costinot, Donaldson, and Smith, 2016), but large-scale patterns of unequal damages
could potentially be worsened by trade (Newbery and Stiglitz, 1984; Dingel, Hsiang, and Meng, 2017).
Perhaps the more concerning possibility is that large-scale uneven impacts of climate change may
destabilize existing institutional arrangements, increase incentives to violently redistribute wealth, or
generate other forms of social conflict (Hsiang, Burke, and Miguel, 2013; Axbard, 2016; Obradovich,
2017). A large number of historical analyses suggest that conflict and the breakdown of social order
are regular responses to the large-scale reorganization of climate-related wealth (Kuper and Kröpelin,
2006; Yancheva et al., 2007; Haug et al., 2003; Bai and Kung, 2010; Chaney, 2013), but little is known
about the modern risk of these outcomes, how to prevent them through policy, or optimal responses
to these types of events once they are underway. Understanding the extent of this risk, and how it
might be managed, seems an important area for future research.

Discussion
There exists tremendous heterogeneity in exposure to environmental externalities at both a local and
global level. This heterogeneity has led researchers to question whether some populations disproportionately bear the burden of environmental damages, with substantial concern that poor populations
are differentially harmed. Recent econometric work has clarified some cases in which this is true and
others in which the data run counter to this intuition. A pervasive difficulty in the interpretation
of previous literature that documents heterogeneity in dose-response functions by income is that, in
many cases, it remains unclear whether the heterogeneity stems from differences in exposure levels
or differences in the structure of the response function across populations. The possible presence
of nonlinear response functions and non-uniform exposure complicates the determination of whether
marginal damages fundamentally differ across groups, especially when exogenous variation in factors
that might affect responsiveness is absent. Understanding the underlying source of heterogeneity in
dose-response functions is important to understand the benefits of future policy decisions. We see the
investigation into the underlying causal determinants of heterogeneity in dose-response functions as
being a key research area going forward. As mentioned, we believe a promising path forward is to
identify settings whereby researchers can combine exogenous variation in both an exposure variable of
interest and also a potential source of heterogeneity (e.g., income or access to a defensive technology).

21

A second difficulty that often arises in this literature is translating damages measured in physical
quantities, such as “number of deaths” or “acres of forest cleared,” into welfare measures that may be
compared across contexts and outcomes. This is especially true when there are unobserved tradeoffs
made by individuals in a market equilibrium, which may implicitly compensate individuals for their
willingness to tolerate increased exposures and/or risk (Rosen, 1974). In some cases, researchers have
turned to hedonic approaches that deliver results which can be interpreted in welfare terms under some
assumptions. In other cases, researchers assign standardized valuations to physical quantities, such
as valuing statistical lives, although such valuations may not always be well identified or grounded
in empirical observations. Despite these efforts, it is widely understood that these solutions are incomplete and/or not universally applicable. Thus, developing robust and generalizable approaches for
recovering empirical welfare measures of non-market amenities is currently a core frontier problem in
understanding the distribution of environmental damages.
We close by posing a challenge to researchers. The finding that poor populations, in many contexts,
might be differentially exposed or impacted by environmental conditions suggests one of the most difficult but (potentially) important unanswered questions in this research space: Do any environmental
damages have impacts long-lasting enough to generate persistent feedback loops? For example, if being
poorer causes households to suffer relatively larger losses from the environment, then can this damage
in turn cause that household to be poorer and suffer larger losses yet again in the next generation?
Such feedbacks would be important to identify, since they may give rise to long-run compounding
distributional consequences with potentially large welfare implications. Compelling empirical evidence
of any such a feedback loop is lacking, but there exist some cases where cross-sectional—and possibly
long-run—patterns are similar in sign or structure to the short-run effects that the empirical literature has mostly focused on. For example, nonlinear cross-sectional distributions of income across
temperatures (Nordhaus, 2006) are broadly consistent with short-run effects of temperature on income
growth (Burke, Hsiang, and Miguel, 2015). Similarly, some of the most impoverished regions of the
United States are areas with the highest levels of ambient air pollution (Spira-Cohen et al., 2010,
2011). However, in both cases, it remains completely unknown if any of these observed cross-sectional
relationships match the short-run evidence coincidentally or causally. Could environmental factors
be a key driver for the distribution of wealth we observe in the world today? Credibly identifying
such long-run effects will likely require that we deeply understand the long-run dynamic response to
environmental conditions, a problem that we believe is the most valuable target for future inquiry.
