ABSTRACT
We study trading behavior and the properties of prices in informationally complex markets. Our model
is based on the single-period version of the linear-normal framework of Kyle (1985). We allow for
essentially arbitrary correlations among the random variables involved in the model: the value of the
traded asset, the signals of strategic traders and competitive market makers, and the demand from liquidity
traders. We show that there always exists a unique linear equilibrium, characterize it analytically, and
illustrate its properties in a series of examples. We then use this characterization to study the informational
efficiency of prices as the number of strategic traders becomes large. If liquidity demand is positively
correlated (or uncorrelated) with the asset value, then prices in large markets aggregate all available
information. If liquidity demand is negatively correlated with the asset value, then prices in large markets
aggregate all information except that contained in liquidity demand.

Introduction

Whether and how dispersed information enters into market prices is one of the central questions of
information economics. A key obstacle to full information revelation and aggregation in markets is
the strategic behavior of informed traders. A trader who has private information about the value of
an asset has an incentive to trade in the direction of that information. However, the more he trades,
the more he reveals his information, and the more he moves the prices closer to the true value of
an asset. Thus, to maximize his profits, an informed trader may stop short of fully revealing his
information, and so the informational efficiency of market prices may fail.
Thus, an important and natural question is when we should expect market prices to in fact
reflect all information available to market participants. One stream of literature considers trading
in dynamic environments, with informed traders having multiple opportunities for trading.1 In
these settings, in each period, traders may have an incentive to withhold some of their information
in order not to eliminate their profits. However, over time, traders will gradually reveal all of their
information, and in many (although not all) cases, by the end of trading, market prices will in fact
aggregate all available information.
One issue with the case of dynamic trading is that while at the end, market prices accurately
reflect all available information, that is generally not the case during most of the time the market
is in operation—and thus much of the trading may happen at prices that are far away from the
ones that would prevail if all private information was publicly available to all market participants.
Therefore, another important stream of research abstracts away from the time dimension and
repeated trading in markets, and considers instead an alternative intuition for when market prices
may accurately reflect information: when the number of informed traders is large, and each one
of them is informationally small. In that case, each of the informed traders has limited impact on
market prices, but their aggregate behavior does in fact reflect the aggregate information available
in the market. As a result, market prices are close to those that would prevail if all private
information were publicly available, and all trades happen at those prices.
Non-strategic explorations of this intuition go back to Hayek (1945), Grossman (1976), and
Radner (1979).2 Subsequently, a line of research (which we discuss in more detail in Section 2) has
considered strategic foundations for this intuition, studying strategic behavior of informed agents in
finite markets, and then considering the properties of prices as the number of these agents becomes
large. This stream of work, however, imposes very strict assumptions on how information is distributed among the agents, typically assuming that the signals of informed agents are symmetrically

Other foundational papers in the rich literature on Rational Expectations Equilibrium and related non-strategic
solution concepts include Kreps (1977), Hellwig (1980), Allen (1981), and Anderson and Sonnenschein (1982); for
surveys of the literature, see Jordan and Radner (1982), Allen and Jordan (1998), and Glycopantis and Yannelis
(2005). These papers focus on equilibrium existence and the amount of information aggregated and communicated
by prices in equilibrium, but only consider environments with either an infinite number of infinitesimally small
traders, or with a finite number of traders who essentially ignore the impact they have on market prices and behave
non-strategically.

distributed, or satisfy other related restrictions so that in equilibrium, the strategies of all informed
traders are identical (see Section 2). In practice, however, the distribution of information in the
economy can be much more complex. Some agents may be strictly more informed than others.
Groups of agents may have access to different sources of information, so that the correlations of
signals within a group are very different from correlations across groups (and the sizes of the groups
may be different, and the correlations of signals between different groups may be different as well).
Some agents may be informed about the fundamental value of the security, while others may be
uninformed about the fundamentals but possess some “technical” information about the market or
other traders. And of course all such possibilities may be present in a market at the same time.
Our paper makes two main contributions.
First, we present an analytically tractable framework that makes it possible to study trading in
such informationally complex environments. Our model is based on the single-period version of the
model of Kyle (1985). As in that paper, an important assumption that makes our model analytically
tractable is the assumption of joint normality of random variables involved in the setting: the true
value of the traded asset, the signals of strategic traders, the signals of competitive market makers,
and the demand coming from liquidity traders. Beyond that assumption, however, we impose
essentially no restrictions on the joint distribution of these variables, making it possible to model
informationally rich situations such as those described above. In this framework, we show that
there always exists a unique linear equilibrium, which can be computed analytically.
Second, we explore the informational properties of equilibrium prices as the number of informed
agents becomes large. We assume that there are several types of agents, with each agent of a given
type receiving the same information, and fix the matrix of correlations of signals across the types
(and other random variables in the model). We then allow the numbers of agents of every type to
grow (without restricting the rates of growth in any way; e.g., the number of agents of one type
may grow much faster than the number of agents of another type). We find that the informational
properties of prices in these large markets depend on the informativeness of the demand from
liquidity traders. If the demand from liquidity traders is uncorrelated with the true value of the
asset or is positively correlated with it (conditional on other signals), then prices in large markets
aggregate all available information. If, however, the demand from liquidity traders is negatively
correlated with the true value of the asset, then prices in large markets aggregate all available
information except that contained in liquidity demand.
We also illustrate our model with several applications. One example shows that under fairly
simple (but, crucially, asymmetric) information structures, an informed trader may choose to trade
“against” his information, i.e., sell the asset when his signal implies that the expected value of the
asset is positive, and vice versa. Two examples explore the profitability of “technical” trading,
and show that a trader may be able to make substantial positive expected profit even if he has
no information about the value of the asset, provided there is at least one other (“fundamental”)
trader who does, and provided that the technical trader has information about the demand from
liquidity traders or about the mistakes of the fundamental trader. Our last set of examples shows

3

how equilibrium trading and outcomes depend on the amount of private information available to
the market maker (beyond the aggregate market demand), and in particular shows that having a
market maker observe a particular signal is not equivalent to having that signal observed publicly.
This distinction plays an important role for the last result of the paper, which characterizes
the informational properties of prices in a “hybrid” case: some information is available only to
a small number of traders (“scarce” information), while some other information is available to a
large number of traders (“abundant” information). As the number of traders having access to
“abundant” information becomes large, the equilibrium converges to the one that would obtain if
these traders were not present in the market at all, and instead their information was observed by
the market maker (but not by the remaining strategic traders, who continue to observe “scarce”
information).
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss related literature.
In Section 3, we present the model. In Section 4, we state and prove our first main result, on the
existence and uniqueness of linear equilibrium, and characterize this equilibrium analytically. In
Section 5, we illustrate our result with several applications in informationally complex settings.
In Section 6, we present our second main result, on information aggregation in large markets.
In Section 7, we explore the “hybrid” case in which some information is “scarce” and some is
“abundant.” Section 8 concludes.

Related Literature

The literature on strategic foundations of information aggregation and revelation in markets goes
back to Wilson (1977), who considers an auction-based model in which multiple partially informed
agents bid on a single object. Other work in this tradition includes Milgrom (1981), Pesendorfer
and Swinkels (1997), Kremer (2002), and Reny and Perry (2006). These papers find that under
various suitable conditions, information does get aggregated (and revealed in winning bids) when
the number of bidders becomes large. However, these results depend critically on strong symmetry
assumptions on the bidders’ signals and strategies.
Another related stream of literature, going back to Kyle (1989), considers equilibria in demand and supply functions, where bidders specify how many units of an asset they demand or
supply for each possible price level, and then the market maker picks the price that clears the
market.3 The papers in this tradition also assume a very high degree of symmetry among the
trading agents, typically assuming that these agents are ex ante identical, receive symmetrically
distributed information, and employ identical strategies in equilibrium. A recent paper by Rostek
and Weretka (2012) partially relaxes this symmetry assumption, and replaces it with a somewhat
weaker “equicommonality” assumption on the matrix of correlations among the agents’ values. This
assumption states that the sum of correlations in each column (or, equivalently, each row) of the
correlation matrix is the same, and that the variances of all traders’ values are also the same. While

this assumption is more general than full symmetry among the agents, it is still quite restrictive: for
example, the equilibrium in this model is still symmetric, with all traders using identical strategies.
Finally, a closely related stream of literature is the work building on Kyle’s (1985) model. In
that literature, as in our paper, one or more strategic traders, fully or partially informed about the
value of the traded asset, are present in the market. These strategic traders submit market orders
to centralized market makers. There are also liquidity traders who submit exogenously determined
market orders. The market makers set the price of the asset equal to their Bayesian estimate
of its value, given their prior information, the knowledge of strategic traders’ strategies, and the
observed order flow. Our paper borrows much of its analytical framework from this literature.
The key difference is that while many of the papers in this area consider both static and dynamic
models of trading but place restrictive assumptions on the information structure, our paper places
virtually no restrictions on the information structure (beyond joint normality), and focuses on the
one-period model of trading and on the informational properties of prices as the number of strategic
traders becomes large.
In the original model of Kyle (1985), there is only one informed trader, who knows the value of
the asset. Holden and Subrahmanyam (1992) study a generalization with multiple fully informed
traders. Foster and Viswanathan (1996) further extend the model by allowing these traders to
observe imperfect signals about the value of the asset. Different traders may observe different
signals, but the distribution of these signals across the traders has to be symmetric, as are the
traders’ strategies. Back et al. (2000) consider a continuous-time analog of the model of Foster
and Viswanathan (1996). Caballé and Krishnan (1994) and Pasquariello (2007) consider multiasset versions of the one-period model with multiple traders, but still maintain the assumption of
symmetry of information among the traders.
Several papers go beyond the fully symmetric case. Foster and Viswanathan (1994) consider
a model with two strategic traders in which one trader is strictly more informed than the other.
Colla and Mele (2010) consider a model in which informed traders are located on a circle, with
the correlations of signals being stronger for traders who are closer to each other (in this model,
as in the Rostek and Weretka (2012) model discussed above, all traders use identical strategies
in equilibrium). Bernhardt and Miao (2004) consider a model with a very general information
structure, allowing, as our paper does, for an asymmetric covariance matrix of traders’ signals.4
However, while Bernhardt and Miao (2004) characterize necessary and sufficient conditions for
linear equilibria, and use these conditions to study the properties of such equilibria analytically
and numerically in some specific examples, they do not provide any general results on equilibrium
existence or uniqueness and do not provide general closed-form equilibrium characterizations.
Finally, there are several papers building on the Kyle (1985) framework in which the information
4

There are several differences between the models. Unlike Bernhardt and Miao (2004), we allow liquidity demand
to be correlated with the value of the asset and/or the signals of informed traders. We also allow the market maker
to observe signals correlated with the value of the security, the demand from noise traders, and/or the signals of
informed traders. Finally, we do not impose any special structure on how the informed traders’ signals are related
to the value of the asset (and other random variables in the model), beyond joint normality. On the other hand,
Bernhardt and Miao (2004) consider a model with multiple trading periods, while we restrict attention to one period.

structure is not limited to strategic traders observing signals about the value of the asset. In Jain
and Mirman (1999), the market maker receives a separate informative signal about the value of
the asset, in addition to simply observing the aggregate order flow. In Rochet and Vila (1994)
and Foucault and Lescourret (2003), some of the strategic traders observe informative signals
about the amount of liquidity demand.5 These features of the information structure are naturally
incorporated in our general model. Hence, our equilibrium existence and uniqueness result, as well
as the characterization we derive, provide a unified approach with closed-form solutions to various
models that include these features. In Section 5, we provide a number of applications illustrating
the flexibility of our general model, and its ability to naturally incorporate such features as the
market maker receiving a signal about the value of the asset and the strategic traders observing
signals about liquidity demand, among others.

Model

There is a security traded in the market, whose value v is not initially known to market participants.
There are n strategic traders, i = 1, . . . , n. Prior to trading, each strategic trader i (he) privately
observes a multidimensional signal θi ∈ Rki , where ki ≥ 1 is the dimensionality of the signal.
For convenience, we will denote by θ = (θ1 ; θ2 ; · · · ; θn ) the vector6 summarizing the signals of all
P
strategic traders. The dimensionality of vector θ is K = ni=1 ki . There is also a market maker
(she), who privately observes signal θM ∈ RkM , kM ≥ 0 (when kM = 0, the market maker does not
receive any signals, as in the standard Kyle (1985) model).7,8 Finally, there are liquidity traders,
whose exogenously given random demand, denoted by u, is in general not directly observed by
either the strategic traders or the market maker.
The key assumption that makes the model analytically tractable is that all of the random variables mentioned above—v, θ, θM , and u—are jointly normally distributed. Specifically, we assume
that the vector µ = (v; θ; θM ; u) is drawn randomly from the multivariate normal distribution with
expected value 0 and variance-covariance matrix Ω. The assumption that the expected value of
vector µ is equal to zero is simply a normalization that allows us to simplify the notation. We
will also assume that every variance-covariance matrix for signal θi of strategic trader i and the
variance-covariance matrix of the marker maker’s signal θM are full rank. This assumption is without loss of generality; it simply eliminates redundancies in each trader’s signals. Note that we do
not place a full rank restriction on matrix Ω itself: for instance, two different strategic traders are
5
Röell (1990), Sarkar (1995), and Madrigal (1996) also consider related models in which some agents observe
signals about liquidity demand.
6
We denote the row vector with elements x1 , . . . , xk by (x1 , . . . , xk ), and the column vector with the same elements
by (x1 ; . . . ; xk ). All vectors are column vectors unless specified otherwise.
7
Strictly speaking, θi and θM are random variables whose realizations are in Rki and RkM .
8
The multidimensionality of the traders’ and the market maker’s signals allows our model to incorporate complex
relationships among their information sets: for example, one trader can observe strictly more information than
another trader; one trader can observe the union of two other traders’ signals; some information may be common to
several players while some other information is not; and so forth. We illustrate the richness of the model with several
applications in Section 5.

allowed to have perfectly correlated signals. The only substantive restrictions that we place on
matrix Ω are as follows.
Assumption 1 At least one strategic trader receives at least some information about the value
of the security, beyond that contained in the market maker’s signal. Formally:
Cov(v, θ|θM ) 6= 0.

(1)

Assumption 2 The market maker does not perfectly observe the demand from liquidity traders.
Formally:
V ar(u|θM ) > 0.

Trading and Payoffs

After observing his signal θi , each strategic trader i submits his demand di (θi ) to the market. In
addition, the realized demand from liquidity traders, u, is also submitted to the market. The market
P
maker observes her signal θM and the total demand D = ni=1 di (θi ) + u, and subsequently sets
the price of the security, P (θM , D), based on these observations. Securities are traded at this price
P (θM , D) (with each strategic trader getting his demand di (θi ), liquidity traders getting u, and the
market maker taking the position of size −D to clear the market). At a later time, the true value
of the security is realized, and each strategic trader i obtains profit πi = di (θi ) · (v − P (θM , D)).

3.2

Linear Equilibrium

Our solution concept is essentially the same as that in Kyle (1985). We say that a profile of demand
functions di (·) and pricing rule P (·, ·) form an equilibrium if
(i) on the equilibrium path, the price P set by the market maker is equal to the expected value
of the security conditional on θM and D, given the primitives and the demand functions di (·);
and
(ii) for every player i, for every realization of signal θi , the expected payoff from submitting
demand di (θi ) is at least as high as the expected payoff from submitting any alternative
demand d0i , given the realization of signal θi , the pricing rule P (·, ·) and the profile of strategies
of other players (dj (·))j6=i .9
9
Note that condition (i) is required to hold only on the equilibrium path. In the standard Kyle (1985) model and
many of its generalizations, every observation of the market maker can be rationalized as being on the equilibrium
path, and thus this qualifier is not needed. In our case, it is in general possible that for some strategy profiles di (·),
only some realizations of aggregate demand D can be observed by the market maker if the strategic traders follow
those strategies. In such cases, by analogy with perfect Bayesian equilibrium, our definition restricts the beliefs of
the market maker on the equilibrium path, where they are pinned down by Bayes rule, and does not restrict them off
the equilibrium path. For an example in which not all realizations of aggregate demand are observed in equilibrium,
consider the following market. Value v ∼ N (0, 1). There is one strategic trader with signal θ1 who observes the value
perfectly: θ1 = v. The demand of liquidity traders is u = −v. Then in the unique linear equilibrium, the demand of
the strategic trader is equal to the value of the security, and the aggregate demand is thus always equal to zero.

Equilibrium Existence and Uniqueness

We can now state and prove our first main result.
Theorem 1 There exists a unique linear equilibrium.
The proof of Theorem 1 is in Appendix A. The notation used in the proof, as well as in some of
the subsequent sections, is given in Section 4.1 below.
The proof consists of five steps. The first two steps are fairly standard, and are essentially the
same as in the earlier literature on linear-normal equilibria: they show that if all strategic traders
follow linear strategies, then the pricing rule resulting from Bayesian updating is also linear; and
that if all strategic traders other than trader i follow linear strategies, and the market maker is
also using a linear pricing rule (with a positive coefficient βD on aggregate demand D), then the
best response of trader i is also linear and is uniquely determined by the other traders’ strategies
and the pricing rule. The substantively novel parts of the proof are the next three steps. First,
we show that the conditions derived in the first two steps allow us to express all parameters of the
pricing rule and the traders’ strategies as functions of “market depth” γ = 1/βD . Next, using that
derivation, we show that the entire system of equations from the first two steps collapses into one
quadratic equation in γ. Finally, we prove that this quadratic equation has exactly one positive
root, which concludes the proof.

Applications and Examples

In this section, we illustrate the general framework presented above with several specific applications. We first present a simple yet seemingly counterintuitive example in which a trader informed
about the value of the security trades in the direction opposite to that value. Next, we study what
happens when one of the strategic traders is informed about the demand of liquidity traders. We
conclude by analyzing several examples in which the market maker possesses private information
about the value of the security and study how this information gets incorporated into the price
of the security and how it affects equilibrium trading strategies and the sensitivity of equilibrium
prices to market demand.

5.1

Trading “Against” Own Signal

In this section, we present an example of information structure under which a trader who receives
a signal about the value of the security trades in the opposite direction: i.e., when based on his
information the value of the security is positive, he shorts the security, and when it is negative, he
buys it. Note that since our model is a one-shot game, there cannot be any incentives to do that
of the form “I will try to mislead others first, and then take advantage of the mispricing.”
Example 1 The value of the security is distributed as v ∼ N (0, 1). There are two strategic traders.
Trader 1 observes a noisy estimate of v: θ1 = v + ρ1 ξ, where ξ ∼ N (0, 1) is a random variable
11
Strictly speaking, our proof does not apply directly to the case kM = 0 since, for example, it uses the inverse of
the covariance matrix of θM . However, one can drop all terms related to θM from the proof and immediately obtain
the proof for that case. Alternatively, one can consider a model in which the market maker observes a signal that is
independent of all other random variables. The equilibrium in that model will be equivalent to one in which kM = 0.

independent of v, and ρ1 is a parameter that determines how accurate trader 1’s signal is (e.g., if
ρ1 = 0, then trader 1 observes v exactly, and if ρ1 is very large, then trader 1’s signal is not very
accurate). Trader 2 also observes a noisy estimate of v: θ2 = v + ρ2 ξ, with the same “driver” of
noise, ξ, as in trader 1’s signal, but with a potentially different magnitude of noise, ρ2 . Finally,
there is demand from liquidity traders, u ∼ N (0, 1), which is independent of all other random
variables. Formally, the resulting correlation matrix is

From the analysis and closed-form characterization in the preceding section, we know that in the
unique linear equilibrium the pricing rule is characterized by some βD > 0, and the strategies of
traders 1 and 2 are characterized by:

Thus, if ρ1 = 2ρ2 + ρ12 , trader 1 never trades, despite θ1 being informative about the value of the
security, and for ρ1 > 2ρ2 + ρ12 > 0, trader 1 always trades in the direction opposite to his signal θ1 ,
despite θ1 being positively correlated with the value of the security, v. Similarly, if ρ2 is equal to or
greater than 2ρ1 + ρ12 , then trader 2 does not trade or trades in the direction opposite to his signal.
To get the intuition behind this seemingly puzzling behavior, consider a slight variation of
Example 1.
Example 2 The value of the security is v ∼ N (0, 1). There are two strategic traders. Trader 1
observes a noisy estimate of v: θ1 = v + ξ, where ξ ∼ N (0, 1), independent of v. Trader 2 observes
ξ: θ2 = ξ. The demand from liquidity traders, u ∼ N (0, 1), is independent of all other random
variables. The resulting correlation matrix is

for some δ > 0, and thus trader 2 trades in the direction opposite to his signal. Note that in this
example, trader 2 is not informed about the value of the security: his signal ξ is independent of v.
However, he is informed about the bias in trader 1’s signal, and thus knows in which direction trader
1 is likely to “err” when submitting his demand. Thus, trader 2, by partly “undoing” this error
(i.e., trading against it), can in expectation make a positive profit, despite not having any direct
information about the value of the security. In a sense, while trader 1 trades on “fundamental”
information, trader 2 trades on “technical” information: trader 1 would be able to make money
even without having trader 2 around, but trader 2’s ability to make a profit depends critically on
having trader 1 around and on exploiting that trader’s mistake.
In Example 1, the intuition is similar. If ρ2 is large relative to 2ρ1 + ρ11 , then the main “chunk”
of trader 2’s information is about the mistake that trader 1 makes, and not about the fundamental
value of the security. This causes trader 2 to want to “undo” that mistake and trade “against” his
signal, while trader 1 continues to trade in a natural direction. When ρ2 = 2ρ1 + ρ11 , the incentives
of trader 2 to trade on “fundamental” information (the positive correlation of his signal with the
value of the security) and on the “technical” information (the positive correlation of his signal with
the mistake of trader 1) cancel out, and trader 2 ends up not trading.

5.2

Information about Liquidity Demand

In this section, we study what happens when one of the strategic traders does not know anything
about the value of the security, but is informed about the amount of liquidity trading, and compare
the equilibrium to that of the standard model without such a trader.
Example 3 The value of the security is distributed as v ∼ N (0, σvv ), and the demand from liquidity
traders is distributed as u ∼ N (0, σuu ), independently of v. There are two strategic traders. Trader
1’s signal is equal to v: θ1 = v. He is fully informed about the value of the security, just like in
the standard Kyle model. Trader 2 is uninformed about the value of the security, but has insider
information about the demand from liquidity traders: θ2 = u. Formally, the correlation matrix is

In other words, when the second strategic trader (who is informed about the demand from liquidity
traders) is present in the market, that trader “takes away” one half of that “liquidity” demand. As
a result, the first strategic trader, who knows the value of the security, trades half as much as he
would in the absence of that second trader, and the market maker’s pricing rule is twice as sensitive.
Therefore, for any realization of v and u, the price in the market with the second strategic trader
will be exactly the same as that in the market without that trader—and thus the informativeness of
prices is not affected in either direction by whether there is a trader in that market who observes the
trading flow from liquidity traders. Likewise, the expected loss of liquidity traders is also unaffected
by the presence of a trader who observes their demand. Since, by construction, the market maker
in expectation breaks even, it has to be the case that the profit of the second strategic trader comes
out of the first trader’s pocket. In fact, the second trader takes away exactly one half of the first
trader’s profit.12 Also, as in Example 2, the second trader is trading on “technical” information,
and is only able to make a profit because a “fundamental” trader is also present in the market.

5.3

Informed Market Maker

In the preceding examples, as in much of the literature, the market maker does not receive any
information other than the aggregate demand coming from strategic and liquidity traders. In
this subsection, we turn to examples in which the market maker does possess some additional
information. We show how this information affects the strategies of other traders and illustrate
the interplay between the weight the market maker places on this additional information and the
weight she places on market demand.
Our first two examples show that the equilibrium obtained when the market maker has private
information is generally not the same as when that information is publicly available (i.e., known
both to the market maker and to all strategic traders). This difference will turn out to be important
12

To see this, note that the prices in the two markets are always the same, realization by realization, while the
demand of the first strategic trader, in the presence of the second one, is exactly one half of what it would be in the
absence of that trader.

13

later in the paper, in Section 7, where we study the informativeness of prices as the sizes of some
(but not all) groups of strategic traders become large.
Example 4 The value of the security is v ∼ N (0, 1). There is one strategic trader, who observes
signal θ = v +1 . The market maker observes signal θM = v +2 . Variables 1 and 2 are distributed
normally with mean 0 and variance 1, independently of each other and of all other variables. The
demand from liquidity traders is also independently distributed as u ∼ N (0, 1). Formally, the
covariance matrix that describes this information structure is

Applying the formulas derived in Section 4, we get Σdiag = Σθθ = ΣM M = 2 and ΣθM = Σθv =
ΣM v = 1. Thus, Λ = 2 + 2 − 1/2 = 7/2, Au = 0, and Av = 2/7(1 − 1/2) = 1/7. The coefficients in
the quadratic equation for γ are a = −2/49, b = 0, and c = 1, and thus

Consider now a variation of Example 4, in which the market maker’s signal is public information
(i.e., known to both the market maker and the strategic trader).
Example 5 The value of the security is v ∼ N (0, 1). The market maker observes signal θM =
v + 2 . The strategic trader now observes two signals, θ1 = v + 1 and θ2 = v + 2 . Both 1 and 2
are normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 1, independently of each other and of all other
variables. The demand from liquidity traders is independently distributed as u ∼ N (0, 1). The

The equilibria in these two examples are substantively different: the sensitivities of the market
maker to the aggregate demand and to her own signal are different, and the sensitivity of the
strategic trader’s demand to signal θ1 is different as well. We can also compute the expected profits
that the strategic trader makes in these two markets (and thus the losses of liquidity traders): in
√
√
the first example, the expected profit is 2/7, while in the second one it is greater: 6/12. These
differences illustrate the point that having the market maker observe a signal is substantively
different from having that signal observed publicly.
Our next example considers the case in which a strategic trader’s information is strictly worse
than the information available to the market maker.
Example 6 Let ν1 , ν2 , 1 , 2 , and u be independent random variables, each distributed normally
with mean 0 and variance 1. The value of the security is v = ν1 + ν2 . The demand from liquidity
traders is u. There are two partially informed strategic traders and a partially informed market
maker. Trader 1’s signal is θ1 = ν1 + 1 . Trader 2’s signal is θ2 = ν2 + 2 . Market maker’s signal
is θM = ν2 . Note that while trader 1 possesses some “exclusive” information about the value of
the security, trader 2 does not (because ν2 is observed by the market maker, and 2 is pure noise).
Formally, the correlation matrix is

and so α2 = 0. Thus, trader 2 does not trade in equilibrium. This illustrates a more general
phenomenon: in equilibrium, a strategic trader cannot make a positive profit (and does not trade)
if his information is the same as or worse than (in the information-theoretic sense) that of the
market maker.13
Our final example considers a sequence of markets, indexed by the number of strategic traders,
m. All traders receive the same information, which is imperfectly correlated with both the value
of the asset and the market maker’s information.
Example 7 The value of the security, v, the demand from liquidity traders, u, and two information
shocks, 1 and 2 , are all distributed normally with mean 0 and variance 1, independently of each
other. There are m identically informed strategic traders and a partially informed market maker.
Each strategic trader observes a signal θ1 = v+1 . The market maker observes a signal θM = v+2 .

matrix is

not the case that the market maker simply combines the information contained in her own signal
and the additional information contained in the aggregate demand D “additively”—the interplay
between the two sources of information is more intricate, and the weight that the market maker
places on her own signal depends on the overall information structure.

the market price P set by the market maker is equal to βD

Now, fix the realization of random variables, and let the number of strategic traders, m, grow
to infinity. Then price P converges to

1

the expected value of the asset, v, conditional on the information available in the market: u is

Hence, as the number of strategic traders becomes large, their information and the information of
the market maker get incorporated into the market price with precisely the weights that a Bayesian
observer with access to all information available in the market would assign. In other words, as
the number of strategic traders becomes large, all information available in the market is aggregated
and revealed by the market price. In the next section, we show that this is not a coincidence: the
information aggregation result holds very generally.

6

Information Aggregation in Large Markets

We now turn to the second main result of our paper: the aggregation of dispersed information when
the number of traders becomes large.
Consider a sequence of markets, indexed by m = 1, 2, . . . . Every market is in the general

17

framework of Section 3. In every market, there are n groups of strategic traders, with at least
one trader in each group. Index i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, now denotes a group of traders. The size of
(m)

group i in market m is denoted by `i

. All traders in the same group i receive the same signal

θi ∈ Rki . The notation from the preceding sections carries over, except that θi now denotes the
signal common to all the traders in group i.
The covariance matrix, Ω, of vector µ = (v; θ; θM ; u) is the same for all m. The number of traders
(m)

in each group, however, changes with m: specifically, we assume that for every i, limm→∞ `i

= ∞,

i.e., all groups become large as m becomes large. We do not impose any restrictions on the rates
of growth of those groups: e.g., the sizes of some groups may grow much faster than those of other
groups.
We slightly strengthen one of the two conditions on matrix Ω made in Section 3, replacing
Assumption 2 with the following:14
Assumption 2L V ar(u|θ, θM ) > 0.
It follows from Theorem 1 that for each m, there exists a unique linear equilibrium in the
corresponding market. Let p(m) denote the random variable that is equal to the resulting price in
the unique linear equilibrium of market m.
We can now state and prove our main result on information aggregation in large markets. If the
demand from liquidity traders is positively correlated with the true value of the asset (conditional
on other signals), then prices in large markets aggregate all available information: p(m) converges
to E[v|θ, θM , u]. If the demand from liquidity traders is negatively correlated with the true value of
the asset, then prices in large markets aggregate all available information except that contained in
liquidity demand: p(m) converges to E[v|θ, θM ]. If the demand from liquidity traders is uncorrelated
with the true value of the asset, then both statements are true: p(m) converges to E[v|θ, θM , u] =
E[v|θ, θM ].

In Appendix B, we prove Theorem 2 in the special case when the covariance matrix of random
vector (θ; θM ; u) is full rank. This additional assumption guarantees that certain matrices remain
invertible in the limit as m becomes large, which in turn allows us to give a direct proof of the
theorem without technical complications. However, this special case rules out some interesting
14

Under the original Assumptions 1 and 2, the information aggregation result may not hold. To see that, consider
a modification of the example introduced in footnote 9. Value v ∼ N (0, 1). There are m strategic traders with the
same signal θ1 = v. The demand of liquidity traders is u = −v. Then in the unique linear equilibrium, the demand
of each strategic trader is equal to θ1 /m, the aggregate demand of all strategic trader is equal to θ1 = v = −u, the
aggregate demand of all traders is equal to zero, and thus the equilibrium price is also always equal to zero, for any
m. Thus, there is no information aggregation of any kind in the limit as m becomes large.

18

possibilities (e.g., one type of traders knowing strictly more than another type of traders), so in the
Online Appendix we provide the full proof of Theorem 2, which does not rely on this simplifying
assumption.
The intuition for the information aggregation result is that when the number of informed traders
of each type is large, the information of each strategic “type” has to be (almost) fully incorporated
into the market price, since otherwise each trader of that type would be able to make a non-negligible
profit, which cannot happen in equilibrium. The signal of the market maker gets incorporated into
the market price by construction. Finally, with liquidity demand, the situation is more subtle.
When liquidity demand is positively correlated with the asset value (Cov(u, v|θ, θM ) > 0), equilibrium strategies and market depth adjust precisely in a way that makes liquidity demand get
incorporated into the market price “correctly,” i.e., with the same weight as it would be incorporated into the market price by a Bayesian observer who was fully informed about all the random
variables in the model (except value v). As a result, price p(m) converges to E[v|θ, θM , u], and so all
information available in the market is incorporated into the market price. However, when liquidity demand is negatively correlated with the value of the asset (Cov(u, v|θ, θM ) < 0), this cannot
happen. In equilibrium, aggregate demand always enters the market price with a positive sign (sensitivity βD is positive). Thus, liquidity demand also enters the market price with a positive sign.
However, a fully informed Bayesian observer would put a negative weight on liquidity demand—
which cannot happen in any linear equilibrium, for any parameter values. So what happens instead
as m becomes large is that the variance of the aggregate demand from informed traders grows to
infinity (in contrast to the case Cov(u, v|θ, θM ) > 0, in which it converges to a finite value). And
thus as m grows, liquidity demand u has less and less impact on the market price, and in the
limit it has no impact at all: price p(m) converges to E[v|θ, θM ]. The same happens in the case
Cov(u, v|θ, θM ) = 0, for the same reason, but in that case E[v|θ, θM ] is equal to E[v|θ, θM , u], and
so price p(m) does converge to the expected value of the asset given all the information available in
the market.

Information in “Hybrid” Markets

In many situations, some “scarce” information about the value of a security is known by only a small
number of traders, perhaps just one, while some other information, while not publicly available,
may be more “abundant,” and may be observed by a large number of traders. In this section, we
explore how these two types of information get incorporated into market prices in equilibrium.
It is intuitive that due to market impact and the resulting strategic considerations, “scarce”
information will not be fully incorporated into market prices, and the traders possessing this information will make positive profits, while “abundant” information will be almost fully incorporated
into market prices (and the traders possessing it will make vanishingly small profits). What is
less immediate is the interplay between these two types of information, and how they get combined with the information observed directly by the market maker and the information contained

19

in liquidity demand. In particular, a seemingly natural conjecture is that “abundant” information
will enter the price essentially as a public signal, observed by everyone in the economy. Our last
result shows that this is not the case: instead, “abundant” information, in the limit, enters into
market prices in the same way as if it were directly observed by the market maker—but not by
the strategic traders observing “scarce” information. As Examples 4 and 5 in Section 5 illustrate,
this is substantively different from the case in which “abundant” information is observed by all the
agents in the economy.
Formally, using the notation introduced in Section 6, suppose that for some s ≥ 1, the sizes
(m)

of the groups i = 1, . . . , s < n remain constant as m varies, i.e., `i
i = s + 1, . . . , n, the size of group i grows to infinity, i.e.,

(m)
`i

= `i for some `i , while for

→ ∞. We will refer to groups

i = 1, . . . , s as “small groups,” and to groups i = s + 1, . . . , n as “large groups.”
Let θS be the vector of signals of the small groups, i.e., θS = (θ1 ; . . . ; θs ), and let θL be the
vector of signals of the large groups, i.e., θL = (θs+1 ; . . . ; θn ). We make two assumptions:
Assumption 1H

Cov(v, θS |θL , θM ) 6= 0.

Assumption 2H

Matrix V ar((θS ; θL ; θM ; u)) is positive definite.

The first assumption states that at least one of the small groups has some information about the
value of the asset that is not included in the information of the large groups or in the information
observed by the market maker. This assumption is substantive: if the information available to the
small groups was fully subsumed by the information available to the large groups and the market
maker, then instead of the result below, the information aggregation results of the Section 6 would
hold. The second assumption is for simplicity of exposition; it is analogous to the simplifying
assumption made in the special case of Theorem 2 in Appendix B, and serves the same purpose.
Our last result shows that under Assumptions 1H and 2H, equilibrium prices in the above
sequence of markets converge to the equilibrium price that would obtain in an alternative market,
in which only the small groups of traders are present (with the same information as in the original
markets, θS ), and in which the market maker observes both her original signal θM and the signals
observed by the large groups of traders in the original markets, θL . Let p(alt) denote the random
variable that corresponds to the equilibrium price obtained in this alternative market.

Theorem 3 limm→∞ E p(m) ((θS ; θL ), θM , u) − p(alt) (θS , (θM ; θL ), u)

The proof of Theorem 3 is in Appendix C. The techniques used in the proof are similar to those
used in the proofs of Theorem 2 in the special and general cases, except that the presence of small
groups requires a separate treatment, since for the traders in those groups, strategic incentives do
not vanish in the limit. Also, note that unlike in Theorem 2, the statement of Theorem 3 does not
depend on the sign of the covariance of liquidity demand with the other random variables in the
model.

We conclude this section with a final observation. As we saw in Examples 4 and 5 in Section 5,
the expected profit of an informed agent is higher when he also observes the signal of the market
maker than when he does not. Since in the case of “hybrid” markets, equilibria converge to those
that would obtain if the information of “large” groups was observed by the market maker, but
not publicly, and since individual agents in these “large” groups make vanishingly small profits,
there will be strong incentives for trading information: by buying information from one of the
agents in a large group (say, j), a trader in a small group (say, i) can substantively increase his
expected profit, while the resulting decrease in the profit of agent j is vanishingly small, simply
because his original, “pre-trade” profit was small. Thus, “abundant” information may in fact end
up being essentially publicly observed, but only via “external” trade in information rather than via
the trading mechanism itself. We leave the formal analysis of this intuition to future research.

Conclusion

This paper studies trading behavior and the properties of prices in informationally complex markets. Our framework generalizes the single-period version of the linear-normal model of Kyle (1985),
allowing for multiple differentially informed strategic traders and for essentially arbitrary correlations among the random variables involved in the model: the value of the traded asset, the signals
of the strategic traders and competitive market makers, and the demand from liquidity traders.
In this framework, we establish two main results.
First, we show that there always exists a unique linear equilibrium. We characterize the equilibrium analytically, with the agents’ equilibrium behavior expressed in closed form. This characterization makes the framework very convenient for modeling various applied issues in informationally
complex settings. We illustrate the result and the equilibrium characterization in a series of examples.
Second, we explore the informational properties of equilibrium prices as the number of informed
agents becomes large. Our general framework allows us to avoid imposing the usual symmetry
restrictions that are typically made in the literature on the strategic foundations of information
aggregation in large markets. Instead, we assume that there are several distinct types of agents, with
agents of the same type receiving the same information, and fix the matrix of correlations of signals
across the types (and other random variables in the model), imposing essentially no restrictions
on this matrix. We then allow the numbers of agents of every type to grow (without restricting
the rates of growth in any way). We find that the informational properties of prices in these large
markets depend on the informativeness of the demand from liquidity traders. If the demand from
liquidity traders is uncorrelated with the true value of the asset or is positively correlated with it
(conditional on other signals), then prices in large markets aggregate all available information. If,
however, the demand from liquidity traders is negatively correlated with the true value of the asset,
then prices in large markets aggregate all available information except that contained in liquidity
demand. Finally, in the “hybrid” case, in which only some groups of traders become large, the

21

information of these large groups also gets fully incorporated into market prices: in the limit, the
equilibrium in the “hybrid” case is equivalent to the equilibrium of an alternative market in which
there are no traders of these large types, and instead all their information is observed directly by
the market maker.

Appendix A: Proof of Theorem 1
The proof of Theorem 1 is constructive. For convenience, it is broken into several steps. Step 1
expresses the linear relationship implied by condition (i) of the definition of equilibrium, that price
must be equal to the expected value of the security conditional on the information available to
the market maker. Step 2 derives the best response of a strategic trader to a linear pricing rule
and linear strategies of other strategic traders, and shows that this best response is linear. It also
establishes that in equilibrium, coefficient βD has to be positive. Step 3 summarizes the equations
in Steps 1 and 2 and reorganizes them in a system of three “almost” linear equations (they are all
linear if one scalar variable, γ = 1/βD , is fixed). Step 4 reduces this system of equations to one
quadratic equation in γ. Step 5 shows that this quadratic equation has exactly one positive root,
thus completing the proof.
Step 1.

Let α = (α1 ; . . . ; αn ) be a profile of linear strategies for the strategic traders. Each αi in

this profile is a vector (αi1 ; . . . ; αiki ) ∈ Rki , corresponding to linear strategy
di (θi ) = αi1 θi1 + · · · + αiki θiki ,
where θi1 , . . . , θiki are the elements of vector θi ∈ Rki .
Take any linear pricing rule (βM ; βD ), βM ∈ RkM , βD ∈ R. For convenience, let vector β =
(βM ; βD ) summarize the pricing rule and let random vector η = (θM ; D = αT θ + u) denote the
information available to the market maker when she sets the price. Then for this pricing rule to be
consistent with profile α, condition (i) of the definition of equilibrium requires that
β T η = E[v|η],
which is equivalent to the following condition:15
Cov(v, η) = β T V ar(η).
Expressing Cov(v, η) and V ar(η) using the notation introduced in Section 4.1, we thus get the
following equivalent characterization of condition (i) of the definition of equilibrium:

To see the equivalence, note first that β T η = E[v|η] =⇒ Cov(v, η) = Cov(E[v|η], η) = Cov(β T η, η) = β T V ar(η).
To go in the opposite direction, note that Cov(v, η) = β T V ar(η) = Cov(β T η, η) =⇒ Cov(v − β T η, η) = 0. Since
variables v − β T η and η are jointly normal, Cov(v − β T η, η) = 0 implies that they are independent, and thus for every
realization ηe of random variable η, E[v − β T η|η = ηe] = E[v − β T η] = 0, which implies that for every realization ηe,
E[v|η = ηe] = E[β T η|η = ηe] = β T ηe.

22

Step 2. We now consider the optimization problem of a strategic trader i. Suppose he observes
signal realization θei of signal θi , and subsequently submits demand d. Assuming that other traders
j 6= i follow linear strategies αj , and that the market maker follows a linear pricing rule (βM ; βD ),
the expected profit of trader i from submitting demand d when observing realization θei is equal to

where equation (10) is the standard projection/signal extraction formula, which can be used because
of the joint normality of the relevant variables. Note that d∗ is a linear function of θei , and vector
αi is uniquely determined by pricing rule (βM ; βD ) and strategies αj for j 6= i.
Step 3. It therefore follows from the arguments in Steps 1 and 2 that profile of strategies α
and pricing rule (βM ; βD ) form a linear equilibrium if and only if βD > 0 and the following two

Assumption 1 says that at least one strategic trader i has some useful information beyond that contained in the
market maker’s signal: Cov(v, θ|θM ) 6= 0.

(equivalent to condition (ii)):

Therefore, finding a linear equilibrium is equivalent to finding a positive root of equation (16).
To prove that this equation has a unique such root, we first simplify the expressions for a, b, and c.
(For the proof, it is sufficient to simplify a and c, but getting a simplified expression for b is useful
for deriving an explicit analytic characterization of the equilibrium.) Starting with a:

= V ar ((θ; u) |θM ) .
Thus,
c = V ar(ATu θ − u|θM ).
Step 5.

We will now determine the signs of coefficients a and c.

Matrix Σdiag is positive definite, by construction. Vector Av is not equal to zero: matrix
Λ−1

is positive definite, and vector Σθv − ΣθM Σ−1
M M ΣM v = Cov(θ, v|θM ) is not equal to zero

(by Assumption 1 of the model). Thus, a = −ATv Σdiag Av < 0.
To determine the sign of coefficient c, recall that we have shown in Step 4 that c = V ar(ATu θ −
u|θM ). So if we show that c 6= 0, it will immediately follow that c > 0.
If Au = 0, then c 6= 0 follows from Assumption 2 of the model (which says that the market
maker does not perfectly observe liquidity demand: V ar(u|θM ) > 0).
Suppose Au 6= 0. It is convenient to introduce an auxiliary random variable, φ, drawn randomly
from the normal distribution with mean zero and covariance matrix Σdiag , independent of all other
random variables in the model. Note that matrix Au now has a simple interpretation:
Au = V ar(θ + φ|θM )−1 Cov(θ, u|θM ) = V ar(θ + φ|θM )−1 Cov(θ + φ, u|θM ).
Let  = u − ATu (θ + φ). Then c = V ar( + ATu φ|θM ). To show that c 6= 0, it is thus sufficient to
show that  + ATu φ is not constant, conditional on θM . To show that, consider Cov( + ATu φ, ATu (θ +
φ)|θM ) = Cov(, ATu (θ + φ)|θM ) + Cov(ATu φ, ATu (θ + φ)|θM ).
First, Cov(, ATu (θ + φ)|θM ) = Cov(u − ATu (θ + φ), ATu (θ + φ)|θM ) = Cov(u, θ + φ|θM )Au −
ATu V ar(θ + φ|θM )Au = 0.
Second, Cov(ATu φ, ATu (θ + φ)|θM ) = V ar(ATu φ|θM ) = ATu Σdiag Au , which is not equal to zero,
because Au 6= 0 and Σdiag is positive definite. Therefore, Cov( + ATu φ, ATu (θ + φ)|θM ) 6= 0, and
thus  + ATu φ is not constant conditional on θM , and so c > 0.
Thus, a < 0, c > 0, and hence equation (16) has exactly one positive root. Therefore, there

26

exists a unique linear equilibrium.

Appendix B: Proof of Theorem 2 (Special Case)
In this Appendix, we prove Theorem 2 in the special case in which the covariance matrix of random
vector (θ; θM ; u) is full rank. In the Online Appendix, we provide the full proof of Theorem 2,
without making this simplifying assumption.
Step 1. Consider first a specific market m, and, for convenience, drop superscript (m). We know
there exists a unique linear equilibrium. It then has to be the case that in this equilibrium, any
two strategic traders in the same group have the same linear strategy (otherwise, by swapping the
strategies of these two traders, we would be able to obtain a different linear equilibrium). Denote
by αi the aggregate demand multiplier, in equilibrium, of group i; i.e., given signal θi , each trader
in the group submits demand

`i α i θ i .

With this notation, note that the expression for condition (i) in Step 3 of the proof of Theorem 1—the market maker’s inference given her information—remains unchanged, and equations (13)
and (14) remain unchanged as well. The expression for condition (ii)—the best response of a strategic trader—is now slightly different. In this new notation, it becomes: for all i,

Appendix C: Proof of Theorem 3
Step 1. In addition to the markets indexed m = 1, 2, . . . , we consider the alternative market
which includes s groups of traders i = 1, . . . , s. The size of group i is `i and each trader of group
i receives signal θi . In this alternative market, the market maker receives signal (θL ; θM ). We use
superscript (m) to refer to the variables in the market (m), and superscript (alt) for the variables
in the alternative market. We know from Theorem 1 that unique linear equilibria exist, both in
the the sequence of markets, and in the alternative market.

We could proceed by showing various convergence results directly, by matrix manipulation, as
in the proof of the special case of Theorem 2 in Appendix B. However, it turns out that the proof
becomes simpler and more intuitive if instead we follow the methodology of the proof of the general
case of Theorem 2 in the online appendix, introduce auxiliary random variables, and interpret
various matrices in the proof as covariance matrices of various combinations of these auxiliary
random variables and the random variables in the model.
Specifically, for each market m, we introduce a random vector θb(m) , which is independent of
the other random variables in the model, and is distributed normally with mean 0 and covariance
b (m) . We also introduce a random vector θbS , which is independent of the other random
