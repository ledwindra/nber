Fragility of Purely Real Macroeconomic Models

ABSTRACT
Over the past thirty years, a great deal of business cycle research has been based on purely real models
that abstract from the presence of nominal rigidities, and so (at least implicitly) assume that the Phillips
curve is vertical. In this paper, I show that such models are fragile, in the sense that their implications
change significantly when the Phillips curve is even slightly less than vertical. I consider a wide class
of purely real macroeconomic models and perturb them by introducing a non-vertical Phillips curve.
I show that in the perturbed models, if there is a lower bound on the nominal interest rate, then current
outcomes necessarily depend on agents' beliefs about the long-run level of economic activity. The
magnitude of this dependence becomes arbitrarily large as the slope of the Phillips curve becomes
arbitrarily large in absolute value (closer to vertical). In contrast, the limiting purely real model ignores
this form of monetary non-neutrality and macroeconomic instability. I conclude that purely real models
are too incomplete to provide useful guides to questions about business cycles. I describe what elements
should be added to such models in order to make them useful.

Introduction

In the wake of the classic papers by Kydland and Prescott (1982) and Long and Plosser
(1983), a great deal of macroeconomic research has focused on the implications of
purely real models. By construction, such models abstract from nominal rigidities
and so the adjustment of the price level to shocks is (at least implicitly) treated as
instantaneous. Put another way, in these models, the Phillips curve is vertical, as
the predicted level of economic activity is thought to be consistent with any level of
inflation. Presumably, this class of models is intended to provide useful approximations
to a more complicated real world, in which the price level adjusts (possibly very) rapidly
but not instantaneously.
In this paper, I demonstrate that this presumption is wrong. I consider a wide
class of purely real models. I perturb them by assuming that the adjustment of the
price level is only approximately instantaneous, so that the Phillips curve is almost,
but not exactly, vertical. I show that, if the nominal interest rate is pegged, then the
perturbed models’ predictions for current economic activity are radically di↵erent from
those of the original purely real models. In particular, in the perturbed models, current
economic outcomes are highly sensitive to agents’ beliefs about the long run level of
economic activity. The degree of this sensitivity becomes arbitrarily large as the slope
of the Phillips curve gets arbitrarily large in absolute value, even though there is no
such feedback from the future to the present in the limiting (original) model with a
vertical Phillips curve. I conclude that the predictions of a purely real macroeconomic
model are highly fragile to apparently small deviations in assumptions about price level
adjustment.
This result is seemingly paradoxical. But the intuition behind it is simple. Consider
a model in which the price level does adjust immediately and the same model perturbed
so that the price level adjusts nearly instantaneously. Imagine that, at some point in
time, there is a gap between the outcomes of the two models. With near-instantaneous
2

price level adjustment in the perturbed model, then the agents in that model will expect
the gap to shrink rapidly. But this means that if agents expect there to be a gap - even
a small one - in the long run, the current gap must be very large. It follows that in
models with near-instantaneous adjustment of the price level, current outcomes are
highly dependent on the agents’ beliefs about long-run outcomes.
The above logic relies on the assumption that the nominal interest rate is pegged.
The fragility result disappears if we restrict the central bank to use an active monetary
policy in which the nominal interest rate changes more than one-for-one with changes in
the current inflation rate. (The intuition changes because, under active monetary policies, a gap can only exist today if agents expect that gap to be growing, not shrinking,
in the future.) However, active monetary policies are intrinsically unrealistic, because
they assume that there is no lower bound on the nominal interest rate. I show that,
if there is some lower bound on the nominal interest rate, the predictions of purely
real models are again fragile, in the sense that current outcomes are highly sensitive to
perceived downside risks to long-run economic activity.
I see the fragility result as being highly consequential for the construction of macroeconomic models. All models are necessarily approximations to reality. However, their
fragility means that purely real models are simply too incomplete to be useful in interpreting the world. In the second part of the paper, I describe four elements that we
need to add to a purely real model so that it will be sufficiently robust to be empirically
useful. First, and perhaps most importantly, the model needs to have a Phillips curve
that describes the connection between the level of real activity and inflation. Second,
the model needs to have an explicit description of the central bank’s reaction function.
Third, the model needs to a description of how fiscal policy depends on the evolution of
nominal variables. Finally, the model needs to include a description of how households
form their expectations of long-run equilibrium outcomes, and how policy choices can

3

influence those expectations.1
The class of models that I consider has two distinctive features relative to the
models usually analyzed in the literature. First, I use a somewhat unusual formulation
of the Phillips curve, in which the current marginal utility of consumption, averaged
across agents, is related to the current rate of inflation.2 In some special cases, this
formulation is the same as more usual ones that connect output or employment to
inflation and expectations of future inflation. More generally, though, the formulation
in this paper allows for a clearer connection between goods and asset markets.
The second (and more important) distinctive feature is that the models are finite
horizon. This feature matters a great deal for the results. Infinite horizon models typically impose tight implicit restrictions on long run outcomes. These implicit restrictions
mean that the models are unable to capture the dependence of current outcomes on long
run outcomes that occurs in models with long, but finite, horizons. This dependence
lies at the core of my analysis.
Mathematically, my paper is related to recent work using New Keynesian models
to study the impact of a zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate. Werning
(2012) and Cochrane (2015) both consider the impact of price flexibility on equilibrium
outcomes at the zero lower bound. As I do, Werning (2012) proves that the behavior
of equilibrium outcomes is very di↵erent when prices adjust almost instantaneously,
as opposed to literally instantaneously. Cochrane (2015) shows that this discontinuity
result disappears if agents’ post-zero lower bound expectations vary appropriately with
the degree of price flexibility. Del Negro, Giannoni, and Patterson (2013), McKay,
Nakamura, and Steinsson (2015) and Werning (2015) show that economic outcomes at
the zero lower bound are highly sensitive to the central bank’s forward guidance about
interest rates in the distant future.

See Garcia-Schmidt and Woodford (2015) for one approach along these lines.
In an appendix, I describe how the main results can be generalized to allow the current inflation
rate to depend on expectations of future inflation.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, I describe a
large class of finite horizon real model economies. Then, I explain how to add a Phillips
curve to these models. I next examine the properties of equilibrium outcomes when
the Phillips curve is near-vertical. Finally, I discuss the implications of the results, in
terms of what ingredients are needed in models if they are to be non-fragile.

Real Models

I consider a class of real models in which time is discrete and indexed 1, 2, ..., T. All
agents in the economy live for T periods, and are indexed by

in a set

. A real model

has four components: (X, M, , g). The first two components (X, M ) are sets, and the
last two components are mappings between the sets:

: M !X

(1)

g : X!M

(2)

I impose no restrictions on the set X. A typical element x in X is a description of
economic characteristics. The flexibility in the specification of X means that it can
include, for example, the laws of motion of the aggregate capital stock, the crosssectional distribution of wealth, or labor market matches.
The set M is more specific. Let (⌦, F, Pr) be a probability space and (Ft )Tt=1 be a
filtration of F. The filtration is intended to represent the information encoded in the
history of aggregate shocks that have a↵ected the economy, including potential sunspots.
Let M be a set of all m such that:
T
m : ⌦ ! R+

mt is Ft -measurable

5

(3)

(Here, R+ represents the set of positive real numbers.) I view the typical element m in
M as being an average marginal utility stochastic process. More particularly, let M Ut ( )
represent agent ’s marginal period 0 utility3 of additional units of a fixed consumption
bundle c in period t. This marginal utility M Ut ( ) is random and may not be the same
for all

. Define mt to be the average of M Ut ( ) over

. This cross-sectional average

is assumed to be measurable with respect to Ft (the history of aggregate shocks).
An equilibrium to a real model (X, M, , g) is defined to be (xREAL , mREAL ) in
X ⇥ M such that:
(mREAL ) = xREAL

(4)

g(xREAL ) = mREAL

(5)

I focus on real models (X, M, , g) in which an equilibrium exists and in which that
equilibrium is unique.
Economically, I think of the average marginal utility process mREAL as being a
description of the evolution of aggregate (consumption) demand. (Aggregate demand
is high in dates and states in which mREAL is low, and vice versa.) In an equilibrium,
an aggregate demand process mREAL generates an economic outcome xREAL that is, in
turn, consistent with that same average marginal utility process mREAL . The second
equilibrium restriction is, essentially, Say’s Law: the structure xREAL of production and
consumption in the economy generates sufficient aggregate demand mREAL to clear
markets.
The following example illustrates how this abstract formulation works. Note that,
while the example assumes the existence of a representative agent, the overall framework
makes no such assumption.
Example 1. Consider a T period representative agent model with capital accumulation.
3

The definition of mt implies that it equals
time-additive preferences.

t 0

u (ct ), in models with a representative agent with

6

Agents have log utility with a discount factor . In this example, X contains stochastic
processes for consumption (ct )Tt=1 , capital (kt )Tt=11 , and output (yt )Tt=1 that are adaptable
to a filtration (Ft )Tt=1 . The initial level of capital is fixed at k1⇤ . Output is produced using
capital and labor as inputs; the efficient level of labor nt is normalized to 1. The mapping
from stochastic processes for mt to X is then defined (recursively) by:

ct =
kt =

↵E(kt+1 ct 1 /ct |Ft 1 ) + ↵ct 1

yt = (ct + kt+1

Note that this definition of

)kt ), t = 1, .., T , where k1 = k1⇤

(7)
(8)

implies the usual first order conditions for a T period

representative agent model with capital accumulation:

ct + kt+1 = kt (1

) + ↵yt /kt )
|Ft 1 ), t = 2, ..., T
ct

(10)

kT +1 = 0

(11)

k1 = k1⇤

(12)

The mapping g is defined by setting output equal to its efficient level Akt↵ in every date
and state, as long as kt > 0. More formally, if Pr(kt

0 for all t = 1, ..., T ) = 1, then:

t

gt (c, k, y) =

(1

)kt + Akt↵

kt+1

, t = 1, .., T, where kT +1 = 0

(13)

Otherwise, gt (c, k, y) = 0 for any (t, c, k, y) (so that a negative value of k is inconsistent
with equilibrium). 4
The following concepts will prove useful in the ensuing discussion. First, I define
the period t (gross) natural real interest rate as:

7

rtN AT =

mREAL
t
E{mREAL
t+1 |Ft }

(14)

Note that rtN AT is Ft -measurable. As well, I define the natural risk-neutral probability
measure QN AT to be:
QN AT (A) = E{r1N AT ...rTN AT
1

mREAL
T
1A }
mREAL
1

(15)

where A is any element of the space F of events. I assume that QN AT is absolutely
continuous with respect to the physical probability measure Pr. It is readily shown
that, if zt+1 is Ft+1 -measurable, then the QN AT -expectation of zt+1 , conditional on Ft ,
is given by:

Models with a Phillips Curve

I now describe a way to convert an arbitrary real model to a model with money and a
simple Phillips curve, meant to capture the e↵ects of sluggish price level adjustment.

3.1

Monetary Policy and Fiscal Policy

Each agent is given M dollars at the beginning of period 1. I let pt denote the price
level - that is, the price of the consumption bundle c in terms of dollars. I let ⇡t denote
the gross rate of inflation pt /pt 1 . The gross rate of return on money is governed by
an interest rate rule R that depends on the (gross) inflation rate in period t and on
the natural real interest rate in period t. More specifically, money pays a gross rate of
return R(⇡t , rtN AT ) (in dollars) in period t = 2, ..., T.
Fiscal policy is quite simple. There is no initial government debt, so that the only
initial outstanding government liability is money. In period T, agents pay a lump sum

8

tax equal to M [

T
Q

s=2

R(⇡s , rsN AT )]. This lump sum tax extracts all of the outstanding

money in the economy. It serves to give money its value in earlier periods. Note
that this form of fiscal policy is Ricardian, in the sense that the government’s budget
constraint is satisfied for any sequence of equilibrium price levels.4

3.2

Aggregate Euler Equations

Money is an asset. If agents are to be marginally indi↵erent about further exchanges
of c for money, then the price level (the reciprocal of money’s asset price) has to obey
a set of aggregate Euler equations:
mt /pt = R(⇡t , rtN AT )E(mt+1 /pt+1 |Ft ), t = 1, ..., (T

1)

(17)

This first order condition assumes that no agent faces a binding borrowing constraint
with respect to money. The formulation of fiscal policy, which requires all agents to
hold sufficient wealth at each date to know that they will be able to pay their taxes in
the final period, implies that this assumption is valid in equilibrium.

3.3

Inverse Phillips Curves

I now add a set of short-term inverse Phillips curves to the model. They describe how
deviations in the current and future inflation rates, from a benchmark gross inflation
rate ⇡ ⇤ , are associated with deviations of aggregate economic activity from the equilibrium level in the real model. I use the average marginal utility of c as the measure
and
of aggregate economic activity. More specifically, I define m
b t to be mt /mREAL
t
4

This model of monetary policy is motivated by the current situation of the Federal Reserve. As
of this writing, banks hold a large amount of excess reserves and the Federal Reserve intends to
a↵ect financial market conditions by varying the interest rate on those reserves. It is traditional
in macroeconomics to assume instead that the central bank influences the short-term interest rate by
exchanging non-interest-bearing (relatively liquid) bank reserves for interest-bearing (relatively illiquid)
short-term government debt. The results in the paper rely only on the specification of the aggregate
Euler equation and so would generalize to this more traditional (but more complicated) model.

9

⇡
bt = ⇡t /⇡ ⇤ and define the inverse Phillips curves to be:

where

⇡t ; ), t = 1, ..., T
m
b t = h(b

0.

(18)

I impose the following restrictions on h. I assume that h is twice continuously differentiable with respect to , and that:

h(b
⇡ ; 0) = 1

(19)

As we will see, this restriction corresponds to assuming that prices adjust instantaneously when

= 0. More substantively, I assume that, if inflation equals the bench-

mark ⇡ ⇤ , then aggregate economic activity lines up with that in the real model.

h(1; ) = 1 for any

0, t = 1, ..., T

(20)

This restriction links the model with price rigidities back to the original real model.
The final assumptions about h deal with the association of inflation and economic
activity. I assume that, if

> 0, the function h is strictly decreasing in ⇡
b. This

assumption implies that if inflation is above the benchmark level today, then aggregate
economic activity is above its equilibrium level (so that m
b is low). I assume too that h
satisfies Inada conditions:

⇡ ; ) = 1 if
lim h(b

⇡
b!0

⇡ ; ) = 0 if
lim h(b

⇡
b!1

Intuitively, the parameter

>0
>0

(21)
(22)

governs the elasticity of the Phillips curve (drawn with ⇡

on the vertical axis and m on the horizontal axis). Thus, when

10

= 0, m is independent

of ⇡. This is a situation in which the inverse Phillips curve is horizontal, and the Phillips
curve is vertical.. When

is near zero, the di↵erentiability assumption that I made

about h ensures that the slope of the inverse Phillips curve is nearly zero, so that
the Phillips curve is nearly vertical. The main point in this paper is that equilibrium
outcomes are very di↵erent when the Phillips curve is nearly vertical as opposed to
vertical.

3.4

Normalized Aggregate Euler Equations

It will be useful to rewrite the aggregate Euler equations in terms of the deviations m
b
and ⇡
b from the original real equilibrium mREAL and the benchmark gross inflation rate

⇡ ⇤ . We can rewrite the aggregate Euler equations as follows:
b ⇡t , rN AT )E N AT (

Basic Properties of Equilibrium

In this section, I describe the basic properties of equilibrium in a model with nominal
rigidities. In models with a vertical Phillips curve, all equilibria have the same real
allocation of resources as the original, real, economy. In models with a non-vertical
Phillips curve, there is a continuum of equilibrium real allocations, indexed by the
(random) rate of inflation in the final period T on which agents co-ordinate.

a non-vertical Phillips curve (

Regardless of whether the Phillips curve is vertical or not, there is a continuum of
equilibria. The set of equilibria is indexed by the (random) final period inflation rate
on which agents co-ordinate. When the Phillips curve is vertical, real allocations are
the same in all of these equilibria. When the Phillips curve is non-vertical, the di↵erent
inflation rate processes translate into di↵erent real allocation processes.

Equilibria Under Di↵erent Interest Rate Rules

In this section, I show how the nature of equilibrium depends on the nature of the
interest rate rule used by the central bank.

5.1

Interest Rate Peg

I first consider an interest rate peg, in which the nominal interest rate evolves so as
to be equal to the sum of the inflation target ⇡ ⇤ and the natural real interest rate
rtN AT . (I refer to this policy rule as a peg, because the evolution of the nominal interest
rate R over time is independent of any variables a↵ected by monetary policy.) This
specification of monetary policy implies that if households believe that inflation equals

14

⇡ ⇤ in the long run, then the real outcomes in any model with price rigidities are same
as those in the real model.

(45)

More generally, though, there is no reason why agents should believe that inflation
will in fact equal ⇡ ⇤ in the long run. The next proposition shows that current economic
outcomes are highly sensitive to beliefs about long-run economic activity when the
Phillips curve is nearly vertical. In reading the proposition, recall that h is the inverse
Phillips curve. The hypothesis of the proposition imposes an upper bound on the
absolute value of the elasticity of h and this imposes a lower bound on the absolute
value of the elasticity of the Phillips curve itself.

is small. In that case, agents expect that

any current marginal utility gap (ln m
b t ) will vanish rapidly. But the contrapositive of

this statement is that, if people believe that there will still be a marginal utility gap in

many periods, the gap today must be very large. The size of the current gap is highly
sensitive to variations in agents’ beliefs about the long-run marginal utility gap. The
sensitivity is decreasing in

- that is, the current marginal utility gap is more sensitive

with respect to the long run if the Phillips curve is close to vertical.
Proposition 4 stresses a lack of continuity with respect to . However, the persistence of marginal utility gaps is continuous with respect to . When

is positive, but

near zero, agents expect a marginal utility gap at date t to shrink over time, with a
rate of contraction that is decreasing in . When

is exactly zero, then any gap dis-

appears instantaneously. It is this kind of continuity that, for example, Golosov and
Lucas (2007) have in mind when they argue that money is nearly neutral for plausible
estimates of menu costs.
The point of Proposition 4 (and this paper) is that we cannot gauge the neutrality
of money only through forward-looking metrics like the persistence of marginal utility
gaps. Indeed, it is exactly when money is nearly neutral in a forward-looking sense that
it is highly non-neutral in a backward-looking sense, so that current marginal utility
gaps are in fact highly sensitive to long-run beliefs about real outcomes. Using purely
real models will miss this latter backward-looking non-neutrality.
Following Atkeson and Ohanian (2001), a number of authors have obtained estimates indicating that, in aggregate data, the Phillips curve is nearly horizontal. If the
inverse Phillips curve h is log-linear, then this characterization corresponds to setting
the power

to be very large. The proof of Proposition 4 demonstrates that in this case,

current marginal utility gaps still depend on agents’ beliefs about long-run gaps under
an interest rate peg. However, the degree of dependence is typically much smaller when

18

b ⇡ , rN AT ) equals one (as assumed
the Phillips curve is near-horizontal. For example, if R(b

in Proposition 4) and 1/ is set equal to zero, then the marginal utility gap process is
a martingale with respect to the measure defined by QN AT . Current marginal utility
gaps respond only one-for-one to changes in beliefs about long-run gaps.

Active Interest Rate Rule

A nominal interest rate peg like that studied above is a well-known example of a passive
monetary policy rule. The next proposition shows that the fragility result does not
apply if monetary policy is active, in the sense that the nominal interest rate adjusts
more than one-for-one with changes in the inflation rate.
Proposition 5. Suppose that the inverse Phillips curve h(b
⇡; ) = ⇡

b , ) with price rigidities in which
model (X, M, R,

. Consider a

> 0 and R(b

> 1. There exists an equilibrium (xM ON , mM ON , ⇡) in which

there are two constants b < 0 and B > 0 such that:

ON

ln(mREAL

(55)

In any such equilibrium, at any date t:

 ln(mM

t

ln(mREAL
)  B[( + 1)/( + )]T t ) = 1 (56)

Proof. The existence of such an equilibrium follows trivially from Proposition 2. To
establish the rest of the proposition, we can again proceed by reverse induction. The
ON
/mREAL
for all
claim is true for t = T. Suppose it is true for t + 1, and let m

(58)

and so:
m
b t  exp(B[( + 1)/( + )]T t ) w.p. 1

(59)

We can readily prove the lower bound result in the same fashion.
With an active policy rule, both the upper and lower bounds on ln(m
b t ) converge to

zero as (T

t) converges to infinity. The key is that, with an active monetary policy

rule, a period t gap m
b t can only survive in equilibrium if agents expect an even larger

gap next period. The current gap is consequently not all that sensitive to the size of
the long-run gap.
Note that this limiting behavior with respect to (T

t) is independent of the slope

of the Phillips curve ( 1/ ). However, the rate of convergence with respect to (T
is faster when

t)

is near zero - that is, when the Phillips curve is closer to vertical. If

is near infinity (as suggested by the empirical estimates of the Phillips curve mentioned
earlier), then the rate of convergence is relatively slow. In this “nearly flat” Phillips
curve case, the dependence of m
b t on long-run economic activity can be substantial,

unless (T

t) is very large.

This proposition underscores the potential importance of monetary policy in stabilizing the macro-economy. As we have seen, under an interest rate peg, the marginal
utility gap m
b t fluctuates in response to shocks to agents’ beliefs about the long-run gap
m
b T . This problem is actually more pronounced when prices are more flexible. Active

monetary policy can eliminate the influence of the distant future on current outcomes.
It is actually more e↵ective in doing so when prices are more flexible.

5.3

Interest Rate Rule with a Lower Bound

We have seen that, if the interest rate rule is active, then the current equilibrium level
of economic activity is essentially independent of agents’ beliefs about long-run gaps.
However, any central bank that faces a lower bound on the nominal interest rate is

20

forced to follow a rule that is in some sense passive. In this subsection, I examine the
e↵ects of this kind of passivity on economic outcomes.
I prove two propositions about interest rate rules with a lower bound. The first
proposition uses a specific equilibrium selection to rationalize the claim made by some5
that the long-run level of inflation is increasing in the size of the lower bound.

The degree of sensitivity of the lower bound to both ln R

risks becomes more pronounced if

vertical). The key to this result lies in the behavior of expected inflation. Definitionally,
a near-vertical Phillips curve implies that even tiny expected future marginal utility gaps
are associated with very high rates of anticipated deflation (very negative inflation). In
this way, small long-run marginal utility gaps are associated with high real interest
rates, and large current marginal utility gaps.

5.4

Summary

When the interest rate rule takes the form of a peg, current equilibrium outcomes in
models with a near-vertical Phillips curve are highly sensitive to changes in agents’
beliefs about long-run outcomes. The degree of sensitivity is, in fact, increasing as
the Phillips curve becomes closer to vertical. An active interest rate rule can essentially eliminate this dependence on the long run. However, if the interest rate rule is
bounded from below, then current equilibrium outcomes are highly sensitive to downside shocks to beliefs about long-run economic activity. The degree of sensitivity is,
again, increasing as the Phillips curve becomes closer to vertical.
It is common in the New Keynesian literature to restrict attention to monetary
policy rules that imply that equilibrium is determinate. The above analysis suggests
that, under this restriction, current outcomes are essentially una↵ected by beliefs about
the long run. As a result, real equilibrium outcomes in a model with a near-vertical
Phillips curve will be similar to those in a model with a vertical Phillips curve. However,
this restriction on monetary policy rules seems unrealistic. Clarida, Gali, and Gertler
(2000) argue that the Federal Reserve followed a passive monetary policy rule during
1970s. As well, as long as there is an e↵ective lower bound on nominal interest rates,
the central bank is forced to follow a rule that is, in some sense, passive.
The above analysis hinges on the aggregate Euler equation, which provides a tight
24

connection between the distant future and current outcomes. As Del Negro, Giannoni
and Patterson (2013) and MacKay, Nakamura, and Steinsson (2015) have emphasized,
this tight connection implies that forward guidance is a surprisingly powerful monetary policy tool. The former authors suggest relaxing this connection by assuming
that agents’ lifetimes are, on average, shorter than the life of the economy. The latter authors suggest relaxing this connection via binding borrowing constraints. These
suggestions lead both sets of authors to use models in which the log-linearized Euler
equation features discounting, so that aggregate marginal utilities satisfy a collection
of normalized Euler equations of the form:
b t+1
b ⇡t , rN AT )E N AT ( m
|Ft ), 0 <
m
b t = R(b
t
⇡
bt+1

<1

(69)

We can readily extend the proofs of the key fragility results (Propositions 4 and 7) to
cover the case in which the Euler equations take this discounted form. It is true that
the discounting in (69) weakens the connection between current outcomes and beliefs
about the future. Nonetheless, households still expect any current marginal utility
gap to disappear exponentially quickly when the Phillips curve is near-vertical and
the interest rate rule is passive. This expectation means, again, that current marginal
utility gaps are highly sensitive to beliefs about long-run gaps.6
6

In a recent paper, Kaplan, Moll, and Violante (KMV) (2015) explore the properties of what they
term HANK (Heterogenous Agent New Keynesian) models. In these models, many households have
zero liquid assets. As a result (and as KMV emphasize), the standard intertemporal substitution forces
are much weaker. Nonetheless, I conjecture that the main fragility results in this paper (Propositions
4 and 7) would generalize to KMV’s framework. In particular, it is still true in HANK models that
when the Phillips curve is arbitrarily near-vertical (so that "/✓ is near infinity in KMV’s notation),
expectations of tiny future marginal gaps are associated with expectations of arbitrarily negative
inflation. The resulting infinitely high real interest rates will have a crushing e↵ect on consumption
demand and economic activity.

Building Useful Macroeconomic Models

The previous section shows that, for particular monetary policy regimes, the predictions
of a purely real model change dramatically if we add a slight amount of nominal frictions
to the model. These results imply that purely real models are too incomplete to provide
robust predictions about the macroeconomy. In this section, I describe four modeling
ingredients that we need to add to purely real models if they are to deliver robust
predictions: nominal rigidities, the central bank reaction function, fiscal policy, and
beliefs about long-run outcomes.

6.1

Nominal Rigidities

A model with a near-vertical Phillips curve, and a fixed interest rate, has a nearzero impulse response from current gaps to future outcomes. This kind of relationship
between the present and future is well-approximated by purely real models with a
vertical Phillips curve. However, as we have seen, a model with a near-vertical Phillips
curve predicts that current gaps are highly sensitive to information about future gaps.
Purely real models zero out this sensitivity. Hence, we can only usefully approximate
the feedback of the future to the present by using models that include an explicit
treatment of nominal rigidities.
It is probably worth emphasizing that the magnitude of this feedback is especially
dependent on the degree of nominal rigidity, as captured by the slope of the Phillips
curve, when prices are highly flexible. In this sense, the behavior of the macroeconomy
may be highly sensitive to the frequency with which firms adjust their prices.7
7

Bils and Klenow (2004) initiated a large literature that provides microeconometric estimates of
the frequency of price changes by firms. See Klenow and Malin (2011) for a survey of that literature.

26

6.2

Central Bank Reaction Function

The above argument relies on the central bank’s reaction function being a peg. With an
active reaction function, in which the interest rate moves more than one-for-one with
the inflation rate, a gap can only exist today if agents expect an even larger future gap.
In this case, as we have seen in Proposition 5, the current gap displays relatively little
sensitivity to information about the size of gaps in the distant future. Hence, accurate
models of how information about the future a↵ect current outcomes need to include
an accurate model of the central bank’s reaction function. Recently, for example, some
central banks have successfully lowered their target interest rates below zero. Relaxing
these constraints may matter for how downside long-run risk a↵ects current outcomes.

6.3

Fiscal Policy

I model fiscal policy as being Ricardian, so that the government’s budget constraint is
satisfied for any price level process. This kind of fiscal policy combined with an interest
rate peg implies that there is a large number of equilibria. As Woodford (1995) argues,
other kinds of fiscal policy can be used to winnow down the number of equilibria.8
Suppose, for example, that the government commits to exchange consumption bundles
c for money at a fixed price pt in period t, where pt = ⇡ ⇤ pt 1 . This commitment would
pin down the inflation rate at ⇡ ⇤ and eliminates the indeterminacy at the heart of this
paper. Hence, an accurate model of the feedback from the future to the present requires
an accurate model of how fiscal policy responds to the evolution of the price level.

6.4

Beliefs about Long-Run Macroeconomic Outcomes

In the class of models that I study, expectations are fully rational. Because fiscal policy
is Ricardian, there are many possible equilibria in the final period. Agents co-ordinate
on an aggregate sunspot to determine which of these equilibria get played. Over time,
8

See also Kocherlakota and Phelan (1999).

27

agents receive information about the realization of the sunspot. It is this information
that generates variation in their beliefs about long-run outcomes. As we have seen,
in models with near-vertical Phillips curves, the changes in these beliefs can have a
large influence on the evolution of equilibrium outcomes. To be useful, macroeconomic
frameworks of this kind should include accurate models of the evolution of these beliefs,
and how policy choices (or communications) might be able to a↵ect that evolution.9
Infinite horizon models are unlikely to be useful in this context. Users of infinite
horizon models focus on equilibria in which logged outcomes are finite in absolute value.
But under an interest rate peg, logged gaps are expected to shrink exponentially over
time (in absolute value). In an infinite horizon model, logged equilibrium outcomes
can only be finite in absolute value if the long-run gap is always zero.10 Focusing on
infinite horizon models, and on finite equilibria, eliminates any variation in beliefs about
long-run gaps.

7

Conclusions

George Box (1979) famously said that ”All models are wrong but some are useful.”
Over the past thirty-plus years, economists have written literally thousands of papers
that attempt to analyze macroeconomic data using purely real models. This paper is
9

As I note in the introduction, the recent work by Garcia-Schmidt and Woodford (2015) could be
potentially useful along these lines. However, it is important to supplement their purely theoretical
approach with more empirical studies of how households actually form expectations.

There is no variability in expected long-run gaps, when the model horizon is infinite.

28

not about the (well-understood) empirical point that these models are wrong. This
paper reaches a distinct theoretical conclusion: purely real models are too fragile to be
useful as a means of answering questions of interest. To take but one famous example:
Kydland and Prescott (1982) conclude that their purely real model explains about 2/3
of business cycle fluctuations. But adding even a slight amount of nominal rigidity,
in the form of a slightly non-vertical Phillips curve, would make the model’s implied
variance of output highly dependent on agents’ assessments of long-run risk. Like all
other purely real models, Kydland and Prescott’s framework ignores key sources of
monetary non-neutrality and macroeconomic instability. It is not a useful model of
output fluctuations.
How, then, do we go about building useful models? We need to take explicit account
of nominal rigidities that will give rise to non-vertical Phillips curves. We need to capture the impact of shocks and policy choices on agents’ beliefs about long-run economic
activity. We need to take explicit account of the operating frameworks of central banks
and fiscal authorities. To my knowledge, there has as yet been no research into the
empirical properties of models that have all of these elements.

Appendix
In this appendix, I describe how to extend propositions 4 and 7 to the case of a forwardlooking Phillips curve similar to that used in much of the New Keynesian literature.
Suppose that we change the normalized equilibrium condition (29) to take the form:
b t, ⇡
bt+1 ; )
⇡
bt = EtN AT H(m
bT; )
⇡
bT = HT (m

where His strictly decreasing in both arguments, HT is strictly increasing, and H(1, 1; ) =
HT (1) = 1. (Note that H and HT are Phillips curves, not inverse Phillips curves.) Sup-

29

pose too that H and HT satisfy the restrictions:

The above elasticity restrictions imply that the basic inductive logic underlying
