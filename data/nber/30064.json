    "abstract": "\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has brought renewed attention to rationing guidelines for scarce medical resources.  This paper describes the benefits of using a reserve system over a priority system in operationalizing compromises between certain ethical goals.  In the last two years, more than a dozen states and local jurisdictions have adopted reserve systems in initial phases of vaccine distribution.   We highlight several design issues arising in some of these implementations.\n\n",
