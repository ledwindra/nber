    "abstract": "\n\nA recursive algorithm for estimating linear models with both constant and time-varying parameters is derived by maximization of a likelihood function. Recursive formulas are also derived for derivatives of the likelihood function; the derivatives are needed for numerical evaluation of some parameters. Smoothing formulas are also derived. The estimation algorithm is compared with others for similar classes of models.\n\n",
