Taxes, Firm Financial Policy and the Cost of Capital:
An Empirical Analysis

ABSTRACT

This paper develops a theoretical model of firm behavior consistent
with the maximization of shareholder utility, and derives empirically

testable implications of different theories of equity finance. Using data
on firm

earnings

and previous investment and financial behavior, we assess

whether firms treat new share issues as a more expensive source of finance
than retentions, and whether such behavior varies across firms according
to the composition of their shareholders.
Our results strongly support the hypothesis that firms perceive a

higher cost of capital when issuing new shares, an that the cost of capital varies significantly across firms having different estimated tax
clienteles, as theory would predict.

INTRODUCTION

The observed financial behavior of firms,

particularly

their policy of

distributing substantial dividends in the face of unfavorable tax treatment, has

proved difficult to model in a consistent way. The basic problem is that the
simplest theoretical models dictate outcomes that are clearly at variance with

reality. This has led investigators to adopt one of three strategies in dealing
with the problem:

(i) Reality is wrong; firms

(2)

don't

really behave as we think they do.

Firms and/or investors are irrational. Firms do not act in the
true interests of their shareholders, either because shareholders
misperceive

these interests or because firms do.

(3) There are constraints, some possibly obscured from ready

identification,

that prevent rational firms

and investors from

behaving as the simple theory would have th do.
All of these positions present difficulties for their adherents, though there

may be an element of truth in each. However, the welfare
with

respect to tax changes is

very

distinct. Hence, it

roots of financial behavior be ascertained.
The purpose

of this paper is to develop a theoretical model of firm beha-

vior consistent with the maximization of shareholder utility, and derive empiri-.

cally testable implications of the different theories of equity finance outlined

below. In particular, we wish to assess, using data on firm earnings and previous

and whether such behavior varies across firms accordin8 to the corn-

of their shareholders. By using a panel of several firms observed over

years, we have the capacity to control for effects that characterize

particularly important in the current context, allowing us to overcome many of the criticisms

leveled at related efforts in the past.
We begin with a brief review of the related empirical literature in the

next section. Section III presents a discussion of the data used in the paper,
and sons summary statistics of the financial behavior of the companies in our

sample. Section IV develops a theoretical model of shareholder equilibrium and
firm behavior, and Section V adapts this model to a dynamic

context

to permit

empirical estimation. Section VI presents such empirical results and offers
some concluding commsnts,

II. Related Literature
The modern theory of financial and investnent behavior begins with the work

of Modigliani and Miller (1958, 1963) and Miller and Modigliani (1961), vI

showed that in the absence of taxes, in a rational world vitht constraints,
firm financial policy is irrelevant: neither the debt equity ratio nor the
source of new equity capital (retentions versus ned- shares) has any

the wealth

effect on

of a fix' shareholders. The presence of the corporate tax,

and

interest deductibility, leads to the result that firms sha%ld finance entire]y

with debt.
That firms do not borrow to finance all new investment has been explained
in a number of ways. l'irst of all, with personal taxes, it is the relative tax

—3—

advantage

of debt, over that enjoyed by the individual, that matters.1 Since

individuals also face a higher tax rate on debt than equity income (capital

gains being lightly taxed), the total tax advantage to debt is lower. Added to
this is the fact that, without a perfect loss offset, the expected corporate
income tax deduction for interest payments declines with leverage.2

Thus, espe-

cially in the presence of a progressive income tax structure and individuals

with different personal tax preferences for equity versus debt, tax factors need

not require all—debt finance. Two

other

costs of debt relate to bankruptcy.

Increased leverage may make bankruptcy, with potentially high social costs, more

likely. In addition, the prospect of bankruptcy in some states of the world
introduces a moral hazard to the firm's investnent decision.3

it is encouraged

to undertake risky projects it might otherwise eschew in order to decrease the

expected payment to bondholders. The higher the firm's leverage, the greater
the moral hazard and, presumably, the higher the cost to the firm of debt
finance.

Thus,

there are a number of possible reasons for observed corporate

leverage decisions, although they may not be

entirely satisfactory. Less expli-

are the dividend policies that firms fo11c-. I'bst firms pay dividends.
In the U.3. in 1981, dividends of corporations were 63.1 billion dollars,

exceeding

the 149.5

billion

dollars of earnings retained.1 Since dividends are

subject to full personal taxation, while capital gains associated with retentions are subject, in the U.S., to a 60 percent exclusion from taxation, and

theory that no one pays taxes on

is no disincentive faced by firms

Their argument was based on various aspects of the Internal

—)4 —

Revenue Code, including one that limits the use of interest deductions against
non—capital income. This argument is ingenious but refuted by empirical evi—
dence. As shown by Feenber (1981), only 2 1/2 percent of dividends received in
the U.S. in 1971 went to investors facing the limitation discussed by Miller and

Scholes, forming a rather low upper bound on the extent of such behavior. Moreover, the Miller_Scholes argument cannot even be applied to the dividend paying
behavior in countries such as the United Kingdom, where personal investors do
not have the benefit of interest deductibility.

The

"irrationality" approach may be attrilxited to the work of Black and

Scholes (1973, 197)4) and Fama (197)4), who loci, respectively, at the valuation

response of investors to dividends and the choice of the firm anxng different

sources of finance. In these empirical studies, the results are taken to imply
that firns and individuals behave as the Modigliani—Miller theory would predict
for

a taxiess world. There is

no suggestion that such behavior is

rational when

taxes are present, merely that it continues to occur. While a sanling of
investment letters and corporate reports may evoke sympathy for such a position,

it seems at variance with the general, empirically suprorted presumption that
capital markets are generally efficent and investors behave rationally.
Finally, there are the explanations of dividend behavior based on constraints. If firn are inhibited from repurchasing their own shares, or those
of

others, and therefore can only pass earnings out of the corporation as divi-

dends,

then the market

reinvested

should capitalize this fact. Since earnings retained and

must eventually be distribited, the dividend tax can never be

avoided. This will lead to firm indifference in the distribution or retention
of dividends, and to a capitalization of the dividend disadvantage in the price
of

the firm's shares.5 An important implication of this view is that the divi-

dend tax, if not anticipated, is a lump sum tax on the value of corporate

—5—

equity.

in the

A problem with this "capitalization" or "new" view

is that some firms

U.S. do repurchase their shares, and others issue new shares while con-

tinuing to distribute dividends.6
An explanation of this behavior could stan from an additional constraint

result of a signalling model (e.g., Bhattachaxya (1919)) in which firms

observed cutting their dividends are perceived to be in financial trouble.

Thus, firms might be forced to issue new shares to raise funds in periods of

high investment. This theory does not offer convincing evidence of the existence of the kind of managerial incentives needed to support such a signalling
equilibrium, but it is well known that finn dividend policy is extremely stable.

As opposed to the capitalization result, this "double taxation" or "classical"
view suggests that, since new equity source funds must come not fran dividends
but from new shares, the issue of which does not generate a reduction in current
taxes, the dividend tax will influence investmsnt, and will not be capitalized

into the value of existing equity. Another way of distinguishing between these
two views of dividend tax incidence is the long run value of Tobin's q, the

ratio of market value to asset cost for the firm. The capitalization model predicts a q below unity, reflecting the tax savings associated with investment

retention. The classical model predicts a long run q of one. The luNer
q in the first case is the mechanism through which the future dividend taxes are
through

capitalized and hence not borne by new

investnnts.1

controlling for fluctuations in the market return, stock prices drop by significantly

less than the value of the dividend, perhaps only 80

percent on

average.8 In addition, there is a significant variation in this discount
according to the dividend payout of the finn.9

that tax effects are present in the discounting of dividends, and that
investor tax clienteles exist with respect to firm dividend behavior.
indicate

While these studies have been criticized on various grounds,-0 they have an

important ]J.initation even if interpreted correctly: they tell us nothing about
the behavior of firms in response to taxes. As shown in Auerbach (1982b), the
equation

used to estimate ex dividend day effects is consistent with both the

"capitalization" view that firms obtain their equity capital through retentions,
and the "double—taxation" view that new shares provide the funds for new invest-

and dividends are fixed in the short run. In fact, one cc*ild also derive

behavior. It

occurs.

Studies of firm

tionship

behavior have focused on

among a firm's

three questions: the interrel&-.

dividend and investment policy, the reaction of a firm's

—7—

investment policy to changes in its market value, and the changes in a firm's
earnings in years following investnnts financed by different methods.
Two papers examining the first of these questions, with different conclusions, are by Dhrymes and Kurz (1961) and Fama (19714). Though the empirical

methodolo&y differs between the papers, each uses simultaneous equation methods
to ask whether changes in dividends influence investment, and whether changes in

investnnt influence dividends. As suggested by Fama, the view that taxes don't
influence firm behavior is consistent with a surge in investment causing a
reduction in dividends, since according to that view dividend policy is irrele-

vant. The key relationship involves the effect of dividends on investment.
Here, since without taxes real and financial decisions are separate, there

should be no effect. Fan finds that there is none, but Dhrymes and Kurz find
that there is a sigificantly negative effect, as would be predicted if firms

consider new shares to be more expensive for tax reasons. However, the esthna—
tion procedures differ between the studies, and one can raise serious questions

about the econometrics of each. For exan1e, Fama uses current profits and
lagged

dividends as the instruments for current dividends in the tine series

investment equation he fits separately for a large number of firms. Profits
qualifies as an instrwnent only because it is excluded frcmi the investment

equation. Yet, if dividends

over, if firms do consider retentions to be a cheaper form of finance due to tax
considerations, an increase in profits may lower the marginal cost of capital

reasons, the procedure used

would lead to an upward bias in the dividend coefficient. Indeed, one

a significant positive effect of the omitted profits variable. Thus, the
observed insignificant coefficients need not be inconsistent with the results of'

Dhrymes and Kurz.

Poterba and Summers (1981) use the q

test

model of investment as an indirect

of the "capitalization" versus the "double—tax" view of firm behavior.

Since the two theories predict different long—run values of the ratio of market

value to replacement value of assets, they predict different investment behavior
for firms that, responding optimally to costs of adjustment, set investment
equal to a function of the gap between the current value of

q. and the long—run

value of q. (Abel (1979), Hayashi (1981)). Poterba and Summers estimate an

aggregate time series q investment equation, with the q variable being a
weighted average of these corresponding to the "double—tax" and "capitalization"

theories. By estimating the weights jointly with the other parameters of the
equation,

they find that the best fit is obtained when essentially all the

weight is given to the "double-tax" q. While this result does seem damaging to

the "capitalization" view, there are a number of difficulties in interpreting
it. First of all, the "double—tax" q derived by Poterba and Summers is precisely the "no tax" q: the same expression would be obtained if all personal
taxes were zero or, in keeping with the "irrationality" hypothesis, ignored by
firms. Second, a number of assumptions, including constant returns to scale and

capital stock honxgeneity,
the estinted equations to

well as convex adjustment costs, are required for

be valid. Our empirical findings below suggest the

existence of large "firm effects" in rates of return, which is not consistent

with this view of the world. Finally, comnxn sense intervenes to remind us that
firms do not issue shares, or repurchase shares, in every or even most years)-

—9—

A third type of study

has directly estimated the

change in earnings attri-

butable to previous investment financed by different sa.irces. Bauniol

et al

(1910) used the technique, followed by others, of regressing, over a cross
section of firms, a weighted average change in earnings pins interest on an

average of previous amounts of retained earnings, debt issues and new share

issues. The rationale was that if firms face different costs of capital for
different sources of funds, they

will use

the least expensive scxirce first,

using the more expensive one if very profitable investments present themselves.

Such profitability should show up in subsequent earnings. The results of Baumol
et al suggested that new shares were a substantially more expensive source of
funds

than

retentions or debt, although taxes were not suggested by the authors

to lie behind this finding. However, the coefficients of all three independent
variables were vexy unstable over different cross sections, the exact specification estimated was not drawn from any explicit model of firm behavior, and the
estimation procedure did not control adequately for simultaneity biases

likely to be present. For these and other reasons, a number of authors criti-

cized

both the paper's methodolor and its conclusions.

Our empirical approach will extend that of Baumol et al, but with a number

of important differences. First, we beLn by devising an estimable model from
an examination of firm behavior based on the maximization of stockholder utility

in the presence of constraints. Then, using data corrected for inflation, we

use time series cross section methods in an attent to control for firm differences. The use of panel data also allows us to test for the influence of
taxes on firm behavior not only in the aggregate, but across firms according to

their tax

clientele, as dictated by the theory. The empirical results in

issuing new shares, and that the cost of capital varies signifi-

cantly across firms
sistent

having

different estimated tax clienteles, in a manner con-

with these differences.

III. The Data
Our sample consists of 214 firms, this being the subsample of the 436 firms

considered in Auerbach (1982b) for which observations for all variables used

are

for the entire twenty—year estimation period 1958—1911. The data

available

set contains information on daily stock prices and returns obtained from the
CRSP (Center for Research
and

in Securities Prices) data file. Annual balance sheet

income statement information comes from Standard and Poor's Conustat file.

The main adjustments made to the data before use involved the conversion of book
values of assets and liabilities into market va3iies, and the corresponding

correction of earnings. All such stocks and flows were deflated to obtain real
quantities.

In this section, we describe these adjustments, and also present sane sta-

tistics on

the pattern of new share

issues that will be useful in guiding the

modelling of firm behavior in subsequent sections of the paper.

A.

Data Adjustment

1.

Long—Term Debt

Because of fluctuations in long—term interest rates, the market value of

long—term

debt may differ from its book value. To correct for this, we must

know the maturity structure of debt and the interest rate at which each component was

issued.

—11—

Following the techniques of Braniard, Shoven and Weiss (1980) and Salinger
and Summers (1981), we assume

a.

all new issues of long—term debt have a maturity of 20 years;

b.

the coupon rate on each bond is the BAA

rate

prevailing in the

year of issue; and

In 1958,12 the maturity distribution of bonds in each firm was
proportional to the maturity distribution of aggregate
outstanding issues.13

New issues of debt after 1958 were calculated by subtracting the estimated book
value of retirements of 20 year old debt from the change in the book va]ne of

all debt. If such a number was negative, indicating additional retirenents, we
assumed that new issues were zero and that the oldest outstanding issues were
retired until the change in book value was accounted for.

Inventories

2.

Most firms use the LIFO (last—in, first—out) accounting method or the FIFO
(first—in,
states

small

first—out) method. Roughly speaking,

the first method correctly

inventory changes, while the second correctly states inventory stocks. A

number of firms use more than one method. For such firms, we assumed that

only what was listed as the predominant method was used.14

For FIFO inventories, we assume that stocks at the end of period t are
valued at current period prices. This amounts to assuming that inventories
turn over at least once a year, so that all inventories on the books at the end

—12—

of any year were purchased during that year. Thus, the corrected change in
inventories at current prices equals:

For LIFO finns,

if book

inventories increase, then all goods sold during

the year are treated as if purchased during the year, and no correction to ear—

nings is necessary. If inventories are depleted, then, to the extent of this
depletion,

goods purchased in earlier years are taken from the books, and an

adjustment is required. We assume that such "unlayering" goes back only to the

previous year, so that earnings must

Depreciation

Book depreciation of physical assets is inaccurate for two reasons. The
first is that depreciation fiires are based on historic asset costs, and thus
do not reflect changes in asset prices due to inflation. Second, the depreciation figure may

not reflect the actual pattern of econcanic depreciation. We

—13—

correct

only for the first of these problems.15 The method used calculates that

rate of declining balance (exponential) depreciation 6 that, when applied to a
perpetual inventory calculation for updating capital stocks beginning with the
1958 book value of net plant and equipment, yields the stated 1911 book value of

rate of depreciation of the firm's mix

assets. The use of beginning and end

of sample period net capital stocks, rather than simply adding up actual book
depreciation over the period, corrects for the fact that some assets are

scrapped, representing depreciation but not showing up in depreciation allowances 16

firms issuing new shares in years following one in which no new shares were

actually increased their dividends at least five percent.

How is it that firms vary their dividend very little, yet rarely find it
necessary to issue new shares. One explanation is debt: firms can adjust their

this procedure only can be sustained withit the frequent issuance

of new shares if the dividend is fundamentally in accordance with the firm's

earnings prospects. Otherwise, the debt—equity ratio will rise steadily or new

will be required. Indirect evidence that firms behave in this way is

provided by the following regression.
We constructed three variables for each firm:

the

This, in turn, seems to support the view that firms

These

results are consistent with a theory that is a hybrid of the "double—

tax" and "capitalization" views, incorporating both the short—run rigidity of

dividends and the aversion to issuing new shares. It is important that these
characteristics be incorporated into the model to be estimated below.

IV. Portfolio Equilibrium and Optimal Firm Behavior
The model presented below

is based on that used in Auerbach and King

(1982), and Auerbach (1982b). It extends the work of these papers by considering

the firm's investment decision as well as its financial policy, and by a

—17—

more explicit treatment of the nature of equity finance. These complications
are required if we are to model the behavior of firms

as

well as that of

investors. The reader not interested in the derivation may proceed directly- to

decisions? One obvious possibility is market value maximization: the maximization of the value of securities plus concurrent distributions. However, value
maximization has been criticized on three grounds:

(1) if there is incomplete spanning of markets, such a policy
would not be the generally agreed on aim of stockholders,
even in the absence of taxes;

(2) in the presence of taxes, even more stringent "tax" spanning
is required;26 and

(3) value maximization differs from the presumed objective of
wealth maximization.21

Because of the specification of multiplicative uncertainty in (.2), the first
of these criticisms does not apply here. This was first shown by Diamond

D. Summary

Our findings with respect to the cost of capital suggest that firms will
never choose to issue new shares, and will use debt or retained earnings

interest
their personal tax rate, th, and the "tax rate" on

according to whether the tax rate faced by their stockholders, on

income,

th, the minimum of

tax exent

debt inlicit in its discount, is less than or greater than the cor-

porate rate.28 These findings are preciseiy those one wtxild expect from the
certainty case (King 197)-t) but here they have been extended to the situation

where firms have different stockholder clienteles with different tax rates. It
is possible, therefore, for different firms to find different financing schens
most attractive.

R

—21—

To explain the coexistence of different forms of finance, except in dege-

nerate cases where the costs of two sources are equal, one must specify a
structure of constraints facing the firm. Such constraints might include the

inability

to issue negative dividends, repurchase shares, or borra more than a

specified

amount. As a result a finn might be forced to use a less

source

favored

of funds after having exhausted its first source. In this context, one

can think of firms as facing an upward sloping supply—of—funds schedule, with

three

components corresponding to the different sources of

finance. Of use in

our empirical analysis will be what the results of this section predict about
the effects of a firm's tax clientele on the height of the various segments of
the supply schedule. In particular, the cost of retentions, R
should

be nonincreasing with th, since

What remains is for us to develop an empirical methodolor for identifying
these supply schedules and tax clienteles, a task to which we now turn.

A Dynamic Model of Firm Behavior

We wish to formulate a model consistent

with the theory of Section IV and

the actual evidence on patterns of finance cited in Section III. At the same
time,

this

model must lend itself to empirical investigation.

Consider

a firm

the

utility of its shareholders by

accepting all projects that yield a return of p = R(1 —

where R is the

effective tax rate on debt faced by

these stockholders. Then (see Auerbach 19T9b)), the firm's objective is to

says

that the firm chooses the debt—assets ratio to minimize

and

the cost of equity, the latter of which depends on the value of

.

Here,

we may distirl€,uish three regimes, as in Auerbach (1979a).32

If the dividend constraint is not binding (n = 0, ii = th), then the finn
draws its equity funds from retentions. This is reflected by the fact that when
p
= 0, the cost of equity finance is
= R (÷ ), the cct of retentions

__

from

the previous section. Note that it is independent of th, the personal tax

rate on dividends. In this regina, the value of q , the ratio of equity value
to asset replacement cost less debt, equals (1_th).33 If the new share
constraint is not binding (n

= th,

=

0),

then firms are paying minimum

—31—

dividends, and issuing new shares. Here, as in Section IV, the cost of equity
finance is

While the cost of capital is still minimized by

(1—t)(i

the choice of b, the resulting optiimj. value of b, bN, is hher than the
value chosen in the first regime, br, since equity is more expensive and i(•)
is a convex function. Because new shares come from after—personal—tax dollars,

the value of the firm's q is one. This regime corresponds to the classical
view of the corporate tax, where the cost of capital is directly influenced by
the tax rate on dividends.

Finally,
reduce

dividend and repurchase shares. In this case, neither retentions nor

new issues serve as the marginal source of equity; there is a shadow cost of

equity capital that lies in between. Thus, marginal finance comes thrcugh debt.

As b rises from br to bN the cost of debt finance rises from the cost of
retentions to that of new shares, with q rising siixultaneously.35
Outside the steady state, analysis is more coirlicated by the effect of

present behavior on future constraints. For example, new issues today impose a

different cost according to whether the resulting extra earnin in future
periods

allow a reduction in new issues then, or simply

dends.

These results suggest that in periods when firms are observed to use more
expensive forms of finance, the projects they undertake have a higher marginal
product.

These higher returns should be observed in future years. Because we

do not observe marginal products, we must make some assumption about the shape

of the return function f(.) to proceed with our eiiirical analysis. For
simplicity,

(5.11)

we assume that f(.) is quadratic:

VI. Empirical Results

Equation (.i1) expresses a relationship for each firm between net—of—

depreciation, before tax returns in period t, F, and historical values of
investment and the cost of capital. However, there are a number of practical

—35—

difficulties that we must overcome before estimating the parameters of this
relationship.

First of all, the equation calls for an infinite history we do not have.
For all firms, our observations begin onJ in 1955. By truncating, we omit the
effects of pre—1955 values on each period's earnings. Since these effects die

out at rate 6 ,

one

method of acccunting for then would be to allow for firm

effects that decay over time at rate
regressions

than do this, we begin our
in 1963, allowing several years of data for initial lagged values.
Rather

A second difficulty concerns our assumption that depreciation allowances
follow economic depreciations In reality, th do not. Over most of the sanle

period, investment in equipnent qualified for an investnnt tax
cent

credit

of 7 per-

(raised to 10 percent in 1915), and depreciation allowances, while being

accelerated in 1954, 1962 and again in 1971, were based on historic cost.8
These characteristics caused the effective tax rate on corporate investment to

be below

the

statutory rate, in the aggregate, and to differ across invest-

ments.39

That is, the required before-tax rate of return needed to earn a given

after—tax

rate was lower than that described by (5.i1i),

in which the

statutory

rate appears. This does not affect the shape of before—tax returns over time,

their level. Therefore,

mereJy

(5.14) is

still appropriate,

but the cost f

capital tenn on the right—hand side must be adjusted downward. In princijiLe,

would be the same. Unfortunately, the method of lowering taxes in prac-

tice is by changing the timing of after—tax flows corresponding to given before-

tax flows. For exasle, accelerated depreciation allowances cause taxes to be
shifted to later years, making the flow of after—tax earnings from a given

investment decay at a rate faster than 6

at

which before—tax earnings decay.

Since this degree of shifting varies with the rate of effective taxation, a firm

by firm adjustment of 6 would still be required. Rather than attempt such
corrections, we present estimates using as the dependent variable both before—

tax and after—tax returns net of corrected depreciation, Et and At ,

firm's beta by the average ratio over the sample of equity to debt plus equity

results for after—tax earnings are quite similar, with essentially all

the coefficients in equation (6.24) being appropriately smaller than

Some care must be exercised in interpreting these findings. There still

remains a potential problem of simultaneity bias if the individual finn errors,
purged

of fixed effects, remain serially correlated. If

the unexplained random

component of earnings for a particular firm is positively autocorrelated, there

of bias in the estimated coefficients. First, as long

do not absorb the entire fluctuation in earnings, higher earnings

makes available a greater pool of retentions, making the issue of new shares

less likely, and possibly increasing the level of investment. This would tend
to bias downward the coefficient of the new share term, KN, and bias upward

the coefficient of K and K3. On the other hand, higher earnings today

the

may give

firm information on the profitability of its potential investment. If this

information leads to greater investment today, then the future

returns to

-3investment,

and hence the coefficient of the investment terms K and K, will

again be biased upward. The bias this effect induces in the new shares coef—

ficient depends on how the left out profitability variable depends on the likelihood

of new issues, given the level of investment. Under the hypothesis that

the

cost of capital does not increase when firms issue new shares, profitabiLity

can

be summarized by the

finan

firm's real decisions — its

level of investment. Its

cial policy is irrelevant. New issues may increase with profitability,

but variations in new issues independent of variations in investment can relate

only to such things as the level of retentions, already discussed. Thus, if new
shares are perceived by the firm

to be

no more expensive than retentions, only

the first, downward bias in the new shares coefficient will be present.

Therefore, our significantly positive coefficients in both before—tax and after—
tax regressions represent strong evidence against such a hypothesis.

If new shares are perceived by the firm as more expensive, then the likelihood of new issues can increase with profitability, for a given level of

investment. M example is shown in Figure 2, where lower retentions shift the
supply of funds schedule to the left, from
tability shifts

increase

to S1, and increased profi-

the marginal prokict curve up. Together, these shifts do not

investment, but do cause the firm to issue new shares. Thus, a poten-

tial upward bias is present in the new shares coefficient, but only if new
shares are perceived by the firm as more expensive, in accordance with our
hypothesis.

To avoid these possible biases, we reestimated the earnings ecjuations

earnings to flow from investment at a geometrically declining rate beginning in
the year after an investment, the exact pattern could vary substantially from

this. Such a specification error likely will be exacerbated by differencing.
For example, if earnings don't respond until two years after an investment, the
change in earnings in the year after an investment will be independent of the
amount of the investment.
In light of this problem, the results in Thble 6.4 offer impressive support
for

the existence of the tax effects just found. The coefficients of KN and Kth

remain quite significant in all specifications, while the coefficients on KNth
remain

insignificant. The fact that the coefficients of K are no longer signi-

ficant may signal the presence in the original earnings regressions of the sort
of upward biases discussed above.
In summary, our results support the hypothesis that new shares are perceived

by firms to be more expensive than retentions as a means of finance. Moreover,
the systematic variation of the cost of retentions with respect to indirect estimates
of the personal tax rates of finn stockholders suggests that this differential
is related to tax considerations (rather than transaction costs, for example).
These results are not consistent with the view that personal taxes don't matter,

which would predict no effect for Kth and (unless a nontax extra cost of new
shares issues were envisioned) KN, both of which have strongly significant coef-

ficients. Nor do they support the view that firms always behave as if they were
on the margin of issuing new shares, as the classifical or double—tax view would

suggest. This would predict a zero coefficient for KN, since whether firms

actually do issue new shares would be irrelevant. It would also

itive

predict a pos-

coefficient for Kth, since the cost of new shares is nondecreasing with

respect to th.

results do support a view that firms, facing various constraints, must in the
short run behave in a manner not optimal in the long run, issuing new shares

and, perhaps, too much debt instead of cutting dividends. To facilitate the
application of our findings to the analysis of the welfare effects of changes in
the tax policy toward corporate source income, a better understanding of these
constraints is necessary.

It is important here to stress, again, that these results relate to the

in

the United Kingdom and Germany, new shares are not necessarily a dominated form of finance. See the description in King (1977).

29. As a simplification, we assume that the future return from investment made
in period t is independent of investments made in periods s > t.
Clearly, this type of separability is unlikely to hold in general. One
would expect that unusually high profit opportunities would be eroded by

future increases in related investments. To son extent, this is accomo-

dated below by the assumption of geometric decay. The important feature we
wish to model is that unusually profitable investnEnts should produce
noticeably high returns in the years immediately following. One could also
derive this type of result from alternative models; for example, one with
homogeneous capital goods but convex capital stock adjustment costs.

quite useful.
