Sovereign Risk, Credibility and the Gold Standard: 1870-1913 versus 1925-31

ABSTRACT

What determines sovereign risk? We study the London bondmarket from the 1870s to the
1930s. Our findings support conventional wisdom concerning the low credibility of the interwar gold
standard. Before 1914 gold standard adherence effectively signalled credibility and shaved 40 to 60
basis points from country borrowing spreads. In the 1920s, however, simply resuming prewar gold
parities was insufficient to secure such benefits. Countries that devalued before resumption were
treated favorably, and markets scrutinized other signals. Public debt and British Empire membership
were important determinants of spreads after World War One, but not before.

1 Introduction
Can macroeconomic policymakers enhance credibility, and thus performance, by
the adoption of a hard currency peg? The experiment is often attempted. In recent
years many countries have tried to end histories of macroeconomic instability
through reform programs based on a fixed exchange rate. The variants of fixed
exchange rates have ranged from conventional currency pegs to currency boards to
currency unions to dollarisation, sometimes accompanied by elaborate institutional
engineering meant to enhance credibility with the markets.
Yet the success of these efforts has varied a great deal across countries. In
particular, the Argentine peso’s diastrous collapse after ten years of parity with the
United States dollar illustrates the difficulty nowadays of establishing credibility
even through some of the “harder” variants of currency peg. How should we
interpret such an outcome? We think that an exploration of a large set of historical
episodes could be informative. This paper aims to thow light on the relationship
between exchange rate regimes and credibility by closely examining two adjacent
but very different historical epochs of widespread exchange rate stabilisation, the
classical pre-World War One gold standard period and the years 1925–31 of the
interwar gold standard.
It is now widely believed that prior to 1914, gold standard orthodoxy conferred
credibility and was a sine qua non for access to global capital markets on favorable
terms. A path-breaking study by Bordo and Rockoff (1996) found that adherence to
gold standard rules acted as a “seal of approval” for sovereign debt. Gold standard
countries had lower country risk, measured by their bond spreads in London relative
to the British consol. By the time the interwar gold standard was reconstituted
starting in 1925, however, the underlying political equilibrium in most economies
had changed, with more political power in the hands of previously disadvantaged
working class parties and a greater awareness of government’s role in steering
economic outcomes (Polanyi, 1944; Temin, 1989; Eichengreen, 1996). Indeed,
divergent interest-group positions on macroeconomic policy were reflected in the
high inflation rates rampant in the early 1920s and in the national debates over the
appropriate exchange parity—devalued or not—at which to return to gold.
Hard evidence of a new political dynamic might be sought in a changing relationship between country risk and gold after 1925. With the rules of the game in
question after World War One, perhaps investors doubted that the mere adoption
of a gold standard regime would ensure the repayment of public debts. Consistent with such imperfect credibility, other indicators that could reassure foreign
investors about public solvency (such as the debt-GDP ratio) or protection of capi1

tal (such as membership in the British Empire) might have had a bigger impact on
international bond spreads under the reconstituted gold standard than before. Do
the data indeed support these conjectures?
There is no uniform and comprehensive study of bond spreads across the pre1914 and interwar gold standards that would allow us definitively to answer such
questions. A study of interwar spreads by Bordo, Edelstein, and Rockoff (1999),
however, came to a conclusion that was surprising, even by the authors’ own
admission.1 Looking solely at 1920s bond yields, they found continued evidence
that the gold standard remained a seal of approval when a country returned to its
prewar exchange parity with gold, lowering bond spreads significantly in that case.
Devaluers were not so lucky with their bond spreads: for them, the effect of being
on gold was found to be small and statistically insignificant. Such findings seem
to challenge the conventional wisdom that the interwar gold standard was a pale
and less credible shadow of its predecessor.
These are two pioneering studies, but they are not ideal for comparative work
across regimes because of differences in the type of data that each employs. The
former study looked at long-term government bonds in the secondary market, and
examined their yield to maturity; the latter examined new issues and their yield at
the moment of flotation only. The former study therefore had complete time series,
whereas the latter had a small sample that was often interrupted by missing data in
years when no issues took place—a not uncommon event in the 1920s, and one that
raises a potential sample-selection issue (presumably, bonds tend not to be floated
when conditions are unfavorable). Finally, the former study examined prices in
London, the latter prices in New York, a defensible switch as the hegemonic centre
of global capital markets shifted across the Atlantic around this time, and one that
allowed the use of Cleona Lewis’s (1938) figures on new issues during the 1920s.
To overcome the differences between these two earlier investigations, we compare the determinants of bond spreads in the pre-1914 and interwar years using
a consistent set of data for a larger sample of countries from 1870 through 1939.
We focus on a sample of more than 20 diverse countries—some within the British
Empire, some outside, some in the core and some in the periphery—to see how
their country risk evolved. This allows us to focus on the same type of risk measure
across both prewar and interwar eras. To isolate the effects of default (as opposed
to exchange rate) risk, spreads over London are exclusively for bonds denominated
1 See

also Ferguson (2001, p. 333), who suggests that the surprising conclusion of the interwar
study throws doubt on the findings in the original Bordo-Rockoff study of pre-1914 yields. However,
the two studies use very different sources for their yield data, as we explain in a moment.

in gold or in sterling. Most of our yield-to-maturity data come from the Global
Financial Data (GFD) source and pertain to bonds traded in London. When GFD
did not report appropriate data for gold or sterling-indexed bonds, however, we collected it ourselves from contemporary journalistic sources, in a few cases resorting
to yield quotations from the New York market.
Figure 1 offers an overview of our yield data over the full period 1870–1939.
The mean bond spreads over London for two subsamples (the Core and Empire
subset and the Periphery Nonempire subsets) are presented in the top and bottom
charts respectively, and each is surrounded by a measure of dispersion, a band
equal to plus or minus two standard deviations.2 The units are percentage points
and the scales are deliberately the same on the two charts.
The differences between the two subsamples are very striking: the core had
much smaller country risk than the periphery, as expected. Core and empire countries usually had interest rates within one or two percentage points of Britain’s, at
least from 1880 to 1930. The periphery could have spreads as large as five, ten,
or even twenty percentage points, the latter spread usually tantamount to being in
default.
The figures also show some similarities, once we normalise for this scale difference. Both core and periphery experienced a convergence in bond spreads up to
1914. For both country groupings we observe good deal of volatility in the interwar
years, when spreads widened, but there appears to have been some convergence
during Britain’s brief interwar return to gold, 1925–31. We seek to understand the
gold standard’s role in these two convergence episodes.
Our empirical analysis allows public indebtedness to play a role in determining borrowing spreads. Macroeconomic variables correlated with gold-standard
adherence, such as public debt, might be responsible for the apparent pre-1914
benefits of going on gold, or might mask such benefits after the World War One.
Before the war, countries on gold may have had more disciplined fiscal policies,
lower public debt, and hence more favorable treatment by the bond markets. On
the other hand, countries that inflated away their public debts in the early or mid1920s would have been unlikely to rejoin gold at prewar parity, making high public
debts and a return to gold at par positively correlated variables. In these circumstances, one major concern is that failing to control for public debt could lead us to
2 The core countries are Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, New Zealand,
Norway, Sweden, and the United States. The empire countries are Australia, Canada, India, New
Zealand, and South Africa. The periphery nonempire countries are Argentina, Austria (or AustriaHungary), Brazil, Chile, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, Turkey
(or the Ottoman Empire), and Uruguay.

overestimate the prewar benefit of gold standard adherence and underestimate the
postwar benefit of returning to gold at the prewar exchange rate. A contribution of
the paper is its collection and use of historical series on the public debts of a large
number of borrowing countries.3,4
This paper’s findings reinstate conventional wisdom concerning the low credibility of the interwar gold standard. We confirm the Bordo-Rockoff (1996) findings
on the pre-war gold standard, notwithstanding a larger country sample and the inclusion of a wider set of macro-fundamental determinants of spread. Before the
First World War, gold standard adherence was an effective credibility signal that
shaved about 40 to 60 basis points from a country’s external public borrowing cost.
The interwar results below, however, suggest that in the 1920s, returning to gold at
prewar parity no longer was enough to soothe international investors. After World
War One, there was no significant “good housekeeping” effect of returning to gold
at prewar parity. At best, it was the countries returning to gold at depreciated
levels that gained; and they gained somewhat less than had prewar gold adherents.
Moreover, public debt and Empire membership were important determinants of
borrowing spreads after World War One, though not before.
3 Bordo

and Rockoff (1996) examined the effect on borrowing spreads of the public deficit
relative to GDP, a flow variable, but found it to be statistically insignificant. Our experiments with
the deficit variable led to the same negative conclusion. If we wish to assess solvency, however, the
stock variable, public debt, seems preferable. Based on a specification that includes public debt,
Flandreau et al. (1998) find prewar spread effects of gold-standard adherence similar in size to
those reported by Bordo and Rockoff (about 35–55 basis points). We discuss the relation between
our results and those of Flandreau et al. below.
4 The discussion of omitted fiscal variables points to a deeper identification problem in any
attempt to pinpoint a “pure” yield effect of gold standard adherence. Countries’ decisions over the
monetary regime are in most cases endogenously determined, and without controlling for a broad
range of economic and political variables, one cannot know whether bond spreads are being driven
by gold adherence per se or by the domestic economic circumstances that facilitate adherence
or force suspension. We therefore urge extreme caution in the interpretation of our estimated
spread “effects” of the gold standard. We can legitimately infer from them, not a gold impact
that is independent of other economic factors, but merely a partially unconditional average benefit
accruing to countries in a position to adopt the gold standard. During both of the eras we study
countries able to adopt gold by and large did so, and we believe that our results do provide a
valid approach to understanding how the credibility of gold commitments changed after the First
World War. In our empirical examination of the interwar period below, we attempt to control in a
crude way for the global disruptions forcing gold standard departures starting in 1929. We hope to
address explicitly the regime selection problem in future work, although analysis is complicated by
the very diverse scenarios through which various countries have adopted or left the gold standard
at different times. Meissner (2002) models empirically the spread of the prewar gold standard.

2 Five suggestive cases
Case studies are suggestive but not definitive; we present five for purposes of
illustration. Ultimately, careful examination of a broader range of cases would be
a useful complement to the more aggregative econometric analysis that we carry
out in the next section.
In the United States the Resumption Act came into force in January 1875. The
Act legislated a return to a unified gold-backed currency on January 1, 1879. To
assess the effect of gold standard adherence on United States government bond
spreads, we must account for the fact that the return to gold was anticipated well
in advance. One way to do so is to track simultaneously the exchange rate. In
Figure 2 we show the paths over time of the price of gold in terms of the floating
paper greenbacks issued to finance the Civil War, as well as of the relative yield
on gold bonds—specifically, Macaulay’s (1938, p. A218) gold railroad bonds—
relative to the London consol yield. The announcement that greenbacks would be
redeemed at par nearly four years later obviously was not credible early in 1875.
Rather than falling, the greenback price of gold initially rose. Only later in that
year did the greenback begin its appreciation toward par.5 The concomitant decline
in the bond spread is impressive—around 200 basis points.
Argentina returned to the gold standard on October 31, 1899, nearly a decade
after abandoning gold in the Baring Crisis. Starting in 1891, the country embarked
upon a deflationary policy so as to be able to resume gold convertibility at an
unchanged parity, even though the currency utimately was pegged at a devalued
rate (see della Paolera and Taylor, 2001). Figure 3 shows how both the exchange
rate and the borrowing spread over London behaved: both moved strongly together
over the 1890s, suggesting that expectations of resumption and borrowing costs
were indeed strongly interrelated. When Julio Roca, a strong advocate of the
gold standard, was re-elected to the presidency in the fall of 1898, the currency
appreciated sharply and the spread over British borrowing costs fell, eventually
dropping further as the restored gold standard endured. Roca announced the return
to gold before congress on May 25, 1899 and resumption occurred six months later.
By the end of 1902 Argentina’s external borrowing spread was nearly 200 basis
points lower than when Roca came to power.
Argentina’s brief return to gold at the prewar parity, lasting from August 1927
and December 1929, had no such dramatic effect on its foreign borrowing costs.

The spread over U.K consols changed hardly at all over the period 1926–28. The
striking contrast with the previous resumption epsiode is consistent with the view
that Argentina’s brief interwar gold standard had a much smaller beneficial effect
on the public finances than its prewar counterpart.
Australia’s experience in the 1920s resembles that of Argentina, as shown in
Figure 4. Australia returned to gold at the same time as Britain (April 1925); like
Britain, it returned at the prewar parity. The decline in the government’s borrowing
cost (relative to London), however, was delayed and rather small. Australia effectively left gold at the start of 1930, well before Britain’s departure on September
19, 1931 ended the interwar gold standard. Australia’s abandonment of gold was
forced by severe economic problems originating in sharp falls in the prices of its
commodity exports (Eichengreen, 1992, pp. 232–36). The borrowing spread over
London rose sharply after Australia went off gold, but it had already begun to rise
in December 1929, the month before the country effectively left the gold standard.
The spread increase clearly was driven by fears of default that quickly forced the
country to curtail gold convertibility, not by a progressive abandonment of gold
per se. Thus, for Australia also, the interwar gold standard was less successful
than its prewar predecessor in instilling confidence in foreign investors.
France’s interwar return to gold offers a contrast to the two preceding cases;
however, France returned to gold at a sharply devalued parity. The return occurred

in stages, and Figure 5 shows how the exchange rate (franc price of dollars) and
the external borrowing spread over London covaried. Raymond Poincaré formed
a government in July 1926 as the franc reached a low point, driven by a crisis of
public deficits and inflation. As a result of the fiscal consolidation measures that
the Poincaré government immediately introduced, the franc appreciated sharply
and finally was pegged in December 1926. In the period leading to this de facto
embrace of gold—by then, sterling along with the dollar was linked to the metal—
the external borrowing spread over London dropped sharply. This response lends
support to Sargent’s (1993) thesis that Poincaré’s consistent fiscal and monetary
reform package enjoyed great credibility in the eyes of the financial markets. That
is not the end of the story, though. As Figure 5 shows, France’s de jure adoption
of the gold standard on June 25, 1928 was followed by a further large decline in
the borrowing spread. France remained on gold long after Britain departured, and
one sees that in 1932 its borrowing spread over London paper rocketed upward
as the worldwide depression progressed. But for this important case of a country
returning to gold at a devalued parity, adherence coincided with a large decline in
the cost of foreign borrowing through September 1931.
Obviously such evidence can be suggestive only, as it fails to control for several
potential determinants of spreads, so we now turn to a more formal statistical
analysis of a broader sample of countries.
9

3 Econometric analysis
We now proceed with a formal comparative analysis of sovereign borrowing risk
in the prewar and interwar periods. Following Bordo and Rockoff (1996), we
investigate the relationship between the dependent variable country risk, measured by the bond spread over London (measured in percentage points per annum),
SPREADit = YIELDit − YIELDUK,t , and selected macroeconomic policy variables that could play a role for country i and time t. One such variable is gold
standard adherence, measured by dummy variables: GSit , which takes the value
1 if on date t country i is on gold at any parity, GSPARit , which takes the value
1 if on date t country i is on gold after 1914 at its prewar parity, and GSDEVit ,
which takes the value 1 if the country is on gold at a devalued parity after 1914. In
our interwar analysis we also introduce a heretofore unexamined dummy variable,
GSOFFit , which takes a value of 1 for countries that had adopted gold at some point
but departed prior to Britain’s September 1931 departure. Absent this dummy, the
cost associated with leaving gold in crisis conditions would inflate our estimate of
the benefit of adopting gold. But as in the Australian case discussed above, the
rises in spreads that accompanied exchange rate collapses starting in 1929 were
the result of global forces such as declining commodity prices and reduced capital
flows, and thus were much more than a penalty for gold abandonment per se.
We also include the lagged inflation rate, INFLi,t−1 . As a final macro explanatory variable, we examine the effects of lagged public debt levels, measured by
the ratio of nominal debt to nominal output, DEBTi,t−1 . Country fixed effects are
used to capture constant but unmeasured political, economic, institutional, or geographic features of individual countries (for example, location on the “periphery”).
Like Bordo and Rockoff, we also find it necessary to account for global interest
rate shocks that affect spreads in all markets in a given year. To do this, following the
logic of the “international CAPM” model, we include (with a country specific slope,
or “β”) a measure of “market risk” in the form SPREADW ,t = YIELDWORLD,t −
YIELDUK,t , where this term is the GDP-weighted average world spread over the
“safe rate” (London) for the countries in the sample at time t.6
Using pooled annual data for a large sample of countries, the basic fixed-effects
regression equation is then of the form
SPREADit = αi + βi SPREADW ,t + γ Xit + uit ,

(1)

6 We experimented with other ways to control for time specific asset market shifts, such as
simple time dummies, but the results appear robust.

10

where typically the vector X includes gold standard adherence, the lagged debt
ratio, lagged inflation, and possibly other control variables.
Such a specification can be rationalised in a model where the government’s
bond rate reflects the central rate plus a default premium, and in which new government borrowing depends on the current interest rate. In that case, the regression
coefficients are reduced-form coefficients incorporating the government’s incentive to borrow less when the rate charged is high, but they nonethless indicate
whether the gold standard and macro fundamentals affected perceived risk. When
we discuss “effects” of explanatory variables on the spread below, we refer to the
reduced-form regression coefficients.7
For the dependent variable SPREAD, due care must be taken in constructing
measures of country risk to ensure that the bonds in every case are properly comparable across countries. We want SPREAD to capture the effects of default risk
only, and not the effects of the potential exchange rate changes that are inherent in
bonds’ differing currency denominations. In this case, since we are using Britain
as the base country, we elect to focus only on government bonds of long maturity
(greater than five years, and usually at least ten) and payable in gold or sterling.
It is therefore necessary to eliminate the polluting effects of Britain’s departures
from the gold standard—from August 1914 to April 1925 and from September
1931. Hence, we focus on only two periods: a prewar period based on annual
December yields from 1870 to 1913, and an interwar period based on June yields
from 1925 to 1931. This affords us up to 44 observations in the time dimension
for the prewar sample, and up to seven for the interwar sample.
To construct SPREAD we then need bond yields for each country, also payable
in gold or sterling, from which we can subtract the consol yield. Finding them is
not always an easy task. Because, ideally, our test requires a gold or sterling bond
as quoted in London, data construction requires considerable caution. It is a well7 Suppose

that
SPREADt = a + bDEBTt + cZt + vt ,

where the variables Zt are various solvency indicators. Furthermore, suppose that new government
borrowing depends negatively on the spread,

known problem that in standard secondary sources, the attributes of a particular
bond issue are not always readily apparent.
Bordo and Rockoff (1996) split their samples into gold bonds and paper bonds,
finding little effect of gold standard adherence on the yields of bonds payable in
domestic paper. Care is needed because many paper bonds in fact contained gold
clauses or exchange clauses, which (if enforceable) would have allowed creditors
to extract payment in specie or hard currency if the debtor devalued. This condition
was frequently stipulated for borrowers with poor reputations for fiscal and monetary stability. Then as now, such borrowers suffered from “original sin”—that is,
an inability to issue debt denominated in one’s own currency. Only a handful of
countries have been capable of own-currency borrowing in the last two centuries
(Rousseau and Sylla, 2003). The history of nineteenth and early twentieth century bond issuance is only now being fully explored to give us some insight into
the constraints that faced borrowers with respect to details of contracts, including
denominations of debt issue (Bordo, Meissner, and Redish, 2002; Flandreau and
Sussman, 2002).8
A great many data on bond yields are contained in the reference Global Financial Data (GFD), of which we make extensive use. For our purposes, however, we
sometimes found it necessary to corroborate the type of bond quoted in GFD using
bond manuals such as Kimber’s Record and other sources. In many cases, the
bond yields quoted in GFD failed to satisfy our requirements, being only domestic
rather than London quotations, or possibly yields denominated in domestic currency, and this eliminated several countries from our database (such as Denmark
in the prewar years and Spain in the interwar years). We treated the United States
during the 1870s just as Bordo and Rockoff (1996) did, using Charles Calomiris’s
series on gold equivalent yields, for a period in which the terms of payment were in
doubt (Bordo, Meissner, and Redish, 2002). Countries like Belgium, France and
8 If

a government’s gold standard commitment had been permanent, noncontingent, and completely credible, then its paper bonds would have been “as good as gold” and any fall in external
borrowing costs would have been inherited by the paper bonds. It therefore may seem puzzling that
Bordo and Rockoff could not detect gold standard effects on paper yields. If countries’ exchange
rate commitments lacked credibility, why not their commitments to repay gold-denominated debt
at par? Prewar gold standard conventions, however, allowed for suspension in the event of certain
contingencies (notably, wars) provided resumption took place at the previous gold parity (Bordo
and Kydland, 1995). Thus, paper bonds might entail some shorter-term exchange risk even for
countries following conventional gold standard rules, whereas gold- or sterling-denominated bonds
were supposedly payable in the currency of denomination regardless of the issuing government’s
circumstances. The different behavior of indexed and paper yields certainly warrants further investigation. Cook (2002) discusses the case of Russian bonds.

12

Germany—which issued debt in domestic currency—had to be omitted in the prewar sample, but we were able to find interwar data on appropriately denominated
Belgian and French bonds traded in New York and on the German Dawes Loan
as quoted in London. Missing data were often a problem too. Some of the gaps
in GFD, especially in the interwar years, could be filled by consulting newspapers
such as the Investor’s Monthly Manual (for a London quote) or, as a last resort,
the Wall Street Journal (for New York quotes on gold-linked bonds). Full details
of the construction of the yield data are in the appendix.
Other complications affect our use of historical bond yield data. The compiler
of the GFD source, Bryan Taylor, warns in the documentation (September 2000)
that: “For riskier issues, such as Latin American countries, not only was there a risk
that coupons could be eliminated, but that the entire issue could go in default. At
that point, the implied yield becomes meaningless, and any yield over 10% before
World War Two should be treated as implying that the issue was in default on
either coupon, on principal, or on both.” Because our model is intended to capture
country risk under conditions with a positive probability of full repayment, once
an issue actually is in default we might expect its yield to be volatile indeed, and
perhaps far removed from any simple linear prediction given by a model of the
form (1). Such defaults were not uncommon in our data, and in some cases spreads
grew to 20, 30 or even 60 percentage points on some issues, implying prices of
less than 10% of par value.
Although such steep discounts on bonds affect only a small part of our sample,
we discuss below the steps we can take to ensure that these types of observation
do not bias the regression estimates. As might be expected, many of these observations correspond to periods of severe political unrest or uncertainty associated
with revolutions (e.g., Mexico in the 1920s), civil wars and their aftermath (e.g.,
Uruguay in the 1870s), or similar disturbances. This is not to deny that military
strife is often a key determinant of bond yields (Ferguson, 2001), but we are not so
naive as to claim that a model like (1) might function well with merely the addition of dummies or qualitative variables for “War,” “Assassinations,” and the like.
Instead, we concentrate on a narrower and cleaner specification where a positive
probability of full repayment also presupposes sufficient political stability to make
linear approximations meaningful.9
9 Still, it is certainly a worthy topic for future research to expand this kind of model to include
measures of conflict, whether internal or external, political or military. To quantify the nature of any
given war would appear intractable, however. A more profitable direction might be to experiment
with other determinants of country risk including now-standard “institutional” measures such as
democracy, rule of law, property rights, and so on.

13

For independent variables we centre our analysis on the key policy regime
variable that was, during this era, at the heart of monetary policy: the adoption or
suspension of the gold standard. We construct a dummy variable GS that reflects
each country’s position in a given year on this policy dimension (on gold equals one,
and off equals zero). The appendix gives details of our coding procedure, which
of necessity involves somewhat subjective judgements even for such an apparently
clear-cut variable as gold-standard adherence. Several countries (notably Spain
and Italy before 1914) spent many years posturing as “shadow” members of the
gold standard—fixing and defending their exchange rate, yet not fully embracing
gold convertibility or other “rules of the game.” In the classifications of many
scholars this leads to a delicate decision as to whether such cases should be treated
as on or off gold (see, e.g., Martín Aceña, 2000; Fratianni and Spinelli, 1984).
The situation during the interwar period is murkier still. After World War One,
many countries first stabilised their currencies de facto with respect to gold, moving
only gradually toward the de jure embrace of gold standard rules. Similarly, exits
from the gold standard starting in 1929 sometimes were accomplished in piecemeal
fashion, a first step often being some sort of formal or informal government control
over gold outflows. Indeed, the tendency of governments to tinker with the interwar
gold standard is a key reason scholars have viewed it as imperfectly credible. Our
classification corresponds largely to de jure gold standard adherence, as we describe
in the appendix.10
The other economic control variables in our model allow fiscal, monetary, and
macroeconomic conditions to affect country risk. DEBT is a measure of the public debt to GDP ratio of the country (lagged one year), typically based on central
government debt. This variable is included to allow for the possibility that markets might impose more severe credit conditions on highly indebted governments,
where, ceteris paribus, default risk is higher. INFL is a measure of the rate of price
inflation (lagged one year). Because many countries operated on fractional gold
10 Our

interwar dates, although generally in agreeement with those of Officer (2001), contradict
in a number of cases the annual codings reproduced in Eichengreen (1992, pp. 188–90).
A general problem with the type of coding we use is that reinstatement of gold was in some
cases anticipated (recall Section 2), with some fraction of the beneficial spread effects possibly
front-loaded. In that case our estimates of the benefit of gold adherence could be biased downward.
One way to deal with the problem within this paper’s framework might be through anticipatory
dummies. In our view, however, the diverse circumstances of countries’ paths back to gold warrant
a case-by-case analysis with more detailed macroeconomic and political control variables than are
available for broad cross-sectional work. This we leave for future research. In cases such as that of
interwar France (Section 2), for example, one would ideally disentangle the benefits of gold from
those of the Poincaré stabilisation measures that made de jure resumption possible two years later.

14

backing, this variable could be important as a way for markets to detect slippage in
gold standard commitments by governments, for example, at the start of episodes of
overvaluation that might lead to reserve loss followed by eventual suspension and
debt crisis.11 These two variables have straightforward interpretations as policy
descriptors.
We also add two more economic variables often seen in country risk studies.
The first is EXPORTS, a measure of the export to GDP ratio, which reveals the
capacity of the country to earn the foreign exchange needed to service externallyheld debt. This indicator is commonly used as a risk measure today by emerging
market credit analysts. A final variable, LOGY, a measure of real income per
capita (relative to the sample mean), serves as a catch-all variable that proxies for
all manner of social, political, institutional and financial developments along the
road to modernisation that might make a country a better credit risk.12
The gradual convergence of bond spreads evident in Figure 1 warns us that the
dynamics of evolving country risk might not be simple. In particular, the figure
suggests high levels of persistence or serial correlation in bond spreads, and it is
easy to imagine why. Bond spreads are a function of reputation, which in capital
markets, as in any other repeated game, cannot be built overnight. Instead, one’s
reputation in the previous period is likely to have a substantial influence on one’s
reputation today. In our empirical results we present two alternative estimates
based on different approaches to modelling of the persistence in spreads. One way
is to impound all of the persistence in the error term, using an AR1 model. Another
way is to use a lagged dependent variable model, so that spreads themselves follow
a partial adjustment process towards long-run equilibrium.

3.1 Prewar findings, 1870–1913
As a cross check we begin our analysis with a simple attempt to replicate the
findings of Bordo and Rockoff (1996), who used a sample of just seven countries
in the prewar era, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Italy and the United
States. Based on pooled data for gold bonds (267 observations), their headline
number for the impact of the gold standard on country risk was presented as follows:
11 Bordo and Rockoff (1996) use the gap between money growth and real output as their measure

of monetary laxity, but, even if we do not assume a stable velocity, the outcome variable INFL can
serve as an adequate measure of excess money supply growth.
12 Real income per capita (at PPP prices) and the export ratio were included in the pre-1914
country risk analysis of Flandreau et al. (1998).

15

Indeed, if we were to single out one number to represent our findings
with respect to the significance of the gold-adherence dummy it would
be 40 basis points.… In other words, all other things equal, the rate on
a gold bond would be 40 basis points lower if the country were on the
gold standard. Other factors, perhaps related to regional preferences,
undoubtedly also played a role in determining country-risk premia.
But our analysis suggests a willingness to commit to the gold standard
was an important determinant of risk premia established in the London
capital market. (Bordo and Rockoff, 1996, p. 413.)
We are in broad agreement with this conclusion. Regression 1 of Table 1
shows that our data, some of it from different sources, enables us to duplicate
the Bordo-Rockoff finding on their country sample. We have slightly longer time
series that yield 301 observations for the Bordo-Rockoff countries, but we find,
as they did, that adopting the gold standard was worth a reduction in spread of
about 40 basis points. The effect is highly statistically significant. As Bordo
and Rockoff noted, strong serial correlation in this context renders ordinary least
squares (OLS) invalid, so like them we employ an AR1 specification, allowing for
possibly different autoregressive parameters in each member of the panel.13 That is
we estimate an equation of the form (1) under the assumption that uit = ρi ui,t−1 + it
and it are white noise disturbances.
Here, and throughout this section, the βi coefficients are not shown to conserve
space but they also accord with expectations and past results, being higher in
“riskier” peripheral countries. Country fixed effects, which are reported, are high
for peripheral countries such as Brazil (237 basis points), Italy (172), Argentina
(180), and Chile (160), but lower for the core western offshoots, Australia, Canada,
and the United States (101, 41, and 34 basis points, respectively).
Regression 2 now expands this analysis substantially by using our augmented
data set covering more than 20 countries from 1870 to 1913. The sample size here
increases by a factor of nearly three, to 871 observations. The model performs
poorly in that the estimated effect of the gold standard (again roughly 40 basis
points) is not statistically significant at conventional levels. Still, we find that
this result is an artefact of a few badly-behaved outliers in the data. Specifically,
13 Unlike Bordo and Rockoff (1996), we do not employ SUR models, but we have explored SUR

results for limited samples and find the results broadly similar. However, the larger cross-section
size in our later regressions calls for a large parameter set in the unrestricted error covariance matrix
under SUR, sometimes too large a set for the available degrees of freedom. In all of our tables, the
country coefficients identified vertically along the left are the country-specific intercepts.

when we exclude observations with very high spreads (over 2,000 or 1,500 or
1,000 basis points) as in Regressions 3, 4 and 5, we find that the effect of the
gold standard is strong and statistically significant, though the effect is a little
smaller in Regression 5, where truncation is more severe, and bigger in the other
regressions. These findings requires the exclusion of very few data points, since
even Regression 5, the most restrictive, still has 831 observations, a loss of less
than 5% of the sample. Of course, these are the data points that correspond to
issues in default trouble, often the result of military or political crises, as noted
above. Accordingly, we proceed on the assumption that our country risk model is
adequate for less dire circumstances.14
Our broader aim is to consider the role of additional country characteristics in
determining country risk. Since certain geopolitical features of countries remained
fairly constant in this period, a natural place to start is by examining the country
fixed effects for clues. And since Britain is being used as the reference country in
the analysis, an important feature to examine would be any special country-specific
links to Britain. An obvious criterion is membership in the British Empire.
Ever since Marx and Hobson, students who view history through the lens of
political economy—whether from left, right or centre—have regarded imperialism
as a leading vehicle on the road to economic globalisation. Its epitome, the British
Empire, is seen as, amongst other things, a privileged economic zone in both trade
and capital markets. Empire connections among countries are believed to have
conveyed some distinct advantages to would-be borrowers in London. Davis and
Huttenback (1986) and Edelstein (1981) have suggested that Empire membership
meant a lower cost of capital to both public and private sectors in this era.
Taking the argument further, Ferguson (2002) places these ideas in the context
of a broader political and financial history and claims support, on economic if not
on other grounds, for his case that the British Empire was a global public good:
My hypothesis is that empire—and particularly the British Empire—
encouraged investors to put their money in developing economies. The
reasoning is straightforward. Investing in such economies is risky.
They tend to be far away and more prone to economic, social and
political crises. But the extension of empire into the less developed
14 Due

to the more restricted samples for which data on the additional control variables are
available, we virtually never again encounter observations with spreads larger than 1,000 basis
points. The only exceptional case is that of interwar Mexico, which, being still in the throes of
post-revolutionary instability, exhibited high and volatile spreads and therefore is excluded from
our analysis.

18

world had the effect of reducing such risks by imposing, directly or
indirectly, some form of European rule. In practice, money invested
in a de iure British colony such as India (or a colony in all but name
like Egypt) was a great deal more secure than money invested in a de
facto “colony” such as Argentina.
This effect should be—and is—quantifiable. There are two ways of
posing the crucial question. First, did the existence of the British
Empire make investors more willing to put their money into poorer
countries than they would otherwise have been? More precisely, did
being a British colony reduce the cost of borrowing for a country?
The hypothesis here is that it did, because being a colony implied a
no-default guarantee. This was arguably a better “seal of good housekeeping” even than membership of the gold standard, though most
British colonies had both. (Ferguson, 2002, p. 12.)
Here, one contrast to the Bordo and Rockoff (1996) claim is quite explicit.
Empire, not the gold standard, was what really counted for attracting capital in large
quantities at low cost, though the two forces need not have been mutually exclusive
and, indeed, were positively correlated. To settle the debate econometrically,
however, requires careful controls for these and other risk determinants.
It is imperative, then, that we consider the “Empire effect” in our analysis. The
question is whether countries within the Empire enjoyed preferential access to the
market, and we interpret that to imply that, all else equal, Empire countries should
exhibit a smaller fixed effect than others. This can be studied by looking at each
individual intercept in the regression. Or, for a summary comparison of the two
groups, we can ask whether the mean fixed effect in the empire group was less than
the mean in the nonempire group. The mean fixed effect for each group is shown
in the bottom panel of Table 1, together with the t-statistic for the estimated mean
(where the null is a zero mean).
Our results are not too favorable to the idea of an “Empire effect” during the
so-called Age of High Imperialism. In Regression 2 even the sign is wrong. In
the possibly more robust regressions (3, 4, and 5) the sign is correct, and Empire
membership seems to be worth about 20 to 30 basis points as a point estimate; but
this was no more valuable than going on gold—and, unlike the effect of gold, this
impact is not statistically significant.15
“strong” test of the Empire hypothesis would be to also require the β coefficients to be
zero for Empire members. That would imply that their returns did not co-vary with changes in the
15 A

19

A detailed look at some of the fixed effects reveals some of the problem cases.
Consider Regression 5. In the nonempire group only some countries (once we
include the effect of being on gold) paid a large risk penalty, namely Argentina
(about 137 basis points), Brazil (195), Chile (125), Greece (186), Italy (136), Japan
(204), and Portugal (138). Others appear to have paid no premium at all. Yet even
the richest country in the world (by some measures) and Empire member Australia
had to pay a statistically significant risk premium of about 58 basis points, though
no other Empire countries were so burdened.16
The reasons for Australia’s plight are easy to guess, given the severe and enduring consequences of the widespread defaults associated with the 1890 crash and
subsequent depression, which crippled Australia’s banks and dented the country’s
reputation in the London market (see Davis and Gallman, 2001). The Australian
results show that, even if empire borrowers were proof against outright sovereign
default, they were not proof against a severe economic crisis. Some narrative evidence seems to back this up, as British and empire issues were not always viewed
as pure substitutes by outside observers with a keen eye on the determinants of risk
premia.17
Conversely, even some peripheral nonempire countries such as Uruguay (which
was well within “contagion range” of Argentina and Brazil) seemed not to have
been penalised in capital markets despite being outside the formal empire. Empire
status was neither necessary nor sufficient for preferential access to the London
market. Much seemed to depend on other aspects of the behavior of the borrower—
for our purposes, an unobservable.
In Table 2 we use the full data set to check the robustness of the preceding
results to additional controls for debt ratios, inflation, and relative income per
capita. Regression 1 in Table 2 adds DEBT and INFL to the spread equation.
As we noted in the introduction, the omission of DEBT in particular could very
plausibly lead to biases.18 We are now restricted to a much smaller sample than in
global spread—in other words, that they were “safe” assets like the British consol itself, up to a
white noise error. But this hypothesis is very decisively rejected. Although the β coefficients are
not reported in the tables to conserve space, these results are available from the authors on request.
16 These estimates are 35 basis points less than the reported intercepts because we also include
the effect of going on gold.
17 For example, during the Japanese government’s internal debate over investing foreign reserves
during the mid-1890s, the finance minister asked “Are the public bonds of the Indian Government
as safe and reliable as those of England itself?” (Matsukata, 1899, p. 221).
18 Flandreau et al. (1998) argue that a major factor driving the evident convergence of bond spreads
after the early 1890s and through 1914 is worldwide inflation resulting from gold discoveries, a
factor that caused both an unexpected reduction in countries’ ratios of public debt to nominal

Table 1, since our new variables DEBT and INFL are not available for all countries
in all years. From a maximum of 871 observations, we are now down to 546. For
this pre-1914 sample, the gold standard seal of approval is still strong in all of the
regressions (and estimated to be at or near 50 basis points).
Perhaps surprisingly, neither DEBT nor INFL is significant in Regression 1,
although both are correctly signed. The gold standard commitment appeared strong
enough that markets could rely on contained inflation and debt repayment. In an
interesting twist, we also find that the Empire thesis is again rejected, but for a
more powerful reason. In this smaller subsample, all countries could expect, once
on gold, to converge to the British bond yield.
Regression 2 performs a different kind of robustness check. What if the markets priced risk differently among mature versus emerging debtors, or core versus
periphery? To test this we partitioned the sample into core and periphery, and
then interacted the macroeconomic variables DEBT and INFL with the periphery
dummy (defined in the appendix). The results show that, at conventional significance levels, the hypothesis that periphery risk was priced differently can be
rejected, although there is a hint that high periphery debt levels were punished
rather more severely on the margin. Here once again, as in all specifications in
Table 2, the “Empire effect” is found to be statistically indistinguishable from zero
based on the difference between the mean fixed effects.
Regression 3 attempts to resuscitate the “Empire effect” another way. Perhaps
the advantages of Empire were not a lower unconditional level of country risk,
but a more tolerant view of debt and inflation variables by the markets? As in
Regression 2 we test this hypothesis by interacting an Empire dummy variable with
the macroeconomic variables DEBT and INFL. The hypothesis is rejected at usual
significance levels. Default prospects were not priced significantly differently
in Empire countries by this yardstick either, despite a faint hint of stronger debt
punishment for non-empire borrowers.
GDP and a more widespread adherence to the gold standard. For the pre-1914 period, Flandreau
et al. investigate borrowing spreads over London using a country sample different from that of
Bordo and Rockoff (1996) and an econometric specification encompassing the public debt ratio to
GDP as well as gold standard adherence. Unlike us, they find a strong positive effect of public
debt on borrowing spreads even under the classical gold standard (and even in a linear model of
spread determination). Unfortunately, we have not been able to obtain their complete data set,
which includes some “European peripheral” countries with highly indebted governments, so we
cannot say for sure whether differences in the country sample drive the discrepancy in results. The
Flandreau et al. estimates of the value of gold standard adherence before 1914 are, as we noted
above, similar to those that we and Bordo and Rockoff find.

22

In Regression 4 we assess the impact of the two economic additional control
variables EXPORTS and LOGY. Export ratios seem to have had no statistically
significant impact on the risk premium, but the level of development turns out
to be highly statistically significant, as might have been expected. “Less developed” countries (as measured by income per capita) faced higher country risk. As
noted, the statement of this result is simpler than its interpretation. Does LOGY
measure some economic attraction such as productivity? Or is it a proxy for
some institutional development, whether legal, financial or political? Whatever its
meaning—it is perhaps best seen as a continuous alternative to the dichotomous
periphery dummy—we find strong evidence to support the inclusion of such a
control variable. However, its inclusion alters none of our previous main findings.
In particular, debt appears not to matter and the inflation coefficient, while of the
right sign, is statistically insignificant.
For a final sensitivity check we adopted a different specification than any employed in the literature so far, and one that might be more robust since it does not
depend on such strong assumptions. First, we augment the model (1) to include a
lagged dependent variable, so that we estimate
SPREADit = αi + φ(L)SPREAD it + βi SPREADW ,t + γ Xit + uit ,

(2)

where φ(L) is a polynomial in positive powers of the lag operator L. We retain fixed
effects and possible serial correlation. This choice of model could be justified on a
number of grounds. Lagged-dependent variable models can be hard to distinguish
from the previous AR1 models we have used, but they might better approximate
bond market behavior if agents employ Bayesian updating of country risk. In that
setting, today’s predicted risk is a linear combination of lagged risk and today’s
new information. Thus, deviations from steady state risk may persist for a long
time, whereas in the simple AR1 model the fitted value adjusts immediately and
only the error term has persistence.
Naturally, such a flexible form as this calls for a different estimation strategy.
Panel fixed effects with lagged dependent variables induce bias in OLS estimates,
and the solution is to use the generalised method of moments (GMM). We employ
the Arellano and Bond (1991) one-step dynamic panel estimator, treating the world
risk and gold standard variables as exogenous, and the lagged debt and inflation
terms as endogenous but predetermined. The model is estimated in differences
using at least twice lagged levels of the endogenous variables as instruments.
Selected results are shown in Table 3, and, despite the very different estimation

23

strategy, they show a basic consistency with the message from Tables 1 and 2.19
The long-run effect of the gold standard on country risk is now about 65 basis
points and generally statistically significant, suggesting that the Bordo-Rockoff
methodology might have slightly understated the benefits of the gold standard. The
other coefficients are statistically insignificant, although inflation has economically
significant estimated effects across the four specifications. In the final column
EXPORTS is statistically insignificant, and LOGY has a marginal significance
level (8 perecent), leading us to select the first column as our preferred GMM
prewar specification. Since the GMM model is estimated in differences, all fixed
effects drop out, meaning that this framework is necessarily silent on the “Empire
effect.”
Like Bordo and Rockoff (1996), we conclude overall that the main significant
policy determinant of country risk in the prewar period appears to have been gold
standard adherence. Gold was apparently a good enough seal of approval by itself,
and risk was priced without much reference to public debt levels, inflation, or
whether the country was core or periphery, empire or nonempire.

3.2 Interwar findings, 1925–31
Most narrative accounts of the transition from the classical gold standard to the
interwar period stress one key difference: the rebuilt gold standard was a pale
imitation of its predecessor. It did not long endure, and seemed to lack both
credibility and stability. As Temin (1989, p. 33) remarks, “The combination of
changed conditions and some policy choices of the 1920s … created great strains
in the operation of the interwar gold standard.”
The key question is whether such a regime change can be detected in the data.
To that end we repeat the previous country risk modelling exercise for the period 1925–31. One difficulty here is that after 1914, many countries suspended
and then resumed the gold standard at new, devalued parities that partially expropriated prior bondholders. In a conventional view of reputation (Bordo and
Kydland, 1995), devaluation would be viewed with suspicion by markets, and fear
of such reactions prompted some governments to deflate in order to restore prewar
parities—Churchill’s pursuit of $4.86 is perhaps the most famous example. To
account for differential market treatment of par maintainers and par adjusters, we
use the policy dummy variables GSPAR and GSDEV described at the start of this
19 In

these regressions, preliminary analysis indicated the need for two lags to ensure no second
order residual autocorrelation.

section, as suggested Bordo, Edelstein, and Rockoff (1999). A second problem
concerns departures from gold in the gathering crisis of 1929–31. It is implausible
that Australia, for example, could have avoided an increase in borrowing spreads
in 1930 simply by somehow clinging to the gold standard and its rules. Since we
therefore do not want to impute such spread increases to departures from gold per
se, we introduce the new dummy variable GSOFF. A third difficulty is that whereas
previously we had up to 44 observations per country in the time dimension, we now
have at most 7; it is therefore unwise to estimate country-specific autoregressive
parameters ρi , so we adopt a specification with ρi = ρ for all countries.
Tables 4 and 5 can be directly compared with Tables 1 and 2. Table 4 shows the
interwar analysis for the full sample, 143 observations, with no additional controls.
Regression 1 in Table 4 suggests that unconditionally (that is, without reference
to the restoration of the prewar parity), the gold standard had at best a minimal
impact on spreads (10 basis points). And even this small estimated effect is far
from statistical significance. Regression 2 partitions the GS dummy to account for
postwar devaluations. According to these estimates, countries returning to gold at
the prewar parities gained nothing in reduced spreads (indeed the sign of GSPAR
is wrong), whereas countries like France that returned after devaluing received
a benefit of roughly 35 basis points that falls just shy of conventional statistical
significance levels.
These findings run quite contrary to the Bordo-Edelstein-Rockoff empirical
results. Echoing the conventional wisdom of interwar policymakers, they found
that sticking to the prewar parity was rewarded by markets with a continued (and
large) discount on borrowing costs of over 100 basis points. But countries that
resumed at a devalued parity gained nothing, as their credibility was damaged. We
note that in both regressions of Table 4 the variable GSOFF has a large coefficient
(60–70 basis points) and is highly significant. Spreads rose sharply for primary
exporters like Australia, Argentina, and Uruguay that left gold before Britain did.
Were we to omit the variable GSOFF, we would find approximately a −30 basis
point coefficient on GSPAR and a −50 basis point coefficient on GSDEV (see
Obstfeld and Taylor 2003), but as we have argued, these seeming benefits of gold
adherence would be an artefact of the harsh external conditions peripheral countries
faced at the onset of the Great Depression. Consistent with that interpretation, we
note that if we omit the GSOFF dummy but drop the crisis year 1931, the results
move closer to those in Table 4.20
20 As

we explain in the appendix, there is disagreement among scholars as to whether Uruguay
could be considered to be on gold in 1928–29. We believe that the markets took the country’s de

What could possibly explain our result—a reversal of the classic ideology—
according to which parity keepers gain nothing, and the market, if anything, rewards devaluers? The result is not so far fetched when markets try to assess which
promises actually can be kept. In this respect, our findings support the theoretical
conclusion of Drazen and Masson (1994) that policymakers may hurt rather than
enhance their credibility through policies that appear “tough” in the short term but
are too draconian to be sustained for long. These initial results are far from conclusive, of course, given the moderate statistical significance of the gold standard
effect, but the question certainly warrants further research.
Our findings are so obviously at variance with the results of Bordo-EdelsteinRockoff that some explanation is needed. The contrast could be ascribed to differences in concept (use of secondary-market bond yields, mostly in London, versus
new issue yields in New York) and differences in estimation method. Of these
features in our empirical approach, the first, at least, seems necessary if we are
to make comparisons on an equal footing with the prewar period and Bordo and
Rockoff (1996). For the same reason an autoregressive correction of some sort
would seem essential, although Bordo, Rockoff, and Edelstein (1999) used simple
OLS. One reason for their choice, we think, was an unfortunate feature of Cleona
Lewis’s interwar data on New York bond issues: these were primary issues, so not
every country had a bond issue every year, leading to gaps in the time series, and
hence the impossibility of an AR1 correction. A more subtle difficulty, which our
approach confronts, is an inherent problem of sample selection bias when using
primary-issue data of Lewis’s kind. Countries tend only to float bonds when they
are creditworthy, so this yields a biased sample, as noted earlier. In contrast, by
using secondary market data from London, we can track countries in all years,
whatever their predicament.
Table 5 adds additional controls. The coefficient of GSDEV is virtually the
same—roughly 35 basis points, a number smaller than our estimated reward for
prewar adherence to gold—but it becomes statistically significant. In addition,
GSPAR remains essentially zero while GSOFF is slightly lower but still highly
significant. In contrast to the prewar results, public debt now has a statistically
significant positive effect on borrowing costs. This is a second key contrast with
the classical prewar gold standard. All four regressions in Table 5 indicate that
facto gold adherence at its prewar parity seriously (and indeed, the country’s borrowing spreads
were somewhat lower in 1928–29 than before or after). However, the only significant effect (in all
our regressions) of adopting the alternative coding for Uruguay is to reduce the measured effect of
GSOFF. This result is expected because a relatively small group of countries left gold before June
1931 and Uruguay suffered a large increase in its borrowing spread.

although the markets cared little about being on gold in the interwar period, they
did care about public debt levels. For example, a coefficient of 1.41 on DEBT in
our table (Regression 1) means that a 10 percentage point increase in a country’s
debt to GDP ratio would be expected to raise country risk by 14.1 basis points.
Inflation is never statistically significant. Regressions 2 and 3 of Table 5 allow
for the inclusion of periphery and empire interaction terms, but, based on their
statistical significance, they do not seem to be justified. Regression 4 adds controls
for the export ratio and level of development. Exports are incorrectly signed but
statistically quite insignificant. The income coefficient is, however, statistically
significant and somewhat larger than in the prewar results in Table 2. Once again,
we caution that the interpretation of the LOGY variable is unclear since it could
be a proxy for various institutional, economic or other factors affecting risk. Even
so, in our AR1 models it appears to have a robust and fairly stable coefficient both
prewar and interwar, so we again choose the final column as our preferred AR1
specification.
When compared to our earlier prewar findings based on the same specifications,
these results show that the value of being on gold at the traditional parity fell to
zero after the war. Based on the latter, the bottom line for the interwar period could
then be summed up as: the gold standard strikes out but the Empire strikes back.
Table5 suggests that the value of being in the Empire was much higher than being
on gold, and much higher than it had been prior to the war. Based on the analysis of
mean fixed effects, an Empire member might have expected a borrowing discount
of anywhere between 180 and 230 basis points.
This finding makes intuitive sense. Prior to World War One, the long trend of
globalisation in the world economy and a convergence on a set of more or less liberal
economic policy principles (a kind of “London consensus”) had placed economic
actions at centre stage in the minds of market actors. The sudden specter of total
war, the shock of political instability and revolution, the rise of belligerence in the
core economies, and a general air of noncooperative policymaking could well have
changed the weight given to various signals in the world bond market. Suddenly,
the safe haven of Empire investments might have looked more attractive, just as the
gold standard began to lose its glitter. And, more generally, this interpretation sits
comfortably with the conventional wisdom that the world economy as a whole was
becoming increasingly organised along regional, bilateral, or imperial lines in the
interwar years, due to preferential policies in both trade and finance. For example,
after the onset of war, in the 1910s and 1920s, Britain began to curtail nonempire
access to the London capital market and by the 1930s the British Empire had
become a heavily protected trading zone under the auspices of the Ottawa accords.
30

In a further sensitivity check, Table 6 reports GMM estimates for a laggeddependent-variable model of spreads. Using the Arellano and Bond (1991) onestep dynamic panel estimator once again, we find results broadly consistent with
the AR1 estimates from Tables 4 and 5, although standard errors are much higher—
which is perhaps no surprise given the shortness of the interwar panel and the loss
of one cross-section due to differencing. Here, returning to the gold standard
at the prewar parity appears to have yielded no reduction in spreads, but parity
devaluation shows a risk reduction somewhere around 20 basis points, an effect that
is economically but not statistically significant. Debt generally was punished by the
markets, more harshly on the periphery and perhaps outside the Empire. Inflation
appears not to matter except for column 3 where the effects are implausibly large
and offsetting in empire and nonempire cases. This strange result argues against
such a specification. In our preferred specification, reported in the last column, the
long-run coefficient on debt is higher than in Table 5. Importantly, Tables 4 and
5 consistently show that interwar debt effects were large and positive compared
to the (statistically insignificant and often wrongly signed) impacts found for the
prewar period in Tables 2 and 3. Also in the GMM interwar regressions in Table 6,
we find, as before, that higher income per capita reduced spreads.
To summarise, by the late 1920s the market’s approach to risk pricing had
changed dramatically. If markets rewarded gold adherence at all, they did so only
when the adoption of gold was based upon a realistically competitive exchange
rate. In addition, policymakers faced a world in which the mere word of their
commitment to the gold standard was no longer good enough—now creditors also
wanted to see the books.

4 Conclusion
In the sovereign bond market before 1914, the gold standard did indeed confer a
“seal of approval,” whereas macro fundamentals, measured by public debt and inflation, seem to have mattered little, if at all. Apparently adherence to gold, in and
of itself, was sufficient to enhance market credibility during that era. Membership
in the British Empire was neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for preferential access to London’s capital market before 1914. The results accord with
historians’ views on the high degree of economic globalisation attained before the
First World War.
For the interwar period, a return to gold after devaluation seems to have been
more credible, notwithstanding the arguments that led Britain and other countries

to return to gold at par. Indeed, returning at par yielded essentially no benefit, and
only a return after devaluation (as in the case of France) was beneficial, though
not quite as beneficial as being on gold prior to World War One. Moreover, for
core and periphery countries alike, high public debts were punished, suggesting
that policymakers’ room for maneuver had been curtailed. In the troubled interwar
environment, Empire membership emerged as an important qualification for lower
borrowing costs.
Both our results on the drop in spreads associated with going on gold, and
on markets’ differential response to public debt before and after the war, suggest
that the interwar gold standard was less credible than its pre-1914 predecessor. It
remains to reconcile these results fully with findings such as those of Hallwood,
MacDonald, and Marsh (1996) that indicate a credible gold standard during the
late 1920s, at least in the short-term bond markets. Perhaps the bond markets
adopted a longer perspective under which protracted adherence to unchanging gold
parities seemed less probable than short-term adherence. The question certainly
deserves further research, but our findings on bond markets serve to illuminate how
different the interwar global capital market was from its antecedent, the classical
gold-standard regime of 1870–1914. Evidently the global convergence in the
bond market prior to 1914 was replaced by quite different, disintegrative forces
after 1914.
Finally, if we seek lessons from the past, our results have some implications
for today’s attempts to gain capital market credibility through the use of pegged
exchange rates. It is clear that the post-World War One political developments that
rendered interwar exchange-rate commitments less credible have not receded in
the meantime. Thus, policymakers should not expect to gain market credibility
even through seemingly irrevocable exchange rate commitments. Absent robust
fundamentals and complementary economic and institutional reforms, efforts to
forswear discretionary exchange rate changes are of questionable value.

Data Appendix
The database covers the period 1870 to 1939 at an annual frequency. The core countries
are defined as Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, New Zealand,
Norway, Sweden, and the United States. The empire countries are defined as Australia,
Canada, India, New Zealand, and South Africa. The peripheral countries are defined as
Argentina, Austria (and Austria-Hungary), Brazil, Chile, Egypt, Finland, Greece, Hungary,
India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, and Uruguay. The base
country for yields is the United Kingdom. Before World War One, Turkey refers to the
Ottoman Empire and Austria denotes Austria-Hungary (and there are no independent data
for Hungary). There are missing data for most variables.

Exchange rate
Exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar from Bordo and Schwartz (1997) and Global Financial
Data (GFD), except as follows.
Argentina: from della Paolera and Taylor (2001).
Chile: 1870–79 annual average from Braun et al. (2000).

Gold standard
The gold standard dummy variable is equal to one when a country is on the gold standard,
otherwise zero. The gold standard parity dummy (GSPAR) is equal to one when a country
rejoins gold after 1914 at parity that is the same as the previous one. The gold standard
devalued dummy (GSDEV) is equal to one when a country rejoins gold at parity after 1914
that is devalued relative to the previous one. (There are cases where countries rejoined
gold at a revalued parity, such as India in the 1920s, but these are not coded in any special
way.)
Prewar coding. Data are from Meissner (2002), available for all countries in all years,
except as follows:
Argentina: On gold for 1899–1902 (see della Paolera and Taylor, 2001).
Belgium: Off gold in 1926 (see Eichengreen, 1992, p. 168 et seq.).
India: Off gold 1870–97 following Hawtrey (1947) and Eichengreen (1992) and based
on exchange rate volatility.
Uruguay: On gold for 1885–99 (Luis Bértola, private communication; we have no
exchange rate data for Uruguay prior to 1885 to verify adherence).
Interwar coding. As discussed in the text, the interwar coding of gold standard adherence involves greater subjective judgment than for the prewar period. In addition, because
we use June observations for the interwar period, annual summaries of adherence are
patently insufficient; we must know the month, and in some cases the day, of entry to or

34

exit from the gold standard. We do not attempt to distinguish among various degrees of
adherence, that is, gold bullion standard, gold coin standard, or gold exchange standard.
In most cases, however, we demand not only that a currency be stable de facto in terms
of gold, but that it be convertible de jure, with the free import and export of gold allowed
by the issuing country. Countries on gold are considered to leave the gold standard if they
prohibit cross-border gold flows or impose other exchange controls, even if they do not
simultaneously devalue or float their currencies.
The dates that we use for the interwar transitions to and from the gold standard are as
follows:

Brazil: The “on gold” date is for de facto adoption of a gold peg through a currency
reform law. See Fritsch (1988, p. 122). The departure date, from Fritsch (p. 156), is the
day on which the Banco do Brasil withdrew foreign exchange support. Fritsch (p. 122–23)
explains that the currency reform law provided for a phased transition from de facto to
de jure convertibility, with the date of de jure credibility left open and dependent on the
level of government gold holdings. Brazil left gold, however, before the transition was
completed. Because Brazil’s adherence to gold was codified in legislation, we use the date
of passage as our “on gold” date.
Canada: Shearer and Clark (1984, pp. 282 and 297) and Brown (1940, pp. 396 and

sterling, as reported in GFD, and Britain’s date of adherence to gold. The “off gold” date
is from Brown (1940, p. 1075).
Finland: Brown (1940, pp. 396 and 1075).

behaviour, as reported in GFD. December 1929 date for gold abandonment from Brown
(1940, p. 893) and Kindleberger (1986, p. 89), though the currency was allowed to
depreciate below par in April 1929. According to a private communication from Luis
Bértola, Uruguay never returned to gold after August 1914; instead it simply pegged the
exchange rate. Brown’s account suggests, however, that contemporaries viewed Uruguay,
like its larger neighbor Argentina, as being effectively on gold, and we take that view in
our coding. In the text we discuss how our results change if Uruguay is considered to be
off gold throughout 1925–31.
United States: Brown (1940, pp. 207–8 and 1075).
