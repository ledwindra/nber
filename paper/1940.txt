Political

Parties and the Business Cycle
in the United States, 1948—1984

ABSTRACT

This paper tests the existence and the extent of a politically

induced business cycle in the U.S. in the post—World War II period. The
cycle described in this paper is different from the traditional

"political business cycle" of Nordhaus. It is based on a systematic
difference between the monetary policies of the two parties in a model

with labor contracts. From an explicit optimization problem we derive a
system of equations for output and money growth. Then we successfully
test the non-linear restriction imposed by the theory on the parameters

of the system of equations. We cannot reject the hypothesis that money
growth has been systematically different under the two types of
administration and that this difference contributes to explain output
fluctuations.

Introduction

The most famous attempt to model the relationship between political
and economic cycles is the "political business cycle" theory formulated

by Nordhaus (1915) and McRae (1971). Three crucial assumptions underly
this approach: (i) the parties are "office motivated," in the sense
that they care only about winning the elections, as in Downs (1957);
(ii) voters are not forward—looking and have short memories, so that
they can be systematically fooled;1 and (iii) the economy is described
by an exploitable Phillips curve and the rational expectations critique
is not taken into account.

The results derived by Nordhaus on the basis of these assumptions

are well—known. The incumbent stimulates the economy and reduces
unemployment close to election time in order to increase Its chances of

reelection. At the beginning of the new term, the inflationary effects
of the pre-electoral expansion are eliminated with a recession. The
behavior of the two parties is identical, and a cycle results in
equilibrium.

The empirical evidence in support of the "political business cycle"
theory is rather weak for the U.S. ease; in fact this theory has been
rejected by several authors using post—Second World War U.S. data.
Given these rejections, an increasing number of empirical studies

have moved toward a "partisan theory" of macroeconomic policy. The
original proponent of this view was Hibbs (1917). This author argued
that the Democratic Party in the U.S. and socialist parties in Europe
have been more averse to unemployment and less averse to inflation than
the Republican party in the U.S. and conservative parties in Europe.

This theory has been tested empirically by Hibbs and others, using
models based on an exploitable Phillips curve with no consideration for
the rational expectations critique.

In this paper a model closely related to that of Alesina (1985a) is

presented and tested on post—Second World War U.S. data. The model is
based on a "partisan view" of political parties but, contrary to
literature on the subject, it accounts for rational and forward—looking

expectations. In this model only "unexpected policy" matters; the
economy would exhibit policy neutrality features in a one-party system

with no elections. However, the elections create an important source of
uncertainty about the future: the economic agents do not know which
party will win the following election. If the relevant expectations
about monetary policy and inflation have to be formed before elections,
they are based on the averages of the policies that the two parties are

expected to follow once elected. If these policies are different the
elected party creates a surprise, in the sense that its policy was not
correctly predicted, since expectations accounted for the possibility of

the election of the other party. The model, then, predicts that at the
beginning of the term in office of the more expansionary party one
should observe an output expansion above trend with high money growth.
Instead, when the less expansionary party is elected, a recession with

low money growth should be observed. There are no electoral surprises
in the second part of any administration; henoe, the model predicts

policy neutrality. Then, in the second part of both types of
administrations real variables should exhibit the same behavior

(ceteris paribus). However, it will be shown that even in the second

5

part of the term in office the rate of money creation should be
different depending on the party in office.
Starting from an explicit maximization problem, we derive the

reaction functions of the two parties and their time consistent policies
and test the nonlinear restrictions on the parameters imposed by the

theory. This procedure makes it possible to estimate directly the
parameters of the objective functions of the two parties. The sample
used covers the nine completed administrations of the post—World War II
period, from President Truman through the first term of President
Reagan.

The data do not reject the assumption that there is a difference

between the objective functions of the two parties. The Democratic
administrations have been relatively more concerned about the output
target rather than the inflation/money creation target than the

Republican administrations. Furthermore, the empirical results do not
reject the hypothesis that systematic differences in output growth have
occurred in the first half of the administrations and not in the second,

in accordance with the theory. Thus, these results support a partisan
view of monetary policy (and in general of macropolicy) rather than a

political business cycle view. The only exception to this conclusion is
perhaps the first Nixon administration, the behavior of which is
probably better explained by a "political business cycle" view.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews some
of the recent empirical literature on the subject. Section 3 presents
the model and derives the empirical implications of it. Section 4
provides empirical evidence in accordance with the qualitative

implications of the model. In Section 5 the empirical estimates of the

6

parameters of the model are presented and discussed. The concluding
section summarizes briefly the major findings and identifies several
open questions.

2. Political Business Cycle Theory and Partisan Theory

In his seminal article, Nordhaus (1975) provides suggestive
empirical evidence in favor of the "political business cycle" hypothesis

(henceforth PBC). This evidence appears favorable for the U.S. but
rather mixed for several other countries.2 In particular, Nordhaus
writes that the first Nixon administration is a "textbook example" of
PBC because of the inflationary expansion skillfully placed close to the

elections of 1972. However, the empirical work that has followed has
led to the conclusion that the first Nixon administration was probably
the only clear case of PBC in the post-Second World War period in the

U.S. NcCallum (1978), Golden—Foterba (1980), Beck (1982 and 19810,
Abrams—Froyen—Waud (1983), Hibbs (1977 and 1985), Chapell—Keech (1986),
and Havrileski (1985) all reject directly or indirectly the PBC

hypothesis. Hibbs (1985), for example, concludes that there is "no
persuasive evidence that presidential election years, viewed together,

generally have been occasions of unusual monetary and fiscal expansions

or of short run surges in output, real incomes, and employment." The
lack of strong empirical support for the PBC has led Alt—Chrystal (1983)
to conclude that "no one could read the political business cycle
literature without being struck by the lack of supporting evidence."3
On the other hand, Tufte (1978) finds some support for the PBC.

This author finds evidence of short run increases in transfers in

7

electoral years. Hibbs (1985) confirms these findings, but nonetheless
they rail to provide convincing support for the general implications of
the PBC for the cycle of inflation and unemployment or output.
The lack of empirical support for the PBC has led to an increasing
amount of work directed toward testing a "partisan theory" (henceforth
PT) of macroeconomic policy and, in particular, of monetary policy.
This view was formulated in the seminal contribution of Hibbs (1977).
This author argued that leftist parties in Europe and the Democratic
party in the U.S. have been more likely to choose a point on the
Phillips curve with higher inflation and less unemployment than
conservative parties in Europe and the Republican party in the U.S.
Hibbs claims that the lower middle class and the working class benefit
from a policy of low unemployment and relatively high inflation and

these social groups tend to support the left. This view is clearly
summarized by Paul Samuelson, who wrote in 1977: "We tend to get our
recessions during Republican administrations.... The difference between
the Democrats and the Republicans is the difference in their

constituencies. It's a class difference ...

the

Democrats constitute

the people, by and large, who are around the median incomes or below.
They are the ones whom the Republicans want to pay the price of fighting

inflation. The Democrats [are] willing to run with some inflation
the Republicans are not" (Samuelson (1977)). The events that followed
1977 hardly could have changed Samuelson's view of the subject. Very
similar views are expressed by Okun (1973), in disagreement with Stigler

(1973). Stein (1985) stresses that employment and growth were always
top priority for Democratic administrations after the Second World War,
while inflation was the first priority for Republican administrations.

8

Kiewiet (1985) tests the hypothesis that voters in the U.S. did in fact

recognize the Democratic party as the one that tights unemployment and

the Republican party as the one that fights inflation. The author finds
that this hypothesis is supported by the empirical evidence.
Beck (19814) finds virtually no evidence in favor of the FBC and

concludes that monetary policy has been looser under Democratic
presidents than under Republican presidents; however, he finds that the

Kennedy and first Nixon administrations do not fit this pattern. On the
basis of these two exceptions he raises a word of caution with respect

to the PT as formulated by Hibbs. Beck claims that different
administrations of the same party have behaved differently; therefore,

"administrations" more than parties are what really count.
Nevertheless, despite this important consideration the PT is not

rejected by Beck's results. Furthermore, note that only the Nixon
exception is really problematic for the PT; this administration probably
behaved in a way more consistent with the FEC than with the PT.

In the

case of the Kennedy administration the crucial fact is that the economy
was stimulated through fiscal rather than monetary expansion; this does
not imply that the FEC approach would fit the Kennedy administration
better than the PT.

Havrileski (1985) finds that changes of administrations from
Republican to Democratic have been asssociated with upward jumps in
money growth; conversely, downward jumps are observed when a Republican
administration is elected after a Democratic one.5
Chapell—Keech (1986) refer to results on unemployment that are

"quite similar in magnitude to those reported by Hibbs." The authors
also suggest that differences in the rates of unemployment under the

9

administrations of the two parties tend to become smaller in the latter

part of the term. The explanation given for this phenomenon is very
similar to that suggested in this paper but the authors do not present
an explicit formalization of this problem.

Finally, note that systematically different monetary policies
between parties should imply a systematically different behavior of the

exchange rate. Preliminary results of Hansson (1985) show that since
the beginning of the floating regime, the U.S. dollar has shown a

tendency toward appreciation during Republican administrations and
toward depreciation during the Democratic administration of President
Carter.

Virtually all the empirical literature on policy choices on a
Phillips curve utilize models in which little attention, if any, is

devoted to incorporating rational expectations.6 The presumption of
many authors was that in models characterized by policy neutrality most

of the interest for the PT or for the PBC is lost. Secondly, almost no
attempt has been made to estimate the parameters of the policymakers'

objective functions. In fact, an explicit maximization problem of
parties' objective functions generally is not solved in order to derive

testable reduced forms.7 The model presented in the next section
incorporates both features: rational, forward—looking agents and an
explicit solution of the policymakers' maximization problem.

3. The Model

There are two parties, denoted with obvious reference party D and

party R. The two parties assign different weights to two policy

10

targets: an inflation rate or money growth target and an output growth
target. The policy instrument controlled by the policymaker is the rate
of money creation. A quadratic specification for the objective
functions of the two parties is adopted so that the loss function of the
two parties can be written as (the superscripts characterize the party):

t [ (m - (t)]2

zD

qt

where m =

]

(1)

(2)

of growth of GNP; a, 5, c, •,

and a are non—negative parameters; and q is the discount factor,
positive but less than one.

The economy is described by the following equation for output
growth:

y(t) + Y(mt —

Equation (3) incorporates the basic properties of a Lucas supply
function in which only unexpected nominal shocks affect real variables.

In (3) we indicated with (t) the rate of growth generated by the
economy in the absence of monetary shocks; this rate is not assumed

constant. Also, m is the rational expectation of rnformed in period
t -

1

on the basis of the information available at that time. The

objective functions (1) and (2) are in the information set of the
agents.

•11

The objective functions could have been written with an inflation
target instead of the money growth target, and the supply equation

could have been written as a function of unexpected inflation. This
alternative specification could have been closed by a simple money
demand equation such as

mt = Ut +

(14)

where 11 is the inflation rate and a is a constant. The shortcut adopted
here keeps the algebra simpler, saves degrees of freedom, and it should

not affect qualitatively the empirical results. The choice of a target
in terms of rate of growth of output instead of a level of GNP (or of
unemployment) is imposed by theoretical and empirical considerations.
If a target in level of output were chosen, one would have needed a more
complex dynamic structure for the supply equations, involving one or

more lags, for example. This procedure would have reduced the already
scarce degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the solution of the model and
the computation of the Nash equilibrium would have been much more

problematic and difficult to test empirically. This is an open question
to be addressed in future research
The targets on money growth and output growth are assumed identical

for the two parties: the difference in the objective functions is
constrained to be in the relative weights attributed to identical

targets. This restriction, imposed to conserve degrees of freedom,
should not affect the nature of the results. Finally, the targeted
level of money growth, 4'(t), is allowed to change over time, to reflect
velocity shifts in ('T).

12

In this paper, no distinction is made between the "administration"

and the Central Bank. The implicit assumption, shared with most of the
literature on the PBC versus the PT, is that the administration has some
control over monetary policy, despite the relative independence of the

Central Bank. Weintraub (1978) argues that this is, in fact, a
realistic assumption. Stein (1985) provides several examples of cases
in which the Fed has accommodated the "desire" of the President. Grier
(1985) discusses and tests the degree of effective independence of the

Federal Reserve from both the Congress and the President. The degree cf
independence of the Federal Reserve from the administration is an
important and open question that would probably deserve a separate

treatment. Here it is assumed that the Federal Reserve cannot choose a
monetary pclicy independently from the administration.

As long as p > (t) and b and d are positive, both parties face the
problem of dynamic inconsistency of optimal monetary policy, as pointed

out originally by Kydland—Prescott (1977). If the targeted level of

output growth, ,

is

higher than the growth rate generated by the

market, (t), the policymaker has an incentive to generate policy
surprises in order to approach the target. In fact, by substituting
(3) into (1) and (2), one gets:

In order to identify

the problem of' dynamic inconsistency, consider, for example, party D

acting as "dictator," with no elections. If this party could make a
binding commitment it would choose to commit to the rule:

tnt =

This

(9)

'pR)

rule is obtained by minimizing (5), taking account of' the

rationality of expectations, i.e., mt =

m.

However, binding

commitments are hardly available: the policymaker can always change
both its mind and the law. Then the time consistent rate of money
growth has to be found by minimizing (5) taking expectations as given.
This procedure leads to:

=

a

b

*(t) +

a

k(t)J

(10)

Solving for rational expectations, one gets:

=

mt

=

ip(t)

+

k(t)

(11)

114

In (11) the term b/a k(t) is the inflationary bias introduced into the

economy by the absence of binding commitments. Note that this bias
would be zero if and only if either b = 0 and/or 37(t) =
k(t) =

0).

(that is,

The bias is higher the higher is the targeted rate of growth

of GNP relative to the rate of growth generated by the economy, and the
higher the weight attributed by the policymaker to the output target

relative to the money growth target. Note that, irrespective of the
level of the time-consistent rate of money growth, output growth is at
the level determined by the economy without policy intervention, because

money creation is perfectly anticipated. Furthermore, a fall in the
rate of growth of output generated by the market implies a higher rate

of inflation. In fact, a fall in 37(t) implies an increase in k(t). The
implication is that a negative trend of output growth could be
associated with an increasing trend of inflation, if the preferences of
the policymakers do not change.

Let us now consider the interaction of the two parties. It is
assumed that elections take place every two periods and are held at the

beginning of the period. After the elections of, say, time t, the
elected party chooses its policy for period t (i.e., mt). The electoral
outcomes are uncertain. Party D is elected with probability P and
party R with probability 1 — P.

The probability P is taken as an

exogenous parameter and it is "common knowledge"; thus, it is in the

information set of agents. Alesina (1985b) shows how this assumption
could be generalized to the case of rational and forward—looking voters.

The crucial assumption is that, if voters are forward—looking (as they
should be!) and they know the objective functions of the two parties,
the policy chosen by the elected party at time t does not influence its

15

2.

chances of reelection at time t +

In fact, the probability of

electing a party is a function of the expected future policies of the

two parties. If voters know the objective functions of the two parties,
they do not need the information of today's policy to form expectations
about tomorrow's policies.

If party D is elected, it minimizes (6). The first order condition
is:

where g =

= (1

g)p(t)

b/(b

a).

g(m +

k(t))

(12)

If party R is elected, it minimizes (7). The

corresponding first order condition is:

(13)

Expectations are given by:

—

if t is an election year;

=

m÷1

if party D is elected at time t;

rn!41 =

m1

if party B is elected at time t.

(111)

Equation (110 underscores the idea that there is uncertainty in
expectation formation only in the first period of an administration.
The assumption that administrations last two periods implies for

the U.S. that a period is of two years. This assumption is consistent,
for example, with the existence of overlapping labor contracts of an

average length of two years (see Taylor, 1980, or Fischer, 1977). In

16

more general terms, this assumption requires some form of stickiness in
the price system such that the economy does not adjust "too quickly" to
an unexpected monetary shock.8

For the empirical estimation of the model it is assumed that both
(t) and ip(t)

are

linear trends:

The assumption that the optimal rate of money growth is not constant,
but increasing over time, captures the positive time trend in this

variable. Then, given (12), (13), (i'D, (15), and (16), some algebra
establishes that:

stand for the first and second periods of D and H administrations.
Equations (17) to (211) embody several empirical implications:

In the second half of both administrations there are no policy

1

surprises; therefore, output growth is at the level determined by the

— t.

market without policy intervention, S?

2. If g > h there is a recession in the first half of an H

administration and an expansion above trend in the first half of a

D administration (equations (17) and (19)). The deviations of output
growth from trend, 7 —

t,

are bigger the more different are g and h,

i.e., the greater the difference in the relative weights attributed
by the two parties to the two targets.
3.

The more unexpected the electoral outcome, the bigger is the
deviation of output growth from trend. For example, if P is high and
party H is elected, the model predicts a deep recession. The reverse
holds if party D is elected and P is low. The more surprising is the
electoral result, the greater the discrepancy between the expected m
and its actual value.

1L If g > h the time consistent rate of money growth is higher for party
D than for party H in both periods (equations (21) to (211)).

5. If g > h ) 0, in a D administration the rate of money creation
deviates from trend more in the seoond period than in the first; the
opposite holds for the administrations of party H (equations (21) to
(211)).

If

h = 0 there are no deviations from trend in both periods

of a Republican administration. The intuition is that in a D
administration expectations are adjusted upward in the second period,

18

when there is certainty that the more expansionary party is in

office. Therefore, the time consistent rate of money creation is
higher: the policyrnaker is forced to accommodate these expectations,

in order to avoid a recession. The opposite holds for the less
expansionary party. If ii =

0,

party R is not affected by the problem

of dynamic inconsistency of monetary policy, because this party would

have no incentive to generate policy surprises. In this ease the
optimal monetary policy is time—oonsistent for this party.

The outcome characterized by equations (17) to (21) is the one—

shot discretionary equilibrium without binding commitments. This
equilibrium could be improved upon if reputational strategies were

used in the repeated game. This issue is extensively explored by
Alesina (1985a). In this paper only the one—shot Nash case is
considered.

'I. Preliminary Evidence

This section shows that the qualitative empirical implications of
the model are consistent with U.S. data for the post—Second World War
period.

a. GNP Growth

Table 1 displays the average rate of growth of GNP at 1972 prices
per year for the first and second half of the administration of the two
parties. The averages are taken over the period 19'9—198'T, thus
including nine administrations.(21 Democratic and 5 Republican). In the

second half of the administrations of both parties the average rate of
growth is almost identical, around

percent. The rate of growth in the

first half of Democratic administrations has been higher than in the
second half, while the rate of growth in the first half of Republican
administrations has been much lower than that of the second half.

An even more suggestive piece of evidence is presented in Tables 2

and 3. Table 2 shows the rate of growth of GNP for each year considered
in the sample. If one assumes that after a new administration takes
office there is a lag of a few months between the implementation of the
new policies and their full effect on GNP growth, then in the second
year, more than in the first, the results of the policies of the new

administration should become apparent. The difference in the
performance of the two types of administrations in the second year is

rather striking. The same observation is reinforced by Table 3 which
compares the rate of growth of the second year with the average rate of

growth of the third and fourth years. These tables are self—
explanatory. In the second years of all the Republican administrations
there has been a negative GNP growth. The only two other years of
negative growth in the period examined have been 1971 and 1980, both

years affected by the oil shocks (Table 2). On the contrary, the second
years of Democratic administrations show sustained growth well above the
second half of the term.

The following simple regression accounts for the preceding

observations. The average GNP growth per—year is regressed over the
four dummies for the four periods considered, first and second half of

Democratic administrations, first and second half of Republican

administrations, and a time trend. The variable Dl is a dummy assuming

The coefficient on the second half Republican (R2) is clearly
insignificant, confirming that the data do not show any difference

between the second halves of both administrations. The dummy for the
first half of Republican administrations has, instead, a strongly

significant negative coefficient, as predicted by the theory. The dummy
for the first half of Democrat administrations (Di) has the right sign

even though is not statistically strongly significant. There is a
negative but not statistically significant trend.
Analogous results are obtained by the following additional test.
The quarterly GNP at constant 1972 prices has been regressed on eight
lagged values, a time trend, a dummy for the oil shocks, and two dummies

for the first half of the administrations of the two parties. In
Table 4 the results are displayed. The dummy REL assumes the value of 1
in the first eight quarters of each Republican administration and zero

otherwise. The coefficient of this variable is negative and significant
at the 1 percent level. The dummy DEL assumes the value of 1 in the
first eight quarters of each Democratic administration and zero

otherwise. The coefficient of this variable is positive as predicted by

the theory but it is not strongly significant. The variable OILSH
accounts for the effects of the two oil shocks.9

An additional important empirical observation along these lines is

shown in Table 5. This table displays the timing of the beginning of
all the recessions in relation to the preceding elections. A few months
after the election of every Republican administration a recession

started. There have been no recessions in the first half of a
Democratic administration. A recession started the same month of the
election of Truman in November 19118, and, therefore, two months before

this administration took office. The other two recessions started in
the second half of the Carter administration, at the time of the second
oil shock and in the last year of the second administration of

Eisenhower. Leaving aside the Truman recession, of dubious origin, five
of the seven recessions fit the theory and two do not. Note that the
two that do not fit also contradict the PBC approach because they occur

in the second halves of two administrations. The crucial fact that
discriminates in favor of the approach of this paper rather than the
PBC is that none of the Democratic administrations had recessions at the
beginning of their terms, as the PEC theory predicts.

b. Money Growth

The model implies that the time consistent rate of money creation
of Republican administrations is lower than that or Democratic

administrations, in both periods (first and second half). The following
regression allowing for a linear trend in money growth does not reject
this implication:

The dummy variable for Republican administrations, R, assumes the

value of 1 during Republican administrations and zero otherwise. The
coefficient of this varaible is negative, as predicted by the theory,

and statistically significant at the 5 percent level. As expected there
is a highly significant trend. Beck (19810 pointed out that two
administrations do not quite fit the partisan theory of monetary policy:
the Kennedy administration and the first Nixon administration, beoause
of the tight monetary policy of the former and the 1971—1972 monetary

expansion of the latter. This is indeed the case. By introducing in
the regression (26) a dummy, KN, that assumes the value of —1 in the two
periods of the Kennedy administration and 1 in the second period of the
Nixon administration, one obtains:

=

(7.70)

D.W. = 2.56

The coefficient of H becomes bigger in absolute value and more

significant; the coefficient of KN is also very signifioant. Thus,
equation (27) identifies the two outliers of the regression (26).
The second empirical implication for money growth is that one
should observe a larger deviation from trend in the second halt of a

Democratic administration than in the first. In a Republican

(27)

28

administration, instead, the opposite should hold if h > 0. The
following regression tests these implications:

02 is a dummy assuming the value of 1 in the second halves of Democratic

administrations and zero otherwise. As predicted by the theory, there
is more money creation in the second part of a Democratic administration

than in the first: the coefficient of 02 is in fact positive and large,

although statistically not strongly significant. For the Republican
administration the implications of the theory are rejected: the
relative magnitude of the two coefficients is opposite from what the

theory predicts and the two coefficients are not significant. The
reason for this imperfect fit is, again, to be attributed to the Kennedy

and first Nixon administrations. In fact, by introducing the dummy KN
into the preceding regression we obtain:

mt = 1.58 + 1.19 02 — 1.20 Ri — 1.23 R2 + 2.0'l KN + 0.37

(29)

D.W. = 2.117

The fit of the regression greatly improves. There is virtually no
difference between the coefficients of Ri and H2. This result is
consistent with the prediction of the model for the case of h = 0 (see
equations (17) to (211)). Again, there is more money creation, on

29

average, in the second half of Democratic administrations than in the
first.

Given that the model attributes so much emphasis to unexpected
monetary shocks, the unexpected money variable, 0MB, constructed by

Barro (1978) has been analyzed. This variable is obtained by Barro from
the residual of a regression of the rate of money growth, Ml

,

on several

lagged variables assumed to be in the relevant information set of the

economic agents.10 Biannual averages of this variable (DMR) are
reported in Table 6 (this variable is not available after 1976).

Eleven observations have the expected sign, negative for Republican and

positive for Democratic administrations. Only three observations do not
fit. According to the following simple regression we can reject the
hypothesis of no significant difference in the "money surprises" under
the two types of administration:

Table 5 does not suggest that "surprises" have occurred only in the

first half of the term in office. However, given the different approach
followed by Barro in modeling expectations, the data do not have to
conform necessarily to this pattern.

5. Estimation of the Model

The empirical evidence in the preceding section suggests that the

model is broadly in accordance with the data. In fact, the cross—

equation restrictions imposed by the model cannot be rejected. The
system of equations (114) to (21) has been estamated using LSQ and

testing the nonlinear restrictions on the parameters imposed by the
theory. The only modification from equations (17) to (214) is given by
the introduction of a dummy variable in the output growth equation to
account for the two oil shocks.11

For reasons that will become immediately clear, two results of the

estimation are presented. Table 7 reports the results obtained by
estimating all the parameters of the model except k, fixed at the value

of 1 312 The log likelihood test does not reject the restrictions
imposed by the theory at the 5 percent confidence level.
The estimated values of the parameters are consistent with the

theory. In particular, h =

d) is insignificantly different

b) is positive and significant (0.51).

Note that the regressions (28) and (29) were also consistent with the
assumption of h = 0 in the cost function of party H.

The relative

magnitude of g and h does not reject the hypothesis that the Democratic
administrations have attributed more weight to the output target than
the Republican administrations, that instead have been concerned mainly

(or only, strictly speaking) with the money growth target. This is the
crucial result that discriminates the approach followed in this paper

from the PBC. The latter approach would predict that one should not
observe any difference between the behavior of the two administrations.

The estimated value of I (the effect of unanticipated money on

output growth) is rather high (3.08). This value is, however, not
inconsistent with the findings of Barro (1978). His results cannot be
directly compared with the results of this paper because of the

different specification of the output equation, but the two estimates

have the same order of magnitude.13 The estimated values of I and ,

respectively

3.08 and 11.26, and the value of k, fixed at 1.3, imply that

the targeted level of GNP growth (q) is about 8 peroent. This value is
reasonable given that it is a "bliss point" in the objective functions

of the two parties. The trend in output growth is negative but
insignificant, implying that the "natural" rate of GNP growth is around
11 percent per year.

The estimated value of P, the probability of electing a Democratic
administration, is high, 0.71, implying that Republican administrations

have always been elected with a certain amount of "surprise." The value
of this parameter is due to the fact that the deviation from trend of
output growth at the beginning of Republican administrations has been on

average bigger (in absolute value) than the same deviations at the

beginning of Democratic administrations. This observation was already
apparent from the result of the simple regressions (25) and (26) and
from Table 14

In the simple model used this asymmetry can only be

captured by a high F, implying, oeteris paribus, more surprise when a
Republican president is elected, and, therefore, stronger effects on

output of monetary policy. However, the same phenomenon could be
explained by an asymmetric effect of negative versus positive monetary
shocks due, for example, to different degrees of price flexibility

upward or downward. The issue of the relation between poll predictions
about electoral outcomes and effects of policies needs further

investigation. Needless to say, the probability P is, in general,
different in every election.

3J1

The remaining parameters have the expected sign and order of

magnitude. In particular, there is a positive and significant trend in
the money growth (a is positive and significant);

the oil shocks have

affected negatively output growth in a significant way (the parameter a
is referred to the dummy variable for the oil shocks).
Let us now consider the results obtained by estimating all the

parameters, including k. The results are reported in Table 8. The most
important difference in the two sets of results (Tables 7 and 8) is in
the value of I that is much higher and, probably, nrealistica1ly high

in the new estimations (4.97). Instead, the estimated value of k is
much lower than 1.3, the value to which it was fixed in the preceding

estimation. Furthermore, the t—statistics for I and k are very low; on
the contrary, I was highly significant where k was exogenously fixed

(Table 7). Note, also, that the value of the log likelihood function is
virtually identical in the two regressions, implying that the log
likelihood test is also accepted at the 5 percent level.

This result is

probably an indication of weak identification for the parameters I and

k. Consider, in fact, the output growth equations, here reproduced for

In these equations the parameter k always enters multiplied by Y. The

parameter I also appears multiplied by ,

but

is insignificantly

different from zero. Therefore, the identification of I and k is left
exclusively to the money growth equation. Due to the lack of degrees of
freedom, this identification is probably weak.

6. Summary and Extensions

This paper has provided empirical support to the "partisan view" of

monetary policy. First of all, we could reject the hypothesis that
macroeconomic outcomes have been the same under Democratic and
Republication administrations in the post-Second World War period in the

U.S. We also could not reject the hypothesis that deviation of output
growth from trend occurred mostly in the first halves of the term, as
predicted by the theory; the rate of growth of money, instead, has been
systematically different for the entire term, also as predicted by the

theory. The conclusions that have been inferred from these results are
essentially two. In the first place, Democratic administrations seemed
relatively more concerned with an output target than with a money

growth/inflation target. Second, the real effects of new policies are
stronger in the first halves of new administrations. If a more
expansionary administration is elected, it can take advantage of a short

run Phillips curve. However, once the economy has fully adjusted to the
new regime, the same expansionary policy has little if any effect on
real variables, i.e., the Phillips curve is more (or completely)

vertical. Conversely, there are short run output losses when an
administration more concerned with inflation is elected. These results,

37

then,

reject Nordhaus' formulation of the "political business cycle" and

support a partisan view of maoropolicy.
The analysis of this paper could be extended in several directions.
First, the dynamic structure of the model could be enriched, although

problems of degrees of freedom would arise. Second, attention could be
devoted to the issue of predictability of electoral results. The model
identifies a relation between degree or "surprise" in electoral results

and real effects of monetary policy. This issue could be addressed
directly by using data on prediction polls. Third, systematic
difference in policies of the two parties could be analyzed by looking

at different variables. For example, the stock market and the financial
markets may react to electoral results. Fourth, different countries
could be analyzed using the framework of this paper. Some complications
would arise for parliamentary systems in which the timing of elections
is an endogenous variable.

1. Nordhaus (1975) and McRae (1977) assume irrational voting behavior
in the sense that voters can be systematically fooled by the
incumbent party. Rogoff—Sibert (1985) have obtained some results in
the same spirit as those of Nordhaus—Mcflae in a model with rational
but imperfectly informed voters. This point is also addressed by
Cukierman—Metzler (1985).
