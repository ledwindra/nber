Adoption and Termination of Employee Involvement Programs

ABSTRACT
This study uses a 10-year longitudinal database on U.S. manufacturing establishments to analyze the
dynamics of the adoption and termination of employee involvement programs (EI). We show that
firms' use of EI has not grown continuously, but rather introduce and terminate EI policies in ways
that imply that the policies are complementary with each other and with other advanced human resource
practices, seemingly moving toward an equilibrium distribution of EI policies. Using a Markov model,
we estimate the long-run distribution of the number of EI programs in firms and find that adjustment
to the steady-state distribution takes about 20 years.

Employee involvement (EI) programs—the diverse set of personnel and human
resource (HR) practices that increase workers’ authority at workplaces and in business
decision making, such as total quality management, self-directed work teams, and
workplace committees—are among the most widely discussed innovations in US
business. Impressed by these programs, the federal government’s Commission on the
Future of Worker-Management Relations recommended in its 1994 report that the
government encourage EI programs to improve the quality of work life and productivity.1
Most analyses of EI focus both on the factors that lead firms to adopt EI policies
and on the impact of EI on outcomes. Adoption of EI is more likely in competitive
product markets, among firms that: respond to the market quickly and flexibly; use new
technologies that require highly skilled workers; have business strategies that emphasize
quality and innovation rather than low cost; and adopt complementary HR practices, such
as high levels of training and incentive compensation plans.2 Studies of the effect of EI
on economic outcomes find that EI promotes higher productivity, improves quality, raises
customer satisfaction and sales,3 and reduces quits and improves worker satisfaction.4,5
But studies also show that EI is not a universal solution to the problems faced by a firm.
Some studies find that EI has modest impacts on outcomes that may not justify the cost of
implementing these programs.6 Other studies emphasize the intermediating effect of

between EI and financial performance.7,8
Although EI programs have been increasing, these policies are not universally
successful, leading some firms to terminate their programs. The failure rate for quality of
work life and quality circles has been high.9 Eaton (1994) estimates a 20 percent failure
rate for employee involvement practices in union establishments, while Kleiner, Leonard,
and Pilarski (2002) provide case evidence of firms abandoning poorly performing EI
programs. Black and Lynch (2004a, 2004b) document that a substantial number of firms
dropped or lowered the percentage of employees participating in job rotation, profit
sharing, or self-managed teams between 1993 and 1996.
This paper uses the results of detailed on-site interviews of managers in 51
manufacturing establishments on the history of their EI and related policies to examine
the decision to adopt and terminate EI programs. We sampled establishments in the
Midwest area, close to the University of Minnesota where the survey team was assembled,
drawing the sample from the US Census Bureau’s Census of Manufacturers. The 51
establishments agreed to participate in the survey and allow researchers to visit the plant
and conduct interviews. From 1995 through 1997, the survey team interviewed managers,
workers, and union representatives at the plants and collected documents about business
environment, technology, and production of the plants. The team visited each plant
several times to verify the facts and learn more about the way the EI programs operated.
The result is a data set with more accurate longitudinal information than could be gained

Addison et al. (2000, 2004) reviewed studies of the impact of the German works council, a
particular kind of EI, on companies’ performance, positing that the effect of works councils is
sensitive to firm size. A significantly positive association between works councils and economic
performance is observed only for large firms, whereas an insignificantly positive or negative one
is found for small plants.

through large-scale surveys conducted via phone or mail. This is critical to our research
design, which focuses on the timing of the introduction and termination of particular EI
programs and policies in the covered establishments.
The survey asked about the plants’ employee involvement policies, recruiting and
selection, training, performance evaluation, and financial participation practices, and
about business strategy and management style. Managers were asked whether the plant
had adopted a certain program since 1986, and if yes, in which year; whether the program
was still in use, and if not, the year the establishment terminated the program. The
employee involvement practices covered were job rotation, suggestion system, quality of
work life, quality circles, total quality management, self-managed work teams, job
redesign, joint labor-management committees, and employee representation on the board
of directors. In addition, the survey asked about selection and staffing policies—whether
the company had a detailed screening process, personal interview, aptitude test, physical
exam, reference check, and probationary period; training—whether the company offered
on-the-job training, training in team building, on-site training, and tuition reimbursement;
performance appraisal policies—whether the company used assessment centers, formal
review sessions, and a standardized form to evaluate their employees periodically; and
financial participation programs—whether the company had an individual incentive plan,
employee stock ownership, cash or deferred profit sharing, gain sharing, skill-based pay,
employee stock purchase plan, and group bonuses.
The survey team also asked managers about business strategies and management
policies. It identified four categories of business strategy: growth of the market share of
the firm, seeking to obtain a market niche, short-term profit maximization, and
maximizing shareholder value of the firm. It asked the manager to rate the

establishment’s emphasis on these strategies on a 1 to 5 scale with 1 indicating “a little”
and 5 being “a great deal.” Managers were also asked whether the plant had undergone
major restructuring since 1986 and, if yes, in which year, how many times; and whether
the firm had changed the plant manager/production leader since 1986, and to rate each
manager’s style on a 1 to 5 scale with 1 representing “close monitoring” and 5
representing “gives employee autonomy.” The basic information on the plants included
the year the plant was built, whether the company had union representation, and the
average yearly turnover rate. Slightly over half of the sample (27 of the 51 establishments)
was unionized.
Trends in EI Use
Table 1 shows the proportion of firms with different numbers of EI programs in
place in each year from 1986, the first year covered by the survey, to 1995. Consistent
with the national increase in EI over the period, the number of EI policies in place
increased from 124 in 1986 to 204 in 1995—a 65 percent change, while the percentage of
establishments with at least one EI program rose from 76.5 percent in 1986 to 96.1
percent in 1995; and the number of companies using two or more programs grew from 55
percent (1986) to 90 percent (1995), while the proportion with just one program fell from
21.6 percent to 3.9 percent.
To see which programs are the most/least frequently adopted, table 2 displays the
number of establishments adopting or terminating a program in a given year and gives the
total number of adoptions and terminations and the number of establishments with a
program in 1995. It shows that in 1995 job rotation was the most frequently used EI
policy, with over 75 percent of plants in the sample adopting it. The second most popular
program is a joint labor-management committee, followed by suggestion system and total
quality management (TQM). Forty-eight percent of companies in the sample had adopted
5

TQM by 1995—just slightly higher than the 42 percent reported by Black and Lynch
(2004a) based on national survey data for 1994. Worker participation on corporate boards
is the least used policy among those in our analysis. At the beginning of the period, only
two companies had adopted the policy of having employees on the boards of the
company. In the 10-year period, one company adopted the program, but another company
abandoned the policy.
Looking at the pattern of change in the introduction and termination of EI
programs by year, table 2 shows relatively large numbers of terminations of programs in
1988 and 1991 when the economy was weak. This suggests greater terminations in
business cycle downturns, possibly due to efforts to cut costs. The most frequently
terminated programs were quality circles and TQM, suggesting that these two programs
may be less effective than other policies.
Investing in EI
What leads firms to adopt or terminate EI?
Viewing the decision regarding EI as an investment designed to raise productivity
or lower costs, firms will invest in EI whenever the expected return from a program
exceeds the fixed (organizational) cost of the initial investment and the variable cost of
operating the EI program. The decision to terminate a program will depend on the
variable cost of operating it and the actual returns (taken as the best indicator of future
returns). This implies an asymmetry in the effect of factors on the likelihood of adoption
and termination of the program. Since the adoption decision depends on fixed as well as
variable costs, it will take a larger return to induce a firm to introduce a program than to
terminate it. This should produce smaller estimated impacts of a factor on decisions to
introduce rather than terminate programs.

6

Our interviews with plant managers, first-line supervisors and production workers,
along with the results of previous research, suggest that the following factors should
influence the decision to introduce an EI program: the extent to which the program
complements other EI programs and HR practices; the firms’ business strategy; and
unionization and other factors such as age of the plant and restructuring that will affect
the transactions cost of introduction or termination.
Complementary Programs
Many analyses of EI indicate that a complementary bundle of practices generates
greater performance than a single program.10 Complementarity implies that more firms
should have a larger number of EI practices than if they selected programs independently.
To test this, we modeled the selection of EI programs on the assumption that each firm
selected policies randomly from an urn that contained the actual distribution of policies in
a given year, and did so without replacement. For example, in 1995 there were 204 EI
policies out of a possible 459 (the 51 firms could have selected 9 EI policies each), so the
hypothetical urn had 204 balls with “EI policy” on it and 255 balls with “no policy.” The
assumption that firms select policies from the urn without replacement yields a
hypergeometric distribution11 as the appropriate null hypothesis to complementarity.
Assuming that each firm reached into an urn and selected either an EI policy or no policy,
the variance of the number of firms with different numbers of programs would be 2.20.12
The actual variance in 1995 was 4.27—twice as great. Alternative statistical models give

12
The mean number of programs is 4; The probability of getting a program from the urn P is
0.466. The variance for the hypergeometric distribution is the variance from the binomial
9(P)(1-P), or 2.24 times the finite correction, (N-n) / (N-1), where N is the total sample size (459)
and n is the number of draws by a firm (9), to obtain the variance of 2.20.

similar results.13 Figure 1 compares the hypergeometric distribution with the actual
distribution of firms by the number of policies they have in 1995. The actual distribution
shows more firms with 0–2 policies than the hypergeometric distribution predicts and
more firms with 8 or 9 policies. This rejects the null hypothesis that the policies are
independent draws and is consistent with the notion that they are complementary.
Looking back at table 1, we note that the proportion of firms with just one
practice falls over time, while the numbers with 2–5 practices grow over time. This
suggests further that firms learn about complementarities over time, so that the
distribution changes in the direction of adopting programs that fit together into a package.
Analyses also suggest that EI is complementary with other advanced HRM
practices. Firms that have extensive training and incentive pay programs are more likely
to adopt EI.14 To see whether this is true in our data, we counted the number of advanced
practices exclusive of EI programs that each firm had in 1995 and compared the number
of EI practices across firms with different numbers of non-EI programs. Appendix table
A gives the cross-tabulation matrix of numbers of HR practices at an establishment and
the number of EI practices at an establishment in 1995. The final column in the table
gives the average number of EI programs for each of six categories of other HR programs.
In the three categories with the most observations, establishments with 14–16 non-EI
HRM practices average 5.6 EI programs, those with 12–14 average 4.5 programs; those
with 10–12 average 3.2. In the three categories with relatively few observations, the
pattern is less clear, as one of the two establishments with just 4–6 other HR programs in
1995 has eight EI programs, giving an average of five for that group. But overall, the

13

For example, we could model the process as a multinomial distribution in which a firm selects
a ball labeled policy or no policy from a set of nine urns. This null would fit not only the total
number of EI policies but also the number within each category. We use the hypergeometric
distribution because it is consistent with our ensuing Markov chain analysis.

correlation coefficient between numbers of other HR programs in 1995 and numbers of
EI programs in 1995 is 0.29, which is statistically significant at the 5 percent level.
Business Strategy
Companies emphasizing service, quality, variety, and employee commitment are
more likely to adopt EI than those focusing on low costs (Arthur, 1992; Osterman, 1994).
Similarly, companies that shift from a low-cost policy to emphasizing service and quality
tend to adopt EI, while those that shift from service and quality to competing on low
costs are more likely to terminate these policies (Youndt et al., 1996).
In our survey, the business strategy of short-term profit maximization is the
closest to the low-cost strategy and should thus reduce the probability that a firm will
adopt an EI program. On the other side, companies that reported that their strategy was
growth of market share could be expected to adopt EI programs to the extent that
employees’ commitment and innovation helps attract potential new customers.
Companies focusing on a niche market have loyal customers and face less cost pressure,
and thus may not need to cut programs to save costs. But they may be less likely to adopt
EI because their emphasis is on task specialization and greater output. Whether
companies that pursue shareholder-value maximization are more or less likely to
terminate EI depends on whether these interests are best served by the programs.
Transactions Cost: Unions, Age of Firm, and Restructuring
Unionization is often associated with low EI use. Since EI programs reduce
workers’ desire for unions (Freeman and Rogers, 1999), firms with such programs are
more likely to remain nonunion than other firms. In unionized establishments, unions
may see EI as a substitute for their function in the organization and may pressure
companies from adopting EI practices. This occurs despite the fact that properly
implemented EI programs can increase the voice of employees and give the union greater
9

say in the day-to-day operation of the firm. Under these conditions, unions may support
EI policies (Eaton, 1994) and reduce the chance that a firm terminates a program.
Two other factors are likely to impact the transactions cost of introducing or
terminating EI programs. New plants have an advantage in adopting EI because they face
less transition costs and resistance from employees than plants that have existed for a
long time (Ichniowski and Shaw, 1995). For older plants, a major restructuring is like
resetting the age clock of the plant. During restructuring, old organizational routine,
structure, and culture undergo dramatic changes. If firms introduce EI at this time, they
deal with the transition cost and resistance all at once (Kleiner, Leonard, and Pilarski,
2002). Moreover, if EI is introduced after a recent restructuring, both organizational
structure and culture change to fit with EI. As a consequence, EI implementation may
encounter less resistance, and the performance effect of EI may be greater.
Plant size, technology, and product market conditions also may affect the
adoption decision. Large firms are more able to afford the costs of implementing EI than
small firms since this is a fixed cost that can be spread over a large number of workers.
However, size may not affect termination because if both large and small firms have
invested in EI, the investment cost is a sunk cost and should not affect the firm’s decision
to end the program. The introduction of new technology and the increased market
competition both drive companies to adopt EI. Many of the interviewed companies cited
increased competition and new technology as the reasons why the companies adopted EI.
The precise definition and descriptive statistics of the explanatory variables are
reported in appendix table B.
Analyzing EI
Many studies measure the intensity of a firm’s EI program with a composite index
of EI calculated by forming a summated rating of specific EI programs (Ichniowski and
10

Shaw, 1995; Pil and MacDuffie, 1996), valuing each program the same. As an alternative
to this procedure, we used the latent variable Rasch model from educational testing to
form an index of employee involvement. In educational testing a Rasch model weighs
more heavily a correct answer on a problem where few students answer than a correct
answer on a problem that many students get right, rather than a simple count of the
correct answers. Analogously, our Rasch index gives greater weight to policies that are
relatively rare in forming an index of the establishment’s intensity of EI.
Formally, the model posits the probability that a plant with a certain program is a
function of plant and EI policy characteristics:

P ( X ij = 1) = Φ (θi , γ j ) , i, establishment, j, EI practice,

(1)

where θ denotes the index of employee involvement in an establishment, and γ
indicates the rarity of the particular EI program. The probability that an establishment had
a certain EI policy depends on an establishment’s degree of EI use ( θ ) and the difficulty
level of an EI program ( γ ). The function Φ is specified to have a logistic form, giving
equation (2):
P ( X ij = 1) =

exp(θi − γ j )
1 − exp(θi − γ j )

, i, establishment, j, EI practice. (2)

We use maximum likelihood estimation to estimate the establishment parameter
( θ ) and the EI policy parameter ( γ ).15 The estimates of θ is our measure of EI use in
plants. Its value ranges from –1 to 1. While conceptually preferable to a simple count of
the number of EI programs that an establishment has, the Rasch measure is highly
correlated with a summated rating count variable (r = 0.98).

15

We use the Quest computer software package to estimate the Rasch measure of EI systems for each
establishment, indicating the difficulty level of each EI practice in each year.

11

Econometric Analysis

Taking the Rasch estimates as the appropriate measure of EI intensity, we first
estimated the determinants of the level of EI use in plants, by pooling observations for all
establishments and years. Column 1 of table 3 records the results of regressing the Rasch
measure of EI on a diverse set of explanatory factors. The estimated coefficient on union
representation is large negative, consistent with the notion that nonunion firms are more
likely to introduce EI programs than union firms. Older and larger plants are also less
likely to have an extensive EI program. On the other hand, companies with other HR
programs, such as training, selection, performance appraisal, and the group-level
incentive pay, had a higher level of EI use than companies without these programs. This
is evidence that EI programs are complementary with these programs. Consistent with its
business strategy, managements that emphasized giving employees autonomy made
greater use of EI programs than managements that emphasized other strategies. Finally,
establishments that recently experienced restructuring had a lower level of EI use,
whereas durable manufacturing establishments made greater use of EI.
Columns 2 and 3 in table 3 turn the extent of EI to the dynamics of adopting or
terminating EI programs in a given year. The dependent variable in column 2 is a 0/1
variable that measures whether or not the firm added at least one EI program between
year t and year t+1. The dependent variable in column 3 is a 0/1 variable that measures
whether or not the firm dropped at least one EI program between year t and year t+1. To
assess how explanatory factors affected these decisions, we estimated the following
equations:
Ait = Xit− 1 β + X ijδ + α i + γ t + ε it,

(3)

Tit = Xit− 1 β + X ijδ + α i+ γ t+ ε it,

12

where Ait is the measure of EI adoption in year t, and Tit measures EI termination in year t;

Xit-1 are a set of time-varying explanatory variables lagged one year; and Xij are timeinvariant variables. Furthermore, αi are individual plant dummy variables, which control
for plant fixed effects, and γ t are year dummy variables.
The two equations are estimated as the linear probability model so that the
coefficients show how much a change in an explanatory variable affects the probability.
We also estimated the adoption and termination decisions using Probit and Logit
specifications and obtained similar marginal effects at the means of explanatory variables
to those given in table 3.16 The first aspect of the estimates in columns 2 and 3 is that
most variables have opposite effects on adoption and termination. The estimated impact
of the existing level of EI is significantly negative in the adoption equation and
significantly positive in the termination equation. This suggests that the establishments
are adjusting their programs, possibly through a Markovian process of the type we
examine next, toward an equilibrium. If this were the case, we would expect other factors
to have comparable opposite signs in the two equations. In fact, this is the case. The two
other significant variables in the adoption equation relate to business strategy:
establishments that emphasize market growth are more likely to adopt EI, while those
seeking niches in the market are less likely to introduce EI programs. In the termination
equation, growth of the market share has a negative sign, while the niche market variable
has a positive but insignificant sign. Unionization also operates in opposite directions
between the two types of changes: it reduces the probability of terminating a program
while increasing the chance of introducing a program. Incentive pay also reduces the

13

chance of terminating a program while having a negligible positive effect on the chances
of introducing an EI program.
The complementarity hypothesis suggests that firms would do better to introduce
or terminate EI programs17 as a group rather than singly, and thus that the number of
adoptions or terminations in a period of time ought to exceed what one might expect from
a binomial model in which the firm has a fixed probability of changing programs and
does so independently of what it is doing with other programs. At the same time, there is
a competing possibility: that management learns slowly about which programs work
together and moves incrementally toward the best combination. In this case, there is
reason to expect fewer or at least no more multiple adoptions or terminations in a given
time period than one might expect from a binomial model. To see which of these factors
dominate the data, we tabulated the distribution of changes in programs in a year and
compared them to the distribution that would result from a binomial distribution in which
the changes occurred randomly among the 51 establishments. If, for example, there were
10 adoptions of EI programs in a period, the probability of having one firm adopt two
programs in the period would be 10/51 × 10/51.
Table 4 shows the actual and expected distributions for changes in adoptions
(panel A) and for changes in terminations (panel B) for all the years and firms in the data
set. The first row in panel A gives the frequency with which firms adopt policies in a year.
Since in most years firms do not change policies, the frequency of a change is relatively
low. The remaining rows in panel A give the frequencies of adoption conditional on the
17

To see whether the EI programs had any effect on the behavior of workers, we regressed
employee turnover rates on EI and the other variables included in table 3. This estimated result
supports studies that found reduced turnover rates as being associated with the use of EI policies
(Batt, 2002; Batt, Colvin, and Keefe, 2002; Bartel, 2004). In addition, we also find that average
turnover rate declines with the age of plant, and it is also lower in durable manufacturing
companies. The turnover rate also decreases as companies use more individual incentive pay and
performance appraisal programs.

14

firm having made a change. The actual distribution shows that a much smaller proportion
of the changes were done with no other policy changing than predicted by the binomial
and that a much larger proportion of changes involved two or more policies changing.
This is the signature of complementarity. The first row of panel B gives the frequency
with which firms terminate policies in a year. The rate of termination is 4.9 percent (25
observations of companies ending EI out of 510 possibilities). The remaining rows of
panel B give the frequencies of termination conditional on the firm having terminated a
program. The actual distribution shows that a much smaller proportion of terminations
were done with no other termination than predicted by the binomial and that a much
larger proportion of changes involved two or more terminations. The data thus support
complementarity in terminations as well as in adoptions.
Markov Analysis

The pattern shown in table 2 in which establishments add new EI programs and
terminate other programs suggests a dynamic adjustment process that potentially moves
establishments toward an equilibrium distribution of numbers of programs. If all the
establishments had identical characteristics, the result would be a single point—say four
EI programs. But establishments differ in various ways, so it makes more sense to think
of the equilibrium as a distribution, with firms that can make better use of EI programs
having more programs and firms to which the programs add less value having few. With
nine different programs, there are a large number of possible combinations (512 = 29),
which is analytically non-tractable. Instead of trying to model the links between specific
programs, we examine next the number of programs that a firm has, using a Markov
chain analysis. We assume that in any period a firm can add or subtract programs and that
the decision to change the number of programs depends solely on the number that the

15

firm had in the previous period. This gives us a Markov chain matrix whose elements are
the probability that a firm moved, say, from three programs to four or two programs, or
five programs or one program. Associated with the matrix is a stationary distribution that
represents the equilibrium state to which the process is headed (Kemeny and Snell, 1976).
Table 5 gives the Markov matrix that we use to analyze the adoption and
termination of EI programs. The elements of the matrix are obtained by averaging all
transitions in the data, regardless of year. Say five firms had three programs in one year
and none changed their number of programs, and five firms had three programs in some
other year and three of the firms increased their programs to four while two firms reduced
them to two, our estimated transition matrix would have a probability of staying with
three programs of 0.5, of increasing to four programs of 0.3, of decreasing to two
programs of 0.2, and zero probability of other transitions. The table groups the eight and
nine programs together both because there are few observations in that part of the
distribution and because, taken by itself, having eight policies is an absorbing state,
which is highly unlikely with additional observations.
The summary statistics in the table give the steady-state or equilibrium
distribution from the Markov analysis and contrast that distribution with the initial
distribution in 1986 and the distribution in 1995. The initial distribution moved rapidly
toward the equilibrium over the period. The sum of the absolute value in the differences
between the distribution in 1986 and the equilibrium distribution was 80 percentage
points.18 By 1995, the sum of the absolute value in the differences between the
distribution and the equilibrium distribution was just 16 percentage points. The model
predicts that the distribution would reach the equilibrium by 2006. Thus, the adoption and

18

This statistic simply subtracts the percentages in the two distributions element by element and
takes the sum of the absolute values. It is the natural metric for comparing two distributions.

16

termination process takes about 20 years to equilibrate, with much of the movement
toward equilibrium occurring within 10 years.
Conclusion

Using 10-year longitudinal data from on-site visits to establishments, we show
that firms’ use of EI has not grown continuously, but rather follows a more complex
pattern, with firms adopting and terminating programs over time, seemingly moving
toward an equilibrium distribution of EI policies. The distribution of firms by their
number of policies indicates complementarity among the policies. Firms are more likely
to adopt EI programs and less likely to terminate them when they have other advanced
human resource practices and a business strategy that includes giving workers autonomy
at the workplace. In addition, firms introduce and terminate EI policies as bundles that
imply that the policies are complementary with each other. We model the dynamics of
adjusting the number of policies over time with a Markov chain and find that the process
moves reasonably rapidly to the steady-state distribution, attaining it in about 20 years.
