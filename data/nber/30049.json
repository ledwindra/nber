    "abstract": "\n\nSeveral small, short-term, or non-experimental studies show that cognitive behavioral informed trainings reduce antisocial behaviors for 1\u20132 years. But there is no large-scale, long-term research on persistence. We follow 999 high-risk men in Liberia 10 years after randomization into: 8 weeks of low-cost therapy, $200 cash, both, or a control group. A decade later, men receiving therapy or therapy with cash were about half as likely as the control group to engage in various antisocial behaviors, including robbery, drug selling, and street fights\u2014far exceeding expert predictions. Impacts are concentrated in the highest-risk men, and most robust from therapy with cash.\n\n",
