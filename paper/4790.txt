AGRICULTURAL INTEREST GROUPS
AND TUE NORTH AMERICAN FREE
TRADE AGREEMENT

ABSTRACT
This paper evaluates the influence of diverse U.S. agricultural interest groups on the North

American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Under NAFTA, licenses and quotas that restricted
agricultural trade between Mexico and the United States were convened to tariffs in January 1994

and all tariffs are to be phased out over adjustment periods of up to 15 years. The agricultural
provisions of the 1988 Canada-U.S. ETA, which left quantitative barriers intact for dairy, poultry
and other sectors, remain in effect for bilateral Canadian-U.S. trade. NAFTA received support

from export-oriented U.S. producers of most grains. ollseeds, livestock, and some horticultural
products. Opposition was expressed by wheat producers, seeking leverage on Canadian exportpricing issues, and protected sugar, peanut, and winter fruit and vegetable producers. The
opposition was not addressed in the side agreements negotiated by the Clinton administration but

the agricultural commodity groups were able to bargain for accommodations in the subsequent
legislative debate. Final concessions protect U.S. sugar from Mexican competition, provide some

transition protection to winter fruits and vegetables, and ensnarl the United States in disputes
about Canadian exports of wheat and peanut butter. With these concessions. NAFTA results in
essentially no reform of entrenched domestic agricultural support programs in the United States
(or Canada) during the lengthy tariff phase-out periods.

AGRICULTURAL INTEREST GROUPS
AND THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT

During 1993 a shrill public debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) took place in the United States. The idea of bilateral free trade agreements (ETAs)
with Israel, Canada and Mexico had initially been considered by the Reagan administration in the
early 1980s. The dual intent of the proposed agreements was to lower barriers to trade with these

important partner countries and to build pressure for multilateral reforms under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GA1'T). After an initial delay, the Israel-U.S. and Canada-U.S.
agreements developed relatively quickly and implementing legislation for these agreements was

approved by Congress in May 1985 and September 1988, respectively (see table 1 for a
chronology of events).

Mexico proposed developing a similar trade agreement with the United States in May

1990. The ensuing negotiations were expanded to include Canada in 1991 and a trilateral
agreement was reached in August 1992. It was signed by the three heads of state in December,

just prior to President Bush leaving office.
With the change in administration, newly elected President Clinton sought supplementary
(side) agreements to clarify and strengthen provisions of NAFTA with respect to the environment,
labor and import surges. Negotiations for these side agreements were completed in August 1993.

The Clinton administration then launched an intense campaign for passage of the NAFTA
implementing legislation. After heated debate, it won a crucial and surprisingly large come-frombehind victory with a majority of Republican support when the House of Representatives approved

the bill on November 17 by a 234 to 200 vote. This decision set the stage for concluding efforts

on the Uruguay Round GAfl negotiations in December 1993, and NAFTA took effect on
January 1, 1994.

This paper focuses on the attempts of U.S. agricultural interest groups to influence both
the negotiations for NAFTA and the congressional debate over its implementing legislation. The

objectives of the analysis are to investigate the interests, goals and strategies of the different
groups and to evaluate the success of their efforts either to have NAFTA create expanded export

opportunities or to limit the scope of the agreement in order to retain existing protection.
Agricultural issues have loomed large in world multilateral trade discussions since the inception

of the Uruguay Round GAiT negotiations in 1986, and Canada and Mexico are important
agricultural trade partners of the United States; they account jointly for more than one-fourth of

U.S. agricultural imports and one-sixth of U.S. agricultural exports. For these reasons, the
agricultural provisions of NAFTA became an important component of the agreement. Moreover,

agricultural interests ultimately played a crucial role in the coalition that supported the NAFTA
implementing legislation.

More specifically, the agricultural commodity groups became aligned as supporters of
trade liberalization under NAFTA or as proponents of limits on the scope of the agreement based

on their particular interests in trade with Mexico and Canada and their perceptions of NAFTA's

broader implications. Early in the negotiations, the various groups confronted a high-level
decision by Mexico and the IJnited States to include all agricultural products under provisions for

long-run liberalization. The U.S. agricultural groups supporting trade liberalization had some
influence on this decision but it was more widely attributed to willingness of Mexico to remove

trade barriers from its politically sensitive and historically highly-protected corn sector. This
decision left little room for exclusion of other commodities.

3

Under the negotiated agreement announced in August 1992, alt licenses and quotas
restricting Mexican-U.S. agricultural tradewere to be converted to tariffs in January 1994. These

and other tariffs were also to be completely phased out over adjustment periods of up to 15 years.
Canada had resisted such full coverage of the agricultural provisions of NAFTA and the U.S.

agricultural groups and others favoring liberalized trade had not been able to extract Canadian
concessions. Instead, it had been agreed that the less comprehensive Canada-U.S. FTA. which

left nontariff barriers intact for dairy, poultry and other sectors, would remain in effect for
bilateral Canadian-U.S. trade. Mexico and Canada had negotiated a similar agreement.

Because NAFTA promised to liberalize U.S. agricultural trade with Mexico, the
agreement as negotiated received support in the United States from market-oriented generalmembership farm organizations and from the export-oriented producers of most grains, oilseeds,

livestock, and some horticultural products. The dairy and cotton sectors, although protected by
U.S. import quotas, joined the NAFTA supporters when it became apparent that Mexico had little

capacity to produce competitive imports and strong rules of origin were adopted.

The NAFFA negotiations and the August 1992 initial agreement were opposed by farm

groups favoring restrictive supply controls to raise domestic prices, wheat producers seeking
leverage on Canadian export subsidy issues, and protected sugar, peanut, and citrus and other

winter fruit and vegetable producers objecting to specific transition-period provisions. The
presidential election in November 1992 appeared to open renewed opportunities for influence by
these groups but the side agreements negotiated by the new Clinton administration were limited

in scope. Dissatisfied with these results, the producer groups opposed to various NAFTA
provisions sought further accommodations in the subsequent legislative debate. Willingness to

4

withdraw their opposition in exchange for specific concessions gave them substantial bargaining

power relative to organized labor and others committed to the defeat of the NAFTA implementing
legislation.

As the heavily contested congressional vote approached in November 1993, concessions
made to agricultural interests protected U.S. sugar from Mexican competition, provided some

transition-period protection to winter fruits and vegetables, and ensnared the United States in

disputes about Canadian exports of wheat and peanut butter. Thus, critical support for the
implementing legislation from agricultural interest groups (or at least the withdrawal of their
active opposition) came at the expense of some weakening of the original agreement and other
related costs. White the long-run provisions of the agreement for agricultural trade liberalization
remained intact, with the final concessions NAFTA results in essentially no reform of entrenched

domestic agricultural support programs during the lengthy tariff phase-out periods. The U.S.
agricultural producers obtain increased market opportunities in Mexico, while deflecting most
prospective import competition.

To develop these themes, this paper is organized as follows. The next section provides
a brief description of U.S. agricultural production, trade and price-support policies as a basis for
evaluating the stakes of various interest groups in NAPTA. The following section examines the

initial positions of the agricultural interest groups and their strategies for influencing the
negotiations. Next, the provisions of the negotiated agreement are summarized and public and

private-sector assessments of these provisions are reviewed. The focus then turns to the side
agreements negotiated by the Clinton administration, the activities of the various agricultural
interest groups during the congressional debate over the implementing legislation, and the final

5

concessions and guarantees offered to obtain support for the legislation from agricultural

interests.

The concluding section addresses some issues raised by the NAFTA outcomes for agriculture.

Diversity within Agriculture
From an aggregate perspective, agriculture represents less than 3 percent of national
output. Even so. agricultural production is diffused among many diverse sectors. Descriptive
statistics about production, aggregate trade, and bilateral trade with Canada and Mexico at the
outset of the NAFTA negotiations (1989-1991 averages) are presented for the major groups of
commodities in table 2.
Grains and oilseeds accounted for one-fifth of the value of U.S. production of agricultural

commodities and their direct products during 1989-1991. Grains and oilseeds are generally

exported crops, with one-fourth of the value of production sold in world markets and the
percentage as high as 60 to 75 percent for wheat and rice. Imports of grains and oilseeds are
minimal but imports from Canada comprised over one-third of their value, and essentially all of
the value of imported wheat, barley and soybeans.

Livestock and poultry products accounted for another one-fifth of the value of domestic

agricultural production during 1989-1991. The U.S. has maintained some quantitative meat
import restrictions and trade has been less important for livestock and poultry products than for

grains and oilseeds. The value of imports and the value of exports of livestock and poultry
products were less than 5 percent, respectively, of the value of domestic production. Of this
trade, Canada produced over 35 percent of U.S. import-value and Mexico another 10 percent.
Canada and Mexico each accounted for over 15 percent of the value of U.S. exports.

A third group of commodities important in the context of NAFTA are those for which the

U.S. has traditionally imposed import quotas under Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act
of 1935 and its extensions. The Section 22 legislation authorizes trade restrictions when imports

'render ineffective or materially interfere with" domestic supply-control and price-support
programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Dairy products, cotton and peanuts
are among the commodities for which there are Section 22 quotas. Imports of these commodities

have been restricted to less than 2 percent of domestic production. Exports of dairy products
were also less than 2 percent of domestic production at the beginning of the NAFFA negotiations

but exports accounted for more than 40 percent of U.S. cotton and 15 percent of the value of
peanut production. Mexico received over one-third of the U.S. dairy exports and provided one-

sixth of the U.S. cotton imports. Canada provided almost one-third of the U.S. imports of
peanuts and peanut products.

Historically, Section 22 quotas on imports of sugar and sugar-containing products have

also been used to protect U.S. producers and give preferential treatment to selected foreign
suppliers. Domestic production of cane and beet sugar has increased since 1980 under the most
recent trade restrictions. High domestic sugar prices have also contributed to use of high-fructose

corn sweeteners increasing from less than one-fourth of total caloric sweetener consumption in
1979-1981 to almost one-half in 1989-1991.

The U.S. sugar import quotas were challenged by Australia in 1989 under GAY!' rules
because domestic supply controls were not in effect at that time.' To settle the GAY!' dispute,
the import quotas were replaced by a two-tier tariff regime. Under the two-tier tariffs, a limited

Domestic production quotas were assigned in 1993 for the first time since Cuban sugar
imports were proscribed after Fidel Castro took power in 1959.

8

quantity of imports, known as a tariff-rate quota (TRQ), enters under a low rate ($0.01/tb).
Potential additional imports carry an over-quota tariff of more than 80 percent ($0.18/Ib).

While the two-tier sugar tariff regime in principle aliows access to the U.S. market in
response to world market conditions, the over-quota tariffs are prohibitive and the TRQ and two-

tier tariffs have had trade-restrictive effects similar to the previous quota system. To protect
domestic producers, sugar imports have been reduced from over 3 million metric tons (MMT)
in 1980 to less than 2 MMT—just under 15 percent of domestic production--during 1989-1991.

Mexico provided only a small fraction of U.S. imports of sugar and sugar-containing products.
Canada provided over one-fourth of the imported sugar-containing products.

A final group of agricultural commodities is comprised of horticultural products. The bulk

of domestic production is of vegetables for which imports or exports accounts for less than 10
percent of production value. Trade is more important for seasonal winter vegetables. For these

commodities, imports were over 40 percent and exports were almost 10 percent of the value of
domestic production during 1989-1991. Over 90 percent of the imports came from Mexico and
over 90 percent of the exports went to Canada. Trade is also relatively important for citrus and

other winter fruits. Citrus imports are primarily frozen concentrated orange juice from Brazil
competing with production in Florida. Citrus exports are mostly fresh products from California,
with Canada an important export market. California fruit and vegetable producers and processors

have also integrated their operations into Mexico to a greater extent than their Florida
counterparts. Thus, the horticultural sector is characterized by divergent commodity, seasonal
and regional interests.

9

Farm Numbers
Some characteristics of the different production sectors are summari,.ed in table 3 on the

basis of the 1987 Census of Agriculture. Grains and oilsccds were produced on over 400,000
farms and heel cattle on over 625,000 farms and ranches. There were over 130,000 dairy farms

and just over 100.0(X) farms produced sugar or field crops oilier than grains and oilseeds Less

than 100,000 farms fattened cattle on feedlots, raised hogs, or produced fruits and tree nuts,
respectively, while less than 50,000 farms produced poultry and eggs, cotton, or vegetables and
melons.
Of the units counted as farms, almost three-fourths had gross sales of under $50,000 and

provided less than full-time employment for a farm operator. This type of farm produced less
than 10 percent of the total value of output except in the cases of grains and oilseeds, beef cattle
(excluding feedlots) and sugar and other field crops. In contrast, less than 2 percent of all farms

had sales of $500,000 and above. The farms in this sales class produced from 40 to 90 percent

of the beef cattle on feedlots, poultry and eggs, sugar and other field crops, vegetables and
melons, and fruits and tree nuts.

Levels of Support and Protection
There are differences among the sectors in terms of the level of support provided through

domestic farm programs and the protection provided by trade policies. Producer subsidy
equivalents (PSEs), shown in columns one and two of table 4, estimate the percentage of farm

income derived from a wide range of policy interventions, including price policies, direct
payments, trade harriers, and insurance, credit, tax, and other input and prtessing subsidies.

Annual PSEs have I)eeti calculated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and

a basis for comparing agricultural policies among countries during negotiations of the GATF
Uruguay Round, the Canada-U.S. FTA and NAFTA.

The levels of protection provided to various commodities by tariffs and other border
policies are also reported in table 4. The tariff rates in effect at the beginning of the NAFTA
negotiations are shown in the third column. Estimates of the differences between domestic and

world prices induced by tariffs and quantitative border restrictions are shown in the fourth

column. The United States and other GATI member countries agreed to convert their
quantitative barriers to tariffs at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiationsin December

1993. Under this agreement, tariff rates similar to the differences given in table 4 are to apply
to U.S. imports above negotiated tariff-rate-quotas (as in the case of the sugar over-quota tariffs).

The PSEs and protection measures in table 4 show that U.S. policy interventions provide

high levels of support for some export crops as well as for sugar and thecommodities protected
by import quotas. Support for export crops is provided primarily through acreage-reduction-based
supply restrictions, direct payments to producers that supplement market returns, and floor prices

('loan rates") at which farmers can place their output in storage and receive a loan from the
government. Wheat producers also benefit particularly from export subsidies. The PSEs have
been higher for wheat, barley and rice than for corn, oats, sorghum, and soybeans. Tariff levels

are relatively low for all of the grains, reflecting the policies of domestic market prices near
world levels and support through direct payments.

For the import-quota and TRQ protected commodities dairy, peanuts and sugar, large
distortions favoring domestic producers have been created by the import restrictions, as shown

13

by the estimated tariff equivalents of these barriers. Cotton producers, while protected by Section

22 quotas, also receive direct payments and U.S. prices are near world levels.2

In contrast to the Section 22 commodities and sugar, fmits and vegetables have not been
subject to import quotas and producers have received few direct support payments (PSEs are not

available for fruits and vegetables). In general, producers of [nuts and vegetables receive
relatively low levels of protection from tariffs but there are a few exceptions. The support and

protection levels have also been relatively low for livestock and poultry. The estimated tariff
equivalent for beef (31.1 percent) suggests that meat import restrictions have had more effect than

indicated by the estimated PSEs but have been less severe than for the Section 22 commodities
and sugar.

The policy interventions in U.S. agriculture and the levels of support and protection
provided to different commodities are the cumulative result of convoluted economic and political

forces. Gardner (1987), for example, acknowledged that "Mori accident" had played a role
in determining protection levels. He also found that support (measured by the producer price

gains resulting from farm programs similar to the PSEs) increased systematically across
commodities when elasticities of supply and demand were low, a larger share of output was
imported or exported, and the lagged level of total farm income declined relative to nonfarm
income. Given these determinants of support, factors that facilitated political organization by a
sector also were significant. There was a nonlinear relationship between the number of producers

of a commodity and the level of support obtained, with less support of commodities for which

at lower world price levels of U.S. peanuts beyond a quantity produced for the domestic market. Dairy
products are priced above world levels and are exported with subsidies.
14

there were either fewer or greater numbers of producers. Support was also found to rise with

the size of the average unit and the geographic concentration of production and stability of its
location over time.
Observations based on tables 2-4 corroborate several of Gardner's hypotheses and suggest

a few others (see also Swinnen and van der Zee (1993) and the references therein). Most
commodities produced domestically are protected from import competition. Among the exported

commodities, wheat producers are particularly effective in obtaining support. This is consistent

with the lack of alternative production opportunities (inelastic supply) in the dryer parts of the
midwestern grain belt where wheat is produced. Grains generally receive more support than
oilseeds even though they are often grown on the same farms. This is due partly to the origins
of the support programs in the depression-era policies of the New Deal when soybeans were not

grown on a commercial basis. One might also hypothesize that levels of support among the
grains are positively correlated with the degree of export dependence, although the directionof
causality remains open to question.

Among the factors affecting the relative demands for support and protection, the levels of
intervention are higher for the moderate number of fanns producing grains or dairy than for either

the large number of farms producing beef cattle or the relatively small number producing cattle
on feedlots, poultry and eggs, cotton, or vegetables and melons, as shown by tables 3 and 4. The

extent of processing associated with the products from a sector also mightbe hypothesized to be

related to the levels of support and protection. But dairy, sugar and peanuts obtain high levels

of protection and soybeans and beef cattle relatively low levels of support even though the
products from each of these sectors requires substantial processing.

Interest Group Approaches to the Negotiations
Agricultural interests are represented both by broad general-membership organizations and

directly by numerous commodity-based associations. The approaches of these various groups to

the NAFFA negotiations were affected by specific aspects of bilateral trade with Mexico and
Canada and the levels of support received by producers.
In particular, trade with Mexico had been affected by high levels of protection agriculture

received there in the mid-1980s, with PSEs averaging 47.6 percent over 14 major commodities

(USDA. 1994). Under reforms initiated by the administration of Mexico's President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, the avenge PSE declined to 19.9 percent by 1990. Concurrently, the value
of U.S. exports increased from $1.2 billion to $2.5 billion.
When the Mexico-U.S. free trade negotiations were jointly announced, President Salinas

and President Bush articulated a broad mandate for reducing bilateral trade barriers and
supporting Mexican reforms in agriculture and other sectors. However, the high levels of
protection traditionally provided to many commodities in both Mexico and the United States
created considerable uncertainty about whether all agricultural sectors would be included under
the mandate for trade liberalization.

The uncertainty about NAFTA's agricultural provisions increased when Canada joined
Mexico and the United States in seeking a trilateral agreement. Nontariff trade barriers had not

been addressed in the previous Canada-U.S. FTA

(see,

for example, Miner (1993)). Import

restrictions were retained by Canada to protect its dairy and poultry sectors, which benefitted in

1991 from PSEs of 67.0 and 35.0 percent, respectively, and by the United States for dairy,
cotton, peanuts, and sugar. Although both the Canadian and the U.S. wheat producers claimed

16

they wanted to clarify what constituted unfairdomestic and export subsidies, finding a mutually

acceptable definition remained elusive for these highly subsidized and export-dependent
competitors. Canada retained import licensing authority for grains unless U.S. PSEs fell below
Canadian levels and little progress was made on mutual commitments to develop rules governing

subsidies. Both countries retained the right to reintroduce either quotas or tariffs on grains if

"imports increase significantly as a result of a substantial change in either Party's support
programs."
There was also uncertainty with respect to NAFTA's agricultural provisions because the
negotiations took place against the backdrop of as-yet-undetermined outcomes of the multilateral

GAIT negotiations that had begun in 1986. The United States had originally proposed a
comprehensive "zero option" in GAITcalling for the elimination of essentially all trade-distorting
border measures and domestic support payments on a multilateral basis. The zero-option proposal

had proven untenable by the mid-term GAIT review in 1988. By the beginning of the NAFTA

negotiations, the GAIT discussions were focused on more restricted provisions for capping
domestic support levels, partial reduction of export subsidies, and tariffication of import quotas
and licenses with their replacement by two-tier tariffs and minimum market access provided by
TRQs.

Faced with all this uncertainty about likely outcomes, the various agricultural interest

groups took active roles in seeking to shape the NAFA negotiations. They became aligned
along two broad positions: Those favoring their inclusion under provisions for agricultural trade
liberalization and those favoring limits on the scope of the agreement with retention of some

17

of

the traditional trade restrictions. The basic positions of a selected subset of the most active
agricultural and agri-processing industry groups are shown in table 5.

Proponents of Liberalization
The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) is the largest of the general-membership

organizations and is oriented toward competitive markets. At the outset of the NAFTA
negotiations, the AFBF commissioned a study of the potential impacts on domestic agriculture of

reduced trade barriers with Mexico. This study showed generally positive effects and provided
the basis for the AFOF's approach to the negotiations. Although the study was criticized by some

farm groups for minimizing the potential impacts on sectors that might face increascd import
competition, the AFBF concluded it would support comprehensive liberalization that included
even the most politically sensitive import-competing commodities. The AFBF sought an active

role in the negotiations, based partly on a view that it had not been vocal enough during
negotiations for the Canada-U.S. FTA.

Many of the grain and oilseed commodity associations joined the AFBF in support for
eliminating trade barriers under NAFTA. For these commodities, the 1987-1990 export trend
was interpreted to imply that reduced protection and increased income growth in Mexico would
provide market opportunities. In particular, increased exports of U.S. corn and other feed grains
were expected if Mexico further reduced its traditional support programs and trade restrictions.
The National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), the largcst organization of corn producers and

processors (with about 25,000 members), became an active supporter of NAF'TA. The NCGA

sought maximum opening of the Mexican market. It requested an initial TRQ for corn of 3.5
MMT, which was considered a level 'tough for Mexico to grant." The NCGA expccted further

gains in derived demand for corn from a growing Mexican market for U.S. livestock products.
Livestock producers concurred in anticipating gains from liberalized trade with Mexico.
The approach toward the negotiations of the National Cattlemen's Association (NCA) was

representative of their efforts. The NCA was interested in expanding foreign market access and
cited as a successftil precedent the 1988 bilateral agreement to replace Japanese beef quotas with

TRQs and declining tariff levels. Mexico did not have import quotas on beef when the NAFTA
negotiations were initiated but there was uncertainty about continued openness of the border and

the levels at which tariffs on livestock products would be set.

The corn growers and cattlemen, among others, were actively engaged in the NAFFA
negotiations. The NCGA had extensive discussions of goals and strategy in meetings of their
voting delegates, stayed in close contact with the senior negotiators, and kept their supporters in

Congress informed about the process. The NCGA was represented on the Grains and Feed
Technical Advisory Committee of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), one of ten
Agricultural Technical Advisory Committees (ATACs) established as part of USTR's privatesector advisory structure by the Trade Act of 1974. The NCA worked closely with the broader

Meat Industry Trade Policy Council and was represented on USTR's Livestock and Livestock

Products Technical Advisory Committee, its multi-commodity Agricultural Policy Advisory
Committee (APAC), and its president's Advisory Committee on Trade Policy and Negotiations.
The presidentially-appointed private-sector advisory system is arranged in three tiers: the
president's Advisory Committee on Trade Policy and Negotiations (ACTPN); seven policy
advisory committees (Services, Investment, and Intergovernmental, managed solely by USTR, and
Industry, Agriculture, Labor, and Defense, managed jointly with other agencies); and more than

30 technical, sectoral and functional advisory committees. The ten Agricultural Technical
Advisory Committees (ATACs) address cotton, dairy products. fruits and vegetables, grains and
feed, livestock and livestock products, oilseed and products, poultry and eggs, processed foods,
sweeteners, and tobacco.
20

Representatives of the NCA concluded that they had ample opportunities to influence the outcome

of the negotiations through regular interaction with USDA and USTR and through Congress.
Support for an agreement to liberalize agriculwral trade also came from representatives

of many processing and supply industries. Typical of the industry organizations was the
Sweetener Users Association (SUA), sponsored by 16 major food processors. While recognizing

that the sweetener users had little influence on the agricultural committees of Congress, an SUA

representative and two other user-industry representatives served on USTR's Sweeteners
Technical Advisory Committee. They sought to have sugar and sugar-containing products
included in the provisions for trade liberalization. Other processing industries were represented
on commodity-specific technical advisory committees (e.g., ollseeds, dairy and cotton) and on the

separate Processed Foods Technical Advisory Committee.

Representatives of the dairy industry were also marginally among the supporters of
eliminating trade bathers. Although protected by import quotas, the dairy industry had initiated

a broad lobbying effort to obtain the authority for increased export subsidies. The industry
viewed this as a means to reduce domestic supply and obtain higher domestic prices by exploiting

an inelastic domestic demand (Barr, 1993). Since Mexico produced few import-competing dairy

products and accounted for a large fraction of U.S. dairy exports, as shown in table 2. greater
market access under NAFTA was consistent with the industry's overall initiative. The industry
also believed that it could be competitive in Canada if dairy trade restrictions were eliminated.

Throughout the NAFTA negotiations, a coalition of dairy cooperatives, represented by the

National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF), remained noncommittal but not opposed to
NAFTA. While supporting expanded export opportunities, the NMPF argued against tariffication

21

of U.S. Section 22 dairy quotas, especially if Canada maintained its import barriers. The NMPF
was represented on the Dairy Technical Advisory Committee and worked closely with USDA and

USTR at the staff and policy levels to develop strong rules of origin in the event U.S. quotas for
Mexico were eliminated on a bilateral basis. Representatives of NMPF also "wrote the obligatory

letters" and participated in congressional hearings. Otherwise, they spent "almost no time on the

Hill" because they felt the congressional agricultural committees were less interested in dairy
issues than issues concerning peanuts and sugar.

Prononents of Limits on the Agreement
Among the groups that were opposed to the NAFTA negotiations or sought limits on the

scope of any agreement, the National Farmers Union (NFU), a general organization with
membership concentrated in the upper mid-western states, and several other small generalmembership organizations had long argued for policies to raise prices for farm products through

restrictive supply management. Because of NFU's support of supply management rather than
export-based market expansion, its representatives viewed themselves as "not being allowed at
the table" and, likewise, as not having been interested in negotiating details of a trade agreement.

The NFU, which claims to represent the traditional family farmer against agribusiness interests,

sought intensive congressional involvement arguing that the Congress would "give the left out
entities a chance to have their say."
The NFU view of the negotiations was shared by the American Corn Growers Association

(ACGA). The ACGA, with 10,000 members, also seeks higher domestic corn prices through
restrictive supply management. It traced its origins to a split with the National Corn Growers
Association over endorsing lower corn loan rates in 1985 as a means to increase international

22

competitiveness.4 The ACGA opposed NAFFA and was not interested in participating in the
negotiations for specific provisions.

Wheat producers also took a contentious approach toward NAFTA. Although the wheat
sector is dependent on exports, the producers raised concerns that their competitiveness was being

affected by nontransparency of the pricing policies of the Canadian Wheat Board, which is the
exclusive agent for Canadian wheat exports, and by eastbound grain transportation subsidies in
Canada. These policies were among the issues left unresolved under the Canada-U.S. FTA. The

U.S. producers argued that increased Canadian exports of wheat into the United States and
Mexico after 1988 (capturing of a large share of the Mexican wheat market) were the result of
Canadian export subsidies. The Canadian producers counter-argued that their export shipments
resulted from the price differentials and U.S. shipment patterns resulting from the United States'
own wheat export enhancement (subsidy) program.

To pursue its case1 the National Association of Wheat Growers (NAWG) sought either
elimination of Canadian subsidies or quantitative limits on Canadian imports, such as the United

States had imposed under Section 22 before world wheat prices and U.S. exports rose sharply in

1974. The wheat producers, unlike the NFU and ACGA. were actively involved in the NAFTA

negotiating process. The NAWG kept its members "highly informed" of its objectives,
participated in hearings of the agricultural committees of Congress, worked through contacts at

USDA and USTR, and brought what its representatives termed "collaborative input from

With the high value of the U.S. dollar in the mid-1980s, world corn prices were resting on
the U.S. loan rate and U.S. exports had declined markedly. Lowering the loan rate under these
circumstances lowered domestic market prices, to which the ACGA objected, but also reduced the
quantities going into storage and increased exports.
23

Congress" to bear on the negotiators. A NAWG representative served on USTR's Grains and
Feed Technical Advisory Committee but viewed the committee as having little influence.

Limits on the access to U.S. markets provided by NAFTA were also sought by
representatives of the commodities protected historically by import quotas. These sectors shared

two concerns at the outset of the negotiations: that elimination of the trade restrictions with
Mexico would create potential competition from Mexican producers, and that it would set a
precedent for further weakening of protective quota restrictions either in subsequent negotiations

or by subjecting the remaining restrictions to legal challenge (Gillon).
With their mutual concerns, one might expect a strong coalition to have developed among

the sectors protected by import quotas. However, the views of the dairy industry were tempered
by its recognition of the limited competition and potential export opportunities that NAFTA might
create, as described above. Cotton producers and processors, represented by the National Cotton

Council of America (NCCA), also tempered their position. They recognized that expanded export

opportunities might arise if a North American free trade area for textiles and apparel was

associated with strong rules of origin for the fiber content of the final products—industry
perceptions that mirrored the argument made against the trade diversionary effects of such rules

of origin by Krueger (1993).
The moderated views of the dairy and cotton producers (assuming there were strong rules

of origin) left producers of peanuts and sugar as the most strident proponents of limits on

NAFFA's market access provisions. Although Mexico was a net peanut importer, the U.S.
producers expressed intense opposition to possible import competition, partly on the basis of
ostensible concern about illegal transshipments through Mexico of non-NAFTA peanuts from the

24

Caribbean and elsewhere if quotas were removed on a bilateral basis. The peanut producers,
USTR's Oilseed and
represented primarily by nine state organizations, pressed their case through

Products Technical Advisory Committee and through Congress. The producers argued that their

concerns were exacerbated because consideration of NAFTA came after several years of what
they tenned "extreme uncertainty" about a GAIT agreement that could affect the peanut support
program by increasing foreign access to their domestic market.

The sugar sector's similar view of liberalized trade under NAFTA as a threat came in
response to an initial Mexican request for access to the U.S. market with a sugar TRQ of 1.5
MMT—more than the combined TRQs of all other countries. The U.S. producers claimed they
had initially been assured by the Bush administration that the traditional pattern of trade--with
Mexico a net importer of sugar—would not be disrupted by NAFTA. In this context, they viewed
the Mexican access request as a "shot out of the barrel. U This volume of exports was considered

possible if Mexican production and refining were modernized and if a shift in relative prices
between corn and sugar led to use of corn sweeteners in the Mexican soft drink industry.
The sugar producers took a strong stand in defence of their protected domestic market

during the NAFTA negotiations. They opposed any trade liberalization thatwould put pressure

on the U.S. sugar support program. Illustrative of their potent avenues of influence was
appointment to USTR's Agricultural Policy Advisory Committee of the executive vice-president
of the Florida Sugar Cane League, representing one of the major sugar-producing states, after
extensive pressure on the Bush administration by members of Congress.

Representatives of some commodities in the horticultural sector also expressed strong
reservations about trade liberalization with Mexico. The USTR's Fruits and VegetablesTechnical

25

Advisory Committee became a forum for discussing the positions of the diverse interest groups
within this sector. An early statement in September 1990 cited concerns about increased import

competition and called for adequate transition

periods for tariff reductions. It noted that price-

based tariff snaphacks to protect Canadian farmers against import surges that depressed domestic
prices had been included in the Canada-U:S. FTA, and called for similar provisions in NAFTA

to protect U.S. farmers. Florida vegetable producers also sought exemptions from the agreement
until disparities in environmental and labor conditions were eliminated, a stance not supported by

the producers and processors in California.

Florida citrus producers, represented on USTR's Processed Foods Technical Advisory
Committee, were one of the most active groups to oppose NAFTA, arguing they would be "one

of the losers" from an agreement with Mexico. The Florida citrus producers initially proposed

that orange juice be excluded from the agreement for 20 years. Their proposal would have
maintained existing protection for the productive life of the extensive new plantings that took
place in southern Florida after severe freezes in the 19805.

With the import-competing Florida producers of winter vegetables and citrus and other
winter fruits joining the sugar sector in opposition to NAFTA, a strong coalition emerged to press

the case of florida agriculture. The fruit and vegetable, citrus and sugar interests developed a

unified position with other agricultural groups. The Florida Farm Bureau and the Florida
Cattlemen's Association joined the coalition, and both eventually broke ranks with their national

organizations' support for NAFFA. The state Commissioner of Agriculture became an active

proponent of the Florida concerns and the producers received endorsements from the state

26

legislature and elsewhere. Together, the agriculwral groups exerted a powerful influence on
Florida's large congressional delegation, whose cooperation they judged to be "superb."

Measuring the Activity Levels

Both proponents of liberalization of agricultural trade and proponents of limits on the
scope of the agreement were actively engaged in asserting their positions during the NAFTA
negotiations. Avenues for influence ranged from individual contacts with USDA and USTR at

the staff and policy levels, to participation in USTR's ten Agricultural Technical Advisory
Committees and its Agricultural Policy Advisory Committee, to intervention by members of the

agricultural committees of Congress or other individual members, to direct interactions with the
president. Specific groups were often engaged in the process through a variety of channels but

a reasonable generalization is that groups that found the broad outline of the negotiations
amenable to their interests were able to work closely with• the negotiators and their technical
staffs, while groups opposed to the general direction of the negotiations sought redress through
Congress.

One quantitative indicator of the levels of interest in NAFTA among the various
agricultural sectors comes from the information about the agreement provided by publications

aimed at their different constituents. A summary of articles about NAFFA in 30 general and
commodity-specific agricultural magazines is presented in table 6. The sample period covers the

original negotiations, the change in administration after the 1992 elections, and the initial
discussions of the side agreements negotiated by the Clinton administration.
Using the average number of articles about NAFFA per issue of a magazine as a measure

of intensity of attention, the highest average was found for the magazines in the sugar sector

(1.08), followed by grains and oilseeds (0.80) and horticulture (0.48). General farm magazines
and the magazines in the dairy and peanut sectors show somewhat lower averages (<0.30) and

the lowest average (0.11) was found for livestock and poultry publications.
Based on a qualitative content assessment, the articles were also classified as being either

reports of news or presentations of analysis or opinion. The latter articles were divided among
those that presented factual material without either explicit support or opposition to the agreement,

those that were supportive of the agreement, and those in which opposition was expressed.
Magazines in the sugar sector not only showed the highest intensity level but the articles were

primarily expressions of opposition.

Articles in the grains and oilseeds and horticulwre

magazines were split more evenly among news reports, analysis and differing opinions. Largely

factual coverage of NAFTA was presented in the general farm magazines, while articles in the
small sample of dairy and peanut magazines were evenly divided between news and analysis or
opinion, with a generally supportive position in the dairy magazines and opposition in the peanut
magazines.

A second quantitative measure of the involvement of the various interest groups in the
NAPTA negotiations is provided by their testimony before congressional committees. There were

13 hearings at which agricultural groups were represented during the negotiations for the initial
agreement and the subsequent side agreements (three each by committees or subcommittees on

agriculture, energy and commerce, and ways and means, and one each by foreign affairs, public

works, small business, and education and labor).
Testimony at the various hearings reflected the diverse views of the general-membership

and commodity-specific agricultural groups. Of 20 appearances by general-membership

•

29

organizations, the American Farm Bureau Federation and National Farmers Union were
represented three times each, with remaining testimonies from a variety of other groups.
Supporters of trade liberalization from the grains and oilseeds sector testified 12 times, the
National Association of Wheat Growers had three opportunities to raise its concerns about

Canadian policies, and the American Corn Growers Association testified once against the
agreement. Livestock and poultry producers testified four times in support of the agreement.
Dairy and cotton groups were also represented four times each, and peanut interests testified two

times. Sugar producers testified eight times, while the industrial sweetener users testified only

once. The horticultural sector was represented in 44 testimonies. The Florida coalition was
represented six times by vegetable groups, four times by the state Commissioner of Agriculture,

and twice by the citrus association. California and other western and Mexican horticultural
groups were represented 26 times in the hearings.

A third basis for assessing the levels of activity among the various agricultural interest
groups comes from informal observations of the negotiators and commodity group representatives.

One key negotiator indicated that despite the efforts of the American Farm Bureau Federation and

other supporters, there was not a forceful lobby for comprehensive trade liberalization during the
negotiations. Negotiators on both sides frequently cited keeping defensive domestic interests "on

board" as their most difficult task, and many participants in the process acknowledged that
established interests that feared losses were better organized than the potential beneficiaries of
greater international trade. As one observer put it, "there was no white corn growers association

ready to claim the benefits of expanded export opportunities into Mexico." or, as several
participants noted, nothing motivated a commodity group like "getting its ox gored."

30

Agricultural Provisions of NAFTA
Against the backdrop of the various producer interests, high-level negotiators for Mexico

and the United States agreed in February 1992 that all agricultural products would be included
in the long-run provisions for trade liberalization. The U.S. agricultural groups may have exerted

some influence on this decision but informally the U.S. negotiators attributed it largely to
willingness of Mexico to include its politically sensitive corn sector, leaving little room for other

exclusions. Canada continued to object to full coverage of the agriculwral provisions, and the
U.S. farm groups and others favoring liberalized trade were unable to exert sufficient influence

for their negotiators to extract Canadian concessions. Instead, the negotiators agreed that the
Canada-U.S. FFA was to remain in effect for bilateral Canadian-U.S. agricultural trade and a
similar bilateral agreement on agricultural tariffs and market access would be developed between

Mexico and Canada.
Agreements on the provisions of NAFTA were announced by the negotiating parties in

August 1992. For Mexico and the United States, the agricultural tariff and market access
provisions called for all nontariff barriers to convert to TRQs upon enactment. For imports above

the TRQs, over-quota tariffs were set to provide initial protection equivalent to the previous
nontariff measures. The over-quota tariffs were to be phased out over adjustment periods of 10

or, in some cases, 15 years. Almost 21 percent of the value of pre-NAFTA trade received this
type of adjustment mechanisms. An additional 23 percent of the value of pre-NAFrAtrade was
subject to straightforward phasing out of tariffs over S to 15 years, while about 56 percent of the

value of bilateral trade occurring under the pre-NAFTA restrictions already was, or was
scheduled under NAFTA to immediately become, duty free.

31

In addition to its market access and tariff provisions, NAFTA addressed issues concerning

grades and standards and sanitary and phytosanitary regulations related to human, animal and
plant health. Trade restrictions arising in these areas had traditionally been problematic and the

agreement enunciated principles intended to reduce these sources of friction. The principles
included that grades and standards be applied on a nondiscriminatory basis. Each country also

retained the right to maintain its own health and safety standards as long as they were
"scientifically based and administered in a forthright and expeditious manner." Detailed dispute
settlement procedures were established in an effort to provide a forum for resolution of conflicts
among the parties.
In comparison with the then-pending Uruguay Round GAfl negotiations and other efforts

to liberalize trade of agricultural products, the long-mn NAFFA provisions for agriculture were

a notable achievement. While placing no restrictions on domestic support levels, the long-mn
provisions accomplished the basic objectives with respect to trade barriers of the initial U.S. zero-

option GATF proposal. These results led Hufbauer and Schott to conclude, for example, that
there was "laudable progress in the liberalization of farm trade barriers." In their widely cited
NAFTA evaluation, they assigned an A grade to the outcomes of the negotiations for agriculwre.

one of the four highest grades assigned among 18 aspects of the agreement. Similarly, a key
U.S. agricultural negotiator expressed the exuberant view that NAFFA would create "the freest
trade in agricultural products between any two countries." Other anecdotal evidence also supports

a sense of accomplishment among the negotiators.

One can not be as sanguine about the short-mn NAFTA provisions for agriculture. For
the commodities protected by import quotas or licenses, market access under the initial TRQs was

32

based on 1989-1991 trade levels. Quantities receiving market access under the TRQs were
scheduled to increase at only a 3-percent annual compound rate. Over-quota tariffs provided high

levels of protection against additional imports in the short and medium run. Proposed initial
Mexican over-quota tariffs were 215 percent for corn and 260 percent for chicken, for example,

while proposed U.S. over-quota tariffs were 70 percent for cheeses and 123 percent for shelled
peanuts. Corn, dry edible beans, milk powder, and peanuts were considered particularly sensitive

commodities and received 1 5-year adjustment periods for phase out of the over-quota tariffs.

More complex protective TRQ transition mechanisms were negotiated for sugar. Mexico

agreed to raise its external sugar tariff to the U.S. over-quota level by the seventh year of the
agreement. Mexican access to the U.S. sugar market was restricted by a TRQ of 25,000 metric

tons during this period, with the over-quota tariff between Mexico and theUnited States phased
out over 15 years. Mexico gained increased low-duty access to the U.S. market after seven years
if it became a surplus sugar region based on domestic production and consumption, with unlimited

access for its surpluses if it became a surplus producer for two consecutive years. The
negotiators did not address the question of whether the United States would maintain its aggregate

global TRQ for sugar, in which case any Mexican surpluses would diverttrade from other foreign

suppliers, or whether U.S. commitments to other countries would be honored, in which case the
Mexican surpluses would put downward pressure on U.S. production andprices.
A complex TRQ was also negotiated for frozen concentrated orange juice, which had been

subject previously only to tariff barriers. The within-quota imports were assessed a tariff of onehalf the most-favored-nation (MFN) level. The over-quota tariffs were set initially at MFN rates,

33

then declined linearly by 15 percent during the first six years. remained constant for four years,

and were phased out over an additional five years.
Two additional adjustment mechanisms were included in the negotiated agreement to
address other concerns

of the U.S. producers of horticultural products. First, tariffs on

cucumbers, asparagus, broccoli, melons, dried onions, and garlic were phased out over 15 years
instead

of 10 years. Second, a mechanism named

a special safeguard was applied to seasonal

U.S. imports of tomatoes, peppers, onions, eggplants, squash, and watermelons. The special
safeguard commodities were to have TRQs with 10-year periods of adjustment but the over-quota
tariffs were held at MFN levels during the adjustment period, then eliminated in one step at the

end.

A final adjustment mechanism was provided by the emergency action provisions of the
agreement. During the transition periods, a tariff reduction could be suspended and the MFN
tariff rate reestablished for up to four years if imports were found to have become, or to threaten

to become, a substantial cause of serious injury to a domestic industry. The investigating
authority for emergency action decisions for the United States was the International Trade
Commission TC). Emergency actions were limited to a single application for any commodity
and such actions could only be applied with the consent of, and compensation to. the other party

after the transition period had expired.

From these brief descriptions of the transition mechanisms for agricultural trade, the
influence of various producer groups on the negotiations is evident. Within the framework of
long-mn liberalization of trade with Mexico, likely gainers among U.S. producers confronted the

lengthy adjustment mechanisms included to protect Mexican farmers. Import-competing U.S.

34

commodities were provided with similar adjustmentprotection. Given these provisions, the endconstraint of complete tariff elimination is crucial to the assertion that NAFTA accomplished

long-run bilateral trade liberalization for agriculture.

Estimated Effects of the Agricultural Provisions
Several quantitative estimates have been made of the long-run effects of NAFTA on

Mexican-U.S. agricultural trade. The range of these estimates is illustrated in table 7. The
results from a model developed by Orennes and Krissoff (1993) with support from USDA are
compared to composite assessments underlying the preliminary (September 1992) and revised

(March 1993) reports from the Secretary of Agriculture's Office of Economics. The latter
assessments were frequently used by the Bush and Clinton administrations in congressional
testimony and elsewhere.

Grennes and Krissoff developed a 29-commodity, three-region (Mexico, United States,
rest-of-world) partial equilibrium model using the Armington assumption that commodities from
different regions are close but imperfect substitutes. An equilibrium solution estimated under the
assumption that agricultural trade barriers between Mexico and the United States were eliminated

was compared to the equilibrium solution obtained incorporating price differentials equivalent to

the tariffs and nontariff bathers in 1988. Thus, Grennes and Krissoff estimated the long-run
impact of NAFTA on annual trade flows with technology and national incomes implicitly held
constant.
Consistent with the basic comparative advantages reflected in the pre-NAFTA trade flows,

the Grennes-Krissoff model showed an increase in U.S. grain, oilseed and livestock exports to

Mexico under NAFFA, while Mexico increased its exports of horticultural products and live
cattle. Agricultural exports from the United States to Mexico increased by $485 million annually

and agricultural imports from Mexico by $164 million. Grennes and Krissoff pointed out that
appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Mexican pesocould reverse the estimated net trade
effects, and Grennes (1993) noted that the discounted value of the gains from trade were reduced

substantially by the long transition periods involved.
In terms of adjustments within each country, the production and price of corn in Mexico
were estimated to decline by 7.3 percent and 15.9 percent, respectively, in the Grennes-Krissoff
model, with proportional impacts on other coarse grains. The impacts on U.S. grain and oilseed

production and prices were positive but negligible. Effects on the livestock sector were also
relatively larger in Mexico than in the United States. Grennes and Krissoff did not model a shift

from sugar to corn sweeteners in the Mexican soft drink industry; thus, theyfound essentially no

change in Mexican-U.S. sugar trade. For the horticultural products included in their model,
Mexican production expanded while U.S. production and prices fell. No horticultural product
experienced a production or price decrease of more than 2 percent.
The results from the Grennes-Krissoff model suggest moderate overall benefits of NAFTA

for U.S. agricultural producers. The reports by USDA's Office of Economics asserted a more
positive view of NAFTA's potential beneficial impacts. The analysis for these reports was based

on a variety of USDA model outcomes and analysts' judgements. It also incorporated estimated
demand effects resulting from a projected increase in annual economic growth in Mexico of 0.5

percent due to NAFTA.

37

The final Office of Economics report concluded that U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico

were likely to be more than $2.5 billion higher annually with NAFTA by the end of the 15-year
adjustment period--an increase five times the level estimated by Grennes and Krissoff--while

imports of agricultural products from Mexico would increase by $500 to $600 million. The
difference between the export estimates by the Office of Economics and Grennes-Krissoff is
attributable mostly to greater exports of income-responsive livestock and poultry ($1,508 million
compared to $48 million), with somewhat greater exports of grains and oilseeds, dairy products

and fruits and vegetables. The Office of Economics estimated greater U.S. imports of cattle,
horticultural commodities and other products.

Among the commodities protected by U.S. import quotas, the Office of Economics
concluded that exports of U.S. milk powder to Mexico were expected "to grow by about 20,000
metric tons by the end of the 15-year transition period," while Mexican exports of dairy products

to the United States were unlikely to increase. The Office of Economics concluded that U.S.
exports of both raw cotton and the cotton equivalent of textiles and apparel would increase under

NAFTA. and that the U.S. would "enhance its role as a major supplier of peanuts to Mexico,'
with "little reason to expect Mexico to become a significant supplier of peanuts."
The reports by the Office of Economics downplayed the possibility of adverse impacts of

NAFFA on domestic producers of sugar and winter fruits and vegetables. Specific estimates of

the value of increased imports were not published but the final report concluded that it was
"uncertain to what extent Mexico might achieve a net production surplus" for sugar and that "any

net production surplus would likely develop gradually because of ... the constraints to switching

to corn sweeteners in the Mexican soft drink industry." For winter fruits and vegetables, the

38

Office of Economics concluded that any price effects would be moderated by the 10 and 15-year
adjustment periods and the special safeguards. The potential increased competition for citrus was
acknowledged with the qualifier that the effects on the U.S. industry were "expected to be small"

(U.S. imports 'about 3-4 percent higher with NAFTA" and U.S. prices slightly lower").

Interest Group Assessments of the Agreement
The USTR's Agricultural Policy Advisory Committee and ten Agricultural Technical
Advisory Committees completed their legislatively mandated assessments of NAFTA in September

1992. The APAC generally reflected the position of the American Farm Bureau Federation,
concluding that it !Pbelieves that the proposed NAFTA provides long-term net export growth
opportunities for U.S. agriculture and is in the economic interest of the United States."
The commodity groups that had supported bilateral trade liberalization under the agreement

were also mostly satisfied with the results of the negotiations. In their ATAC report, the feed

grain representatives stated that their market access objectives "had been met. l The oilseed

producers and processors noted that the agreement "will afford the U.S. industry with a
comparative advantage in the Mexican market over imports from competing suppliers in South
America, Europe and elsewhere." Livestock (and poultry and egg) producers concluded that the
negotiations were generally successful but called attention to the "glaring differences in state and

national veterinary service infrastructure.' They noted the need for "animal health programs to
be in place in Mexico that will protect the livestock industries of both countries.' Subsequently,
the livestock producers expressed renewed concerns when Mexico imposed new tariffs of 15 to

25 percent on livestock and meat products in November 1992. The National Cattlemen's

39

Association saw NAFTA as an opportunity to remove these tariffs and the threat of future tariffs.
Support for the negotiated agricultural provisions of NAFTA was also expressed by many

food processing industries.

Representatives of the industrial sweetener users expressed

appreciation for 'the manner in which the trade negotiators have endeavored to keep us informed

of the details of these complex negotiations" and strongly supported the agreement. The
Processed Foods Technical Advisory Committee (except citrus) also supported the agreementbut

pointed out that its acceptance of tariffication of Section 22 quotas under NAFTA was "based
solely on the status of production/consulflptionCoflSideratioflS in the three countries." Similarly.

the Dairy Technical Advisory Committee, white noting that the dairy sector opposedtariffication
of Section 22 quotas, concluded that the TRQs and rules-of-origin provisions were "sufficient to

prevent disruptive levels of dairy imports" and that U.S. dairy producerswould benefit if it were

able to take advantage of the export opportunities NAFTA created.
In contrast to these expressions of support for NAFTA (even with technicalreservations).

many of the agricultural groups that had sought limits on the agreement were not satisfied with
the negotiated outcomes. The National Farmers Union continued to express broad oppositionto
the agreement and wheat producers expressed dissatisfaction that their concernsabout Canadian

Wheat Board pricing and grain transportation subsidies were not addressed. The National
Association of Wheat Growers acknowledged that there had been a lot of access to the negotiating

process but concluded that "whether you get what you want is another question." Their ATAC

representative viewed the Republican administration as unresponsive. Foreshadowing the
bargaining that would occur during the congressional debate to follow, he recommended that the

important matters (concerning Canada) be addressed in the implementing legislation.'

40

The import-quota-protected sectors other than dairy also Continued to express opposilion

to NAFTA. Cotton producers noted their opposition to elimination of Section 22 quotas and
argued that there were 'no reliable estimates of how traditional cropping patterns will be affected

by provisions of the NAFTA.' Cotton processors, in contrast, endorsed the agreement but not
"expansion of NAFTA to include other countries."
Peanut producers and shelters remained more unified in their opposition to the agreement.

They called attention to Canada's exclusion of "sensitive products" and concluded that "the U.S.

government should have insisted on the same provisions for U.S. Section 22 commodities," The
Washington representative of many of the state peanut organizations faulted the U.S. negotiators
for not attaining this outcome but gave credit to Congressman de Ia Garza, chairman of the House

Agriculture Committee, for "taking care" of peanut concerns for tough rules of origin "as late as
the last day of the negotiations."
Sugar producers also remained unified in their opposition to the outcome of the NAFTA
negotiations. They accused the administration of being out to "get sugar" and objected that the
negotiations proceeded "in great haste and unprecedented secrecy." Twisting the effects of high
domestic sugar prices to their own ends, the producers argued That their sector had gone through

a difficult rationalization to, as they put it, "modernize the domestic industry." They argued that
it would be "unfair" for them to bear the burden of adjustment if lower Mexican corn prices and
higher sugar prices resulted in similar "modernization" in Mexico--with use of high-fructose corn

sweeteners in the soft drink industry and consequent sugar surpluses and exports. The U.S.

producers asserted that they had "no hand" in the provisions that were included in the negotiated
agreement and called for two fundamental modifications. First, they argued that the Mexican

41

surplus status should be calculated "not just on the basis of sugar, but on caloric sweeteners,
including corn sweeteners." Second, they argued that Mexican access to the U.S. market should

"be capped at a growing TRQ' for the full 15-year adjustment period even if Mexico became a
surplus producer for two consecutive years. Representatives of the producers on the sweeteners

ATAC also raised concerns about whether NAFTA would be extended to other countries.
Although not mentioned specifically, these countries potentially included Cuba with its sugar
surpluses of more than 5 MMT.

Finally, the horticultural sector, like the cotton industry, held mixed views about the
negotiated agreement. Winter fruit and vegetable producers in florida continued to oppose
NAFTA. The florida producers felt they had pursued all of the avenues open to participating
in the negotiations and viewed their access to the negotiators as good throughout most of the
process.

In the end, however, like the sugar producers, they concluded that the Bush

administration had "failed to honor its commitment to Congress to provide protection for the most
sensitive products." The Florida producers suggested again that some winter fruits and vegetables

be excluded from the agreement. At a minimum, they argued that the tariff phase-out periods

be extended to 20 years for sensitive commodities, with more commodities included in the
category subject to the longest transition. Reactions of other horticultural producers illustrated

the diversity of interests within this sector. California producers generally expressed less
opposition to the agreement than producers in Florida. The U.S. wine industry, in particular, was

dissatisfied with the length of the phase-out periods for Mexican tariffs. Together with potato

producers, who had similar concerns, the wine industry concluded it could not support the
agreement unless more favorable access to the Mexican market were obtained.

42

Survey by the Senate Committee

To complement USTR's advisory committee reports and other expressions of the views

of producers and other interested parties, Senators Leahy and Lugar, chairman and ranking
member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, conducted a survey of

opinions about NAFTA. As had been done for previous important policy decisions, the survey
was mailed to 300 groups and individuals identified by the committee staff as having an interest
in the issues. By June 1993, 124 responses were received. The relatively low response rate may

suggest that the survey was not considered the most effective means to express an opinion to
Congress by many interest groups. Nevertheless, the responses provide a broad overview of the

positions of the various agricultural interests.

Based on a qualitative analysis of the responses (e.g., stated position, strength of the
language, number of caveats), 24 provided strong support for the agreement, 51 provided support,

21 were opposed, nine were strongly opposed, and 19 took no position.5 Among the generalmembership organizations, positions remained divided. Several government and public agencies

submitted letters (with opposition from Florida and support from Arizona, California and Texas),
and the embassies of five Caribbean countries submitted an unsolicited letter of opposition because

of potential reductions of their sugar TRQs. Grain and oilseed producers and some livestock
groups were supportive of the agreement but others had reservations or had not taken a position.

The dairy and cotton respondents were divided between supporters and those not having a
position, while peanut and sugar producers expressed their strong opposition. Respondents among

survey responses is available on request.

43

horticultural interests again reflected diverse views, with opposition expressed by the coalition of

Florida producers. Food processors and suppliers and the forestry industry overwhelmingly

supported NAFTA, while the United Food and Commercial Workers. AFL-CIO, expressed
organized labor's opposition, citing particularly its concern that NAFTA would cause meatpacking jobs to move from the United States to Mexico.
One interesting aspect of the letters received by the Senate Committee is that supporters

tended to identify fewer specifics than opponents. There were an average of 3.86 and 5.47
comments per letter from those providing strong support or support, respectively, compared to

7.41 and 7.88 from those opposed and strongly opposed. Supporters also tended to be less

focused on their perceptions of benefits than opponents were on their concerns. Among
respondents providing strong support, an average of almost 80 percent of the comments were
expressions of benefits. This share dropped to 46 percent among respondents providing support.

In contrast, essentially all of the comments of respondents expressing opposition or strong
opposition were objections to the agreement.

To summarize the positions of agricultural interest groups at the conclusion of the NAFTA
negotiations, there was widespread support for the agreement among the American Farm Bureau

Federation and other market-oriented general-membership fann organizations, from the export-

oriented producer groups for most grains, oilseeds, livestock, and some horticultural products,
from food processors and suppliers, and, among the sectors protected by import quotas, within
the dairy and cotton industries. Opposition was expressed by general-membership organizations
such as the National Farmers Union that favor domestic supply controls, labor unions, and some

social and environmental groups. Wheat producers withheld support in an effort to obtain

44

leverage on Canadian export pricing issues, while producers of peanuts, sugar, winter vegetables,

and citrus and other wiruer fruits expressed opposition to specific provisions of the agreement.

Side Agreements and Implementing Legislation
After the November 1992 elections, the Clinton administration followed through on its

campaign pledge not to reopen negotiations on the original NAFTA text but to negotiate
supplemental (side) agreements with respect to the environment, labor and import surges. The
administration worked closely with a coalition of private organizations during the negotiations for
the environmental side agreement and won the endorsement of NAFTA by seven of the principal

groups. The negotiations on the labor side agreement were less ambitious than the negotiations

on the environment and did not satisfy the concerns of organized labor nor its principal supporters

in Congress. The AFL-CIO had essentially indicated it would oppose NAFFAregardless of the
outcome of the side negotiations and subsequently declared its continued intent to defeat the
NAFTA implementing legislation in the House of Representatives.
The side agreement on import surges provided the framework in which concerns of the
various agricultural producer interests might have been addressed. The change in administration

had given the groups opposed to specific aspects of NAFTA a second hearing. The sugar
producers, in particular, found a receptive audience. One key Capital Hill staff person expressed

the view that the Bush administration had done poorly on the initial agreement for agriculture.
especially for sugar. This concern was quickly recognized by the designated United States Trade

Representative, Mickey Kantor. As early as his January 1993 preconfirmation hearings, he
pointed out that the side agreement on import surges would "affect agriculture and particularly

45

be protective, we hope, of the sugar industry, if such a surge should take place" (U.S. Senate.
Committee on Finance, 1993).
Despite this expressed interest in providing strengthened protection, the side agreement
negotiated by the Clinton administration only established a consultative working groupto consider

issues related to the original NAFTA emergency action provisions. While the deliberations of
the working group could expedite subsequent consideration of industry injury claims under these
provisions, the side agreement did not address the types of changes sought in the initial provisions

by the agricultural producer groups.
As the negotiations for the three side agreements carried into the late summer of 1993,
the Clinton administration withheld active support for NAFT A pending their conclusion. Internal

debate continued within the administration over the level of priority to place on the passage of

NAFTA. In the meantime, between the signing of the initial agreement in December 1992 and

completion of the side agreements in August 1993. increased opposition to NAFTA was
articulated by individuals and groups that included some of the Democratic leadership of
Congress, the AFL-CIO, third-party presidential aspirant Ross Perot, some environmental,civil
rights and consumer groups, and conservatives such as Pat Buchanan and others.

A setback for supporters of NAFTA came on June 30 when a federal district judge ruled

that its implementation required an environmental impact statement. This ruling could have
indefinitely delayed consideration of the agreement by Congress.

A subsequent low point for NAFTA supporters caine after the congressional recess in
August. Many members of Congress were bombarded by the vocal opposition toNAFTA by

Ross Perot's supporters and others within their districts. Crucial Republican support for the
agreement seemed to be slipping. One high-ranking member of the White I-louse NAFTA task

46

force observed that the Perot supporftrs had done to Republican support for NAFTA what
organized labor had done to the support among Democrats.

In this setting, President Clinton used the September 13, 1993 signing ceremony for the
side agreements to launch an intense campaign for implementation of the agreement. The ruling
that NAFTA required an environmental impact statement was overturned on September 24 by a

unanimous decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals. The Clinton administration then proceeded
with efforts to build a broad public case for the benefits of NAFTA and to pursue the necessary

votes in Congress "one or two and five or ten at a time.' Agricultural interest groups played a
role in each of these strategies.

A! for NAFTA and the Citizens Trade CamDai2n

When it became apparent that NAFTA was in trouble in Congress several of the
agricultural groups began to consider ways of making a more visible show of support. Their
perception early in the summer was that agriculture was viewed as divided on NAFTA not as an

industry that would benefit. Five groups—the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National
Corn Growers Association, the National Cattlemen's Association, the National Pork Producers

Council, and Farmland Industries—formed an umbrella support organization called Ag for

NAFTA. Membership was open to any agricultural group willing to add its name with no
financial or other commitments required. Ag for NAFTA lent its support to the broader pro-

agreement coalition USA*NAFTA but remained separate in its financing, organizing and
activities.
The perception of the Ag for NAFTA organizers was that the Clinton administration was
'hungry for support" since there was little grassroots effort developing in favor of the agreement.
Ag for NAFTA brought 150 farm representatives to Washington at the end of July and sponsored
47

a variety of publicity activities. The staff person responsible for spearheading Ag for NAFFA
expressed the view that these activities (including press conferences at the House of
Representatives and with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor) c'tcompletely turned

around perceptions of agriculture's views." He rated their success on this initial objective as
"excellent." By September, Ag for NAFTA had 140 affiliated organizations.
The next objective of Ag for NAFTA was to reassure members of Congress that they had

a base of support if they voted for the agreement. One hundred and seventy members were
targeted for attention. The tactic was simply to tiy to insure that these members heard from their

constituents in support of NAFFA at town meetings, office visits and through the mail.
A third activity of Ag for NAFTA was to build grassroots support for the agreement
among their constituents. The organizers felt members of their own groups had been "bombarded

with the opposition position" and viewed it as crucial to counter some of the opposition statements

and dispel misconceptions among farmers. Supporters were encouraged to write to their
newspapers, participate in radio talk shows and take other steps to promote knowledge of the

benefits of the agreement for agriculture.

Much general commentary has been directed at the total levels of expenditures by
supporters and opponents in their efforts to affect the NAFTA negotiations and congressional

debate (see, for example, Grayson or Lewis and Ebrahim). In the context of these millions of
dollars, the scale of the Ag for NAFI'A activities was modest. The key organizer devoted about
one-half of his time to NAFTA and another staff person about one-fourth of her time. Ag for

NAFFA had an initial budget of about $10,000. The respective member organizations paid the
travel expenses of participants in Ag for NAFTA activities, and its final budget for publicity,

advertising and other expenses was less than $100,000.
48

In addition to the efforts of Ag for NAFTA, the American Farm Bureau Federation and
many of the specific commodity associations also devoted staff and resources to support passage

of the NAFFA implementing legislation. Again, a typical commitment involved the assignment

of one or two staff to preparation of informational materials and efforts to mobilize the
membership to support the agreement and convey their support to the public and Congress. The

representatives of these organizations widely acknowledged that their efforts would only be
successful if President Clinton was fully committed.

Opponents of NAFTA also continued to mobilize around the implementing legislation.
The National Farmers Union made defeat of NAFFA one of its top priorities. It was a founding

member of the Citizens Trade Campaign (CTC), the umbrella group that led the opposition

efforts, and provided the CTC with office space and other services. The NFU argued that
supporters of NAFTA had not done the grassroots organizing necessary to succeed, and launched

grassroots efforts of its own and in conjunction with the crc. While not formally aligned with
Ross Perot, representatives of the NFU believed he had changed the media dynamics and reduced

the prospects for passage of the implementing legislation.

Wheat Oooosition
Continuing their break with the other export-oriented commodity groups, wheat producers

held their support for NAFTA hostage to resolution of the price-transparency and transportationsubsidy issues with Canada. Their representatives viewed these as issues on which they would

"never give up.

In exchange for their support for NAFTA, the wheat producers asked the

administration to take action under the emergency provisions of Section 22. The emergency
provisions permit the Secretary of Agriculture to recommend immediate quotas or tariffs rather
than wait for an ITC investigation and ruling. The wheat producers resisted prodding to join the
49

NAFTA supporters unless their contentions toward Canada were addressed. A representative of
the National Association of Wheat Growers viewed as its trump card an ability to "provide a level

of comfort to members on the fence who want to vote for NAFTA but need political cover." He

expected "a lot of hard bargaining" before the implementing legislation was approved.
Division Among the lmDort-cluota and TRO Protected Commodities
The import-quota and TRQ protected commodities pursued the different approaches to the

implementing legislation suggested by the particular circumstances of each sector. Consistent

with the dairy ATAC report, the National Milk Producers Federation adopted a position of
support for the agreement during the summer of 1993. Representatives of the NMPF met with
Mickey Kantor to point out that it was the first Section 22 group to endorse a trade agreement.
They asked for his support in return on favorable levels of dairy market access to be negotiated

in the GAYF Uruguay Round. The NMPF also sought support for its view that the provisions
of the Canada-U.S. FFA requiring elimination of agricultural tariffs would apply retroactively to

dairy products if Canada were to tariffy its quantitative daily trade bathers under a GAIT
agreement. Such an interpretation of the language and intent of the Canada-U.S. agreement had
been consistently opposed by Canadian milk producers and the Canadian negotiators.

The National Cotton Council of America also endorsed NAFTA in October 1993 rather
than hold out for final concessions. The producer members of the Council continued to express
reservations about the agreement but agreed not to oppose the processors' consensus in its favor.

The NCCA made it clear, however, that it did not support the provisions of the pending GAiT
agreement with respect to cotton.

While dairy and cotton interests moved toward support of NAFTA, peanut producers

remained opposed. Some state organizations (in particular. Georgia) were very active in

50

opposition. Other state organizations took a less active role because they didn't want to alienate

Congressman de Ia Garza after his efforts on their behalf. The Washington lobbyist for the
producers pressed ahead with efforts to influence the implementing legislation and the producer

groups kept pressure on the members of Congress from districts where they had strength. The
peanut producers indicated that the intensity of their final opposition to NAFTA would depend
on the assurances provided in the implementing legislation in terms of blocking transshipments,

quality control and other issues affecting access to their protected market.

Cane and beet sugar producer groups were also united on opposition to NAFTA. The
sugar producers made strong efforts to obtain their two modifications of the initial agreement:
inclusion of corn sweeteners in determining the balance of production and consumption affecting

Mexican access to the U.S. sugar market and a ceiling on Mexico's access for the full 15-year
adjustment period. The sugar producers lobbied USDA and USTR and pressed their case through

the Senate sweeteners caucus. A letter of support for the producers signed by 34 senators was
given to the Secretary of Agriculture just prior to his consultations with the Mexican government

in late August, together with separate letters of support from Senators Conrad and Dole, a letter
of concern signed by ambassadors from 16 Caribbean-Basin-Initiativecountries, and the transcript

of a public meeting intended to show that the Mexican sugar industry had advised its government

that it did not object to the U.S. producers' recommendations. The sugar. producers were
satisfied that the U.S.Trade Representative understood their concerns and was sympathetic to
them. Nevertheless, they committed to "go hell bent to defeat NAFFA' if the agreement was not

revised. On September 27, they pledged up to $500,000 to a campaign of opposition, indicating
that their opposition would be withdrawn if their specific concerns were addressed.

51

The demands of the sugar producers brought into focus the competing interests of different

commodity groups within U.S. agriculture and the relative strength of the Mexican and U.S.

negotiating positions. The National Corn Growers Association indicated
provisions could be modified without changing the negotiated corn TRQ (2.5 MMT, compared
to the 3.5 MMT the producers had sought initially) then they would not object, even though the

modification would reduce the liketihood of additional demand being created by a shift to corn
sweeteners in the Mexican soft drink industry. The corn growers indicated they would oppose

modifying the initial sugar agreement if it involved lowering the negotiated corn TRQ.
The sugar issues were even tougher on the Mexican side. Mexico was going to give up
its traditional and politically sensitive protection for corn under NAFTA and sought access to the

U.S. sugar market as a potential opportunity for some of its agricultural producers. While
Mexican consumer well-being would be improved by lower corn prices, more than offsetting the

loss to producers, sugar prices for consumers were to rise under NAFTA if Mexico fulfilled its

pledge to raise tariffs on non-NAFrA countries to the U.S. over-quota level. The opportunity
to sell some of its sugar in the protected U.S. market would offset part of the cost to Mexican
consumers of adjusting to U.S. sugar policies. The Mexican negotiators had worked hard for
concessions on sugar, although, as indicated in the sweeteners ATAC report and elsewhere, most

participants in the negotiations agreed that the Bush administration had not particularly resisted

provisions that might put pressure on the U.S. sugar program. In any case, Mexico did not
consent to modifying the sugar provisions of the initial August 1992 agreement until it became

critical to do so near the end of the U.S. congressional deliberations.

The Florida Coalition
Working along commodity lines as well as through the unified position among agricultural

groups within the state, the Florida coalition pressed further for accommodation of the concerns
of sugar, winter vegetables, and citrus and other winter fruits. The fruit and vegetable producers
continued to seek longer tariff phase-out periods for more commodities and price-based importsurge safeguard mechanisms. They also continued to express concern about the effects on their
competitiveness of disparities in environmental and labor regulations. A key citrus representative

described their particular goal as "a safeguard whereby if Mexico sells below a breakeven price

for Florida producers, then the tariff will snap back in place."

Characterizing this as

a"permanent" system, he argued for a tariff equal to the differences in costs of production
between Florida and Mexico. This was the type of bather to trade popularized under the name
of a "social tariff" by Ross Perot in his highly-visible anti-NAFTA campaign (Perot and Choate,
1993).

The coalition of Florida agricultural producers remained central to the NAFTA debate by

working closely with the state's congressional delegation.

Throughout the congressional

deliberations about NAFTA legislation, almost the entire Florida delegation of 10 Democrats and
13 Republicans remained on record as opposed to the agreement.

End Game Concessions
As the November 17 vote on the NAFFA implementing legislation approached, the
administration continued to struggle to assemble a supportive coalition.

Leaders of the

opposition, including Congressman David Bonior the second-ranked member of the Democratic
congressional leadership, claimed to be closing in on the votes needed to defeat the legislation.
53

Organized labor, the Citizens Trade Campaign. Ross Perot, and others pressed their opposition
in public forums and congressional lobbying.

With the fate of the agreement uncertain in the House of Representatives, the agricultural
commodity groups were positioned to play a significant role in the bargaining to win support for
the implementing legislation. Unlike organized labor and other opponents publicly committed to

defeat of the agreement in its entirety, most of the agriculturalcommodity groups had expressed
opposition only to specific aspects of the agreement. Moreover, between the Florida delegation

and the sugar, peanut and wheat interests, a large number of congressional votes rested at least
in part on satisfying the concerns of the agricultural producers.

The end game exploded into public view in early November. Concessions obtained for
agriculture in the last two weeks of the debate are summarized in table 8.
Initial Letters and Concessions

An initial November 3 letter from the U.S. Trade Representative to Mexico's Secretary of
Commerce addressed concerns of the wine industry. The letter indicated that the United States
would seek mutual agreement to accelerated tariff reductions for wine and brandy (as well as flat

glass, home appliances and bedding components).

A second and more significant letter confirmed the trade representative's understanding
that the two parties had agreed that substitution of corn syrup for sugar could "result in effects

not intended by either Party" and that subsequently they had reached an agreement that
consumption of corn syrup would be included in the detennination of "net production surplus."
The letter also indicated an agreement that notwithstanding previous provisions, the ceiling for
Mexican sugar sales in the United States under NAFFA would be 250,000 MT for the seventh

through fourteenth years. In short, Mexico had conceded to the demands of the U.S. sugar

producers. Subsequently, the sugar industry indicated it would withdraw its opposition to
NAFTA. At least a dozen votes in the House of Representatives were expected to be influenced
to support the implementing legislation by the decisions of the sugar associations.

A third letter between the U.S. and Mexican negotiators addressed the issue of a pricebased safeguard for citrus. The letter specified that the countries had agreed that if the U.S. price

of fresh concentrated orange juice dropped below an average based on the preceding five years
for five consecutive days then the United States could apply the prevailing MFN rate of duty on

imports from Mexico in excess of 70 million gallons annually through 2002 and in excess of 90
million gallons annually during 2003-2007. This change provided only a modest modification of

the original citrus provisions, nothing like the social tariff protection that had been called for by
some representatives of the industry.
In addition to this modest change in the provisions of NAFTA. the citrus producers had
bargained for other concessions from the administration. The Board of Directors of Florida Citrus

Mutual voted to withdraw their opposition to the agreement on November 10. They announced

that the association had won three additional concessions: that tariffs on all forms of fresh and
processed citrus products would not be cut more than 15 percent under the Uruguay-Round GAY!'

agreement, that non-NAFTA citrus juices would be reclassified as perishable commodities under

U.S. law (expediting future injury claims by the industry), and that no foreign citrus products
would receive additional special status under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) or the

Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI).
As the anti-NAFTA Florida coalition collapsed and momentum was gained for passage of

the implementing legislation by Congress, the other Florida fruit and vegetable producers also

sought accommodation with the administration.
56

Their representatives were not offered

modifications of the agreement that required the concurrence of Mexico. Instead, they were
offered a range of administrative concessions in exchange for helping deliver support for NAFTA

from the Florida congressional delegation. These concessions included the use of an early
warning import-surge mechanism and limits for certain commodities with respect to OAT!', the

GSP and the CDI similar to those offered for citrus. They also included an environmentally
controversial postponement of decertification of methyl bromide for use as a soil fumigant until
2000 and funding for research intended to "insure that Florida agriculture would continue to have

access to commercially viable technologies" for soil treatment and post-harvest fumigation
(including funding for a particular horticultural research station). Finally, the administration
agreed to increase purchases of fresh tomatoes and sweet corn for school lunch programs. Based

on these concessions, the Board of Directors of the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association
announced they had voted to withdraw its opposition to MAFIA on November 11.

The Final Days

With less than a week before the scheduled congressional vote and with leaders of the

opposition still claiming they would defeat NAFTA in the House of Representatives, the
administration and its supporters could not ease up on their attempts to obtain passage of the
implementing legislation. The Ag for NAFTA coalition sponsored a "fly in" that brought 50 to

60 leaders of various member organizations to Washington for a final effort to lobby on behalf
of the agreement. They contributed to the decisions of a number of undecided representatives but

the real action was with the groups that had been or remained opposed.
The wheat producers engaged in tense late—deal bargaining. They had been able to insert
into the implementing legislation a provision for end-use certificates for wheat and barley intended

to counteract their use by Canada and insure that Canadian products did not receive U.S. export

57

subsidies. However, the producers' earlier hopes for emergency Section 22 import quotas were
scuttled when, by several accounts, the administration determined that the wheat growers could

not influence sufficiently many congressional votes,

The wheat producers were told

"emphatically" that the administration would not take emergency Section 22 action. However,
the president agreed to accommodate the producers by asking the ITC to initiate a Section 22

investigation in 60 days to determine whether imports from Canada were interfering with the

wheat support programs of the Department of Agriculture. The ITC investigation would be
undertaken unless there were successful bilateral negotiations to address Canadian policies.
including "transportation subsidies and Canadian Wheat Board pricing practices." A letter from
the president to this effect was sent to the ITC and several individual congressmen on November
IS. The next day. less than 36 hours before the scheduled vote in the House of Representatives,

the National Association of Wheat Growers announced it would "now work for congressional

approval of NAFTA."
Partly on the basis of the wheat concessions, five congressmen, including two counted by
the Associated Press as leaning against the agreement and two counted as undecided, announced

their support for the implementing legislation. One of these representatives. Congressman
English, was also concerned about illegal transshipment of peanuts and beef through Mexico. To
address the oppositionof the peanut producers and Congressman English's concerns, the president

committed the administration to bilateral consultations on imports of peanut butter from Canada

and to a second ITC investigation within 60 days if necessary. The Secretary of Agriculture
assured one congressman that he would "work vigorously ... to limit the volume of Canadian
exports of peanut butter and paste, which would include your suggestion of a cap at 1 percent of
U.S. domestic consumption." Congressman English. who resigned shortly after the NAFFA vote
58

to accept an appointment as head of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, was also

assured by the Commissioner of Customs that there would he "at least ten visits to agricultural
processing sites in Mexico" and that '350 positions, including 100 newly hired employees" would

he assigned to enforcement of the NAFTA rules of origin.
Final critical decisions were made by the Florida congressional delegation. It scheduled
a closed—door meeting on Tuesday, November 16. An Associated Press poll had counted only

five of the 23 members of the delegation as supporting or leaning toward supporting the
agreement the previous day, so a large number of votes were at stake. Some ol the Florida
agricultural producer groups, and many of the individual producers, disagreed with the decisions

of Florida Citrus Mutual and the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association to withdraw their
opposition. Moreover, the case against NAFTA had been made on numerous grounds in Florida.
Not all of the state's congressional representatives seemed convinced that the accommodations

offered to agriculture were sufficient for them to support the agreement.

A pivotal senior member of the Florida delegation was Representative Tom Lewis who
served on the House Committee on Agriculture. To provide Congressman Lewis with assurance

about his concerns required an additional letter from Mickey Kantor specifying that NAFTA
contained "effective price and volume-based snaphack provisions to deal with increased imports
of fresh tomatoes and peppers." The next day, Congressman Lewis and 12 other members of the

delegation voted with the administration. The NAFFA implementing legislation passed in the
House of Representative by a 234 to 200 majority.
Unconfirmed Deals
In addition to thc confirmed concessions and assurances and the votes that went with them,

there were rumors in the press oF more insidious dealmaking. One rumor was that the
59

administration would back away from its intention to raise grazing fees on federal lands from

$1.86 to $4.28 per animal unit in exchange for support for NAFTA from ten western
congressmen. The Interior Department denied such a connection (Wall Street Journal, November

10, 1993) but the administration subsequently partially backed down and proposed raising the
grazing fees to $3.96 over three years.

It was also rumored that the $0.75 per pack increase in the cigarette tax proposed to

finance health care reform might be scaled back in exchange for support for NAFFA. The
administration denied such a deal but two North Carolina Democrats, Charles Rose and Steve
Neal, who had previously been opposed or leaning toward opposition ended up voting in favor
of the implementing legislation after several meetings with House Ways and Means Committee
chairman Dan Rostenkowski. Congressman Neal denied his vote on NAFTA had anything to do

with the tobacco tax and Congressman Rose, while vague, acknowledged that the president had

not promised him anything (Wall Street Journal, November 19. 1993). The. $0.75 tax was
subsequently included in the president's proposed 1995 budget.

In the context of these rumors of possible dealmaking on issues not directly related to
trade, it is of interest that one possible deal never seemed to be under consideration. Concurrent
with the NAFTA debate, the administration was engaged in court-ordered discussions with Florida

sugar and fruit and vegetable producers seeking an out-of-court settlement on a program to restore

the Everglades. At issue were how to purge agricultural runoff of phosphorous and other
chemicals and who would pay the costs of such efforts. The producers had agreed to take some

land out of production to create filtration marshes but the talks broke down in December 1993

over their demands for strong assurances on the limits of their future obligations. Despite the

60

importance of the Florida delegation in the NAFTA debate, there was no linkage of the NAFTA
vote to this environmental negotiation.6

Conclusions from the NAFTA Outcomes
In drawing inferences about the political economy of trade protection on the basis of the

participation of various agricultural groups in the NAFTA negotiations and the congressional

debate over its implementing legislation, a crucial issue is the extent to which the process
provided a mechanism for overcoming established protection among agricultural sectors and

expanding international markets. The NAFTA outcomes highlight the dual character of
international negotiations that Putman (1988) has referred to as a simultaneous two-level game.
At one level, a framework has to be established for a mutually acceptable international agreement.

At a second level, any such agreement must be ratified within the domestic political processes of

the negotiating partners.

In the case of NAFTA, President Salinas and President Bush articulated support for
comprehensive liberalization of trade between Mexico and the United States. The high-level
decision to include all agricultural products under provisions for long-run trade liberalization was

endorsed by the Mexican side, within a relatively autocratic decision-making structure, and by
some U.S. agricultural interests.

The decision to achieve liberalization of agricultural trade in the long run achieved one
of the goals of the original U.S. zero-option GAIT proposal and established a strong objective
for the NAFFA negotiations, especially compared to the relatively weak provisions for agriculture

6

There was some discussion within the sugar industry of linking the two issues but it was
concluded that it would be infeasible to do so.

61

in previous trade agreements and the significant weakening of the zero-option in the Uruguay-

Round GAfl discussions. For this reason, the provisions for agriculture negotiated between
Mexico and the United States may deserve the 'A" grade received from Hutbauer and Schott in
their NAFTA evaluation. However. Canada resisted participating in an agreement of such broad

scope for agriculture. Those interests in the negotiations that favored trade liberalization lacked
sufficient influence to force Canadian concessions. Instead, Mexico and the United States settled

for extension of the less comprehensive bilateral agricultural market access provisions of the

previous Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and a similar agreement between Mexico and
Canada.

Once the broad direction of the NAFTA negotiations was set, the domestic political
process provided multiple points of access for interest groups in the United States to influence

specific provisions of the agreement. The politically palatable but conflicting principles that

expanded export opportunities were desirable but that imports should not cause too much
dismption of domestic industries guided the negotiations toward the tariftication of quantitative
import restrictions, with limited initial tariff-rate quotas, high initial over-quota tariffs, and long

transition periods for expanding market access and reducing tariff levels. Agricultural producer

groups were faced with either seeking concessions related to the parameters of the adjustment
mechanisms or simply opposing the agreement. Few of the agricultural groups chose outright

opposition. Rather, they acquiesced to the Bush and, subsequently. Clinton administrations'

support for the long-term objectives of the agreement but sought modifications of specific
adjustment provisions.

From the efforts made on NAFTA by interest groups within agriculture and more widely,

it is apparent that both groups that anticipated gains and those trying to avoid expected losses

62

were involved in the decision making process. To a large extent, agricultural interest group
responses to NAFTA were consistent with its estimated economic impacts. The signs of these
impacts, together with various nonquantitied related issues (particularly extension of NAFTA to

other countries), rather than the magnitude of the direct impacts often seemed important
determinants of interest group behavior. Accounting for some of the related issues brings a closer
correlation of the economic interests of some of the groups and their roles than is initially evident.

Given the different responses of various agricultural interest groups to NAFFA, questions
arise concerning the sources of influence they utilized to affect the negotiated agreement or obtain

subsequent concessions. A wide range of options were available, and groups generally
participated in the process in a variety of ways. A reasonable generalization is that groups that
found the broad outline of the negotiations amenable to their interests were able to work closely

with the negotiators and their technical staffs and some path toward liberalized trade was
achieved, while interest groups objecting to the general direction of the negotiations sought
redress through Congress.

Too much can be made, however, of the choice by interest groups among channels of
influence on purely institutional grounds. Despite the broad commitment to the trade agreement

by both the Bush and Clinton administrations, receptivity to the interests of specific groups
changed after the 1992 election. In particular, support for the sugar program is usually identified

with the Democratic Party and the tension between sugar producer groups and the trade
negotiators during the Bush administration is not disputed by participants in the process. The
Clinton administration signaled very early that it was more receptive to the concerns of the sugar

producers and this receptivity was reflected in executive branch channels. Likewise, wheat
producers didn't expect much support from a Republican executive branch. Thus, even with
63

bipartisan support for NAFTA. there was a partisan aspect to the avenuesthat were effective for
specific commodity groups.

More generally, there is a widespread supposition that interest groups likely to benefit
from expanded export opportunities have difficulty becoming as organized on their own behalf
as interests likely to face increased competition (with reference to agriculture, see, for example,

McCalla, 1993). This supposition is confirmed by various aspects of the agricultural interest
groups activities on NAFTA. These aspects include the relative attention to NAFTA in different

agricultural magazines, the observations of participants on the degree to which potential losses
motivated commodity group involvement, the intensity of the opponents' responses to the survey
by the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, the resources committed to the

debate over the implementing legislation by various producer groups, and the ability of the
various groups to mobilize their supporters.

Another set of questions related to the activities of specific interest groups pertains to
unanimity of the sectors seeking liberalization or protection. In the case of NAFTA, the strongest

coalition to emerge naturally was the geographic coalition in Florida. The key members of the
coalition were sugar, winter vegetables, and citrus and other winter fruits. The Florida coalition
had a strong presence during the negotiations and legislative deliberations but its unanimity broke

down in the final days of the congressional debate. Sugar was the most protected of the
commodities in the coalition. Florida sugar producers, acting in unison with sugar producers in
other pans of the country, were able to strike their own deal with the Clinton administration and
obtain substantial concessions. The other Florida commodities receive less protection than sugar.

The producers of these commodities had no similar natural allies elsewhere and were less

64

successful in their bargaining. Thus, the Florida coalition was only partially helpful in obtaining
concessions for its member groups.

Some other coalitions that might have emerged during the NAFTA process were not
evident among either export-oriented or import-competing interests. Notwithstanding the efforts

of Ag for NAFTA, the divisions among the general-membership farm organizations precluded
a united approach for the likely exporters. Among the grains, wheat had idiosyncratic issues that

affected its approach to the negotiations and even some corn growers opposed the agreement.
Among the import-competing commodities, the specifics of NAFTA looked favorable to the dairy
and cotton sectors but not to peanut and sugar producers. One can disagree with the analyses of

particular commodity groups, as USDA's Office of Economics did with the opposition expressed

by peanut producers, for example, but the point remains that the interest-group perceptions
precluded formation of coalitions. Issues extending beyond NAFTA were particularly important
in this regard. The dairy sector apparently anticipated better medium-term opportunities in world

markets (or simply more success in obtaining export subsidies) than the peanut or sugar sectors,
which face numerous pressures for greater foreign access to their domestic markets.
A second aspect to the unanimity issues concerns groups other than producers that might

benefit from trade or be harmed by protection. The sugar producers were opposed by the
industrial sweetener users but, as in many previous policy decisions, the sweetener users were

not very effective. Other processing and supply industries also supported NAFTA. The Food
Marketing Institute and others among these industries argued that the agreement would benefit

consumers through lower prices. The general public didn't express a strong position in terms
of consumer prices but was heard from in terms of environmental issues, labor issues and overall

65

political support for NAFTA. The proportion of the public favoring the agreement increased as
the congressional vote approached but remained less than 50 percent by most late polls.

A reason for some optimism in this context is that the final efforts to win support for
NAFTA were successful. A bipartisan coalition, of which agricultural interests were only a small

part, was marshalled to make the case for the agreement. The broad challenge to its leadership
by the AFL-CIO, Ross Perot and others was defeated. Thus, the danger that the U.S. would turn

conspicuously inward on such a fundamental economic and foreign policy decision was held at
bay in a post-Cold War setting. In this regard, unfortunately the disadvantages NAFTA created

for Japan and the Europeans were often touted as a theme. This argument undermined efforts

to liberalize trade on a multilateral basis, quite to the contrary of the intent of the original
consideration of bilateral agreements in the early 1980s.

For agriculture, despite the apparent inability of export-oriented interests to become as
well organized in their own behalf as the import-competing interests, and despite the grueling

congressional NAFTA debate and the associated bargaining and concessions, the original
provisions of NAFFA that eliminate trade barriers between Mexico and the United States over

the long run remain largely intact. A careful examination also suggests that many of the
concessions and assurances offered to U.S. agricultural interest groups to secure votes for the
implementing legislation weaken the original NAFTA provisions less than might be thought even
in the short run. Other acknowledged concessions to the interest groups are also relatively minor.

This said, in terms of entrenched domestic U.S. agricultural programs, the notion that a

trade agreement can serve as an avenue to reform fared poorly under NAFTA. Among the
protected commodities, daiiy and cotton came to support the agreement only when strong rules
of origin were adopted and the absence of any threat to their domestic markets became apparent.

66

They conceded nothing generally about the protection they receive. Peanut producers fought hard

against the agreenient and battled in the end br several concessions to sustain their protection.
More egregious than (lie dairy and peanut provisions of the agreement, among its trade-

distorting effects NAITA initially created a common sugar market between Mexico and the
United States Ironi which both Mexican and U.S producers were potentially going to beneFit at
the expense oF consumers and excluded producers. T he subsequent concessions to (3.5. sugar
interests, which helped deliver over a dozen congressional votes, exacerbated the initial distortion

by essentially stealing from the Mexican producers some of their potential market opportunity

while enhancing the potential demand facing U.S. producers. It was an impressive show of
strcngth by the U.S. sugar industry. The concessions obtained gutted the agreement for freer
bilateral trade, albeit within a protected common market, for at least the next IS years. They also
raise the question of whether the agreement to allow unrestricted trade in sugar between Mexico

and the United States after 15 years is ultimately credible.

The differences in the NAFFA outcomes between Mexico and Canada are also telling.
The U.S. producer groups were most successful with respect to Mexico, which has agreed to
open itself to much more competition from U.S. agricultural products than has the United States
to competition from Mexican products. Reducing trade harriers is good policy for Mexico overall
hut Mexican agricultural producer groups that might have supported a stronger agreement in terms

oF their own export opportunities had limited ability to influence the negotiations. Nor was there

much coumervailing power to the pressure of import-protected U.S. agricultural producers for
concessions. 'l'o insure NJAFTA's approval, the (3.8. government succeeded in pressing these
concessions on the Mexican government.

67

It remains unknown whether Mexico will be able to ftlfihl its NAFTA commitments on
agriculture--say, by facilitating trade liberalization with adequate transfer payments to its affected

producers as part of the reform of its domestic agricultural policy. Particularly in light of the
political rebellion launched in the southern state of Chiapas on the day NAFTA went into affect,

and the subsequent assassination of the presidential candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI) in March 1994, it also remains possible that Mexico will reverse its domestic policies

and increase production-stimulating support to its agricultural producers. No limits were set on

domestic support levels under NAFTA and such a policy reversal could dampen U.S. export
prospects compared to the expectations of some producer groups.

With Canada, the story is different and, as of this writing, equally unresolved.
Throughout the NAFTA process, Canadian agricultural producers were more effective in
defending their established protection than the Mexican producers. Canada's participation in the

agreement was largely ignored in the United States except by a few special interests. But to
insure passage of the NAFTA implementing legislation, the Clinton administration made unilateral

promises to several U.S. agricultural commodity groups about their perceived grievances with
Canada. Thus, one outcome of the process is that it set the stage for potentially nasty disputes
between the United States and Canada over wheat, peanut butter, sugar-containing products and,

with tariffication under GAiT, dairy and poultry products.

Given the focus on Mexico in the public NAFFA debate, the unresolved issues with
Canada are a surprising outcome. Their resolution will test the commitment of the Clinton and

future administrations to a more open trade regime. Subsequent to NAFTA's enactment, the
United States offered to settle the agricultural trade disputes with Canada by adopting bilateral

free trade in agricultural products. Should this offer be refused, as is likely, additional trade
68

barriers may arise as the United States imposes trade restrictions on wheat and other products.

Post-NAFTA agricultural trade between the United States and Canada could end up more laded
with barriers than before.

On a somewhat different theme, the bargaining power agricultural groups held toward the
end of the NAFFA debate is striking. The agricultural interest groups positioned themselves to

bargain for concessions because they sought modifications of specific provisions but did not
explicitly oppose the entire agreement. The concerns of the Florida coalition, sugar, peanuts
or wheat mattered to the outcome of close to 30 congressional votes.

The question that arises is why other groups didn't do more to put themselves in such
a position. The concessions made to agriculture toward the end of the debate were not the only

concessions offered by the Clinton administration. One wonders, for example, why the AFLCO didn't approach the president with concerns about specific industries and to seek additional

transition-period protection in these areas in exchange for delivering their support for the
agreement. One can imagine a veiy different coalition having been put together to pass the

implementing legislation in such circumstances.

Agricultural interests could have found

themselves irrelevant to the congressional vote and the sugar and wheat producers sent away to

make their case in another context. Curiously, one doubts these parties to last-minute
concessions were the intended beneficiaries of organized labor's political efforts.

Consideration of possible alternative coalitions in support of NAFTA also raises the

question of whether one-by-one bilateral negotiations offer any realistic hope for reducing
agricultural or other trade barriers on an extensive (eventually global) basis. Though free trade
zones are proliferating, the lesson from NAFTA seems discouraging. For each agreement one

can imagine the various specific interest groups lining up in different arrays. Favoring trade
69

liberalization when it is to their advantage, these interest groups lobby equally strongly for
benefits that come from introducing policy distortions rather than removing them. On these
shifting sands, negotiating multiple free trade agreements and building coalitions in their support

looks like it leads to dnidgerous trench warfare. For agriculture, in particular, attaining freer

trade with Mexico under NAFTA accomplished only a tiny percentage of the goals sought
eventually through GAIT. Progress to be sure, but at such a rate as perhaps to be negligible
unless NAFTA becomes the type of hole in the dike that protectionist agricultural interests claim

to have feared but seem so far to have avoided.
