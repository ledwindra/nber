Exchange Rate Regimes and the Extensive Margin of Trade
Paul R. Bergin and Ching-Yi Lin
NBER Working Paper No. 14126
June 2008
JEL No. F4
ABSTRACT
This paper finds that currency unions and direct exchange rate pegs raise trade through distinct channels.
Panel data analysis of the period 1973-2000 indicates that currency unions have raised trade predominantly
at the extensive margin, the entry of new firms or products. In contrast, direct pegs have worked almost
entirely at the intensive margin, increased trade of existing products. A stochastic general equilibrium
model is developed to understand this result, featuring price stickiness and firm entry under uncertainty.
Because both regimes tend to reliably provide exchange rate stability over the horizon of a year or
so, which is the horizon of price setting, they both lead to lower export prices and greater demand
for exports. But because currency unions historically are more durable over a longer horizon than
pegs, they encourage firms to make the longer-term investment needed to enter a new market. The model
predicts that when exchange rate uncertainty is completely and permanently eliminated, all of the
adjustment in trade should occur at the extensive margin.

Introduction

A primary rationale given by many countries adopting regimes of exchange rate stabilization,
be it a peg or a full currency union, is the goal of promoting more international trade. Despite a
long literature failing to show a robust linkage between exchange rate variance and trade, Rose
(2000) stimulated a great deal of interest by finding that the adoption of a currency union
historically has tended to raise bilateral trade by a large amount.1 Subsequent literature
generally has supported the statistical significance, if not the magnitude of this result.2 In
addition, Klein and Shambaugh (2006) find that adopting a direct peg, in which a country fixes
its exchange rate to a particular trading partner, also has a significant effect to raise bilateral
trade.
This paper studies the effect of exchange rate regimes on bilateral trade by
decomposing trade into its extensive and intensive margins, where the extensive margin is an
increase in the number of firms or products, and the intensive margin is a rise in the value of
trade by existing firms or products. Recent research in trade theory has emphasized this
distinction, as it has implications for the welfare gains of trade and resource allocation. The
empirical section of this paper conducts panel gravity regressions, analogous to those of Rose
(2000) and Klein and Shambaugh (2006), but it considers three distinct independent variables:
bilateral trade flows, the extensive margin of bilateral trade, and the intensive margin. The
extensive and intensive margins are measured using the NBER/UN data base prepared by
Robert Feenstra and Robert Lipsey, which records bilateral trade flows at a 4-digit
disaggregated goods level. This data set covers the years 1962-2000, so it does not include the

recent experience of the European Monetary Union. Consequently the results for currency
unions, like those in Rose (2000), are based on countries that are mainly small or poor, so
implications are not directly applicable to EMU members. The exchange rate regime
classifications used are from Klein and Shambaugh (2007).
The empirical work first confirms two stylized facts from previous work: both
currency unions and direct pegs raise trade flows, and the effect is somewhat larger for
currency unions than for pegs. Of greater novelty are two additional stylized facts that are
uncovered. Currency unions have a large and statistically significant effect at the extensive
margin, but a small and insignificant effect at the intensive margin. In contrast, direct pegs
exhibit just the opposite pattern: a small and insignificant effect at the extensive margin, but a
significant effect at the intensive margin. Our overall empirical conclusion, then, is that while
currency unions and direct pegs both raise trade flows, they appear to work through distinct
channels. These findings offer some new insight into the role of exchange rate regimes in
facilitating trade, which are useful in discriminating among alternative theories.3
The theoretical section of this paper develops a potential explanation for these
empirical findings. It builds upon developments in international macroeconomics, in modeling
how exchange rate uncertainty affects the price-setting of firms under price stickiness. But it
also utilizes some recent developments in trade theory, which model firm entry decisions in the
face of fixed costs.4 As a result, this paper is among the very first to model how exchange rate

3

Related to this work, Baldwin and Di Nino (2006), Bergin and Glick (2007), and Kehoe and Ruhl
(2002) find in studies of the specific case of the euro area that there appears to be a significant effect on
the extensive margin. This study agrees with this point, though for a different set of countries, and it goes
on to find a contrasting result for direct pegs.

model multi-product firms, as done in Bernard et al. (2006).

uncertainty affects firm entry decisions under sticky prices.5 The model is a stochastic general
equilibrium monetary model with two symmetric countries. It specifies that prices must be set
before the monetary shocks driving exchange rates are known, and that the entry decision must
be made a period prior to this. Motivated by empirical evidence, we assume that while both
pegs and currency unions are credible in eliminating exchange rate volatility over the horizon
that prices are pre-set, only a currency union is credible for the longer horizon over which entry
decisions must be determined.
As a result, both regimes lower the riskiness of foreign sales when the firm is setting
price, which results in lower export prices and higher export sales, consistent with our first
empirical fact. However, the existence of a peg when a firm is deciding on entry is not very
informative about the exchange rate behavior in the later period when export sales take place.
As a result, only the currency union encourages more entry relative to a freely floating
exchange rate regime. This is consistent with the last two of our empirical facts above. In fact,
the model predicts that 100 percent of the rise in trade volume when a currency union
eliminates exchange rate uncertainty comes at the extensive margin, with no impact on the
intensive margin. This is somewhat surprising, since one might expect the risk premium in
prices, used by firms to hedge against exchange rate uncertainty in price setting, could also

5

This project differs from other prominent research in the field. Ghironi and Melitz (2005) show how to
combine recent developments in trade theory with a macroeconomic model. But it focuses on the dynamic
response to real shocks; it did not include money, nominal exchange rates, nor the nominal rigidities
needed to study the real effects of exchange rate regimes. Naknoi (2007) is the first to have a monetary
model with endogenous tradability and nominal stickiness. However, it studies an entirely different issue,
trying to explain the source of exchange rate variability, rather than how exchange rate risk affects entry
decisions. Kumhof, Laxton, and Naknoi (2007) is the first to integrates trade theory and trade frictions
into a monetary model which is usable for policy analysis, doing so in a very rich dynamic setting.
However, this paper again studies a different issue than the present project, as it focuses on how exchange
rate movements induce costly adjustments in trade flows, where the real costs of adjustment impose a
welfare loss; it does not study the issue of special interest here, regarding how exchange rate variability
has level effects on the mean level of trade.

help hedge against the effects of risk on the entry decision. But this is not the case. Finally, the
fact that currency unions induce a larger entry of new varieties interacts with love for variety in
preferences to stimulate more expenditure on exported goods than under a peg, which results in
a larger impact of currency unions on overall trade flows. This is consistent with the second of
our four empirical facts.
In related work, Baldwin et al. (2005) proposes a model of how a reduction in exchange
rate uncertainty under a currency union stimulates the extensive margin. Our paper differs in
that it models the effect of uncertainty from first principles, tracing how it affects price setting
and entry decisions.6 In addition, our model is able to distinguish between the effects of
reducing exchange rate uncertainty through direct pegs versus currency unions.

Empirical Analysis

The study uses a panel dataset which covers 148 countries’ bilateral exports at an annual
frequency from 1973 to 2000. Our range of counties and the end date of our sample are
determined by the availability of the disaggregated trade data needed for us to measure the
extensive margin. These data come from the NBER-UN World Trade Data set, developed by
Rob Feenstra and Robert Lipsey, documented in Feenstra et al. (2005). This data set computes
annual bilateral trade flows at the four-digit Standard International Trade Classification, by
performing a series of adjustments on UN trade data7. For data on exchange rate regime
classifications, we use the classifications in Klein and Shambaugh (2006, 2007), hereafter

6

In contrast, Baldwin et al. (2005) introduces exchange rate uncertainty in a more ad hoc manner by
introducing the variance of exchange rates as a term in a firm loss function. Further, he does not study
how uncertainty affects trade and entry by affecting price-setting decisions.
7
It is noted that the data purchased from the UN for 1984-2000 only had values in excess of $100,000, for
each bilateral flow. To be consistent, the cutoff of exports in this study is set as $100,000, which implies
that goods are considered nontradable if an export value of the category is less than $100,000.

referred to as KS. Although the bilateral trade data starts earlier than 1973 (in 1962), we
follow KS in focusing on the post Bretton Woods period. As they note, the pegs in Bretton
Woods were part of a multilateral system with extensive capital controls, and so are quite
different from more contemporary unilateral pegs. Nonetheless, we will show in supplementary
tables that our results are quite robust to a longer sample range. Geographic data needed for our
regressions come from the data set of Andrew Rose (Rose, 2004).
The definition of a peg in this data set requires that the bilateral exchange rate stays
within a 2% band at the end of each month the entire year, and direct peg occurs when it can be
identified in addition that one country pegs to a particular base country. In any one year about
50% of the countries in the sample are involved in a peg with some other country. Many of
these are a developing country pegging to an industrialized one. There is a great deal of regime
switching among these countries. Klein and Shambaugh (2007) note that 44% of pegs last for
only one year. Interestingly, there is also a high rate of regime change among floats; 36 percent
of floats spells also last for only one year.
The definition of a currency union is a strict one, as in Rose (2000), that currencies
trade at a 1 to 1 rate. As noted in KS, the currency unions usually involve countries that are
small or poor. In our sample there are 65 country pairs that show a currency union
relationship.8 These relationships are much more stable than pegs, in that only 9 of the 65
country pairs exhibited a change in regime during the entire 28 year sample.
Following Hummels and Klenow (2005), the extensive margin is measured in a manner
consistent with consumer price theory by adapting the methodology in Feenstra (1994). The
extensive margin of exports from country j to country m, denoted byEM mj, is defined as

The list of countries involved in these pairs are: Australia, Bangladesh, Benin, Burkina Faso, Central
African Republic, Chad, Congo, Cote Divoire, Dominican Republic, Gabon, Guatemala, Guinea Bissau,
India, Ireland, Kiribati, Liberia, Madagascar, Mauritania, Niger, Panama, Senegal, Togo, U.K., USA.

where X mW,i is the export values from the world to country j of product category I, I mj is the set
of observable categories in which country j has positive exports to country m, and X mW is the
aggregate value of world exports to country m. The extensive margin is a weighted count of
country j’s categories relative to all categories exported to country m, where the categories are
weighted by their importance in world’s exports to country m.
The corresponding intensive margin of exports from country j to country m, denoted by
IM mj , is defined as
IM mj =

∑ i∈I j X mW,i

(2)

where X mj is the total export value from country j to country m. The intensive margin is
measured as j’s export value relative to the weighted categories in which country j exports to
country m. Therefore, multiplying the intensive margin by the extensive margin produces
country j’s share of world exports to country m, denoted by EXSharemj ,
EXSharemj =

The categories of goods exported might differ across exporters and change over time.
With the same level of share of world exports to country m at time t, the measurement implies
that country j would have a higher extensive margin measure if it exports many different
categories of products to country m, whereas, it would have a higher intensive margin if
country j only export a few categories to country m.

6

Separate panel regressions are run by regressing the extensive margin, the intensive
margin, and the exporter’s total share on the exchange rate regime variables, as well as the
standard set of gravity model variables. The benchmark regressions take the form:

Y jm ,t = β 0 + β1CU jm ,t + β 2 Peg jm ,t + β 3 IdPeg jm ,t + β 4 ex var jm ,t + λ X jm ,t + γ F jm + φ t
+κ exp + ωimp + ε jm ,t

(4)

The model is estimated based on the ordinary least squares with robust standard errors
clustered in export pair level, where j is the exporter and m is the importer. The dependent
variables ( Y jm ,t ) will be either the logarithm of country j’s extensive margin of exports to
country m, the logarithm of country j’s intensive margin, or the logarithm of share of world
exports. Regressors include dummies for the exchange rate regime: CU jm ,t for a currency
union, Peg jm ,t for and direct peg, and IdPeg jm ,t for an indirect peg. The regressor ex var jm ,t is
a measure of volatility of the nominal exchange rate between countries j and m, which is the
standard deviation of the first difference of the logarithm of the monthly exchange rate
between the two countries. Next, X jm ,t is a set of variables that vary over time, which includes
the logarithm of real GDP per capita of exporter j relative to real GDP per capita of all
countries who export to importer m, logarithm of exporter j’s population relative to real GDP
per capita of all countries who export to importer m, a dummy variable indicating whether the
two countries had a free trade agreement at time t, and a dummy variable for pairs currently in
colonial relationship. F jm is a set of variables that do not vary over time, such as the logarithm
of distance between country j and m, a common language dummy, a land border dummy, and a
dummy for pairs ever in colonial relationship. Also included is a time effect, t, to control for
time-specific factors such as global shocks or business cycles.

7

To avoid omitting variables that may affect bilateral trade, two vectors of dummy
variables, exp and imp, are included indicating exporter and importer fixed effects. As
Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) proposed, country effects are included as controls for
multilateral resistance. We decided to use separate country fixed effects for each country as
exporter and importer, because in contrast with the related literature on trade flows, our
dependent variable specifies the direction of trade.9
Initial results are reported in Table 1, covering the sample with country fixed effects from
1973 to 2000. Currency union has a highly statically significant effect to raise both overall
exports and the extensive margin of exports, but an insignificant (small negative) effect at the
intensive margin. In contrast, a direct peg has a significant effect to raise overall trade and the
intensive margin, but the effect at the extensive margin is insignificant. The coefficients for
currency union imply that a currency union would raise the export share by 122% because of a
149% increase in the extensive margin.10 So all of the rise in trade comes at the extensive
margin. A peg can increase export share by 26%, which comes from 25% increase in the
intensive margin of exports. So virtually all of the rise in trade comes at the intensive margin.
In summary, there are four facts observed for this data set. First, both exchange rate regimes
raise bilateral trade, but second, currency unions have a larger effect. Third, currency unions
work at the extensive margin, while fourth, direct pegs work at the intensive margin.

9

Country-pair fixed effects could be useful if trade resistance is bilateral rather than multilateral in nature.
But we do not implement this in the estimation, as it would eliminate cross-sectional variation in the
panel and leaving only time-series variation. Country pairs that have no regime switch for the entire
sample period do not yield information in the estimate. In the study of the impacts of currency union, we
can even less afford to sacrifice cross-sectional information. There are 65 country pairs ever had a
currency union, but only 9 of them had a regime switch in the sample period.
10
The export share is 2.22 times higher (122%) because exp(0.796) = 2.22; the extensive margin is 2.49
times higher (149%) because exp(0.913) = 2.49.
8

Regarding other coefficients, exchange rate volatility does not have a statistically
significant effect on overall trade, echoing results in other studies. The coefficients on indirect
peg are negative, which is somewhat surprising. The standard gravity variables are generally
significant and of the expected sign.
Anderson and van Wincoop (2004) note that multilateral resistance could change over
time, indicating that the country fixed effects used in the previous regression are not sufficient
controls. Table 2 reports results when we use country-year fixed effects, where separate
country fixed effects are included for each year in the panel regression. We will follow Klein
and Shambaugh (2006) in using this specification as our benchmark result. Results are very
similar to those reported above, where currency union has a significant effect to raise overall
trade and the extensive margin, and direct pegs have significant effects on overall trade and the
intensive margin. However, the magnitude of currency union impacts are somewhat smaller.
Translating coefficients, a currency union raises the overall trade share by 84%, raises the
extensive margin 84% and raises the intensive margin 0%. A direct peg raises overall trade
share by 25%, the extensive margin by 0%, and the intensive margin by 25%. Again we see
that while both exchange rate regimes raise overall trade, they are entirely distinct in terms of
the margins of trade through which they work.
Next, consider robustness of results to controlling for endogeneity with instrumental
variables estimation. One might be concerned that exchange rate regimes could respond to an
anticipated change in bilateral trade, rather than bilateral trade responding to a change in the
exchange rate regime. The instrumental variable used here is the same as in Klein and
Shambaugh (2006), the percentage of countries in country j’s region that are directly pegged
with country i for a given pair of country i and j. The instrument predicts whether a country

9

pegs its currency, and thereby can indirectly affect trade, but it will have no direct impact on
trade, itself. Table 3 shows that results are very similar to those reported above. In particular,
the pattern of significance for currency unions and pegs is unchanged. The magnitude of the
currency union coefficient in Table 3 is very close to that from Table 1, and the direct peg
coefficient is about twice as large as in Table 1.
Finally, Table 4 shows results for estimating over the date range prior to Bretton
Woods, 1962-2000. Results again are very similar. The only exception being that in the case of
IV estimation, the direct peg loses its significance on the overall export share.

Theoretical Analysis

The purpose of this section is to study theoretically the effect of exchange rate uncertainty on
firms’ decisions to enter export markets. We use a stochastic general equilibrium model of two
symmetric countries with price stickiness and fixed costs of entry into both domestic and
export markets. Uncertainty comes from monetary shocks in both countries, and we assume
balanced trade.11 To permit a closed form solution for the number of firms entering under
uncertainty, the model will abstract from firm heterogeneity; however, the concluding section
will conjecture on heterogeneity’s likely implications for the paper’s results. A key element in
this analysis will be prices that need to be preset before firms observe the shocks determining
exchange rates. Given uncertain valuation of profits from foreign sales, and assuming
preferences where consumption and leisure are substitutes, firms will hedge against risk by
setting higher prices on exported goods. This risk premium in prices has implications similar to

11

All our results hold also under the alternative assumption of complete asset markets, which replaces the
balanced trade condition with the following risk sharing condition: u ct u ' ct = Et P * t Pt . This implies
that our results are robust to including assets usable for exchange rate hedging.

iceberg trade costs in more standard trade models. Higher export prices will discourage
demand for traded goods and reduce the volume of trade. This effect applies equally to all
exchange rate regimes that lower exchange rate volatility, both currency union and direct peg
alike. To distinguish between these two regimes, we draw on the empirical observation that
about half of new pegs do not survive more than one year, whereas currency unions tend to last
many years. We model the effect this has on entry decisions, by assuming that the fixed cost
must be paid earlier than price setting, when there is still uncertainty about the exchange rate
regime that will prevail when sales take place.
For the sake of clarity in describing the sequence of events and information sets, we
specify a three period model. The final period (t2) is when production and all sales take place.
This is the period where the shocks are revealed, which determine the equilibrium values of the
exchange rate, wages, and production. In the period previous (t1), firms must choose their
prices for domestic and foreign sales, based upon their expectations for shocks and equilibrium
values the subsequent period. The firms’ decision to enter a market must be made in the period
previous to this (t0), based upon their expectations conditional on information in this period.
We assume that currency unions adopted in period t0 can be expected to continue to exist in
periods t1 and t2. By contrast, we assume that direct pegs adopted in period t0 last through
period t1, but then are expected to fail by the time period t2 begins. Likewise, direct pegs
adopted in period t1 are expected to last to the end of period t2. To permit an analytical
solution, we assume firm expectations assign a zero probability to a direct peg adoption exante.12

12

Given that Klein and Shambaugh (2007) show that a new peg has a 44% chance of failing after its first
year, a better assumption would be to model agent expectations for a corresponding probability
distribution of a peg and float in year t2. But this assumption proved intractable for an analytical solution
comparing across regimes.
11

While we use a three-period characterization of the model for clarity, an equivalent
characterization (under i.i.d. shocks) that more naturally maps into our empirical study would
be as an infinite horizon of annual observations. Prices are chosen at the beginning of each
year, for sales later that same year, and entry decisions are made one year ahead of time. Pegs
adopted at the beginning of the year are expected to last until the end of the year, but not until
the next year. In this characterization, period t2 corresponds to the end of the year, t1 to the
beginning of the year, and t0 to the end of the previous year.
In the notation below, the dating convention will be to date variables by the period in
which they are determined.

3.1 Households
There is a continuum of identical households in each of the two countries, designated
home and foreign, and the population in each country is normalized to one. A representative
household in the home country consumes n H varieties of home goods, and n F varieties of
goods exported from the foreign country. He supplies labor, receives profits from owning an
equal proportion of domestic firms, and holds home money through a cash-in-advance
constraint. The representative household of the Home country maximizes the expectation of
utility
U ( Ct2 , lt2 )

(5)

in period 2, where C is aggregate consumption, l is leisure, and where it is assumed that
consumption and leisure are substitutes. Aggregate consumption is defined as a nested CES
aggregator, with a potentially distinct elasticity between home and foreign goods aggregates
( φ ), and among varieties from a given country ( μ ).

love for variety, in that γ -1 represents the marginal utility gain from spreading a given amount

2.2 Firms’ Behavior
Production technology is assumed to be linear in labor:

14

yHt2 ( i ) = ALHt2 ,

(15)

where A represents productivity, which is assumed deterministic and homogeneous across
firms. Firms pay an equilibrium wage rate W for each unit of labor. To produce for domestic
sale, firms must also pay a fixed cost, F, in domestic labor units. To export, firms pay an
iceberg cost, τ , as well as committing to pay a fixed cost, F * , which is in units of domestic
labor. Firms must pre-commit to paying both types of fixed costs in period t0. It is assumed that
the fixed cost of entering the domestic market is lower than that of entering the export market
(F<F*), due to the additional costs of language, product standards, legal barriers, and
transactions costs associated with currency conversion.
Firms must set prices in the currency of the buyer in period t1 for sales in period t2,
before knowing the realization of monetary shocks. Each firm would maximize the expected
market value of total nominal profits from domestic and exported markets. Since households
are the owners of firms, uncertain profits across states are discounted using the marginal utility
of consumption.
A home firm’s problem is to maximize its expected profits:

3.3 Equilibrium Nominal Exchange Rate Determination
The equilibrium nominal exchange rate can be derived explicitly, under the assumption of
a fully symmetric structure. Foreign exchange market clearing requires that excess supply of
the two currencies must be zero in equilibrium. Under the assumption of balanced trade, equate
the value of imports to the value of export revenue:
*
PFt1 C Ft 2 − st 2 PHt* 1 C Ht
=0 .
2

(24)

Assume full symmetry across countries, so PFt = PHt* and Pt = Pt * . Substituting the demand
1

1

1

1

function of traded goods, we can solve
st 2 =

M t2

(25)

M t*2

The equilibrium nominal exchange rate is equal to the ratio of money supplies. Clearly, this is
a very simple exchange rate equation, but it captures the relationship between nominal
exchange rate and fundamentals directly.
In addition, it’s assumed that the Home and Foreign money supplies, M and M * , are both
log-normally distributed, which is defined by
log ( M ) = m + ε

(26)

where m is a constant and ε is an i.i.d random variable with a normal distribution, N ( 0,σ m2 ) .
This implies,
1
⎛
⎞
Et1 ( M t 2 ) = exp ⎜ m + σ m2 ⎟
2
⎝
⎠

(27)

The distribution of M and M * is jointly symmetric, with a correlation that equals 1 under a
peg and a currency union, and a correlation that equals zero under pure float. This implies that

17

*

m = m and σ m2 = σ m*2 = σ 2 , thus the uncertainty of the nominal exchange rate under a pure float

comes from the randomly distributed disturbance in the money supply, σ 2 ,
⎛ Mt
Et1 ( st 2 ) = Et1 ⎜ *2
⎜ Mt
⎝ 2

⎞

⎟⎟ = exp (σ )
⎠

(28)

3.4 Effects of Exchange Rate Regimes on Price Setting
The firm price setting behavior in this model is identical to that developed in Bacchetta
and van Wincoop (2000). Using equations (10) and (25) to substitute for the endogenous wage
and exchange rate in the price-setting equations (19) and (20):
⎛ μ ⎞ Pt1 Et1 ⎡⎣u l t 2 M t 2 ⎤⎦
p Ht1 ( i ) = ⎜
⎟
⎝ μ − 1 ⎠ A E t1 ⎡⎣u c t 2 M t 2 ⎤⎦

(29)

E t1 ⎡⎣u l t 2 M t*2 ⎤⎦
⎛ μ ⎞ Pt1
*
p Ht
i
=
(
)
⎜
⎟
1
⎝ μ − 1 ⎠ A (1 − τ ) E t1 ⎡⎣u ct 2 M t 2 ⎤⎦

(30)

Consider first the case of a floating exchange rate, where the money supplies of the two
countries move independently. Under the assumption of substitutability between consumption
and leisure, it must be that Et ⎡⎣u l t M t ⎤⎦ < Et ⎡⎣u l t M * t ⎤⎦ . Intuitively, a shock raising home
1

2

2

1

2

2

money supply will raise home consumption but not foreign consumption, because the cash in
advance constraint for home money involves only home consumption. Because home
consumption includes both home and foreign goods, this will lower both home and foreign
labor. Given that consumption and leisure are substitutes, the rise in home consumption will
help offset the rise in the marginal utility of leisure when it is due to a home money rise. This is
not true for a rise in foreign money, which lowers home leisure but does not raise home
consumption. As a result, the home marginal utility of leisure has a smaller covariance with

18

home money than it does with foreign money, and Et ⎡⎣u l t M t ⎤⎦ < Et ⎡⎣u l t M * t ⎤⎦ . Another way to
1

2

2

1

2

2

view this is that the rise in wage rate needed to clear the money market is higher for a foreign
money shock than a home money shock, so that the expected costs of production rise more for
a foreign money shock. The higher price represents a risk premium associated with sales
abroad. This, along with the fact that exporters must pay the iceberg trade cost, ensures that
export prices are higher than domestic goods prices. Of course, if we were to assume instead
that consumption and leisure were not substitutes, this result would change. See the appendix
of Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2000) for a proof of this point.
Next consider the case where exchange rates are fixed, which requires that home and
foreign money supplies are perfectly correlated. This condition is true for both direct pegs and
currency unions. Now a rise in money supply (home and foreign together) will always raise
home consumption along with the fall in leisure. So Et ⎡⎣u l t M t ⎤⎦ = Et ⎡⎣u l t M * t ⎤⎦ , and there is no
1

2

2

1

2

2

risk premium raising export prices over domestic prices; export prices will be higher only due
to iceberg trade costs.
Given that shocks are i.i.d. and prices are preset, then conditional on knowledge of the
exchange rate regime, prices will not be time-varying. Let us indicate these constant prices
with over-bars, and summarize the results above with the following statement:
p H ,CU ( i )
p H ,CU ( i )

p H , Peg ( i )
*

*

=

p H , Peg ( i )

p H , float ( i )
*

<

p H , float ( i ) .

(31)

3.5 Effects of Exchange Rate Regimes on Number of Firms
We next study the implications of the entry conditions (22) and (23) under alternative
exchange rate regimes. Consider first a currency union. In this case, it is known already in

19

period t0 that there will be no exchange rate movements in period t2, so firms expect that prices
set in period t1 will correspond to the result derived above for a fixed exchange rate. Under this
information set, the entry condition (22) then can be written:

n H* ,CU ,t0

(

⎧ 1 ⎛ 1 ⎞ *(φ −1)
*
= ⎨ ⎜ ⎟ P CU Et0 ⎡⎣u ct 2 M t 2 ⎤⎦ p H ,CU ( i )
⎩2 ⎝ μ ⎠

)

1

1−φ

⎫ γ + (1−γ )φ
⎡ Et ⎡u ct Wt ⎤ F * ⎤ ⎬
⎣ 0 ⎣ 2 2⎦ ⎦
⎭

(32)

(See the appendix for the derivation.) The subscript CU indicates a currency union, but for
prices we continue to use the subscript fix, because this term will apply to all cases where
exchange rates are fixed, including a direct peg. The exponent depends on the degree of love of
variety, γ , as well as the aggregate elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods,
φ . If we assume no love for variety ( γ = 1 ), then the exponent takes the value of 1 and

disappears. Under the calibration consistent with Dixit-Stiglitz preferences ( γ =

μ
, where μ
μ −1

is the elasticity of substitution between varieties), this exponent takes the value

( μ − 1) ( μ − φ ) . The corresponding condition for the domestic number of firms is analogous.
It turns out to be very convenient to express the two as a ratio, as several terms common across
the two cancel under symmetry across countries (including some expectations difficult to deal
with, Et ⎡⎣u ct M t ⎤⎦ and Et ⎡⎣u ct Wt ⎤⎦ ) :
0

⎝F ⎠
⎝ F ⎠
⎝
⎠

(33)

This expression can be viewed as the product of two terms, the first being a relative price term,
and the second a relative fixed cost term. The exponent on the price term can take the value of
1 − φ for the case of no love for variety, or the value of ( μ − 1)(1 − φ ) / ( μ − φ ) for the case of

Dixit-Stiglitz preferences, both of which will be negative for values of φ > 1 . In the case of a

20

currency union, the price set by firms is the same in both markets, except for the iceberg cost,
so entry in the export market is lower than domestic entry due only to the presence of iceberg
and fixed trade costs.
Consider next the case of a float. As derived in the appendix,

n,*float ,t0

(

⎧ 1 ⎛ 1 ⎞ *(φ −1)
*
= ⎨ ⎜ ⎟ P float Et 0 ⎡⎣u ct 2 M t2 ⎤⎦ p H , float ( i )

1−φ

⎫ γ + (1−γ )φ
⎡ Et ⎡u ct Wt ⎤ F * ⎤ ⎬
⎣ 0 ⎣ 2 2⎦ ⎦
⎭

(34)

And taking a ratio to the analogous entry of home firms into the domestic market:
1−φ

n

*
H , float ,t 0

n H , float ,t 0

⎛ p*

⎜

⎜
⎟
⎜ p H , float ( i ) ⎟
⎝ F ⎠
⎝
⎠

(35)

As seen above, there is a large gap between export and domestic price setting under a float in
p H , float ( i )
*

this model

p H , float ( i )

p H ,CU ( i )
*

>

p H ,CU ( i )

=

1
. This implies a float will discourage entry in the export
1−τ

market relative to domestic entry.
Finally, we consider the case of a direct peg. Because firms expect a peg adopted in
period t0 to collapse by period t2, the expectation in period t0 for prices in t1 are the same prices
as under a float. Hence the number of firms determined in period t0 will be the same as under a
float:

n H* , peg ,t0

n

and

*
H , peg ,t 0

n H , peg ,t0

(

⎧ 1 ⎛ 1 ⎞ *(φ −1)

(37)

As a result we can conclude the following relationship of entry among regimes under our

assumptions:

>

n H* , peg ,t0
n H , peg ,t0

=

n H* , float ,t0
n H , float ,t0

for φ > 1 and γ ≤ φ (φ − 1) .

3.6 Implications for Export Share, and the Extensive and Intensive Margins.
Finally, we are ready to decompose the effects of exchange rate regimes into extensive
and intensive margins. As this is a two-country model, whereas the data set is from a multicountry setting, we must work a bit to construct theoretical measures of the trade margins as
close as possible to those in the empirical work. The extensive margin in the empirical section
scales the number of products traded between two countries by the trade in products with all
countries; in our two-country world, we will scale the number of firms traded by the number of
all firms that sell domestically. This scaling, similar in spirit, allows us to use the relative
extensive margin measure derived in the section above due to symmetry:
EM ≡

*
n Ht
0
*
n Ft
0

=

*
n Ht
0

n Ht0

.

(38)

In keeping with this measure of the extensive margin, we will measure the export share as the
ratio of the value of home exports to the foreign market divided by the value of domestic sales
in the foreign market. Under symmetry:
−φ

EXShare =

*
PHt* 1 C Ht

(39)

This implies the appropriate measure of the intensive margin, sales per firm, also be
represented relative to domestic market:
*
⎛ PHt* C Ht

⎜ n Ht

First, we wish to show that the export share rises for a peg and currency union
compared to a float, but that the effect is larger for a currency union. First for a currency union:

We know from the discussion of price setting that the second term is greater than unity,
reflecting the fact that under a float export prices are higher than domestic prices due to risk,
while under a currency union this is not true. Lower export prices will raise export revenues
provided demand is elastic. And we know from the discussion of extensive margins that the
first term is greater than unity, provided there is love for variety. So we have two reasons why
trade is higher under a currency union: lower export prices relative to domestic prices, and love
of variety.
For a direct peg, firm-level price setting is the same as a currency union, while the
number of firms is the same as under a float:
EXShare peg
EXShare float

⎛ n H* , float ,t1 n H , float ,t1

The rise in trade under a currency union is greater than under a direct peg, by a factor
proportional to the rise in the extensive margin, with the proportionality depending on love for
variety.
Next, decompose the rise in export share into extensive and intensive margins. Using
conditions (33) and (35) with (41):
EXShareCU ⎛ EM CU
=⎜
EXShare float ⎜⎝ EM float

⎞
⎟⎟
⎠

(1−φ )(1−γ )

(43)
So the percentage rise in export share from float to currency union is equal to the percentage
rise in the extensive margin. That is, 100% of the rise in trade is attributable to the extensive
margin, and none due to the intensive margin. This result is consistent with our empirical
finding. Nonetheless, it is somewhat surprising. Given that firms hedge against exchange rate
risk in price setting with a risk premium raising prices, one might expect this would also help
hedge against the effects of exchange rate risk on the entry decision. But this is not the case.
The story is quite different for a direct peg. Given that the extensive margin is
unchanged from a float to a direct peg, by definition, the rise in export share is all due to the
intensive margin. This again corresponds to our empirical finding.

4.

Conclusion

This paper finds that currency unions and direct pegs raise trade volume through distinct

24

channels. Panel data analysis of the period 1973-2000 indicates that currency unions have
raised trade largely at the extensive margin, the entry of new firms or products. In contrast,
direct pegs have raised trade almost entirely at the intensive margin, increased trade in existing
products. A theoretical model is developed to understand this finding, featuring price
stickiness and firm entry under uncertainty. Because both regimes provide exchange rate
stability over the horizon of price setting, they lead to lower export prices and greater demand
for exports. But because currency unions are more credible at a longer horizon, they encourage
firms to make the longer-term investment needed to enter a new market.
Our model does not rule out the possibility that adopting a currency union could
additionally expand the extensive margin by affecting fixed costs. These could involve
deterministic effects, such as the elimination of currency conversion or other transactions costs,
which would lower the fixed cost F*. In addition, the model could be extended to consider
fixed costs that themselves are affected by exchange rate risk, such as entry into foreign
markets committing to fixed expenditures in foreign labor units in future periods. The fixed
costs term, F*, then becomes stochastic, and its expected value could fall under exchange rate
stabilization, encouraging entry.
This model abstracted from firm heterogeneity, in order to get a closed form solution
under uncertainty for the number of firms. If firms were heterogeneous in terms of their
productivity levels, this likely would work in the opposite direction of explaining the higher
rise in exports under a currency union compared to a direct peg. Since a currency union implies
a larger extensive margin effect, the new entrants would systematically have lower productivity
than incumbent firms. This would lower the average productivity of market participants and
raise the export price index, which would limit the increase in aggregate trade volume.
