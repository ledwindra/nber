    "abstract": "\n\nThe propositions that monetary expansion lowers short-term nominal interest rates (the liquidity effect), and that monetary policy does not have long-run real effects (long-run neutrality), are widely accepted, yet to date the empirical evidence for both is mixed.  We reconsider both propositions simultaneously in a structural VAR context, using a model of the market for bank reserves due to Bernanke and Mihov (forthcoming).  We find little basis for rejecting either the liquidity effect or long-run neutrality.  Our results are robust over the space of admissible model parameter values, and to the use of long-run rather than short-run identifying restrictions.\n\n",
