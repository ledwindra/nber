Does the Consumption of Different Age Groups Move Together?
A New Nonparametric Test of Intergenerational Altruism

ABSTRACT

In recent years Robert Barro's (1974) ingenious model of intergenerational altruism has taken its place among the major theories of
consumption and saving. Despite its policy importance, there have been few
direct tests of the Barro model. This paper presents a new direct test that
is based on a property of the Barro model that, to our knowledge, has not
previously been exploited. This property is that the Euler errors (i.e.,
disturbances in the Euler equations) of altruistically linked members of Barro
extended families (clans) are identical. Under time—separable, homothetic
utility, this equality of Euler errors means that, controlling for clan
preferences about the age distribution of consumptiorr, the percentage changes
over time in consumption of all Barro clan members are equal. With some weak
additional assumptions, this proposition implies that the average percentage
change in household consumption within an age cohort should be the same for
all age cohorts.
Testing the Barro model by comparing average percentage changes in
consumption across age cohorts is particularly advantageous because it is
nonparametric; in determining whether the average consumptions of different
age cohorts move together we place no restrictions on preferences beyond the
assumptions of homotheticity and time separability. In particular, each Barro
clan can have quite different preference parameters.
The new quarterly Consumer Expenditure Surveys (CES) covering 1980
through the- first quarter of 1985 are an excellent data set for determining
whether the consumption of different age groups moves together. The CES
records the consumption of each sample household for-up to four quarters, and
thus can be used to determine the average quarterly percentage change in
consumption of households in a given age group.
The null hypothesis of our test is that cohort differences in the average
percentage change in consumption are due simply to sampling and measurement
error. Alternative hypotheses, suggested by the Life Cycle Model, are that
(1) the percentage changes in the average consumptions of any two cohorts are
more highly correlated the closer in age are the two cohorts, and (2) the
variance in the percentage change in consumption is a monotone function of the
age of the cohort.
The data fail to reject the null hypothesis of equal Euler errors.
Indeed, the results provide fairly strong support for the intergenerational
altruism model as opposed to the Life Cycle Model.

In recent years Robert Barro's (1974) ingenious model of intergenerational altruism has taken its place among the major theories of

consumption and saving. The model, which starts with the simple assumption
that parents care about the welfare of their children, yields the remarkably
strong conclusion that, apart from distorting marginal incentives, deficits

and all other government redistributions between generations have no effect on

the economy. The possibility that deficits, unfunded social security, and
similar policies do not matter has received considerable attention.

Despite its policy importance, there have been few direct tests of the

Barro model. The main difficulty in directly testing the model at the micro
level is the lack of data detailing both the consumption and resources of

altruistically linked households. Direct tests of the model with macro data
are also problematic because they require the aggregation of different Barro
clans (sets of altruistically linked households) each of which may have a
different utility function.

This paper presents a new direct test of the Barro model. The test is
based on a property of the Barro model that, to our knowledge, has not

previously been exploited. This property is that the Euler errors (i.e.,
disturbances in the Euler equations) of altruistically linked members of Barro

extended families (clans) are identical. Assuming utility is homothetic and
time separable, this equality of Euler errors means that, controlling for clan
preferences about the age distribution of consumption, the percentage changes
over time in consumption of all Barro clan members are equal. Intuitively,
since consumption of each clan member is based on overall clan resources, and
not the distribution of resources over clan members, any shocks to the

—4—

resources of specific clan members will be spread across all clan members.

Under the homotheticity and time separability assumptions, spreading shocks
over all clan members means changing the consumption of all members by the
same percentage.

Ideally, one would test this proposition by simply comparing changes in

the consumption of different clan members. Unfortunately, the requisite clan—
specific data is not available; indeed, it may be very difficult to determine

who is and who is not a member of a particular altruistically—linked clan. As
indicated by Kotlikoff (1983) and Bernheim and Bagwell (1985), clans may be
quite large because of current as well as potential future intermarriage.
-

Let

us admit, however, the possibility of multiple clans, but assume for

the moment that each clan has the same age structure. In this case, the
average Euler error within each age cohort will be equal, since the error of
each clan will receive the same weight in each of the cohort averages.

However, the assumption of identical age structures within each clan seems too

strong. A weaker assumption that leads to the same result is a zero
correlation between the age structure of clans and their Euler error; i.e.,
the fact that a clan accounts for a larger than average fraction of households
in an age group does not help predict how its Euler error will differ, on
average, from the average clan Euler error.

Testing the Barro model by comparing average cohort percentage changes in
consumption is particularly advantageous because it is nonparametric; in
determining whether the average consumption of different age cohorts moves
together we place no restrictions on preferences beyond the assumptions.of

homotheticity and time separability. In particular, each Barro clan can have
quite different preferences.

The new quarterly Consumer Expenditure Surveys (CES), which, to date, are
available from the first quarter of 1980 through the first quarter of 1985,

are an excellent data set for determining whether the consumption of different

age groups moves together. The CES records the consumption of each sample
household for up to four quarters, and thus can be used to determine the
average quarterly percentage change in consumption of households in a given
age group.
The null hypothesis of our test is that cohort differences in the average

percentage change in consumption are due simply to sampling and measurement

error. Alternative hypotheses, suggested by the Life Cycle Model, are that
(1) the percentage changes in average consumptions of any two cohorts are more

highly correlated the closer in age are the two cohorts, and (2) the variance
in the percentage change in consumption is a monotone function of the age of
the cohort.

The data fail to reject the null hypothesis of equal Euler errors in
favor of the alternative hypotheses for our definition of total consumption.

Indeed, the results provide fairly strong support for the intergenerational
altruism model as opposed to the Life Cycle Model.

The paper proceeds in the next section by reviewing briefly the empirical

literature bearing on the Barro hypothesis. Section III presents the Barro
model and develops the proposition that Euler errors are equal for all clan
members. Section IV. derives a statistical model to test this proposition.

Section V describes the data. Section VI contains the empirical results, and
Section VII concludes the paper with some suggestions for additional research.

Section II. Empirical Research Bearing on the Barro Hviothesis
The largest body of empirical literature bearing on the Barro hypothesis
relates the consumption time series to the time series of unfunded social

security. Chief among these studies are those of Feldstein (1974), Barro
(1977), Darby (1977), and Leimer and Lesnoy (1981). Studies relating the
consumption time series to other aspects of fiscal policy include Feldstein

(1982), Kormendi (1983), and Aschauer (1985). The results of this body of
research can be summarized with one word, ambiguous. Even were the results
all in agreement, it would be difficult to know precisely what had been
learned; as pointed out by Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1983) and Williamson and
Jones (1983), if the Life Cycle model is taken as the null hypothesis in these
studies, the models are misspecified because of the inability to aggregate the

behavior of different age groups. The Auerbach—Kotlikoff paper shows that the
regression procedures would reject the Life Cycle Model even using data taken

from a pure Life Cycle economy. An alternative view of these regressions is
that the Barro model is the null hypothesis. But in this case the regressions
also seem to be misspecified both because of aggregation and because they
ignore the government's intertemporal budget constraint.

A different body of literature that is relevant to the Barro model as
well as other neoclassical models are the Euler equation studies of Hall
(1978), Hall and Mishkin (1982), Flavin (1981), Shapiro (1984), Zeldes (1985),

Mankiw, Rotemberg, and Summers (1982), Lawrence (1983), Altonji and Siow

(1987) and others. These papers test intertemporal expected utility
maximization, specifically its implication that the Euler error is

uncorrelated with previous information. A rejection of this null hypothesis

—7—

would rule out the Barro model as well as other neoclassical consumption

models. But as stressed by King (1983), tests of the Euler equation require
specifying the explicit form of preferences, and rejection of the Euler

equation may simply reflect an incorrect choice of preferences. The time
series tests of the Euler equation provide mixed results.

While providing evidence that a minority of households are liquidity
constrained, most micro level studies appear to accept the Euler equation
restriction for the majority of households. For example, both Zeldes (1985)
and Lawrence (1983) use the limited consumption data in the PSID and reach the
conclusion that the Euler equation holds for the great majority of households.
A recent paper by Boskin and Kotlikoff (1986) directly tests the

implication of the Barro model that the age—distribution of resources doesn't

affect the age distribution of consumption. They reject the proposition that
aggregate consumption is invariant to their proxy for the age distribution of

resources. The Boskin—Kotlikoff results should not, however, be viewed as
definitive; their analysis, like other time series studies, is subject to

aggregation bias. In addition, their specification of preferences and
uncertainty, specifically the bivariate distribution of interest rates and
labor earnings, may be inappropriate.

Section III. The Ecual Euler Error Proposition
Let Uikt stand for the utility of household k at time t in Barro clan
i. The combined assumptions of homotheticity and time separability imply that

utility is of the isoelastic form. Hence, we write Uikt as:

of the members of clan I who are in household k and are age a at time t.

Section IV A Test of the Eaual Euler Error Proyosjtion Based on Cohort Data
In this section we develop a method of testing the equal Euler error

proposition using cohort data. We start by taking logarithms of (7),
yielding:

log(C÷1 /Cjkt) —

log(e t+l/(l+r i,t+l ))

Consider all households in clan i whose heads are age a. Take the average of
(10) over all such households.

The resulting average of equation (10) is

given by equation (11) where we define the averages of the left hand side and
the two terms on the right hand side of (10) respectively by:

(11)

i+i j+i +

Note that the term i,t+i is not indexed by age since the Euler errors of each

of clan i's households are identical. Next average (11) over all clans. This

produces (12) where sa is the fraction of age a households that belong to
clan i at time t, and M is the total number of clans.

(12) the cohort average value of i,t is written as the simple unweighted

average of the Euler errors across all clans (the second term on the right
hand side of the equation) plus the cohort average value (weighted by each
clan's fraction of all cohort households) of the deviation of the clan's Euler

error from the unweighted average Euler error over all clans. We make the

—11—

assumption that this third term on the right hand side, which is the
population covariance between a clan's Euler error and its share of its
population in the age group, is zero.

We can rewrite the remaining terms in (12) more compactly by
letting

Because of sampling and measurement error, the true population mean,

Equation (13) forms the basis for our statistical test of the equality of

average cohort percentage changes in consumption. Under the null hypothesis

variance equal to 2. If the null hypothesis fails to hold and the weighted
average Euler errors differ across age cohorts, the error term ,7a will

capture not only measurement and sampling noise, but also each cohort's time t

average Euler error after controlling for age and time effects. Our
alternative hypothesis is, therefore, that Wat is not simply i.i.d., but
depends on age as specified below:

alternative hypotheses.

To see how the alternative hypothesis might hold in a nonaltruistic life
cycle model, consider the case of an individual who (1) lives to time T, (2)
has a logarithmic utility function, (3) receives an income stream in each
period that evolves as a random walk, (4) faces a zero rate of interest, and

(5) has a zero rate of time preference. Under these assumptions the
individual's time t÷l Euler error,

can be related to the error in the

random walk process, t+l' by considering the individual's lifetime budget
constraint. Since the present value of realized lifetime consumption must
equal the present value of realized lifetime resources, it is also true that
the expected present value of lifetime consumption equals the expected present
value of lifetime. resources. In addition, the difference in the expected
present value of lifetime consumption at times t+l and t equals the difference
in the expected present value of lifetime resources at times t÷l and t. This

In considering either (15) or (15') it is important to note that while the

expectation of Et÷l conditional on information at time t equals unity, the

time t expectation of l/Et+l exceeds unity, by Jensen's inequality. The
relationship between

and

involves the expectation of the product of

the reciprocals of future Euler errors. Since the reciprocals of the Euler
errors are not necessarily independently distributed, these expectations do
not lead to a simple relationship between

and t+l In addition, since

these expectations are conditional on the age of the individual, T—t, the
variance of Et÷l can increase or decrease with age even for this case in which
the future income process is independent of age.

Of course, there is no reason to believe that the shocks to full future
resources (including those arising from random rates of return) have the same

variance independent of age. Hence, even ignoring the complex expectations of
equations (15) and (15'), there is, in the context of the Life Cycle Model, no
particular reason to believe that the variance of Euler errors will be

independent of age. While the variance of Euler errors may rise or fall with
age under the Life Cycle Model, one would expect in that model that the
variance of individuals close in age would be quite similar; i.e., one would

expect a gradual change by age in the variance of the Euler error. In
addition, one would expect a positive correlation in Euler errors for

individuals close in age because they will experience similar shocks. The
alternative assumption specified in (14) permits both a correlation in Euler
errors between age groups that is larger the closer together are the age
groups as well as a variance in Euler errors that gradually rises or falls
with age.

Section V. The Data
The ongoing Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES), which began in the first
quarter of 1980, interviews approximately 4500 households in each quarter.
Most households are interviewed four times in the Consumer Expenditure Survey.
The four interviews always ask a common set of questions about consumption,
but some other questions are asked only in the first and fourth interviews,

and others are asked only in the fourth interview. Some households are
interviewed fewer than four times because they drop out of the sample. Others
are interviewed fewer than four times because of the sample design; in an
effort to maintain in each quarter the same fraction of households responding
to a first, second, third, and fourth interview, the CES administers the
second, third, or fourth interviews to some households as their initial

interview. If the household's initial interview is a second interview, the
household will be interviewed two more times. If a household's initial
interview is a third interview, the household will be interviewed once more.

And if the household's initial interview is a fourth interview, the household
will not be reinterviewed.

The approximately 4500 interviews in each quarter are spread over each

month of the quarter. In the interviews households are asked about their
consumption expenditures in the previous three months. Hence, a household
interviewed in January of 1981 reports consumption expenditures for October,

November, and December of 1980, while a household interviewed in March of 1981
reports consumption expenditures for December of 1980 and January and February

of 1981. Unfortunately, for most expenditure items, households only report

—16—

total expenditures in the previous three full months and do not provide a

month—to—month breakdown of those expenditures. As a consequence, the data
for a household interviewed, say in January, cannot readily be combined with
data from a household interviewed in February since the two quarterly

observations cover overlapping, rather than identical quarters. In effect,
each wave of the Consumer Expenditure Survey provides three overlapping sets

of observations on quarterly consumption. In our analysis we treat each of
the three quarterly data sets separately and refer to them as quarterly

samples 1, 2, and 3)- For purposes of analyzing the quarterly data we
considered 58 age cohorts corresponding to ages 23 through 80.

Given the lumpiness of some nondurable consumption expenditures, such as
vacation trips, it is useful to test the equal Euler error proposition with

semi—annual as well as quarterly data. For those households who were
interviewed four times, the four quarterly observations can be combined to

form observations on semi—annual consumption. There are 6 possible semiannual data sets. For example, households interviewed in January, April,
July, and October in year t provide an observation on the ratio of consumption
over the period April—September in year t to consumption over the period

October in year t—l—March in year t. Households interviewed in July and
October of year t and January and April of year t+l provide an observation on
the ratio of consumption over the period October in year t—March in year t+l

to consumption over the period April—September in year t. These types of
observations produce a single data set of semi—annual changes in consumption.

One can also form a data set using households interviewed for the first time
of four times in April and other households interviewed for the first of four

—17—

times in October. Hence, the April—July—October—January sequence provides two
semi—annual data sets. The May—August—November—February sequence provides
another two semi—annual data sets; and the June—September—December—March
sequence provides the final two semi—annual data sets.

Because of the smaller number of households who completed all four
surveys, we constructed three—year age cohorts; i.e., we combined ages 23, 24,
and 25 into one age group, ages 26, 27, and 28 into another age group, etc. up

to the age group covering ages 77, 78, and 79. This difference in the
definition of an age cohort should be kept in mind in comparing the quarterly
and semi—annual results presented in the next section; because of the
difference in definitions one would expect the estimated values of p and

"y

based on the semi—annual data to be roughly the cube of their respective
values based on the quarterly data.
The definition of aggregate consumption used in this study is total
consumption expenditures excluding expenditures on housing, insurance, and

consumer durables. We exclude housing both because adjustments to housing
consumption are infrequent and because it is very difficult to impute

quarterly or semi—annual rent accurately for homeowners. Insurance
expenditures were excluded because such expenditures represent risk pooling as
opposed to consumption per se.

In addition, the data records both negative

and positive amounts of insurance expenditures, where a negative amount

corresponds to a claim payment. Expenditures on durables should clearly be
excluded from the definition of consumption. In contrast; imputed rent should
be included; unfortunately, data on the stocks of durables are not sufficient
for that purpose.

—18—

The CES provides population weights in each quarter for each household

interviewed. These weights depend on the age of the household head as well as
other economic and demographic characteristics. We use the time t+l sample
weights in determining the cohort—specific weighted average value of the
logarithm of the ratio of consumption at time t+l to consumption at time t;

i.e.,

we construct a weighted value of
Households that reported less than $150 of quarterly expenditure on food

were excluded from the sample. This is the only form of sample selection in
our analysis. Some limited analysis indicated that including households with
very small quarterly food expenditure would not materially alter the results.

Section VI. Enmirical Findings
As a prelude to examining estimates of p and -y, Figure 1 considers how
the age—consumption profile changed over the period 1980 through 1984.

Ignoring demographic change, the proposition that each cohort's consumption
should change, on average, by the same percentage, implies a constant age—

consumption profile. In forming Figure 1 we calculated the annual weighted
average of quarterly consumption (measured in 1985 dollars) at each individual
age for households interviewed in April, August, and December of each of the

five years. We combined these weighted averages within each calender year to
produce annual values of average consumption by age of the household. Next we
divided annual consumption in year t
45 year old households in year t.

we smoothed these relative

consumption values for each year by regressing them against an intercept and a

fourth order polynomial in age. In these regressions the

values each

—l 9—

exceed .9. Figure 1 plots the resulting five smoothed polynomials of
consumption at a particular age relative to consumption at age 45.

The curve with the most dashes corresponds to 1980, the curve with the

second most dashes corresponds to 1981, etc. The curves in the Figure suggest
that the age—consumption profile flattened out in 1983 and 1984. Compared
with 1981, for example, the 1984 relative consumption of 60 year olds is over

10 percent larger. The F(20,264) value for the test that the five polynomials
are the same is 17.94, greatly in excess of the 5 percent critical value of

1.66. Since the changes in the shape of the relative age—consumption profile
do not appear to be due to changes in demographics, it provides some evidence
against the Barro Model; however, unlike the next set of findings, these
profiles consider levels, not changes in consumption, and, as such, do riot

control as well for the composition of the sample; i.e., the levels of
consumption of the elderly in 1983 and 1984 may reflect samples whose older
households happened to belong to clans with greater total resources.
Table 1 also provides some preliminary data analysis of the null

hypothesis. This Table compares quarterly changes in consumption of different
age groups for quarterly sample 1. The corresponding tables for quarterly
samples 2 and 3 are quite similar. For purposes of Table 1 we consider five
broad age categories: 23—29, 30—39, 40—49, 50—59, 60—69, and 70 +.

For each

of these six age groups we report quarterly values of 100 times the deviation
A

l9A

of the weighted average ia from the mean value, E

,

taken over the 19

t—l

quarters in our sample. According to (12') and ignoring measurement and
sampling error, these deviations, which we refer to as average adjusted Euler
errors, should be identical for each of the six age groups.

—20—

Table 1 indicates that these average adjusted Euler errors are typically

very different across the six age categories. There are only 5 of 19 quarters
in which the signs of the adjusted Euler errors are the same for each age

group. For quarterly samples 2 and 3, there are only six of 19 and five of 19
such quarters, respectively. Even in quarters when all the adjusted Euler
errors have the same sign, there is still a considerable difference in the

magnitude of the errors. For example, in the third quarter of 1980 all Euler
errors are negative, but the error for the age group 23—29 is less than a

fifth the size of the error for the age group 50—59. Such large differences
between the smallest and largest average Euler error arise in each of the
quarters for each of the three quarterly samples.

Another informal way to assess the data is to regress

on a set of age

group dummies and time dummies, either quarterly or semi—annual. The results
from this regression can be compared with the results from regressing the same
dependent variable on age dummies and the interaction of each of the time

dummies with each of the age dummies.2 According to (13), given a particular
time period t, the age—time interactions should have identical coefficients.

For purposes of this regression using quarterly data, we constructed six age

dummies corresponding to the six age groups of Table 1. The F values for
quarterly samples 1, 2, and 3 are 1.470, 1.237, .746, respectively. Since the
F(90,987) 5 percent critical value is 1.27, the age—time interactions are

significantly different in only one of the three quarterly samples. The
F(25,l03) values in the corresponding regressions for the six semi—annual

samples are .912, 2.414, 2.538, 1.485, 1.768, and .612. The 5 percent
critical value in this case is 1.61. Hence, age—time interactions are

—21—

significantly different in only three of the six semi—annual samples.
Table 2 presents our maximum likelihood estimates for p and -y for the

three quarterly data sets based on individual age cohorts from age 23 through

age 80. None of the reported estimates of these parameters is significantly
different from the values predicted by the null hypothesis of

intergenrational altruism. Indeed, in the case of -y, two of the three
estimates are equal to 1 to four decimal places and the third value of 1.0020

iolies that the variance of

for 70 year olds is only about 15 percent

larger than the corresponding variance for 20 year olds. One of the three
point estimates for p is negative; a negative value of p, even were it
significant, seems highly unlikely from the perspective of the Life Cycle

Model. The other two nonnegative values of p suggest a very small correlation
between the consumption of adjacent age groups. Even if these estimates were
significant, their values seem quite small.

The likelihood functions associated with Table 2 are rather sharply
peaked; hence, one can reject values of p and y that are substantially

different (in an economic sense) from the maximum likelihood estimates. Table
3 presents the range of values of p and y that fall within 95 percent Chi—
squared confidence intervals around the maximum likelihood estimates.3
According to the Table, even if one takes the largest values of p and -y that

cannot be rejected by the data, the resulting estimates provide no strong
evidence of substantial departure from the null hypothesis of
intergenerational altruism.

Since many of the consumption expenditures included in our definition of
nondurable expenditure may not be made each quarter, the results in Table 2

—22—

may, in part, reflect the lumpiness of nondurable expenditures; i.e., the
variance in consumption changes due to the lumpiness of expenditures may

dominate the results. Hence, it may be useful to repeat the analysis using
simply food expenditures which is much less lumpy than, for example, clothing

expenditures or vacation trips. The results based on quarterly food
expenditures are quite similar to the results based on total nondurable—

nonhousing consumption expenditure. The point estimates in the three samples
of p are —.0590, —.0680, and .0020. The point estimates of y in the three

samples are 1.0010, .9980, and 1.0030. The estimates of p and are not
jointly significantly different from 0 and 1, respectively; the respective x2
values for the three samples for the joint test that p equals 0 and -y equals 1

are 4.087, 4.991, and 4.757 —

all

of which lie below the 5 percent critical

value of 5.991.

Another way to consider the lumpiness of expenditures is to repeat the

analysis with semi—annual data. Table 4 presents the results based on the six
semi—annual consumption data sets, which, as mentioned, combine three ages

into a single age cohort. Once again, none of the estimates of p and y are
separately or jointly significantly different from the null hypothesis values
of p—O and -y —

1.

Three of the six point estimates of

lie above 1 and three

lie below 1. Three of the six point estimates of p are positive and three are
negative. Hence, like the quarterly estimates, there is no suggestion in the
data that the null hypothesis is strongly disfavored. Unlike the quarterly
results, however, several of the estimates of -y are economically more

important. For example, the estimate for y in the sixth sample of 1.0220
implies that the variance of

for very old households is over 1.7 times the

—23—

variance for very young households. In addition, for each of the six samples
the confidence intervals around -y include economically significant as well as

economically insignificant values. Thus the semi—annual results do not
provide as strong evidence against the Life Cycle Model as do the quarterly
results.

One might question whether we have properly controlled for demographic

change in treating a as an age—specific time—invariant constant. One way to
consider whether the results are sensitive to treatment of demographics is to
re—estimate the model defining household consumption as household consumption
per household member or per adult equivalent in the household; in forming
adult equivalents we treat each child under age 18 as equal to .5 adults. We-

tried each of these alternative definitions of household consumption. The

quarterly results are essentially the same as those in Table 2. The semiannual results are only slightly different from those in Table 4; when
consumption is measured either as household consumption per member or per
equivalent adult, the null hypothesis is rejected in only two of the six semiannual samples.5

Section VII. Conclusion
After controlling for demographic change and sampling and measurement
noise, the average change in consumption appears to be identical across all

age groups. This rather strong finding is suggested by Barro's model of
intergenerational altruism, in contrast to the Life Cycle Model. An important
attribute of these results is that they are nonparametric in nature;
specifically, in comparing the average change in consumption across age groups

—24—

we place no restrictions on preferences beyond the assumptions of
homotheticity and time separability.
It may be that quarterly changes and even semi—annual changes in

consumption reflect quite lumpy expenditures and that testing the equal Euler
error proposition on annual or even biannual would be more appropriate.
Unfortunately, appropriate data for such an analysis do not currently exist.

Notes
1. Quarterly sample 1 corresponds to households interviewed in April, July,
October, and January. Quarterly sample 2 corresponds to households
interviewed in May, August, November, and February. Quarterly sample 3
corresponds to households interviewed in June, September, December, and March.
In constructing the data for quarterly sample 1, as an example, we form ratios
of a) the July reported quarterly consumption to the April reported quarterly
consumption, b) the October reported quarterly consumption to the July
reported quarterly consumption, c) the January reported quarterly consumption
to the October reported quarterly consumption, and d) the April reported
quarterly consumption to the January reported quarterly consumption. In
forming the average logarithm of the ratio of consumption say in January 1983
to consumption in October 1982, all households who were surveyed in both
October 1982 and January 1983 were included.

and there are 19 time periods. Then the initial regression is:

3. These bounds were constructed by holding one of these parameters fixed at
its maximum likelihood value and varying the other parameter until the
resulting likelihood was significantly (at the five percent level) different
from the maximum likelihood.
4. With household consumption defined as consumption per person the point
estimates for p for quarterly samples 1, 2, and 3 are .0340, —.0430, and
.0440, respectively. For y the corresponding point estimates are 1.0010,
1.0000, and 1.0000. With household consumption defined as consumption per
equivalent adult, the three point estimates for p are .0320, —.0350, arid
•°390A while the three point estimates for y are 1.0010, 1,0000, and 1.0000.
The x' values for testing the null hypothesis that p equals 0 and 'y equals 1,
are 2.094, 1.952, and .395 for the three quarterly samples when consumption is
measured per person, and 2.240, 1.352, and 1.667 for the three quarterly
samples when consumption is measured per equivalent adult.
5. With household consumption defined as consumption per person the point
estimates for p for semi—annual samples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are —.1260,
.0450, —.0840, —.1360, .0570, and —.0060, respectively. For y the

—30—

corresponding point estimates are 1.0010, .9710, .9700, 1.0140, .9970, and
1.023. With household consumption defined as consumption per equivalent
adult, the six point estimates for p are —.1270, '.0770, —.0900, —.1310, .0480,
and .0100, while the six point estimates for y are 1.0090, .9730, .9740,
1.015, .9940, and 1.0210. The six respective semi—annual x2 values for
testing the null hypothesis that p equals 0 and y equals 1 are 3.0763, 7.3924,
8.710, 3.807, .493, and 4.220 when consumption is measured per person, and
3.0441, 6.699, 7.284, 3.735, .533, and 3.581 when consumption is measured per
equivalent adult.
