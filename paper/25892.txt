Optimal Inflation and the Identification of the Phillips Curve
Michael McLeay and Silvana Tenreyro
NBER Working Paper No. 25892
May 2019
JEL No. E31,E52
ABSTRACT
Several academics and practitioners have pointed out that inflation follows a seemingly
exogenous statistical process, unrelated to the output gap, leading some to argue that the Phillips
curve has weakened or disappeared. In this paper we explain why this seemingly exogenous
process arises, or, in other words, why it is difficult to empirically identify a Phillips curve, a key
building block of the policy framework used by central banks. We show why this result need not
imply that the Phillips curve does not hold – on the contrary, our conceptual framework is built
under the assumption that the Phillips curve always holds. The reason is simple: if monetary
policy is set with the goal of minimising welfare losses (measured as the sum of deviations of
inflation from its target and output from its potential), subject to a Phillips curve, a central bank
will seek to increase inflation when output is below potential. This targeting rule will impart a
negative correlation between inflation and the output gap, blurring the identification of the
(positively sloped) Phillips curve. We discuss different strategies to circumvent the identification
problem and present evidence of a robust Phillips curve in US data.

Introduction

A number of recent papers have pointed out that inflation can be approximated (and forecast) by
statistical processes unrelated to the amount of slack in the economy (Atkeson and Ohanian, 2001;
Stock and Watson, 2007, 2009; Dotsey, Fujita and Stark, 2018; Cecchetti et al., 2017; Forbes, Kirkham
and Theodoridis, 2017). The empirical disconnect between inflation and various measures of slack
has been interpreted by some commentators as evidence that the Phillips curve (a positive relation
between inflation and the output gap) has weakened or even disappeared (Ball and Mazumder,
2011; IMF, 2013; Hall, 2013; Blanchard, Cerutti and Summers, 2015; Coibion and Gorodnichenko,
2015).12 . On the face of it, a change in the Phillips Curve relationship could have major implications
for monetary policy, so the potential causes of any weakening have been an important topic of
discussion for policymakers (Draghi, 2017; Carney, 2017a; Powell, 2018).
The Phillips curve is one of the building blocks of the standard macroeconomic models used for
forecasting and policy advice in central banks. Its empirical elusiveness could challenge the wisdom
of these models and the usefulness of their forecasts. Arguably, it even calls in to question part of
the rationale for independent, inflation-targeting central banks. Or does it?
In this paper we use a standard conceptual framework to show why:
• the empirical disconnect between inflation and slack is a result to be expected when monetary
policy is set optimally; and
• it is also perfectly consistent with an underlying stable and positively sloped Phillips curve.
More specifically, our framework is built under the assumption that the Phillips curve always holds
(an assumption we later corroborate in the data). In other words, in our model, inflation depends
positively on the degree of slack in the economy. We also allow for cost-push shocks that can lead to
deviations from the curve, but without altering its slope. Monetary policy is set with the goal of
minimising welfare losses (measured as the sum of the quadratic deviations of inflation from its
target and of output from its potential), subject to the Phillips curve or aggregate supply relationship.

a selection of the vast media comment on the issue, see articles in the Financial Times, Wall Street Journal and The
Economist and opinion piecies by Alan Blinder, Paul Krugman and Lawrence Summers.
2 The output gap is defined as the deviation of output from its potential; in the original paper of Phillips (1958), the
focus was the negative relationship between wage inflation and unemployment

1

In that setting a central bank will seek to increase inflation when output is below its potential. This
targeting rule imparts a negative correlation between inflation and the output gap, blurring the
identification of the (positively sloped) Phillips curve.34
The paper is extended along five dimensions. First, we study differences in the solutions between
discretion – our baseline case in which the monetary authority cannot commit to a future path of
inflation and the output gap – and the case of commitment, in which the authority credibly commits
to a future plan. We show that the main intuition goes through in both cases. The difference lies in
the implied properties of the statistical process for inflation generated by the optimal policy in each
case. In the simple framework studied here, the greater degree of inertia under optimal commitment
also offers one potential solution to the identification problem.
A second extension introduces shocks to the targeting rule. These shocks can be interpreted as
lags in monetary transmission; as shocks to the monetary policy instrument rule; or, in a multi-region
setting, as idiosyncratic demand shocks affecting different regions or countries within a monetary
union. We show that the relative variance of these shocks vis-a-vis the cost-push shocks is key for
the empirical identification of the Phillips curve using standard regression analysis. This result also
rationalises the findings of the vast empirical literature that uses identified monetary policy shocks
to estimate the transmission of monetary policy. Effectively, well-identified monetary policy shocks
should help in retrieving the Phillips curve.
Third, we study a multi-region (multi-country or multi-sector) setting with a common central
bank and discuss conditions under which regional (or sectoral) data can help mitigate the bias
from the endogeneity of monetary policy. The discussion, however, also underscores some of the
limitations faced by regional analysis.
A fourth extension discusses the estimation of a wage-Phillips curve and compares the identification challenges with those faced in the price-Phillips curve.
The final extension departs from the stylised New Keynesian model of Clarida, Galı́ and Gertler
(1999) and studies the aggregate supply constraint in a large-scale DSGE model of the type designed
for forecasting and policy analysis in central banks. In such larger models, the concept of a single,
3 This result follows straightforwardly from the basic New Keynesian model as derived in Clarida, Galı́ and Gertler
(1999), while similar results would obtain in the classic setting of Barro and Gordon (1983).
4 The original Phillips (1958) curve was estimated over 1861-1913 UK data, a period during which Britain was on the
gold standard (King, 2008). The bias we describe here would therefore not have been in effect.

structural relationship between inflation and the output gap is no longer well defined: their reducedform correlation varies according to which shock hits the economy. Nonetheless, we show that the
intuition from the structural Phillips curve in the basic model continues to apply to the reduced-form
Phillips curve in larger-scale DSGE models. In the model of Burgess et al. (2013), designed for policy
use at the Bank of England, a positively sloped reduced-form Phillips curve is present when policy
is set according to an estimated Taylor rule. But under optimal discretionary policy the slope of the
curve changes sign.
We next turn to practical attempts to address the identification issue we raise, focusing on US data.
The simultaneity bias arises due to the behaviour of monetary policy in partially accommodating
cost-push shocks to the Phillips curve. It is magnified because monetary policy seeks to offset any
demand shocks that might otherwise help identify the curve. We discuss three practical solutions
that attempt to circumvent these issues by isolating the remaining demand-driven variation in
inflation.
First, econometricians can attempt to control for cost-push and other trade-off inducing shocks
to aggregate supply, in line with the approach proposed by Gordon (1982). This helps to minimise
the remaining cost-push driven variance in the error term, leaving only demand shocks that can
correctly identify the Phillips curve. In practice, however, the success of this approach requires
successfully controlling for each and every trade-off inducing shock affecting the economy. The
ability to do this may be limited in the recent past, where energy price shocks are less dominant
than in the 1970s.
Second, if econometricians can find suitable instrumental variables, they can purge their output
gap data of any cost-push shocks, leaving only the demand variation needed to consistently estimate
the Phillips curve. With highly autocorrelated cost-push shocks (precluding the use of lagged
variables as instruments), using measures of monetary policy or other demand shocks may be
one set of appropriate external instruments (Barnichon and Mesters, 2019). But if the variance of
monetary policy shocks has fallen since the early 1980s and/or the effect of a shock of a given size
has reduced, as suggested by Boivin and Giannoni (2006), then these instruments may be too weak
to provide a practical solution in the recent data.
We next present evidence on our third solution, using cross-sectional regional variation in unem-

3

ployment to identify the Phillips curve. Following Fitzgerald and Nicolini (2014) and concurrently
with a recent paper by Hooper, Mishkin and Sufi (2019), we use US metropolitan area price and
unemployment data to estimate a Phillips curve including metropolitan area fixed effects, to control
for time-invariant regional heterogeneity in the natural rate of unemployment, as well as time fixed
effects to control for variation over time in monetary policy and the aggregate natural rate. Under
our preferred specification, a steeper Phillips curve re-emerges, with a short-run slope at least twice
as large as any of our estimates using aggregate data.
The idea that endogenous stabilisation policy can hide structural relationships in the data
is an old one, going back at least to Kareken and Solow (1963)’s critique of Milton Friedman’s
evidence on the effect of money on income. They pointed out that a monetary policy that perfectly
stabilised nominal income would completely offset any underlying relationship between income
and measures of money. Similarly, Brainard and Tobin (1968) present a model in which the lead-lag
correlation between money and income following an exogenous change in fiscal policy depends
on the endogenous monetary policy response. Goldfeld and Blinder (1972) study the bias arising
from reduced-form OLS estimation of fiscal and monetary policy multipliers when both policies
are set endogenously. These identification issues are very well known in the context of monetary
policy effects: Cochrane (1994) sets out how they were the primary motivation for the literature on
identified monetary policy shocks.
Several authors over the years have also highlighted the general result that under an optimal
control policy, the correlation between a policy target and policy instrument should be driven
towards zero: including Worswick (1969); Peston (1972); Goodhart (1989) and (in the context of the
Phillips curve) Mishkin (2007).5 This point is perhaps also a specific example of Goodhart’s law:
‘that any observed statistical relationship will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for
control purposes’ (Goodhart, 1984).
In a forecasting context, Woodford (1994) shows that if an indicator is a poor predictor of inflation
that may just be because monetary policy is already responding to it appropriately. Similarly, Edge
and Gürkaynak (2010) point out that unforecastable inflation is a prediction of DSGE models
5 See also a series of blogposts by Nick Rowe (e.g. https://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile canadian initi/2010/12/miltonfriedmans-thermostat.html), who uses the analogy (credited to Milton Friedman) of the relationship between a room’s
temperature and its thermostat.

in which policymakers respond aggressively to stabilise inflation. They suggest that forecasting
performance during the Great Moderation is therefore a poor metric of the models’ success, since
policymakers acted strongly to offset the forecastable component of inflation. Perhaps because
measures of slack are one step removed from monetary policy instruments, these issues seem to
have been often neglected in discussions of the Phillips curve.
Of course, that the empirical Phillips curve may vary with monetary policy was one of the
examples given by Lucas (1976) in his critique. Given their original emphases, both the Lucas
critique and Goodhart’s law are more often applied to explain suboptimal stabilisation policies.
Indeed, several authors have explicitly modelled a situation where policymakers set monetary policy
based on a misspecified or unidentified Phillips curve (Haldane and Quah, 1999; Primiceri, 2006;
Sargent, Williams and Zha, 2006). In these papers, mistakes or imperfect information on the part
of policymakers can lead to changes in inflation expectations that cause the reduced-form Phillips
curve to disappear.6
In contrast, we show how a disappearing reduced-form Phillips curve is also a natural consequence of successful monetary policy. The idea that improvements in monetary policy have flattened
the slope of the reduced-form Phillips curve is often ascribed to researchers and policymakers at
the Federal Reserve.7 Most articulations of this view have tended to focus on the role of improved
monetary policy in anchoring inflation expectations (e.g. Williams, 2006; Bernanke, 2007; Mishkin,
2007; Bernanke, 2010).8
Our point is closely related but distinct: even in a purely static setting in which expectations
play no role, the structural relationship between slack and inflation can be masked by the conduct
of monetary policy. This effect of monetary policy on the Phillips curve has also been highlighted at
various times over the years in the literature and by policymakers. Roberts (2006), Carlstrom, Fuerst
and Paustian (2009) and recently Bullard (2018) highlight the role of monetary policy on inflation
dynamics in simple New Keynesian models with Taylor rules, while Nason and Smith (2008),
6 Relatedly,

others have examined mechanisms through which changes in monetary policy behaviour could change the
underlying structural Phillips curve. For example, Ball, Mankiw and Romer (1988) showed how increases in average
inflation rates, by changing the frequency with which firms reset prices, could change the deep parameters that determine
its slope.
7 Gordon (2013) terms it the ‘Fed view’.
8 The effect of endogenous monetary policy on inflation expectations also features in some leading explanations of the
‘missing disinflation’ following the financial crisis, such as Del Negro, Giannoni and Schorfheide (2015).

5

Mavroeidis, Plagborg-Møller and Stock (2014) and Krogh (2015) explore Phillips curve identification
in detail in similar setups. Haldane and Quah (1999), using a similar model to the one we adopt,
show that optimal discretionary policy can flatten or reverse the slope of the reduced-form Phillips
curve. Fitzgerald and Nicolini (2014) make the same point using an old Keynesian framework, and
like us, use regional data from US metropolitan areas to recover a steeper Phillips curve slope.
Despite these papers, a surprisingly bulky literature has continued searching for a Phillips curve
in the data without addressing the key identification challenge. Our first contribution is to frame
the issue as simply as possible: as a classical identification problem; and as one that is present in the
same standard New Keynesian equations that are taught in graduate economics textbooks. Given
that the New Keynesian framework forms the basis for the models used in central banks, it is also a
natural platform to respond to criticisms of that framework, and of policymakers for their continued
reliance on Phillips curve relationships. A second contribution is to show the extent to which
these conclusions generalise to a more complex dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium (DSGE)
quantitative framework and to different measures of inflation and slack, including articulating
why one should expect to see stronger wage Phillips curve relationships in the data. Our simple
analytical framework also enables us to rationalise findings in various strands of the empirical
literature and to critically evaluate some of the practical solutions to the identification problem. This
discussion motivates our empirical focus on using regional variation to recover a steeper Phillips
curve slope for the United States.
The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces a simple model of optimal policy embedding the Phillips curve and illustrates the ‘exogeneity result’ or disconnect between equilibrium
inflation and output gap under the assumption that the monetary authority cannot commit to a
future path of inflation (discretion). Section 3 illustrates the empirical identification problem. Section
4 presents and discusses extensions of the model and notes some conceptual solutions to achieve
identification. Section 5 examines the solutions in practice using national and metropolitan area
data for the US. Section 6 contains concluding remarks.

Optimal inflation in the basic New Keynesian model

This section uses an optimal monetary policy framework to illustrate why, in equilibrium, one
should expect inflation to follow a seemingly exogenous process, unrelated (or even negatively
related) to measures of slack.
To explain the intuition as starkly as possible, we use the canonical New Keynesian model,
as derived in Clarida, Galı́ and Gertler (1999), Woodford (2003) and elsewhere. Here we closely
follow the textbook exposition from Galı́ (2008). For now, we dispense with the usual IS equation
determining aggregate demand. This equation is necessary only to determine how policy is
implemented. In the basic model it does not constrain equilibrium outcomes, so we can equivalently
consider the policymaker as directly choosing the output gap as their policy instrument. Our model
therefore consists of just two equations: a Phillips curve and a description of optimal monetary
policy.
The (log-linearised) New Keynesian Phillips curve is given by

πt = βEt πt+1 + κxt + ut

(1)

where πt is the deviation of inflation from its target; xt is the output gap, measured as the difference
between output and its potential level9 and ut is a cost-push shock that follows an exogenous AR(1)
process with persistence ρ (ut = ρut−1 + et , where et are i.i.d. and mean zero). We assume that the
Phillips curve has a strictly positive slope, denoted by κ > 0.
The Phillips curve is evidently alive and well in the model: it is the only equation making up
its non-policy block. By construction, we have a positively sloped Phillips curve. Increases in the
output gap clearly increase inflation and falls in the output gap reduce it. Nonetheless, once we
augment the model with a description of optimal monetary policy, this relationship will not be
apparent in the data. Inflation will instead inherit the properties of the exogenous shock process ut .
To show this, we assume that the policymaker sets monetary policy optimally under discretion.
9 In

the full model derived in Galı́ (2008), this is the welfare-relevant gap between output and its efficient level.

7

Period by period, she minimises the following quadratic loss function

Lt = πt2 + λxt2

subject to the constraint (1) and taking expectations of future inflation as given.10 The solution to
the minimisation problem is the policymaker’s optimal targeting rule
λ
πt = − xt
κ

(2)

When faced with a positive cost-push shock that creates a trade-off between the inflation and
output stabilisation objectives, the policymaker balances them, creating a negative output gap to
reduce the degree of above-target inflation. The relative weight placed on each objective depends on
the policymaker’s preference parameter λ.
The Phillips curve (1) and optimal targeting rule (2) together completely determine the path of
inflation in the model. We can solve for equilibrium inflation by using (2) to substitute out for xt in
(1), and by iterating forward to obtain

πt =

κ2

λ

+ λ(1 − βρ)

(3)

In equilibrium, inflation deviations are at all times perfectly proportional to the exogenous cost-push
shock. In other words, with a constant target, equilibrium inflation itself behaves as an exogenous
process. In the limit, when the monetary authority does not put any weight on the output gap
(λ = 0), inflation equals the target rate, a point previously made by Haldane and Quah (1999).
This behaviour is entirely consistent with recent empirical work by Cecchetti et al. (2017) and
Forbes, Kirkham and Theodoridis (2017) suggesting that inflation data in the US and the UK can be
modelled as an exogenous statistical process, unrelated to measures of slack.11 But crucially, the
basic theory is also built under the assumption that monetary policy is at all times constrained by a
working Phillips curve. There is no discrepancy between the two results. The Phillips curve may be
10 Clarida, Galı́ and Gertler (1999) show how minimising such a loss function is equivalent to maximising the welfare of
the representative agent in the model. But it can alternatively be motivated as a simple way to capture the preferences
enshrined in the mandates of modern (flexible) inflation targeting central banks: see Carney (2017b), for example.
11 It is also consistent with the observation that in larger DSGE models such as Smets and Wouters (2007), inflation is
largely explained by exogenous markup shocks (King and Watson, 2012).

the correct structural model of the inflation process, but that does not mean that one should observe
it in the empirical relationship between (equilibrium levels of) inflation and the output gap.
The reason is simple. The policymaker in the model is able to set policy to achieve any desired
level of the output gap. Successful monetary policy should lean against any undesirable deviations
in output from potential, which would otherwise cause inflationary or deflationary pressures.
Precisely because monetary policy can be used to offset the effect of such output gaps on inflation,
their effect should not be visible in the data.
Optimal monetary policy does not seek to eliminate all output volatility: from (2) we can see
that in response to cost-push shocks, the policymaker will prefer to tolerate output deviations from
potential. But such shocks impart a negative correlation between inflation and output, rather than a
positive one. Again, the more successful monetary policy is in managing any trade-offs between
inflation and output, the more it will blur the underlying positive Phillips curve correlation.
To summarise, we have shown that with an optimizing monetary policy, equilibrium levels of
inflation are unrelated to measures of slack. Instead, inflation inherits the statistical properties of
exogenous cost-push shocks. This does not necessarily tell us that the Phillips curve is not present.
In the model, the Phillips curve exists and policymakers are completely aware of its existence. But
because they know exactly how the curve operates, they are able to perfectly offset its effects on
equilibrium inflation.12

3.

Phillips curve identification

As may already be apparent from the discussion in Section 2, regression analysis will have
difficulty in recovering the Phillips curve. Figure 1 shows data simulated from the model described
by (1) and (2), with parameters calibrated as in Galı́ (2008). Specifically, the slope of the Phillips
curve is set at κ = 0.1275, the policymaker’s weight on output deviations relative to quarterly
inflation is set as λ = 0.0213, or around one-third relative to annualised inflation. The discount
factor is set to β = 0.99 and the persistence of the cost-push shock to ρ = 0.5.
Of course, there is no Phillips curve visible in the simulated data. As can be seen from the line
12 Stock and Watson (2009) raise the possibility that, despite its failure to forecast or explain the data, the Phillips curve
is still useful for conditional forecasting. They pose the question ‘...suppose you are told that next quarter the economy
would plunge into recession, with the unemployment rate jumping by 2 percentage points. Would you change your
inflation forecast?’

will produce a negative parameter estimate, γ̂1 = − 16 , reflecting the targeting rule (2), rather than a
consistent estimate of the positive slope of the Phillips curve. Many papers have focused on the
difficulty of controlling for inflation expectations in Phillips curve estimation, but the problem here
is a more straightfoward one.13
The identification problem is a simple case of simultaneity bias. The regressor xt is correlated
with the error term ε t . The naive econometrician does not observe the Phillips curve in the data.
Rather, he or she observes equilibrium inflation and output gap outturns: which are the intersection
of the Phillips curve (1) and the targeting rule (2). In fact, the case here is an extreme one: the

the classic case of simultaneity bias: jointly determined supply and demand equations.
To show the identification challenge, we first plot the two model equations in Figure 2.15 The
Phillips curve (1) is in blue, the optimal targeting rule (2) in red, while the black circles index the
policymaker’s loss function at different levels of loss. The observed inflation-output gap pairs are
the equilbrium where the two lines intersect. With no cost-push shocks to the Philips curve, the
first-best outcome of at target inflation and no output gap is feasible, so the lines intersect at the
origin.
When the upward sloping Phillips curve is subject to cost-push shocks, the equilibrium shifts to
different points along the optimal targeting path, shown in Figure 3. But with monetary policy set
optimally, there are no shifts along the Phillips curve: at all times the equilibrium remains on the

targeting rule, not the Phillips curve. The estimated coefficient is γ̂1 = − λκ = − 16 .
The issue is that the Phillips curve is not identified. Our simple set-up has no exogenous
variables shifting monetary policy. Worse, the only shocks are to the equation of interest, so the
estimated parameter is almost entirely unrelated to the slope of the Phillips curve.16 The problem is
the same one that arises when trying to identify a supply curve while only observing equilibrium
quantities and prices. Without any exogenous demand shifter, there is no way of doing so.

Extensions to the basic model and solutions to the estimation challenge

In this section we study a number of extensions to the basic model. For each extension, we
discuss whether and how it can help solving the Phillips curve’s empirical identification problem. In
Subsection 4.1, we discuss the case in which the monetary authority can commit to a path of inflation
and output gap. In Subsection 4.2, we allow for shocks to the targeting rule and we discuss how

they link to the identified monetary policy shocks in the monetary policy transmission literature.
In Subsection 4.3, we study a multi-region setting. In Subsection 4.4 we discuss the mapping into
a wage Phillips curve. In Subsection 4.5 we extend our analysis to explore the effect of monetary
policy on the Phillips curve in larger DSGE models.

4.1.

Commitment

First, we show that our main results are unchanged when the monetary policymaker is able
to commit to a future plan for inflation and the output gap. In Sections 2 and 3 we assumed
that the policymaker was unable to commit. There are a range of practical issues that may
make commitment difficult: monetary policy committees often have changes in membership and
future policymakers may not feel bound by prior commitments and perhaps relatedly, successful
commitment requires that promises are credible, even when they are time inconsistent. Nonetheless,
the optimal commitment policy is able to achieve better outcomes in the face of cost-push shocks
than optimal policy under discretion, so it is important to know how this affects our results.
It turns out that the same intuition holds, although the precise details slightly differ. Again

process. The equilibrium path is quite different to that under discretion, however. At any point in
time inflation displays history dependence, depending on the entire history of cost-push shocks
rather than just the one in the current period.
Simple regressions will again fail to uncover the Phillips curve. The only difference is that under

commitment, the optimal targeting rule imposes a negative correlation between the output gap and
the price level. The relationship between inflation and the output gap in the simulated data shown
in Figure 4 is noisier, but shows no sign of the Phillips curve embedded in the model. The OLS
estimate of γ in (4) gives the coefficient γ̂1 = −0.085.
At least in the simple framework here, the history-dependence of optimal commitment policy
also suggests a straightforward solution to the identification problem. From (10), the equilibrium
output gap will be correlated with its own lagged values, which can therefore be used as an
instrument. Intuitively, the policymaker chooses to create an output gap even after the cost-push
shock has disappeared. They commit to do so in order to achieve better inflation outcomes when
the shock originally occurs. The policymaker therefore optimally reintroduces the positive Phillips
curve relation that is absent under optimal discretion. As a result, in the simple case here, a suitable
choice of instrument will be able to recover the true Phillips curve slope.

4.2.

Shocks to the targeting rule

The previous sections have illustrated how successful monetary policy might mask the underlying
structural Phillips curve in the data. We now show that the opposite is also true in our model: if
monetary policy is set far from optimally, the Phillips curve is likely to reappear.
So far we have assumed policymakers can implement monetary policy by directly choosing
their desired observable output gap each period. But alas in practice, policymaking is not quite
so simple. In empirical studies we observe lags between changing policy and its impact on the
output gap and inflation, which means that in practice central banks are inflation forecast targeters
(Svensson, 1997; Haldane, 1998). Forecast errors will therefore inject noise into the targeting
rule. Potential output is unobservable, so the output gap must be estimated (with error). And
the effect of the policy instruments actually available (typically the central bank policy rate and
forward guidance on its future path; as well as quantitative easing) on the target variables is also
unknown. Errors from any of these sources will insert noise into the desired balance between
inflation and output gap deviations. These various shocks to the targeting rule correspond closely
to the typical interpretations of identified monetary policy shocks in the empirical literature on this
topic (Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans, 1996, 1999; Romer and Romer, 2004b; Faust, Swanson and

15

Wright, 2004; Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz, 2005; Olivei and Tenreyro, 2007; Gertler and Karadi, 2015;
Cloyne and Hürtgen, 2016). That literature is able to identify a positively correlated response of
inflation and the output gap to monetary policy shocks, in line with the results below.
Returning to optimal policy under discretion, we model implementation errors by including an
AR(1) shock process et in the targeting rule (2) to give
λ
πt = − xt − et
κ

(11)

where et = ρe et−1 + ζ t and ζ t is zero-mean and i.i.d. with variance σe2 .17 We can show that equilibrium
inflation and the output gap now both have an additional term proportional to et . Respectively,
they are given by πt = s1 λut − s2 κet and xt = −s1 κut − s2 (1 − βρe )et , where s1 ≡
s2 ≡

1
λ(1− βρ)+κ 2

and

κ
.
λ(1− βρe )+κ 2

With shocks to the targeting rule, neither equation is identified. The equilibrium values of
inflation and the output gap both depend on a combination of both shocks. Consequently, if either
equation is estimated by OLS, its regressor will be correlated with the regression error term and the
resulting parameter estimate inconsistent. In particular, it follows from substituting the equilibrium
values of πt and xt into the definition of the OLS estimator in the regression (4) that

The size of the simultaneity bias to each equation depends on the relative variances of the shocks.18
Figure 5 plots simulated data for three cases. We set ρe = 0.5 and set the other parameters as before.
First, the red circles show the case where the cost-push shock has a variance 100 times larger than
the targeting rule shock. These look almost identical to the case with only a cost-push shock: the
circles trace out the targeting rule. Second, the green circles show the case when the shocks have
equal variance. The slope is still negative, but flatter. The final case gives the cost-push shock a
variance 100 times smaller than the targeting rule shock, and the data trace out a positively sloped
17 Clarida, Galı́ and Gertler (1999) and Svensson and Woodford (2004) show in the basic New Keynesian model that
when there are policy control lags that mean all variables are predetermined in advance, up to an unforecastable shock,
the optimal targeting rule will take exactly this form, where et is the forecast error. We subtract it from the right hand
side of (11) to match the usual convention that a positive monetary policy shock involves a policy tightening.
18 Carlstrom, Fuerst and Paustian (2009) show a similar equation to illustrate the OLS estimate bias in their framework.

Notes: Table shows the OLS regression coefficients of OLS for the shock distributions described in the notes to Figure 5.
Specifications (2), (4) and (6) (perfectly) control for inflation expectations by subtracting from the dependent variable the
true value of βEt πt1 . The true slope of the Phillips curve is κ = 0.1275, while the true slope of the optimal targeting rule
is − λκ = −0.1667.

Looking at the regression coefficients in Table 1, in the first two cases these are both strongly
influenced by the endogenous policy response embodied in the optimal targeting rule. It also makes
little difference whether or not the econometrician correctly controls for inflation expectations, which
also enter the Phillips curve. In the third case however, the regression coefficient turns positive. The
estimate is actually upward biased in specification 5, which omits inflation expectations. Once these
are controlled for, the bias becomes very small. The regression correctly identifies the slope of the
17

Phillips curve to four decimal places.
The reason the bias disappears is straightforward. When cost-push shocks have a relatively low
variance, most of the variation in the simulated data arises from the shocks to the targeting rule.
With the Phillips curve stable, these movements in the targeting rule now trace out the Phillips
curve, as shown graphically in Figure 6. This suggests that if we can successfully control for the
cost-push shocks ut in (1), then we may be able to limit the bias in estimates of the Phillips curve.

4.3.

Regional Phillips curves

Partly to avoid the difficulties associated with identifying the Phillips curve at the national level,
a number of authors have estimated Phillips curves at a more disaggregated, regional or sectoral
level (Fitzgerald and Nicolini, 2014; Kiley, 2015; Babb and Detmeister, 2017; Leduc and Wilson, 2017;
Tuckett, 2018; Vlieghe, 2018; Hooper, Mishkin and Sufi, 2019). In this subsection we show that in an
extended version of the basic model, this may also help the econometrician to identify the aggregate
Phillips curve.

The key to identification is that at the regional level, the endogenous response of monetary policy
to demand shocks is switched off, ameliorating the simultaneity bias in estimating aggregate Phillips
curves. This point was made by Fitzgerald and Nicolini (2014) as motivation for their estimation of
Phillips curves at a regional level. The same logic can explain why the Phillips curve may be more
evident in countries within a monetary union such as the euro area.19
We assume that the aggregate Phillips curve (1) continues to hold, but that aggregate inflation
and the aggregate output gap also depend on the weighted average of inflation and the output gap
in each of n regions

πt =

∑ αi πti

(13)

xt =

(14)

where ∑in=1 αi = 1 and regional inflation is determined by a regional Phillips curve analogous to (1)
πti = βEt πti +1 + κxti + uit

(15)

with idiosyncratic cost-push shocks uit = ρuit−1 + eti and eti zero-mean and i.i.d over time, but
potentially correlated across regions. We must also specify how idiosyncratic demand shocks and
aggregate monetary policy affect the regional output gap with an equation analogous to the IS curve
in the basic New Keynesian model, given by
xti = Et xti +1 − σ−1 (it − Et πti +1 − rti )

(16)

where the idiosyncratic demand shocks are given by rti = ρr rti −1 + eri and eri are zero-mean and i.i.d
over time, but potentially correlated across regions. The equations can be aggregated together to
give the usual aggregate IS relation
xt = Et xt+1 − σ−1 (it − Et πt+1 − rt )
19 Nakamura

(17)

and Steinsson (2014) present evidence that endogenous monetary and tax policies reduce national fiscal
multipliers relative to local ones.

19

We therefore allow inflation and the output gap are determined partly by idiosyncratic shocks to
each region, but restrict the monetary policy rate it to be the same across all n regions.
We next denote for any regional variable its (log) deviation from the aggregate as ẑit = zit −
∑in=1 αi zit . We can then subtract (1) from (15) to give a Phillips curve in terms of log deviations from
aggregate inflation.
π̂ti = βEt π̂ti +1 + κ x̂ti + ûit

(18)

Subtracting (17) from (16) gives an equivalent IS curve
x̂ti = Et x̂ti +1 + σ−1 ( Et π̂ti +1 + r̂ti )

(19)

Monetary policy is set (under discretion) by minimising the same aggregate period loss function as
in Section 2, subject to the aggregate Phillips curve (1).20 Policy therefore follows the same targeting
rule (2) depending solely on aggregate variables.21
The crucial difference to the identification problem at the regional level is that while monetary
policy perfectly offsets the aggregate demand shocks, rt = ∑in=1 αi rti , it does not respond at all to the
idiosyncratic regional deviations from that average, r̂ti . The regressor in the Phillips curve equation
x̂ti is now affected by exogenous demand shocks that do not influence the aggregate Phillips curve.
As a result, the endogeneity problem is mitigated.
For each region, we can verify that one solution to the model described by (18) and (19) is

π̂ti = c1 (1 − ρ)ûit + c2 κi r̂ti

(20)

x̂ti = c1 ρσ−1 ûit + c2 (1 − ρr β)r̂ti

(21)

and

20 This

differs from the monetary policy that would be welfare-optimal in the model, since welfare would also be
lowered by dispersion in prices within a region, even if average inflation was zero. Clarida, Galı́ and Gertler (2001) show
in the context of an open economy model that the welfare-optimal policy would minimise a loss function that included
the sum across countries of the squared deviations of inflation, rather than the square of the sum of deviations.
21 Although to ensure determinacy, the policymaker’s instrument rule will need to respond to idiosyncratic variables.

20

where c1 ≡

1
(1−ρ)(1−ρβ)−ρκσ−1

and c2 ≡

σ −1
.22
(1−ρr )(1−ρr β)−ρr κσ−1

Unlike aggregate inflation, which

evolves in line with the exogenous shocks to the Phillips curve, regional inflation also depends
on idiosyncratic demand shocks. In the simplest case when the shocks are entirely transitory
(ρ = ρr = 0), the equilibrium output gap deviation will be independent of the idiosyncratic
cost-push shocks ûit and a simple regression of π̂ti on x̂ti will give a consistent estimate of κ.
Away from that special case, inflation expectations present a separate challenge to identifying
regional Phillips curves. With ρ > 0 or ρr > 0, there will be omitted variable bias unless the
econometrician can control for the effect of regional inflation expectations. While possible in
principle, reliable data are likely to be less readily available than at the national level. If crosssectional variation in inflation expectations is important, there is perhaps likely to be more chance
of success when estimating at the country level within a single multi-country monetary authority.
Alternatively, if that variation is constant over time, it can be controlled for using region fixed effects.
A second difficulty at the regional level is that while the specification will help mitigate the bias from
the endogeneity of national monetary policy, insufficient cross-sectional variation in the regional
data will lead to imprecise estimates of κ.

4.4.

The wage Phillips curve

While identification of the price Phillips curve is complicated by the endogenous response of optimal
monetary policy, the focus of the original Phillips study was the correlation between wage inflation
and unemployment in the UK. In this subsection we comment on how optimal monetary policy
maps into the original wage Phillips curve relationship between wage inflation and unemployment.
Intuitively, one might expect the wage Phillips curve to be less vulnerable to identification issues
related to the endogeneity of monetary policy, since wage inflation is one step removed from the
price-inflation targeting remit of most central banks.
As well as a different dependent variable (wage inflation rather than price inflation), the
typical wage Phillips curve attempts to explain inflation using variation in unemployment or the
unemployment gap, rather than the output gap. Using unemployment in the equation is unlikely to
22 While this is one solution, depending on how policy is implemented, there may be a multiplicity of equilbria. It
is beyond the scope of this paper to study those, so we assume that the policymaker’s instrument rule is able to rule
them out. In practice, this will involve responding to deviations of regional inflation or regional output gaps from their
equilibrium values, even when those deviations have no impact on aggregate inflation or the aggregate output gap.

21

solve the identification issues arising from the behaviour of monetary policy for at least two reasons.
First, many central banks’ remits explicitly specify unemployment or employment as one of
their (secondary or dual) target variables. As such, they will optimally set policy to close any gap
between unemployment and its natural rate, unless there is a trade-off between that goal and their
inflation targets, in which case they will seek to balance the two goals, as was the case with the
output gap in Section 2. Monetary policy will therefore blur the structural relationship between
inflation and the unemployment gap in a similar way. Second, even for central banks without an
explicit mandate to minimise fluctuations in employment, when there is co-movement between the
output gap and the unemployment gap, policy will often implicitly seek to stabilise employment.23
There are, however, reasons to think that using wage inflation as the dependent variable might
lessen some of the identification problems. Nominal wage rigidities can be incorporated into the
basic model in an analogous way to price rigidities, as introduced by Erceg, Henderson and Levin
(2000). With both wage and price stickiness, some shocks, such as innovations to firms’ desired
price-markups, will lead to a wedge between the rate of price inflation and the output gap, but
not between the rate of wage inflation and the output gap. Since inflation targeting central banks
typically target price inflation, policymakers may respond by adjusting the output gap to achieve
their desired trade-off with price inflation. But doing so would lead to variation in wage inflation
operating via the wage Phillips curve. Put differently, the equilibrium output gap will be a function
of the exogenous shocks hitting the economy. But if those shocks only directly affect the price
Phillips curve and not the wage Phillips curve, then the output gap will be correlated with the error
term in the former but not the latter, which will be consistently estimated.
The wage Phillips curve may not face quite as severe problems, but there remain limits to how
easily it can be identified under optimal monetary policy. First, while there may be some shocks
that only affect the price Phillips curve, there are likely to be several more that affect both curves
(for a given output gap). Wage mark-up shocks will increase both price and wage inflation relative
to the prevailing output gap. Erceg, Henderson and Levin (2000) show that shocks to household
consumption or leisure preferences, or to total factor productivity, will conversely move price and
wage inflation in opposite directions for a given output gap. Since the inflationary impact of these
23 Galı́

(2011) shows how the basic framework can be easily extended to include unemployment in a way that closely
resembles the output gap in the basic model.

22

shocks will lead policymakers to attempt to lean against them via the output gap, this will induce a
correlation between the output gap and the shocks affecting the wage Phillips curve (for a given
output gap). The direction of the bias will differ according to the shock, but the equation will in
general not be identified.
Second, even if price inflation shocks are particularly prevalent, many typical examples of such
shocks, such as changes in oil prices, have relatively transitory effects on price inflation. Since
monetary policy is typically thought to have its peak effect on inflation with some lag, attempting
to offset very transitory shocks may not be possible. As a result, policymakers are perhaps less
likely to respond to the very shocks that would otherwise have helped econometricians identify the
wage Phillips curve. Conversely, when transitory shocks are affecting price inflation, wage inflation
can sometimes give a better signal of underlying price pressures, which may lead policymakers to
behave at times as if they were targeting wage inflation.24

4.5.

Larger DSGE models

In addition to nominal wage rigidities, larger macroeconomic models of the type used for policy
analysis in central banks usually have a range of other frictions, additional factors of production and
a richer dynamic structure.25 In this subsection we study how the intuition underlying Phillips curve
identification in the basic New Keynesian model translates to the aggregate supply relationship in
larger models.
An overriding conceptual issue in larger DSGE models is that there typically is no single, stable
Phillips curve relationship between inflation and the output gap. In the basic model the output gap
is proportional to firms’ real marginal costs, but this is a special case that does not generalise to
larger models. The reduced-form Phillips curve correlation therefore varies for different shocks.
We illustrate this point in Figure A1 in the Appendix, which shows the inflation-output gap
relationship in a large-scale DSGE model conditional on each type of shock in the model. We use the
COMPASS model, described in Burgess et al. (2013), which was designed for forecasting and policy
24 In

addition, the welfare optimal policy in models with sticky wages typically involves placing a positive weight on
avoiding wage inflation (Erceg, Henderson and Levin, 2000). But we are not aware of any central banks who officially
target wage inflation in practice.
25 See for example Edge, Kiley and Laforte (2010); Burgess et al. (2013); Brubakk and Sveen (2009); Adolfson et al. (2013)
for descriptions of models used respectively at the Federal Reserve Board, the Bank of England, Norges Bank and the
Riksbank.

23

analysis at the Bank of England. The model is in the tradition of well-known medium-scale DSGE
models such as Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005) and Smets and Wouters (2007), in which
similar findings would emerge, as well as DSGE models used in other central banks. The simulated
Phillips curve varies markedly depending on the shock. Conditional on demand-type shocks, such
as to government spending or world demand, there is a positive relationship between inflation and
the output gap. Conditional on cost-push type shocks to wage or price markups, the correlation
turns negative.
Even when we restrict our attention to those shocks we typically think of as demand, there are
different reduced-form Phillips curves for different shocks: the investment adjustment cost shock
has a slope over twice as steep as a government spending shock, for example. These different
reduced-form slopes arise for several reasons. First, the shocks do not all have the same impact
on the output gap relative to real marginal costs and inflation. Second, they each have different
dynamic effects (some shock processes are estimated to be more persistent than others, for example),
which influences the contemporaneous Phillips curve correlations. And related to both points, the
simulations incorporate an endogenous monetary policy response via the model’s Taylor rule. While
the Taylor rule is not sufficient to hide the positive Phillips curve relationships completely, it will be
exerting some influence, the scale of which will depend on the specific shock.
Given these conceptual difficulties, how should we think of the Phillips curve in larger DSGE
models? One interpretation, consistent with the Phillips curve’s inception as an empirical regularity
in the UK data, is that is simply the average reduced-form relationship, conditional on a demand
shock having occurred. The slope of such an object would clearly change over time if some types
of shock became more or less frequent. It would also be vulnerable to the Lucas critique. But if
policymakers judged that such changes were relatively slow-moving, they may still find such an
empirical Phillips curve a useful input into their decisions.
Under that interpretation, the logic we have outlined for the basic model continues to complicate
estimation of empirical Phillips curves in larger models. Figure 7a shows another DSGE simulation
using Burgess et al. (2013), this time for all shocks in the model. Despite the presence of supply
shocks and an endogenous monetary policy response, a positively sloped Phillips curve emerges.
Figure 7b runs an otherwise identical simulation with the model’s Taylor rule replaced by the

Notes: 1000 periods of data are simulated from the model in Burgess et al. (2013) using the MAPS toolkit described in the
same paper. Each period a set of unanticipated shocks are drawn independently from a standard normal distribution. The
red lines show the lines of best fit from an OLS regression of the simulated annual inflation data on the (contemporaneous)
flexible price output gap. The first panel shows the results using the estimated Taylor rule in the model. The second panel
replaces the Taylor rule with the optimal discretionary monetary policy, where the policymaker minimises, period by
period, an ad hoc loss function containing the discounted sum of squared deviations of annual inflation from target (with
a weight of 1) and the output gap (with a weight of 0.25). The solution is calculated using the algorithm of Dennis (2007).

optimal monetary policy under discretion. As in the examples from the basic model, the positively
sloped Phillips curve disappears and its estimated sign turns negative. This is true irrespective of
the shock: Figure A2 in the Appendix shows the correlation under discretion conditional on each
shock. In this more complex setting, the reduced-form slope does not represent any single optimal
targeting rule. But the same intuition continues to hold: monetary policy will seek to minimise any
variation in the output gap that would cause inflation to move in the same direction. Conversely,
following a markup (or cost-push) shock, monetary policy will aim to reduce the output gap at
times when inflation is above target.
Even in larger models, we would argue one can still interpret the Phillips curve as a structural
equation. Although they need not feature a simple structural relationship between inflation and the
output gap, larger New Keynesian models will contain some kind of equivalent aggregate supply

25

constraint. Typically this will contain measures of real marginal costs rather than the output gap.26
It is also likely to have a richer dynamic structure. Given that structure and wider variety of shocks,
if one is able to estimate the full structural model and there is enough variation in the data, then it
may be possible to recover any structural aggregate supply relationship. But precisely because we
do not know the true model of the economy, such an approach may be less robust to misspecification
than the empirical Phillips curve described above.
Moreover, as long as the structural aggregate supply relationship can be specified as a relationship
between inflation and some measure of slack, then the identification issues we raise in the simple
model may still apply. In Burgess et al. (2013), the Phillips curve for consumer price inflation is a
function of past and future inflation; the marginal cost of final output production; and a markup
shock. Figure A3 in the Appendix shows simulated data from the model under a specification of
optimal discretionary policy where the policymaker targets inflation and (instead of the output gap)
the marginal cost of final output production. Just as with the effect of demand shocks on the output
gap in the basic model, the policymaker is able to perfectly offset the effect of all shocks on the
marginal cost. In equilibrium, the only shock that has any effect on the policymaker’s chosen target
variables is the markup shock, which creates a trade-off between them.
These findings from a larger model designed for practical policy use in central banks suggest
another source of variation to identify the structural Phillips curve or aggregate supply relationship.
If the measure of slack targeted by the policymaker is different to the one that directly influences
inflation, then the policymaker will not seek to offset all variation in the inflation-relevant measure.
In the example above, if the policymaker seeks to minimise fluctuations in the output gap this
will not always minimise movements in real marginal costs, since the relationship between the
two measures of slack will vary according to the mix of shocks. The reasoning is analogous to the
discussion of the wage Phillips curve in the previous section. The policymaker’s actions will only
blur the structural Phillips curve in equilibrium to the extent her policy targets are correlated with
the measures of inflation and slack in the aggregate supply relationship.
26 In

the model simulated above, there is a more stable positive relationship across different shocks between inflation
and the relevant measure of real marginal costs than with the output gap.

Solutions to the estimation challenge in practice

In this section we examine Phillips curve identification in practice using US data. The previous
subsection suggested at least three ways econometricians could recover the structural Phillips curve:
1. Supply shocks: if we can control for these well enough, we should be able to recover the
Phillips curve.
2. Instrumental variables: with good instruments for the output gap, uncorrelated with cost-push
shocks, then the structural Phillips curve can be recovered.
3. Regional data: monetary policy does not offset regional demand shocks, while time fixed
effects can control for aggregate supply shocks.
In summary, the identification challenge arises from the presence of cost-push shocks to the
Phillips curve and the partial accommodation of these by monetary policymakers. The size of the
simultaneity bias is magnified because monetary policy seeks to offset any demand shocks that, in
practice, might otherwise help identify the curve.
Each solution attempts to circumvent these issues by isolating the remaining demand-driven
variation in inflation. The first two solutions use aggregate time-series data and the third turns to
the regional cross-section. While a large number of papers have estimated Phillips curves without
addressing the identification issue we raise here, many others over the years have followed one
or more of these approaches, either implicitly or explicitly. Our discussion provides a framework
which ties together these different solutions.
The econometric solutions to simultaneity in economics are well known. And econometricians
will no doubt continue to come up with other innovative ways to successfully identify Phillips
curves.27 But there are reasons to think that using aggregate data, the task is likely to become ever
more difficult. Boivin and Giannoni (2006) showed that both the variance and the effect of monetary
policy shocks had become smaller in the period since the early 1980s, while similar arguments
have recently been made by Ramey (2016). Both suggest that in economies such as the US, with
27 See Barnichon and Mesters (2019), Galı́ and Gambetti (Forthcoming) and Jordà and Nechio (Forthcoming) for some
recent examples, discussed further below.

27

established policy frameworks, policy is now largely conducted systematically. This limits the
remaining exogenous variation in aggregate demand needed to recover the Phillips curve.
An alternative avenue, therefore, is to turn to cross-sectional data. As in Fitzgerald and Nicolini
(2014), we next show that using regional data on inflation and unemployment by metropolitan area,
a steeper Phillips curve re-emerges.

The empirical Phillips curve in the aggregate data

For our empirical exploration, we turn our attention to the US, where Phillips’ UK findings were
translated by Samuelson and Solow (1960). Our inflation data are the (seasonally adjusted) quarterly
annualised log change in core CPI inflation. While PCE inflation has been the FOMC’s preferred
measure since 2000, for most of our sample monetary policy focused on CPI inflation.28 It also
allows us to more readily compare with the US regional price data, which is a CPI measure. Using
core inflation rather than headline is a straightforward mechanical way of stripping out a subset of
the cost-push shocks affecting headline inflation, in line with our first solution above.
Again for comparability with the regional data, we use the (seasonally adjusted) quarterly
unemployment gap as our proxy for slack, measured as the civilian unemployment rate less the
CBO estimate of the long-term natural rate of unemployment. Using the unemployment gap, we
would therefore expect to see a negative structural relationship with inflation. Figure 8 plots the
two time series, alongside a simple scatter plot of the data over our sample period of 1957-2018. The
reduced-form Phillips curve slope is flat and not significantly different from zero. But as is clear
from the time series and has been well-documented elsewhere, the full sample masks a great deal of
time variation in the relationship.
Figure 9 shows how the correlation has varied over time. We split the time periods according to
Fed Chair over our sample period.29 We split Paul Volcker’s chairmanship into two periods, given
the very different inflation and output dynamics at the start and end of his tenure.30
The data can be explained with the traditional narrative of the US Phillips curve over the second

also lag the tenure dates by six quarters to reflect the lags between monetary policy actions and their effect on real
activity and inflation. Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005) and Boivin and Giannoni (2006) both find that monetary
policy has its peak impact on output after around four quarters, and on quarterly inflation after eight quarters.
30 We split the sample at the end of 1983 in line with convention in dating the Volcker disinflation (Goodfriend and
King, 2005).

half of the 20th century, as discussed in histories by King (2008) and Gordon (2011). In the latter
years of William McChesney Martin’s 23 year term, with the Phillips curve viewed as an exploitable
long-run trade off, overly accommodative fiscal and monetary policies led to unemployment falling
steadily below today’s estimate of its natural rate (Romer and Romer, 2004a). Inflation rose at the
same time, resulting in a downward sloping Phillips curve visible in the data (driven by rises in xt
in (1)).
During Arthur Burns’s tenure in the 1970s, a combination of factors increased both inflation and
increased unemployment, leading to a disappearance of any discernible Phillips curve correlation.
Those factors were a series of large cost shocks (increases in ut in (1)) brought about by oil supply
disruption31 , and the Federal Reserve’s inability, unwillingness32 or miscalculations33 in trying to
lean against them (falls in et in (11)) and their impact on inflation expectations34 (increases in Et πt+1
in (1)).
The beginning of Paul Volcker’s tenure saw a re-emergence of a steep negative Phillips curve
slope, as tighter monetary policy induced rises in unemployment and a sustained fall in inflation

For the subsequent two decades under Paul Volcker and then Alan Greenspan, the Phillips
correlation all but disappeared. The causes of the Great Moderation are often divided into those
relating to good policy, good luck (in the form of lower shock variance, particularly of supply
shocks), and changes in the structure of the economy (Stock and Watson, 2002).
Despite the Great Moderation coming to an end with the 2008 financial crisis and a large rise in
unemployment, the Phillips curve correlation that reappeared under the tenures of Ben Bernanke
and Janet Yellen has been at best weak. The lack of a large deflation following the crisis has sparked

30

a burgeoning literature attempting to explain the ‘missing disinflation’ by appealing to one or
more of: a flatter structural Phillips curve slope; better anchored inflation expectations or increases
in inflation expectations; the inflationary effects of financial frictions; or weaker potential supply
growth (see Coibion and Gorodnichenko, 2015, for a discussion).
The reduced-form evidence in Figure 9 has led many commentators to conclude that the Phillips
curve has flattened over time. It is also consistent with estimates using more sophisticated techniques.
In an influential contribution, Ball and Mazumder (2011) estimate a time-varying Phillips curve
using median inflation as a measure of core inflation. They report that the Phillips curve steepened
from -0.23 in 1960-72 to -0.69 in 1973-84 and then flattened to -0.14 in 1985-2010. Blanchard, Cerutti
and Summers (2015) and Blanchard (2016), extending the non-linear Kalman filter estimates of IMF
(2013), find that the Phillips curve slope fell from around -0.7 in the 1970s to around -0.2 from the
1990s onwards.
Over the period since 1990 (spanning the Great Moderation, then the financial crisis and its
aftermath) a flat Phillips curve is common across a range of typical empirical specifications. Table
2 presents simple OLS estimates using data on quarterly annualised core CPI inflation and the
unemployment gap/rate, over a sample from 1990-2018. The first column shows a simple bivariate
regression of inflation on the CBO measure of the unemployment gap. The second estimates a
typical New Keynesian Phillips curve by replacing the constant term with a survey-based measure
of forward-looking inflation expectations from the SPF.35 The third estimates an acelerationist-style
Phillips curve (Phelps, 1967; Friedman, 1968) by using (three) lags of inflation as a proxy for inflation
expectations. The fourth, fifth and sixth columns nest both models in a hybrid Phillips curve (Galı́
and Gertler, 1999), which feature both forward-looking expectations and lags of inflation (either
as an alternative proxy for inflation expectations or as an additional source of inflation dynamics).
The three hybrid curves feature different specifications for unemployment: they use either the
unemployment rate; or else the unemployment gap, with or without additional lags.
Across the different specifications, the steepest Phillips curves slopes are only -0.20 (for the
bivariate regression) and -0.17 (augmenting with survey-based inflation expectations). These are in
35 We use five to ten year ahead inflation expectations, as suggested by Bernanke (2007) and Yellen (2015) as having a
stronger empirical fit with the data. See Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Kamdar (2018) for an extensive review of the use of
survey expectations in the Philllips curve.

line with the flattened Phillips curve slope found by Blanchard, Cerutti and Summers (2015). In
all of the specifications featuring lags of inflation (either to proxy for inflation expectations or as
an additional source of dynamics), the slope is flatter still and not always significant. The sum of
the coefficients on the forward and backward looking inflation terms is close to 1 in each of the

32

estimates (ranging from 0.9-1.1), in line with natural rate theories of unemployment, which predict
stable long-run inflation if and only if U = U ∗ .
In all, the results from these ”naive” Phillips curves estimates would suggest that the relationship
still exists, but that the slope is relatively flat. Since policymakers also pay close attention to
similar estimates, then the identification issue we highlight has the potential to provide misleading
inferences for monetary policy. A flatter Phillips curve implies a higher ”sacrifice ratio” associated
with bringing inflation back to target, which could lead policymakers to place greater weight than
optimal on avoiding volatility in output and employment relative to inflation (Blanchard, Cerutti
and Summers, 2015). At worst, weaker evidence of a clear link between real activity and inflation
could be interpreted as a sign that there is no short-run policy trade-off between the two goals,
leading policymakers to abandon the natural rate hypothesis (Taylor, 1998; Cogley and Sargent,
2001). Given its importance for policy, we next discuss the different approaches to identifying the
Phillips curve using aggregate data.

5.2.

Identification using aggregate data

In the extensive literature estimating Phillips curves, a number of papers have adopted approaches
similar to those we suggest, implicitly or explicitly addressing the identification difficulties we
highlight here.36 Encouragingly, even in the period since the first draft of this paper was circulated,
several others have proposed new identification strategies to mitigate simultaneity bias in Phillips
curve estimation. In this subsection we discuss the findings from some of those contributions and
categorise them according to our conceptual framework.
5.2.1

Controlling for supply shocks

In principle, if econometricians can perfectly control for the effect of any cost-push or other trade-off
inducing shocks, then any remaining variation in the output gap and inflation must be due to
movements in aggregate demand. As in our estimates above, the many papers that estimate Phillips
curves using core inflation are already implicitly controlling for cost-push shocks to some degree,
by stripping out their direct effects on the price data.37 Others include the change in the oil price as
36 See

Mavroeidis, Plagborg-Møller and Stock (2014) for a comprehensive summary.
Hasenzagl et al. (2019) for evidence on the different channels through which cost-push shocks to energy prices
impact inflation.
37 See

33

a regressor (e.g. Roberts, 1995).
The idea of controlling for supply shocks was even present in the original Phillips (1958) article,
which describes periods during which cost-push effects led to deviations from the fitted curve. More
recently it has been associated with the ”triangle model” of Gordon (1982), originally developed to
account for the shift in inflation dynamics in the 1970s.38 As described in Gordon (2013), the model
includes several variables to control for changes in aggregate supply: food and energy price inflation;
relative import price inflation; changes in trend labour productivity; and dummies reflecting the
start and end of the Nixon price controls in the 1970s.39
Despite including these variables to control for supply shocks, Gordon (2013) still finds a
flattening in the Phillips curve slope coefficient on the long-term unemployment gap: from -0.50 to
-0.31 when he extends his sample from 1962-96 to 1962-2013.40 The smaller absolute coefficient could
be due to a flattening in the structural Phillips curve slope, but could also be due to difficulties
with the practical implementation of the approach in the recent data. The solution is arguably more
suited to helping identify the Phillips curve in a period such as the 1970s, when were large, easily
identifiable cost-push shocks and a higher variance of monetary policy shocks than more recently.41
A related idea is that of Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015), who argue that the supply shock
imparted by higher oil prices also pushed up inflation between 2009 and 2011 by increasing firms’
inflation expectations, which they proxy using household expectations.42 Following Roberts (1995),
they use the Michigan Survey of Consumers, and find a stable Phillips curve slope of between -0.2
and -0.3 (using the unemployment gap) in both the 1981-2007 and 1981-2013 periods.
In both cases, the large number of supply variables in Gordon’s model point towards a more
general practical difficulty, which is that there are many trade-off inducing shocks that need to be
controlled for, and which of these are most important may vary over time. As an example, the
explanations in the DSGE models of Christiano, Eichenbaum and Trabandt (2015) and Gilchrist
et al. (2017) for the lack of disinflation during the financial crisis rely on financial frictions that
38 And

subsequently refined in a series of papers, most recently in Gordon (2013).
model also includes a large number of lags of inflation (up to 6 years) to capture additional dynamic factors
affecting inflation.
40 Gordon instead emphasises the smaller flattening in the point estimate when using the short-term unemployment
rate as the relevant concept of slack, although this measure correlates less closely with estimates of the overall output gap
than the total unemployment rate – largely due to the large negative output gap during the financial crisis.
41 The standard deviation of the Romer and Romer (2004b) monetary policy shock series is 2.5 times smaller in the
period from 1990 onwards.
42 See also Hasenzagl et al. (2019).
39 The

34

simultaneously increased inflation and decreased real activity. That suggests one may also need to
add a measure of financial frictions as an additional explanatory variable.
In some senses, the many papers that estimate the slope of a Phillips curve as part of a fully
specified New Keynesian DSGE model are also adopting a variant of this approach. Schorfheide
(2008) shows how full-information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation of a simple New Keynesian model corrects for the simultaneity bias that markup shocks introduce into the slope of the
Phillips curve. But he also reports evidence from the literature on how sensitive such estimates are
to model specification, with estimates of the coefficient on the output gap varying from 0 to 4.
5.2.2

Instrumental variable estimation

An alternative solution is to use instrumental variable methods. The econometrician must find a
valid instrument that correlates with the demand variation in the output gap, and is uncorrelated
with the cost-push shock. The fitted value from a first-stage regression will then purge the output
gap measure of the endogenous response of monetary policy to the cost-push shock, meaning it can
be used to recover the true Phillips curve slope.
Instrumental variable methods, and especially IV-GMM estimation, have been common in much
of the literature estimating New Keynesian Phillips curves, including influential papers by Galı́ and
Gertler (1999) and Galı́, Gertler and López-Salido (2001). These papers use only lagged variables
as instruments, which should be orthogonal to the current period cost-push innovation. But as
discussed in Mavroeidis, Plagborg-Møller and Stock (2014) and more recently in Barnichon and
Mesters (2019), if the cost-push shocks exhibit autocorrelation, then shocks will still be correlated
with the lagged variables and the exclusion restriction will not be satisfied. The instruments
used must be of a greater lag length than the lag order of the cost-push shocks, but with highly
autocorrelated cost-push shocks, such instruments are likely to have low relevance.
Alternatively, separately identified demand shocks can be used as a set of external instruments,
as recently proposed by Barnichon and Mesters (2019). To satisfy the exclusion restriction, the
candidate instruments should be uncorrelated with the cost-push shocks in (1). Monetary policy
shocks, which are not usually thought to affect supply, are a natural candidate.
Essentially, this strategy applies the findings from the large literature on identifying monetary

35

policy shocks to recover the Phillips curve.43 Given the major focus of that literature has been to try
to remove the systematic response of monetary policy to economic developments, it should be able
to successfully distill the Phillips curve relationship.
Recent work by Barnichon and Mesters (2019) follows exactly this approach. Using the Romer
and Romer (2004b) narrative measure of monetary policy shocks as instruments for the output gap,
they find a much steeper Phillips curve slope than under OLS.
The approach faces the same challenges as outlined by Ramey (2016) for the monetary policy
shock literature. She argues that in the period since 1990, monetary policy has been set more
systematically, and as a result, there is only a limited amount of true exogenous variation in the
data, leading to weak instrument issues.
Identification of monetary policy shocks using high-frequency data may offer one solution
(Kuttner, 2001; Faust, Swanson and Wright, 2004; Gertler and Karadi, 2015; Nakamura and Steinsson,
2018). The short-time windows over which these shocks are identified help remove any traces of
endogenous monetary policy (Nakamura and Steinsson, 2018), which might otherwise be amplified
if the shocks were weak instruments for the output gap. Barnichon and Mesters (2019) use the high
frequency identified shocks of Gertler and Karadi (2015) for the post 1990 period and find evidence
of a flatter Phillips curve slope than in the earlier period.
Other demand shocks, such as fiscal shocks to government spending or taxes, could in principle
also be used as external instruments. But for them to successfully capture sufficient variation in the
output or unemployment gap, the shocks must not be offset by any endogenous monetary policy
response. In the basic model presented in Section 2, fiscal shocks do not help identify the Phillips
curve, since they are completely offset by optimal monetary policy. Relative to monetary policy
shocks, a second drawback is that some fiscal changes are more likely to affect aggregate supply,
and so they may not satisfy the exclusion restriction.
Both drawbacks are evident in the large-scale DSGE model simulations in Subsection 4.5. Figure
A2 shows that under the loss minimising monetary policy, there is little remaining variation in
inflation and the output gap following government spending shocks. And as the shock affects
supply and therefore induces a small trade-off between these two policy goals, the variation that

example, Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (1996, 1999); Romer and Romer (2004b); Uhlig (2005); Bernanke,
Boivin and Eliasz (2005); Olivei and Tenreyro (2007); Cloyne and Hürtgen (2016).

36

does remain results in a negative correlation between the two variables. These simulations also
highlight that the Phillips curve may vary for different types of demand shock. If so, then the
curve conditional on a monetary policy shock is arguably the more relevant one for monetary
policymakers, since it relates directly to their policy instrument.
Related to these ideas, a recent paper by Galı́ and Gambetti (Forthcoming) estimates Phillips
curves conditional on identified demand shocks in a VAR. They find that while endogeneity issues do
lead to downward bias in estimates of the US wage Phillips curve, there has also been a structural
flattening over time.

5.3.

Identification using regional data

Given some of the practical difficulties using aggregate data in the presence of systematic monetary
policy, an alternative solution is to exploit cross-sectional variation. An interesting recent approach
in this vein is Jordà and Nechio (Forthcoming), who take advantage of the fact that economies with
fixed exchange rates are unable to implement independent monetary policies.
To show the possibility of using regional data to identify the aggregate US Phillips curve, we use
a panel of city-level price inflation and unemployment data, as in Fitzgerald and Nicolini (2014).
Hooper, Mishkin and Sufi (2019) also make use of US city-level (and state-level data) in their detailed
study of the US wage and price Phillips curves. Our city-level dataset, containing price data, is an
extended and updated version of the one used by Kiley (2015) and Babb and Detmeister (2017).
5.3.1

Data description

We use data from 28 US metropolitan areas published by the BLS.44 Together these areas account
for over one-third of the US population (Babb and Detmeister, 2017). There is significant size
44 Specifically,

we use 22 of the 23 areas for which CPI data is currently published by the BLS: Atlanta-Sandy
Springs-Roswell, Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, Dallas-Fort WorthArlington, Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, Los Angeles-Long
Beach-Anaheim, Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, Minneapolis-St Paul-Bloomington, New York-Newark-Jersey
City, Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, San Diego-Carlsbad, San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward,
Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, St Louis, Tampa-St Petersburg-Clearwater, Urban Alaska, Urban Hawaii and WashingtonArlington-Alexandria. We exclude Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, for which data are only published from 2018
onwards. In order to maximise the size of our cross-sectional sample, we also add the six previously published
metropolitan areas for which CPI data was discontinued after 2017: Cincinnati-Hamilton, Cleveland-Akron, Kansas City,
Milwaukee-Racine, Pittsburgh and Portland-Salem. The earlier conference draft of this paper used a smaller sample of
only 23 areas. Moving to the full set yields almost identical results. Since 2018, the BLS has published separate CPI
backdata for Washington and Baltimore (although based on a much smaller sample), which were previously only available
combined. We opt to split them given the quite different behaviour of the data in the two areas.

37

heterogeneity across the sample - weighted by average labour force, the largest three areas (New
York, Los Angeles and Chicago) account for 31% of the total, while the smallest thirteen areas
account for less than 2% each. Since six cities in our sample were discontinued after 2017, we opt to
exclude the observations from 2018 H1 onwards.45 Our full sample runs from 1990 H1 to 2017 H2,46
with some gaps for metropolitan areas where the data were only published in the later part of the
sample.47
The inflation series is the annualised log change in the semiannual CPI excluding food and
energy. For the majority of metropolitan areas, data are also available at a higher frequency, but in
order to maximise our cross-sectional sample, we opt to convert these to semiannual data.48 The
city-level CPI data are not seasonally adjusted by the BLS.
For unemployment, we take the BLS’s metropolitan statistical area measures of unemployed as a
percentage of the share of civilian labour force.49 The BLS publish both seasonally adjusted and
unadjusted labour force data at the metro area level – we use the unadjusted series, consistent with
the CPI data. We take the average of the unemployment rate to convert the monthly published data
to semiannual averages.
We also run specifications using survey-based measures of 12 month inflation expectations from
the University of Michigan Consumer Survey. The Michigan Survey includes data published for
four broad geographical regions: the North East, North Central, South, and West. We assign each
metropolitan area to its appropriate region (or the region containing most of the metropolitan area’s
population, for metro areas that span more than one region).
45 We

use the terms city and metropolitan area interchangeably.
area unemployment is published from 1990. In the conference draft of this paper we also used CPI price
level data only from 1990 onwards. Here we make use of the longer published backrun of the CPI to construct a inflation
(and lagged inflation) rates for 1990.
47 CPI data for Tampa are published only from 1997 H2; Phoenix from 2002 H1. Our results are robust to excluding
both cities.
48 Where the semiannual CPI figure is published by the BLS, we use that. Where only monthly data are published, we
take the semiannual average. Where the published data are published only in certain months, we follow BLS methodology
and estimate the missing months via interpolation, before taking the semiannual average (see also Fitzgerald and Nicolini,
2014).
49 The local unemployment data use the CBSA deliniations of metropolitan areas, which the CPI data have also used
since 2018, having previously used sightly different MSA definitions. We match the unemployment data to the currently
used definition, since the BLS treats this as continuous with the old one for CPI. For the subset of cities where CPI data
were only ever published under the old definition, we sum unempoyment and the labour force data for the matching
CBSA metropolitan and micropolitan areas.

Regional data results

To motivate our regional empirical specification, first note that we only have data on the unemployment rate at the regional level, rather than the unemployment gap to proxy for the output gap.
If the regional Phillips curves are of a form similar to (15), transformed to include the regional
unemployment gap (Uti − U ∗ it ):
πti = βEt πti +1 − κ (Uti − U ∗ it ) + uit

(22)

If, as is likely, the regional equilibrium unemployment rate, U ∗ it is positively correlated with the
actual unemployment rate, then in a pooled OLS regression such as

πit = α + γ1 Et πit+1 + γ2 Uit + ε it ,

(23)

the omitted variable will bias the estimated coefficient γ̂2 towards zero. To partially address this we
run specifications including metropolitan area fixed effects (αi ):

πit = αi + γ1 Et πit+1 + γ2 Uit + ε it ,

(24)

which control for time-invariant regional differences in U ∗ (as well as time-invariant inflation
expectations), although not for time-variation in those regional differences.
Second, as long the regional unemployment rate is correlated with the aggregate unemployment
rate, and regional inflation is affected by aggregate cost-push shocks, then the slope estimate will
still be biased by the endogenous response of monetary policy to aggregate cost-push shocks. To
avoid this, note that our theoretical Phillips curve in terms of regional deviations from the aggregate,
(18), can be rearranged to give:

πti = πt + βEt (πti +1 − πt+1 ) + κ ( xti − xt ) + ûit

= βEt πti +1 + κxti + (πt − βEt πt+1 − κxt ) + ûit

(25)

where xti are uncorrelated with ûit but are correlated with the aggregate cost-push shock ut =

39

πt − βEt πt+1 − κxt . We can therefore remove any monetary-policy induced correlation between the
regressor and the error term by also including time fixed effects (δt ):

πit = αi + γ1 Et πit+1 + γ2 Uit + δt + ε it

(26)

which will also control for any time-varying changes in the aggregate equilibrium unemployment
rate.
To compare across the different specifications, we estimate each of equations (23), (24) and (26).
As additional controls we include seasonal dummies and, given the data are semiannual, just a
single lag of inflation. For completeness we also show results including time fixed effects but not
including metropolitan area fixed effects. The results are shown in Table 3. All four estimates of the

Notes: The table shows coefficients and standard errors estimated from four regional Phillips curve specifications. Core
CPI inflation is the dependent variable in each case. Specification (1) estimates equation 23 (plus controls) by pooled OLS.
Specification (2) estimates equation 24 (plus controls) using group (area) fixed effects. Specification (3) is identical to (1)
apart from the inclusion of a set of year dummy variables. Specification (4) is identical to (2) apart from the inclusion of a
set of year dummy variables. The additional controls are one lag of core CPI inflation and a seasonal dummy variable
for each metropolitan area that takes the value of 1 in H2 and 0 in H1. All specifications contain a constant. Data are
semiannual non-seasonally adjusted measures from 1990 H1 to 2017 H2.

Phillips curve slope are statistically significant and with the correct sign. In the first column, the

40

pooled OLS estimate of -0.15 suggests a flat Phillips curve. It is slightly larger than the estimates
with lagged dependent variables using aggregate data in Table 2, but no steeper than the estimates
without lagged inflation.50

that the estimated coefficient on inflation expecatations is not robust to changes in the sample. Estimating
pooled OLS on a sample beginnning in 1991 instead of 1990 reduces the point estimate from 0.60 to 0.36.

curve slope. Figure 10b shows averages of the same data, where the unemployment and inflation

In the second column we include area fixed effects and the point estimate of the slope is slightly
larger, although not significantly so.

In the third column we include year fixed effects but not area fixed effects, purging the data of
any aggregate-level variation over time, including changes in monetary policy and in the natural
rate of unemployment. The estimated Phillips curve slope steepens to -0.27, as shown in Figures 11a
and 11b.
In the fourth column, metro area fixed effects are also included, controlling for any time-invariant
unobserved factors such as different average levels of U ∗ across regions. The resulting Phillips curve
is -0.38, 2.5 times larger than the pooled OLS estimate and. The residuals and slopes including both
sets of fixed effects are shown in Figures 12a and 12b; as well as in 13, which plots the estimated
Phillips curve by metropolitan area, with different intercept terms for each city.
These results provide evidence of a robust US Phillips curve at the regional level. They are

Notes: The figures are a graphical illustration of the Phillips curve slope estimated in specification (4) in table 3. For each
metropolitan area, the figure plots the residuals from a fixed effects regression of core CPI inflation on all regressors
other than the unemployment rate, with a different area fixed effect plotted for each city, against the residuals from a
fixed-effects regression of the unemployment rate on all other regressors.

consistent with the idea that because monetary policy endogenously offsets changes in aggregate
demand, and leans against cost-push shocks, identification is blurred at the aggregate level.

Conclusion

We use standard analytical framework to explain why inflation follows a seemingly exogenous
statistical process, or, in other words, why the Phillips curve cannot be easily identified with
macroeconomic data. In the framework, a monetary authority minimizes welfare losses, measured
as deviations of inflation and output from their targets, subject to a Phillips curve. This leads the

43

authority to follow an optimal targeting rule in which it seeks to increase inflation when the output
gap decreases. This imparts a negative relation between inflation and the output gap that blurs the
identification of the positively sloped Phillips curve. In equilibrium, inflation inherits the statistical
properties of any cost-push shocks affecting the Phillips curves (e.g., energy price shocks, exchange
rate changes, and so on).
We show that shocks to the targeting rule are key for the identification of the Phillips curve.
These targeting shocks can take the form of monetary policy shocks in a Taylor rule or, in a multiregion setting or a multi-country monetary union, idiosyncratic demand shocks affecting the various
regions or countries in different ways. In a univariate regression analysis, if the relative variance
of these shocks is sufficiently high, vis-a-vis the remaining variance of the cost-push shocks that
cannot be controlled for, the slope of the Phillips curve can be identified. Similarly, identification
of monetary policy or other demand shocks allows the positive relationship between inflation and
output gap to be distilled.
We have also shown how the simple framework here can jointly rationalise several empirical
findings on the Phillips curve. First, it should be weaker in periods when there are large cost shocks
– such as the 1970s – and when monetary policy is relatively successful in achieving its targets –
as in the inflation targeting era. Second, wage Phillips curves should be more evident in the data
that price Phillips curves. And third, the Phillips curve relationship should appear stronger in
disaggregated panel data than in aggregate data.
To summarise, the paper explains the identification problem posited by the estimation of Phillips
curves; rationalises findings in the empirical literature and discusses practical solutions to the
identification problem, showing evidence of a steeper Phillips curve in US regional data. In doing
so, the paper hopes to address a recent wave of work questioning the existence of a link between
inflation and slack, a key building block of the prevalent monetary policy framework.

Notes: For each panel, 1000 periods of data are simulated from the model in Burgess et al. (2013) using the MAPS toolkit
described in the same paper. For each panel, a realisation for the specified shock is drawn each period from a standard
normal distribution. All other shocks are set to zero. The red lines show the lines of best fit from OLS regressions of the
simulated annual inflation data on the (contemporaneous) flexible price output gaps. Monetary policy is specified using
the estimated Taylor rule in the model.

normal distribution. All other shocks are set to zero. The red lines show the lines of best fit from OLS regressions of the

under discretion, where the policymaker minimises, period by period, an ad hoc loss function containing the discounted
sum of squared deviations of annual inflation from target (with a weight of 1) and the output gap (with a weight of 0.25).
The solution is calculated using the algorithm of Dennis (2007).

normal distribution. All other shocks are set to zero. The red lines show the lines of best fit from OLS regressions of the
