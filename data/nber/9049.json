    "abstract": "\n\nCorporate events, such as new issues and new lists, appear in waves.  These waves imply that the market portfolio has a time-varying weight in new lists, and one can decompose the market return into a fixed weight return plus a timing return. Most of the reduction in aggregate market returns caused by holding new lists comes from timing, not from average underperformance.   When new lists are a high fraction of the market, subsequent returns for both new and old lists are low.  A mean variance optimizing investor holding the market would be better off replacing holdings of new lists with old lists, t-bills, or even currency stuffed in a mattress.\n\n",
