    "abstract": "\n\nOver the course of the nineteenth century manufacturing in the United States shifted from artisan shop to factory production.  At the same time United States experienced a \"transportation revolution\", a key component of which was the building of extensive railroad network.  Using a newly created data set of manufacturing establishments linked to county level data on rail access from 1850-70, we ask whether the coming of the railroad increased establishment size in manufacturing.   Difference-in-difference and instrument variable estimates suggest that the railroad had a positive effect on factory status.  In other words, Adam Smith was right -- the division of labor in nineteenth century American manufacturing was limited by the extent of the market.\n\n",
