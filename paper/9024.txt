ABSTRACT
This paper uses play-by-play accounts of virtually all regular season National Football League
games for 1998-2000 to analyze teams' choices on fourth down between trying for a first down and
kicking. Dynamic programming is used to estimate the values of possessing the ball at different points
on the field. These estimates are combined with data on the results of kicks and conventional plays to
estimate the average payoffs to kicking and going for it under different circumstances. Examination of
teams' actual decisions shows systematic, overwhelmingly statistically significant, and quantitatively large
departures from the decisions the dynamic-programming analysis implies are preferable.
