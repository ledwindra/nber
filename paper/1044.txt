The Role of Expectations in The
Choice of Monetary POlicy

Abstract

This paper reviews and contrasts different views about the role of

expectations in policy research and practice. Recently, two widely different views seem to have dominated the analysis of policy questions.
One view, which is referred to as the "new classical macroeconomic"
view, is that expectations overwhelm the influence of monetary policy.
The other view, which is referred to as the "Keynesian" macroeconomic
view, is that expectations are unimportant because people do not adjust

to expectations of policy change. The paper argues that both these views
are misleading. It advances a new view of the role of expectations that -

is

still emerging from current macroeconomic reearch. The new view

recognizes the importance of contractual arrangements which prevent a
modern economy from adjusting instantaneously to policy changes, even

if they are expected. But it also emphasizes that forward—looking expectations influence how these arrangements are set up and how they

evolve over time. Recent criticisms of this new view are reviewed, and
examples are given to illustrate how quantitative methods that incorporate
this view can be used in practice.

The Role of Expectations in the
Choice of Monetary Policy

by
John B. Taylor
Princeton University

There has probably never been a concensus among economists about the

role of expectations in formulating monetary policy. Today two widely
different views seem to dominate policy research and practice. One view,
which I will refer to here as the "new

classical

macroeconomic" view,

is that expectations overwhelm the influence of monetary policy, so that

even a sudden change in policy, if expected, will have no real effect on

the economy. Sometimes simply, but not quite accurately, called "rational
expectations," this view implies that a dramatically quick disinflation
could be achieved without recession, and also that monetary policy is in-

effective in stabilizing output and employment. The other view, which I
will refer to here as the "Keynesian" view, is that expectations matter
little, either because they are exogenous, or because people are backward—

looking and do not adjust to expectations of policy change. This view is
embodied in most econometric models now used for policy evaluation in

practice. It implied that unemployment could be permanently reduced by
an increase in inflation, and more recently that accommodative monetary

policies could prevent recessions by tolerating negligible and temporary

increases in inflation)

—2—

The main theme of this paper is that both these views are incorrect

and can be seriously misleading to policy—makers. In developing this theme,
I will review some of the criticism which has been raised against these
two views, and also attempt to advance a new view of the role of expectations

that is emerging from current research. I argue that the new view offers policy—
makers a promising alternative to the other two views. This new view recognizes
that infrequently—changed contractual and institutional arrangements are an
important part of the workings of a modern economy, but that forward—looking
expectations influence how these arrangements are set up, and how they adjust

over time. Expectations cannot be ignored, but neither can the wage and

price setting mechanisms through which the economy adjusts. Since this
alternative view mixes elements of both the Keynesian and new classical

schools, there is a sense in which it is a compromise or consensus view. It
would be inaccurate for me to characterize it this way, however, for strong
criticism of the approach has already emerged from proponents of both the

Keynesian and new classical macroeconomics. In general, the approach has
lead to policy implications that are quite unlike either the Keynesian or

new classical prescriptions. For some questions, the answers seem closer to
those of the Keynesians. For others, the answers seem closer to the new
classicals. Perhaps more importantly, the approach has also generated
econometric policy evaluation models for monetary policy that are quite

different from those appearing in earlier work on rational expectations or

used by Keynesian economists today. These developments are described below.
In discussing these views, it will be useful to narrow the focus on

two objectives of monetary policy. One is the short—run objective of
disinflation ——

bringing

the rate of inflation down to a lower level —— which

is of central concern in the U.S. and other countries today. The other is

—3—

the long—run objective of keeping the rate of inflation near this new lower
level, while at the same time stabilizing the fluctuations of unemployment

and output. Of course, this short—run versus long—run dichotomy is

artificial. Indeed, expectations about the success of achieving the long—
run goal have implications for success in the short—run goal; if people
expect a resurgence of inflation soon after the economy recovers from a
disinflation, then the disinflation process itself will be more disruptive
as these expectations prevent the adjustment of interest rates and other

prices

The paper proceeds as follows. First, I present a brief historical
overview of recent research on expectations in macroeconomics. An attempt
is made to outline the general implications of the empirical work which has

aimed to test the new classical macroeconomic view. I then go on to review
the theoretical and empirical research which underlies the new approach to

expectations advanced here. Several theoretical models using this approach
were introduced independently by different researchers in the mid—l970's and

have already been extended in a number of directions. Empirical work began
later, but is. now being pursued at the micro and macro levels. Testing of
the newer approach is still underway.
Second, I review a number of criticisms of the new approach that have been

raised by Keynesian and new classical economists. Some of the criticisms
have resulted from semantic confusions, but most are substantive and require
careful consideration.

Third, I illustrate, using some of my own research, how the new approach
leads to workable empirical policy evaluation models that answer questions

about the role of expectations. Though these expectations models are still
under development, actual policy simulations are useful for assessing their

—4—

potential as a policy evaluation tool. Using a quantitative model of union
wage setting in the U.S., the maximum speed of disinflation which can occur
without a recession is calculated under alternative assumptions about
indexing and about the composition of contracts in the U.S. labor force.

For these calculations, expectations are assumed to be rational. Deviations
from rationality caused either by credibility problems or by difficulties in

learning about policy would require further adjustment. Despite rational expectations, the speed is considerably slower than that implied by a new classical view.
Disinflating more quickly than the speed calculated here would cause a

recession. The results of this simulation are then compared with the results
of the current disinflation effort in the U.S. In addition to showing how
the new view of expectations generates conclusions which are quite different
from Keynesian and new classical models, these simulations are suggestive of
some of the credibility problems that arise during the transition period of

a disinflation. They also illustrate how policy evaluation of such substantive
issues might proceed quantitatively.

In the final section I consider some of the long—run issues. Though the
new approach indicates that quick short—run disinflation efforts are likely to
be costly in terms of recession, it also suggests that a long—run policy of
less accommodation to inflation than experienced in the U.S. in the 1970's,
can lead to price stability, and while not eliminating business cycle

fluctuations entirely, can keep them reasonably small. The choice of how
accommodative policy should be is ultimately a value judgement. But the
claim that a less accoimnodative policy could eventually lead to a relatively

attractive position on the tradeoff between output and price stability, relies

heavily on the role of expectations. The simulations and more general

—5—

arguments that show that a costly disinflation —— such as the one we are now
observing ——

is

not inconsistent with endogenous forward—looking expectations,

are therefore an important part of the case for less accommodative policies.

I. MONETARY ECONOMICS AND RATIONAL EXPECTATIONS: AN OVERVIEW.
It is now over ten years since an explicit method of analyzing
endogenous or consistent expectations was introduced to macroeconomics
under the name rational expectations.2

The original motivation came

from the research of Edmund Phelps and Milton Friedman which had uncovered an important difference between the long—run and the short—run
in the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.3

Focusing on

the Phillips curve——the graphical characterization of the short—term
procyclical behavior of prices and wages observed for over a hundred
years——Phelps and Friedman showed how simple economic principles would

be violated if the curve was extrapolated to the long—run: a permanent
increase in inflation would not lead to a permanent increase in produc-

tion. Their explanation was, of course, based on expectations. The
short—run stimulating effects associated with a rise in prices and the
depressing effects associated with a fall in prices could not last in the

long—run. Firms and workers would come to expect these movements and

adjust their behavior accordingly. The fact that the Phelps—Friedman prediction
seemed to come true so vividly in the 1970's, clearly sheds serious doubt on

the view that expectations are exogenous. But while the Phelps—Friedman theory
was explicit about the long—run, it was only sketchy about what caused the
short—run business cycle correlations which generated Phillips' original
regression estimates.
The new classical macroeconomics
In introducing rational expectations to the problem Robert Lucas had
the main objective of developing a detailed theory of the short—run process
which was as explicit as the Phelps—Friedman theory about the long—run.
Such detail——however abstract and technical——is of course necessary for

quantitative policy analysis and for empirical work. The models introduced

—7—

by Lucas are explicit about many things in addition to expectations. They
are explicit that prices and wages are perfectly flexible and that markets

clear at every date. And they are explicit that the mechanism generating
the inflation—unemployment correlations is information—based: confusion
about relative versus aggregate price movements cause firms to produce
more and hire more workers when the aggregate price level rises.

This is

not an implausible theory and it certainly fits the longer—run facts of
inflation and unemployment better than the pre—Phelps—Friedman inflation—

unemployment tradeoff. The basic idea has been extended and used in many
other applications.5
Because this theory had been laid out so explicitly, it has been
possible to test the hypothesis and the predictions in many different ways,
and indeed an enormous research effort has gone into performing such tests.

Although the evidence seemed favorable at first, this effort has recently
begun to uncover serious problems about the empirical validity of the
informational—based Phillips curve, at least for the U. S. in much of

the post—war period. Sargent (1976) found only weak explanatory power
from unanticipated price movements, and Fair (1979) found that the effects

were insignificant in the 1950's and 1960's, and of the wrong sign in
the 1970's. Barro's (1977b) empirical work which focused on unanticipated
money rather than prices seemed more consistent with the theory, but
later work has shown the results to be sensitive to variations in the

assumptions. Most recently, for example, Mishkin (1982) has shown that
anticipated money matters as much or more than unanticipated money. Perhaps, more bothersome is the empirical work by Barro and Hercowitz (1980)
and Boschen and Grossman (1981) that misperceived money changes, as
distinct from unanticipated money changes, do not stimulate production

as the misperceptions model suggests they should. Another problem is
the finding of Hercowitz (1980) that unanticipated money has little

—8—

association with price dispersion as predicted by the information—based
models.

6

More recent attempts to demonstrate the validity of the new classical
macroeconomics are Thomas Sargent's (1980, 1981) widely—publicized studies
of historical examples of quick disinflation efforts in different countries.

These examples are meant to show that instantaneous adjustment is at least

possible. Sargent documents how the central European hyperinflations in
the early 1920's ended very abruptly once budget reforms were put in place,
and although recessions frequently accompanied or followed these disinflations

they might be attributed to other sources. Garber (1982) has examined the
recession following the German hyperinflation in detail, and considers

whether it was directly due to the disinflation. One problem, of course,
with hyperinflation examples is that most contractual or institutional
rigidities break down during a hyperinflation (presumably to the detriment of
microeconomic efficiency); hence there are no barriers to quick price and

wage adjustment. Such examples do not seem relevant to more moderate
inflations which have persisted for several years and where contractual
rigidities have remained.

Recognizing this criticism Sargent has also examined the experience
of France in 1926 when the Poincare government was elected with a broad
mandate to institute budget reforms and stop the inflation which had
persisted since World War I.

Sargent shows that this more moderate

inflation did stop abruptly after fiscal reforms were instituted, but
does not examine the effects on the real economy.
In the upper panel of Figure 1 a plot of the wholesale price index
in France during 1919—1927 is shown along with a measure of the money

—9—

supply.. In the bottom panel detrended industrial production is shown.
It is clear from Figure 1 that a recession did accompany the disinflation
which began in the surmner of 1926 when the Poincare government came to

power. Industrial production did not return to trend levels until more
than two years after the disinflation began, after which it continued to
rise for another year before the start of the great depression.
In fact the Sergent committee,which was set up in 1926 to recommend

measures to end the French inflation,warned that such a recession would

be likely. The experience with disinflation only six years earlier (again
see Figure 1) was probably enough to worry the committee. Ralph Hawtrey,
a firm believer in endogenous expectations (see Hicks (1969)), wrote a
paper in 1932 on the French disinflation which had the main purpose of
showing that the French return to gold in 1926 was ultimately a major

cause of the great depression. More important for our purposes was that
he was puzzled that the disinflation did not lead to an even larger reces-

sion. His explanation was that nominal wages had lagged so far behind
prices in 1925 and early 1926, that the real wage was very low throughout

much of the period of disinflation. In addition he argued that much of
the decline in aggregate demand which the monetary crunch generated was
reflected in a decline in imports because the Franc was pegged at a level

that made foreign goods very expensive by historical purchasing power
standards.

It seems clear that some evidence that the recession following the
French disinflation was due to other causes is necessary before we can be
confident that the market—clearing perfectly flexible wage modei is

adequate to describe that situation. This reconsideration of the
facts seems to suggest that the French disinflation

—10—

is more consistent with the contract—based expectations models, than with
the information—based models.

The similarity between the flexible—price, market—clearing, assumptions of the information—based models and the assumptions of the "classical"
economists such as Pigou, from whom Keynes and Keynesians are separated,
has led to the term "new classical macroeconomics" to refer to these models.
In fact a proliferation of names has arisen to describe these models in
the many reviews in the literature:

"monetarism mark II," "rational expectations with misperceptions," "the

hard—line approach," and "the competitive market approach." All these
terms are synonymous with the new classical macroeconomics which features
market—clearing, flexible—prices, and information—based explanations of
the Phillip's curve.

A New Approach
At about the same time that the Lucas information—based theory was
being tested and extended, a new approach to the same Phillip's curve
policy issues was being developed by another group of researchers.1°
This new approach relied heavily on the techniques and ideas developed in

the new classical research, and was motivated by the same aims: to improve
quantitative policy evaluation in macroeconomics.11

But rather than

describing price movements using the market—clearing assumptions, these
models contain explicit mechanisms to describe how prices (or wages) are

determined. Recall that in the information—based models the working
assumption is that there are no long—term contracts which set nominal
wages or prices beyond a market—clearing period.12

The new models

are contract—based in that there is a finite period of time when a nominal

wage or price is set and transactions are assumed to take place at that

—11—

price. There is no presumption that a formal contract is involved; nominal
wages or prices could be set as part of an informal arrangement. These
models give rise to a quite different mechanism for price and output
fluctuations than those introduced by Lucas, and their properties and

policy implications are much different. One difference which has attracted
some attention is that anticipated and perceived changes in the money

supply can affect output and employment. Tests of these models are not yet
at the advanced stage of the tests of the information—based models. It is
not yet clear that the contract—based models will need relatively minor
revision, complete overhaul or replacement.13
In the terminology of this paper, these models are not "Keynesian't in

that expectations are not exogenous or purely hackward—looking While there
are of course expectational errors in these models, the expectations mechanism
is endogenous and generally consistent with the economic events described by

the models. But the most essential feature of these models is that the sticky
prices are forward—looking; price and wage setting is anticipatory and expectations

of future events matter for current wage and price decisions. This is not
true either of fixed (for all time) prices, nor of exogenous but moving
prices, nor even of the "tatonnement" prices which react to the current state

of excess demand but are backward—looking. In the new kind of models, it is
assumed that labor unions and corporations adjust their nominal wage bargaining
to expectations about future wage, price, and demand conditions.

It may be helpful to think of this new forward—looking aspect of wage
and price setting in terms of another type of decision which brings

—12—

with it future commitments: capital investment. The economic aspects
of a decision to set an hourly wage rate or a weekly salary are not unlike

a decision to buy capital equipment. The useful life of business equipment is not much longer than the 3—year life of the typical labor union

contract. A wage decision has implications for the firm's profits via the
expectations of other wages, the prices of other inputs, the price of out-

put, and the state of demand. Similarly, a worker's expected return from
working under a set nominal wage is affec.ted by expectations of price and

the wages of other workers. Moreover, if demand conditions are expected
to be high during the contract period, the terms of the bargain might
be tilted in the worker's direction.
The forward—looking aspects of wage and price decisions do not

eliminate the problem of slow or gradual adjustment when conditions change.
Because wage decisions have a finite duration, actions taken in the past

have implications for today. Again the analogy with capital is helpful.
Equipment purchased in the past affects the actual capital stock today,
and hence influences the demand for new equipment given a desired capital

stock tomorrow. Hence, while decisions are made by looking at the future,

there is an implicit but necessary lement of backward—looking. The
persistence generated by past wage decisions can be quite drawn out if
wage contracting is nonsynchronized or staggered and wages are set taking
expectations of other wages into account.

—13—

II. RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE NEW VIEW OF EXPECTATIONS

A number of criticisms of the contract—based expectations models have
recently been raised .

Before presenting empirical illustrations of how

these models might be used in practice, some reaction to these criticisms

is in order. We consider three criticisms here (1) price and especially
wage decisions are not forward—looking, (2) contracts which set a fixed
nominal wage and let demand determine employment at that wage are not
optimal, and (3) contract length is endogenous and will adjust when the
policy rule changes.

Forward—looking. Okun (1981) argued that wage contracts would not
be forward—looking because "forecasting the wages of other firms is
complex and costly," and because communicating the forecast to workers
would be difficult.

The costs of gathering information to make forecasts raises questions

about optimization in general. Firms need to forecast future demand for
their products and because of long lead times in designing new facilities,

being as accurate as possible in such forecasts has large payoffs. Why
should it be more costly to forecast future wages, than to forecast other

variables? In fact, well developed wage surveys are now available on
a current basis to assist firms in this process. Many of these surveys

provide information about wages over the next year or more. Communicating
forecasts of future wages in competing industries, or future prices and
demand conditions, may be difficult in the adverse surroundings of a

collective bargaining negotiation. There is an obvious advantage to the
firm to convince the workers that the prevailing wage and price level will

—14—

be lower during the contract period, than the firm actually is forecasting.
But for precisely this reason, most unions do not rely on the internal

forecasts of firms. They either hire their own economic forecasters or
insist that the negotiations be based on a consensus economic forecast
coming from the major private forecasting firms.
Testing for forward—looking behavior is very difficult because
any forecast of the future must be based on what is observable4

However,

some criticism may be due to semantic confusion. Forward—looking in the
contract—based models usually means only that future variables, like next

year's prevailing cage, are important for the wage decision. This in itself seems unobjectionable: if the prevailing wage is expected to be $10
an hour then the wage settlement will obviously be less than if the pre-

vailing wage is expected to be $20 per hour. However, the models also
assume that the forward—looking is accomplished by rational forecasting.
This does need further testing, and is likely to be more accurate during
normal times with recurrent events than when the structure of the economy
is changing quickly.

Inefficient Contracts. In an influential paper Barro (1977a) argued
that the contract—based macro models rely on contracts which are inefficient.

In Barro's words: "The crucial element and the aspect that accurately
marks this approach as 'non—market—clearing' analysis——is the nonexecution
of some perceived mutually advantageous trades (where trades may include

side payments). In the context of voluntary exchange on spot markets, it
would not generally be possible to exhaust all perceived mutually advan-

tageous trades unless all prices were 'flexible.' However, long—term
contracts [of the Azariadis (1975) variety] permit a separation between

—15—

mutually advantageous exchange and short—run price flexibility ——

it becomes

possible to retain the former while abandoning the latter."
Barro is correct in arguing that the early micro—theoretic work on
implicit contracts implies efficient arrangements between firms and workers.

More recent work based on moral hazard and asymetric information summarized
by Hall (1980), has shown that these contracts can lead to inefficiencies,
but these are not of the type that fixed nominal wage contracting generates

for the economy as a whole. All the implicit contract research has been
conducted in real terms (that is, explaining why the real wage is rigid)

while most macroeconomic inefficiencies can be traced to sticky nominal wages.
As Fischer (1977b) noted in response to Barro, however, contracts in
the real world resemble very closely the contracts assumed in the contract—

based macro models. This response should not be taken lightly. At the least,
it implies that microeconometric work using contract data is feasible. It also
suggests that a better way to model market adjustment might be through the

use of such contracts, rather than through explicit market—clearing. Market—
clearing models offer no explanation of how the market—clearing price is

determined. Perhaps forward—looking wage and price setting rules are
efficient ways for markets to "clear" when the economy—wide wage price vector

cannot be called out. But this is an unsettled issue at this time.
There is a type of inefficiency which develops at the macro level
when we consider that the economy adjusts through the interaction or many

individual contracts between firms and workers, It is easiest to see this
inefficiency by supposing that the contracts are designed to guarantee small

movements in relative wages, rather than real wages. The optimal contracts
call for reduced work when demand at the firm is low, and more work when
demand at the firm is high, as part of this relative wage guarantee.

In the aggregate, such contracts generate a nominal wage rigidity.

—16--

Suppose there is a drop in the money supply. Real balances
measured in terms of wages will fall, interest rates will rise and there

will be a slump in demand. According to each of the micro contracts
there will be a drop in employment. Eventually a series of relative wage
adjustments will bring about a fall in the nominal wage and demand will

rise again. This simple description is not unlike the mechanism which
underlies the contract—based explanation of the positive correlation between

nominal variables and real variables. The details of the adjustment depend
on the length of the contracts, how sensitive new negotiations are to demand
conditions, and on the degree of forward—looking.

Endogenous Contract Length. Lucas and Sargent (1978) have raised doubts
about the contract models because they assume that contract length would not

adjust when economic conditions change. Similarly, indexing provisions in

the contract might change. This criticism is also correct. But in most
contract—based expectations models the assumption is made for convenience,
and sensitivity analysis can be done to see how the results might be affected

by changing the contract length. Recent work by Parkin (1982) based on
earlier work by Mussa (1977) and others has carefully developed the micro—
economic foundations of one of the contract—based models, and can relate

contract length to adjustment cost parameters.15 Empirical evidence, however,
suggests that while contract length does vary over time, the changes are

gradual and not obviously related to policy changes. Evidently, the costs of
negotiation are still quite high relative to the gains for individual firms
or union groups from more frequent negotiations.

III. THE ROLE OF EXPECTATIONS DURING DISINFLATION
Calculating the right speed of deceleration of the money supply——
or one step removed, nominal GNP——during a planned disinflation, is a
difficult but extremely important problem for monetary policymakers.
Treating expectations correctly is clearly crucial for such a calculation.
The new classical macroeconomic models suggest that the rate of disinflation can be quite rapid——with no harmful side—effects——if only the
decline in money growth is made credible enough.17

With no contracts

or sticky prices, expectations of future inflation can be brought down
instantaneously, and the economy—wide wage—price vector can be stopped

abruptly according to these models. The Keynesian approach, as I have
characterized it here and as it is embodied in most econometric models,
cannot deal with the expectations question systematically, since the
expectations mechanisms are backward—looking.

Preliminary quantitative models incorporating the theoretical ideas
of the new approach to macroeconomic expectations described here, can be

used to address such questions. It will be helpful to illustrate this type
of analysis with an example, and for this purpose I used a model of union wage

contracting that I have recently studied (see Taylor (1982)).

The model

is oriented to detailed contract data of the major union sector of the U.S.

and might be used to answer the following question: Assuming that
expectations are rational, that the monetary deceleration program is
credible, and that there are no anticipated relative wage adjustments

necessary, what is the maximum rate of deceleration of nominal wages
which can occur without an increase in unemployment?

The answer to

this question can then be used to calculate the maximum rate of

money growth reduction which can be obtained without a recession.
The deceleration cannot be too fast because with long term

—18—

contracts and deferred increases, there will be an overhang of predeter-

mined nominal wages. Hence, a quick deceleration will result in a reduction in real money balances which will tighten credit markets, raise

interest rates, lower demand, and increase unemployment. Gradualist
proposals for moderate decelerations are sometimes based on such arguments.
But quantitative estimates of what gradual reductions mean in terms of
money growth statistics would certainly seem helpful.

The calculations described in Taylor (1982) are based on the assumption that the major union sector dominates nominal wage movements in the

U. S. economy. That assumption is certainly open to dispute since
unionized workers only constitute about one—fifth of the labor force in

the U. S. Implicit in these calculations is that the nominal wages of
all other workers are simply indexed to the effective wage in the major

union sector. The results reported here consider a modification of that
assumption, by assuming that all other workers in the economy set their
nominal wages for one year, and are fully integrated with the union

sector. That is, unionized workers and their employers keep track of the
wages of non—unionized workers, and visa versa. One would expect that,
since the average contract length of the union sector is much larger
than the one—year period we assume for the non—union sector, this modification would permit a faster deceleration.

Table 1 reports the results of the simulations, Starting from an
inherited steady inflation of 10 percent, the simulations assume that
an announced monetary disinflation begins in year 1 and that the new target

inflation rate is 3 percent. The maximum rate of deceleration consistent
with continued real growth of employment and output is shown in the Table

—19—

for four different assumptions. In the first column it is assumed that
there is no indexing and that the major union sector leads. This corresponds to the simulations reported in my earlier work.

Clearly the rate

of deceleration is quite slow for the first two years, when it begins to

fall off rapidly. With 30 percent indexing of the two and three year
contracts the deceleration is only a bit faster. The assumption on
indexing——that there are only annual escalator adjustments with no
adjustments in the first year——is perhaps more sluggish than in reality.
Alternative results are reported in the third and fourth columns of
Table 1 where the rate of deceleration of wages is calculated for the

entire labor force. As one would expect, here the deceleration is more
pronounced in the first year, and wage growth comes down quite rapidly

in the second and third years. Again with indexing, inflation comes down

more quickly, but the differences are minor. The details of each settlement for workers signing contracts of different lengths is presented in

Tables 2 through 5. These represent the kinds of union settlements one
should expect during a rationally expected disinflation. Note that the
deferred increases in the third year of the three year contracts are
down significantly even during the early stages of the disinflation.
According to these results, if velocity is constant in terms of the

nominal wage'9 then money growth should not be reduced any more quickly
than the columns in Table 1. Taking the best case, with the non—union
workers interacting with the union workers and with indexing, the rate
of decline in money growth is gradual but it speeds up as the disinflation

continues and then slows down again: 1 percent in the first year, 2—1/2
percent in the second year, 3 percent in the third year, and 1/2 percent

in the fourth year. Taking the least optimistic calculation, the decline

—20—

is negligible in the first year, almost 1 percent in the second year, a
whopping 5 percent in the third year, and 1 percent in the fourth year.
In both cases the deceleration takes about four years.

Keeping with the same expectational assumption, these results
indicate that a faster decline in wage growth than presented in these

tables will cause a recession. It needs to be emphasized, however, that

these expectational assumptions might be too optimistic. We suspect that
rational expectations is a reasonable assumption for recurrent events, but

for unique events it is more suspect. Moreover, the relatively small
reduction in money growth at the start of the disinflation could raise
credibility about future reductions in money growth and cast further
doubt on the rational expectations assumption.

What do these calculations imply about the role of expectations com-

pared with the new classical and Keynesian models? Relative to the new
classical models, which under the same expectational assumptions suggest
that wage inflation could drop from 10 percent to 3 percent in the first

quarter, the results are quite different. This approach suggests that
such a drop would cause a large recession. But relative to the backward—
looking Keynesian models the results are different as well. These models
suggest that steady full—employment, implicit in the simulation paths in

Tables 1 through 5,would not reduce inflation at all. According to those
models inflation would still be at 10 percent at the end of 5 years if
there was no increase in unemployment.

It is helpful to compare the results of such simulations with money

wage growth during the current disinflation. In Table 6 various measures
of wage inflation are presented for the recent period. In all cases the

—21—

measures of inflation are rates of change from one quarterly average to

the next, measured at annual rates as in the model simulations. Wage
disinflation began in the first quarter of 1981 according to the average
hourly earnings index adjusted for overtime and inter—industry shifts.
Since then, wage inflation has fallen from near 10 percent to about 6—1/2

percent in 1—1/2 years. Comparing this path with the columns in Table 1
indicates that this deceleration was faster than could be sustained while

maintaining full employment, especially in the first year. Hence, according
to this very preliminary comparison, the high unemployment rates we have
experienced during this disinflation are consistent with this type of ex-

pectations model.2° The extra reduction in wage inflation could be resulting
either from unemployment—induced concessions (early negotiations) or attempts
to bid down relative wages.

IV. THE ROLE OF EXPECTATIONS AND ACCOMMODATION OF INFLATION
The snap—shot view of a disinflation in the simulations of the previous

section leaves two important questions unanswered. First, how did we get
to the double digit inflation rates at which these disinflation simulations

start? Second, how do we prevent a return to higher inflation after the
disinflation ends? The answer to these difficult questions must center
around the old question of what causes the monetary authorities to increase
the rate of growth of money and credit which makes episodes of inflation

possible. Clearly this question has not been settled by economists, but the
answer, at least for most modern developed economies where revenue from
money creation representsa trivial portion of government tax receipts,
must have to do with the accommodation or validation of inflation.

The new classical macroeconomistE view the accommodation issue
solely in terms of accommodating the

rate of inflation. The

clearest exposition is in Barro and Gordon (1981). The monetary authorities
will suboptimally validate inflation according to this view because people

expect them to. If they stop validating, then an unexpected and misperceived drop in money growth causes a drop in production because suppliers
are misperceived into thinking only their own wages and prices have fallen

relative to expectations. A recession then develops. As these models
indicate, a socially preferred solution would be for policymakers not to

accommodate at all. However, this view is dependent on the mispercep—
tions mechanism being an accurate model. The research discussed in
section I sheds doubt on this for the U. S.
The Keynesian view of accommodation is that if the monetary authorities
do not validate exogenous increases in prices——such as OPEC, large wage

—23—

bargains, or agricultural shocks ——

then a recession will develop. As

reviewed in the mid—1950's by Haberler: "If monetary policy does stand
firm [is not accommodative], wages (or some wages) will be pushed up

anyway. As a consequence unemployment will appear and the monetary authorities
are then confronted with the dilemma either to 'create' a certain amount of
unemployment or to tolerate at least from time to time a rise in the price

level." Events in the 1970's might indicate that the last sentence should
finish with "inflation rate" rather than "price level." In any case, the
Keynesian models are still giving the same answers to these questions.
Although the Phillips curve has been augmented, the expectations effect of
an accommodative policy on wage and price behavior, once it becomes expected,
has been ignored.
Some of the contract—based rational expectations models have been designed

especially to address this accommodation issue. In these models the issue
is not only whether expectations should be validated as in the new classical
models, but also whether the existing contracted trend in wages and

prices should be validated. Because both factors must be considered the
answer is more complex than with either of the other two views of expectations.
It should be noted however, that the rational expectations assumption is
probably more accurate for such issues than for the question of a one—time
disinflation, because many price and wage shocks are recurrent phenomena.
Because these models have both the inertia of sticky prices and
expectations, one might expect that a compromise amount of accommodation

would be implied ——

less

accommodation than the Keynesian models but more

than the new classicals. The issue here is a quantitative one. Research with
some empirical models with contracts and rational expectations suggests that the
answer might be a lot closer to the new classical than to the Keynesians.21
Clearly more empirical work can and should be done.

—24—

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In

this discussion of the role of expectations for monetary policy,

I have emphasized what I feel are serious empirical problems with both
the new classical and Keynesian macroeconomics, and I have tried to describe
the general features of a new approach which I feel can provide an improve-

ment. The new approach combines elements of both views, but as evidenced
by serious criticism of the approach from proponents of these views, it
is not a compromise view let alone a synthesis of these views.

The quantitative policy implications of the new approach which I

outlined ——

that

a very gradual and expected monetary deceleration could reduce

inflation without disrupting real growth, that such a gradual deceleration
raises serious credibility problems in its early phases, that a sudden
disinflation would cause a big recession, even if expected, and that less

accommodation r inflation in the future is a move in the right direction ——

are meant to be examples of how the approach can be applied to policy problems.
Other researchers using these methods have drawn and will continue to draw

their own conclusions. But in emphasizing differences between this new
approach, and that of the new classicals and the Keynesians it is impossible

to hide the similarities. In particular the new approach owes much to the
innovative empirical and theoretical methodology introduced by the new

classical macroeconomics. As Tobin (1981) has recently written, "The ideas
of the [new classical macroeconomics] are too distinctive and powerful to

be lost in the shuffle. They are bound to shape whatever orthodoxy emerges."

1.

Some brief discussion of the reasons for my calling these two views

Unew classical" and "Keynesian" is probably in order. The terminology
is not entirely satisfactory because these names have been used in other

contexts and have many connotations. However, the term "new classical
macroeconomics" seems appropriate because it has already been used by
Lucas and Sargent (1978) and others in reviewing macroeconomic developments, and because it emphasizes a similarity with the classical economists
who frequently relied on the flexible—price market—clearing assumptions.
Usage of the term "rational expectations" to refer to this view, though
widespread, is inaccurate because rational expectations methods have
been used

in other contexts, as will be described below. The term

"Keynesian" seems appropriate because Keynes himself emphasized the
random exogeneitv of expectations in Chapter 19 of the General Theory,

and because the major Keynesian econometric models use backward—
looking expectations in their analysis.

-.

See Phillips (1958). Adaptive expectations might explain business cycle

correlations, but some explanation is needed for why people would persistently

adjust their expectations slowly when facing recurrent events. Adaptive expectations are a reasonable assumption following a new event, but to the extent
business cycles are recurrent events this assumption needs further justification.

5. Sargent and Wallace (1975), Barro (1977a) for example. Interesting
applications of these informational concepts to problems in monetary
economics other than the Phillips curve include King (1982), Walsh
(1982), and Weiss(l980).

—26—

Early

worries that the theory

did

not explain the dynamics or persis-

tence of the business cycle were cleared up theoretically by Blinder
and Fischer (1981) and Lucas (1975), by adding other explicit sources

of persistence, such as inventories or other types of capital. However, if the theory has trouble explaining the impulse effect, these
propogation effects have nothing to propogate.

7. Nominal wages were stabilized in 1927, perhaps because the recession
led to distress conditions which broke informal contracts, or perhaps
because depressed demand conditions led to a bidding down of nominal

wages. The nominal wage index for hourly wages in Paris, in the provinces, and in the coal mining industry was as follows (Mitchell (1976)):

for example. Some of the other research which is part of this new approach
is described below. It should also be mentioned that this approach
is being pursued in the open economy macroeconomic field. See Dornbusch
(1982), for example.

—27—

ii. The original motivation for this work was probably the striking

policy ineffectiveness result of Sargent and Wallace (1975). How—
ever, even in the early contract—based papers other issues were raised

about stabilization policy. Phelps and Taylor (1977) for example,
noted that the monetary authorities might have to "penalize the
economy in the short—run for the sake of beneficial system effects."
This possibility which now seems very real could not have occurred
in backward—looking Keynesian models.

12. Perhaps a quarter for the time period in the discrete models is appropriate. This seems to be the shortest time period used in the major

empirical tests of the mod1 (e.g., Barro and Rush (1980) and Sargent
(1976)). If markets are assumed to clear within the quarter, then a
fixed wage which lasts more than one quarter is simply ruled out by
assumption.

13. Tests by Ashenfelter and Card (1982) have found empirical difficulties
with the distributed lag sbape in the more rudimentary contract models.
It is not yet clear whether such problems exist in more realistic
contract models which reflect actual distributions of workers by

different contract lengths. They also find inconsistencies with
cross equation relationships which may be similar to those discussed
by Barro and Rush (1980) for information—based models.

14. McNees (1979) performed tests which seemed to indicate that there
was more backward—looking than forward—looking. On the other hand,
recent work by Meyer and Webster (1982) indicates that forward—
looking predominates.

—28—

15. Blanchard (1981) and Calvo (1982) have recently studied the micro—
economic behavior of profit maximizing firms in a staggered price

setting environment. Buiter and Jewitt (1980) have examined the effects
of different combinations of real versus nominal anticipatory wage

setting, obtaining results useful for sensitivity analysis. Begg
(1982) has also examined the microeconomics of staggered nominal wage
setting.
16.

The length of U. S. major union contracts has not changed very much
in recent years according to the data used in the model described

in Taylor (1982). Christofides and Wilton (1982) have found evidence
of contract length in Canada shortening in 1975 as the variance of

inflation increased. This type of effect is predicted in the models
of Canzoneri (1980) and Gray (1978) where contract length or indexing
is endogenous.
17.

If policy is not credible then the problem is much more difficult.

Sargent (1981) has suggested that the recession which has accompanied
the disinflation in the U. K. may be due to lack of credibility in
that the public sector borrowing requirement was projected to be so

large that inflationary money growth would return in the future.
However, Miller (1980) has shown that the Thatcher government budget
deficits were projected to decline over time if measured on an infla-

tion adjusted basis. Meyer and Webster (1981) have attempted to
approach the credibility problem systematically in models with perfect

price flexibility using Bayesian or least squares learning. Cukierman
(1981) has attempted to incorporate government announcements in measures of credibility.

—29—

18. Such as a reduction in the relative wage of automobile or steel
workers.

19. It would be an easy matter to incorporate a money demand function in
the model and calculate the reduction in velocity which would accompany

the reduction in expected inflation. This reduction in velocity would
imply that money growth would have to be faster during part of the

disinflation period than the growth rates reported in the Tables. If
the real wage is steady then money balances could be deflated by the
price level to get the same results.

20. The effect of the automobile and trucking concessions is seen clearly
in the last entry of the second column of Table 6. No wage adjustment
occurred for the 460,000 workers covered by the auto and trucking
contracts, and these workers moved from the third to the first quarter

for the average computed in Table 6. They represent 70 percent of
the workers negotiating during the first quarter.

21. According to calculations with the empirical models in Taylor (1979)
and Taylor (1980), less accommodative policies than we have experienced

in recent years would appear to be desirable. Blinder (1981) has made similar

theoretical calculations using the Fischer (1977a) model. His results
generally depend on the values of the parameters of the Fischer model.
It is worth stating here that while the new models' answer to the accommodation
issue seems close to the new classicals, the new models also imply that
stabilization policy is effective on real variables which is quite unlike

the new classicals. See Taylor (1981) for further discussion on this point.
