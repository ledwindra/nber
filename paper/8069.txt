INTRODUCTION
After a half-century of extraordinary growth in health care expenditures in the United
States, there is now evidence that health care spending growth is slowing. Why this is
occurring and how long it may last is not known, but a substantial literature suggests that two
key elements of the efforts to contain costs may have played a role: the use of prospective
payment systems (Russell and Manning, 1989) and the encouragement of competition among
providers (Melnick and Zwanziger, 1988). Indeed, the combination of these two approaches
seems to be particularly important, since competition in the absence of prospective payment
systems has been suggested to increase costs (Robinson and Luft, 1985), and prospective
payment in the absence of competition provides no financial incentive to provide quality care.
While most theoretical discussions of the effects of prospective payment hinge on the
incentives to provide lower levels of care under fixed reimbursement and do not discuss the
differential incentives to provide care to different types of patients,1 a few theoretical
examinations of prospective payment have also incorporated the differential incentives for
spending on profitable or unprofitable patients (e.g. Allen and Gertler, 1991; Ellis, 1998).
Meanwhile, a number of empirical studies have examined the differential effects of
prospective payment systems on low and high-cost patients. For example, Ellis and McGuire
(1996) show how prospective payment for mental health services under Medicaid in New
Hampshire resulted in reduced expenditures selectively among the sickest patients. In the
context of the Medicare Prospective Payment, Newhouse (1989) finds that, while patients in
unprofitable DRGs were not more likely than other patients to be transferred under PPS, they
are more likely to be found in “hospitals of last resort”, suggesting that there is patient

selection according to profitability. Similarly, Meltzer and Chung (2000) show that hospital
spending for the elderly in California under Medicare PPS was selectively reduced among the
most expensive patients. Indeed, these reductions occurred despite an overall pattern among
the young and among the elderly prior to the implementation of Medicare PPS for cost growth
to be greatest among the most expensive patients, as reflected in the increasing concentration
of health care expenditures over this century (Cutler and Meara, 1998). Moreover, Meltzer
and Chung show that this same pattern of selective cost reduction for the most expensive
patients is present within the 12 largest Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs), the categories by
which Medicare reimburses hospitals under PPS.
That prospective payment systems may lead to a redistribution of resources from sick
and costly persons within a payment category to healthier and more profitable ones cuts in
many ways against a fundamental idea behind prospective payment systems in that the
profitable patients are supposed to subsidize the costs of the unprofitable ones. Nevertheless,
competitive pressures could lead to such an outcome as hospitals that attempt to support the
care of unprofitable patients with revenue from profitable patients find the profitable patients
wooed away by other hospitals that have chosen to invest resources in amenities that may
appeal to patients and their doctors, but that are not necessarily related to better outcomes for
the most severely ill.
In this paper, we use California data on patient charges and hospital cost-to-charge
ratios from 1983 and 1993 to explore the effects of competition under prospective payment on
hospital costs for low- and high-cost admissions for the 12 largest Diagnosis Related Groups.
Since the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS) was implemented nationwide almost
simultaneously, we have to identify the effects of PPS mainly through comparison of the

2

effects of competition before and after the implementation of PPS. However, to attempt to
separate out the effects of PPS from temporal changes in the effects of competition, we also
contrast the effects of competition on costs for admissions for persons older than 65 with the
effects of competition on costs for persons younger than 65. Complicating this analysis is the
fact that this period was also a time of important change in the organization and financing of
health care for those below age 65 in California. In particular, the development of a selective
provider contracting program and per-diem reimbursement system by California Medicaid
program (Medi-Cal), and the increasing use of managed care arrangements were important
suppressing hospital cost growth among the young in California over this period.
Although we cannot prove that the patterns we observe are due to Medicare PPS, we
find clear evidence that increased competition was associated with increased costs among the
elderly before the implementation of PPS, but decreased costs afterwards, with the reductions
in costs clearly much greater among high-cost admissions than among low-cost admissions.
This is consistent with the idea that the incentives created by Medicare PPS may have
selectively reduced expenditures on the high-cost elderly.
We begin in Section I with a short overview of the most important cost-containment
efforts prevailing in California during this period: the Medicare Prospective Payment System
(PPS), the California Medicaid selective provider contracting program, and the expansion of
managed care. The description of PPS provides the institutional context for the effects of PPS
we aim to investigate, while the discussion of the changes in reimbursement strategies among
the young provides some insight into the use of the temporal changes in the effects of
competition on costs for the young as a comparison. In Section II, we develop the theoretical
motivation for our analyses using a model of provider response to fixed-rate, prospective

3

reimbursement in which quality can be varied for patients who differ in their underlying
severity of illness and, hence, profitability. In Section III we describe our data, and in Section
IV we present the results of our analyses of the effects of competition on cost. Section V
concludes and examines the implications of our work for the design of reimbursement
strategies, for quality assessment, and for outcomes research.

Section I – Background on Cost-Containment in California, 1983 – 1993
Between 1983 and 1993, diverse cost-containment strategies were undertaken in
California which led to a widespread transition to prospective payment systems as well as
intensified hospital market competition.2 Here, we briefly discuss major cost containment
strategies that were implemented over this period: the Medicare Prospective Payment System
(PPS), selective provider contracting between California’s Medicaid program (Medi-Cal) and
health care providers, and the expansion of managed care arrangements.

Medicare PPS
Prospective payment systems certainly existed prior to the establishment of the
Medicare Prospective Payment System beginning in 1983. Nevertheless, the scale and
influence of Medicare made the shift from retrospective reimbursement on the basis of
reasonable costs to PPS a change of fundamental importance for hospitals. With the
establishment of PPS, reimbursement for almost all hospitalizations under Medicare came to
be made on the basis of prospectively fixed rates according to diagnosis-related groups

(DRGs). Each hospitalization is assigned a DRG based on principal diagnosis or the
performance of a very limited number of particularly costly procedures, such as coronary
artery bypass graft surgery. Each DRG is assigned a fixed weight that reflects its relative cost
of treatment with respect to a base rate. Because hospitals are paid a fixed amount per DRG
based on the DRG weight, the classification system was designed to create groups of patients
as homogeneous as possible with respect to resource consumption. To this end, DRGs were
also stratified with respect to age and the presence of complicating conditions. After a phasein period over the course of four years during which reimbursement reflected a mix of
national, regional, and facility-specific rates (Smith and Fottler, 1985), hospitals were
reimbursed for each case according to the national average cost of treating a base case (with
adjustments to reflect location and local wages) multiplied by the DRG weight (Davis et al.,
1990). Thus, reimbursement under PPS was fully prospective from the onset, but the
persistence of differences in reimbursement rates based on historical costs meant that the
competitive aspects of the effects of PPS increased progressively over its phase-in.

Medi-Cal Selective Provider Contracting
The same year that Medicare PPS was implemented, California enacted legislation
authorizing the state Medicaid program, Medi-Cal, to negotiate contracts with health service
providers for the care of Medi-Cal beneficiaries. This was done with the intent to promote
price competition in the Medicaid market. Under this legislation, eligible, short-term, acutecare general hospitals were offered the opportunity to negotiate service provision contracts
with Medi-Cal on the basis of fixed per-diem rates (Johns, 1985). Failure to secure a contract
meant that hospitals would not be reimbursed for care given to Medi-Cal patients except in

5

cases of emergency (Langa, 1992). Though the per-diem reimbursement established under
this legislation did not result in a fully prospective payment system for Medi-Cal patients, the
resulting declines in Medi-Cal reimbursement also intensified the competitive pressures on
California hospitals during this period.

Expansion of Managed Care
During the 1980s, managed care spread rapidly throughout the U.S., but particularly in
California. By 1988, California ranked first in the nation in terms of its HMO enrollment rate,
with roughly 28.5 percent of the state population (7.68 million individuals) belonging to an
HMO. This was more than double the national enrollment rate in 1987, when only 12.1
percent of the U.S. population was enrolled in an HMO (Davis et al., 1990), and even well
above the national rate of 19.7 percent in 1994 (I.O.M., 1997). Likewise, the number of
Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) in California grew 94 percent from 34 PPOs in 1984
to 72 in 1988 (Johns, 1989).
Some managed care payers adopted prospective payment systems for hospital care
similar to Medicare Prospective Payment. However, the majority adopted other approaches to
cost control such as selective contracting, per diem reimbursement, and utilization review that
did not necessarily provide any particular incentive to decrease expenditures for high cost
users relative to low cost users (Gold et al., 1995)3. Nevertheless, many aspects of managed
care served to further intensify competition in California during these years.
Indeed, the empirical evidence available suggests that Medicare PPS, Medi-Cal
selective contracting and managed care arrangements all contributed to curbing cost growth.
From 1967 to 1984, Medicare hospital care expenditures had been growing at an average

6

annual rate of 16.5 percent: in the seven years immediately following PPS growth fell to 7.3
percent (Davis and Burner, 1995). Based on projections of Medicare expenditures, Russell
and Manning (1989) estimated savings of 12 to 18 billion dollars for 1990 under PPS. MediCal selective contracting in California also appears to have been largely successful in raising
the level of competition in hospital markets while simultaneously suppressing cost growth
(Johns, 1989; Robinson and Phibbs, 1989; Melnick et al., 1992). Additionally, the growth of
managed care organizations also contributed to lower cost growth, both by delivering health
care at lower costs due to lower service intensity (Manning et al., 1984) and by increasing
competition in hospital markets (Melnick and Zwanziger, 1995).
Thus, between 1983 and 1993, hospitals in California became increasingly subject to
prospective payment systems as a result of Medicare PPS, and increased competition due to
the effects of Medi-Cal selective contracting and the growth of managed care. It is in this
context that economic theories of provider behavior under prospective reimbursement suggest
incentives to decrease expenditures on high cost patients while increasing expenditures on
low-cost patients, as we explore below.

Section II - Economic Theories of Provider Behavior under Fixed-Rate Prospective Payment
Systems
Many cost-containment strategies rely on supply-side cost-sharing to achieve costcontainment objectives. Whereas retrospective reimbursement systems largely insulate
providers from increases in costs, providers under prospective payment system are paid a
fixed rate per unit of output defined in advance.

A detailed overview managed care forms can be found in Gold et al., 1995.

If the patient population is taken as given, such payment schemes that hold providers
financially responsible for the marginal costs of treatment can create incentives to reduce
provision of unnecessary services to patients. This is reflected by the common view of
managed care as reducing services. What is less appreciated, however, is that when providers
have to compete for patients, prospective payment systems also create a new distinction
among patients: namely, one between profitable and unprofitable patients depending on their
expected costs relative to the level of prospective reimbursement (Newhouse, 1989). Thus,
when profit-maximizing hospitals under fixed-rate prospective reimbursement face a patient
population of variable illness within a reimbursement category, they may have incentives to
provide excessive levels of care for the less-ill, and/or to choose and advertise quality of care
or amenities that differentially attract these profitable patients while avoiding unprofitable
ones (Hornbrook and Rafferty, 1982; Ellis and McGuire, 1986; Dranove, 1987; Luft and
Miller, 1988; Newhouse, 1989; Hodgkin and McGuire, 1994; Ellis, 1998).4 When intensified
competition decreases overall profit levels and increases the price-responsiveness of patient
volume, such strategies may become matters of institutional survival. Thus, as Ellis (1998)
has shown, incentives to engage in patient selection and discrimination in quality provision
are exacerbated under increased competition, a condition that has been realized in many U.S.
hospital markets in recent years with greater market penetration by managed care
organizations (Ellis, 1998; Dranove and White, 1994).
The empirical implication of these theories is that, where providers are subject to
fixed-rate prospective payment systems, declines in hospital cost growth will be concentrated
4

This may in practice be implemented by increasing spending on infrastructural elements that may be most
important to health patients (such as a pleasant cafeteria or waiting area), and decreasing spending on
infrastrucure that is most important to the sickest patients (such as expensive imaging machines, or intensity of

8

at the top of the spending distribution. In other words, high-cost (unprofitable patients) will
experience greater reductions in resource consumption relative to low-cost (profitable)
patients. Furthermore, these effects will be magnified under competition.
To illustrate this, we develop the following model of choice of quality of care for
patients with differing severity of illness (s) given a prospective payment rate (P).
Specifically, we model the choice of quality of care for patient of severity s (qs) at cost c(qs).
To capture the variation in costs of patients who differ in severity of illness, we allow the cost
of providing basic care to also depend on severity (c(s)). Thus the total cost of caring for a
patient of severity s is c(s) + c(qs), where the first component is non-discretionary and the
second is subject to choice depending on the desire to provide additional quality. Thus we
model the profit from caring for a patient of severity s (π(s)) under prospective payment as:
π(s) = P – c(s) – c(qs) (1)
where:
P

= prospective payment rate

c(s)

= basic cost of caring for patient of severity s (cs > 0, css > 0)

qs

= quality of care provided to patient of severity s

c(qs) = cost of added quality of care to patients of severity s (c(0)=0, cq > 0, cqq > 0)
To go from this patient level-profit to the profit of caring for the class of patients of severity s,
we allow the demand for care by patients of severity s when quality is qs to be D(qs,s)) = D(qs)
(Dq > 0, Dqq < 0). Thus the hospital chooses chooses q(s) to maximize profit:
Max Π (qs ) = D(qs ) [ P − c( s ) − c(qs )]

(2)

qs

ICU care). It might also be implemented by reducing pressure on physicians to rapidly discharge relatively

9

Taking the first order condition with respect to qs, profit maximization results in the condition
that hospitals set the marginal revenue from additional quality equal to the marginal cost:

D '(qs ) [ P − c( s) − c(qs )] − D(qs ) c '(qs ) = 0

(3)

which implies:

[ P − c ( s ) − c ( qs ) ] =
c ( qs )

c '(qs )qs ε c , qs
=
D '(qs )q c(qs )
ε D ,qs

Totally differentiating, and checking the second order conditions demonstrates:

=
< 0 (5)
ds
D '(qs )c '( s)
as long as P-c(s) ≥ 0, and qs = 0 otherwise. Thus discretionary quality falls with severity for
all profitable patients, and is set to zero for all unprofitable patients.

Comparison to retrospective reimbursement
Since one of the empirical comparisons we will make is between prospective
reimbursement and retrospective reimbursement, it is useful to contrast this result with what
would be expected under a retrospective reimbursement system. In particular, instead of a
fixed price P, independent of severity and quality, a retrospective reimbursement system may
in general depend on both (e.g. P(s,qs)). Under some circumstances, this makes the
comparison between prospective and retrospective reimbursement easy, in others it is more
difficult. To illustrate this, assume P(s,qs) takes the general form P(s,qs)= P0 + Ps c(s) + Pq
c(qs), where P0, Ps, and Pq are the rates at which hospital are reimbursed for, respectively the

healthy patients.

basic admission (as in prospective payment), expenditures on severity-related costs, and
expenditures on discretionary dimensions of quality (e.g. amenities). In general, the latter two
categories may be hard to distinguish among in practice, but the distinction is worth making
to reflect the idea that there may be some expenditures that might not be fully covered under a
retrospective reimbursement system, but nevertheless desired by hospitals in order to attract
patients.5 For our purposes, the most straightforward case is when reimbursement provides a
fixed amount of profit per admission by providing a lump sum profit (K) per admission and
exactly reimburses severity-related costs while not covering quality-related costs. In that
case, P0=K>0, ps=1 and pq=0, so Equation 4 becomes [K-c(qs)]/c(qs)=

ε c ,q
and quality is
ε D ,q
s

s

independent of s. In this case, the shift to prospective payment would be expected to decrease
spending for more expensive patients relative to less expensive ones.
Perhaps even more relevant is the case in which retrospective reimbursement provides
no fixed profit per admission but instead offers a markup over costs for severity-related costs,
e.g. P0=0, Ps>1, and Pq=0. In this case, equation 4 becomes [Psc(s)- c(s)-c(qs)]/c(qs)=

ε c ,q
,
ε D ,q

and

dqs
> 0 . Thus, with Ps>1, hospitals make more profit on more expensive patients and
ds

therefore will spend more on quality for the more expensive patients. Again, the switch to
prospective payment will lead to a reduction in spending among the sicker patients.
Finally, it is also worth considering a system in which no fixed profit per admission is
given but all costs related to both severity and quality are reimbursed retrospectively with a
markup. Some might consider this most like the retrospective reimbursement system as it
5

The classic example of this is are the free car seats sometimes offered to expectant parents in order to attract

applied prior to prospective payment. In this case, P0=0, Ps = Pq>1 and equation 4 becomes
[Psc(s) + Pqc(qs)- c(s)-c(qs)]/c(qs) = [(Ps –1) (c(s)+c(qs))]/c(qs) =

ε c ,q

This is would seem to suggest again that quality would rise with severity. It is misleading,
however, because with full retrospective reimbursements for amenities, the hospital has no
incentive to limit expenditures on amenities so the second order conditions actually imply that
the optimal quality is infinite for all patients. Thus, there must be some other constraint on
the reimbursement of discretionary care, which seems most likely to be a combination of the
possibility of doing harm to the patient (and associated risk of liability), and whatever limits
are placed by the payer. Whichever is the case, it is not possible how to predict prospective
payment will affect discretionary expenditures on low- and high-cost patients.
Summarizing, except in the case where discretionary expenditures are not limited by
economic incentives, there appears to be a fairly broad set of assumptions under which
prospective payment would be expected to selectively reduce expenditures for the most
expensive patients relative to retrospective reimbursement.

Effects of Competition
Equation 4 implies that that the ratio of profit to cost for quality falls with increasing
elasticity of demand with respect to quality so that, accordingly, quality rises with increasing
elasticity of demand with respect to quality. Since the out-of-pocket cost of a hospitalization
to a Medicare patient is independent of the hospital they choose, it seems likely that
competitive pressures will make this elasticity be quite large, though such competitive forces
will surely be limited by geographic factors in areas where there are few hospitals so that
them to deliver their child at a particular hospital.

patient options are limited because of high search and transportation costs and where changes
in quality are more likely to be coordinated (Stigler 1968; Bain 1951; Tirole 1988; White
1972).6 Rearranging Equation 4 to solve for c(qs) yields:

Since quality is set to a minimum for unprofitable patients, this applies where patients
are profitable so the numerator is positive, and quality for profitable patients rises with the
degree of competition. As above, quality falls with increasing severity, and here the rate at
which expenditures on quality fall with increasing severity is seen to rise with increasing
elasticity of demand with respect to quality (e.g. competition) so that the positive effect of
competition on costs is reduced for more costly patients. Thus, an increasingly competitive
environment under prospective payment has the effect of raising quality most for the least
costly patients. Since competition under prospective payment may also increase efficiency,
this may not result in an absolute increase in costs, but should at least lessen cost decreases
for the least expensive patients relative to the most costly patients, for whom the clear
incentive is to reduce expenditures if possible because they are not profitable. Indeed, in the
limit, as the elasticity of demand with respect to quality approaches infinity, expenditures on
quality fall dollar-for-dollar with increasing severity of illness as all profits are competed
away at each level of severity.

6

Note however, that the relationship between competition and quality in general may be much more complex
than this in settings where both price and quantity may be varied because it will also depend on the
complementarity between quantity and quality (Spence, 1975; Saving, 1982). Another alternative view is
reflected in Satterthwaite (1979), in which an increasing number of sellers in a market effectively raises search
costs by decreasing the value of information held by any individual about a particular seller.

Section III - DATA AND METHODS
Data Description
Cost and Financial Data
We use the 1983 and 1993 hospital discharge and financial data released for public use
by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD). The
financial data is described in detail below. The discharge data cover all inpatient discharges
from every licensed, non-federal hospital in California, as well as discharges from some
specialized facilities such as psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation, and nursing facilities. Data
elements available for each patient abstract in the public use files include: facility identifiers,
patient’s age, zip code of patient’s residence, expected source of payment, total charges
incurred during the hospitalization episode, and patient’s Diagnosis Related Group
classification (DRG). Additional data for calculating per capita spending and utilization rates
come from the U.S. Bureau of the Census Intercensal Population Estimates by Age, Sex, and
Race (U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, 1993, 1998).
We limit our analysis to all California State residents (identified by zip code)
discharged from acute-care facilities for which data on total hospital charges are available.
Certain institutions, many of which are managed care facilities such as Kaiser hospitals, do
not report total charges on their discharge abstracts because they are exempt from standard
OSHPD accounting procedures. As a convention, patients discharged from these hospitals
have zero charges recorded in their abstracts, although true costs were non-zero. Since total

14

hospital charges for these patients can not be ascertained, they are excluded from our
analyses.7
To calculate costs, we begin with charge data that we convert to 1993 constant dollars
using the general Consumer Price Index and then to costs using an annual institution-specific
ratios of costs to charges (RCCs). These RCCs are calculated using the OSHPD Financial
Disclosure Data, which reports facility-level data on total operating expenses, gross patient
revenue, and other non-operating revenue. Because other non-operating revenue consists of
revenue from hospital enterprises such as the outpatient pharmacy and gift-shop, we follow
the approach recommended by OSHPD (1993) in calculating the facility-specific RCC as:
RCC = (Total Operating Expenses-Other Non-operating Revenue)/Gross Patient Revenue.
Although RCCs are commonly used to estimate costs based on charges, the fact that
OSHPD data does not permit disaggregation of inpatient charges into its component
departments and services so that institution-level RCCs must be used, is an important
limitation since they cannot reflect discrepancies between costs and charges that arise because
of internal cross-subsidization across departments and services within a facility. Nevertheless,
facility-level RCCs can adjust for certain discrepancies between costs and charges, such as if
a facility treats a large proportion of charity cases (Finkler, 1982), and have been found to
perform somewhat better than charges as proxies for costs (Newhouse, Cretin and Witsberger,
1989; Schwartz, Young and Siegrist, 1995). While this suggests some justification for
analyzing RCC-adjusted charges rather than raw charges, the most compelling reason during
the period we study is the growing inflation of rates charges to full paying customers and
concomitant use of rebates for managed contracts, so that charge growth based on charges
7

Discharges from managed care facilities exempted from standard accounting requirements were identified in
the data by a zero recorded in data field for total charges, although actual charges were non-zero. In total, this

15

will overstate real cost increases (Dranove et al., 1991). The advantage of using cost-tocharge ratios in this case is that increases in gross patient charges that are offset by increases
in rebates result in a decrease in the cost-to charge ratio a calculated above, so that estimates
of costs based on patient-level charges and RCCs are not inappropriately inflated by the use of
rebates.
In addition to the effects of discrepancies between costs and charges on aggregate
charge growth, it is also important to consider the possibility that such discrepancies could
have effects on costs across the spending distribution if they do not apply uniformly across it.
Indeed, it is possible that the discrepancy between costs and charges could vary across the
spending distribution. For example, if the mark-up on low cost services and departments
exceeds the mark-up on high-cost services and departments, then the actual distribution of
costs across patients will be more concentrated than suggested by the distribution of charges.
Though it is not clear that it is the case, it is possible that such mark-ups might change over
time – for example if competition is particularly intense in high-cost services so that cost
containment differentially reduces charges in these area. If so, it is possible that an analysis of
hospital charges may overstate costs at the bottom of the distribution in later years, and
understate costs at the top of the cost distribution.
Although this would lead to patterns in hospital costs similar to those we find, we do
not believe that internal cross-subsidization drives our results because we study a period in
which all payers were tightening their reimbursement policies, thereby imposing a constraint
on the extent to which hospitals could shift costs to other payers and departments. Indirect
support for this comes from Dranove and White (1998), who studied the responses of
hospitals in California to Medicaid fee reductions between 1983 and 1992 and found
involves omitting 8.8% of discharges.
16

significant reductions in levels of services provided to all patients, and Medicaid patients in
particular, but no evidence of cost-shifting. The ideal data to test this would allow us to
assess whether rebates were more likely for sicker patients within a hospital, but the available
data do not permit this disaggregated analysis because rebates are not made on a patient level
basis. However, as an alternative check, we examined whether hospitals in the OSHPD data
that care for sicker patients as measured by either greater average age, length of stay or inhospital mortality were likely to give greater rebates to payers as a percent of net revenue.
Our results suggest no evidence of any significant relationship or change in relationship over
time between rebates and age or length of stay, but do suggest a positive relationship between
rebates and mortality in the first six years we study that is eliminated by the end of the period.
While this latter result could suggest an artificial inflation of costs for the sickest patients
initially that is later eliminated, the effect is not large.
Thus, while there are possible reasons to be concerned that changes in the relationship
between costs and charges across patients that differ in severity of illness could influence our
results, we cannot find evidence of any changes in such relationships.

Limitations of Cost and Financial Data
Several data and analytic limitations should be recognized at the outset. First, the
1983-1993 period was one during which hospital accounting and reimbursement systems were
in flux. Hospitals are instructed by OSHPD to report the total charges incurred during a
patient’s hospitalization according to the facility’s full-established rates prior to any
prepayment deductions. At a minimum, hospitals are to include all charges associated with
daily hospital services, ancillary services, and patient care services in calculations of total

17

inpatient charges per discharge. Physician fees are omitted. Due to the volume of discharges
processed, OSHPD does not conduct comprehensive accounting checks; hence the reliability
of reported data on charges is not known. Nevertheless, the OSHPD charge data has been
widely used by a variety of researchers (for example: Dranove and White, 1998; Melnick and
Zwanziger, 1995; Langa and Sussman, 1993; Langa, 1992; Stafford, 1990; Robinson and
Phibbs, 1989).
Another issue relates to our lack of data concerning charges associated with outpatient
care and forms of post-discharge care. Since the introduction of PPS and managed care, many
have speculated that any decline in hospital spending may be offset by growth in other sectors
such as ambulatory and long-term care. Since we are unable to account for cost-shifting
across sites of delivery, our finding that growth in hospital charges fell among high-cost
admissions does not imply that the total cost of treatment among high-cost admissions also
fell, since these patients may be heavy consumers of post-discharge health care resources.
However, we found no tendency for differential cost reduction among high cost admissions
with increasing competition in diagnoses with high or increasing levels of discharge to skilled
nursing facilities. Moreover, even if such a pattern were found, it could be understood as
providing insight into a mechanism by which quality discrimination was accomplished.
A final point concerns the period over which we have data to analyze. The earliest
data we have date back to 1983, the year in which Medicare’s DRG-based Prospective
Payment System was implemented, and legislation authorizing selective contracting between
Medi-Cal (California’s Medicaid Program) and service providers took effect. Also,
throughout the 1983-1993 period studied, HMOs and a variety of other managed care
organizations emerged and proliferated. Because we do not have comparable data that

18

antedate these major changes and because important changes were happening in the
reimbursement strategies for younger persons at the same time, it is important to be cautious
in drawing a causal connection between these specific policies and observed trends in charge
growth. On the other hand, because Medicare PPS, Medi-Cal, and managed care all rely on
different approaches to achieve cost containment, we can borrow insights from the theoretical
models of provider responses to alternative reimbursement systems described above in
interpreting our findings.
Despite these limitations, the OSHPD data offer an opportunity to study growth in
hospital charges over ten consecutive years. Particularly advantageous are the availability of
data through the early 1990s and across patients above and below age 65, enabling us to
extend research examining the long-term effects of widespread movement towards fixed-rate
prospective payment by contrasting the pattern of cost growth of older persons affected
directly by prospective payment with that of younger persons.

Measures of Competition
A large literature exists attempting to identify the appropriate measures of markets and
competition within health care. Key debates in this literature include how one defines a
market (e.g. by county, distance, patient flows, or economic measures such as cross-price
elasticities), whether one is interested in competition at the hospital level, medical service
level, or patient level, and what mathematical measure of concentration is used (e.g.
Herfindahl Index, entropy measure, etc.).8 Although these approaches may differ in their

8

There is a large literature on defining hospital markets for the purpose of measuring competition. Traditional
measures have included market definitions based on geopolitical boundaries such as counties or metropolitan
statistical areas (e.g. Joskow (1980)), distance (Robinson and Luft (1985)), or patient flows (e.g. Melnick and

19

theoretical appeal both in general and in individual applications, expediency has often been a
prime criteria by which measures of competition are selected, and by far the most common
approach chosen has been to calculate Herfindahl indexes for total admissions at the county
level.9 In the analyses reported here, we follow this same approach. Several studies have
examined the robustness of the effects of competition to the measure chosen and some have
found that their results depend on the definition of competition chosen (e.g. Dranove,
Shanley, and Simon, 1992.; Sohn, 1996; Kessler and McClellan, 1999). As a result, we also
plan in future work to attempt to repeat our analyses with alternative measures of competition.

Analytic Plan
To analyze the effects of competition across the distribution of health care
expenditures, we include measures of competition in quantile regressions of cost for patients
above and below age 65 before the implementation of PPS in 1983, and in 1993. Our basic
hypothesis is that competition under PPS will exert a downward pressure on costs among the
most expensive elderly patients in 1993 relative to its effects among the less expensive elderly
in 1993, relative to the expensive elderly in 1983, and relative to its effects among the young.
To pick the most appropriate comparison group among the young, we focus on persons age
55-64, though our results are not substantially different when we include persons age 5-64.
Since our theory does not specify a specific measure of concentration and since we have no
reason to suspect a linear relationship between any particular measure of concentration and
Zwanziger (1988)). These measures have all been criticized for varying reasons, including the (ir)relevance of
geopolitical boundaries or distance with respect to competition, and the endogeneity of patient flows. While
some newer approaches have tried to address these concerns (e.g. Kessler and McClellan, 1999), such
approaches are substantially more difficult to implement, and their merits have not yet been demonstrated.
While a comparison of multiple measures of competition would be of value, we therefore defer it for future
work.

20

costs, we define a set of indicator variables to categorize counties as competitiveness based on
the Herfindahl Index (Less Competitive (HI>0.2), Moderately Competitive (0.2>HI>0.1),
Competitive (0.1>HI>0.05), Very Competitive (HI<0.05). We also control for payer
(Medicare, Medi-Cal, Other non-private, and private), and a variety of market-level and
hospital characteristics. The market level characteristics are: log physicians per capita, log
HMO enrollment rate, log county population, and log average per capita income. Hospital
level characteristics are ownership status (for-profit vs. not for-profit), teaching status
(teaching hospital vs. non-teaching hospital), number of licensed beds, and total number of
annual discharges. In our basic specification we do not control for patient characteristics such
as age and comorbidity because PPS does not base much if any of reimbursement on those
factors. As a result, selectively caring for patients who are younger or have less comorbidity
may be a mechanism by which hospitals respond to PPS and limit costs, so that controlling
for those variables could mask the effect we aim to identify. In alternative specifications, we
also include patient age and the number of secondary diagnoses, and find little change in our
overall results.
We limit our analyses to 12 highest-volume DRGs, which we define as those with at
least 10,000 discharges over the age of 4 in 1983 and 1994 combined. An important concern
in this analysis relates to the incentives under Medicare PPS for hospitals to engage in ‘DRG
creep’, i.e. progressively up-code patients into DRGs with a higher reimbursement rate for a
given condition (Carter, Newhouse, and Relles, 1990). As a result, changes in charges within
each stratified DRG might reflect trends in coding and classification rather than changes in
service provision. To address this concern, we aggregated DRGs for the same procedure

index.

21

and/or condition that are stratified for severity in calculating utilization rates and growth in
charges.10

Adjustments for changes in discharge rates
In order to know how to interpret changes in the effects of competition at different
points in the spending distribution over time and also to generate meaningful estimates of cost
growth over time at different points in the spending distribution, it is important to consider the
dramatic decline in admission rates in California over this period, since a given position in the
spending distribution may reflect a different degree of severity in different years. The
California data show that per capita hospital discharge rates declined steadily from 112
discharges per 1,000 total population in 1983 to 69 discharges per 1,000 total population by
1994. The decline in California’s discharge rates is consistent with national utilization trends,
which began slowing in the 1970s but declined even further since the 1980s. Much of the
decline has been attributed to more widespread use of utilization control mechanisms by
Medicare, state Medicaid programs, managed care and other third party payers. These
controls include peer-review organizations, physician gatekeepers, and pre-certification
requirements employed by Medicare and other third party payers. In California especially,
declining rates of discharges may also reflect the expansion of HMO enrollment and the shift
of many services to outpatient settings.
Assuming stable population morbidity from year to year, a falling admission rate
implies that in each successive year, a smaller proportion of episodes of illness result in

10

Another possibility would be to analyze the effects of competition on cost growth within ICD-9 codes.
However, we elected not to do this because the incentives created by Medicare PPS that may differentially affect
high and low cost patients refer to high and low cost patients within DRG groups rather than within ICD-9
codes.

22

hospitalization. If one were to rank all admissions in order of increasing severity of illness, it
would be reasonable to assume that, given the nature of utilization control measures, the
distribution would tend to be truncated from the left, leaving the least severely ill episode
denied hospital admission. Hence, not only does the proportion of the population
experiencing hospitalization shrink over time, but the average severity level of the
hospitalized population would be expected to increase as well because there are fewer
‘healthy’ admissions to dilute the spending distribution.
Figure 2 illustrates how shifts in utilization rates can complicate intertemporal
comparisons of expenditures at specific locations within the population spending distribution.
The X-axis plots the percent of population ranked in order of increasing severity of illness.
The Y-axis plots the frequency or number of individuals at each severity level. The curves in
Figures 2a and 2b depict the distribution of illness in a given population at two time points,
(Year 0 and Year 1), which we assume to be stable. H0 and H1 represent the discharge rates in
Year 0 and Year 1, respectively. In this hypothetical population, the top 50% of the
population ranked in terms of morbidity were hospitalized in Year 0. In Year 1, the
admission rate fell to 40%.
Suppose we wish to compare effects on median hospital charges between Year 0 and
Year 1. In Year 0, the median discharge (M0) was the patient at the 75th percentile of the
disease distribution. In Year 1, the median discharge (M1) was at the 80th percentile of the
disease distribution. Because of the falling discharge rate between Year 1 and Year 2, these
two discharges are not directly comparable. This is seen in Figure 2 by the dotted line that
traces M0 down to the disease distribution in Year 1, and by the dotted line that traces M1
above to the disease distribution in Year 0. Thus, the median discharge in Year 0 was less ill

23

than the median discharge in Year 1. Without taking into account falling discharge rates, a
simple comparison between the median hospitalizations in Year 0 and Year 1 will compare
patients that differ in their severity of illness.
To address this concern due to falling admission rates, we also performed all our
analyses based on adjusted percentiles in which we aim to compare persons with comparable
levels of severity of illness. Therefore, we examine growth rates or the effects of competition
at adjusted percentiles wherever discharge rates fell between two time points according to the
formula:
P0 = [(H0 – (H1*(1-P1))/H0]*100
where P0 is the adjusted percentile in the earlier time period (Y0), P0 is the percentile
in the later time period (Y1), and H0 and H1 are the discharge rates in the two corresponding
years. For example, to compare costs at the median of the spending distribution of the
hypothetical population, we should compare the median discharge in Year 1 to the discharge
at the 60th percentile of discharges in Year 0 (60=[(50–(40*(1.5)))/60]*100. We use this
approach directly to calculate growth rates at different percentiles in the spending distribution.
To analyze the effects of competition, we implement this adjustment by performing our
regression analyses using the same number of observations drawn from the top of the
distribution of the 1983 data as we have in the 1993 data.
Our method of adjustment exploits the fact that discharges fell over time, and that
utilization control mechanisms typically raised the threshold of illness severity for hospital
admission. This raises several potential problems. One is that in DRGs in which discharge
rates rise over time, it is not clear whether expanded services were extended to the less
severely ill, or if improvements in technology and medical management enabled treatment of

24

a greater number of the severely ill who would otherwise have remained untreated. Thus, in
analyzing spending growth for the few DRGs where admission rates rose, we use all the
observations from 1983 and analyze only unadjusted percentiles.
Probably more important is the possibility that reductions in admission did not come
uniformly from the left tail of the distribution during this period. In an extreme example,
suppose that, although we assumed the reduction of 43 admissions per 1,000 population
between 1983 and 1993 came from the right of the distribution (the ‘healthy’ side), the
reductions actually came entirely from the right side of the distribution. This might happen,
for example, if the 43 fewer admissions in 1993 were terminally ill individuals who had been
shifted into hospices but who would have died in hospitals at high cost in 1983. The top of
the 1993 distribution would then be expected to have a lower average severity of illness level
compared to the top of the 1983 distribution – the opposite of our assumption. This implies
that an unadjusted comparison would understate growth, and that our adjustment procedure
would further exacerbate this. Fortunately, for the diagnoses that we examine, we believe that
most of the reductions in are due to the movement of less-severely ill patients to the outpatient
setting. This is supported by the observation that the greatest declines in admission rates in
our sample were among admissions for Esophageal and Gastrointestinal Disorders, which
likely results from a movement towards treatment if the least severely ill patients to an
ambulatory setting. It is also supported by additional analyses we performed that showed that
the degree of comorbidity of patients in the DRGs we studied increased over our sample
period.11 Nevertheless, we also examined the robustness of our findings under the assumption

11

Specifically, we calculated the Charlson co-morbidity index based on secondary diagnoses for the index
admission, and found that the distribution of scores shifted upwards in all our DRGs (Charlson et al. (1987);
Deyo and Romano (1993), and Romano et al. (1993)).

25

that the reduction in admissions is distributed evenly across the spending distribution by
examining growth rates at the unadjusted percentiles.

Section IV – RESULTS
Distribution of RCC-adjusted Charges by DRG: 1983 and 1993
Tables 1 and 2 show the number of cases and distribution of costs in 1983 and 1993
for the 12 DRGs we examine. As Figure 1 shows clearly, the distribution of costs in every
DRG is highly skewed to the right, with about two-thirds of all admissions having costs below
the mean (Tables 1-2). This lays out the basic incentives implicit in PPS – that the majority of
patients are profitable, while a minority are unprofitable but potentially responsible for large
losses.

Growth of RCC-adjusted Charges by DRG: 1983 and 1993
Table 3 shows the growth of costs from 1983 to 1993 at unadjusted and adjusted
percentiles for persons older than age 65. Although there are a few exceptions, the vast
majority of the unadjusted and adjusted growth rates clearly show falling growth rates with
increasing position in the spending distribution, as predicted by the theoretical predictions of
the effects of prospective payment.
Table 4 repeats these analyses for persons age 55-64. While the pattern is not as
strong in several diagnoses as for those persons above age 65, there is still a clear trend for
falling growth rates with increasing position in the spending distribution. This is not as
predicted by the theoretical model. We discuss possible reasons for this below.

26

Effects of Competition on Hospital Expenditures: 1983 and 1993
To limit the number of tables, we present the results of the competition analyses in full
only for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and only the coefficients on the competition
variables for the remaining DRGs. Table 5 reports the quantile regressions for admissions for
AMI for persons above age 65 in 1983 and 1993, while Table 6 reports regressions for AMI
admissions for persons ages 55-64. Table 7 reports the coefficients on the competition
variables from the quantile regressions for all 12 DRGs we examine for 1983 and 1993 for
persons above age 65 and for persons ages 55-64. We begin with the panel on the left
examining admissions for persons above age 65. Examining first the results for 1983, we see
in every case that costs rise with increasing competition, and particularly for the most
expensive admissions. This is consistent with the “medical arms race” literature, which
suggests that under the retrospective reimbursement system in place at the beginning of the
period we study, a more competitive hospital market will raise costs as hospitals compete to
attract doctors and their patients by offering added services (Robinson and Luft, 1985). In
contrast, in 1993, increasing competitiveness is associated with decreased costs in all 12
diagnoses. This consistent with prior findings such as those of Melnick and Zwanziger
(1988), who found that costs fell by more than 11% for hospitals in the most competitive
markets in California during this period, while actually rising in the least competitive markets.
Not addressed in their findings, however, is the strong pattern we observe for the reductions in
expenditures with increasing competition to increase progressively along the spending
distribution, as predicted by the incentives of PPS to selectively reduce expenditures among
the most expensive patients. For example, for AMI admissions among the elderly the highest

27

level of competition is associated with $8,338 lower costs at the 95th percentile, but only
$1,454 lower costs at the 25th percentile.
The right hand panel of Table 7 repeats the above analyses for persons age 55-64. In
general, we still find strong positive effects of competition on costs in 1983, but in 1993 we
find much smaller negative effects of competition on costs that are statistically significant for
only 4 of the 12 DRGs. Several DRGs also show a statistically insignificant trend towards
lower costs with competition, raising the question whether some of the difference may be due
to reduced sample size. However, increasing the sample analyzed to include all persons
below age 65 or adding additional years of data (e.g. 1992), did not meaningfully alter these
results. This suggests that whatever forces led to changes in the distribution of hospital
expenditures in these diagnoses among the elderly between 1983 and 1993 may have also
affected those below age 65, though the effects do not appear to have been as powerful.

Adjustments for Changes in Discharge Rates
To address the concern that percentiles in one year may not be comparable to
percentiles in another year due to changes in severity of illness, especially due to declines in
admission rates due to the shift of inpatient services to the outpatient setting, we also
examined quantile regressions for DRGs in which admission rates fell from 1983 to 1993 that
limited the number of observation in 1983 to the number in 1993, so as to compare
“comparable” patients assuming no change in the underlying distribution of disease. These
were not substantively different than the regressions reported in Tables 5 and 6.

28

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
Summary
Using annual patient discharge data from all non-federal, acute-care hospitals in the
State of California from 1983 and 1993, we examined growth in hospital costs and the effects
of competition on costs at various points in the spending distribution for persons above and
below age 65 for the 12 largest diagnosis-related groups. Our analyses of cost growth show
cost growth falling with increasing position in the spending distribution in every DRG we
studied, as predicted by the effects of Medicare PPS. However, a very similar pattern is also
evident among admissions of patients age 55-64. Our analyses of the effects of competition
show a strong trend for increasing competition to increase expenditures in all ages groups in
1983, with increasing effects at higher locations in the spending distribution. Our analyses for
those above age 65 in 1993 show the opposite pattern, however, with increasing competition
associated with decreased costs, and the effects far larger among the most expensive patients.
Moreover, this pattern is not as pronounced among those below age 65, suggesting that
spending on persons above age 65 during this period may have been subject to some forces
different than those affecting spending on persons below age 65.
These findings are broadly consistent with the model of provider behavior under
alternative reimbursement schemes that we present. This predicts a tendency for hospitals to
‘skimp’ on unprofitable patients and to ‘milk’ profitable patients under fixed-rate prospective
reimbursement. Although a number of studies have documented lower resource utilization
associated with fixed-rate reimbursement systems, fewer have considered the possibility that
such reductions might differentially affect profitable and unprofitable classes of patients, and

29

none have demonstrated these patterns of increasing cost reductions among high-cost patients
for Medicare PPS, or shown that these reductions increase with increasing competition.

Limitations
Certainly the establishment of PPS and the associated incentives to selectively
decrease costs among the most costly patients is a plausible explanation for the patterns we
observe among the elderly, but several other possible explanations are worth considering.
One is that there were changes in particular medical technologies or the underlying severity of
illness among the elderly over this period that somehow selectively reduced expenditures for
the high-cost elderly relative to the low cost-elderly. Concerning in this regard is the fact that
we see a fairly similar pattern of growth rates among those age 55-64. It is not clear why this
is the case, but it seems highly plausible that practice patterns are likely to be similar for older
and younger patients, so that the incentives implicit in PPS end up affecting practice patterns
for patients below age 65 as well. Moreover, if the changes in spending we observe are
explained by some specific change in underlying severity of illness or medical technology, it
is not clear why such changes should occur over such a broad range of diagnoses or be
associated with increased competition. Also, in additional analyses we also stratified the
elderly according to age and controlled for measurable aspects of underlying comorbidity
using the number of secondary diagnoses, and found no changes in our results.
Another possibility is that our results may reflect changes in coding practices under
Medicare, often referred to as “DRG creep”. We have tried to address this concern in our
analysis by combining related DRGs with and without complications, but it is possible that
this does not capture all the changes that could have occurred. Indeed, one particular concern

30

is that the development of the tracheostomy DRG in 1991 for patients requiring mechanical
ventilation may have drawn some expensive patients out of the upper part of the distribution
of costs of some of our DRGs. While this is important to consider, the fraction of all
admissions in that DRG is only 0.1% to 0.2%, which seems too modest to explain the broad
changes we see across the spending distribution for such a broad range of diagnoses. Also,
some of the pattern we identify is clearly present by 1991, when the tracheostomy DRG was
just being introduced. Moreover, it is somewhat surprising that such recoding would be
present only in the most competitive markets, though certainly that would also be of interest if
it were the case. It should also be noted that, to the extent that some of our diagnoses may be
more highly reimbursed than other closely related diagnoses, they may also be the recipients
of up-coding, in which case one would expect expenditures at the lower end of the
distribution to decline as healthier patients are added to the distribution.
Finally, it should also be noted that our findings that cost reductions are largest for the
most expensive patients might also be interpreted as simply reflecting that it is easier to save
large amounts of money where more money is being spent. We are sympathetic to this
concern, but note that we find a similar pattern of reductions in both our more and less
expensive DRGs, and that it is not always the case that it is easier to decrease spending where
more money is being spent. For example, in analyzing data from a natural experiment
comparing the cost of hospital care provided by doctors who specialize in inpatient care to
care by doctors who spend only a small fraction of their time taking care of inpatients, we
found no evidence that cost savings differed across the distribution of costs (Meltzer et al.,
2000).

31

Conclusions
With an understanding of the limitations of our analysis, it appears that increasing
competition in the context of prospective payment is associated with selective reductions of
expenditures for the most expensive patients. Whether this is desirable is impossible to
determine without an analysis of the effects on outcomes. Nevertheless, our results suggest
several clear lines for such analysis.
First, the possibility that costs are selectively reduced for the most costly patients
suggests that outcomes may also be selectively affected. And while more than few studies
have examined the effects of prospective payment on outcomes (e.g. Rodgers et al. (1990) and
accompanying articles; Cutler, 1995), none has stratified outcomes according to patient cost.
Our results suggest that such analyses might be very useful, since it is possible that adverse
effects among the most costly patients might be masked by their inclusion along with less
costly patients, whose outcomes may even improve if increased resources allocated to
attracting them to a particular hospital have some positive (albeit small) effect on outcomes.
The same conclusion applies for attempts to measure the effects of competition on outcomes
(e.g. Kessler and McClellan, 1999)
Additionally, our results have important implications for measuring the quality of care
under prospective payment systems, and especially in competitive environments, since they
suggest that high cost patients may be at particular risk in such contexts. Thus, it is important
that quality measures reflect the concerns of that potentially vulnerable group. Even when a
single measure of quality is used, our findings may have implications for how to measure
quality of care. For example, our findings may provide a justification to prefer outcomes
measures to process measures, since process measures can suggest quality is high over the

32

whole population when the quality of care for certain parts of the population are actually poor,
while outcomes are often favorable for less severely ill (less costly) patients in any case, so
expending greater resources on them is unlikely to improve outcomes. It is worth noting that
this basic conclusion remains regardless of whether one believes that cost reductions were
largest among the most costly patients due to selective incentives within prospective payment
or whether one simply believes that cost reductions are largest for the most costly patients
simply because, as it has been said, “that’s where the money is”. A related issue is whether
the effects of competition on costs should be interpreted as reducing quality or rather
improving efficiency. Resolution of this question will only be possible with data that permits
a comprehensive assessment of outcomes.
It should also be noted that the combination of prospective payment and competition
studied here is not unique to Medicare PPS, but in fact is the basic idea behind the increasing
use of capitated managed care arrangements and competition to control costs, including
perhaps most prominently Medicare managed care. Indeed, such “managed competition”
arrangements present similar incentives to expend resources to attract less costly participants
while avoiding more costly ones. It is not difficult to imagine these incentives resulting in
substantial investments in wellness programs and preventive services, amenities that improve
access for working persons, reductions in copayments, etc. that would attract relatively
healthy participants. Even casual observation of the offerings of health maintenance
organizations leaves little question that many of these offerings are indeed occurring, but
whether such expenditures are an efficient use of health care resources and how they may
impact the care received by the most severely ill are important questions for future work.
This is especially true given evidence that quality of care in HMOs may be worst for patients

33

who are chronically ill (Miller and Luft, 1997), and that HMOs may limit expenditures for
severely ill persons in intensive care (Rapoport, et al., 1992; Cher and Lenert, 1997) .
Finally, it should be noted that there a variety of approaches that could be tried to
improve upon existing prospective payment systems. These include improved risk adjusters
and use of “blended” payment systems that include both prospective and retrospective
components to lessen the incentives for patient selection or the provision of too much or too
little care. Indeed, the Medicare Prospective Payment System has always tied reimbursement
to the amount of care provided to some extent and thus never been fully prospective
(McClellan, 1997). Moreover, proposals have been seriously considered to expand this
retrospective aspect of Medicare PPS as well as to improve risk adjusters by developing a
DRG system that allows a finer classification of admissions (Newhouse, Buntin, and
Chapman, 1997). Our work provides support for the value of continued examination of both
these approaches.
