    "abstract": "\n\nShould policymakers offer forward guidance in terms of a path for an instrument such as interest rates or a target for an outcome such as unemployment? We study how the optimal approach depends on a departure from rational expectations. People have a limited understanding of the behavior of others and of the general equilibrium (GE) effects of policy. The bite of such bounded rationality on implementability and welfare is minimized by target-based guidance if and only if GE feedbacks are strong enough. This offers a rationale for why central banks should shine the spotlight on unemployment when faced with a prolonged liquidity trap, a steep Keynesian cross, or a large financial accelerator.\n\n",
