The Value of Reductions in Child Injury Mortality in the U.S.
Sherry Glied
NBER Working Paper No. 7204
July 1999
JEL No. I1
ABSTRACT
Child injury mortality rates have declined steadily over time and across causes of death. This
paper investigates alternative explanations for this decline and evaluates their value.
I assess changes in children’s living circumstances, changes in the professional child injury
knowledge base, changes in the information imparted to parents, and changes in the regulation of
childhood behavior and, in the context of a model of health production, explore how each of these
changes might have been expected to affect child safety.
These hypotheses are then tested empirically using data from the National Mortality Detail
Files on the number of child deaths by age, cause, and state and combine this information with data
from the Current Population Survey on the characteristics of children and their families by state. I
find that changes in children’s living circumstances can explain little, if any of the change in child
health. I find limited evidence that regulatory interventions intended to change behavior have been
important. I find substantial evidence suggesting that changes in the knowledge available to parents
about child health have become increasingly important, while parents’ time has become less important
in producing health.
These results provide a first effort in understanding the dramatic reduction in child injury
mortality. They also illustrate how the development of scientific information, a public good, is
translated into private outcomes, and can generate growing inequality in those outcomes.

One of the bright spots in the changing circumstances of American children over the past 3
decades has been the significant decline in child mortality. The mortality rate among children 1-4
fell 57 % between 1960 and 1990 and the rate for children 5-14 fell 48% over those 30 years
(Vital Statistics, 1963, 1994). In percentage terms, these declines are steeper than those
experienced by any other age group.
Many of the improvements in child health stem from revolutionary developments in
medicine. Congenital anomalies of the heart, many infectious diseases, and several childhood
cancers, important causes of death in 1960, no longer threaten children. Further improvements,
even into the 1990s, have come through vaccination campaigns, which have nearly eradicated
several childhood infectious diseases (most recently meningitis). A growing share of the
reduction in child mortality, however, stems neither from medical advances nor from
immunization campaigns. Rather, the most important contributor to reductions in mortality since
1970 has been a sharp decline in the rate of child mortality from unintentional injury or accidents
Among children under 5, that rate dropped from 44 deaths per 100,000 population in 1960 to
18.6 deaths per 100,000 population in 1990. Among children 5-9, the rates dropped from 19.6 to
9.8.
Despite these large declines in mortality, unintentional injury remains the leading cause of
death among children age 1-14 and most of these deaths are, in some sense, avoidable (Rivara and
Grossman, 1996). Today, virtually all excess mortality among children in the U.S. relative to
other industrialized countries is due to unintentional injury and violence (Division of Injury
Control, 1990). Understanding the reasons for the decline in injury mortality is important to
further reduce these rates. Furthermore, understanding the mechanisms that brought about the
decline in child injury mortality may also inform the design of public policies aimed at reducing
violent deaths among children and reducing unintentional injuries in other groups. Finally, like
other improvements in health, this decline in the riskiness of childhood should figure in an
assessment of changes in the cost of living. The purpose of this paper is to examine the
determinants and assess the value of the decline in childhood unintentional injury mortality.

II.

A Model of Child Mortality from Unintentional Injury
The recent decline in child injury mortality in the U.S. is characterized by two features: its

pervasiveness and its timing. Accidental injury rates have declined sharply in almost every
category in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9). Childhood mortality rates
remained quite steady across most causes through the 1960s, and began to decline sharply in the
1970s. The rate of decline actually accelerated over time. In both percentage terms and absolute
magnitudes, declines in accidental injury rates were generally greater in the 1980s than in the
1970s.
Epidemiological literature on changes in childhood accident mortality has focused on
specific steps taken to avoid injury: whether children wear seatbelts, whether pools are fenced,
whether smoke detectors are installed in homes (Office of Technology Assessment, 1986). These,
and similar interventions, have been shown to be effective, but epidemiologists generally agree
that at current rates of use, these interventions cannot explain a very large proportion of the
change in mortality. Furthermore, the pervasiveness of these declines across disparate categories
suggest that the decline in unintentional injury mortality cannot be attributed exclusively to a small
number of inteventions. For example, while car seats and child-proof prescription bottles may
have contributed to declines in automobile and poisoning deaths, specific regulations of this type
cannot explain the equally substantial declines in pedestrian deaths (Rivara and Grossman, 1996;
Rivara 1990).
The analysis presented here takes a more general approach to trends in childhood injury
mortality, relating mortality to characteristics of families and to the overall level of technology.
In this approach, a decline in injury mortality from automobile accidents could be a consequence
of an improvement in automobile design, a decrease in the number of children the average driver
must supervise, a reduction in the number of auto rides taken by children, an increase in seat belt
use, or better trauma care for children. This approach is analogous to that in most health
production models (e.g., Auster, Levenson, and Sarachek, 1969).

2

Mortality from injury in childhood can be viewed as the product of two (largely) distinct
processes.
(1)

Mortality = Accident*(Mortality|Accident)
The first process leads to the occurrence of an accidental injury to a child. The second

process generates a death as the outcome of that process1. Improvements in childhood mortality
may be a consequence of reductions in the rate of accident or improvements in accident
outcomes.
Following Grossman (1972), I can describe the first process, child safety (the absence of
an accident), as the output of a household health production function2. In the Grossman-type
model, parents use technology to combine time and money inputs and produce child health:
(2)

Accident=H(T, M; E)

where T represents parental time, M represents parental investments in goods related to childhood
safety, and E represents the technology used in home production.
H’T <0, H’M <0, H’E <0
In this model, improvements in the level of child safety (reductions in accidents) may be a
consequence of increases in the amount of time or money devoted to child health. These
increases in time or money inputs may reflect increases in family endowments, changes in family
preferences about the disposition of these endowments, or changes compelled by regulation.
Alternatively, improvements in child health may be a consequence of improvements in the
technology used to produce child health.
As I discuss in detail in the data section below, there were no general and substantial
improvements in the resources available to families over the late 1960-1990 period. Family
incomes did not increase substantially, family size fell slightly, and more mothers worked. While

1

The processes are not completely distinct in that the severity of an accident will affect health outcomes.
Note that this model assumes that the parental utility value of child safety has not changed over the 19601990 period. This assumption is violated to the extent that improvements in other aspects of child health
led parents to value children more. Such adjacent complementarities are unlikely to be substantial in this
context because the absolute rate of childhood mortality, even in 1960, was very low.
2

3

family preferences over the disposition of resources may have changed, but there is no compelling
reason to believe that preferences changed substantially over the period. Instead, I focus on
changes in regulations and in information.
Regulation
The late 1960s and early 1970s were the heyday of the U.S. consumer protection
movement. Child protection was an important goal of consumer protection efforts and several
major federal and state legislative initiatives passed in this period focused on child safety. At the
Federal level, the Consumer Product Safety Commission produced a range of mandatory and
voluntary standards designed to increase the safety of products that children might contact.
Products affected by the legislation included toys, children’s furniture (such as cribs and changing
tables), and products intended for adults that children might use. In the mid-1970s, a separate set
of legislative initiatives altered the packaging of drugs to reduce the risk of child poisoning and
required that children’s sleepwear meet flammability standards (Consumer Product Safety
Commission, 1993).
At the state level, the most important initiatives focused on highway safety. Between
1977 and 1984, all states passed legislation requiring children (usually those under 5) to be in a
child safety seat when in an automobile (the details of the regulations vary considerably among
states). A few states also required older children to wear seat belts in the front seat (Office of
Technology Assessment, 1988). Three states, however, rescinded laws requiring use of seat belts
(among older children) during the late 1980s (Agran, Castillo, and Winn, 1990). Use of vehicle
restraints increased sharply during the 1980s, especially among infants but also among older
children (Carden, Rivara, and Soderberg, 1994; Agran, Castillo, and Winn, 1990).
Several studies have examined the effectiveness of a few of these regulatory initiatives
(Office of Technology Assessment, 1988). The most convincing results have been found for child
safety seats, which, when used properly, have been shown to reduce the risk of child mortality by
about 35% (Office of Technology Assessment, 1988).

4

Information
The regulatory environment of the late 1960s and early 1970s followed from, and often
encouraged, the development of information about child safety. Prior to the mid-1960s, most
research on child health had focused on diseases. As childhood disease mortality declined,
epidemiologists attention turned to injury and accident risks. The subfield of injury epidemiology
began in the mid-1960s (Robertson, 1992). The Consumer Product Safety Commission, and
similar organizations, encouraged further research in these areas.
Table 1 provides data about the increase in the production of information about childhood
injury. The table lists the number of publications indexed in Medline, the main medical search
index, whose subject was childhood injury in the United States. As the table suggests,
publications on childhood injury have been growing steadily, both in absolute terms and as a share
of all publications on children in the United States.
Injury epidemiology led directly toward injury prevention in four distinct ways. First,
epidemiology led to regulation. In the mid-1960s, for example, epidemiologists in the New York
City Department of Health began to examine the characteristics of child injury mortality. They
found that an average of 30-60 children under 5 were dying in New York City (mainly Manhattan
and the Bronx) each year because of falls from apartment buildings. This information led to a
campaign to inform parents of the risk of falls and to encourage (and eventually require) landlords
to install window guards. By 1980, the number of children dying because of falls in New York
had declined to 4 (Office of Technology Assessment, 1988).
Second, epidemiology provided a basis for lawsuits alleging that a defective product had
led to injury. Litigation, and the fear of potential litigation, may have been a motive for the
development of voluntary product safety standards in several industries.
Third, epidemiology led to the development of new products. As the relative risks of
different causes of injury became better known, manufacturers developed a host of child-proofing
products to respond to the risk (Office of Technology Assessment, 1988; Spock, 1990).

5

Finally, epidemiology provided information to parents that enabled them to better allocate
the resources they devoted to child health. One way to see how parents obtained this information
is to compare the content of child development books over time. Table 2 contrasts the safety
information contained in the 1957 2nd edition of the best-selling Dr. Spock manual of baby and
child care to the information contained in the 4th edition (1976) and 6th edition (1990). Clearly,
the emphasis on safety, the level of detail, and the conformity of the recommendations to
epidemiologic evidence all increased substantially over time.
Trauma Care
Rates of mortality after injury vary considerably among causes of mortality. There are
about 32 near-drowning incidents (including hospitalizations) for each child who drowns
(Wintemute, 1990). About 1 in 100 children who are passengers in a motor vehicle that is in an
accident suffer fatal injuries (Rivara, 1990). Pedestrian injury death rates are much higher.
About 4 in 100 children struck by a car dies, and the rate is higher among younger children
(Rivara, 1990).
There were substantial increases in the availability of childhood trauma care during the
1980s. Trauma care is likely to have led to improvements in outcomes from burn and motor
vehicle accidents (Rivara and Grossman, 1996). Nonetheless, childhood trauma care lags well
behind adult trauma care in saving lives. According to the medical literature, trauma care can
contribute less to saving children’s lives than to saving adult’s lives (because children are more
likely to suffer from head trauma; Office of Technology Assessment, 1988). Furthermore, for
several of the principal causes of death among children (particularly drowning, choking, and falls
from more than three stories), most victims die before reaching hospital (Wintemute, 1990; Office
of Technology Assessment, 1988).
The Relationship between Regulation, Technology, and Post-Accident Care and Family
Resrouces
Table 3 categorizes the range of changes in the child health environment over the 19601990 period. Some new information was transmitted entirely through private actions (such as Dr.
6

Spock books). Other information was transmitted through regulations requiring safety labeling.
Product quality improvements followed regulations and informational developments. Finally,
regulations also imposed requirements on parents and others to make use of available safety
equipment.
These different environmental changes are likely to have had different types of effects.
Furthermore, the effects are likely to have differed across different types of families.
In the context of the child health production model, information that leads parents to
recognize risks that they were previously unaware of (or better responses to risks), can lead to
reallocations of time and money that allow the production of better health at the same cost. That
is, this information improves the technology for production of health. If information is conveyed
through voluntary mechanisms, better educated parents are more likely to have access to it.
Labeling requirements may convey information to both more educated and less educated parents.
Regulation, by itself, will not have a substantial effect on child health in the standard health
production model. In the case of behavioral regulations, if families are required to increase
certain inputs for child health beyond what they would otherwise choose, they are likely to reduce
other inputs accordingly. Furthermore, behavioral regulations can have perverse effects
(Peltzman, 1975). For example, requiring small children to use car seats may reduce the mortality
of these children, but could lead to increases in the mortality of older children if parents now drive
faster.
Regulations that increase the cost of products, such as rules requiring toys and child
furniture to meet new standards, will favor higher income children. High income children will
benefit when their parents purchase the new products. Low income families, however, may delay
purchasing new products or may purchase second hand products, potentially increasing the risks
facing their children. These regulations may also favor lower birth order children if parents
purchase new products for their firstborn children and then pass them along to younger siblings.
Regulation can be effective, however, if it serves as a means of conveying new information
to parents. To the extent that regulations substitute for information that would otherwise be
7

available in the private market, they may reduce the production advantages of better educated
parents.
Better trauma care is likely to improve outcomes for all children. While high income
children may have better access to physician services, trauma care is provided through emergency
rooms that must take all patients. Higher income children and children outside rural areas may,
however, be more likely to be located near a pediatric trauma center.
III. Empirical Strategy and Data
In principal, the model described in (1) should be tested in two stages: the probability of
accident and the risk of mortality conditional on accident. Unfortunately, there is little data on the
rate of accidents generally. Instead, I examine the determinants of mortality.
The theory of health production suggests that changes in mortality may be a consequence
of changes in time or money inputs or changes in technology. I conduct two (closely related) sets
of analyses to examine the roles of changes in inputs and to assess the nature, and role, of changes
in technology. First, I estimate a model of the production of child injury mortality by cause in the
1960s as a function of family time and money inputs in that period. I then use the estimated
production function to project child mortality by cause in 1980 and 1990 given the characteristics
of children and their families in these later years. I compare the projected and actual mortality
figures to assess the role of changes in measured inputs over this period. The residual is an
estimate of the role of changing health production technology.
Second, I reestimate the model of health production using data from 1980 and 1990. I
then compare the coefficients of key variables to assess how technology altered the production
function for child health. The changes in the coefficients provide an indication of how the
empirical changes in the production of child health conform to those predicted by a health
production model.
Third, I assess the value of these changes in child health. I measure this value by imputing
a value to the lives of children saved through improvements in technology.

Data
Even in 1960, childhood injury mortality was a (thankfully) rare event. In consequence,
standard datasets that include children do not contain enough observations on serious childhood
injury or mortality to serve as the basis of an empirical investigation of its determinants.
Longitudinal mortality databases focus on mortality in the adult population and, in the few cases
that include children, contain too few children to assess the covariates of mortality. Furthermore,
these databases do not allow us to examine changing patterns in child mortality over time.
Instead, I construct a database by combining data from the National Mortality Detail Files with
data from the Current Population Survey.
The National Mortality Detail Files contain a record of every death recorded in the U.S.
Information in the file includes the state of residence of the decedent, the decedent’s age, and the
cause of death. I use data from the 1968, 1969, 1970, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1988, 1989, and 1990
detail files. I select all deaths among children aged 1-12 that occurred because of unintentional
injury (E codes). I then group these causes into several broad categories and focus my analysis on
total unintentional injury mortality and on the four most common causes of childhood injury
mortality: automobile accidents, pedestrian accidents, fires, and drowning. I also examine
mortality due to falls among children 1-5. I group deaths into two categories: pre-school age
children (ages 1-5) and elementary school age children (ages 6-12). I combine data for 19681970, 1978-1980, and 1988-1990 to increase the cell sizes.
The Current Population Survey (CPS) contains demographic and economic information on
adults and children in the U.S. CPS data before 1968 do not contain information on children so I
begin my analysis with the 1968 sample. In each CPS year, I identify all families that contain a
child aged 1-12. I then measure (separately) the average characteristics of families with children
1-5 and 6-12 in each state in the U.S. Prior to 1973, the CPS combines states into 30 regions so
my analysis is limited to these regions. After 1973, I use data at the state level. Sample sizes for
children are quite small, especially in the smaller states. To reduce variability in the data, I
compute averages of each variable in each state over the 3 year periods above (weighted by the
9

number of observations for that year in that state) 3. Because of the high sampling variability in
the CPS, I obtain counts of children in each age group in each state from the decennial censuses
(1970,1980, and 1990).
The health production model suggests that parental time and money, and technology are
the principal inputs in the production of child health. I proxy parental time inputs with five
variables: whether the mother is currently married, whether the mother works, how many infants
(0-1) are in the family, how many pre-school aged children (1-5) are in the family, and how many
older children (6-12) are in the family. I expect that married mothers and non-working mothers
are likely to be able to devote more time to their children. Mothers with infants are likely to have
less time to devote to their older children. The existence of more children of the same age as the
index child within a family may improve health, to the extent that there are economies of scale in
child safety. Older children may be able to help out and reduce injuries among their younger
siblings; alternatively, they may expose their siblings to additional hazards, especially if safety
equipment is handed down from child to child in a family. Changes in safety regulations aimed at
younger children, however, may increase the hazard to older siblings.
In a very small number of CPS families, no mother is present in the household. In these
families, I code the head of household, regardless of sex, as the “mother”. A variable for the
average percentage of households in a state without a mother present was never large or
significant in any of the analyses.
Table 5 provides data on the characteristics of families in 1968, 1978, and 1988. In the
period since 1968, parental time variables have moved in different directions. More mothers are
working and fewer are married. Families are smaller, however, and children are much less likely
to have older or younger siblings in the later years than in the early data.
The second set of inputs in the health production model is money spent on child safety. I
use two variables to measure these money inputs. First, I measure average family income for
3

We analyzed the data both using and not using the CPS weights. We report unweighted results here, but
use of the weights makes no substantial difference to the results
10

families with children 1-5 and families with children 6-12 (note that, as discussed above, I also
control for the number of children 1-12 in these families). Family income, measured in 1968
dollars, declined in the middle period and returned to just above 1968 levels in the later period.
Second, I measure the physical environment of children in each age group. I include variables for
the fraction of children who live in central cities and the fraction who live in SMSAs. Changes in
children’s’ physical environments are likely to have important effects on their well-being. The
types of accidents that occur are likely to be different in cities than in rural areas. For example,
drowning deaths are rare in central cities, more common among younger children in suburban
areas (where private swimming pools exist), and more common among older children in rural
areas (where natural bodies of water pose a hazard). Families have moved out of central cities,
and, to a lesser extent, out of SMSAs over this period.
We include the average level of mother’s education as a measure of the technology for
producing child health. Finally, I include a measure of the percentage of a state’s child population
(in each age group) that is non-white as a control. I exclude observations for the District of
Columbia leaving a dataset with 29 observations in 1968-1970 and 50 observations in 1978-1980
and 1988-1990.
Statistical Method
The dataset constructed by combining CPS and Vital Statistics data contains counts of
child deaths (by cause), counts of children from the Census, and average values of family
characteristics, each measured as state averages. Since the dependent variable data are measured
as counts, I use negative binomial regression methods for the analysis4.
We constrain the coefficent on the (log of the) count of children from the Census to be
equal to 15. I estimate this regression separately for the 1968-1970, 1978-1980, and 1988-1990
data. I use the estimated coefficients from the negative binomial regression to predict the

4

We reject the hypothesis that the data are distributed as a Poisson for every analysis.
In a separate set of regressions in which we did not constrain the coefficient, we can (almost) always
reject the hypothesis that this coefficient is significantly different from 1.

expected number of deaths in subsequent years using the values of the independent variables in
those years.
The coefficients from the negative binomial regression describe the effect of increasing an
independent variable by one unit on the log of deaths from a particular cause. As an easier-tointerpret alternative, I simulate elasticities of response of cause-specific deaths to changes in the
independent variables. I increase the value of each independent variable for each observation in
turn by 1% (holding all other independent variables at their original values) and then compute the
percentage change in the predicted mean for that cause of death. For example, I compute the
percentage effect on pedestrian deaths among 1-5 year olds of increasing the average family
income of families with 1-5 year olds by 1%.
V. Results
We initially estimate the mortality regressions using data for 1968-1970. Coefficients and
standard errors from these specifications are reported in Table 6 for each cause of death and each
age group.
Among younger children, average family characteristics explain 5-10% of the variation in
childhood mortality at the state level. Parental time variables are important contributors to child
mortality for some causes of death in 1968-1970. States with more working mothers tend to have
greater rates of all cause child mortality than do those in which fewer mothers work These states
have significantly higher rates of automobile deaths and pedestrian deaths. Based on the
simulation results (not reported in table), a 1% increase in the proportion of mothers working
would increase the count of child automobile and pedestrian deaths in a state by 7/10% and ½%
respectively. The presence of older or younger children also tends to raise the risk of mortality
for several causes of injury. Increasing the average number of infants in a family by 1% raises
pedestrian deaths among those 1-5 by about ½%. There is some evidence of economies of scale in
child safety production. States where the average 1-5 year old has more preschool age siblings
have substantially and significantly lower rates of mortality among those 1-5.

12

Family income is a significant predictor of childhood mortality only for automobile
mortality among 1-5 year olds in 1968-1970, and for some causes of death the coefficient on
income is small and positive. Overall, a 1% increase in income is associated with a 0.8% decline
in mortality rates. The geographic distribution of children has varying effects depending on the
particular cause of death. Overall, children in states that have more population in central cities
have higher rates of mortality.
Mother’s education has small, often negative, but rarely significant effects on preschool
mortality in the 1-5 year age group. The proportion of children who are non-white greatly
increases the risk of fire deaths, but does not contribute substantially to death from other causes.
Table 6 reports results for elementary school age children 6-12. In general, patterns of
results are quite similar across two age groups. Parental time variables, as a group, are important
contributors to child mortality for all causes of death except pedestrian mortality. In states with
more working mothers, childhood mortality rates from most causes are higher, sometimes
significantly higher. The presence of infants also consistently increases the risk of childhood
mortality among elementary school aged children. A 1% increase in the average number of
infants in families of 6-12 year olds raises mortality rates in this group by about 0.3%.
Family income is a more important determinant of childhood mortality among this older
age group. For all cause, automobile and drowning deaths, children in states with higher average
family income are at lower risk. A 1% increase in average family income reduces the risk of death
from these causes by 1.6%. The geographic distribution of families has limited and inconsistent
effects on mortality outcomes.
Mother’s education has an unexpectedly positive effect on mortality for all cause,
automobile accident and drowning deaths. This result may reflect unmeasured characteristics of
families with more educated mothers. The proportion non-white again increases the risk of fire
deaths but has little correlation with other causes of death.

13

Predicting Mortality
The results of the 1968-1970 suggest that changes in the living circumstances of children
over the 1968-1990 period may have contributed to changes in child mortality. In particular, the
decline in the number of infants in households should have reduced mortality, while the increase in
the proportion of mothers who work would have been expected to lead to an increase in
mortality. Other changes may also have affected mortality outcomes.
To assess the role of these changes, I use the 1968-1970 coefficients to predict rates of
mortality given annual average living circumstances for 1970, 1980, and 1990. Actual counts of
deaths, extrapolations for all causes, automobile accidents, and pedestrian deaths and
extrapolations based on constant rates of mortality are shown in Table 7.
For children 1-5, the prediction regressions substantially overpredict total mortality in the
later years. Actual mortality is less than 1/3 as high as expected. A simple linear extrapolation of
death rates overpredicts mortality by about 80%.
Differences in mortality counts are relatively small for automobile deaths. This close
correspondence is rather surprising because automobile safety was the primary subject of child
safety regulation during the 1970s and 1980s. These results suggest that improvements in child
safety because of regulations and design changes were offset by increased use of automobiles by
children, or that such safety measures had a relatively minor impact on child mortality. The
finding is consistent with epidemiologic studies that find surprisingly little correlation between the
time series of safety restraint use rates and the time series of automobile fatalities (Agran, Castillo,
and Winn, 1990).
By contrast, the results of the prediction analysis for pedestrian mortality are sharply
higher than actual pedestrian mortality rates. By 1990, the prediction estimates are more than
four times as high as the actual figures. The prediction estimates are higher than extrapolations
based on constant rates mainly because of the substantial increase in labor force participation rates
among mothers of young children. The prediction regressions thus show that pedestrian mortality
was expected to increase somewhat over this period. In fact, pedestrian mortality declined by
14

65%. Epidemiologists have noted the large declines in pedestrian mortality but have not been able
to explain the observed patterns, especially in this younger age group (Rivara and Grossman,
1996).
The prediction regression for deaths from falls (not shown in table) almost precisely
predicts the actual death rate. The prediction for deaths from fires (not shown in table) strongly
underpredicts the actual death rate6. Together with motor vehicle accidents, these two areas are
those where improvements in pediatric trauma care might have been expected to have substantial
effects. The finding that there was relatively less overprediction for these rates than for other
causes suggests that improvements in medical care were not the primary reason for reductions in
death rates in this age group.
The second panel of Table 7 presents results for older children. Again, predicted all cause
mortality is more than twice as high as actual mortality. Differences between extrapolations and
predictions are quite smaller for older children. In general, the prediction errors are slightly larger
than the extrapolation errors.
The decline in automobile passenger mortality among children 6-12 was much steeper
than among younger children and was not predicted by the initial regression. In most states,
children 6-12 were not required to use auto safety restraints during the period under study. Most
children did use such restraints, but use of restraints was less frequent in the older age group than
among younger children (Johnston, Rivara, and Soderberg, 1994). In combination with the
results for 1-5 year olds (who were affected by the regulations), the results for 6-12 year olds
whose behavior was not governed by child safety regulations suggest that regulatory changes
aimed at child safety seat use are not as important an explanation for declines in mortality as might
have been expected. Improvements in trauma treatment may have been an important factor in
reducing mortality in this group.

6

The prediction for drowning deaths is unrealistically high for unknown reasons (the prediction error is
640%).
15

Declines in pedestrian mortality were also steep among older children. Since younger
children have very different walking patterns than older children, the combination of results for
younger and older children suggests that greater use of school crossing guards or similar
interventions cannot explain most of the change in pedestrian mortality. One explanation for the
lower rate of pedestrian injury in older children is that they are less likely to walk to school alone
now than they were 20 years ago (Rivara and Grossman, 1996). This explanation is consistent
with the pattern for older children, but does not explain the similar decline in mortality among
younger children.
Changes in the Production of Child Safety
The discrepancies between the predicted and actual estimates of child mortality suggest
that the decline in child mortality is not simply a consequence of a change in the inputs to health
production. There is also likely to have been a change in the technology for producing child
health. To investigate this possibility, I re-estimate the regressions using data for 1968-1970,
1978-1980, and 1989-1991. I include interaction effects for years after 1968 and for years after
1988. To simplify the comparison, Table 8 reports coefficients for selected variables of interest.
We first examine the changing role of parental time in producing child safety. The effect
of mothers working on child mortality declines over time for most causes of death. The decline in
stronger for older children than for younger children. By 1990, the proportion of mothers
working in a state has essentially no effect on all cause mortality for school children. The results
for the presence of infants in the family (not reported in table) show a similar declining pattern for
both age groups. This result suggests that products and services (including formal day care) are
increasingly valuable alternatives to parental time in the production of child health.
The role of family income varies over time but does not become important over this period
for most causes of death in either age groups. A growing role for family income is likely to occur
when regulations mandate improvements in product quality or when new costly safety-improving
technologies are introduced. For example, higher family income may reduce automobile
passenger deaths if safer cars are more costly than less safe cars.
16

Mother’s education plays a much greater beneficial role in reducing childhood injury after
1970 than in the early period, especially among younger children. This finding is consistent with
the considerable expansion in information about childhood injury that became available in the
1970s and 1980s. Increases in information are likely to widen the gap between less and more
educated families.
We had hypothesized that the presence of older siblings in a family might reduce the safety
of younger children to the extent that families made on time investments in safety technology. I
assess this hypothesis by comparing the effect of the presence of older siblings on mortality
among 1-5 year olds over time. I find that the presence of older siblings placed younger children
at an increasing risk between 1968 and 1978, but this result disappears completely by 1988-1990.
Finally, I examine the hypothesis that regulations aimed at reducing injury in one group led
to increased rates of injury in a different group as parents adjusted their behavior to maintain a
constant level of safety (e.g., Peltzman). I examine the effect of younger siblings (who are most
affected by new regulations) on the mortality of older siblings (6-12 year olds). The presence of
younger siblings never has a substantial or significant positive effect on the mortality of older
children (not shown).
In the regressions estimated here, changes in the efficacy of trauma care would be
expected to lead to overall reductions in childhood mortality, regardless of changes in family
characteristics. In almost all of the cases examined, however, I find no significant change in the
regression intercept after 1970 or after 1980.
Finally, I perform likelihood ratio tests to assess whether the set of interaction coefficients
is jointly significant. I test whether the post-1970 coefficients are significant and whether the
post-1980 coefficients are significant. The likelihood ratio tests confirm that the production
functions for most causes of death changed significantly between the late 1960s and later and
between the late 1970s and late 1980s.

17

V.

The Value of Changes in Child Injury Mortality
We next estimate the value of the changes measured here. I apply a conservative estimate

of $100,000 per life year, or about $3 million as the value of a life lost from injury to the
differences between forecast (extrapolation and prediction) and actual mortality (value of life from
Cutler and Richardson, 1998). This estimate suggests that the total value of savings for young
children amounts to between $8 - $16 billion each year or $430-$870 per child per year. The
value of total savings for older children amounts to between $7 - $9 billion each year, or $280$360 per child per year.
VI. Discussion
Our analysis suggests that there have been several profound changes in the production of
child safety over the past three decades. Formal regulatory interventions, including mandatory car
safety seats and fire alarms, can explain relatively little of what has happened. Rather, the results
suggest that changes in parents’ information about child safety are a more probable cause of the
observed declines in mortality. This is not to say that regulations have been unimportant. They
are likely to have played an important role in providing information to parents and I find no
evidence whatsoever to suggest that they have perverse effects.
Economic theory suggests that information is usually a public good. One type of
information is information about the nature and causes of injury and illness. This type of
information is often produced by publicly-funded epidemiologists and statisticians who simply
examine patterns in the occurrence of events. In many cases, the conclusions of these analyses
seem so straightforward that they hardly seem to present new information at all. Yet the history
of child safety suggests that identifying quite obvious causes of injury, and ranking their relative
importance, is a task that cannot readily be performed by parents. It would not seem necessary to
do a study to show that falling out of windows is bad for children, but the New York City
experience suggests that without such a study few parents recognize the magnitude of the risk.
Once epidemiological information about the risks of injury and the options for responding
to these risks become available, it is disseminated widely (through vehicles such as Dr. Spock and
18

corporations that sell child safety equipment) and consumers appear to act rapidly to make use of
this information. The potential of such apparently basic information is important to recognize
when assessing the role of technological change in social well-being and the role of government in
promoting such technological change.
As information becomes available, it is easier for better educated parents to respond to it.
While my results confirm the importance of information in improving child health, they also
provide an illustration of how socioeconomic differences in health can be produced through the
socially desirable production of valuable information.
