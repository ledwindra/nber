The Demise of U.S. Economic Growth: Restatement, Rebuttal, and Reflections

ABSTRACT
The United States achieved a 2.0 percent average annual growth rate of real GDP per capita between
1891 and 2007. This paper predicts that growth in the 25 to 40 years after 2007 will be much slower,
particularly for the great majority of the population. Future growth will be 1.3 percent per annum
for labor productivity in the total economy, 0.9 percent for output per capita, 0.4 percent for real income
per capita of the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution, and 0.2 percent for the real disposable
income of that group.
The primary cause of this growth slowdown is a set of four headwinds, all of them widely recognized
and uncontroversial. Demographic shifts will reduce hours worked per capita, due not just to the retirement
of the baby boom generation but also as a result of an exit from the labor force both of youth and primeage adults. Educational attainment, a central driver of growth over the past century, stagnates at a
plateau as the U.S. sinks lower in the world league tables of high school and college completion rates.
Inequality continues to increase, resulting in real income growth for the bottom 99 percent of the income
distribution that is fully half a point per year below the average growth of all incomes. A projected
long-term increase in the ratio of debt to GDP at all levels of government will inevitably lead to more
rapid growth in tax revenues and/or slower growth in transfer payments at some point within the next
several decades.
There is no need to forecast any slowdown in the pace of future innovation for this gloomy forecast
to come true, because that slowdown already occurred four decades ago. In the eight decades before
1972 labor productivity grew at an average rate 0.8 percent per year faster than in the four decades
since 1972. While no forecast of a future slowdown of innovation is needed, skepticism is offered
here, particularly about the techno-optimists who currently believe that we are at a point of inflection
leading to faster technological change. The paper offers several historical examples showing that the
future of technology can be forecast 50 or even 100 years in advance and assesses widely discussed
innovations anticipated to occur over the next few decades, including medical research, small robots,
3-D printing, big data, driverless vehicles, and oil-gas fracking.

1. Introduction
A controversy about the future of U.S. economic growth was ignited by my paper
released in late summer 2012. 1 The debate began with my prediction that over some indefinite
period of time into the future, perhaps 25 to 40 years, the growth of real per-capita disposable
income of the bottom 99 percent of the U.S. income distribution would average 0.2 percent per
year, compared to 2.0 percent per year in the century before 2007. 2 This prediction set off a
firestorm of controversy with commentary, blogs, and op-eds around the world.
That paper was explicitly about the U.S. and recognized that there is plenty of room for
“catch-up growth” in the emerging markets of the world. The growth concept is “potential”
real GDP per capita from 2007, not actual real GDP from 2013. It attributed the slowness of
future growth mainly to such “headwinds” as demography, education, inequality, and
government debt. The subtitle “Faltering Innovation and the Six Headwinds” seemed to place
primary emphasis on a future world with no innovation, and the primary role of the headwinds
in predicting slow future growth escaped notice in the initial round of controversy about
innovation.
This sequel paper recasts the debate to focus on the headwinds, which are formidable
for the U.S. economy and may be less important in some other nations. In this sequel, there is
no need to forecast that innovation in the future will “falter,” because the slowdown in the rate
of productivity growth over the past 120 years already occurred more than four decades ago.
This sequel paper explains why the pace of innovation declined after 1972. The future forecast
assumes that innovations in the next 40 years will be developed at the same pace as the last four
decades, but reasons for skepticism are provided for that prediction..
The epochal set of inventions that occurred between 1870 and 1900, with continuing
benefits to 1972, represent the fruits of the “Second Industrial Revolution” (IR #2). The growth
rate of American productivity in the eight decades before 1972 was 2.36 percent per year,
compared to 1.59 percent per year since 1972. That permanent decline of 0.8 percent per year
represents a new way to measure the extent to which the single-dimension digital “Third
Industrial Revolution” (IR #3) has fallen short of the multi-dimensional IR #2. 3
This sequel paper compares the actual condition of the current 2013 U.S. economy with
both optimistic and pessimistic future growth paths. By any measure, the U. S. economy
continues to operate below even the most pessimistic projected post-2007 growth path, and we
shall see that real per-capita income (for everyone, not just the bottom 99%) in 2013 was only
one percent higher than six years earlier.

“Is U. S. Economic Growth Over? Faltering Innovation and the Six Headwinds” (Gordon, 2012).
The 2012 paper, and even more this paper, are careful to distinguish forecast economy-wide productivity growth
of 1.3 percent per year, output per capita for the total population of 0.9 percent per year, income per capita of the
bottom 99% of the income distribution of 0.4% per year, and the disposable income (adjusting for faster tax growth
and slower transfer growth) of 0.2 percent for the bottom 99%.

Industrial Revolution #1, or IR #1, consisted of the invention of the steam engine, the cotton gin, and modern
manufacturing in cotton mills in the period 1870-1820, culminating in the invention of the railroad and steamship.
These IR #1 inventions were gradually eclipsed in most dimensions by IR #2, except for the railroad and steamships.

In addition to providing a new interpretation of the predicted future post-2007 path of
potential real GDP per capita, this sequel paper assesses several different criticisms directed at
the earlier paper. All of these issues involve future innovation, and none of the critics have
denied that the headwinds facing the U.S. economy are formidable. Rather, the headwinds
have largely been ignored by the critics who concur that any skepticism about future innovation
reflects a lack of imagination.
An initial round of criticism pointed to the impossibility of forecasting future
innovations. This paper counters with five historical examples from 1863, 1875, 1900, 1939, and
1949 in which many of the most important innovations of the following 50 to 100 years were
accurately forecast and sketched out in substantial detail. In the same way, every technooptimist has a list of revolutionary inventions that will occur over the next decade or two,
including medical advances, small robots, big data, driverless cars, and oil-gas fracking. It is
legitimate to compare today’s forecasts of future inventions with those late 19th century
inventions that were accurately forecast in 1863 or 1875. Which are more important?
The set of criticisms based on a faith in the future of technology can be simplified if we
use the term “techno-optimists” to describe those who foresee an acceleration in the pace of
innovation to a rate faster than has occurred in the past 40 years. A recent theme of the
optimists has been that official measures of real GDP understate the consumer surplus provided
by free entertainment and information available on the internet. This paper reminds readers
that real GDP measures have always missed vast amounts of consumer surplus since the dawn
of the first industrial revolution almost three centuries ago, and few examples are more
compelling than the replacement of horses and horse manure in urban streets by the motor
vehicle between 1900 and 1930.
This paper points to a contradiction between the actual macro data on productivity
growth and the techno-optimists’ predictions of accelerating growth. They fail to relate the
“exponential growth of Moore’s Law” to the reality that the economy’s productivity
performance for almost 10 years since 2004 shows no evidence of any any stimulus provided by
the explosion of big data or invention of smart phones and tablets. Why should this be
surprising? Marginal cost equals marginal benefit, and as electronic data becomes costless, its
marginal benefit quickly approaches zero.
In the techno-optimist view, technological change is accelerating. Taken literally, this
means that innovation will raise the growth rate of future productivity during 2013-23 faster
than the rate of advance during 2003-13, which in turn must have been faster than the rate of
change during 1993-2003. In contrast, this paper argues that diminishing returns have set in.
Four pieces of evidence are provided that the post-1972 pace of technological change peaked in
1996-2000 and has been slowing down since then.
By its focus on potential real GDP growth after 2007, this paper has nothing to say about
the pace of catch-up of actual real GDP to potential. During the catch-up period that began in
mid-2009, we would exact actual real GDP to grow faster than potential. Because the output

2

gap (the log percentage difference between actual and potential real GDP) remains substantial,
actual real GDP could grow at 3.0 percent or more for several years without contradicting the
forecast of this paper that potential growth over the next 25 to 40 years will be well below 2.0
percent per year. 4

2. The Historical Record: Distinguishing Between Per-Capita Output and
Productivity
The historical record of U. S. growth in real GDP per capita is shown on a log scale in
Figure 1 for the 12 decades between 1891 and 2013. Viewed through this wide-angle lens, the
green line traces the 2.0 percent annual trend achieved between 1891 and 2007 and extends it
out 70 years from 2007 to 2077. 5 The steadiness of the 2.0 percent growth rate appears relentless
and inexorable despite the vicissitudes of the Great Depression and the postwar recessions.
Notice that the wide-angle lens hides the fact that per-capita GDP in 2013 was only 1.1 percent
higher than in 2007, rather than the 12 percent higher implied by a 2.0 percent annual growth
rate.
The “rule of 70” implies that any quantity growing at 2.0 percent per year doubles in 35
years and quadruples in 70 years. Hence the projection of the green line soars from a per-capita
income of $49,387 in 2007 to a much higher $200,273 in 2077. 6
(Figure 1 is at the top of page 4)

4

Census Bureau projections of the total U.S. population imply growth through 2032 of 0.6 to 0.65 percent per year.
Added to our forecast of 0.9 percent annual growth in per capita real GDP, the Census projections imply potential
output growth of 1.50 to 1.55 percent per year.
5
Data revisions since the earlier 2012 paper have nudged up the 1891-2007 growth rate from 2.01 to 2.08. For
expositional convenience the historical growth rate is still summarized here as 2.0 percent per year.
6
All national income data in this paper are in 2009 dollars and reflect the July, 2013, benchmark revisions of the
National Income and Product Accounts. Thus all the numbers in these charts differ from those in the 2012 working
paper. The “Rule of 70” is based on the fact that the natural log of 2.0 is 0.693. Thus a quantity growing at 2.0
percent per year quadruples in 69.3 rather than 70 years. This explains why the 2077 value in Figure 1 is slightly
more than four times higher than the 2007 value.

The organizing principle to understand the significance of the headwinds is a simple
identity:

(1)

Y
Y H
≡
⋅
⋅
N
H N

This relates total output (Real Gross Domestic Product or Y) to aggregate hours of work in the
total economy (H) and the total population (N). It states the truism that the standard of living
measured by output per capita (Y/N) by definition equals labor productivity or output per hour
(Y/H) times hours per capita (H/N).
Any factor that reduces the growth of productivity or of hours per capita must by
definition reduce the growth rate of the standard of living, that is, output per capita. The
headwinds can be introduced by an indication of their role in slowing future growth in percapita real output. The first, demography, reduces hours per capita. It thus drives a wedge
between the growth of productivity and the growth of output per capita. The second headwind
involves education, which directly reduces productivity growth and pari passu translates into
slower per-capita output growth without any necessary implications for hours per capita. The
third headwind is growing inequality, and this does not directly impact any of the terms in

4

equation (1), but rather limits the access of the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution to
the average growth rate of per-capita real GDP. The fourth headwind is the eventual need to
raise the growth rate of government tax rates and/or reduce the growth of transfer payments to
put the budgets of the federal, state, and local branches of government onto a sustainable longrun growth path. This also does not directly impact the elements of equation (1), but rather
reduces the growth of disposable income relative to pre-tax, pre-transfer income.
Two additional headwinds were introduced in the “Is Growth Over?” paper –
globalization and energy/environment. While these are discussed below, no numerical
quantities are proposed here for their impact on future growth.
Figure 2 puts equation (1) into motion by dividing the 122 years since 1891 into four
shorter intervals, with the length of each interval indicated by the width of the bars. The height
of each bar is measured in annual growth rates; the green bar is for productivity, the red bar for
output per capita, and the grey bar for hours per capita. 7

7

The data sources for Figure 2 and all the other charts in this paper combine for output the current NIPA estimates
for 1929-2013, ratio-lined to Kendrick (1961, Table A-IIa) from 1891 to 1929. Hours of work for the total economy
covering 1948-2013 come from an unpublished quarterly BLS series that we obtain on request each quarter, linked
in 1948 to Kendrick’s aggregate “manhours” series going back to 1891 (Kendrick, 1961, Table A-X). The total
population comes from Historical Statistics of the U.S. series Aa7 linked to Census Bureau series since 1999. Total
economy productivity (Y/H) is the ratio of these linked real GDP series to the corresponding real hours series, an
output per capita is the same real GDP series divided by the total population..

5

Each of these four intervals has distinct characteristics. 8 The first for 1891-1972 displays
the normal tendency of hours per capita to decline, by definition forcing output per capita to
grow more slowly than productivity. This relationship was reversed in the next 1972-96
interval, when females moved from home into market work, causing hours per capita to rise by
0.57 percent per year. This allowed output per capita to grow at 1.95 percent per year, that is,
0.57 percent faster than productivity growth. Note that productivity growth itself declined by a
full percentage point between the first two intervals. The entry of females (and also baby-boom
teenagers) into the labor force allowed real GDP per capita to grow during 1972-96 almost as
rapidly as in 1891-1972, even though productivity growth was substantially slower.
The most fertile subperiod of IR #3 occurred between 1996 and 2004. Productivity
growth in Figure 2 soared between the second and third periods from 1.38 to 2.54 percent per
year, enough to lift per-capita output growth to 2.18 percent despite a historically
unprecedented decline in hours per capita at an annual rate of 0.36 percent per year. What is
notable about the third period of 1996-2004 is not only how short-lived was the productivity
revival associated with the invention of e-mail, the internet, the web, and e-commerce, but also
how part of this short-lived productivity revival was offset by the beginning of a historic decline
in hours per capita.
Everything collapsed after 2004. Productivity growth returned from its temporary 19962004 growth rate of 2.54 to a mere 1.33 percent in the nine years ending in 2013. Hours per
capita declined at an annual rate of more than half of a percentage point per year, leaving the
standard of living to grow at its slowest rate of the four periods in Figure 2, a mere 0.76 percent
per year.
A possible reaction is that the abysmal results for 2004-2013 can be ignored, because “it’s
all due to the recession and slow recovery.” Unfortunately, the collapse of productivity growth
cannot be so easily dismissed, because productivity growth is no longer procyclical. My own
econometric research and that of others demonstrates that the previous procyclical responses of
productivity changed after the mid 1980s, and that productivity growth now has no regular
relationship to the business cycle. 9
What accounts for the decline of hours per capita after 1996? By definition, the ratio of
hours per capita is equal to hours per employee, times the ratio of employment to the labor
force (that is, unity minus the unemployment rate expressed in decimals), times the labor-force
participation rate. In symbols, H/N ≡ H/E * E/L * L/N. The table below calculates the 1996-2013
8

Data displayed in Figure 2 differ from charts displayed in presentations and speeches over the past year by
repairing inconsistencies. Previous charts mixed the total population for 1891-1948 with the working-age
population for 1948 to the present, whereas all charts in this paper are based on the total population. The data in this
paper also extend the analysis to 2013 and incorporate the July, 2013, revision of the national accounts and all recent
revisions up to December 5, 2013, in BLS data on aggregate hours of work in the total economy from 1948:Q1 to
2013:Q3. Another difference is that all growth rates here are calculated from annual average levels, whereas
postwar growth rates in the 2012 paper were calculated between the first quarters of the listed years, e.g., 1948:Q11972:Q1.

growth rates of the components of this definition, taking note that there are two alternative
definitions of the population. The first is the total population of the United States, 316.1 million
in 2013. The second is the working-age population aged 16 and higher, 245.7 million in 2013.
The difference is made up of children between ages zero to 15.

Components of Hours per Capita, Annual Growth Rates 1996-2013

2 Payroll Hours / Household Employment (H/E)

-0.28
-0.13
-0.32
+0.25

6 Payroll Hours / Working-Age Population (H/WAP)

-0.72

Shown in the table are two quite different growth rates for hours per capita (H/N). The
rate of decline is substantially faster when the population is defined as those aged 16+ than
when data for the total population are used. This distinction matters for forecasts, as
population growth over the 2015-2050 period is predicted to be roughly 0.6 percent per year for
both the total and working-age population concepts. 10 The historical behavior of hours relative
to the working-age population is what matters to guide forecasts, since hours of work for
children aged 0 to 15 are meaningless. Differences in the growth rates of the total and workingage population reflect short-term variations in birth and death rates and the pace of
immigration rather than workplace-related decisions of those aged 16 and older.
During the interval 1996-2013 the employment rate (100 percent minus the
unemployment rate) declined at an annual rate of -0.13 percent. For long-run forecasts, the
employment rate should be roughly constant over decades and so its rate of change should be
zero. Payroll hours divided by household employment (H/E) declined at the relatively rapid
rate of -0.28 percent per year during 1996-2013, reflecting the continuing pressure by firms to
force their employees into part-time work, as well as an ongoing preference by some groups in
the population for part-time work.
The largest component of change was in the labor-force participation rate, which
changed over this interval at an annual rate of -0.32 percent per year. Since the retirement of the
baby-boomers had hardly started until the very end of the 1996-2013 interval, this relatively
rapid rate of decline in the L/N ratio reflects the continuing process of labor-force drop-out by
adults and youth discussed below, only a small part of which is explained by increased
participation by youth in higher education.

3. A Restatement of the Case for Slow Future Growth: The Headwinds
The 2012 paper emphasized the contrast between IR #2 and IR #3, providing many
examples to explain why the set of inventions that created a new world between 1870 and 1970
could not be repeated. The role of the headwinds in slowing recent and future growth was an
afterthought, treated at the end of that paper. This sequel reverses this ordering, since the
headwinds are both more important and less controversial. The role of the headwinds is
discussed in this section, and later we turn to the role of innovation in the past, its slowdown
four decades ago, and its likely behavior in the future.
3.1 The First Headwind: Demography
A standard assumption in every economic forecast is that the retirement of the baby
boomers will reduce hours per capita independently of any other cause. The denominator of
the H/N ratio is the total population. Whenever a person retires, he or she remains in the
population while making a transition from positive to zero hours of market work. The babyboom retirement phenomenon matters because of the bulge in the fertility rate extending from
1946 to 1964. The 1946 babies were eligible for early Social Security status at age 62, that is, in
2008, while the oldest group born in 1964 will be eligible for full benefits at age 70 in 2034. That
period, 2008-2034, represents a full quarter of a century in which baby-boom retirement will
drag down hours per capita.
But that is not all. Even if the future unemployment rate returns to its 2004 value of 5.5
percent and the employment rate returns to 94.5 percent, there will still be downward pressure
on the other two components of hours per capita, namely hours per employee and the laborforce participation rate. The former has been reduced in part by America’s dysfunctional
medical care insurance system, which ties medical insurance to employment rather than
providing it as a right of citizenship. Firms have increasingly pushed employees into part-time
status in order to avoid paying medical insurance costs, and today roughly eight million
Americans are involuntarily working part-time while seeking full-time employment.
A unique feature of the slow 2009-2013 economic recovery has been the fact that the
employment rate has been steadily improving while the participation rate has been declining,
so that there has been virtually no improvement in the employment-to-population ratio (E/N
≡E/L*L/N). In fact, over the four years of recovery between December 2009 and December 2013,
the employment rate increased from 90.1 to 93.3 percent, but the E/N ratio barely budged from
58.3 to 58.6 percent (this compares to prior peaks of 64.4 percent in 2000 and 63.0 percent in
2007. The decline in the labor-force participation rate has prevented any recovery in the
employment-population ratio.
The decline in the participation rate involves more than just baby-boom retirement. In
late July, 2013, President Obama toured several rust-belt cities which have lost most of their
manufacturing jobs base. Cities like Galesburg IL, Scranton PA, and Syracuse NY are now
mainly reliant on government, health-care, and retail jobs. In Scranton 41.3 percent of those

8

over 18 have withdrawn from the work force, while in Syracuse that percentage is an even
higher 42.4 percent. 11
The devastating effect of manufacturing plant closures throughout the Midwest is
captured by remarks of the newly appointed British Consul-General in Chicago, who toured the
Midwest during the autumn of 2013 in the first three months of his four-year term. Asked for
impressions of his travels, he said “what surprised me most was the deterioration and decay of
the former one-factory small and middle-sized manufacturing towns.” 12 Asked for a
comparison with Northern England, he responded that Northern English towns are much closer
together so are not dependent on any individual factory, and that immigration from India and
Pakistan had done much to revive them.
What does the 1996-2013 experience, as recorded above in the in-text table, imply for the
future? Holding the employment rate constant, hours per capita for the working-age
population declined at -0.60 percent per year, combining the -0.28 rate of decline for hours per
employee and the -0.32 rate of decline for the labor-force participation rate. Since baby-boom
retirement began only at the end of this time interval, a forecast for the participation rate would
anticipate a more rapid rate of decline than occurred since 1996. However, part of the declining
participation rate of prime-age adults and youth may reflect the depressed labor market of 2013
and may reverse as prosperity returns in the future.
Over the historical period 1891-2007, hours relative to the total population declined at
only about -0.1 percent per year. For our projections, we take the conservative choice of -0.4
percent per year in the future in preference to the actual -0.6 percent per year registered during
1996-2013 by the sum of the rates of decline of hours per employee and the labor-force
participation rate. Thus the first demographic “headwind” subtracts -0.3 percent per year from
future growth over the next few decades following 2007 as compared to the -0.1 percent rate of
change experienced during 1891-2007.
3.2 The Second Headwind: Education
Since Edward Denison’s (1962) first attempt, growth accounting has recognized the role
of increasing educational attainment as a source of economic growth. Goldin and Katz (2008)
estimate that educational attainment increased by 0.8 years per decade over the eight decades
between 1890 and 1970. Over this period they also estimate that the improvement in
educational attainment contributed 0.35 percentage points per year to the growth of
productivity and output per capita. In separate research, I have adjusted Denison’s estimates
for 1913-79 to current BLS methodology and find an average contribution of education of 0.38
percent per year, almost identical to that of Goldin and Katz.

November 20, 2013.

The increase of educational attainment has two parts, that referring to secondary
education and the other relevant for higher education. The surge in high-school graduation
rates — from less than 10 percent of youth in 1900 to 80 percent by 1970 — was a central driver
of 20th century economic growth. But the percentage of 18-year-olds receiving bona fide high
school diplomas has since fallen, to 74 percent in 2000, according to James Heckman. He found
that the economic outcomes of those who earned not a high school diploma but rather a General
Education Development (GED) certificate performed no better economically than high-school
dropouts and that the drop in graduation rates could be explained, in part, by the rising share of
youth who are in prison rather than in school. 13 The United States currently ranks 11th among
the developed nations in high school graduation rates and is the only country in which the
graduation rates of those aged 25-34 is no higher than those aged 55-64. 14
The role of education in holding back future economic growth is evident in the poor
quality of educational outcomes at the secondary level. A UNICEF report lists the U.S. 18th out
of 24 countries in the percentage of secondary students that rank below a fixed international
standard in reading and math. The international PISA tests in 2013, again referring to
secondary education, rated the U.S. as ranked 21st in reading, 24th in science, and 31st in math. A
recent evaluation by the ACT college entrance test organization showed that only 25 percent of
high school students were prepared to attend college with adequate scores on reading, math,
and science.
At the college level longstanding problems of quality are joined with the newer issues of
affordability and student debt. In most of the postwar period a low-cost college education was
within reach of a larger fraction of the population than in any other nation, thanks to free
college education made possible by the GI Bill, and also minimal tuition for in-state students at
state public universities and junior colleges. The U. S. led the world during most of the last
century in the percentage of youth completing college. The percentage of 25-year-olds who
have earned a BA degree from a four-year college has inched up in the past 15 years from 25 to
30 percent, but that is ranked now 16th among developed nations.
And the future does not look promising. The cost of a university education has risen
since 1972 at more than triple the overall rate of inflation. 15 Between 2001 and 2012 funding by
states and localities for higher education declined by fully one-third when adjusted for inflation.
In 1985 the state of Colorado provided 37 percent of the budget of the University of Colorado,
but last year provided only 9 percent. Presidents of Ivy League colleges and other elite schools
point to the lavish subsidies they provide as tuition discounts for low- and middle-income

An update of high school graduation rates is provided in Murnane (2013). He concurs with Heckman that the
graduation rate declined from 1970 to 2000 but presents data that there was an increase during 2000 to 2010. The
2010 graduation rate is slightly higher than in 1970 but the conclusion remains that high-school completion rates
have stagnated for the past 40 years, particularly in comparison to the prior period between 1900 and 1970.

A comparison from the detailed NIPA tables of personal consumption expenditures suggests that the rise in the
relative price of the higher education deflator compared to the personal consumption deflator emerges as an increase
of 3.7 times conventional PCE inflation since 1972.

students, but this leaves behind the vast majority of American college students who are not
lucky or smart enough to attend these elite institutions.
Even when account is taken of the discounts from full-tuition made possible by
scholarships and fellowships, the current level of American college completion has been made
possible only by a dramatic rise in student borrowing. Americans owe $1 trillion in college
debt. While a four-year college degree still pays off in a much higher income and lower risk of
unemployment than for high-school graduates, still about one-quarter of college graduates will
not obtain a college-level job in the first few years after graduation. “Dear graduate, face your
future as an indebted taxicab driver or barista.”
Students taking on large amounts of student debt face two kinds of risks. One is that
they fall short of the average income achieved by the typical college graduate, through some
combination of unemployment after college and an inability to find a job in the chosen field of
study. Research has shown that on average a college student taking on $100,000 in student debt
will still come out ahead by age 34, with the higher income made possible by college completion
high enough to offset the debt repayment. But that break-even age becomes older if future
income falls short of the average graduate. There is also completion risk. A student who takes
out half as much debt but drops out after two years never breaks even because wages of college
drop-outs are little better than those of high-school graduates. These risks are particularly
relevant for high-achieving students from low-income families -- Stanford’s Caroline Hoxby has
shown that they seldom apply to elite colleges, which are prepared to fund them completely
without debt, so they wind up at sub-par colleges loaded with debt (Hoxby-Avery 2013).
The poor achievement of American high school graduates spills over to their
performance in college education. Many of the less capable enter two-year community colleges,
which currently enroll 39 percent of American undergraduates, whereas the remaining 61
percent enroll in four-year colleges. The Center on International Education Benchmarking
reports that only 13 percent of students in two-year colleges graduate in two years, although the
percentage rises to 28 percent after four years. The low graduation rates reflect the need for
most students to work part-time or full-time in addition to their college classes, and also the
poor preparation of the secondary graduates who enter community colleges. Most community
college students take one or more remedial courses.
As a result of stagnation of educational attainment, Harvard’s Dale Jorgenson has
estimated that education’s growth contribution will decline in the future by 0.27 percent per
year. Jorgenson’s estimate has become a consensus view, being adopted in the latest series of
sources-of-growth projections by Bryne, Oliner, and Sichel (2013). In assessing the importance
of the headwinds for future growth, we conservatively mark down the Jorgenson -0.27 growth
subtraction to -0.2 percent per year. Together with the -0.3 percentage point subtraction for
demography, this brings predicted future growth of real GDP per capita down from 2.0 to 1.5
percent per year.
3.3 The Third Headwind: Inequality

11

The share of the top one percent of the income distribution was high during the early
years of the historical record from 1913 to 1929, fell dramatically to a much lower level during
the 1950s through early 1970s, and has increased steadily since the late 1970s until it once again
has reached the high share of 1913-29. Thus when we calculate growth rates of real income for
the bottom 99 percent of the distribution, they are the same as the average when 2007 is
compared with 1913, but they are substantially lower than the average over the past three
decades. The web site of Emmanuel Saez reports that between 1993 and 2012, the average
growth rate of real income for the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution was 0.53 percent
slower than for the average of all income recipients. My adjustment for the effect of inequality
in the future assumes that the widening of the income distribution continues at a rate that
causes the growth of real income of the bottom 99 percent to grow 0.5 percent per year slower
than the average.
Another indicator of the sharp divide between median and average real income growth
is provided in the Census series on median real household income. Expressed in 2011 dollars
real median household income in 2012 was $52,100, below the 1998 level of $53,700. For median
household income to exhibit no growth over the past 14 years provides evidence beyond the
Saez tax-based data that real income growth in middle America has already reached zero. For
many Americans my pessimistic predictions for the future have already become a fact.
Recently there has been substantial publicity for the plight of fast-food workers, most of
whom are paid little more than the minimum wage. The bottom 20 percent of American
workers classified by income earn less than $9.89 per hour, and their inflation-adjusted wage
fell by five percent between 2006 and 2012, while average pay for the median worker fell 3.4
percent. Holding down wages is an explicit corporate strategy at retail firms like Wal-Mart,
which hires only temporary workers to fill job openings and forces many of its workers onto
part-time shifts. 16 Similarly, the Wall Street Journal writes that
Economic changes over the past decade have led to a decline across the country
in well-paying jobs, such as those in manufacturing, and an increase in jobs that
pay less, such as those in hotels and food services . . . Positions are increasingly
being filled not with the young and inexperienced, but by older and more
skilled workers who can’t find other jobs. 17
The Caterpillar corporation has become the poster child of rising inequality. It has
broken strikes in order to enforce a two-tier wage system in which new hires are paid half of
existing workers, even though both groups are members of the same labor union. In contrast
there was an 80 percent increase over the past two years in the compensation of Caterpillar’s
CEO, whose quoted mantra is “we can never make enough money . . . we can never make
enough profit.” 18

Foreign companies like Volkswagen continue to open plants in the non-union right-towork states; by lowering wages as compared to the union-dominated northern states, this
surely helps to keep overall U.S. manufacturing employment from declining further. But this
countervailing pressure against continuing manufacturing employment is contingent on
maintaining worker wages at about half the level that the auto union had achieved for its
workers before the bankruptcy of General Motors and Chrysler. In the 2009-2013 recovery,
manufacturing regained only 600,000 of the 6 million jobs that had been lost since 2001, and
most of those were contingent on hiring workers at wage rates that were much lower than were
common in manufacturing as recently as 2001. 19
And the downward pressure on wages at the bottom and middle continues, with
Boeing’s threats to move the manufacturing of its latest 777-X model away from the unionized
Seattle area after the Seattle union workers rejected a contract that called for a wage freeze, a
reduction in company-paid medical benefits, and a transition from the previous defined-benefit
pension plan to a new IRA-type defined contribution plan. After Boeing offered a new contract
proposal that was slightly more favorable to the workers, they voted narrowly and reluctantly
to accept the reductions in wages and pension contributions in order to preserve their jobs.
Any optimist who thinks that the rise of inequality has ended is not paying attention to
the deterioration of the social and economic condition of Americans, as family breakup and
breakdown deprive millions of children of the traditional support of a two-parent household.
Charles Murray’s Coming Apart (2012) documents the decline of every relevant social indicator
for the bottom third of the white population.
Murray admirably presents his data in a series of charts from government data sources
that uniformly extend from 1960 to 2010. For the bottom one-third of the white population the
percentage of married couples where either one or the other spouse worked 40 or more hours in
the previous week declined from 84 percent in 1960 to 58 percent in 2010. The breakup of the
family is documented by three complementary indicators all referring to the 30-49 age group:
percent married down from 85 to 48 percent, percent never married up from 8 to 25 percent,
and percent divorced up from 5 to 33 percent.
The most devastating statistic of all is that for mothers aged 40, the percentage of
children living with both biological parents declined from 95 percent in 1960 to 34 percent in
2010. Children living in a single parent family, usually with the mother as the head of
household, are more likely to suffer from poverty and lack of motivation, and are more likely to
drop out of high school. The educational and inequality headwinds interact in a multiplicative
way and predict a continuing slippage of the U.S. in the international league tables of high
school college completion rates. .
In previous sections we have reduced the future growth rate of per-capita income from
the historic pre-2007 growth rate of 2.0 per year to 1.5 percent as a result of the demographic

19

13

and education headwinds. The inexorable rise of inequality reduces prospective future growth
further by 0.5 percent, from 1.5 to 1.0 percent per year, for the bottom 99 percent of the income
distribution. There is room for debate as to whether the gap between the top one percent and
the bottom 99 percent will continue at the same rate as in the past two decades, but there is no
doubt that it is continuing to rise. 20
3.4 The Fourth Headwind: Repaying Debt
The future reckoning for the indebtedness of government at the federal, state, and local
levels will arrive at some unknown year over the next several decades. While the Congressional
Budget Office currently estimates that the federal ratio of debt to GDP will stabilize between
2014 and 2020, its optimism is based on unrealistically optimistic economic forecasts.
But even the CBO projects that trouble lies ahead beyond 2020. The Medicare trust fund
is predicted to reach a zero balance in 2026, while the zero-balance date for Social Security has
steadily advanced (due to slow economic growth and larger disability claims) from the
projected 2047 date estimated six years ago to the latest projected zero-balance date of 2033. By
definition any stabilization of the federal debt-GDP ratio, compared to its likely steady increase
with current policies, will require more rapid growth in future taxes and/or slower growth in
transfer payments. This is the fourth headwind, the near-inevitability that over the next several
decades the disposable income of the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution will decline
relative to the average real income before transfers of the same bottom 99 percent group.
A sole focus on the federal debt ignores the unfunded pension liabilities of many of
America’s states and localities. The bankruptcy of Detroit has led municipal bond experts to
ask whether Illinois and Chicago could be far behind, not to mention other large states with
massive unfunded pension liabilities. The projection in this paper that future growth in tax
rates and/or slower growth of government transfers will reduce the growth rate of disposable
income in the future by 0.2 percent is admittedly arbitrary but a reasonable number in face of
the risks.
Starting from the 2.0 percent annual growth rate of real per-capita GDP between 1891
and 2007, we have now subtracted 0.3 percentage points for demography, 0.2 for education, 0.5
for inequality, and 0.2 for future fiscal corrections. This brings the total down to 0.8 percent
even though no mention has yet been made of innovation or productivity growth. These four
headwinds alone are sufficient to cut likely future U. S. economic growth by more than half,
again with the careful qualification that this future projection refers to the disposable income of the
bottom 99 percent of the income distribution, not the average per-capita income of the nation as a
whole.
We started with the green projected line growing at 2.0 percent per year. This was
sufficient to bring the level of real per-capita output to $200,273 in 2077. Now, with the
20

The income share of the top one percent exhibits fluctuations that reflect the ups and downs of the stock market.
The 32 percent gain of the S&P 500 stock market index in 2013 (including dividends) assures that the income share
of the top one percent will reach a new high in 2013 relative to previous local maximums in 2000 and 2007.

14

adjustment for the four headwinds, the 2077 projection is a much lower $86,460, as shown in
Figure 3.

3.5 Other Headwinds
The 2012 working paper included two additional headwinds called “globalization” and
“energy/environment.” There is no need to quantify their possible future influence, as the
headwinds discussed above are sufficient to validate the pessimistic forecasts contained in the
2012 paper. This section places these additional headwinds in perspective.
Globalization is difficult to disentangle from other sources of rising inequality. Plant
closings caused by off-shoring are also responsible for part of the demographic headwind by
causing prime-age workers to leave the labor force when their one-factory town experiences a
plant closure. There has been a major loss of high- paying manufacturing jobs that long
antedates the 2008 financial crisis and 2007-09 recession. Charles, Hurst, and Notowidigdo
(2013) have shown that roughly half of the seven million person loss of manufacturing jobs
between 2000 and 2011 occurred before 2008. The time period 2000-07 witnessed the maximum
impact of the increase in Chinese manufacturing capacity that flooded the U.S. with imports,

15

boosted the trade deficit, and caused plant closings and ended the chance of millions of workers
to enjoy middle-income wages with no better than a high-school diploma. According to their
analysis, the only reason that the economy experienced an economic expansion rather than
contraction in the years leading up to 2007 was the housing bubble which allowed many of the
displaced manufacturing workers to obtain temporary jobs in the construction industry.
Globalization is also responsible for rising inequality through another channel. The U.S.
has benefitted from foreign investment, particularly in the auto industry, but this has been
directed almost exclusively at the right-to-work states, largely in the south, where foreign firms
are free to pay workers whatever they want. Wages of $15 to $20 per hour, compared to the old
standard of $30 to $40 per hour achieved before 2007 in union states like Michigan and Ohio,
are welcomed by residents of the southern states as manna from heaven, and new plant
openings are greeted by long lines of hopeful workers at the hiring gates. Globalization is
working as in the classic economic theory of factor price equalization, raising wages in
developing countries and slowing their growth in the advanced nations.
Another headwind discussed in the 2012 paper was “energy/environment.” This set of
complementary topics remains highly controversial. Optimistic pundits point to vast new fields
of gas and oil made possible by fracking as fundamentally changing the competitiveness of
American industry by creating a cheap source of energy that is not available to other countries
outside the North American continent.
The first distinction to make is between oil fracking and gas fracking. The price of oil is
set in world markets, and so additional oil discoveries that may ultimately make the U. S. oilindependent have no impact on the price of oil in the world and in the U.S. That depends on
the worldwide balance of oil demand and supply. In mid-January 2014 the price of West Texas
crude oil was $94 per barrel compared to $11 per dollar in February 1999. The sustained
increase in the price of crude oil over the past decade, due in large part to the increased demand
from China and other emerging economies, hangs as an ominous shadow over current and
future U. S. economic growth. Higher oil prices raise not just gasoline prices at the pump and
increase airline fares, draining household disposable income, but increase manufacturing costs
for any product based on petroleum, including most types of plastics.
Because natural gas cannot be easily transported between continents, the gas fracking
revolution in the U.S. is more of a boon. But this is not a positive boost to productivity in the
sense of the invention of commercial aviation, air conditioning, or the interstate highway
system. Rather, the cheaper price of gas that is unique to the North American continent will
help offset the rising cost of oil and will lead to a welcome substitution of gas not just for oil but
for coal, helping to reduce the growth of carbon emissions as well as reducing costs in energyintensive industries. Gas fracking represents an example of an innovation that has recently
occurred and will continue into the future, but its overall impact is to provide an offset to higher
oil prices, not as a new independent source of economic growth analogous to electricity or the
motor vehicle. Gas fracking has been a boon to employment in North Dakota but has caused
despair in the coal-mining areas of Kentucky and West Virginia.

It is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the large topic of global warming and
environmental policy. While the extent and likely effects of global warming are subject to
debate, there is little doubt that they are occurring and will create weather events – whether
coastal flooding or more frequent and violent tornadoes – that will reduce future economic
growth and raise insurance premia. Future carbon taxes and direct regulatory inventions like
the CAFÉ fuel-economy standards will divert investment from true innovations into research
that has the sole purpose of improving energy efficiency and fuel economy. Economic or
regulatory pressures that force households and firms with machinery or consumer appliances
that are operationally equivalent but more energy-efficient, at substantial capital cost, are
quantitatively and qualitatively different than the early 20th century innovations that replaced
the ice-box by the electric refrigerator or replaced the horse by the car.
One of the world’s great experts on global warming, William Nordhaus (2013) has
quantified its effects on economic growth. A stunning aspect of his research is that the impact
of a 3 degree (C) warming in the global temperature in the next 70 years would reduce global
real GDP per capita by only around 2.5 percent. 21 That translates as an annual subtraction of
growth of -2.5/70 or 0.036 of a percentage point per year, trivial compared to the estimates in
this paper of a negative impact of -0.3 percent for demography and -0.2 percent for education.
Nordhaus’ estimates are based on a hypothetical failure of worldwide policy to take explicit
new measures to fight global warming.
One last headwind was not discussed in the 2012 paper nor is it pursued here. The
unique American decision as a society to base medical care insurance on the status of
employment, instead of making medical care protection a right of citizenship, reduces the
current and future efficiency of the American economy by as much as six or seven percent of
GDP. David Cutler and Dan Ly (2011) have calculated that if the U.S. had the same ratio of
medical care expenses to GDP as does Canada, the level of U. S. medical care expenditure
would be lower by $1 trillion per year. A medical care system on the Canadian model would
not only save enormous resources that could be devoted to other social purposes but would
raise life expectancy by allowing the entire population access to preventive medical care. 22

4. Comparing Current Per-Capita Real GDP with Optimistic and Pessimistic
Projections
All the projections in this paper compare the 2.0 realized growth rate of U. S. per-capita
real GDP between 1891 and 2007 with alternative forecasts beyond 2007. The horizon date of
2077 is chosen for arithmetic convenience related to the “rule of 70.” If real GDP per capita
were to continue to grow at 2.0 percent per year, it would quadruple between 2007 and 2077.

21

Thanks to Bill Nordhaus for correcting the numbers in this sentence. He reports that this calculation is based on
the DICE-2013R model. DICE stands for “Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy.”
22
According to the World Health Organization, Canada is tied in fourth place with a life expectancy at birth of 82
years, while the U.S. is tied in 33rd place with a life expectancy of 79 years.

17

We are not in 2077 to assess the outcome, but rather we are near the beginning of the
forecast period. The red line in Figure 4 displays the level of actual real per-capita GDP through
2013:Q3 and compares the actual outcome with the optimistic (green line) forecast that growth
after 2007 will continue at 2.0 percent and the pessimistic (black line) forecast of 0.8 percent
growth after 2007. This comparison is biased in favor of the actual outcome to date, because the
data plotted are average real GDP per capita rather than the realized income of the bottom 99%
which is the focus of the pessimistic forecast. Nevertheless it is enlightening to see how far is
the economy below the 0.8 percent post-2007 growth path, much less the 2.0 percent post-2007
growth path.
If per-capita real GDP had grown at 2.0 percent after 2007:Q4, then by 2013:Q3 the
amount would have increased to $56,243. Yet the actual amount of $50,022 fell short of the
optimistic prediction by 11.7 percent, and it even was 3.5 percent below the pessimistic blackline forecast that takes account of growing inequality. It is easy to dismiss these ratios as
“transitory” because the economy is mired in a “slow recovery.” Meanwhile, when growing
inequality is considered, median real household income still remains below its value in 1998.

18

5. A Restatement of the Innovation Contribution and Its Future
5.1 The Data Since 1891
The pessimistic forecast in this paper for future U.S. economic growth in the disposable
income of the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution does not depend on any skepticism
about the pace of future innovation. The forecasts here are consistent with a continuation of
innovation at the pace of 1972-2013, which produced productivity growth substantially slower
than the eight prior decades of 1891-1972. We start from the historical record displayed above
in Figure 2 on the growth rates of productivity, output per person, and hours per person over
the four intervals 1891-1972, 1972-96, 1996-2004, and 2004-2013. Now we simplify that graph to
show only the growth rates for productivity, that is, total economy output per hour, over the
same intervals as in Figure 2.
When the time intervals are divided in this way, we discover an important fact about
historical productivity growth that has not been widely recognized. American history since
1891 can be divided into two “good” (i.e., green) intervals and two “bad” (i.e., blue) intervals.
In my interpretation IR #2 of the late 19th century and all of its complementary inventions that
extended until 1972 created an unbroken chain of 81 years in which productivity grew fast
enough to double every 29 years. There was a distinct watershed at 1972 for reasons discussed
below, and the following 41 years include the two blue periods interrupted for only 8 years by
the green productivity growth interval associated with the invention of the internet, web, and ecommerce. Subsequently we will examine other dimensions of the 1996-2004 period that make
it unique and unlikely to be repeated.
The post-1972 slowdown which lasted until 1996 created its own large literature on the
cause or causes of the slowdown, containing speculation about energy prices, infrastructure,
education, and much else. Robert Solow in 1987 captured the frustration created by the slow
pace of productivity growth by quipping “We can see the computer revolution everywhere but
in the productivity statistics.” But soon the revolution began to revive the productivity statistics
– it took the experts a few years to wake up, but the post-1995 revival was first noticed in early
1999 and then popped into widespread recognition with the benchmark revisions of the
National Income and Product Accounts that occurred in July, 1999.

19

However, the internet-led productivity revival did not last long, and thus was a big
disappointment compared to the eight-decade stretch of rapid productivity growth between
1891 and 1972.. The boom of the late 1990s was driven by an unprecedented and neverrepeated rate of decline in the price of computer speed and memory (see Figure 10 below), and
a never-since matched surge in the share of GDP devoted to information and communication
technology (ICT) investment. The ICT share in GDP declined along with the stock market in
2000-2002, leaving a subsidiary mystery of why productivity growth continued to be so strong
until early 2004. Convincing research by Erik Brynjolfsson and his colleagues suggested that
there was a substantial lag between the production and purchase of computer investment and
the learning curve of how to use all the new equipment efficiently and productively. 23 One of
many examples was the installation in airport lobbies of electronic check-in kiosks, a product of
late 1990s technology that was not implemented until 2001-04.
The further time moves forward year after year beyond that golden 1996-2004 interval,
the more clear it becomes that the effect of the internet in creating IR #3 provided only a
temporary boost to productivity growth. Why is the effect of computers not visible in the
productivity statistics for 1972-96? Mainframe computers created bank statements and phone
bills in the 1960s, airline reservation systems in the 1970s, personal computers, ATMs, and barcode scanning in the 1980s, all before the internet revolution of the 1990s. The slow growth of
productivity evident in the Figure for 1972-96 indicates that the contributions of the first round
23

See Brynjolfsson, Hitt, and Yang (2002).

20

of computer applications partially masked an even more severe slowdown in productivity
growth than would have occurred without the contribution of the early applications of
computers.
The final blue bar in Figure 5 displays productivity growth over the nine-year period
2004-2013 and reinforces the finding that the dot.com boom period of the late 1990s was unique
and thus far has not been repeated. The growth rate of output per hour during 2004-2013 was
slightly slower than the “dismal” productivity growth slowdown” of 1972-96.

It is easy to average the blue and green post-1972 areas displayed in Figure 5, and the
resulting average for 1972-2013 provides a succinct summary of the relative contributions of IR
#2 and IR #3 in creating productivity growth. Output per hour in the total economy grew at
2.36 percent per year from 1891 to 1972 and then at 1.59 percent from 1972 to 2013. Thus in the
past 41 years output per hour grew at 2/3 of the rate of the 81 years prior to 1972. Since the
post-1972 interval is half the time duration of the earlier 81-year interval, the result is that the
pre-1972 years contributed fully three-quarters of the cumulative gain in productivity growth
since 1891.
It is conventional in growth accounting to subdivide the observed growth in output per
hour into the separate contributions of capital deepening, improvements in capital quality,
improvements in labor quality through education and training, and a residual term called “total

21

factor productivity” (TFP), sometimes described as “a measure of our ignorance.” Yet capital
deepening and changes in capital quality are not separate sources of growth, but rather a sideeffect of innovation. As Evsey Domar famously remarked in 1961, “without technological
change, capital accumulation would amount to piling wooden plows on top of wooden plows.”
Similarly, changes in capital quality reflect the shift from long-lived structures which exhibit
little technical change to shorter-lived equipment, particularly computers, which are short-lived
precisely because rapid innovation makes them quickly obsolescent.
If capital deepening and changes in capital quality are endogenous to innovation, then
this leaves only two sources of labor productivity growth, namely innovation and
improvements in labor quality achieved by increased educational attainment. These two
sources of economic growth, together with Figure 6, form the basis of my forecast of future
productivity growth.

In previous sections we have subtracted the effect of four headwinds from the 2.0
percent per annum growth of per-capita real GDP from 1891 to 2007. We reached a rate of 0.8
percent per year after subtracting from the demographic, education, inequality, and debt
headwinds. How much should we subtract for the slowdown of innovation after 1972? The
growth rate of output per hour was 2.2 percent between 1891 and 2007, as compared to the 1.6
percent that we predict for the next 40 years on the basis of the actual performance since 1972.
That amounts to a subtraction for innovation of about 0.6 percent a year, bringing future growth

22

in the per-capita disposable real income of the bottom 99% of the income distribution down
from the 0.8 percent implied by the headwinds to 0.2 percent. Figure 7 summarizes the five
different sources of subtraction that lead us from 2.0 to 0.2 percent.
5.2 What Was the Second Industrial Revolution?
The achievements of the Second Industrial Revolution were set out in the 2012 paper
and need only be summarized here. Within three months in the year 1879 three of the most
fundamental “general purpose technologies” were invented that spun off scores of inventions
that changed the world. Two of these are well known but the third is not. In October, 1879,
Thomas Edison created the first working electric light bulb and by 1882 was distributing power
by wire to customers in lower Manhattan, a revolution that made possible not only electric
light, elevators, high-rise cities, stationary and portable electric power tools, consumer
appliances, but also air conditioning that transformed life and work, especially in the American
South.
Between 1890 and 1930 the American household became fully “networked,” replacing
its previous isolation by five types of connections – electricity, gas, telephone, running water,
and sewer pipes. Running water and sewers in turn contributed not just to the first phase of
female liberation but also laid the foundations for the conquest of infant mortality in the first
half of the 20th century.
Two months after Edison’s electric light, Karl Benz achieved the first reliable and
workable internal combustion engine, and his initial patent is dated 1879. The third great
invention of that year is less known – an Englishman named David Edward Hughes succeeded
in sending a wireless signal several hundred meters in London almost two decades before
Marconi won his earliest wireless patents (Smil, 2005, p. 241).
The diffusion process of the epochal inventions of electricity and the internal
combustion engine was surprisingly similar. Electricity had little initial impact before 1900
except in showpiece displays like the 1893 Chicago Columbian Exposition and the interior of
department stores. But after 1900 the use of electricity took off with such speed that by 1929
virtually all urban dwellings were connected to power. The 792-foot landmark Woolworth
skyscraper was completed in 1913, and most of Manhattan became vertical by 1929. The
transition to electrification of manufacturing was concentrated in the period 1915-29. 24
Similarly, there was a gestation period when inventors pondered how to combine the
power of an internal combustion engine with the previously flimsy structure of a horse-drawn
carriage and to develop the transmissions, brakes, and other essential components. As if in a
race, the horseless carriage bolted out of the starting gate from zero vehicles in 1900 to such an
extent that by 1929 the ratio of motor vehicles to the number of American households had
reached 89 percent. By that year 93 percent of Iowa farmers owned a motor vehicle.

24

Reasons for the long delay in the impact of electricity in manufacturing are provided in the classic and oft-cited
paper by David (2000).

At least three aspects of the Second Industrial Revolution have received less attention
than they deserve. First is the multi-dimensional nature of the revolution. Unlike the onedimension ICT revolution of the past 40 years, the creations of IR #2 spanned multiple
dimensions – electricity and its spinoffs; running water and sewers; motor vehicles and their
complementary inventions such as highways, personal travel, and supermarkets; entertainment
from the phonograph to the radio, TV, and motion pictures; public health and reduced
mortality; and a revolution in working conditions that eliminated child labor and utterly
changed life on the job from brutal and short to less physically demanding and more
comfortable work.
The second surprising aspect is that everything happened all at once. When all these
transformations are layered on top of each other, they hardly existed in 1880 yet were nearly
complete in urban America by 1929. The third surprising aspect is that economic progress
through 1972 mainly consisted of consolidating the incomplete aspects of IR #2 across many
subsidiary and complementary inventions, including the spread of consumer appliances
through the 1950s, the invention of television to supplement the radio and motion picture, the
spread of air conditioning from commercial to residential ubiquity, the interstate highway
system during 1958-72 as a complement to the motor car, and finally the development of
commercial air transport from its primitive and tiny footprint in 1940 to its creation of rapid
business and personal travel with the spread of jet planes which was accomplished by 1972.
Two criteria help to capture the uniqueness of IR#2. First, something cannot be more
than 100 percent of itself. The years 1890-1930 in urban America witnessed almost 100 percent
of urban housing units connected to electricity, gas, telephone, water and sewer connections.
The diffusion of electric household appliances into the American household had reached nearly
100 percent by 1970. The percentage ratio of motor vehicles to the number of households had
reached 90 percent by 1929. Productivity was enhanced by the transition from farm to city,
which was largely complete by the early postwar years, and the percentage of urban vs. rural
cannot exceed 100 percent.
The second criteria is that some indicators cannot go below zero. Most important was
the decline in the variance of indoor temperature between winter and summer, from a large
number to nearly zero as central heating and air condition became pervasive. Infant mortality
during 1900-1950 fell from 20 percent almost to zero. Fatality rates among employees in the
railroad, mining, and manufacturing industries fell rapidly and death rates from auto accidents
declined by a factor of at least 15 in the 20th century..

6. Anticipating the Next 40 Years of Innovation
As indicated above, there is no need to predict any faltering or slowdown in the rate of
innovation over the next 40 years. My baseline productivity growth forecast (for the total
economy) of 1.30 percent per year starts from the realized growth rate over 1972-2012 of 1.59
percent and subtracts Jorgenson’s 0.27 percent for the likely effect of the slower advance of
educational attainment.

24

6.1 What Was Invented in the Past 40 Years?
The benefits of IR #2 petered out in the early 1970s and were replaced by the onedimensional fruits of IR #3. Yet from our current perspective as we peer out into the future, the
achievements of the past 40 years set a hurdle that is dauntingly high. The achievements that
must be matched for importance in the next four decades include
•
•
•
•
•
•

•

Memory typewriters, the personal computer, word-processing and spreadsheets
Bar-code scanning, ATM banking, cable and satellite TV
Internet, e-mail, web browsing, e-commerce
Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, Linked-In, Facebook
Mobile phones, smart phones, ipads
CDs, DVDs, i-tunes, Netflix, movie streaming
Airline reservation systems, supply-chain monitoring systems, electronic library catalogs
Throughout every sector, paper, typewriters and mechanical calculators have been
replaced by flat screens running powerful software.

What is in store for the next 40 years? The usual stance of economic historians like Joel
Mokyr is that the human brain is incapable of forecasting future innovations. He states without
qualification that “History is always a bad guide to the future and economic historians should
avoid making predictions.” 25 He assumes that an instrument is necessary for an outcome. As
an example, it would have been impossible for Pasteur to discover his germ theory of disease if
Joseph A. Lister had not invented the achromatic-lens microscope in the 1820s. Mokyr’s
optimism about future technological progress rests partly on the dazzling array of new tools
that have arrived recently to create further research advances – “DNA sequencing machines
and cell analysis,” “high-powered computers,” and “astronomy, nanochemistery, and genetic
engineering.” One of Mokyr’s central tools in facilitating scientific advance is “blindingly fast
search tools” so that all of human knowledge is instantly available.
Mokyr does not follow Erik Brynjolfsson and other techno-optimists down the trail of
small robots, big data, and driverless cars. His examples do not center on digitalization but
rather involve fighting infectious diseases, the need of technology to help reduce the
environmental pollution caused by excess fertilizer use, and the evocative query whether “can
new technology stop [global warming]?” He joins Brynjolfsson and others in worrying whether
the machines will displace human workers, but he rightly appeals to two centuries of
mechanical inventions that replaced workers by machines without causing mass
unemployment.
Mokyr finishes by citing Keynes’ 1931 essay “Economic Possibilities for Our
Grandchildren” without any mention that Keynes suggested that technological change would
“solve mankind’s economic problem” and (in a section that Mokyr does not quote) allow men
to reduce their work load to 15 hours per week. We are still waiting for the 15-hour week for

airplanes.
6.2 Aspects of the Future Can Be Predicted
My forecast of 1.3 percent annual total-economy productivity growth in the future does
not require any foresight beyond suggesting that the past 40 years are a more relevant
benchmark of feasible productivity growth than the 80 years of before 1972. Yet most of the
observers of the debate about future U. S. economic growth appear to believe that
“technological change is accelerating.” 26 A central problem in assessing the optimistic view is
that there is rarely any examination of the past. “Accelerating” relative to what? Will future
productivity growth accelerate beyond the dot.com boom period of 1996-2004, or are the
optimists suggesting that the slowdown experienced in 2004-2013 is temporary? Who knows,
because the techno-optimists do not provide time horizons or specific numbers, just a haze of
incantations about artificial intelligence and geometric growth of big data processing capacity.
A lynchpin for the optimists made explicit by Mokyr (2013) is that the future cannot be
forecast; any pessimist gazing into the future is condemned by a lack of imagination and
doomed to repeat the mistakes of past pessimists. But the common assumption that future
innovation is non-forecastable is wrong. There are many historical precedents of correct
predictions made 50 or 100 years in advance. After we review some of these, we will return to
today’s forecasts for the next two to four decades.
An early forecast of the future of technology is contained in Jules Verne’s 1863
manuscript Paris in the Twentieth Century, in which Verne made bold predictions about the Paris
a century later in 1960. 27 In that early year, before Edison or Benz, Verne had already conceived
of the basics of the 20th century. He predicted rapid transit cars running on overhead viaducts,
motor cars with gas combustion engines, and street lights connected by underground wires.
Much of IR#2 was not a surprise. Looking ahead in the year 1875, inventors were
feverishly working on turning the telegraph into the telephone, trying to find a way to
transform electricity coming from batteries into the power source to create electric light, trying
to find a way of harnessing the power of petroleum to create a lightweight and powerful
internal combustion engine. The 1875 diaries of Edison, Bell, and Benz are full of such “we’re
almost there” speculation. Once that was achieved, the dream since Icarus of human flight
became a matter of time and experimentation. 28

26

In June 2013 the Economist blog ran a debate using Oxford Union rules. A stark proposition “Technological
Change is Accelerating,” a set of initial statements, rebuttals, and closing statements, and then the vote. My
opponent Andrew McAfee of MIT won the vote by 71 percent to 29 percent.
27
Details about the Verne book and its predictions come from Vijg (2011, pp. 35-36).
28
Details of the invention of electricity, the internal combustion engine, wireless transmission, and many other late19th century innovations are contained in Smil (2005). A broader horizon of the history of invention is presented by
Mokyr (1990). The hour-by-hour drama of the discovery of the first working electric light bulb in October, 1879, is
provided by Stoss (2007).

26

Some of the most important sources of human progress over the 1870-1940 period were
not new inventions at all. Running water had been achieved by the Romans, but it took
political will and financial investment to bring it to every urban dwelling place. The first
industrial revolution made possible steam-powered water pumps to distribute water within
cities, and IR #2 soon replaced the steam pumps with more economical electricity-driven
pumps. A separate system of sewer pipes was not an invention, but implementing it over the
interval 1870-1930 required resources, dedication, and a commitment to using public funds for
infrastructure investment.
A source of technological forecasting appeared in November, 1900 in the most unlikely
publication medium, the Ladies Home Journal (Watkins, 1900). Some of the predictions were
laughably wrong and unimportant, such as strawberries the size of baseballs. But there were
enough accurate predictions in this page-long three-column article to suggest that much of the
future can be known. Some of the more interesting forecasts were:
•

•
•
•

•

•

“Hot and cold air will be turned on from spigots to regulate the temperature of the air
just as we now turn on hot and cold water from spigots to regulate the temperature of
the bath.”
“Ready-cooked meals will be purchased from establishments much like our bakeries of
today.”
“Liquid-air refrigerators will keep large quantities of food fresh for long intervals.”
“Photographs will be telegraphed from any distance. If there is a battle in China a
century hence, photographs of the events will be published in newspapers an hour
later.”
“Automobiles will be cheaper than horses are today. Farmers will own automobile haywagons, automobile truck-wagons . . . automobiles will have been substituted for every
horse-vehicle now known.
“Persons and things of all types will be brought within focus of cameras connected with
screens at opposite ends of circuits, thousands of miles at a span. . . the lips of a remote
actor or singer will be heard to offer words or music when seen to move.”

The Jules Verne 1863 and the Ladies Home Journal 1900 visions of future technological
progress were true leaps of imagination. Somewhat less challenging were predictions of the
future made at the 1939-40 New York Worlds’ Fair. By 1939-40, IR#2 was almost complete in
urban America, so it is no surprise that the exhibits at the Fair could predict quite accurately the
further complements to IR #2 inventions, such as superhighways and air conditioning.
What could have been predicted in 1939 about the post-1940 era? Surely the war and the
details of its aftermath were a surprise, but for domestic consumer goods the 1939-40 New York
World’s Fair provided an accurate preview of the 1950s and 1960s. A future of air-conditioned
homes and businesses was no intellectual stretch at the fair, as air conditioning in movie
theaters began in 1922 and was nearly ubiquitous in theaters by the late 1930s.
Television was introduced at the fair, and it was easy to predict then that television over
the next two decades would follow the American model of commercially-supported radio, with

27

entertainment provided over several large networks spanning the continent. Elaborate scale
models at the New York fair showed the future high-rise city straddling multi-lane
superhighways where travel on the inner lanes occurred at 100 miles per hour. Exhibits
previewed the typical kitchen and its appliances almost exactly as they came true in the 1950s
and 1960s. While commercial aviation was primitive in 1939, still it was easy to forecast from
the rapid progress in the size and speed of aircraft over the 1926-40 period that much larger
aircraft could fly much longer distances, and indeed it took only a few years before the DC-6
and DC-7 were spanning the continent and the globe prior to the epochal introduction of the
Boeing 707 jet in 1958.
What was missing at the 1939-40 Worlds’ Fair was any vision of the computer revolution
that created IR #3. But Norbert Wiener, a visionary, in a 1949 essay that was ultimately rejected
by the New York Times, got a lot of the future of IR #3 right. Among his 1949 predictions were
These new machines have a great capacity for upsetting the present basis of
industry, and of reducing the economic value of the routine factory employee to
a point at which he is not worth hiring at any price. . . . if we move in the
direction of making machines which learn and whose behavior is modified by
experience, we must face the fact that every degree of independence we give the
machine is a degree of possible defiance of our wishes. The genie in the bottle
will not willingly go back in the bottle, nor have we any reason to expect them to
be well-disposed to us. (Markoff, 2013).
Just as some future inventions have been a surprise, including the entire electronics and
digital revolutions, other anticipated inventions never came to pass. The Jetsons’ vertical
commuting car/plane never happened, and in fact high fuel costs caused many local helicopter
short-haul aviation companies to shut down. 29 Dick Tracy’s wrist radio in cartoon comic strips
of the late 1940s finally is coming to fruition 70 years later with Google’s miniaturized smart
phone for the wrist, but the marginal utility of a wrist device compared to the existing smart
phone sinks into the insignificance of small things. In the famous quip of Peter Theil, “we
wanted flying cars, and they gave us 140 characters.”

7. The Inventions That Are Now Forecastable
Our basic forecast of future productivity growth assumes that innovation over the next
four decades will proceed at the same rate as over the past four decades. A bit of skepticism is
warranted about the next four decades of innovation, because we have already experienced the
digital revolution for the past 40 years during which the most fruitful applications of electronics
have by now occurred.

29

When I arrived home in Berkeley from college or graduate school near Boston, I often traveled by the SFO
helicopter line which flew frequent schedules from the SFO airport to the Berkeley marina. This company abruptly
shut down in 1974 as a result of the first oil shock.

28

The Brynjolfsson-McAfee (2014) sales pitch for technological optimism is misleading. In
contrast to the account provided above which gives primacy to IR#2, Brynjolfsson and McAfee
skip over IR#2 completely, as if they have hit the “delete” button. For them, there is a giant leap
from the steam engine to the computer, with no electricity nor internal combustion engines in
between, must less all of the multiple dimensions of improvement that took place between 1870
and 1970. This is why they title their book The Second Machine Age rather than The Third
Machine Age, because they would prefer to forget that IR#2 was the big event in the history of
technological change. Their leap across IR#2 is evident from the beginning, when they write
“we’re finally refining computers just as steam engines were refined” (Brynjolfsson-McAfee, p.
9).
The optimists assert that “we’re at an inflection point” (Brynjolfsson-McAfee, 2014, p.
44), apparently between a past of slow technological change and a future of rapid change. They
appear to believe that Big Blue’s chess victory and Watson’s victory at the TV game show
Jeopardy presage an age in which robots outsmart humans in every aspect of human work effort.
They remind us Moore’s Law that predicts endless exponential growth of the performance
capability of computer chips, without recognizing that the translation from Moore’s Law to the
performance-price behavior of ICT equipment peaked in 1998 and has declined ever since. The
price of ICT equipment relative to its performance, instead of declining at 15 percent per year as
in 1998, has steadily retreated in the rate of decline until in 2012 it barely declined at all. (see
Figure 10 below).
Timing is a basic problem in the Brynjolfsson-McAfee scenario. For instance, they
provide an example, presumably to demonstrate accelerating technological change, that goes
like this: “These days, of course, instead of handing Erik a disk, Andy is more likely to attach
the file to an e-mail message.” This is not an example of technological progress in 2013 but in
1993. Most of us have been trading computer files as e-mail attachments for at least two
decades. The big question is, can the inventions that occur in 2014 and beyond match those that
have already occurred over the past few decades, including all of those reported by the two
authors as representing the future whereas by now they are part of the past. 30
7.1 Stasis in the American Office and Home
The digital revolution centered on 1970-2000 utterly changed the way offices function
everywhere. In 1970 the electronic calculator had just been invented but the computer terminal
was still in the future. Office work required innumerable clerks to operate the keyboards of
electric typewriters that had no ability to download content from the rest of the world. Memory
typewriters were just being introduced, so in 1970 there was still repetitive retyping. Starting
from this world of 1970, by the year 2000 every office was equipped with a web-linked personal
computer that could do not just word-processing without repetitive retyping, but also
download multiple types of content and also perform any type of calculation at blinding speed.
30

This technological transition can be precisely dated. In the last stages of writing my data-intensive book that was
completed in 1988, all of the computer output was delivered as huge printouts to the front porch of my home by a
graduate research assistants. By 1994 all computer output arrived via e-mail attachment, and the piles of paper had
disappeared forever.

29

By 2005 flat screens had completed the transition to the modern office. But then progress
stopped. Throughout the world, the equipment used in office work and the productivity of
office employees closely resembles that of a decade ago. 31
In contrast to office work, life at home has hardly changed since the 1950s, by which
time all the major household appliances (washer, dryer, refrigerator, range, dishwasher, and
garbage disposer) had been invented, and by 1972 they had reached most American
households. The only inventions since 1970 to alter life at home have been the microwave oven,
the diffusion of central air-conditioning (an invention of the 1920s) and the succession of
improvements in the quality and variety of audio and video equipment. Listening to sound
made the transition in the early 1950s from the 78 rpm record and record changer to 45 rpm
records for pop music singles and 33 rpm records for albums. Audio technology improved by
progressing from records to 8-track tapes to cassette tapes to CDs and then to digital music sold
by i-tunes and listened to on the i-pod. Similarly, television made its transition to color between
1965 and 1972, then variety increased with cable television, and finally picture quality was
improved with high-definition signals and receiving sets. Variety increased even further when
Blockbuster and then Netflix made it possible to rent an almost infinite variety of motion
picture DVDs. And throughout the 1990-2005 period, homes experienced the same access to
web information and entertainment, as well as to e-commerce, that happened a few years earlier
in the office.
This long and continuous process is similar both in duration and character to the
improvement of motor vehicles over the first five to six decades from 1900 to 1960, as the flimsy
open and low-powered cars of 1901 became the powerful, sleek, and accessory-laden cars of the
1950s. The sense that technical change is slowing down in consumer electronic goods was
palpable at the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show (CES):
But in some ways, this show was a far cry from the shows of old . . . over the
years it has been the place to spot some real innovations. In 1970, the
videocassette recorder was introduced at CES. In 1981 the compact disc player
had its debut there. High definition TV was unveiled in 1998, the Microsoft Xbox
in 2001. This year’s crop of products seemed a bit underwhelming by
comparison . The editor of . . . a gadget website [said] “this industry that
employs all of these engineers, and has all of these factories and salespeople,
needs you to throw out your old stuff and buy new stuff – even if that new stuff”
is only slightly upgraded (Bilton, 2014).

31

For instance, in most economics departments the revolution occurred back in the 1980s when professors began to
do their own research papers with PC word processors, and they reveled at the new opportunity to set their own
complex equations instead of having to monitor math-illiterate secretaries. Department staffs became smaller
because the need for repetitive retyping disappeared. Yet then progress stopped; the Northwestern economics
department staff in 2013 is the same size and carries out the same functions as that staff did in 2002.

30

7.2 Which Future Inventions Can be Forecast?
Just as the 1939 World’s Fair forecast numerous life-changing inventions and further
diffusion of existing inventions like air conditioning and television, so today’s future-looking
literature can credibly identify several directions of major advance. Yet when more closely
examined, the value to consumers of these hypothetical inventions seem of small scale
compared to those that could be foreseen at the 1939-40 New York World’s Fair, by the Ladies’
Home Journal in 1900, or by an acute observer at the dawn of IR #2 in 1875.
The future advances that are widely forecast can be divided into four main categories –
medical, small robots and 3-D printing, big data, and driverless vehicles. Enthusiasts of “big
data” sometimes label this category of advance as “artificial intelligence.” It is worth examining
the potential of each of these categories of future innovation in turn, and then we will ask
whether what Brynjolfsson and McAfee call the “inflection point” leads to faster growth as they
believe or to slower growth or, most plausibly, no change.
Medical and Pharmaceutical Advances. Future advances in medicine related to the
genome have already proved to be disappointing. The most important sources of higher life
expectancy in the 20th century were achieved in the first half of that century, when life
expectancy rose at twice the rate of the last half. This was the interval during which infant
mortality was conquered by the discovery of the germ theory of disease, the development of
anti-toxins for diphtheria, and the near-elimination of air-and water-distributed diseases
through the achievement of constructing urban sanitation infrastructure (Cutler and Miller,
2005).
Many of the current basic tools of modern medicine were developed between 1940 and
1980, including antibiotics, the polio vaccine, heart procedures, chemotherapy, and radiation.
The current status of science in medical treatment and pharmaceutical advance is well
described by Jan Vijg (2011, especially his Chapter 4). Progress on physical disease and
ailments is advancing faster than on mental disease, so that we can look forward in two or three
decades to an exponential rise in the burden of taking care of elderly Americans who are
physically alive but in a state of mental dementia. Pharmaceutical research has reached a brick
wall of rapidly increasing costs and declining benefits, with a decline in major drugs approved
each pair of years over the past decade, as documented by Vijg (2011). At enormous cost drugs
are being developed that will treat esoteric types of cancer at costs that no medical insurance
system can afford. Vijg is highly critical of the current regime of drug testing in the U.S. as
inhibiting risk taking, an example of the overregulation of the U.S. economy.
Small Robots, Artificial Intelligence, and 3-D Printing. Much attention has been paid
in the popular media to small robots since “Baxter,” the inexpensive $25,000 robot, made his
debut on the TV program 60 Minutes. The appeal of the Baxter example is that the cost is so
cheap. Baxter can perform the functions of a human, as long as it can stand in place and not be
expected to move. From a broader time-perspective, however, Baxter elicits a big yawn.
Industrial robots were introduced by General Motors in 1961. By the mid-1990s, robots were

31

welding auto parts and replacing workers in the lung-killing environment of the auto paint
shop. 32
Reflections on Baxter lead to skepticism that it/he is a major threat to American jobs
outside of routine tasks in manufacturing, which only makes up 8 percent of American
employment. For his demonstration at the TED conference in Long Beach in late February,
2013, Baxter had to be packed in a suitcase. He could not get his own boarding pass and walk
onto the plane. This is the problem with robots – they are both mentally and physically limited
to narrow tasks. They can think but can’t walk, or they can walk but can’t think. Their
homeland is in manufacturing plants and in wholesale distribution warehouses, where they
find the Amazon books and bring them to the packer, who so far remains a human because the
robots have not yet figured out how to arrange books in a package. Google is experimenting
with robots shaped like wild animals that can run at great speeds, but it remains to be seen if
any robot can be created that combines the multiple functions of the UPS driver at driving the
truck, finding the package, and knowing from memory just where to place it at the office,
condo, or residential home location.
This lack of multitasking ability is dismissed by the robot enthusiasts – just wait, it is
coming. Soon our robots will not only be able to win at Jeopardy but also will be able to check in
your bags at the sky cap station at the airport, thus displacing the skycaps. But the physical
tasks that humans can do are unlikely to be replaced in the next several decades by robots.
Surely multiple-function robots will be developed, but it will be a long and gradual process
before robots outside of the manufacturing and wholesaling sectors become a significant factor
in replacing human jobs in the service or construction sectors.
What is often forgetten is that we are well into the computer age, and every Home
Depot, Wal-Mart, and local supermarket has self-check-out lines that allow you to check out
your groceries or paint cans by scanning them through a robot. But except for very small orders
it takes longer, and so people still voluntarily wait in line for a human instead of taking the
option of the no-wait self-checkout-lane. The same theme – that the most obvious uses of robots
and computers have already happened – pervades commerce. Airport baggage sorting belts are
mechanized, as is most of the process of checking in for a flight.
For more than three decades payments have been made by plastic cards instead of by
cash or checks as in our parents’ and grandparents’ era, but that revolution is over and the
marginal utility of paying by swiping a cell phone is at the outer limit of small gains. In the
early years of credit cards in the 1970s and 1980s, check-out clerks had to make voice phone
calls for authorization, then there was a transition to little terminals that would dial the
authorization phone number, and now the authorization arrives within a few seconds. That is
part of the many accomplishments of IR #3 that will be difficult to surpass in the next 40 years.
3-D printing is another revolution described by the techno-optimists, but its potential
impact is limited. Recent reports suggest that 3-D printing is a small deal best suited for one-off
32

These comments on mid-1990s automobile factory technology come from my membership of the NBER “pin
factory group” that organized plant tours for NBER-affiliated research staff at that time.

32

customized operations, such as the ability to create a crown in a dentist office instead of having
to send out a mold. 3-D printing represents custom production rather than mass production,
and thus retreats from the economies of scale and efficiency of Henry Ford’s 1913 assembly line.
Doubtless it will raise productivity in design labs that create models of new products but has
less potential to raise economy-wide productivity growth.
Big Data. The enthusiasts for future technical progress are fascinated by exponents, as
in “exponential growth leads to staggeringly big numbers” (Brynjolffson and McAfee, 2014, p.
47). Using Moore’s Law, they forecast big data extending beyond trillions and quadrillions and
quintillions to far beyond into orders of magnitude that are only now being named. But realworld growth has never happened at hundreds and thousands of percent per year. All growth
rates are exponential; there is nothing uniquely exponential about the growth of big data. A 2.0
percent growth rate in per-capita income of the U.S. over 1891-2007 represents an exponential
increase of EXP(116*2/100) = 10.2. What is more exponential than that? One thing is clear – as
the cost of data bytes reaches zero, so the ratio of GDP to data bytes reaches zero as well. There
is no longer any connection between Moore’s Law or the growth of data with the growth rates
of two of the most most important ratios of the economy: output per capita and output per
hour.
What is lost by the enthusiasts for big data is that most of it is a zero-sum game. The
vast majority of big data is being analyzed within large corporations for marketing purposes.
The Economist reported recently that corporate IT expenditures for marketing purposes were
increasing at three times the rate of other corporate IT expenditures. The marketing wizards
use big data to figure out what their customers buy, why they change their purchases from one
category to another, and why they move from merchant to merchant.
With enough big data, Corporation A may be able to devise a strategy to steal market
share from Corporation B, but B will surely fight back with an onslaught of more big data. An
excellent and current example involves the large legacy airlines with their data-rich frequent
flyer programs. The analysts at these airlines are constantly trolling through their big data to
try to understand why they have lost market share in a particular city or with a particular
demographic group of travelers.
Every airline has a “revenue management” department that decides how many seats on
a given flight on a given day should be sold at cheap, intermediate, and expensive prices. Vast
amounts of data are analyzed, and computers examine historical records, monitor day-by-day
booking patterns, factor in holidays and weekends, and come out with an allocation. But at a
medium-sized airline JetBlue, 25 employees are required to monitor computers, and the
humans must constantly override the decisions of the computers. The director of revenue
management at JetBlue describes his biggest surprise in taking over his job as “how often the
staff has to override the computers.” 33

The quantity of electronic data has been rising exponentially for decades. But
diminishing returns have set in. The sharp slowdown in productivity growth in recent years
has overlapped with the introduction of smart phones and ipads, which consume huge
amounts of data. These sources of innovation have disappointed in what counts, their ability to
boost output per hour in the American economy. Indeed U. S. productivity growth has been
growing at less than one percent per year during the heyday of the roll-out of smart phones and
tablets. 34
Driverless Cars. This category of future progress is demoted to last place because it
offers benefits that are so minor compared to the invention of the car itself, or the improvements
in safety that have created a ten-fold improvement in fatalities per vehicle mile since 1950. The
most important distinction is between cars and trucks. People are in cars to go from A to B,
much of it for essential aspects of life such as commuting or shopping. Thus the people must be
inside the driverless car to achieve their objective of getting from point A to point B. What is
the revolutionary achievement of consumer surplus by being able to commute without driving?
Instead of listening to the current panoply of options, including Bluetooth phone calls, internetprovided music, or home-provided i-tunes music, you can actually look at a computer screen
and do your e-mail. This is not a potential revolution even on a par with the invention of the
iphone, much less the web or e-commerce, much less the invention of the automobile itself.
That leaves the potential future productivity advantage offered by driverless trucks.
This is a potentially productivity-enhancing innovation, albeit within the tiny slice of U.S.
employment consisting of truck drivers. However, driving from place to place is only half of
what truck drivers do. UPS drivers jump off truck, find the package inside the truck, and
deliver the package to businesses and residences, knowing whether to place the packages on the
front porch or a back-porch hiding place.
Wholesale trucks arrive at supermarkets and stop at the back loading dock. The drivers
are responsible for loading the cases of Coca-Cola or the stacks of bread loaves onto dollies and
placing them manually on the shelves. In fact, it is remarkable in this late phase of the
computer revolution that almost all placement of individual product cans, bottles, and tubes on
retail shelves is achieved today by humans rather than robots.
7.3 Is the Inflection Point One of Speeding Up or Slowing Down?
Brynjolfsson and McAfee do not define the exact dating of their transition. They often
write as if everything digital that has already occurred over the past two decades should be
included in the benefits of future invention. Instead, this paper takes the chronology more
literally. What has already been invented, including the iphone and ipad, is part of the past
history of IR #3, and the question is what will be invented in the future to match or surpass the
achievements of the digital age since 1972?

34

Total economy output per hour grew at an annual rate of 0.75 percent per year between 2010:Q1 and 2013:Q3.

This section reminds the techno-optimists that there is a strong case that technological
change is slowing down, not speeding up. Previous sections of this paper have already shown
that productivity growth was 0.77 percentage points slower in the 41 years since 1972 as in the
81 years prior to 1972.
We have seen in Figure 2 and 5 that there was a temporary revival of productivity
growth between 1996 and 2004. But productivity growth was much slower in 1972-96 and in
2004-13, i.e., in 33 of the past 41 years. The techno-optimists ignore the temporary character of
the late 1990s dot.com productivity revival. In this section we examine three new pieces of
evidence that the third industrial revolution (IR #3) was uniquely concentrated in those eight
years 1996-2004 and contributed remarkably little to productivity growth before or since.
The Federal Reserve reports monthly its Index of Industrial Production and Industrial
Capacity. It also reports the ratio of the two, the rate of capacity utilization. Shown in Figure 8
is the annual growth rate of manufacturing capacity, both by itself and expressed as a ratio to
the working-age population. The uniqueness of the 1996-2004 interval is clearly evident in the
graph. The growth of manufacturing capacity proceeded at an annual rate between two and
three percent from 1972 to 1994, then surged to seven percent in the late 1990s, and then came
back down, declining to a negative growth rate in 2011-2012. The lower line showing growth in
per-capita manufacturing capacity has been in negative territory since 2007.

35

The implications of a decline in manufacturing capacity per capita evokes memories of
the hysteresis hypothesis developed in the 1980s in the context of soaring unemployment in
Europe. Calculations for Western Europe showed that by 1990 there was insufficient industrial
capacity to employ the labor force at the low unemployment rates experienced in Europe before
1975. Figure 8 immediately raises a corollary question – why was capacity growth in the late
1990s so disproportionately higher than in the years before or since?
Much of the answer comes from a little known data series displayed in Figure 9,
displaying the ratio of value-added in ICT-producing industries to value-added in total U.S.
manufacturing. The ratio in 2013 was three percent, just the same as in 1972. In between, the
same ratio rose to an initial plateau between 1983 and 1994 before soaring to a peak of 8.5
percent in late 2000. Then it plunged in 2002-04, followed by a steady erosion back down to
three percent. While we are all familiar with the fact that most ICT manufacturing is
performed in Asia, nevertheless the startling disappearance of ICT production from the
American domestic economy is a surprise and does not bode well for future productivity
growth in the manufacturing sector.

36

The third piece of evidence that the late 1990s were unique is more familiar and has been
discussed before. That interval witnessed the most rapid rate of decline in performanceadjusted prices of ICT equipment in the history of the digital IR #3. The rate of decline of the
ICT equipment deflator peaked at minus 15 percent in 1998, but its rate of decline has steadily
diminished to barely minus one percent in 2012.

8. Conclusion
This paper contrasts a realized 2.0 percent growth rate per year in real per-capita GDP
over 1891-2007 to a future post-2007 growth rate of 1.3 percent per year for productivity, 0.9 for
average output per capita, 0.4 for the pre-tax pre-transfer income received by the bottom 99% of
the income distribution, and 0.2 for the disposable income of the bottom 99%. Our discussion of
the headwinds calls attention to the interactions among demography, education, and inequality.
Workers with low levels of education are dropping out of the labor force as a result of
globalization that has moved economic activity to foreign countries or from unionized northern
states to nonunion southern states. These labor-force drop-outs help to explain why hours per
capita have declined so rapidly in the past 16 years, more rapidly than can be explained by the
retirement of the baby-boomers.
The socioeconomic decay of the bottom one-third of the white population, as
documented by Charles Murray, paints a picture of declining percentages of marriage and
increasing percentages of divorce and “never married” status. This interacts with the future

37

outcome of educational attainment, because the rapid decline in the percentage of children
living with both biological parents predicts future high-school dropping out, a stagnation of
high-school graduation rates and college completion rates. Separately, the growth of college
student debt to more than $1 trillion leads to a prediction of delays in marriage and child birth,
and a decline in the rate of population growth which aggravates the other sources of the future
growth slowdown.
The forecast of slower U.S. growth relies for about 2/3 of its prediction on the impact of
the six headwinds, of which four are quantified here in terms of their impact on future growth.
What about innovation? This paper recognizes that it is not necessary to forecast that future
innovation will be any less important than the record of innovations already achieved in the
four decades since 1972.
Instead, the sense in which innovation has been “faltering” is not a prediction about the
future compared to the recent past, but rather is a comment from the raw data about American
economic growth in the 80 years before 1972 as contrasted to less rapid growth in the four
decades after 1972. That slowdown is the best available evidence that the third industrial
revolution (IR #3, mainly digital, post-1972) was a mere shadow of the second industrial
revolution (IR #2, multi-dimensional, 1875-1972).
While there is no need to forecast that future innovations will be less important than the
past, some skepticism is offered here. When young audiences are confronted with the question
“Is Technological Change Accelerating?” they vote en masse “yes.” They appear to treat the
iphone and ipad as a major technical advance, forgetting that their hand-held devices rest on
the shoulders of previous advances including personal computers, laptops, cell phone
technology, not to mention the air conditioning which makes their homes and offices
comfortable year-round, all of which rests in turn on the electricity upon which they rely to
recharge their devices every night.
Techno-optimists remind us that much of the innovation that originates in the U.S.
travels around the world with blazing speed through purchases of smart phones and the
software that has been developed for them. But other countries can have the free lunch of
enjoying American innovation including thousands of smart-phone apps without being saddled
with American socio-economic decay, poor educational test scores, massive student debt, high
school drop-outs, rising poverty together with explosive growth of incomes at the very top, and
the need to reform entitlement programs that are in trouble in part because the U.S. has refused
to make medical care a right of citizenship. Today we can only guess which nations will replace
the U.S. and remove it from its potential position of leadership due both to the size of its
population and its world-leadng real GDP per capita.
After years of debate about this topic, the most interesting questions remain to be
discussed. Clearly Canada, the Nordic nations, and Switzerland suffer less from the headwinds
than does the U.S. They are less subject to the interlocking quagmire of poverty, low school
achievement, high college costs, an expensive and inefficient medical system, and lack of child
care than the U.S.

38

How many other nations suffer less from the headwinds? Does it matter to the rest of
the world whether U. S. innovation falters or not? The great American inventions of the last
two decades have spread across the globe with impressive speed. My final and perhaps most
radical thought is that innovation is a free good for the world as a whole, while headwinds are
uniquely nation-specific. This leads to the suggestion that over the next 50 years the slowing
growth of the American standard of living will result in a passing lane in which one country
after another exceeds real GDP per capita of the United States, by being able to buy American
innovation while facing headwinds that for many countries are mild breezes compared to the
gale force headwinds experienced by the United States. Today we can only guess whether the
passing lane includes one or more nations from Europe, East Asia, or our neighbor to the north.
