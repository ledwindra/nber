ABSTRACT
This paper investigates the impact of federal extramural research funding on total expenditures for
life sciences research and development (R&D) at U.S. universities, to determine whether federal R&D
funding spurs funding from non-federal (private and state/local government) sources. We use a fixed
effects instrumental variable approach to estimate the causal effect of federal funding on non-federal
funding. Our results indicate that a dollar increase in federal funding leads to a $0.33 increase in non-federal
funding at U.S. universities. Our evidence also suggests that successful applications for federal funding
may be interpreted by non-federal funders as a signal of recipient quality: for example, non-PhD-granting
universities, lower ranked universities and those that have historically received less funding experience
greater increases in non-federal funding per federal dollar received.

Introduction
Federal agencies spend billions of taxpayer dollars funding academic research each year.

Funding for academic research, especially in the life sciences, has risen rapidly over the last
decade. In 2007, total federal obligations for research and development (R&D) at academic
institutions totaled over $25 billion, of which $15.5 billion was provided by the National
Institutes of Health (NIH), primarily to support basic and applied research in the biomedical
sciences.1 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) provided an
additional $8.2 billion to NIH to fund extramural life sciences R&D. The oft-cited justification
for this level of public expenditure is that publicly-funded biomedical research results in better
medical treatments and even preemption of disease (National Institutes of Health, 2008). Under
ARRA, increases in federal funding for biomedical research are further justified as a means to
speed economic recovery, by increasing overall spending and employment opportunities.
However, despite these laudable aims, economic theory suggests that federal funding for R&D
could “crowd out” investment by fully-informed non-federal funders, thereby reducing its
effectiveness.
Increased federal investment could also cause individual investigators at universities to
substitute among funding sources. Because applying for funding is a costly activity, and because
increases in income may reduce the perceived utility of additional funds, an increase in
universities' federal funding might make them less inclined to pursue other funding sources. For
either or both of these reasons, a dollar increase in federal funding could yield less than a dollar
increase in total R&D.
On the other hand, private and public funding could be complements instead of
substitutes. For example, by subsidizing investment in capital or equipment, or by supporting

skill development, federal funding might increase the productivity of a university, making it
more competitive in the market for non-federal research funding. If funding sources are
complementary, a dollar increase in federal funding would increase total R&D by more than a
dollar.
Even if federal funding does not directly improve productivity, it may serve as a signal of
university quality. For example, due to the extensive peer review conducted by the NIH and
other federal agencies, non-federal funders seeking university partners may view successful
applications for federal funding as a signal of university quality. One might therefore expect a
stronger signaling effect at universities with less established research reputations, about which
potential non-federal investors have less information. In this case, a dollar increase in federal
funding should again yield more than a dollar increase in total funding for R&D, but with larger
effects at universities with smaller research portfolios and less established reputations.
Finally, it is possible that federal dollars may be the sole source of financial support for
some types of R&D, and thus neither substitute for nor complement private R&D funding. For
example, some have argued basic science is a public good, and would therefore be underfunded
by private sources. If this were the only effect operating, in the short run one would expect
changes in federal funding to have no impact on non-federal funding: that is, a dollar increase in
federal funding would simply increase total R&D funding by one dollar.
In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of federal funding on non-federal funding for
life sciences R&D at U.S. universities and colleges. Our empirical models account for potential
bias due to university characteristics that could be associated with both higher federal and higher
non-federal funding, such as the number and quality of faculty, supportiveness of the university
research environment, and the institution's reputation.

This question of whether federal funding substitutes for or complements other funding
has been previously studied in the literature. For example, David et al. (2000) reviewed literature
on government-issued contracts to the private sector and policies such as R&D tax credits, and
found mixed results: some studies suggested public R&D complements private R&D, while
others found that public R&D crowds out private R&D. Our research differs from the studies
reviewed by David et al. (2000) in that we focus on university recipients, and the extent to which
public (federal) R&D funding impacts R&D funding received from all non-federal sources.
However, despite these differences, the warnings in David et al. (2000) about latent omitted
variables and selection bias are relevant to our work. Diamond (1999) used aggregate, annual
time series data from 1953-1995 to study the connection between federal and private spending on
basic research in science, and found that a dollar increase in federal spending was associated
with an additional $0.08 in academic spending. Like David et al. (2000), Diamond (1999)
cautions the reader about omitted latent variables, but he does not apply any econometric
correction.
Some more recent studies have used instrumental variables and regression discontinuity
designs to address the omitted variables issue. For example, Payne (2001) and Payne and Siow
(2003) use instrumental variables to investigate the possible causal relationships between federal
funding and (a) philanthropic funding, and (b) research outcomes, including patents and
publications. Payne (2001) finds, when restricting observations to years post-1980, that a dollar
increase in federal research funding increases private donations by $0.64 to $0.68, with no
significant difference between private and public universities. Payne and Siow (2003) find that a
$1 million (1996 dollars) increase in federal funding to a university yields 10 more publications
and 0.2 patents. In contrast, using a regression discontinuity design, Jacob and Lefgren (2007)

find only modest increases in publication productivity for recipients of NIH R01 research project
grants, which they suggest may be due to substitution: on the margin, loss of an NIH grant
simply causes researchers to shift to another source of funding.
Our work complements prior research by exploring a mechanism through which federal
biomedical research funding might influence eventual commercialization (i.e., by attracting
complementary funding from private sources), and extends Payne (2001) to consider other nonfederal funding sources besides philanthropic donations. In addition, we construct a new
instrument that allows us to infer causality despite the presence of unobserved variables that may
impact both federal and non-federal funding at a given university over time. Finally, our paper
contributes to the existing literature by examining the particular case of federal life sciences
funding (mainly originating from the NIH), highlighting heterogeneous effects across
universities with differing characteristics, and extending earlier work with more current data
from a variety of sources.
To address potential omitted variable bias, we estimate an instrumental variable (IV)
model with university fixed effects, using predicted NIH funding as an instrument for federal life
sciences funding. To generate this instrumental variable, we first calculate the share of each
university's R&D funding awarded by each NIH Institute or Center (NIC) in the base year of our
analysis.

Because each of the NICs specializes in particular diseases, areas of human

development, or aspects of research support (see Smith (2006)), each university's distribution of
base-year funding across NICs reflects its particular research specialization. We then predict the
total NIH funding each university receives in subsequent years based on year-to-year changes in
the budgets of the individual NICs, assuming that the university's relative specialization, i.e., the
share of funding it receives from each NIC, remains constant throughout the study period. We

use this predicted NIH funding variable as an instrument for actual funding in our empirical
analysis.
The challenge in implementing the IV estimator is to find an instrument that is strongly
correlated with changes in federal research funding at universities, but is uncorrelated with other
types of shocks that might affect non-federal funding. Because year-to-year appropriations for
the different NICs are determined via political processes, the predicted funding levels described
above are unlikely to be related to changes in other factors that drive a particular university's
research capabilities and, therefore, its likelihood of receiving non-federal funding. We present
results from several tests of this assumption. For example, we find no correlation between yearto-year variation in NIC budgets and contemporaneous variation in related industry R&D. We
also find no relationship between the share of funding universities received from each NIC and
other observable characteristics associated with higher non-federal R&D. The results we report
here are also robust to changes in calculation of predicted NIH funding, such as using an earlier
base-year to calculate NIC shares. Predicted NIH funding is therefore a useful instrument for the
total federal life sciences R&D funding a university receives, and allows us to attribute causality
to federal life sciences and NIH funding.
We find that an additional dollar of federal funding for life sciences research increases
non-federal R&D funding by $0.33. The point elasticity (at the average) for non-federal funding
to lagged federal funding is 0.51. Our results also indicate that non-PhD-granting universities
and those that have historically received less funding from all sources may experience greater
increases in non-federal funding for each federal dollar. This suggests successful applications
for federal funding may be interpreted by non-federal funders as a signal of university quality.

Data and Identification Strategy

2.1

Data Sources
Data for this paper are derived from two sources: the National Science Foundation (NSF)

Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges, and
administrative records maintained by the Office of Extramural Research at NIH.
The NSF Survey population includes institutions granting bachelors or higher degrees in
science and engineering (S&E) fields, and spending at least $150,000 annually in S&E research
and development (R&D). Surveyed institutions report their S&E R&D expenditures by funding
source and field. For example, these data include the amount of life sciences R&D funding
received from federal versus non-federal (industry, state and local government, institutional, or
other) sources. For this analysis, we extracted universities' total and federally-funded R&D
expenditures by year and field for 1998 through 2006. Our dependent variable, non-federal life
sciences R&D funding, was calculated by subtracting federally-funded life sciences R&D
expenditures from total life sciences R&D expenditures.

Our key explanatory variable is

federally-funded life sciences R&D expenditures, lagged by one year, and is also derived from
this survey.

Life sciences R&D includes research in agricultural, biological, and medical

sciences, as well as allied health professions; however, since 1998 over half of academic R&D
expenditures in the life sciences have been for medical research, and this share has continued to
grow over time. Finally, for some models we include covariates for universities' federally- and
non-federally funded R&D in fields other than life sciences. To generate these covariates, we
subtract life sciences R&D from total R&D expenditures to calculate non-life-sciences R&D
expenditures for each institution-year.

Our dataset also includes other institutional

characteristics, such as whether the institution is public or private, and whether it grants PhDs in
S&E fields. These additional characteristics allow us to explore possible signaling effects.
NIH administrative data for each grant and contract awarded in fiscal years 1997 through
2006 include the grant or contract unique ID number, the fiscal year of the award, principal
investigator's institution (including institution name, city, and state), and the financial amount of
the award.2

As discussed in section 2.2, we use NIH award data from 1997 to calculate

universities' base-year funding shares by NIC.

We also use subsequent years' data in a

regression predicting non-federal funding as a function of actual NIH awards. This measure
differs from our key explanatory variable in that, while NIH is the lead federal agency funding
academic life sciences research, universities may also receive life sciences R&D funding from
other federal agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) or Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). In addition, although most NIH extramural R&D funding supports basic
and applied life sciences research, NIH also funds research in other fields. Thus, though actual
NIH funding is strongly correlated with universities' total life sciences R&D expenditures, for
consistency we rely on the NSF Survey data for our dependent and key explanatory variables.
We matched institutions across these two datasets in an iterative process. First, we found
all exact matches by institution name and state. Then, we extracted all remaining awardees in
the NIH data that were coded as institutions of higher education, and matched these institutions
by hand with those listed in the NSF survey. Finally, we included in our analytic dataset only
those institutions for which NSF survey data were available for each year in our study period,
1998-2006, and for which NIH awards were observed in the administrative data in 1997, which
limited our dataset to 272 institutions.

Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for our analytic dataset. Approximately one-third
of the 272 institutions in our panel are private, and over three-quarters grant PhDs in S&E fields.
On average, about 60% of university R&D expenditures were funded by the federal government
(62% for life sciences, and 60% for other fields).
Figure 1 shows the differences in growth for federal and non-federal life sciences R&D
funding for our panel. From 1998 through 2001, university life sciences R&D funding from both
sources grew at about the same rate, but in subsequent years, federal funding outpaced nonfederal funding. In 2006, the universities in our panel spent over $25 billion on life sciences
R&D, representing approximately 87% of the national total.3

Empirical Methods
We employ several empirical strategies to estimate the relationship between federal and

non-federal R&D funding at universities.

For all analyses, the unit of observation is the

university-year, and standard errors are clustered at the university level to accommodate serial
correlation. We first conduct descriptive analyses to examine the association between federal
and non-federal funding for life sciences at research universities.

Then, we estimate four

different sets of multivariate linear regression models to investigate the possibility of a causal
relationship between federal and non-federal R&D funding. Each set of multivariate regression
models incrementally controls for observed and unobserved university characteristics that could
bias our estimates of the causal relationship between federal and non-federal funding.
Our first regression estimates the simplest model:
NonFederal u ,t = α 0 + α 1 Federal u ,t −1 + τ + ε u ,t

(1)

where Federalu,t-1 is the real, lagged federal funding for life sciences R&D at university u in year
t - 1; NonFederalu,t is the real non-federal funding for life sciences at university u in year t, τ is a
vector of year fixed effects that non-parametrically controls for secular changes in non-federal
funding over time (e.g., due to changes in economic conditions); α0 is a constant; and εu,t is the
error term. The key coefficient of interest is α1, which estimates the change in non-federal
funding associated with a dollar increase in federal funding the previous year. We have two
reasons for using lagged federal funding as our key independent variable. First, as discussed in
Section 1, we anticipate that any true crowd-in (or crowd-out) effect should be due to
information about changes in federal funding that non-federal funders observe. Because nonfederal funders cannot observe concurrent public funding decisions, we lag all federal funding by
one year. Second, lagging federal funding insulates us, to a certain extent, from exogenous

shocks that might increase both federal and non-federal funding (e.g., increased interest in
funding for a particular disease in which the university has specialized, university hiring of new
senior faculty, etc.) in a given year.
However, as discussed in Section 1, α1 may nonetheless suffer from omitted variables
bias. For example, universities with more faculty members or stronger research reputations may
attract both greater federal and greater non-federal funding. These omitted variables would yield
a positive association between federal and non-federal funding, even if no causal relationship
exists. Thus our estimate of α1 is likely to be biased upward due to this spurious correlation,
because the model does not control for university characteristics. Our second regression model
addresses this source of bias. We estimate:
NonFederal u ,t = β 0 + β1 Federal u ,t −1 + τ + μ + ε u ,t

(2)

where μ is a vector of university fixed effects that control for all time-invariant differences across
universities. In contrast to equation (1) which exploited variation in funding levels both across
and within universities, this model exploits only the variation within individual universities' prior
year federal funding to estimate the effect on non-federal funding. In effect, this model estimates
whether a university that received more federal funding (relative to its average over the study
period) in year t received increased (or decreased) non-federal funding in year t+1. In this
specification, β1 could be biased if time-varying university characteristics are correlated with
growth (or decline) in federal and non-federal funding. For example, as discussed by Lawler
(2003), growth in non-federal (i.e., industry) funding at top research universities such as the
University of California at Berkeley and MIT may reflect strategic initiatives by university
administration to diversify funding sources. If increased federal fundraising activity occurred at

the same time, we might erroneously conclude that federal funding caused growth in non-federal
funding.
Our third regression model is designed to control for additional bias arising from such
time-varying university characteristics, by including the amounts of federal and non-federal
funding the university received for other S&E fields:
NonFederal u ,t = γ 0 + γ 1 Federal u ,t −1 + τ + μ + γ 2 OtherFed u ,t −1 + γ 3 OtherNonFe d u ,t + ε u ,t

(3)

In this model, we include lagged federal funding for other fields because overall university
reputation (not just within biomedical sciences) as captured by total federal funding may
influence non-federal funding decisions, particularly for complementary research. Inclusion of
same-year non-federal funding for other fields allows us to control for year-to-year differences in
the extent to which universities seek non-federal funding. Because university policy with respect
to non-federal funding is likely to be correlated with university quality, excluding these effects
could likewise yield biased estimates of γ1.
Finally, we use instrumental variables (IV) estimation to account for other observed and
unobserved time-varying university characteristics that might bias our coefficients.

Our

instrument for federal life sciences R&D funding is predicted NIH funding. Predicted NIH
funding is calculated based on the share of a given university's funding received from each NIC
in our base year, and the overall growth (or decline) in each NIC's budget each year.
Specifically, predicted NIH funding is given by:

⎛ Budget i ,t
NIH u ,t = NIH u ,b ∑ ⎜⎜
i ⎝ Budget i ,b

⎞
⎟ * sharei ,u ,b
⎟
⎠

(4)

where NIHu,b is the actual NIH funding for university u in our base year, 1997; Budgeti,t is the total
annual budget for NIH institute i in year t; and sharei,u,b is the share of total funding from NIC i for
university u in base year b. Equation (4) shows that growth in a given university's predicted NIH

funding is equal to the weighted average growth across NIC budgets, where weights reflect the
university's share of funding from each NIC in the base year. We then estimate the following IV
model using two-stage least squares:
Federal u ,t = θ 0 + θ1 NIH u ,t + θ 2 OtherFeder al u ,t + θ 3OtherNonFe deral u ,t + τ + μ + ς u ,t

(5)

NonFederal u ,t = δ 0 + δ1 Federalu ,t −1 + δ 2OtherFeder alu ,t −1 + δ 3OtherNonFe deralu ,t + τ + μ + ε u .t (6)

Our decision to analyze the effects of absolute rather than percent changes (i.e., the
decision not to log-transform the dependent and independent financial amounts) was based on
three observations. First, the large number of institution-years with no federal and/or non-federal
R&D funding for S&E fields would require us to drop nearly a hundred universities from our
panel (decreasing the number from 272 to 179). Ad-hoc methods to deal with this problem, such
as replacing all zero values with $1 or $1000, yield results which strongly depend on the choice
of replacement value. Second, exclusion of institutions with historically low levels of funding
from either source is counterproductive because we are particularly interested in evaluating the
possibility that successful applications for federal funding provide a signal of quality to nonfederal funders. The 179 institutions that do receive funding in all years are overwhelmingly
PhD-granting (93% vs. 78% in the full panel), and are somewhat more often public than private
(72% vs. 68% in the full panel). As one would expect, they also have higher average federal and
non-federal funding for both life- and non-life sciences, thus are unlikely to permit an
examination of signaling effects. Finally, to the extent that variance in the errors increases with
funding levels, heteroskedasticity in the linear model can be accommodated simply by our
calculation of robust standard errors.4,5

Results

3.1

Full Sample Effects

Table 2 shows the results from our multivariate regressions. The dependent variable in
each case is non-federal life sciences R&D funding, and the key independent variable is federal
life sciences R&D funding. The results from model 1 (corresponding to equation (1)) show that
a dollar increase in federal life sciences funding is associated with a $0.47 increase (p<.001) in
non-federal life sciences funding. However, as discussed above, the lack of any controls for
university characteristics in this model likely bias this estimate upwards.

For example,

universities with larger faculties and/or reputations for higher quality research might receive both
more federal and more non-federal funding for life sciences R&D. To address this concern,
subsequent models include university fixed effects to control for time invariant university
characteristics. Results from model 2 (corresponding to equation (2)) show that after controlling
for time invariant university characteristics and secular time trends, a dollar increase in federal
funding for life sciences R&D is associated with a $0.31 increase (p<.001) in non-federal
funding for life sciences R&D. Model 3 (corresponding to equation (3)) adds covariates for
federal and non-federal R&D funding in other fields, to control for unobserved time-varying
university characteristics. For example, as discussed in section 1, during our sample period a
given university's administration might have pushed for diversification in the university's funding
portfolio, or a smaller university might have transitioned from a more teaching-focused to a more
research-focused institution. Results from this model indicate that a dollar increase in federal
funding for life sciences R&D is associated with a $0.29 increase (p<.001) in non-federal life
sciences R&D funding. As one would expect, in this model we find no significant impact of
federal R&D funding for other fields (i.e., non-life-sciences) on non-federal life sciences R&D.

Model 4 (corresponding to equations (4) through (6)) presents the results from our
instrumental variables approach, showing that a dollar increase in federal funding leads to a
$0.33 increase (p<0.001) in non-federal life science R&D funding. The Durbin-Wu-Hausman
null hypothesis states that an ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator of the same equation would
yield consistent estimates; our results soundly reject consistency of the OLS estimator (p<0.01).
Our results also show that predicted NIH funding is a strong predictor of federal life sciences
funding, with a F-statistic for the first-stage regression of 244.32.

Effects of University Heterogeneity

In this section, we investigate how effects of federal funding differ by the following
university characteristics: (1) tercile of non-federal life sciences R&D funding received in the
base year (1998), (2) tercile of federal life sciences R&D funding received in the base year
(1998), (3) PhD versus non-PhD-granting status, (4) private versus public institutional control,
and (5) whether the institution was ranked among the top 50 research universities by U.S. News
& World Report. All forty of the institutions in our panel that ranked among the top 50 in U.S.
News & World Report at some point during our sample period are PhD-granting institutions, 25
are private, 27 are in the top tercile for non-federal life sciences R&D funding, and 33 are in the
top tercile for federal life sciences R&D funding.
Table 3 columns (2) through (4) show results of IV regressions by tercile of non-federal
life sciences funding in 1998, the first year of our panel. Federal life sciences R&D funding
leads to a statistically significant increase in non-federal funding for universities in all three
terciles. The greatest effect appears to be in the lowest tercile: for universities that historically
have received relatively low non-federal R&D funding for the life sciences, a dollar increase in
federal funding yields a $0.53 increase in non-federal funding, compared with $0.16 and $0.23
for the second and third terciles.
Columns (5) through (7) report results of IV regressions by tercile of federal life sciences
funding in 1998.

We again find federal life sciences R&D funding is associated with a

statistically significant increase (p<.10) in non-federal funding for universities in all three
terciles, and again the greatest effect seems to be in the lowest tercile: for universities that
historically received relatively low federal R&D funding for the life sciences, a dollar increase in

federal funding yields an estimated $0.91 increase in non-federal funding, compared with $0.54
and $0.21 for the higher two terciles.
Table 4 columns (2) and (3) show results by highest degree granted. The effects of
federal funding are much larger for universities granting only Masters or Bachelors degrees
versus those awarding PhDs in S&E fields. While a dollar increase in federal life sciences R&D
funding at a PhD-granting institution is associated with a $0.32 increase in non-federal funding,
for institutions that do not grant a PhD, a dollar increase in federal funding yields a $1.10
increase in non-federal funding. This difference is statistically significant (α=.05).
In columns (4) and (5), we report results for public versus private universities. At public
universities, a dollar increase in federal life sciences R&D funding is associated with a $0.41
increase in non-federal funding, whereas at private universities a dollar increase in federal life
sciences R&D funding is associated with a $0.25 increase in non-federal funding.
Finally, in columns (6) and (7), we find the non-federal funding response seems also to
be greater for universities not among the top 50 in the U.S. News and World Report rankings.
For these universities, a dollar increase in federal life sciences R&D funding yields only a $0.19
increase in non-federal funding. For all other universities (including top-ranked liberal arts
colleges), the effect appears to be higher: a dollar increase in federal life sciences R&D funding
yields a $0.46 increase in non-federal funding.

Results from instrumental variable regressions with non-federal life sciences funding as the dependent

year. All models include year fixed effects (shown) and university fixed effects. Standard errors are robust
to heteroskedasticity and clustered on university.

In addition to these analyses, we also investigated whether contemporaneous and lagged
federal funding up to three years prior had significant impact on non-federal funding in the life
sciences. We chose a maximum lag of three years, because the average noncompeting duration
for NIH awards is four years. In a finite distributed lag model with university fixed effects, we
find no evidence of substitution, i.e., none of the coefficients for federal funding are significant
and negative. Per Wooldridge (2009), the sum of the coefficients on contemporaneous and
lagged federal R&D can be understood as the effect of a sustained increase in federal life
sciences R&D funding to a university. We find that a sustained one dollar increase in federal
funding is associated with a $0.25 increase in non-federal funding for life sciences R&D
(p=.0001).
3.3

Validation of the IV model

The above IV model will produce unbiased causal estimates of the impact of federal life
sciences funding on non-federal life sciences funding, as long as our instrument satisfies two key
assumptions: first, predicted NIH funding must be strongly correlated with actual federal life
sciences funding; and second, predicted NIH funding must be uncorrelated with any unobserved
time-varying university characteristics that impact non-federal life sciences funding. The first
assumption is testable, and we do so by computing the first-stage F-statistic for our instrument.
However, the second assumption cannot be tested directly. As noted in equation (4), variation in
our instrument over time is based on the share of a university's funding received from a
particular NIC in 1997 and differential growth in aggregate NIC budgets in the following years.
University fixed effects control for differences in total NIH funding across universities in 1997,
so the variation in our instrument arises only from year-to-year changes in the NIC budgets. In
essence, we predict higher NIH funding over time for universities that, in 1997, specialized in

research areas funded by NICs which, in turn, experienced greater growth from 1998 through
2006. The validity of our second assumption relies on the following notions: (a) any shock to a
given NIC's budget for a given year is uncorrelated with the amount of non-federal life sciences
R&D funding a university would receive the following year, except to the extent that non-federal
life sciences funding is itself dependent on NIH funding, and (b) university specialization in the
base year is uncorrelated with other institutional characteristics that make the university more or
less likely to obtain non-federal funding in later periods (e.g., institutional reputation). We
believe these are plausible assumptions, for the reasons discussed below.
3.3.1 Determination of budgets for the National Institutes of Health is unlikely to be related to
non-federal research priorities
The National Institutes of Health provide extramural research funding to universities in
all fifty states.

Each NIC specializes in specific diseases, aspects of human health and

development, or research support, and each is funded by a separate Congressional appropriation.
The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have established parallel appropriations
subcommittees that jointly determine the budget for the NICs, along with competing budgetary
priorities in other health and human services agencies (e.g., the CDC), education, and labor.
The appropriations cycle begins with the President's submission of a recommended
budget to Congress. The President's recommendations are accompanied by detailed justification
statements from each federal agency, including from each of the NICs. Individual members of
Congress then submit prioritized "wish lists" to the appropriations subcommittee based on
requests from their constituents, including disease advocacy and general science lobby groups,
academic institutions, etc. (Kennan, 2005). Both Congressional subcommittees hold hearings
with testimony from NIC officials. Once the subcommittees receive their spending ceilings, the
House committee traditionally acts first to "mark up" an appropriation bill, and the Senate passes

an amended version (for further discussion, see Streeter (2006)). Thus, decisions on the portion
of the budget designated for each NIC are made in response to political demands and perceived
unmet public health needs (e.g., for bioterrorism-related research after 2001), but in tandem with
funding decisions for unrelated aspects of labor and education due to their common spending
cap. After the House and Senate have passed their individual versions of the appropriations bill,
differences are resolved in conference, resulting in a final product called the conference report.
This conference report provides budget appropriations for each NIC, and may include additional
non-binding "report language" encouraging the NICs to pursue research in particular areas or
provide particular funding mechanisms. Within each NIC, however, Congress has generally
avoided specifying amounts for particular fields of research or funding mechanisms, and the
number of such directives has also declined in recent years (Committee on the NIH Research
Priority-Setting Process and Institute of Medicine, 1998). For example, the 2009 Omnibus
Appropriations Bill directs the National Cancer Institute only in the naming of a surgical
fellowship.
Research priorities within each NIC (and, therefore, the amount of funding available to
universities specializing in one research field versus another) are determined by the NIC in
consultation with the Office of the Director. Decision-making with respect to funding particular
proposals is highly decentralized, and funding levels by disease or specialized research area
reflect not only the social and economic costs of particular diseases, but also the quality of
investigator-initiated proposals received by each NIC and their potential for scientific progress.
Thus, while it is certainly conceivable that technological opportunity or some other root cause
might simultaneously increase both federal and non-federal funding for a particular disease (and
thus potentially provide increased availability of both types of funding for a particular

university), such within-NIC research priority shifts are unlikely to be reflected in the aggregate
appropriation by Congress to a particular NIC.
As a first test of this potential confounder, we generated an alternate measure of predicted
NIH funding for university u in year t, based solely on each university's share of total NIH
funding in the base year, and changes in total (aggregate) NIH funding over time. Our results
with this alternate instrument are essentially identical to the original IV approach: we find a
dollar increase in federal life sciences funding results in a $0.36 increase in non-federal life
sciences funding.
Next, we investigated whether increases in NIH funding by institute were associated with
contemporaneous increases in industry R&D for the diseases represented by each NIC. The
dependent variable for this analysis is industry R&D as measured by the number of drugs
entering clinical trials for each disease category (matched to the relevant NIC, as presented in the
Appendix) and year. Matching was based primarily on the lead NIC identified for each disease,
as reported by the MedlinePlus website at the National Library of Medicine; however, this
assignment was supplemented by analysis of the fraction of grants awarded by each NIC that
were classified to each disease in 2006. The algorithm for this classification is detailed in
Blume-Kohout (2009). For example, whereas the primary NIH organization for research on
allergies is the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), we found
extramural research grants for respiratory allergies were more commonly funded by the National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), and so assigned treatments for respiratory allergies to
that NIC. The key explanatory variable is log(NIC Budget) where the dollar amounts are
adjusted by the Biomedical Research and Development Price Index (BRDPI).

Due to evidence of moderate overdispersion, in lieu of Poisson we estimated an
unconditional negative binomial model with NIC and year fixed effects. We found no significant
relationship between NIH funding and contemporaneous pharmaceutical R&D (coefficient -.082,
p=.833, with robust standard errors clustered on NIC). Expressing NIC budget funding in levels
rather than logs yielded very similar results. These results support our assumption that shocks to
universities' federal R&D funding due to changes in NIC budgets are unlikely to be accompanied
by contemporaneous shocks to university funding from industry sources.
3.3.2 University baseline shares are uncorrelated with other characteristics affecting
likelihood of receiving non-federal funding
The university baseline shares in 1997 used for our instrument are intended to indicate
the specialization of each university across research fields, and research fields are strongly tied to
particular NICs.

If universities with stronger research reputations, or other characteristics

affecting their likelihood of receiving non-federal funding, specialized in research areas that
were funded by the NICs that grew most rapidly after 1997, this could invalidate our instrument.
To investigate this possibility, we tested whether the share of funding each university received
from each NIC in the base year was correlated with other observable characteristics found to
influence non-federal funding, including whether the university grants PhD degrees, whether the
university is private or public, whether the university is ranked among the top 50 research
universities in U.S. News and World Report, and how much funding the university received in
fields other than life sciences during the sample period. To implement this test, for each NIC we
regressed the share of each university's NIH funding in 1997 awarded by that NIC on these
university characteristics. Applying the Bonferroni correction α/N for multiple regressions,
where α = .05 and N represents the 22 NICs that funded universities in our panel in the base year,
we find only one significant association between university characteristics and NIC funding

share: universities granting PhDs received disproportionately more funding from the National
Cancer Institute in our base year than universities granting only bachelor's and master's degrees.
Public versus private, top 50 versus unranked, and university non-life-sciences funding levels
(both federal and non-federal) all had no impact on the share of funding universities received
from each NIC. For the 21 other NICs, PhD-granting also had no significant impact.
Finally, we tested whether our results are robust to using an earlier base year for our
analysis. Doing so guards against the possibility that, based on information available about future
funding changes, universities had already altered their specialization in the benchmark base year
of 1997. Such anticipatory behavior is unlikely for a base year further removed from the sample
period. To implement this test, we calculate NIC shares for each university in 1992 instead of
1997, predict NIH funding for each university, and use this alternate measure of predicted NIH
funding to instrument for federal life science funding. The results are almost identical to our
main analysis: for example, we estimate $0.36 in non-federal funding per federal life sciences
dollar (p<.001), with point elasticity (at the average) of 0.59.
3.3.3 IV results show very little correlation between federal life sciences funding and nonfederal funding in seemingly unrelated fields
As an additional validity check, we use our instrumental variables approach to test
whether changes in federal life sciences funding were associated with changes in non-federal
funding for other S&E fields including social sciences, psychology, computer science,
engineering, physical sciences, mathematical sciences, and environmental sciences. In principle,
we should expect little relationship between federal life sciences funding and non-federal
funding in these largely unrelated fields, provided our IV approach controls for differences in
fundraising effort, university reputation, and other time-varying university characteristics. To
the extent there is spillover, we would expect it mainly in the other, non-life-sciences fields that

NIH also funds. In 2006, approximately 84% of NIH funding for basic and applied research at
U.S. universities was for life sciences, 6% was for psychology, 3% was for engineering, 1.7%
was for physical sciences, 1.4% was for environmental sciences, 1% was for social sciences, and
less than 1% was for mathematical and computer sciences.6 As expected, we find little causal
relationship between federal life science funding (using the predicted NIH funding instrument)
and non-federal funding in these fields, The only significant effects found were for non-federal
social sciences funding (1.8 cents per federal dollar), physical sciences (1.3 cents per federal
dollar), environmental sciences (0.7 cents per federal dollar), and mathematics (0.2 cents per
federal dollar), generally tracking the NIH funding levels described above, and much lower than
the 33-cent increase seen for non-federal life sciences funding. The sole exception to this pattern
was for social sciences research, which may simply reflect differences in overall availability of
nonfederal funding for social sciences versus other fields.
3.3.4 Inclusion of time-varying university rankings has no impact on our results
If our IV approach were invalid, then changes in the quality or reputation of a university
over time would likely impact both federal and non-federal funding, confounding our results. To
test for this possibility, we include as a covariate the U.S. News and World Report rank, year-byyear, for each university in our panel that at some point during the sample period was ranked
among the top 50 national universities.7 Changes in university rank over time had no impact on
our estimate, and the coefficient on rank was insignificant (robust t-statistic 0.38), suggesting
that university fixed effects coupled with our IV approach are adequate to describe the impact of
university ranking on R&D funding.

4.

Discussion
As discussed above, the effect of public (federal) research funding on private or non-

federal funding is an issue of much debate. A priori, there could be a negative (substitution)
effect, either due to crowding out of private investment or because researchers could stop
seeking other sources of funding once they receive federal funding. On the other hand, federal
R&D funding could also have a positive impact due to complementarity or signaling effects.
Careful empirical analysis is needed to parse these opposing effects.
In a panel of 272 U.S. universities, with data on federal and non-federal life sciences
R&D funding spanning nearly a decade, we find that increased federal funding is associated with
increased non-federal funding. This result is robust to econometric specifications that correct for
omitted latent variables that could be responsible for increases in both types of funding. Our
evidence also suggests that, in addition to providing support for research, successful applications
for federal life sciences funding may be interpreted by private and non-federal organizations as a
signal of the quality of the recipient institutions. Less research-focused universities (i.e., those
not granting PhDs in S&E fields), and those that historically received lower levels of federal and
non-federal funding appear to experience greater increases in non-federal funding for each
federal dollar received. This is consistent with the observation by Payne (2001) that federal
organizations such as the NIH may serve to correct asymmetries in information between
universities and their prospective non-federal funders.
Our result is also qualitatively similar to that found by Diamond (1999), who used
aggregate, annual time series data from 1953-1995 to study the connection between federal and
private spending on basic research in science. However, his estimate is quantitatively much
lower than ours: he found that a dollar increase in federal spending was associated with only an

additional $0.08 in academic spending, compared with $0.33 in our analysis. Our use of the
university as a unit of analysis, and reliance on cross-sectional as well as time-series variation (as
opposed to aggregate time-series variation alone) might partly account for this difference.
By enabling universities to attract more private resources, federal life sciences R&D
funding may also influence the eventual commercialization of university research. However, to
understand the mechanisms by which federal funding results in commercial products such as
life-saving drugs, one should look at broader outcomes such as university patenting and licensing
behavior, and alliances between universities and the private sector. Qualitative research with
not-for-profit foundations and other non-federal funders could serve to confirm the suggested
signaling effect; however, a more structural approach is needed to disentangle this effect from
complementarity between federal and non-federal funds in the production of knowledge. These
are subjects for our future research.

Federal obligations for biological, medical, and life sciences not elsewhere classified totaled
83.5% of NIH funding to universities and colleges. Data are based on author's calculations
using the NSF Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development, available at:

We are very grateful to Bhaven Sampat at Columbia University who provided us with analytic
data files extracted from NIH administrative records for years 1997-2003, including the
financial amount of each award, and to Pierre Azoulay who provided a list of NIH grantee
organizations coded by type (e.g., institutions of higher education). These data were obtained
via FOIA requests. Data for years 2004-2006 were downloaded from the NIH website at:
http://www.report.nih.gov/award/awardtr.cfm

The NSF estimated total life sciences R&D expenditures at U.S. universities and colleges as
$28.8 billion in 2006. See: http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf08300/pdf/tab4.pdf

4

While the linear model does exhibit increasing variance in the residuals with higher levels of
non-federal funding, there is no evidence of any upward or downward trend suggesting
misspecification, and log transformation of the financial amounts appears to overcorrect rather
than stabilize the variance. Thus, the data do not recommend log transformation, our estimates
should be both unbiased and consistent except as discussed above, and the observed
heteroskedasticity can be accommodated simply by our calculation of robust standard errors.
We calculate robust clustered standard errors for the instrumental variables models using
XTIVREG2 (Schaffer, 2005).

5

Despite our misgivings about this alternate specification, we did nonetheless estimate each of
our models described above for this restricted panel, using log-transformed financial amounts.

For models (1)-(3), we find significant positive coefficients (p<.01) ranging from 0.925 for
model (1) to 0.492 for model (3). However, for this restricted panel of institutions already
receiving non-zero federal and non-federal funding both for life sciences and for other S&E
fields, the instrumental variables approach with constant-elasticity specification indicates no
significant impact of lagged federal life sciences funding on non-federal life sciences funding.
Rather, for these institutions, receipt of non-federal life sciences funding appears to be most
strongly and significantly correlated with the university's contemporaneous successes in
attracting non-federal funding for other science and engineering fields.
