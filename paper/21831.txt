JEL No. I24,I28,J15
ABSTRACT
This descriptive paper documents how segregation between blacks and whites across colleges in the
United States has evolved since the 1960s. It also explores potential channels through which changes
are occurring, and it uses recent data to study the issue of segregation within colleges. The main findings
are as follows: (1) White exposure to blacks has been rising since the 1960s, whereas black exposure
to whites increased sharply in the late 1960s and early 1970s and has fluctuated since then. Meanwhile,
black-white dissimilarity and the Theil index fell sharply in the late 1960s and early 1970s and have
fallen more gradually since. (2) There has been regional convergence, although colleges in the South
remain more segregated than those in any other region when measured by dissimilarity, by the Theil
index, or by black exposure to whites. (3) A major channel for the decline in segregation is the declining
share of blacks attending historically black colleges and universities. (4) Although there is segregation
within universities, most segregation across major × university cells occurs across universities.

I. Introduction
In the early twentieth century, Southern states operated dual systems of higher education,
and universities in other regions of the country enrolled very few African-American students.
But then several important Supreme Court rulings held that the separate higher education
accommodations provided to blacks were in fact unequal (Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada in
1938, Sipuel v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma in 1948, and Sweatt v. Painter
and McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education in 1950), which helped set the
stage for the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ruling that separate can never be equal. Some
states took longer than others to integrate their colleges, but U.S. colleges today are open to
students of all races. But as evidenced by affirmative action bans in several states, recent court
rulings, ongoing college desegregation litigation, and the fact that the Supreme Court recently
heard the affirmative action cases Fisher v. University of Texas and Schuette v. Coalition to
Defend Affirmative Action, issues of race and higher education are still high on the public policy
agenda. Further, colleges today are less segregated than they were a century ago, but students of
different races still have differing enrollment patterns.
The main purpose of this descriptive paper is to document how racial segregation
between blacks and whites has evolved across four-year colleges in the United States since the
1960s and to consider some potential channels through which changes are occurring. Although
little is known about racial segregation at the college level, research on K-12 schools has found
negative effects of racial segregation on students and has found positive effects of desegregation
plans (Guryan 2004; Johnson 2010, 2011; Reber 2010; Weiner, Lutz, and Ludwig 2009).
Moreover, the Supreme Court has taken the view in two important affirmative action cases,
1978’s Regents of the University of California v. Bakke and 2003’s Grutter v. Bollinger, that

2

affirmative action is constitutional on the grounds that there are educational benefits to racial
diversity. Furthermore, racial segregation across colleges may have important implications for
social networks, job networks, and housing patterns. This may in turn affect incomes, economic
inequality, and social cohesion. But even though little is certain about the consequences of racial
segregation in higher education, documenting its extent and considering some explanations for
its trends should be a worthwhile step toward a more complete understanding of racial
segregation at the college level. Because there is so little existing evidence even about the extent
of racial segregation at the college level, a study that thoroughly addresses this topic has the
potential to uncover important facts that will help guide future research.
In showing how the level of racial segregation has changed over the years, I utilize data
on the racial composition of nearly every college in the continental 48 states and the District of
Columbia in the even years between 1968 and 1988 and every year between 1990 and 2011. I
also make use of data on the racial compositions of public universities in the South every year
from 1960 to 1967. I employ standard measures of segregation such as the index of white
exposure to blacks, the index of black exposure to whites, the black-white dissimilarity index,
and the Theil index to study how segregation has evolved nationally. I also examine differences
by geographic region and public/private control, and I explore potential channels for changes in
segregation over time. At the end of the paper I use data from 2011 to study the issue of
segregation across majors within colleges. The main results are:
(1) White exposure to blacks has been rising since the 1960s, whereas black exposure to
whites increased sharply in the late 1960s and early 1970s and has fluctuated since
then. Meanwhile, black-white dissimilarity and the Theil index fell sharply in the late
1960s and early 1970s and have fallen more gradually since.

3

(2) There has been regional convergence, although colleges in the South remain more
segregated than those in any other region when measured by dissimilarity or by black
exposure to whites.
(3) A major channel for the decline in segregation, especially in the South, is the
declining share of blacks attending historically black colleges and universities.
(4) Although there is segregation within universities, most segregation across major ×
university cells occurs across universities.
The next section of this paper discusses previous related research, and the following section
discusses the data. The next three sections show results for segregation across colleges. After
that, I consider the issue of segregation within colleges, and I conclude by summarizing the
results and discussing possible directions for future research.

II. Previous Research
There has been a large amount of research on racial segregation in contexts other than
higher education in recent years, especially in the context of elementary and secondary schools.
This work on elementary and secondary schools includes descriptive work (Clotfelter 2004;
Cascio et al. 2008; Rivkin and Welch 2006) and research on the impact of financial incentives on
desegregation (Cascio et al. 2010). It also includes work on the effects of K-12 desegregation
policy on segregation levels (Reber 2005), school district finances (Reber 2011), housing prices
(Boustan 2012), residential and school choices (Baum-Snow and Lutz 2011), educational
outcomes (Guryan 2004; Reber 2010; Johnson 2011), economic outcomes (Johnson 2011),

4

health (Johnson 2010, 2011), and crime (Weiner, Lutz, and Ludwig 2009; Johnson 2011). 1
Clotfelter, Vigdor, and Ladd (2006); Lutz (2011); and Reardon et al. (2012) have studied
whether there is “resegregation” now that desegregation plans are being lifted. Billings, Deming,
and Rockoff (2014) study the effects of ending a desegregation plan on academic outcomes and
crime. Apart from the study of schools, other areas of recent research interest include residential
segregation (Ananat 2011; Ananat and Washington 2009; Boustan 2011; Card, Mas, and
Rothstein 2008; Card and Rothstein 2007; La Ferrara and Mele 2007); labor market segregation
(Hellerstein and Neumark 2008; Hellerstein, Neumark, and McInerney 2008); and hospital
desegregation (Almond, Chay, and Greenstone 2006; Chay, Guryan, and Mazumder 2009).
Although racial segregation in other contexts has been thoroughly studied, there is very
little research on segregation at the college level. A notable exception is Clotfelter (2004, Ch. 6),
who documents segregation levels at U.S. colleges and universities in 1976, 1986, and 1998. 2
Clotfelter (2004, Ch. 6) also makes use of selected pre-1976 data by reporting racial
compositions of a set of 28 selective institutions in 1951, 1967, and 1970; showing the exposure
rate of whites to nonwhites for a sample of 175 institutions for 1970 as well as the four-year
private institutions among them for 1967; and reporting a segregation index for four-year public
institutions in the South in 1961, 1965, and 1970. This paper adds to Clotfelter (2004, Ch. 6) by
taking the full sample of universities farther back in time, going farther forward in time, and
exploring the dynamics of segregation over shorter intervals (every other year from 1968 to 1988
and year-to-year from 1990 to 2011). I also consider some explanations for the observed trends,
1

Rivkin and Welch (2006) provide useful background information and a review of earlier research on elementary
and secondary school desegregation. For another overview, see Vigdor (2011). For a recent cross-country study of
segregation, see Alesina and Zhuravskaya (2011).
2
Another piece about racial segregation at the college level, albeit not about segregation in the overall student body,
is Goff, McCormick, and Tollison (2002). That paper finds that winning Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC)
basketball teams integrated first and that doing so further improved their records. Additionally, see Arcidiacono
(2005), Arcidiacono et al. (2014), Hinrichs (2012, 2014), Howell (2010), and Long (2004) on the issue of race-based
affirmative action.

show the full distribution of exposure in addition to showing the average, and consider
segregation across majors within colleges. To the extent that it is possible to compare, the results
in Clotfelter (2004, Ch. 6) and this paper are broadly consistent. However, some important
results emerge from using the additional data, including the fact that there was a large decline in
segregation between 1968 and 1972, the trends in segregation since 1998, and the fact that
changes in segregation are generally more gradual than episodic.

III. Data
The data I use in most of the analysis are data on fall full-time undergraduate enrollment
by race for nearly every four-year college in the continental United States. These data exist for
the even years from 1968 to 1988 and for every year from 1990 to 2011. The data since 1986
come from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), data from 1976-1984
come from the Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS), and data for the earlier
years come from surveys conducted by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) whose results I
digitized (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare Office for Civil Rights 1969,
1972, 1974, 1976).
Although other racial groups have played an increasingly prominent role in American
higher education over the years, there are several reasons why this paper focuses on segregation
between blacks and whites. First, much of the history of race relations in the United States
centers around blacks and whites. Second, as seen in Figure 1, representation of other racial
groups at U.S. colleges and universities was limited until recently. Third, although the results
are not reported here, the overall trends in segregation between underrepresented minorities
collectively (i.e., combining blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans into one group) and whites

6

and also between non-whites and whites are similar to the trends in segregation between blacks
and whites. Many of the same trends are also evident when examining particular minority
groups other than blacks, as well.
A few additional points about the data are in order. First, I exclude Alaska and Hawaii
from the analysis because these states do not appear in the data I employ until 1976. However,
the main results are not sensitive to the exclusion or inclusion of colleges in these states. 3
Second, I focus on four-year colleges. But although not shown here, many of the trends with
two-year colleges are similar. One difference, though, is that black-white dissimilarity fluctuates
more across two-year colleges than across four-year colleges, even though in both cases the
general trend is toward less segregation. Third, although again the results are not shown here,
the same general trends in segregation are seen when limiting the data to a balanced panel of
universities that appear in the data set in each year. However, entry and exit of colleges may be
an important channel through which changes in segregation occur, which is why the results
shown in this paper include the full sample available in each year. Fourth, due to the nature of
the data, my calculations of segregation by region are based on region of college attendance
rather than region of residence. However, most students attend college in their home census
region. For example, according to my calculations from the 2011 IPEDS Residence and
Migration survey, 89.5% of four-year college students in 2011 attended a college in their home
region. 4 It is also worth noting that, to the extent that college students live near their college
after they exit, studying college racial segregation by the census region of college attendance
may provide some information about later residential segregation or segregation of friendship
groups.
3

On the other hand, I keep data from West Virginia even though data from that state are missing in 1970. But
again, the main results are not sensitive to this decision.
4
The data do not permit breaking this figure down by race.

7

To help put the later results on segregation in context, Figure 1 shows how the racial
composition of colleges overall has evolved. The figure reveals that colleges in the U.S. have
become less white and more black over time. The figure also shows that representation of other
racial groups was limited until recently. Although not shown here, analysis of data from the
October Current Population Survey education supplements from 1968 to 2010 suggests that the
rising ratio of blacks to whites in four-year colleges comes about at least in part because of a
rising ratio of blacks to whites in the college-aged population. Trends in the black-white relative
four-year college attendance rate are more difficult to discern with the CPS data, although blacks
in recent years do seem to be attending college at a relatively higher rate compared to whites
than they did in the earlier years.

IV. Exposure
One way of conceptualizing segregation is as isolation, which can lead to methods of
measuring segregation based on exposure indexes. The principle is to measure how much
contact students may potentially have with members of various races. I begin by showing the
extent to which whites are attending college with blacks by using the index of white exposure to
blacks. Suppose there are N colleges; that there are W white students overall; and that college i
enrolls wi white students, bi black students, hi Hispanic students, ai Asian students, and ni
Native American students. Then the exposure index of whites to blacks is defined as

100 ×

1
W

N

∑w
i =1

i

bi
. This measures the percentage of students at the average
wi + bi + hi + ai + ni

white student’s university who are black. Lower values of this index correspond to higher levels
of segregation.

8

Figure 2 shows that white exposure to blacks has been rising almost continuously over
time. 5 In 1968, the typical white student attended a college that was 2.3% black. By 2011, this
had risen to 10.2%. This increase may be partly attributed to the rising share of blacks amongst
four-year college students seen in Figure 1. Black representation overall rose from 5.5% to
13.9% over this period. However, the magnitude of the increase in exposure in proportional
terms is much larger than the increase in black composition overall, which suggests that changes
in choices of which colleges to attend may also be partly responsible for the increase in
exposure. Figure 2 also reveals that at one time whites were more exposed to blacks at public
universities but now are at private universities. Table 1 shows that the states with the lowest
exposure of whites to blacks in both 1968 and 2011 were Western states with low black
populations. There have, however, been some changes in the states with the greatest exposure of
blacks to whites. In 1968 these tended to be Midwestern states such as Michigan and Illinois,
whereas in 2011 they were Southern states with large black populations such as Mississippi and
Georgia. It is also worth noting that exposure of whites to blacks increased dramatically at the
higher end. The highest value in 1968 was 6.0% in the District of Columbia, whereas the highest
value in 2011 was Mississippi’s 25.9%. Figure 3 further explores regional differences.
Exposure of whites to blacks has risen in each census region. The increase has been particularly
large in the South, although in recent years there has been a spike in white exposure to blacks in
the West. 6
The exposure index of whites to blacks gives the percentage of students who are black at
the average white student’s university, but it may also be of interest to study the full distribution
5

Although not shown here, the results are similar when calculating the denominator as simply wi+bi.
This large increase in the West in recent years is in large part due to the University of Phoenix. If this institution is
dropped from the analysis, the increase in white exposure to blacks in the West in recent years becomes less
dramatic and Arizona is no longer one of the states with the highest exposure of whites to blacks. However, the
other results in the paper are substantively the same.

6

9

over which this average is taken. For example, one way in which an exposure index of 10 could
come about is through all white students attending colleges that are 10% black, but a different
way it could come about is through 90% of whites attending colleges that are 1% black and 10%
of whites attending colleges that are 91% black. These two distributions have very different
implications for the experience of the modal student. In order to investigate exposure in more
detail, Figure 4 plots the distribution for white students of the percentage of students who attend
their college who are black at four points in time: 1968, 1982, 1996, and 2011. The distribution
in 1968 has a very high peak at very low levels of percent black, showing that many white
students attended colleges enrolled very few blacks. This peak has fallen dramatically over time
as the distribution has shifted to the right, which shows that white students are not only on
average attending colleges that have greater black representation but that they are doing so
throughout the distribution.
It is also useful to measure the extent to which blacks attend college with whites by using
the index of black exposure to whites. Using the same notation as before and letting B refer to
the total number of black college students, this is defined as 100 ×

wi
1 N
bi
.
∑
B i =1 wi + bi + hi + ai + ni

This measures the percentage of white students at the average black student’s college. The index
of black exposure to whites need not reveal the same trends in segregation as the index of white
exposure to blacks if, as is actually the case, the racial composition of the overall pool of
students is changing over time.
Figure 5 shows that black exposure to whites increased sharply in the late 1960s and
early 1970s but has fluctuated since then. 7 In 1968, the typical black student attended a college
that was 38.6% white. By 1972, this had risen to 51.2%. In 2011, this figure stood at 48.7%.
7

Although not shown here, the results are again similar when calculating the denominator as simply wi+bi.

10

The figure also reveals that blacks have greater exposure to whites at public universities,
although the trends over time are similar between publics and privates. Table 2 shows which
states had the highest and lowest black exposure to whites in 1968 and 2011. In both years,
Western and New England states with large white populations were the ones with the highest
exposure of blacks to whites. Southern states are heavily represented amongst those with the
lowest exposure in both years. However, the table also shows that there was a large increase in
exposure at the lower end between 1968 and 2011. For example, only 3.6% of students at the
college of the average black student in North Carolina were white in 1968, but this had risen to
35.0% by 2011. Figure 6 shows trends by census region over time. The most striking result here
is the regional convergence. The South had much lower exposure of blacks to whites than the
other regions in 1968, but exposure of blacks to whites there has risen over time. There was an
especially large increase in the 1970s. Meanwhile, exposure of blacks to whites has fallen in the
other regions. This falling exposure is surely in large part due to the declining white
representation overall observed in Figure 1, but it is also worth noting that it comes at a time
when inequality in the labor market, for example, is generally rising (Autor, Katz, and Kearney
2008).
Figure 7 shows the full distribution of percent white for black students in 1968, 1982,
1996, and 2011. In 1968 the distribution was bimodal, with a large peak near 0 and a substantial
amount of mass at very high levels of percent white. Black students of this time period thus
experienced polar opposite college racial compositions. But the distribution of percent white for
black students has become much more uniform over time. There still are black students who
enroll at colleges that enroll few whites, although this is much less common than before. It is

11

also much more common for black students to attend colleges that enroll intermediate
percentages of white students.

V. Black-White Dissimilarity
Changes in exposure come about through both changes in the overall representation of
the various racial groups and changes in how evenly those groups are distributed across colleges.
It may be useful to isolate the changes in how evenly students of different racial groups are
distributed across different colleges in a way that is not sensitive to the overall sizes of the
groups. One way to do so is with the black-white dissimilarity index, which is defined as
100 ×

1 N bi wi
∑ − . This measures the percentage of members of one racial group who would
2 i =1 B W

need to switch colleges in order for all colleges to have the same ratio of white to black students
as one another. Higher values of the dissimilarity index correspond to greater segregation.
Figure 8 reveals that black-white dissimilarity fell sharply in the late 1960s and early
1970s and has fallen gradually since then. In 1968, 63.9% of whites (or 63.9% of blacks) would
have needed to move to a different university in order for all universities to have the same ratio
of white to black students as one another. This figure had dropped to 52.5% by 1972 and to
48.0% by 2011. Figure 8 also reveals that the private sector is more segregated than the public
sector when segregation is measured by the black-white dissimilarity index. A similarity
between Figures 2, 5, and 8 is the large decline in segregation between 1968 and 1972. To put
the magnitudes of the black-white dissimilarity index in higher education in perspective, Rivkin
and Welch (2006) report that the black-white dissimilarity index in elementary and secondary
schools in the United States was 81.2% in 1968 and 68.7% in 2000. Thus, the higher education
sector is less segregated than the K-12 sector when measured by black-white dissimilarity. In
12

fact, K-12 schools were more segregated in 2000 than colleges and universities were in 1968.
However, one point to keep in mind when comparing segregation at the college level to
segregation at the elementary and secondary level is that college attendance is not compulsory,
and so the results do not necessarily measure the extent of segregation experienced by all
individuals of college age in their daily lives. Furthermore, if college attendance rates change,
the results may be sensitive to the type of college attended by the marginal student. But despite
this caveat, the results should still be valid as a measure of segregation amongst those students
who are enrolled in college.
Table 3 shows which states were the most and least segregated according to the blackwhite dissimilarity index in 1968 and 2011. The states with the lowest dissimilarity indexes tend
to be Western states, especially in 2011 but also to a lesser extent in 1968. The list of the most
segregated states in 1968 includes Deep South states like Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. In
2011, these states are missing from the list, but the list includes the border states Maryland and
Delaware, as well as the District of Columbia. It is also noteworthy that the most segregated
states in 2011 were much less segregated than the most segregated states in 1968. For example,
in Virginia in 1968, nearly 97% of students of one race would have needed to switch colleges in
order for all colleges to have the same ratio of white to black students as one another. North
Carolina appears in a similar slot in the two lists, but the dissimilarity index had fallen by nearly
35 percentage points between 1968 and 2011.
Figure 9 shows trends by region over time. This figure clearly demonstrates regional
convergence. Segregation has fallen dramatically over time in the South, and it has increased in
the other regions. But despite this regional convergence and dramatic decline in segregation in
the South, colleges in the South have consistently remained more segregated than those in any

13

other region when measured by dissimilarity or by black exposure to whites. This is in contrast
to the case of K-12 schools, in which, at least from 1972 to 2000, schools in the South were
actually less segregated than those in other regions (Clotfelter 2004, Table 2.1; Rivkin and
Welch 2006, Table 4). 8 A simple explanation for the lower K-12 segregation but higher college
segregation in the South is that it may be more difficult to desegregate colleges than elementary
and secondary schools. For example, college attendance is not compulsory, and students
generally have more choice of which college to attend than which high school to attend. It is
more common to move away for college than it is for high school, and the private sector, which
is less subject to government oversight than the public sector, is larger for colleges than for K-12.
Although parents choose elementary and secondary schools through residential location choices,
there is no analog of “forced busing” or “attendance zones” in higher education. This high level
of choice in higher education may facilitate racial segregation at the college level. On the other
hand, since colleges generally have wider catchment areas than elementary and secondary school
districts, college desegregation policy is not limited by residential segregation to the extent that
elementary and secondary desegregation policy is.
Figure 10 gives evidence of the decline in segregation in South over a longer time period
by using data on Southern public universities going back to 1960. The pre-1968 data consist of
information from a Chronicle of Higher Education article that published results from an Office
for Civil Rights survey on the racial compositions of colleges enrolling 500 students or more in
1967, as well as reports from the Southern Education Reporting Service (SERS) on the racial
compositions of public universities in the South from 1960-1966 (Southern Education Reporting

8

Additionally, when compared to the results for elementary and secondary schools presented by Rivkin and Welch
(2006), elementary and secondary schools in the South show a similar level of segregation to colleges and
universities in that region over the years. In other regions, however, K-12 schools are more segregated than colleges
are.

14

Service 1961a, 1961b, 1962, 1963-64, 1964-65, 1965-66, 1966-67; The Chronicle of Higher
Education 1968). Contrary to the case of the other data sources used in this study, there is a fair
amount of missing data in the SERS reports. But taking the results at face value, Figure 10
reveals that the decline in black-white dissimilarity in the South is even more dramatic when
viewed over a longer period of time. Furthermore, the public university systems in Alabama,
Mississippi, and South Carolina were completely segregated at the beginning of the time period I
examine, and the university systems in all the Southern states were completely segregated in the
beginning part of the twentieth century. Thus, extrapolating the results in Figure 10 back in time
would make the decline in segregation appear yet more dramatic. 9

VI. Theil Index
A strength of the dissimilarity index as a measure of unevenness is that its magnitudes
have a natural interpretation as the percentage of members of one group who would need to
switch colleges in order for colleges to be racially balanced. A weakness, however, is that the
dissimilarity index does not allow one to partition segregation into different components in order
to take a closer look at why segregation exists (Reardon, Yun, and Eitle 2000). I thus turn to an
alternative index, the Theil index, which does allow for such decompositions.
The Theil index is built up from a measure of entropy. Letting P =

pi =

B
and
B +W

bi
1
1
, the overall entropy is defined as E = P ⋅ ln + (1 − P ) ⋅ ln
and the entropy at
bi + wi
P
1− P

9

However, one caveat is that, as Wallenstein (2009) points out, blacks attended the University of South Carolina as
undergraduates during Reconstruction, so references to “the first black student to attend a white university in the
South” often actually refer to the first student to do so in the twentieth century. Furthermore, the University of
Alabama had briefly enrolled a black student in 1956, but public institutions in Alabama were completely segregated
again after that.

college i is defined as Ei = pi ⋅ ln

difficult to interpret, these functions are maximized at and are also symmetric about P = .5 and
pi = .5 . They are thus measures of racial imbalance. The Theil index, defined as

H = 100 × ∑ (
i =1

bi + wi E − Ei
)(
) , is an enrollment-weighted average of how the entropy at
B +W
E

particular colleges differs from overall entropy.
Higher values of the Theil index correspond to higher levels of segregation. Comparing
Figure 11, Figure 12, and Table 4 to Figure 8, Figure 9, and Table 3 shows that trends in
segregation as measured by the Theil index are similar to trends in segregation as measured by
the dissimilarity index. However, unlike the dissimilarity index, the Theil index allows for
decompositions that partition segregation additively into different components. These
decompositions are an accounting exercise and do not necessarily answer any specific causal
question. However, they may still be useful for identifying channels through which changes in
segregation occur and for ruling out other channels.
I first partition segregation into a within-state component and an across-state component.
One potential reason why there is segregation between blacks and whites is that blacks and
whites live in different states from one another, or at least choose to attend colleges in different
states from one another. On the other hand, there may be substantial segregation within states.
Letting H S refer to the quantity obtained when aggregating the data up to the state level and
calculating the Theil index across the 48 states in the data and the District of Columbia, H s refer
to the Theil index within state s , E s refer to the entropy within state s , Bs refer to the number
of blacks attending college within state s , and Ws refer to the number of whites attending college

16

49

within state s , the Theil index can be written as H = H S + ∑ (
s =1

Bs + Ws E s
)
⋅ H s . The first term
B +W E

on the right-hand side is the cross-state component, and the second term is the within-state
component. 10 Figure 13 displays the results when performing this decomposition for each year
of the data. The results show that the within-state component is much larger than the betweenstate component and also that, at least in an accounting sense, the overall Theil index has been
falling primarily because the within-state component is falling. This leaves open the question of
why the within-state component has been falling, but it suggests that differences in the states in
which whites and blacks attend college are not the major contributor to segregation or to its
decline over time.
A potential channel through which the decline in racial segregation over time is occurring
is the large decline in the share of black college students who are attending historically black
colleges and universities (HBCUs). HBCUs are higher education institutions that were created
prior to 1964 with the goal of educating black Americans, and the vast majority of them are
located in the South. Private HBCUs were primarily founded in the latter half of the nineteenth
century by Northern missionaries and philanthropists, and many of the public HBCUs are the
consequence of the 1890 Second Morrill Act, which prohibited federal land grant funding from
going to states that operated universities intended for students of one race unless they also

operated universities for students of other races. Over 100 HBCUs still exist today, the large
majority of which are four-year institutions.
Figure 14 shows that as recently as 1970 over half of black college students enrolled in a
four-year college were enrolled in an HBCU. That share is now down to less than 20%.
Meanwhile, although whites are eligible to attend HBCUs, Figure 14 shows that a very small
fraction of white college students choose to do so. Figure 15 reveals that, whereas non-HBCUs
enroll a mix of racial groups, HBCUs continue to have a largely black student body. This figure
may even give the impression that there are more whites at the typical HBCU than there actually
are, since a large share of the white HBCU attendance is concentrated at a small number of
HBCUs that have large white representations. Two HBCUs in West Virginia, Bluefield State
College and West Virginia State University, were 87.2% and 78.7% white in 2011. Lincoln
University in Missouri was over half white at one point and was 41.9% white in 2011. These
three institutions combined enrolled 34.4% of the whites enrolled at HBCUs in 2011. On the
opposite extreme are institutions such as Lane College, a private HBCU in Tennessee that was
100% black in 2011, and Spelman College, which was 99.5% black in 2011 and enrolled no
whites. The median HBCU in 2011 was 96.6% black. Because HBCUs have a predominantly
black enrollment and non-HBCUs do not, as seen in Figure 15, the shift in black enrollment from
HBCUs to non-HBCUs observed in Figure 14 would presumably decrease measured segregation.
To study the relationship between HBCU attendance and racial segregation across
colleges more formally, I divide colleges into two sectors: HBCUs and traditionally white
institutions (TWIs, or non-HBCUs). Figure 16 presents results from decomposing the Theil
index into a between-sector component and a within-sector component. The results suggest that
in the earlier part of the time period I study, most segregation was attributable to the fact that a

18

large share of blacks attended HBCUs but very few whites did. However, the amount of
segregation attributable to the between-sector component has been falling over time, whereas the
within-sector component has actually been rising. This trend has occurred to such a large extent
that the within-sector component of segregation now outweighs the between-sector component.
Although it appears that the decline in HBCU enrollment has resulted in a lower level of
segregation, the effect of HBCUs on segregation levels is just one factor that should be taken
into account when evaluating the merits of HBCUs. 11 For example, it is well known that
HBCUs have a long history of being a training ground for black leaders. They may provide a
welcoming atmosphere for black students and remedial education opportunities for
underprepared students. Mykerezi and Mills (2008) find that HBCUs led to higher wage growth
for black males using the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Fryer and Greenstone
(2010) find that the returns to attending an HBCU were positive in the 1970s, but they do find
that the returns were negative in the 1990s.
Fryer and Greenstone’s findings may be useful in explaining the declining HBCU
attendance seen in Figure 14 and the accompanying reduction in segregation seen in Figure 16,
or vice versa. On the one hand, the lower return to attending an HBCU may cause an enrollment
shift away from HBCUs and toward non-HBCUs. On the other hand, the lower return may be a
consequence of the enrollment shift if, for example, lower enrollments made HBCUs less
efficient or if high-ability black students (or faculty) left HBCUs for non-HBCUs and left the
remaining students in a lesser position to benefit from peer effects. A third possibility, however,
is that declining black HBCU enrollment is somewhat mechanical. The number of HBCUs
presumably will not increase over time, since they are carryovers of an earlier era when Southern
11

In addition, to the extent that HBCUs are drawing in students who would not attend college otherwise, it is not
clear that it should be cause for concern that HBCUs are increasing racial segregation amongst those who are
enrolled in college.

19

states operated dual systems of higher education and higher education opportunities for blacks
were extremely limited. In fact, federal legislation defines HBCUs as having existed prior to
1964. Thus, under this definition, any increase in HBCU enrollment would need to come about
through increases in enrollment at existing HBCUs rather than through entry of new HBCUs. To
the extent that the existing HBCUs have limited capacity to expand, it is natural that a smaller
share of black college students will be attending HBCUs over time as the number of black
college students rises. In fact, in results not shown here, I find that the count of black students
enrolled at HBCUs has actually risen over time but that this increase has not been as large as the
increase in the number of black college students overall.

VII. Segregation within Colleges
Even if blacks and whites are attending the same colleges as one another, this does not
mean that they are friends with one another or that they are taking the same courses, participating
in the same activities outside of the classroom, or living near each other. Segregation across
friendship groups, courses, extracurricular activities, and residential location within colleges may
be just as important as - or even more important than - segregation across colleges.
Data for studying segregation across the entire country at a finer level than the college
level are limited, but I attempt to shed some light on the issue by measuring segregation in
earned degrees across all major × university combinations using data from the 2011 IPEDS
Completions survey. This data set provides university-level information on the number of
students of each race who received a bachelor’s degree by two-digit, four-digit, and six-digit
Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) major codes. To give an example of these major
codes, the six-digit code 450601 is “Economics, General,” the four-digit code 4506 combines

20

“Economics, General” with related categories like “Econometrics and Quantitative Economics”
and “International Economics,” and the two-digit code 45 combines the various economics
majors with majors in other social sciences such as political science and sociology.
This data set provides some information about the extent to which students are in the
same classroom with students of a different race and possibly about the extent to which members
of different racial groups are interacting with one another, but there are also several limitations to
using these data to study segregation at the college level. First, since not every college student
goes on to graduate, there are many students who attended college but are not included in the
data. Second, major choice is only one measure of interaction. Course selection within the
major, extracurricular activities, living groups, and friendship groups may be important as well.
But even though the data are not ideal and the evidence is admittedly limited, the results should
still be valid as measures of segregation across majors amongst college graduates.
The results using the within-college data are presented in Table 5. The first column
aggregates the major data up to the university level to examine segregation across colleges only
for those who graduated with a bachelor’s degree. The results in this column are somewhat
similar to those presented in Figures 2, 5, 8, and 11 for segregation across colleges for all
enrolled students in recent years. However, comparing the results in the first column of Table 5
to the earlier figures suggests that there is lower white exposure to blacks amongst bachelor’s
recipients than there is amongst all undergraduate students at four-year colleges, but there is less
segregation amongst bachelor’s recipients by the other measures. As the table moves across
columns, it measures segregation across smaller units. Students would presumably have more
interaction in the classroom with those at their university with whom they share the same sixdigit major code than they would with the average student at the university, and they would

21

presumably also have more interaction with those at their university with whom they share a
two-digit or four-digit major code than they would with those with whom they only share a sixdigit major code.
Interestingly, when moving across columns from the university level to eventually the
two-digit major level at the university, the results do not change a great deal. For example, 7.9%
of the graduates at the typical white graduate’s university are black, and 7.2% of the graduates at
the typical white graduate’s university sharing the same six-digit major code are black. This
suggests that, although there is segregation within colleges, much of the segregation observed in
higher education is segregation across colleges rather than segregation within colleges across
majors. The row giving results for the Theil index provides information required to show this
more formally in a decomposition of segregation across major × university combinations into a
cross-university component and a within-university component. For example, the Theil index of
34.3 across six-digit major × university combinations can be decomposed into the 25.0 shown in
the first column attributable to segregation across universities and the remaining 9.3 (34.3 –
25.0) attributable to segregation within universities. Segregation across four-digit and two-digit
major × university combinations can be decomposed in a similar way, and in each case the
across-university component is substantially larger than the within-university component.
Table 5 also shows decompositions of segregation into within- and between-state
components and within- and across-HBCU/TWI sector components. Consistent with the results
in Figures 13 and 16 for all students in recent years, the results in the first column show that most
segregation across colleges for college graduates in 2011 was attributable to the within-state
component and to the within-HBCU/TWI component. The other columns of Table 5 show that
the within-state component and the within-HBCU/TWI component are even larger when

22

studying major × university combinations, although this is true mechanically because the
“across” components are the same and the “within” component cannot fall when studying
segregation at a finer level.

VIII. Conclusion
The results of this paper suggest that, by several different measures, segregation at the
college level has declined over the years. Black-white dissimilarity and the Theil index have
fallen, whites have been increasingly exposed to blacks, and black exposure to whites is higher
than it was in 1970 even though it has fluctuated since then. The trend of blacks attending
HBCUs at a lower rate may be decreasing segregation, although on the other hand segregation is
rising within traditionally white institutions. Further, in three of four census regions, the index of
black exposure to whites, the black-white dissimilarity index, and the Theil index all point to
greater segregation over time. Additionally, based on the results of this paper, substantially
increasing the amount of interaction between blacks and whites in the classroom would seem to
necessitate students attending different colleges rather than changing students’ choices of field of
study within colleges. When viewed as a whole, the results of this paper may suggest some
successes but also some cause for concern for those who are concerned about racial segregation
in higher education.
This paper represents a step toward understanding racial segregation at the college level
by documenting how it has evolved over time and considering some channels through which
changes in segregation are occurring. A useful avenue for future research would be to estimate
the impact of higher education segregation on social networks, job networks, housing patterns,
educational outcomes, earnings, income inequality, and other outcomes. It may also be fruitful

23

to study the effects on segregation of other factors, such as college tuition policy. It is also worth
noting that policies and events that coincide with declining segregation, including falling
enrollment at HBCUs, may come along with other costs or benefits. Understanding these costs
and benefits would be useful as well. There are many difficult issues involved in making
policies related to issues of race in higher education; but the effects of policies on segregation
levels and other outcomes, as well as the effects of segregation, are factors that should be taken
into account when thinking about which policies to enact.
