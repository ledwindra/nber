    "abstract": "\n\nRepresentation of women and minorities in a \u201cselectorate\u201d\u2014the group that chooses an organization's leaders\u2014is a key mechanism for promoting diversity. We show that representation, on its own, is not sufficient for selecting gender diversity: a supportive organizational culture is also required. In the case of the Internet Engineering Task Force, a random increase in female representation in its selection committee caused an increase in female appointments only after cultural norms supporting diversity and inclusion became more salient.\n\n",
