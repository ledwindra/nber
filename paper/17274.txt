ABSTRACT
This study constructs a new data set on unemployment rates in Latin America and the Caribbean and
then explores the determinants of unemployment. We compare different countries, finding that unemployment
is influenced by the size of the rural population and that the effects of government regulations are generally
weak. We also examine large, persistent increases in unemployment over time, finding that they are
caused by contractions in aggregate demand. These demand contractions result from either disinflationary
monetary policy or the defense of an exchange-rate peg in the face of capital flight. Our evidence supports
hysteresis theories in which short-run changes in unemployment influence the natural rate.

1. Introduction
What determines the long-run level of unemployment, or natural rate? This
paper examines this question for countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.
We see three related reasons for studying unemployment in Latin America.
First, there is a lot of variation to be explained. For example, a quick glance at
data for the 2000s suggests that the natural rate is around 5% in Mexico, 10% in
Chile, and 15% in Argentina. In many countries, unemployment has changed
greatly over time. In Argentina, unemployment was about 5% in the 1980s.
Second, Latin American unemployment is understudied. Few economists have
made systematic efforts to explain the variation that we’ve noted. Heckman
and Pagés (2004) seek to explain unemployment with differences across
countries in government regulations, but they are mostly unsuccessful. The
scarcity of research on Latin American unemployment contrasts with the huge
literatures on unemployment in Europe and the United States.
Third, research on Latin America promises to shed light on unemployment
more generally. The U.S. and European data have been mined extensively, and
economists still disagree about the determinants of long-run unemployment.
Some argue that labor-market institutions are the key factor (e.g. Nickell, 1997),
some emphasize the interaction of institutions with a variety of macroeconomic
shocks, (e.g. Blanchard and Wolfers, 2000), and some argue that monetary
policy influences long-run unemployment through hysteresis mechanisms (e.g.
Ball, 2009). Latin America provides a fresh set of experiences that will help us
test these ideas.
A major reason that Latin American unemployment is understudied is lack of
data. Unemployment statistics are fragmentary, and there are big differences in
how unemployment is measured across countries and over time. Therefore, a
major part of our project involves data gathering. We examine two data sets,
one constructed by the Interamerican Development Bank and one that we have

1

put together ourselves. The two data sets are complementary: the first is more
consistent across countries, while the second provides longer time series within
countries. Section 2 of this paper describes these data.
Section 3 uses the IADB data to examine differences in unemployment across
countries. Our strongest result is that unemployment depends negatively on the
proportion of the population in rural areas. We find mixed evidence on whether
payroll taxes affect unemployment, and no effect of legal restrictions on hiring
and firing.
Section 4 uses the new data we have constructed to analyze changes in
unemployment over time. Our most important results concern large increases
in long-run unemployment, which we measure by smoothing annual
unemployment with the Hodrick-Prescott filter. We identify six episodes since
the 1970s in which a country’s long-run unemployment rate rose by more than
four percentage points. In every case, the cause was a deep recession produced
by a fall in aggregate demand. In some episodes, the underlying shock was a
tightening of monetary policy aimed at reducing inflation. In other episodes,
capital flight caused a severe recession because a country maintained a rigid
exchange-rate peg.
In

conventional

macroeconomics,

demand-driven

recessions

affect

unemployment in the short run but not in the long run. Thus, our interpretation
of increases in unemployment is at odds with conventional models. Our
evidence supports theories of hysteresis, in which short-run changes in
unemployment influence the evolution of the natural rate.
Section V concludes the paper, and an Appendix provides details about our
data.

2. Unemployment Data
We will examine two sets of unemployment data, one constructed by the
Interamerican Development Bank and one that we have put together ourselves.
The two data sets are complementary: the first is more consistent across
countries, while the second provides longer time series within countries. The
rest of this section describes these data.
A. The IADB Data
The IADB provides annual unemployment rates for 19 countries. The data start
in 1990 but are highly incomplete: for many countries, there are only a few
observations. There is no rhyme or reason to which years are available (e.g., for
Ecuador, we have data for 1994, 1995, 1998, 2006, and 2007; for Venezuela we
have data for 1991 through 2004). For most countries, the data include separate
unemployment rates for urban and rural areas as well as nationwide
unemployment.
The virtue of this data set is that the IADB has tried to adjust for differences
across countries in definitions of unemployment.

The data are sufficiently

standardized that we can plausibly use them for cross-country comparisons of
unemployment rates. In the IADB data, an individual is asked about a
“reference week” shortly before the survey and is considered unemployed if he
(i) Did not work or have a job during the reference week and (ii) Searched
actively during the reference week. Active search involves contact with
potential employers, interviewing for jobs, filling out applications or contacting
employment agencies.
A few differences in unemployment definitions remain in the IADB data. As
described in the Appendix, we have made simple adjustments to account for
these differences. Table A1 reports our final version of the IADB data.

3

B. A New Data Set
Our study also examines a data set for 19 countries that covers far more years
than the IADB data.

For a number of countries we have annual data on

unemployment back to the 1970s, with few missing observations. We have
pieced together these data from country-specific sources – central banks, labor
ministries and national statistical agencies – and international agencies such as
the ILO (International Labor Organization).
It is challenging to find consistent data.

There is great variation in how

unemployment is measured, both across countries and over time in a given
country. For example, some unemployment series cover a few cities and others
cover the whole country; the series cover varying age groups (e.g. 12+ or 14+);
and the definition of unemployment varies widely. Sometimes virtually
everyone without a job is counted as unemployed, sometimes you must have
searched for work within a certain period, and so on. Often, data sources have
footnotes saying that changes in methodology occurred in certain years but not
saying what the changes were.
It appears hopeless to derive long unemployment series that are comparable
across countries. As we’ve noted, the IADB’s efforts to construct comparable
data were successful only for scattered years since 1990. However, we have
constructed longer series that we believe are reasonably consistent within each
country. We can use these data to study the evolution of unemployment over
time.
To derive our data, we have gone country by country to figure out how
unemployment was measured in different periods. We have made judgments
about which changes in methodology are small enough to ignore, and how to
adjust for larger changes. In some cases we can splice different unemployment
series together using periods in which they overlap. When in doubt, we have
sought advice from people at the agencies that produce unemployment data.

4

The Appendix describes how we constructed unemployment data for each
country. To illustrate our strategy, we describe here how we dealt with breaks
in the data for two countries. In one case, we adjusted the data to produce a
consistent time series; in the other, we could not find an adjustment that we
trusted, so we discarded data.
Mexico. Our data come from a government agency, the National Institute of
Statistics and Geography. They cover three cities--Mexico City, Guadalajara
and Monterrey--and begin in 1973. For years before 1985, the National Institute
reports an aggregate unemployment rate for the three cities; starting in 1985,
they report separate rates for each city. For the later period, we measure
unemployment with a weighted average of the three city rates, where the
weights are based on population in 1990.
In 1984, the government also changed its definitions of employment and
unemployment. Two groups of people were moved from the category of
unemployed to employed: people waiting to start a job within 30 days, and
laid-off workers who expect to return to their jobs within 30 days. Also, unpaid
family workers who work less than 15 hours a week, who were previously
counted as unemployed, were dropped from the labor force. These changes
reduce the unemployment rate. Fortunately, unemployment for the three cities
was measured with both the old and new definitions in 1984. The
unemployment rate was 6.0% by the old definition and 5.7% by the new
definition. Therefore, to make pre-1985 unemployment rates comparable with
later data, we multiply them by the ratio 5.7/6.0.
Trinidad and Tobago: We use a consistent unemployment series from the
International Labor Organization that begins in 1987. Data are available before
1987, but with a different definition of unemployment: labor force entrants who
are seeking their first job are counted as unemployed starting in 1987 but not
before that. We have not found overlapping data with the two methodologies.
Data from other countries suggests that first-time job seekers are a large share
of the unemployed—sometimes more than a third. We don’t know how much
5

the unemployment rates for Trinidad and Tobago are affected by the exclusion
of first-time job seekers, so we discard the pre-1987 data.
We believe that the unemployment series we have constructed will be useful for
future research. These data, reported in Table A2, cover 19 countries with 571
country-year observations. The median country has 33 years of continuous
data. The longest series is Chile’s, which runs from 1957 through 2007. We end
the sample in 2007 for all countries; in this paper, we wish to sidestep the
question of how the financial crisis of 2008-2009 affected unemployment.

3. Cross Country Differences in Unemployment
Here we examine differences in unemployment across countries, seeking to
explain them with variables that capture the level of economic development
and institutions in the labor market. We use the IADB data on unemployment,
which are comparable across countries.
Measuring Long-Run Unemployment
We are interested in a country’s long-run level of unemployment, or natural
rate. One could estimate this variable by averaging unemployment rates for
years in which data are available. This approach may be misleading, however,
because the years in the IADB data set vary greatly from country to country.
Latin American unemployment is generally higher in some years than in others,
implying that the timing of data influences a country’s average unemployment.
This average is higher if the country’s data happen to come from highunemployment years.
In estimating long-run unemployment, we control for the timing of data. We
run an unbalanced panel regression of unemployment on dummy variables for
countries and years, using all country-year pairs in our sample. Our measure of
a country’s long-run unemployment is the coefficient on the country’s dummy

6

plus the average of all time effects. We can interpret this variable as an estimate
of average unemployment over the period spanned by the entire IADB data set
(1990-2007).
Table 1 shows our estimates of long run unemployment for each of the 19
countries in the IADB data. For comparison, it also shows simple averages of
the unemployment rates reported for each country, which do not control for
time effects. The long-run unemployment rates that we create differ from
simple averages by moderate amounts (sometimes one or two percentage
points).
The data reveal great heterogeneity in Latin American unemployment rates.
Long-run unemployment ranges from 1.2% in Guatemala to 12.9% in
Argentina. The mean across countries is 6.0% and the standard deviation is
3.0%. This variation presents an opportunity for us to take a fresh look at the
debate about unemployment. What could explain such differences across
countries?
Candidate Explanations
We examine two sets of variables that might influence unemployment:
measures of economic development and measures of labor-market distortions
caused by government policy. Labor market policies are a focus of research on
unemployment in advanced economies (e.g. Siebert, 1997; Nickell, 1997).
Development levels are natural to examine in our context because they vary
greatly across LAC countries; in 2000, for example, real GDP per capita ranged
from US$ 2126 in Nicaragua to US$ 12095 in Mexico.
Here we briefly describe the variables that we examine. The Appendix gives
further details on how the variables are constructed.
Development Variables: We examine four variables in this category:


Real GDP per capita

7



Educational attainment of the population, as measured by Barro and Lee
(2001)



Agricultural output as a percentage of GDP



Rural population as a percentage of total population

Labor-Market Variables: Research on advanced-economy unemployment
emphasizes distortions caused by government policies. Data on labor-market
policies are relatively scarce in Latin America, but we have found two sources
that provide measures of distortions. One is Heckman and Pagés’s (2004)
extensive study of Latin American labor markets; the other is Doing Business, a
periodic publication of the World Bank.
We examine four variables that measure constraints on employment flexibility,
two from the Heckman-Pagés data (HP) and two from Doing Business (DB).
Brief definitions of these variables follow (see Appendix for details):


Advance notice: the number of months’ notice that an employee must be
given before being fired (HP)



Indemnities for dismissal: The cost to employers of mandatory payments
to workers who are fired (HP)



Firing costs (DB): A measure of the total cost of advance notice
requirements and payments for dismissal



Rigidity of employment (DB): A broad index of restrictions on employers
in hiring, firing, and adjusting workers’ hours

We also examine two variables that measure taxes paid by employers, one
from each data set:


Social security contributions (HP): the cost of required employer
contributions to social security programs including retirement funds,
disability insurance, and unemployment insurance
8



Labor taxes (DB): the cost of “all charges levied on labor,” including social
security contributions, for a mid-size firm.

Cross-Country Regressions
Here we examine the explanatory power of our candidate variables for crosscountry differences in unemployment. Overall we have ten candidate variables.
With only 19 countries in the sample, we restrict attention to specifications with
a small number of variables. We start with simple regressions of long-run
unemployment on a single variable, then use these results to motivate multiple
regressions. We first consider development variables, then labor-market
variables, then combinations of the two.
Table 2 examines the four development variables. The first four columns show
simple regressions of unemployment on each variable. Two have significant
coefficients: GDP per capita, with a positive coefficient, and rural population,
with a negative coefficient. Each of these results means that greater economic
development--higher

GDP

or

lower

rural

population—implies

higher

unemployment.
GDP per capita and rural population have a correlation of –0.80 (higher-income
countries are less rural). To separate the effects of these variables, we regress
unemployment on both of them, as shown in the last column of Table 2. In this
specification, only rural population remains significant, suggesting that it is the
primary development variable that influences unemployment. The first panel of
Figure 1 shows a scatterplot of unemployment against rural population.
Table 3 presents simple regressions of long run unemployment on labor market
variables. Of the six variables we consider, only one, social security
contributions from the Heckman-Pagés data, is significant. Higher social
security contributions (SSC) imply higher unemployment. The second panel of
Figure 1 shows this relationship in a scatterplot.

9

Table 4 presents our final specification. Motivated by the previous tables, we
regress unemployment on rural population and SSC. Here, rural population is
significant and the significance of SSC is borderline (p=0.09). The adjusted Rsquared is 0.60. We have checked that any third variable is insignificant when
we control for rural population and SSC.
Discussion
Both the effect of rural population on unemployment and the effect of SSC have
straightforward interpretations. Development economists have long recognized
that unemployment is generally lower in rural areas than in urban areas (e.g.
Squire, 1981). This fact is confirmed by the IADB data, which, for 17 countries,
include urban and rural unemployment rates as well as total unemployment.
When we compute long run unemployment rates for each country (again
removing time effects), the averages of these rates across countries are 6.3% for
urban unemployment and 3.2% for rural unemployment. Thus it is natural that
total unemployment is lower in more rural countries.1
A number of factors may contribute to the difference between urban and rural
unemployment. One is the Harris-Todaro (1970) effect: workers crowd into
urban areas to seek scarce but high-paying jobs. Other possible factors include
greater self-employment and larger informal sectors in rural areas; less
unionization and weaker enforcement of minimum wages (Rosenzweig, 1987;
Bernal, 2009); and more efficient matching of workers and jobs in small
communities.
The effects of social security contributions are stressed by some students of
European unemployment (e.g. Siebert, 1997). They argue that the costs to
employers create a “tax wedge” that reduces labor demand and increases

1

Under this interpretation, a country’s rural population affects the weights on rural and urban
unemployment in aggregate unemployment. In theory, rural population could also affect the
underlying rural and urban unemployment rates. However, when we regress either urban
unemployment or rural unemployment on rural population and SSC, rural population is
insignificant.

10

unemployment. Our regressions provide some evidence for this effect in Latin
America.
There is reason, however, to question the robustness of this result. Recall that
one of our labor-market variables is “labor tax” from the Doing Business data
set. This variable and SSC appear to be similar measures of tax wedges,
although, as described in the Appendix, there are differences in details (for
example, the Doing Business variable includes only taxes with statutory
incidence on employers, while SSC includes contributions by workers). One
might expect the two variables to be strongly correlated, but in fact the
correlation across countries is only 0.30. As shown in Table 3, the effect of labor
tax on unemployment is insignificant. Future work should further explore these
results and seek to determine the best measure of tax wedges.
Comparison to Heckman and Pagés
This study builds on Heckman and Pagés (2004), who construct some of the
labor-market variables that we examine. Heckman and Pagés find that labormarket variables have significant effects on unemployment in advanced
economies (mainly in Europe). However, when they restrict their sample to
Latin American countries, none of the variables is significant—including social
security contributions, which is significant in our regressions (see HeckmanPagés Table 8B).
There appears to be a simple explanation for this difference in results. Heckman
and Pagés estimate the effects of labor-market variables in panel data, with
country fixed effects. Thus, unlike us, they do not exploit the cross-country
variation in their data; instead, their results are based on variation over time. In
most countries, labor-market variables such as SSC do not change greatly over
time, so it is not surprising that Heckman and Pagés’s results are weak.

11

4. Time Series Evidence
We now turn from cross country comparisons to examine changes in
unemployment over time.

Following the strategy in Ball (2009), we first

identify episodes of large rises and falls in trend unemployment. Then we
examine each episode to see why unemployment changed.
Identifying Large Changes in the Natural Rate
Here we use the annual time series for unemployment that we have constructed
for each country in our sample (Table A2). These series may not be comparable
across countries, but we have sought to make them consistent over time in a
given country. Therefore, we can use these data to measure changes in a
country’s unemployment rate.
We are interested in changes in a country’s long-run or natural rate of
unemployment, not in cyclical fluctuations. We estimate the natural rate by
smoothing the unemployment series with the Hodrick-Prescott filter, with a
smoothing parameter of 100.

In the analysis that follows, U is the actual

unemployment rate and U* is our estimate of the natural rate.2
Using our series for U*, we identify episodes of “large” changes in the natural
rate. After some experimentation, we define such an episode as a period in
which U* rises or falls monotonically and the total change from start to finish is
greater than four percentage points in absolute value. An episode starts at
either a local minimum of a country’s U* series, a local maximum, or the first
year for which we have data for the country; the episode ends at the next local
minimum or maximum or the last year of data.
We believe that, by focusing on large changes in U*, we pick out episodes of
true, substantial changes in long-run unemployment. Smaller changes in U*
2

Many researchers treat the natural rate of unemployment as a time-varying parameter in a
Phillips curve and estimate its path using data on inflation as well as unemployment (e.g.
Staiger et al., 1997; Ball and Mankiw, 2002). This approach is not appropriate for Latin
American countries, because episodes of very high inflation make the assumption of a stable
Phillips curve untenable.

12

might reflect measurement error or cyclical movements in unemployment that
our simple detrending has not removed.
For the 19 countries in our sample, our four-percentage-point criterion yields a
total of 11 episodes of large unemployment changes—six increases and five
decreases. For each episode, Table 5 lists the country, the time period, and the
levels of U* at the start and end. Figure 2 shows the series for U and U* for all
countries in which an episode occurred, with episodes shaded in light gray. The
Figure also shows annual data on output growth, inflation, and the real
exchange rate against the U.S. dollar (increases in the variable are appreciations
of the local currency); we use these data to help interpret the episodes.3
A number of episodes include a sub-period when U* changed rapidly,
accounting for most of the total change. In the rest of the episode, U* changed in
the same direction, but not by much. In seeking explanations for the change in
U*, we focus on what happened around the “core” period of rapid change.
Specifically, we define the core as the period when U* changed by at least 0.5
percentage points each year. In Figure 2, the core of each episode is shaded in
dark gray.
Chile, for example, experienced an episode of rising U* that lasted 18 years,
from 1965 to 1983. U* rose a total of 10.1 percentage points (from 5.7% to 15.8%).
The core of Chile’s episode covers ten years, from 1971 to 1980, which account
for 8.2 percentage points of the rise in U*.
Across the eleven cases in Table 5, the length of an episode ranges from 7 to 26
years. The core period ranges from 3 to 11 years, except for 20 years in Trinidad
and Tobago. Each episode has one core, except for Jamaica’s, which has two.
In the rest of this section, we seek to explain the large changes in U* that we
have identified. For comparison, we also examine episodes in which actual
unemployment, U, fluctuated sharply but U* did not change significantly.

Inflation, output and exchange rates are taken from the WDI and the IFS.

Explaining Increases in U*
What causes increases in long run unemployment? When we examine the six
cases in Table 5 and Figure 2, we quickly see that they have something in
common: in each case, the core of the episode occurred around the time of a
severe contraction in aggregate demand. The demand contraction caused a
large increase in unemployment, U. The fact that U* also rose substantially
suggests some hysteresis mechanism through which a demand-driven increase
in unemployment affects the natural rate. This story is similar to Ball’s (2009)
interpretation of natural-rate increases in European countries in the 1980s and
90s.
What caused the demand contractions behind the increases in unemployment?
There are two different answers, each of which is the primary explanation for
three of our six episodes. In Chile, Colombia, and Venezuela, the cause was a
severe tightening of monetary policy motivated by the central bank’s desire to
reduce inflation. In Argentina, Paraguay, and Panama, the cause was a
combination of capital flight and a nonaccommodative policy response: the
exchange rate was not allowed to fall, or could not fall because of dollarization.
To flesh out these stories, we briefly examine each of the six episodes, focusing
on the core period of rapidly rising unemployment. Our analysis is based on the
macroeconomic data in Figure 2 and on historical accounts of the episodes in
sources such as the United Nation’s annual Economic Survey of Latin America.
We first consider the three cases of disinflation and then the three cases of
capital flight.
Chile (core period 1971-1980): This episode resulted from an extreme shift in
macroeconomic policy. The inflation rate rose to 500% under the Socialist
government of Salvadore Allende. Then, in 1973, the Pinochet regime
overthrew Allende and tightened fiscal and monetary policy severely to reduce
inflation. The inflation rate fell steadily, to a low of 10% in 1982. The
unemployment rate shot up from 3% in 1973 to 18% in 1976, then stayed in
14

double digits for the rest of the 1970s; this experience pulled up the estimated
natural rate, U*.4
Colombia (1994-2001) In the 1970s and 80s, Colombia’s inflation rate fluctuated
between 15% and 30%. In 1991, a new Constitution made price stability the
primary goal of the central bank. Policymakers slowed the growth of monetary
aggregates, producing high real interest rates and a 46% real appreciation over
1991-98. Inflation fell to single digits in 2000 and unemployment experienced a
long rise, from 8% in 1994 to 22% in 2002. (Capital flight sparked by the 1998
Russian crisis contributed to the last part of this increase.)
Venezuela (1996-1999) In 1996, with inflation running at 100%, Venezuela
adopted an IMF stabilization program, the Agenda de Venezuela. As part of
this program, the central bank adopted a crawling peg for the exchange rate
that kept the rate of depreciation below the inflation rate. The real exchange rate
rose by 68% over 1996-2001 and real interest rates peaked near 30% in 1998.
Inflation fell to 13% in 2001, while unemployment rose from 7% to 18% over the
decade from 1993 to 2003.
We now turn to the three episodes of large unemployment increases that were
triggered by capital flight. In each case, the exchange rate was rigid. When
unemployment rose, it stayed high because the economy lacked the “shock
absorber” of depreciation.
Argentina (1987-1997) Argentina experienced capital flight in the 1990s,
resulting first from the Mexican crisis of 1994 and then from its own rising debt
and loss of confidence in its currency board. After the currency board fixed the
nominal exchange rate 1991, Argentine inflation exceeded U.S. inflation for
several years, causing a real appreciation of 60%. The combination of
overvaluation and worsening capital flight pushed unemployment from 6% in
1991 to 18% ten years later, on the eve of the currency board’s collapse.
4

Because our series for U* smooths the data on unemployment, U* can start rising before an
event that raises unemployment. Chile is an example: the core of the U* increase begins in 1971
while actual unemployment starts rising in 1973.

15

Panama (1982-1988) The core of this episode is the period of the Latin American
debt crisis, which caused capital flight and raised unemployment across the
region. Panama had no exchange rate to adjust because its currency is the U.S.
dollar. In 1989 Panama experienced another shock, the U.S. invasion that
overthrew Noriega, which caused further capital flight and helped keep
unemployment high.
Paraguay (1997-1999) In Paraguay, capital flight was caused by a series of
shocks: the crises in Mexico in 1994, Russia in 1998, and Argentina in 2000-2001.
Paraguay did not have a hard peg, but policymakers chose to defend the
exchange rate during much of the episode. The real exchange rate rose slightly
from 1993 to 1998, but started to fall in 1999. Part of the increase in
unemployment was reversed after 2002, and the increase in U* was smaller than
those in Panama and Argentina (4.2 percentage points, compared to 8.3 points
and 12.6 points).
Temporary Unemployment Increases
We have examined episodes in which unemployment rose and stayed high,
producing a rise in our estimated natural rate U*. To get another perspective on
these experiences, we compare them to episodes in which unemployment rose
but then fell quickly, so U* did not rise significantly. What accounts for this
different pattern?
Specifically, we examine episodes in which unemployment rose by at least five
percentage points but U* rose by less than one point. Three such episodes exist:
one in Colombia, from 1981 to 1983, and two in Uruguay, from 1981 to 1983 and
from 1998 to 2002. Figure 3 shows U and U* in Colombia and Uruguay, with
shading on the periods of temporary unemployment increases. (Here we ignore
Colombia’s persistent unemployment increase in the 1990s.) In the three
episodes, U rises by amounts ranging from 5.9 to 8.8 percentage points, but the
accompanying increases in U* are very small (from 0.3 to 0.9 percentage points).

16

What happened during these episodes? In all three cases, the rise in
unemployment was caused by capital flight, which was triggered by the Latin
American debt crisis in the 1980s and by contagion from Argentina in
Uruguay’s second episode. Thus the temporary unemployment increases had
the same basic cause as some of the U* increases discussed above. The behavior
of the exchange rate, however, was very different. In contrast to exchange-rate
rigidity in Argentina, Panama, and Paraguay, the real exchange rate fell sharply
during the temporary unemployment increases. Over 1981-86, the real
exchange rate fell by 40% in Colombia and 50% in Uruguay; over 1998-2003 in
Uruguay, it fell by 48%.
These experiences bolster our interpretation of the U* increases in Argentina,
Panama, and Paraguay. Capital flight consistently causes an increase in
unemployment, but the persistence of this increase depends on exchange rate
policy. In flexible regimes, a sharp depreciation pushes unemployment back
down. When the exchange rate is rigid, unemployment remains high and U*
rises.
Explaining Decreases in U*
Finally, we examine the five episodes of large U* decreases (a fall of four
percentage points or more) shown in Table 5 and Figure 2. What explains these
experiences?
The five episodes have two features in common. First, each began with a high
level of U*, ranging from 14.7% to 25.5%. These starting points were legacies of
economic slumps that had previously raised U*. Evidently, it is possible for a
rise in U* to be reversed eventually; on the other hand, there are no cases of
large U* decreases starting from a moderate initial level.
Second, in all five cases, the fall in unemployment occurred during a period
when economic growth accelerated. In this respect, these cases are similar to the
experiences

of

some

European

economies.

Rapid

growth

reduced

unemployment, for example, in the U.K. in the late 1980s and Ireland in the
1990s (Ball, 1999).
Beyond these broad features, the five episodes of U* decreases are
heterogeneous. An increase in growth was spurred by a variety of factors,
including shifts in monetary policy, changes in commodity prices, and in one
case a rise in productivity growth. We briefly review why output growth
increased in each case.
Argentina (core period 2003-2007): We saw that U* rose in Argentina in the
1990s as the country maintained its currency peg in the face of capital flight. A
dramatic regime shift occurred when the currency board collapsed at the
beginning of 2002. The real exchange rate fell by 70%, spurring exports, and
output grew at an average annual rate of 9% from 2003 through 2007. The
unemployment rate U fell from 20% to 7%, dragging down U*.
Panama (2003-2007): After rising during the 1980s, Panama’s unemployment
stayed high during the 1990s. But the 2000s brought an economic boom: over
2003-2007, output growth averaged 7.9% and unemployment fell rapidly.
Causes of the rapid growth included expansionary fiscal policy and an
investment boom in anticipation of expansion of the Panama Canal. Strong
aggregate demand was reflected in the inflation rate, which rose from 0.4% to
4.2% over 2003-2007 despite Panama’s dollarization.
Chile (1985-1992): Average output growth during the core of this episode was
7.6%. An unusual feature of the Chilean boom is that the primary cause appears
to be an acceleration of productivity growth, perhaps due to liberalization of
the economy, rather than a surge in demand. The inflation rate fell over much
of the period when unemployment was falling. Ball and Moffitt (2002) argue
that the productivity acceleration reduced the natural rate of unemployment
because workers’ wage aspirations did not rise as rapidly as productivity.

18

Trinidad and Tobago (1988-2007): Output in Trinidad and Tobago fell by 28%
from 1982 to 1989, a result of disinflationary monetary policy and then low oil
prices. (Oil and gas account for 40% of the country’s GDP). The slump pushed
unemployment to 22% in 1987, the first year for which we have data. Then oil
prices recovered, monetary policy eased, and annual output growth averaged
5.1% from 1990 through 2007. Strong growth pulled the unemployment rate
down steadily.
Jamaica (1984-1992, 2001-2007): In Jamaica, output fell 23.5% from 1972 to 1980;
the diverse causes included political instability, drought, and an overvalued
exchange rate. Unemployment reached 28% in 1982. Then stability improved,
policymakers allowed the exchange rate to fall, and growth averaged 2.9% from
1981 through 2007. The result was a U*-decrease episode that lasted 26 years
(including two separate cores when U* fell by more than 0.5 points per year.)

5. Conclusion
This paper constructs a new data set on unemployment rates in Latin America
and the Caribbean, and then explores the determinants of unemployment.
Cross-country differences are explained partly by the size of the rural
population, and there is some evidence that tax wedges also matter. Within a
country, large increases in unemployment are caused by contractions in
aggregate demand, resulting from either disinflationary monetary policy or a
combination of capital flight and a rigid exchange rate. Decreases in
unemployment occur when unemployment starts very high and economic
growth accelerates.
Our results about unemployment increases echo research on other parts of the
world. Ball (1999) finds that disinflations explain increases in European
unemployment in the 1980s and 1990s. Ball (2010) finds that capital flight and

19

exchange rate rigidity caused severe slumps in Hong Kong and the Baltic
countries as well as Latin America.
Our results conflict with conventional macroeconomics, in which shifts in
aggregate demand affect unemployment only in the short run. We find that
demand contractions can have long run effects: unemployment often remains
high for a decade or more. These findings suggest the presence of hysteresis in
unemployment.
Our understanding of hysteresis mechanisms is hazy. A common story is that
unemployed workers become detached from the labor force, turning a shortrun rise in unemployment into a long-run rise. However, there is little direct
evidence on the strength of this effect. Understanding hysteresis should be a
priority for research.
In one way, our results do not support common stories about hysteresis. Many
discussions of Europe emphasize the role of unemployment insurance: it is
easier to become detached from the labor force if one can live on the dole
indefinitely. Yet this paper finds strong hysteresis effects in Latin America,
where unemployment insurance is much less common and generous than in
Europe. Our findings suggest that unemployment insurance is not essential for
hysteresis.

Data Appendix
A. Cross-country comparable unemployment rates from the IADB
The unemployment data from the Interamerican Development Bank are based
on household surveys in each country in its sample. The IADB seeks to produce
harmonized statistics that are as comparable as possible across countries and
over time. The data are described in IADB (2004).
Unemployment Definition: The IADB measures unemployment as the number
of unemployed divided by the labor force (employed plus unemployed). For
most countries, an individual’s status is determined by his situation during a
“reference week.” He is counted as unemployed if he was not employed and
did not search actively for work during the reference week. Active search
includes activities such as contacting potential employers or employment
agencies, interviewing for jobs, or filling out applications. The labor force is
restricted to ages 15 through 64.
In Colombia and Mexico, the reference period is one month rather than one
week; in Chile, it is two months. A longer reference period increases the
unemployment

rate.

Brazil’s

monthly

employment

survey

reports

unemployment rates based on one-week and one-month reference periods in
June and July, 2002; the unemployment rate based on one week is 0.92 times the
rate based on one month. Based on this example, we multiply all
unemployment rates in Colombia, Mexico, and Chile by 0.92 to make them
comparable with other countries. IADB staff have told us that this adjustment is
reasonable.
Our adjusted version of the IADB data are presented in Table A1.

B. New Data Set of Unemployment Rates
To derive our data, we have gone country by country to figure out how
unemployment was measured in different periods. We have made judgments
about which changes in methodology are small enough to ignore, and how to
adjust for larger changes. In some cases we can splice different unemployment
series together using periods in which they overlap. When in doubt, we have
sought advice from people at the agencies that produce unemployment data.
We have pieced together data from country-specific sources –central banks,
labor ministries and national statistical agencies– and international agencies
such as the International Labor Organization. Where a methodological change
appears significant but we cannot reliably estimate its effects, we discard the
shortest portion of the data that yields a consistent series
Here we report the sources of data, the definition of unemployment, and our
adjustments to the series for each country. Table A2 reports the data.
Argentina. Sources:

ILO (International Labor Organization) and INDEC

(National Institute of Statistics and Census). Surveys cover Gran Buenos Aires
and include people ages 10+. Definition: No job and searched actively during
the reference week. Prior to 2003, unemployment rates are averages based on
surveys in May and October. In 2003, several methodological changes were
introduced: the frequency of surveys was increased to one per quarter; some
types of female labor that had previously been ignored were included in
employment; and the definition of job search of the unemployed was
broadened. At one point in time, the INDEC reports results for both versions of
the surveys: it reports the new series for the second quarter of 2003 and the old
series for May 2003. The ratio of the unemployment rates in the new and old
data is 1.14. Therefore, to correct for the break in the series in 03, for 03-07, we
average outcomes for the second and fourth quarter and divide the figure by
1.14.
Bolivia. Sources: ILO and INE (National Institute of Statistics). The age covered
by the surveys is 10+, while the geographical coverage is “main towns” prior to
35

1996 and urban areas thereafter. After analyzing the data, we decided that the
change in geographical coverage was small enough to ignore. Definition: No job
and searched actively during the reference week. The unemployment rate for
1998 is missing; in Table A2, we impute this number by averaging the
unemployment rates in 1997 and 1999.
Brazil. Source: IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), PME
(Monthly Employment Survey). The surveys cover people 15+. Geographical
coverage: Metropolitan regions of Recife, Salvador, Belo Horizonte, Rio de
Janeiro, São Paulo and Porto Alegre. The figures we report are averages of
monthly rates. Definition before 2003: No job and searched actively during the
reference week. In 2003, a number of methodological changes were introduced,
including new definitions of the geographical areas covered by the survey and
an extension of the reference period for search to 30 days. The IBGE performed
both versions of the survey from March through December 2002; the average
ratio of unemployment rates is 1.47. Therefore, we divide the unemployment
rates for 2003 and later by 1.47 to make them comparable to the older data.
Chile. Source: Encuesta de ocupación y desocupación, Universidad de Chile.
The survey covers Gran Santiago and is performed in June of each year. Ages
14+. Definition: No job and searched actively during the reference week. There
are no breaks in the original series.
Colombia. Sources: ILO and DANE (Administrative National Department of
Statistics). We use the survey from September of each year. Ages 12+.
Geographical

coverage

includes

seven

cities:

Bogota,

Medellin,

Cali,

Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Pasto and Manizales. The weights on the cities
changed in 1991; we ignore this change. Definition before 2001: No job and
searched actively during the last year (thus, includes “hidden unemployment”
or “discouraged workers” who would not be counted as unemployed in many
countries). In 2001, there were several methodological changes including a
redefinition of unemployment to require search during a reference week. Both
versions of the unemployment rate were reported in 2000; the ratio of the old
36

and new rates is 1.19. Therefore, we multiply unemployment rates in 2001 and
later by 1.19. In 2006, new methodological changes were made; nevertheless,
CEI (an independent commission of experts, 2008) concluded that the impact of
the changes on the urban unemployment rate is statistically insignificant. Thus,
we ignore the break.
Costa Rica. Sources: ILO and INEC (National Institute of Statistics and Census).
National survey in July of each year. Ages 12+. Definition before 1987: No job
and looked for one during the reference week or did not look for a job during
the reference week for “circumstantial reasons” but looked for one “in the
past”. Starting in 1987, “In the past” is restricted to 5 weeks. This
methodological change is similar to the narrowing of the unemployment
definition in Colombia and Panama. Based on these countries, we estimate that
the old definition raises unemployment rates by a factor of 1.1. Therefore, we
divide the pre-87 data by 1.1.
Dominican Republic. Source: Labor Force National Survey, Central Bank of the
Dominican Republic. National rates, ages 10+. Definition: Includes hidden
unemployment, that is, no job search required to be counted as unemployed.
Ecuador. Source: ILO. Survey in November (except July in 1993 and 2001,
December in 2007). Ages: 12+ until 1990, 10+ thereafter; we ignore this change.
Geographic coverage is urban areas of Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca.
Definition: No job and active search during a reference period of five weeks.
El Salvador. Source: ILO. In the original data, unemployment rates are national
except for 1988-1992, when they are urban. IADB data suggest that urban rates
are 1.1 times national rates. Therefore, we divide the unemployment rates for
1988-92 by 1.1. Ages 10+. Definition: no job and have actively searched for a job
(reference period is not explicit).
Guatemala. Source: ILO. National rates, ages 10+. Definition: No job during
reference week and searched actively during the 4 preceding weeks.

37

Honduras. Source: INE (National Institute of Statistics). Survey of urban areas
in September (except March in 1993 and 2001). Ages 10+. Definition: No job in
the reference week and searched actively during the reference week.
Unemployment rate for 2000 is missing; in Table A2 we impute this number by
averaging the unemployment rates in 1999 and 2001.
Jamaica. Sources: ILO. National rates. Definition: “The unemployed comprise
all those aged 14 years and over who were looking for work, wanting work and
available for work. Persons looking for work must have made a positive
attempt to seek a job such as: registration at employment agency; visiting job
sites in search of a job; applying in person to prospective employers; putting
advertisements in any public press or place; writing letters of application;
asking someone to try to find a job; making investigations with a view of
starting own farm or business.”
Mexico. Sources: ECSO (Continuous Survey on Occupation), 1973-1984, and
ENEU (National Employment Urban Survey), 1985-2004. The ECSO data cover
three cities: Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey. ENEU provides
unemployment rates for individual cities; we construct a weighted average for
the three cities using population estimates from the 1990 census. Ages 12+.
Definition: No job and searched actively during the reference week. Before
1985, the unemployed include persons waiting to start a job in 30 days; persons
who expect to return to a previous job within 30 days; and unpaid family
workers working less than 15 hours per week. Starting in 1985, the first two
groups are counted as employed and the third is out of the labor force. Both
versions of the unemployment rate are reported for 1984; the ratio of the old
definition to the new one is 1.05. Therefore, we divide the data before 1985 by
1.05.
Panama. Sources: UN Yearbook of Labour Statistics (1963-69), ILO (1970-99),
Contraloría de Panamá (2000-). National rates, ages 15+. Definition: includes
hidden unemployment. The unemployment rate is missing for 1980-81 and
1990. In Table A2, we use the 1979 rate for 1980-1981. (We did not use the 1982
38

rate because of the likely effect of the Latin American debt crisis.) We impute a
rate for 1990 by averaging the rates for 1989 and 1991.
Paraguay.

Sources: ILO (1979-96), LAC Statistical Yearbook (1997-).

Geographical coverage is Asunción Metro area until 1994 and urban areas
thereafter. Ages 12+ for 1979-1992 and 1994; otherwise, 10+. We ignore these
changes. Definition: No job in reference week and searched actively during
reference week. The unemployment rate for 1981 is missing; we use the average
of 1980 and 1982.
Peru. Sources: MTPS (Ministry of Labor and Social Promotion), 1970-94; INEI
(National Institute of Statistics), 1995-. Unemployment rates for Lima, ages 14+.
Definition: No job in reference week and searched actively during reference
week. Missing data for 1978, 1985, and 1988 are imputed by averaging adjacent
years.
Trinidad and Tobago. Sources: Yearbook of Labour Statistics and ILO. National
survey, ages 15+. Definition

: includes hidden unemployment. (We have

discarded data before 1987, which do not count first-time job seekers as
unemployed, because we do not know how large an adjustment to make to
these data.)
Uruguay. Sources: Yearbook of Labour Statistics and INE (National Institute of
Statistics). Unemployment rates for Montevideo, ages 14+. Definition: No job
during reference week and searched actively during reference week. Starting in
1981, domestic workers are not counted as employed; this change appears small
enough to ignore. The unemployment rate in 1975 is missing; we impute it by
averaging 1974 and 1976.
Venezuela. Sources: ILO and INE (National Institute of Statistics). National
rates, ages 15+. We calculate annual unemployment rates as averages of rates
for the first and second halves of each year. Definition: Includes hidden
unemployment.

C. Other Variables
This appendix describes the data used in the cross-country regressions.
Development related variables:
•

Per capita GDP, [PPP constant 2000 international US$]: average per capita
GDP from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) between
1990 and 2007.

•

Education: This is a measure proposed by Barro and Lee (2000) as a proxy
for economic development. It is based on the educational attainment of the
population ages 25+, measured as no schooling, primary, secondary, and
higher. We took the average value for years 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005.

•

Value added of the agricultural sector as a percentage of GDP: we take the
simple average between 1990 and 2007. Data come from the WDI.

•

Rural population as a percentage of total population: we take the simple
average between 1990 and 2007. Data come from the WDI.

Labor Market Rigidities: (Based on descriptions provided by Heckman and
Pages (HP) and Doing Business (DB).)
For the HP data, available years vary widely across countries. In each country,
the three HP variables are available for the same years. The only exception is
Guatemala, where only data on social security contributions (SSC) are available.
We exclude Guatemala from regressions that include other labor-market
variables. The following table shows available years for each country. For the
regressions, we compute the simple average of each country’s available
numbers:

Definitions:
•

Advance Notice (HP): indicates the number of months with which an
employee has to be notified if he is to be fired.

•

Indemnities for Dismissal (HP):

Cost of mandatory indemnities for

dismissal, reported in multiples of monthly wages.
•

Social Security Contributions (HP): expected discounted cost of complying
with social security laws, in multiples of monthly wages. This cost includes
“contributions by employers and employees to old age, disability and death;
sickness and maternity; work injury; unemployment insurance and Family
allowances programs”.

For a few years the World Bank generated and reported data on labor market
regulations as part of the Doing Business (DB) program. Unfortunately, that
part of the dataset was later discontinued. We use some of labor market data
once produced by DB. For two of the DB variables used in the paper—Rigidity
of Employment and Firing Costs—we have figures for 2003-2006 (except for
Trinidad and Tobago, where the information started in 2005). The labor tax
variable is only available for 2006. For the regressions, we average the available
numbers for each country.

Definitions:
•

Rigidity of Employment Index (DB): This variable is the average of three
other indexes: a difficulty of hiring index, a rigidity of hours index and a
difficulty of redundancy index. They all take values between 0 and 100, with
higher values indicating more rigidity. The difficulty of hiring index
measures “(i) whether fixed-term contracts are prohibited for permanent
tasks; (ii) the maximum cumulative duration of fixed term contracts; and (iii)
the ratio of the minimum wage for a trainee or first-time employee to the
average value added per worker”. The rigidity of hours index “has 5
components: (i) whether there are restrictions on night work; (ii) whether
there are restrictions on weekly holiday work;(iii) whether the workweek
can consist of 5.5 days; (iv) whether the workweek can extend to 50 hours or
more (including overtime) for 2 months a year to respond to a seasonal
increase in production; and (v) whether paid annual vacation is 21 working
days or fewer”. The difficulty of redundancy index has 8 components: “(i)
whether redundancy is disallowed as a basis for terminating workers; (ii)
whether the employer needs to notify a third party (such as a government
agency) to terminate 1 redundant worker; (iii) whether the employer needs
to notify a third party to terminate a group of 9 redundant workers; (iv)
whether the employer needs approval from a third party to terminate 1
redundant worker; (v) whether the employer needs approval from a third
party to terminate a group of 9 redundant workers; (vi) whether the law
requires the employer to reassign or retrain a worker before making the
worker redundant; (vii) whether priority rules apply for redundancies; and
(viii) whether priority rules apply for reemployment”.

•

Firing Costs (DB): This variable measures the cost of advance notice
requirements, severance payments and penalties due when terminating a
redundant worker, expressed in weekly wages.

•

Labor Tax (DB): This variable is the sum of all labor-related taxes payable
by a medium size business, including payroll taxes, mandatory social
43

security

contributions,

mandatory

health

insurance,

mandatory

unemployment insurance, and any local contributions that depend on the
payroll or number of employees. Only taxes with statutory incidence on the
employer are included. (For more detail on this variable, see Djankov et al.,
2009).
