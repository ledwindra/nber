    "abstract": "\n\nCommodity prices are back.  This paper looks at connections between monetary policy, and agricultural and mineral commodities.  We begin with the monetary influences on commodity prices, first for a large country such as the United States, then smaller countries.  The claim is that low real interest rates lead to high real commodity prices.  The theory is an analogy with Dornbusch overshooting.  The relationship between real interest rates and real commodity prices is also supported empirically.  One channel through which this effect is accomplished is a negative effect of interest rates on the desire to carry commodity inventories.  The paper concludes with a consideration of implications for monetary policy.\n\n",
