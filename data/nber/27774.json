    "abstract": "\n\nPatterns of state formation have crucial implications for comparative economic development. Diamond (1997) famously argued that \u201cfractured land\u201d was responsible for China\u2019s tendency toward political unification and Europe\u2019s protracted polycentrism. We build a dynamic model with granular geographical information in terms of topographical features and the location of productive agricultural land to quantitatively gauge the effects of fractured land on state formation in Eurasia. We find that topography alone is sufficient, but not necessary, to explain polycentrism in Europe and unification in China. Differences in land productivity, in particular the existence of a core region of high land productivity in northern China, also deliver the same result. We discuss how our results map into observed historical outcomes, assess how robust our findings are, and analyze the predictions of our model for Africa and the Americas.\n\n",
