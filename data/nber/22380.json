    "abstract": "\n\nWe have a world of conjoined monetary and macroprudential policies. But can they function smoothly and with what effects? The evidence is quite limited, especially for advanced economies. We adopt a historical laboratory. From the 1950s to the 1980s, the UK used credit policy tools alongside conventional interest rate policy. These tools are similar to today\u2019s macroprudential policies. We document these tools and craft a new dataset to estimate their effects using modern high-frequency identification with a novel empirical strategy, Factor-Augmented Local Projection. Monetary policy acted mainly on inflation but credit policy acted primarily to modulate bank lending.\n\n",
