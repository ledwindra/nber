ABSTRACT
The current study finds that societies which historically engaged in plough agriculture today have lower
fertility. We argue, and provide ethnographic evidence, that the finding is explained by the fact that
with plough agriculture, children, like women, are relatively less useful in the field. The plough requires
strength and eliminates the need for weeding, a task particularly suitable for women and children.
This in turn generates a preference for fewer children, lowering fertility.

I. Introduction
Recent studies provide evidence that a significant portion of the cross-country variation in
female labor force participation and fertility can be explained by cultural norms.1 In a recent
paper, we examine the historical origins of these cultural differences (see Alberto Alesina, Paola
Giuliano and Nathan Nunn, 2010). We test the long-standing hypothesis, first developed by Ester
Boserup (1970), that different attitudes about gender roles evolved because of differences in the
form of agriculture traditionally practiced. In societies with shifting cultivation, agriculture is
labor intensive, cultivation uses a hoe or a digging stick, and women actively participate. In
contrast, with intensive cultivation, which uses the plough, agricultural work requires significant
strength. In these societies men tend to specialize in agriculture and women tend to specialize in
home production and other work within the domestic sphere. Boserup argues that the differences
in the two types of agriculture resulted in different norms about the natural role of women in
society. In societies featuring plough agriculture, gender attitudes typically exhibit less equality
regarding the role of men and women in society, and the view that the appropriate role for women
is in the domestic sphere is much more common.
In Alesina, Giuliano and Nunn (2010), we test Boserup’s hypothesis by constructing a
measure of historic plough-use among the ancestors of populations today. We show that a history

immigrants and show that women’s fertility and labor market participation are strongly correlated with the past
fertility rates in the immigrants’ home countries. Also see Nicole Fortin (2005) and Raquel Fernandez (2007).

of plough agriculture, today, is associated with attitudes of gender inequality, and with less female
participation in the labor force, entrepreneurial activities, and politics.2
In the present paper, we continue this line of enquiry by analyzing the effect of historic
plough use on beliefs about fertility. At first, one may expect that societies with historic plough
use – and unequal gender roles – will have higher levels of fertility. If women are less likely to
participate in market activities outside of the home, this lowers the cost of having children and
increases fertility. The current study tests this hypothesis, and finds a surprising result: societies
that historically engaged in plough agriculture today have lower fertility, not higher fertility. We
show that this relationship is robust and is not caused by statistical outliers or omitted variables
bias. We argue, and provide ethnographic evidence, that the finding is explained by the fact that
with plough agriculture, children, like women, are relatively less useful in the field. The plough
requires strength and eliminates the need for weeding, a task particularly suitable for women and
children. This in turn generates a preference for fewer children, lowering fertility.
II. Data and Estimation Results
Our empirical analysis begins by examining the cross-country relationship between
traditional plough use and fertility today. The measure of historic plough use, which we take from
Alesina, Giuliano and Nunn (2010), is constructed using information, from the Ethnographic
Atlas, on the traditional use of the plough among 1267 ethnic groups worldwide (see George Peter
Murdock, 1967).3 The ethnographic data is then matched to current populations using the global
distribution of 7,612 language groups from the 15th edition of the Ethnologue and the global
distribution of population densities from the 2000 Landscan database. An important point is that

The analysis examines variation across countries, districts within countries, and ethnic groups. We show that the
results are robust to various estimation strategies and to a large set of historic and contemporary covariates. See
Alesina, Giuliano and Nunn (2010) for full details.

the procedure link the past to the present using language and ethnicity, not geography. This is
important because we are interested in culture, which is geographically mobile. In the end, the
construction procedure generates a measure of the fraction of a country’s ancestors that
traditionally engaged in plough agriculture.
The outcome of interest is a country’s current total fertility rate, which we view as an
objective measure that captures a country’s attitude towards fertility.4 In the analysis, we are
careful to control for other factors, besides cultural beliefs, that also affect fertility. These include:
the level of economic development, measured by the natural log of a country’s real per capita
GDP, and a country’s rate of female labor force participation. We also control for a rich set of
historic ethnographic controls that measure the historic characteristics of a country’s ancestors in
the late 19th and early 20th century and are constructed using the same procedure as for the plough
variable. The controls include: the presence of domesticated bovine or equine animals; the
presence of tropical or subtropical climate; the number of levels of political hierarchy beyond the
local community (political complexity); and a measure of the sophistication of settlement
(economic complexity). For full details of all variables see Alesina, Giuliano and Nunn (2010).
Estimation results are reported in Table 1. Columns 1 and 2 present estimates without and
with continent fixed effects. The estimates show a strong negative relationship between the
historic use of the plough and fertility today. According to the estimated magnitudes from column
1, a one standard deviation increase in historic plough use is associated with a decline in fertility
of 0.52 children, which is equal to 17% of the sample’s mean fertility.5 To ensure that the
estimates are not biased by any effect of the plough on female labor force participation, we

The data are from the United Nations’ Demographic Yearbook. The total fertility rate is calculated as the average
number of children a hypothetical cohort of women, from the ages of 15 to 49, would have at the end of their
reproductive period if they were subject during their whole lives to the age-specific average fertility rates of a given
country in a given time period. The measure is from 2007.

Figure 1. Partial correlation plot (column 1 of table 1).
The finding of a negative relationship between historic plough use and fertility contradicts
the expectation that because historic plough-use resulted in less female participation outside of the
5

home, it generated higher fertility. There are a number of potential explanations for this puzzling
finding. First, the results could be driven by a small number of unimportant countries. Figure 1,
which reports the partial correlation plot from column 1, shows that this is not the case. The
relationship appears to be general and not driven by outliers.
It is also possible that the estimates are spurious and driven by omitted variables. An
obvious potentially omitted factor is the level of economic development. If plough societies are
(and/or were) more developed, then the negative relationship between development and fertility
may account for the negative relationship between historic plough-use and fertility today.
However, our specifications already include a number of measures of economic development,
both current and historical. Therefore, we feel that this explanation is unlikely. This being said, to
further address this, and to address concerns of omitted variables bias more generally, we provide
IV estimates of the effect of the plough on fertility.
Following Alesina, Giuliano and Nunn (2010), we exploit the variation in historic plough
use that arose from differences in societies’ geo-climatic conditions, which affected whether crops
that potentially benefitted from the plough were cultivated. As Frederic L. Pryor (1985) explains,
because of differences in the length of the cropping season, the amount of land required for
cultivation, and the characteristics of the soil (slope, depth, rockiness, etc), crops differ
significantly in the extent to which the use of the plough improves productivity. In his study,
Pryor identifies crops as being either plough-positive (cultivation greatly benefits from the
plough) or plough-negative (cultivation benefits less from the plough).6

6

Plough positive crops, which typically require extensive land preparation over a large surface area and in a very
short period of time, include wet rice, barley, wheat, rye, and teff. Plough-negative crops, which include crops that
require relatively little land to produce a sufficient amount of food, crops that can be grown in rocky or sloped land,
and crops with seeds that easily take root (even in shallow soils), include tree crops, root crops, maize, millet, and
sorghum (Pryor, 1985, p. 732).

6

As in Alesina, Giuliano and Nunn (2010), we use as instruments the average geo-climatic
suitability of ancestors’ locations for growing: (i) sorghum and millet (two plough-negative cereal
crops) and (ii) wheat and rye (two plough-positive cereal crops).7 This identification strategy
relies on the assumption that, holding constant overall crop productivity (which we control for),
the distinction between plough-positive and plough-negative geo-climatic environments only
impacts fertility through the plough.
Instrumental variable estimates are reported in columns 5-8 of Table 1. The IV estimates
also show that historic plough use is associated with lower fertility today.8 The consistency of the
OLS and IV estimates make it unlikely that the negative relationship between historic plough-use
and fertility is due to omitted variables bias.
In our view, the most likely explanation for the counter-intuitive result is as follows. It is
true that the plough caused women to specialization in work within the home, and this should
have decreased the costs of childcare, resulting in norms of greater fertility. However, the benefit
to having children was also affected by the plough. Since shifting hoe agriculture (relative to
intensive plough agriculture) was relatively more suitable for participation by women and
children, and because this form of agriculture was relatively labor intensive, the demand for
additional labor, including children was greater under hoe agriculture than under plough
agriculture. Therefore, there were two counteracting forces: the plough decreased the cost of
having children, but it also decreased the benefit. Our finding that societies that historically

7

For each historic ethnic group the centroid of their historic location is known. We use the fraction of land within a
200-kilometer radius of the centroid that can grow each crop as the measure of ancestors’ suitability. Information on
the suitability of locations across the globe for cultivating various crops is from FAO’s GAEZ 2002 database.
8
Because of space constraints we do not report the first stage estimates. The first stage of the IV shows that
suitability for the cultivation of plough-positive cereals is positively correlated with the adoption of the plough, while
suitability for the cultivation of plough-negative cereals is negatively correlated with the plough. In all specifications,
the difference between the two coefficients is statistically significant at the 1% level.

7

practiced plough agriculture today have lower rates of fertility suggests that the lower benefit
from the plough was more important than the lower cost.
If this explanation is correct, then we should observe that historically societies that
engaged in plough agriculture had preferences for lower fertility. We are able to test this using
ethnographic information from George Peter Murdock and Douglas R. White’s (1969) Standard
Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS), which contains information on 186 societies globally. The sample
includes a measure of preferences for children (variable v950) among 47 of the 186 societies for
which data are available. Societies fall into one of three categories: (i) those with a preference to
have very few children, (ii) those with no clear preference for the number of children, and (iii)
those with a preference for a large number of children. Based on this classification, we create a
variable that takes on the values of 1, 2, or 3, and is increasing in a preference for more children.
The correlation between this variable and an indicator that equals one if the society historically
used the plough (variable v243) is -0.31, which is significant at the 5% level. Even examining
within continent variation only (i.e., controlling for continent fixed effects) one continues to find a
statistically significant relationship of a similar magnitude (the beta coefficient is -0.34). This
finding is consistent with our explanation that plough agriculture reduced the benefit of having
children (since they were less useful in the fields), and this resulted in a preference for fewer
children, which continues to persist today.
III. Is Cultural Transmission the Channel?
Implicit in our hypothesis is the assumption that the link between past plough-use and
fertility today is explained by cultural persistence. However, we have not yet shown this. Past
plough use may have also affected the evolution of formal laws and institutions, like tax

8

structures or parental leave laws, which affect the cost of having children and fertility. Therefore,
the effect may be through is through domestic institutions, not cultural persistence.
In an attempt to identify cultural transmission as the mechanism, we examine migrants
living within the US. Migrants face the same markets and institutions (since they are all in the
US), but they have different cultural backgrounds (and different histories of cultural
transmission). Therefore, if we find a persistent impact of the plough among immigrants living in
the US, then we can be more confident that the effect we are identifying is through cultural
transmission.
Our sample, which is from the 1970 Census, includes first and second generation married
immigrant women. We identify the cultural heritage of second-generation immigrants using the
father’s country of origin.9 Our outcome variable of interest the number of children ever born to
the woman. The estimating equation includes the following control variables: a quadratic for age,
years of educational attainment, employment status fixed effects (employed, unemployed, or out
of the labor force), and the natural log of the individual’s income. We also control for the
following characteristics of the woman’s husband: a quadratic for his age, years of education,
employment status fixed effects, and the natural log of his income. All regressions also include
state and metropolitan status fixed effects, and the natural log of the per capita GDP of the
immigrant’s country of origin.
OLS and IV estimates are reported in table 2. As in the cross-country setting, we continue
to find a negative association between immigrants’ fertility and a tradition of plough agriculture.
According to the estimates from column 1, a one standard deviation increase in historic plough
use is associated with a decline of 0.21 children, which is equivalent to 9% of mean first-

because this is the last year in which the census asks individuals their parents’ country of origin.

generation immigrant fertility. The results are slightly higher for second-generation immigrants
(column 2). A one standard deviation increase in historic plough use is associated with a decline
of 0.33 children (which is 12% of the mean of second-generation immigrant fertility). The IV
estimates are similar, but with coefficients that are slightly larger in magnitude.
Overall, the immigrant estimates are approximately half the magnitude of the crosscountry estimates. This is expected since the cross-country analysis captures cultural transmission
as well as other channels of persistence (e.g., domestic institutions), while the immigrant
regressions only captures the cultural channel.

IV. Conclusions
This paper has provided evidence that the form of agriculture traditionally practiced –
intensive plough agriculture versus shifting hoe agriculture – affected historic norms and
preferences about fertility, and that these norms persist, affecting observed fertility around the
world today.

10

We find a negative correlation between historic plough use and total fertility rates today
across countries and among first and second generation immigrants in the US. We argue that the
explanation for this result lies in the fact that children (like women) are less useful for plough
agriculture. The plough requires strength and obviates the need for weeding, a task particularly
suitable for women and children. Therefore, where plough agriculture was practiced, the cost of
having children may have been lower (because women were more confined to the home), but the
benefit of children was also lower (since they were less useful in agriculture). We also show that,
consistent with this explanation, societies that historically used the plough were also more likely
to have a preference for a fewer children.
