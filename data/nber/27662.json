    "abstract": "\n\nEvidence suggests that many firms in lower-income countries stagnate because they cannot access growth-conducive markets. We hypothesize that overlooked informational barriers distort market access, excluding productive but \u201cinformation-poor\u201d suppliers. To investigate, we gave a random subset of medium-sized Liberian firms vouchers for a week-long program targeting equal-opportunity access to the input purchases of government, companies, and other organizations\u2014a market that makes up upwards of 80 percent of global GDP. The program exclusively teaches \u201csellership\u201d: how to navigate large buyers\u2019 complex, formal sourcing procedures. Firms that participate win three times as many formal contracts a year later. The impact is heterogeneous: informational sales barriers bind for about a quarter of Liberian firms. Three years post-training, these firms continue to win desirable contracts, are more likely to operate, and employ more workers. We use a simple model of managers\u2019 time-constraints to illustrate a possible explanation for why informational market access barriers can persist and generate poverty-trap-like dynamics among firms, even absent credit constraints. Our results help rationalize common demand-side policies in public procurement that nonetheless appear to scratch at the surface of a bigger distortion.\n\n",
