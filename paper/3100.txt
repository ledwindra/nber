THE MCKIBBIN-SACHS GLOBAL MODEL:

THEORY AND SPECIFICATION

ABSTRACT
This paper presents the theoretical underpinnings of the MSG2 simulation model
of the world economy. The MSG2 model is a dynamic general equilibrium model of
the world economy which pays particular attention to the relation between
stocks and flows and intertemporal constraints. The formation of expectations
also plays an important role in the model. In the version presented here the
world is divided into the U.S., Japan, Germany, the rest of the EMS, and the
rest of the OECD, non-oil developing countries and OPEC.
