Consistent Expectations, Rational Expectations, Multiple-Solution Indeterminacies,

and Least-Squares Learnability

September 2002
JEL No. C32, E00, C63
ABSTRACT
After some historical discussion of the rational expectations (RE) solution procedures of
John Muth, Alan Walters, and Robert Lucas, this paper considers the relevance for actual economies
of issues stemming from the existence of multiple RE equilibria. In all linear models, the minimum
state variable (MSV) solution——as defined by the author (JME, 1983)——is unique by
construction. While it might be argued that the MSV solution warrants special status as the bubblefree solution, the focus in this paper is on its adaptive, least-squares learnability by individual agents,
as discussed extensively in important recent publications by George Evans and Seppo Honkapohja.
Although the MSV solution is learnable and the main alternatives are not, in most standard
models, Evans and Honkapohja have stressed an example in which the opposite is true. The present
paper shows, however, that parameter values yielding that result are such that the model is not well
formulated, in a specified sense (one that avoids implausible discontinuities). More generally,
analysis of a pair of prominent univariate specifications, featured by Evans and Honkapohja, shows
that the MSV solution is invariably learnable in these structures, if they are well formulated.

1. Introduction
It is not widely known, I believe, that the first publication to present a rational
expectations analysis of a complete macroeconomic/monetary model was authored by
A. A. Walters (1971). This paper, “Consistent Expectations, Distributed Lags, and the
Quantity Theory,” appeared somewhat earlier in the year than Thomas Sargent’s (1971)
justly influential “A Note on the Accelerationist Controversy,” and furthermore the latter did
not feature the explicit solution of a full macroeconomic model.1 Robert Lucas’s first two
money/macro papers with rational expectations (1972a, 1972b) had been presented at
conferences in 1970-71 but had not yet appeared in print.
Of course Walters termed his expectational hypothesis “consistent expectations,”
rather than rational expectations (RE), and refers to John Muth’s (1961) seminal paper only
briefly, in a footnote.2 But that does not diminish the insightfulness of Walters’s analysis.
Indeed, this reader is left with the feeling that his expectational hypothesis and method of
analysis were worked out independently of previous writings, with knowledge of Muth’s
paper perhaps arriving rather late in the publication process.
In the 30-plus years since 1971 a lot of activity has taken place in the area of RE
money/macro analysis, to put it mildly. Consequently, I have no intention of trying to survey
the many developments that have taken place. But I would like to take up some particular
issues concerning solution concepts and the problem of “indeterminacy,” or multiple
solutions, in RE models. I will begin in Section 2 by outlining Walters’s solution procedure
and contrasting it with the one used by Muth (1961). Then, in Section 3, I will outline

Sargent’s paper, like Walters’s, emphasizes that fixed distributed-lag formulas for expectations can be
consistently incorrect, since they fail to reflect policy processes.

later in Krugman (1994, p. 49).

Lucas’s (1972b) procedure and turn to the topic of multiple solutions, which has been active
for many years and recently has become increasingly prominent. My own “minimum-statevariable” interpretation and extension of Lucas’s procedure, developed in McCallum (1983),
is also discussed and the dependence of several recent controversies on the solution concept
is emphasized. Next, Section 4 describes an approach to selection among multiple solutions,
based on the criteria of E-stability and adaptive learnability, that was initiated in the 1980s by
George Evans and recently treated comprehensively in major publications by Evans and
Honkapohja (1999, 2001). Section 5 examines an example featured by those authors in
which their criterion conflicts with my own, and argues that this conflict occurs only with
parameter values that make the model economically implausible. That argument is rather ad
hoc in nature, however, so Section 6 proposes some general requirements for a model to be
regarded as plausible or “well formulated.” The paper’s main result is in Section 7, which
shows that for an important class of well formulated models, the unique MSV solution is
invariably learnable. Finally, Section 8 provides a brief summary and conclusion.
2. Consistent and Rational Expectations
Walters (1971) analyzed price level behavior in a model that is fairly similar to the
standard workhorse for monetary RE analysis, which includes the Cagan (1956) money
demand function and a policy process represented in terms of money supply. Walters’s
money-demand equation is written as
(1)

pt = αmt-1 + β(pet − pt-1) + εt,

with α > 0 and 0 < β < 1. Here the dating of variables differs from the version that has
become standard and, for some reason, pt and mt represent the price level and the money
stock, rather than their logarithms. The expectational variable is pet, the expectation of pt

2

formed at time t−1. The shock term εt is taken to be purely random (i.e., white noise) so its
expectation at t−1 is zero and thus we have pet = αmt-1 + β(pet − pt-1). Consequently, we can
solve out pet and obtain the solution expression
(2)

pt = [α/(1−β)] mt-1 − [β/(1−β)] pt-1 + εt.

It will be noted that the foregoing solution procedure—of taking expectations, solving for pet,
and substituting out the latter—cannot be used when pet+1 enters the system.
Walters (1971) considers the implied paths of pt, and representations of pet, for three
different money supply processes. The paper’s main message is that the pet representations
usually do not satisfy the adaptive expectations formula, pet = (1−λ)[pt-1 + λpt-2 + λ2pt-3 + ...],
that was very widely used at the time. Indeed, any fixed distributed-lag formula for
expectations will be systematically incorrect unless it happens to reflect the money supply
process. This important conclusion, which was also the main message of Sargent (1971), is
a precursor of the famed Lucas (1976) critique. Two limitations of Walters’s analysis are
that (i) the effect of shocks to the money supply is not considered and (ii) the model is not
extended to include structural equations of a more standard macroeconomic system with
sluggish price adjustments of the expectational Phillips-curve type.
Walters (1971, p. 273; 1988, p. 290) has expressed the view that the term “consistent
expectations” is preferable to rational expectations, and I would not strongly disagree. I
would argue, however, that the related term “model-consistent expectations” is somewhat
undesirable.3 The reason is that it leads to easily into an anti-RE argument such as “it is
implausible that all of an economy’s agents would believe in the particular model of the

3

This term has been used by many writers including Brayton et. al. (1997) and Isard, Laxton, and Eliasson
(1999).

3

economy being used by the researcher.”4 My objection (McCallum, 1999b) is that this
statement does not represent the assumption that is actually required for the basic version of
RE. The proper assumption is that agents form expectations so as to avoid systematic
expectational errors in actuality, which implies that each agent behaves as if he knew the
structure of the actual economy. Then expectations will agree with the researcher’s model,
but the reason is that the latter is by design his best attempt to depict the true structure of the
actual economy—for if it were not, he would adopt a different model. There is no
assumption that agents consciously create explicit models at all, only that they manage their
own private affairs so as to avoid systematic expectational errors in actuality.
From here on I will use Etzt+j to denote E(zt+j|Ωt), where Ωt is the information set at t,
typically (but not necessarily) taken to include all variables dated t and earlier. Using this
notation, the first of Muth’s (1961) two models can be written as
(3)

−βpt = γEt-1pt + ut,

where pt is a market price and ut is a random shock term. If the latter is white noise, the same
∞

solution procedure as Walters’s could be used, but Muth generalizes to permit ut =

∑w ε
i =0

i t −i

where εt is white noise. Then to obtain a solution he essentially applies an undetermined
coefficient approach to the moving-average solution form
∞

(4)

pt =

∑Wε
i =0

i t −i

in order to evaluate the Wis in terms of β, γ, and the wis. That same strategy is adequate, and
is used, with Muth’s second and more complex model. The latter, which recognizes

4

A variant is the claim that it is implausible that all agents would believe in the same model of the economy.
But, first, this is an objection to macroeconomics, not rational expectations, and second, there are some RE
models in which agents’ expectations are not all alike.

inventory speculation, can be expressed as
(5)

−βpt + It = γEt-1pt + ut + It-1

(6)

It = α(Etpt+1 − pt)

where It is inventory holdings at the end of t, −βpt is consumption demand in t, and γEt-1pt +
ut is production. Substituting (6) into (5), one obtains an equation involving pt, Et-1pt, Etpt+1,
and pt-1 as well as ut. Again the solution procedure of undetermined coefficients (henceforth,
UC) in terms of the moving average representation of the solution (i.e., in terms of εt, εt-1, ...)
is applicable, but now it leads to a quadratic characteristic equation. Muth selects between
the two roots on the grounds of boundness—i.e., non-explosiveness or dynamic stability—of
the resulting solution. This same procedure could be applied if additional exogenous shocks
were included in the model, so we see that Muth’s (1961) paper developed a solution
procedure—and an implicit solution concept—for a rather wide class of linear models.5
3. Multiple Solutions and the MSV Concept
Lucas (1972a, 1972b) provided the next—enormously influential—publications with
RE in money/macro models. The former was the greater piece of work, of course, but for
present purposes it will be useful to focus on the simplified linear model in the second.
There Lucas’s aggregate demand-supply system includes a Phillips-type supply function and
a logarithmic nominal income identity, plus a policy rule assumed for simplicity to pertain
directly to nominal income. I will not now discuss the model itself, since it includes some
questionable features, but will go immediately to the relevant point. This is that Lucas’s
solution procedure involves a UC calculation not in terms of moving average parameters, but
5

To me, writing without the benefit of inside information, it seems possible that recognition of the extent of
Muth’s achievement may have provided a major reason for Walters to have abstained from additional research
in the area during the 1970s. Matthews (1998) suggests that the dominant reason was the attitude taken by the

5

with respect to the parameters (coefficients) of a conjectured solution form that includes only
the variables and shocks recognized to be relevant to the current state of the system, i.e., the
relevant state variables.
The importance of this step can be illustrated simply in terms of the following basic,
non-specific, model:
(7)

yt = α + aEtyt+1 + ut

(8)

ut = ρut-1 + εt.

Here |ρ| < 1 and εt is white noise. Since there are no relevant state variables in sight except
ut,6 it is natural to conjecture a solution of the form
(9)

yt = φ0 + φ1ut,

and then solve for the coefficients φ0 and φ1.

Since (9) implies Etyt+1 = φ0 + φ1ρut,

substitution into (7) gives φ0 + φ1ut = α + a(φ0 + φ1ρut) + ut, which implies
(10a) φ0 = α + aφ0
(10b) φ1 = aρφ1 + 1.
Thus we have φ1 = 1/(1−aρ) and φ0 = α/(1−a), the unique solution that is of form (9).
But there are more solutions. Suppose that one enters the apparently extraneous variables yt-1 and ut-1 into the following candidate solution expression that might be considered
instead of (9):
(11)

yt = φ0 + φ1yt-1 + φ2ut + φ3ut-1.

Then proceeding as before leads to the UC equalities

Economic Journal’s editor, David Champernone, who was not favorably inclined toward the hypothesis of
consistent or rational expectations.
6
One could proceed equivalently in terms of ut-1 and εt, since ut is AR(1).

6

(12a) φ0 = α + aφ0 + aφ1φ0
(12b) φ1 = a φ12
(12c) φ2 = aφ1φ2 + aρφ2 + 1
(12d) φ3 = aφ1φ3.
The second of these is satisfied by φ1( − ) = 0 or by φ1( + ) = 1/a. The first of these roots implies a
solution equivalent to the one given previously, but the second leads to the solution
(13)

yt = −(α/a) + (1/a)yt-1 − (1/aρ)ut + φ3ut-1,

which is consistent with all of the model’s equations for any value of φ3. Thus there is an
infinity of solutions, if ones of form (11) are considered. In some models based firmly on
full optimizing analysis, there will be transversality conditions that exclude explosive
solutions, which would eliminate this infinity if |a| < 1, as would usually be the case. But
there are several notable examples in the literature in which relations such as (13) qualify as
solutions under stringent optimizing assumptions.
To many workers, Lucas’s procedure of restricting attention to solutions of a form
such as (9) will be attractive, since it is capable of generating solutions that are based only on
fundamentals—thereby excluding “bubble” components that involve variables that do not
enter the model and therefore can appear in the solution only because they are (arbitrarily)
expected (by the model’s agents) to be relevant. This elimination of bubble solutions does
not occur if one adopts a moving average formulation, in the fashion preferred by Muth
(1961). Partly for this reason, perhaps, Lucas’s approach rapidly gained popularity during
the 1970s.
An issue arises, however, in models that include lagged values of endogenous
variables. Suppose that the relevant model includes

7

(14)

yt = α + aEtyt+1 + cyt-1 + ut

rather than (7), in addition to (8). Then the solution clearly must include yt-1 as well as ut as a
relevant state variable. And then if one searches for a solution of the form
(15)

yt = φ0 + φ1yt-1 + φ2ut,

it will be found that Etyt+1 = φ0 + φ1(φ0 + φ1yt-1 + φ2ut) + φ2ρut and the UC equations become
(16a) φ0 = α + aφ0 + aφ1φ0
(16b) φ1 = a φ12 + c
(16c) φ2 = aφ1φ2 + aρφ2 + 1.
In this case there are two solutions, one based on
(17)

φ1( − ) =

1 − 1 − 4ac
2a

and the other on
(18)

φ1( + ) =

1 + 1 − 4ac
,
2a

where we use the convention that

z is positive for all z > 0. Of course, we shall require

that φ1 be real-valued, since complex solutions make no sense for prices or quantities. But
whenever there is a real solution there seem to be two—which will often have very different
properties—even if we follow the Lucas (1972b) procedure.
A solution concept that provides uniqueness was proposed, however, by McCallum
(1983). Clearly, the two expressions (17) and (18) define two different functions and
therefore two quite distinct solutions to the model (14)(8). Consequently, consider the
special case of (14) in which c = 0. In this case yt-1 does not enter the model and thus could
be considered to be an extraneous state variable, which should not appear in the solution, if it
is to include only relevant state variables. Accordingly, McCallum (1981, 1983) proposed
8

that since φ1( − ) equals 0 in this special case, and φ1( + ) does not, then the solution based on φ1( − )
should be regarded as the relevant solution. His (1983) paper develops a rather general
procedure for finding this “bubble-free” solution, which is unique by construction in linear
models.7 This procedure was given the name “minimum state variable” (MSV) solution by
Evans (1986), who referred to the step of choosing between the two roots in the last example
as constituting a “subsidiary principle.” In what follows it will be important to be
unambiguous about the concept of a MSV solution. Throughout I will be using that term to
designate the unique solution—unique by construction—described in McCallum (1983,
1999). This is the way that the term was used by Evans (1986, 1989) and by Evans and
Honkapohja (1992), but differs from the terminology in the latter’s more recent publications
(1999, p. 496; 2001, p. 194), where their convention permits multiple solutions to be given
the MSV adjective. Either terminology could be used, of course, but the one adopted here is
more appropriate for the issues at hand.
Recently, the possible occurrence of multiple solutions has assumed new prominence
in the area of monetary economics under the heading of “indeterminacies.” Notable topics in
which indeterminacy is central to policy issues include (i) inflation forecast targeting [e.g.,
Woodford (1994), Bernanke and Woodford (1996), King (2000)], (ii) the Taylor Principle
[Woodford (2001), King (2000), Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1997, 1999)], (iii) the zerolower-bound deflation trap [Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohe, and Uribe (2001), Schmitt-Grohe and
Uribe (2000), McCallum (2002), Alstadheim and Henderson (2002)], and (iv) the fiscal
theory of the price level [Woodford (1995), Sims (1994), Cochrane (1998), McCallum
(2001), Kotcherlakota and Phelan (1999)].
7

The MSV solution is required, by definition, to be linear. For a discussion of this and several other points, see

9

In this context it is important to recognize that the type of indeterminacy present in all
of these cases involves multiple RE solutions and accordingly is quite different from the
“price level indeterminacy” problem that was discussed extensively in the monetary literature
of the 1940s and 1950s by Lange (1942), Patinkin (1949, 1961, 1965), Gurley and Shaw
(1960), and Johnson (1962). In particular, the former involves multiple time paths for real
variables even with some nominal variable fixed (as a consequence of dynamic expectational
behavior) whereas the latter involves the model’s failure to determine any nominal variable
despite unique paths for all real variables (occurring as a consequence of the absence of any
nominal anchor, a static concept). I have suggested several times that a more constructive
terminology would refer to “multiple solutions” and “nominal indeterminacy,” respectively,
but thus far have made little headway.
In any event, one’s position on policy issues relating to the four topics (i)-(iv)
logically depends on his beliefs concerning the status of multiple RE solutions. Are such
multiplicities relevant in principle and empirically for actual economies, or are they
theoretical curiosa with little or no relevance to actual economies? The following sections
present the outline of an argument in favor of the latter position.
4. E-Stability and Learnability
In a series of articles appearing in the 1980s, George Evans (1985, 1986, 1989)
proposed an alternative criterion for designation or “selection” of the economically relevant
RE solution in cases in which multiplicity obtains. His initial criterion, now known as
iterative E-stability, can be briefly reviewed. The basic presumption is that individual
economic agents will not be endowed with perfect knowledge of the economic system’s
structure, so it is natural to consider whether plausible error-correction mechanisms are
McCallum (1999).

10

convergent to particular solutions. This can be determined for each of the multiple RE
solutions, and the presence or absence of such mechanisms may yield a criterion for selection
of one solution as economically relevant. For an illustration, consider again the model
(14)(8), which we rewrite for convenience:
(14)

yt = α + aEtyt+1 + cyt-1 + ut

(8)

ut = ρut-1 + εt.

Suppose that the economy’s individuals believe that the actual behavior of yt can be
expressed by an equation that includes the same variables as (15), but that they do not know
the exact values of the parameters. If at time t the typical agent’s belief is that these values
are φ0(n), φ1(n), and φ2(n), then the system’s perceived law of motion (PLM) will be8
(19)

yt = φ0(n) + φ1(n)yt-1 + φ2(n)ut.

In this case the implied expectation at t of yt+1 will be
(20)

φ0(n) + φ1(n)yt + φ2(n)ρut.

Using that expression in place of Etyt+1 in (14)—which implies that we are temporarily
abandoning RE—gives
(21)

yt = α + a [φ0(n) + φ1(n)yt + φ2(n)ρut] + cyt-1 + ut

or, rearranging,
(22)

yt = [1−aφ1(n)]-1 [α + aφ0(n) + aφ2(n)ρut + cyt-1 + ut]

as the system’s actual law of motion (ALM). Now imagine a sequence of iterations from the
PLM to the ALM. Writing the left-hand side of (22) in the form (19), but for iteration n+1,
gives φ0(n+1) + φ1(n+1)yt-1 + φ2(n+1)ut = [1−aφ1(n)]-1 [α + aφ0(n) + aφ2(n)ρut + cyt-1 + ut]
and therefore implies that

8

Here n is being used to index iterations in an eductive process of learning that takes place in meta-time.

11

(23a) φ0(n+1) = [1 − aφ1(n)]-1[α + a φ0(n)]
(23b) φ1(n+1) = [1 − aφ1(n)]-1c
(23c) φ2(n+1) = [1 − aφ1(n)]-1[aφ2(n)ρ + 1].
The issue, then, is whether iterations defined by (23) are such that the φj(n) converge to the φj
values in (15) as n increases without bound. If they do, then the solution (15) is said to be
iteratively E-stable. Evans (1986) found that in several prominent and controversial models
the MSV solution is iteratively E-stable.
On the basis of results by Marcet and Sargent (1989), Evans (1989) switched his
attention to E-stability without the “iterative” qualification, defined as follows. Conversion
of equations (23) to the continuous form, appropriate as the iteration interval approaches
zero, yields
(24a) dφ0(n)/dn = [1 − aφ1(n)]-1[α + a φ0(n)] − φ0(n)
(24b) dφ1(n)/dn = [1 − aφ1(n)]-1c − φ1(n)
(24c) dφ2(n)/dn = [1 − aφ1(n)]-1[a φ2(n)ρ + 1] − φ2(n).
If the differential equation system (24) has φj(n) → φj for all j, the solution (15) is E-stable.
An important feature of this continuous version of the iterative process is that it is intimately
related to an adaptive learning process that is modelled as taking place in real time.9 For
most non-explosive models, that is, values of parameters analogous to the φj in (15), which
are estimated by least squares (LS) regressions on the basis of data from periods t−1, t−2, …,
1 and used to form expectations in period t, will converge to the actual values in (15) as time
passes if and only if equations (24) converge to those values. Thus E-stability and LS
9

The E-stability process itself is conceived of as taking place in notional time (meta time). For the sake of
brevity, the present account omits discussion of several important papers on learning; for many references, see
Evans and Honkapohja (1999, 2001).

12

learnability typically go hand in hand.10 This result, which is discussed extensively by Evans
and Honkapohja (1999, 2001), is useful because it is technically much easier, in most cases,
to establish E-stability than to establish LS learnability.11
5. Questionable Example
As mentioned above, Evans’s early work indicated that the E-stability/learnability
principle often supports the MSV criterion. More recently, however, the implied message
has been quite different. Thus in various places Evans and Honkapohja (E&H) have argued
that MSV solutions may or may not have the property of E-stability (and LS learnability). It
is my belief, however, that this recent message is misleading; that in all or almost all sensible
models the MSV solution does possess E-stability. Thus the agenda of this section is to
discuss and reconsider the main example put forth by E&H (1992, pp. 9-10; 1999, pp. 496-7;
2001, p. 197) as representing a case in which the MSV solution is not E-stable.
Following E&H (1992), the relevant model’s reduced form can be written as
yt = α + γEt-1yt + ζEt-1yt+1 + δyt-1 + εt,

(25)

with δ ≠ 0, ζ ≠ 0, and εt white noise. The MSV solution will be of the form
(26)

yt = φ0 + φ1yt-1 + φ2 εt,

and φ1 will be determined by a quadratic equation with the MSV solution given by the φ1 root
that equals zero when δ = 0. The other root gives a bubble solution and there are also bubble
solutions of a form that includes additional terms involving yt-2 and εt-1 on the right-hand side
of (26).
Necessary conditions for E-stability of a solution of form (26) are (E&H, 1992, p. 6)
10

It is interesting to note that a modelling strategy closely related to LS learning is explicitly mentioned by
Walters (1971, p. 281).

13

(27)

γ + ζ − 1 + ζφ1 < 0 and γ − 1 + 2ζφ1 < 0.

On the basis of these, E&H show on their pp. 9-10 that the non-MSV solution of form (26) is
E-stable, and the MSV solution is E-unstable, when γ = −ζ > 1 and δ > 0. Also, on p. 5 they
show that the bubble solutions are E-stable if γ > 1, δζ > 0, and ζ < 0. If such parameter
values were economically sensible, these results would constitute explicit counter-examples
to my suggestion that MSV solutions are invariably E-stable.
Let us, however, reconsider the economic model that E&H (1992) use to motivate the
reduced form equation (25). It is a log-linear “model of aggregate demand and supply with
wealth effects in aggregate demand, money demand, and aggregate supply” (1992, p. 9).
Letting yt, mt, and pt be the logs of output, money, and the price level, with it a nominal
interest rate, they write:12
(28a) yt = −g1(it − Et-1(pt+1 − pt)) + g2(mt − pt) + v1t
(28b) yt = f(mt − pt) + v2t
(28c) mt − pt = yt − a1it + a2(mt − pt) + v3t
(28d) mt = d pt-1 + v4t.
The fourth equation “is a monetary policy reaction function….” (1992, p. 9). Solving these
four equations for a reduced form expression for pt gives
(29)

pt = d pt-1 + h Et-1(pt − pt+1) + ut

with h = g1[f−g2 + g1(a2+f − 1)a1-1]-1 and where ut is a linear combination of the (white noise)
vit terms. Consequently, the model is of form (25) with yt in the latter representing pt in the
model and with γ = h, ζ = −h, and δ = d.
11

For a notable recent application to monetary policy analysis, see Bullard and Mitra (2000).
Here (28b) is aggregate supply and (28c) is money demand. It is my distinct impression that E&H intend for
all parameters to be interpreted as non-negative.

12

14

It follows, then, that the condition γ = −ζ > 1 requires h > 1. In that regard, note first
that if real-balance terms are excluded, i.e., if g2 = f = a2 = 0, then h = − a1 is negative. Thus
sizeable real-balance effects are needed. Second, note that a2 should probably be specified as
negative, not positive, since the latter would imply a money demand function with income
elasticity greater than 1.0, in contrast with most empirical estimates. But with a2 < 0, the
parameter f would have to be quite large to generate h > 1. In other words, real money
balances would have to enter strongly in the production function for output. Thus h > 1
seems highly improbable in the context of the IS-LM model of the type utilized.
In addition, the condition δ > 0 implies d > 0 in (28d), implying that the money
supply is increased by the monetary authority when the price level is higher than average in
the previous period. That represents, it seems clear, a positively perverse form of policy
behavior.
An alternative way of interpreting the reduced-form equation (25), not mentioned by
E&H, is as a microeconomic supply-demand model. Suppose we have demand and supply
functions
(30a) qt = β0 + β1pt + β2Et-1(pt+1 − pt) + v1t
(30b)

qt = α0 + α1pt + α2Et-1pt + v2t

where the disturbance terms include effects of exogenous variables such as demanders’
income and the price of inputs to production. Here we would hypothesize that β1 < 0 and β2
> 0, to reflect downward sloping demand with respect to the current price and a speculative
demand motive. Also, let α1 ≥ 0 and α2 ≥ 0 to reflect upward sloping supply with respective
to relevant prices. Then the reduced form is
(31)

pt = (α1 − β1)-1 [(β0 − α0) + β2 Et-1pt+1 − (α2 + β2) Et-1pt + v1t − v2t].

15

In terms of equation (25), this specification suggests ζ > 0, γ < 0, and δ = 0. But the first two
of these are just opposite in sign to the requirements for the E&H example. Furthermore, it is
plausible that pt-1 might appear instead of Et-1pt in the supply equation (as in the cobweb
model). But then its coefficient in the reduced form would be negative, and therefore
inconsistent with the d > 0 assumption in the E&H case under discussion.
In sum, I would argue that the specification used most prominently by E&H, to
provide an example featuring the absence of E-stability for the MSV solution, is highly
unappealing in terms of basic economic theory. It must be admitted, however, that this
argument is quite specific and rather ad hoc in nature. Accordingly, I will now turn to a more
general line of argument.
6. Well Formulated Models
In this section I propose conditions necessary for important classes of linear models
to be “well formulated.” Consider again the single-variable specification (14), which is
reproduced once more for convenience:
(32)

yt = α + aEtyt+1 + cyt-1 + ut,

with ut = ρ ut-1 + εt. With εt white noise, ut is an exogenous forcing variable with an
unconditional mean of zero. Applying the unconditional expectation operator to (32) yields
(33)

E yt = α + aEyt+1 + cEyt-1 + 0.

But if yt is covariance stationary, we then have13
(34)

E yt = α / [1− (a + c)].

From the latter, it is clear that as a + c approaches 1.0 from above, the unconditional mean of
yt approaches −∞ (assuming that α > 0), whereas if a + c approaches 1.0 from below, the

16

unconditional mean approaches +∞. Thus there is an infinite discontinuity at a + c = 1.0.
This implies that a tiny change in a + c could alter the average (i.e., steady state) value of yt
from an arbitrarily large positive number to an arbitrarily large negative number. Such a
property is highly implausible and therefore, I suggest, unacceptable for a well-formulated
model.
In light of the preceding discussion, my argument is that, to be considered well
formulated, the model at hand needs to include a restriction on its admissible parameter
values, a restriction that rules out a + c = 1 and yet admits a large open set of values that
includes (a, c) = (0, 0). In the case at hand, the appropriate restriction is a + c < 1. Of course,
a + c > 1 would serve just as well mathematically to avoid the infinite discontinuity, but it is
clear that a + c < 1 is vastly more appropriate from an economic perspective since it includes
the region around (0, 0). Note that the oft-seen condition a + c ≠ 1 does not eliminate the
unacceptable property. It should be clear, in addition, that the foregoing argument could be
easily modified to apply to yt processes that are trend stationary, rather than strictly
(covariance) stationary.14
Now let us consider a second model specification that, like (32), is emphasized by
E&H (1999, 2001). It can be written as
(35)

yt = α + β0 Et-1yt + β1 Et-1yt+1 + δyt-1 + ut,

with ut = ρ ut-1 + εt as before. For this case, consider the conditional expectation, Et-1yt:
(36)

Et-1yt = (1 − β0)-1 [α + β1 Et-1yt+1 + δyt-1 + ρut-1].

13

Note that it is not being assumed that yt is necessarily covariance stationary. Instead, an implication that
would hold, if it were, is being used to motivate the assumption that will be made subsequently.
14
Generalizing, suppose that yt in (32) is a m×1 vector of endogenous variables, so that α is m×1 while a and c
are m×m matrices. Then the counterpart of 1 − (a + c) > 0 is that the eigenvalues of [I − (a + c)] all have
positive real parts, i.e., that the eigenvalues of [a + c] all have real parts less than 1.0 That requirement is
necessary for the multivariate version of (32) to be well formulated.

17

Here it is clear that, for given values of Et-1yt+1, yt-1, and ut-1, Et-1yt will pass through an
infinite discontinuity at β0 = 1. Consequently, for basically the same reason as before, β0 < 1
is necessary for the model to be well formulated. In addition, β0 + β1 + δ < 1 continues to
apply.15
An application of these criteria to the questionable example of E&H (1992), featured
above in Section 5, is immediate. That example’s result, of a MSV solution that is not Estable, requires γ = h > 1. But in the notation of (35), that condition is β0 > 1, which is
incompatible with our requirement for models of form (35) to be well formulated. Thus the
questionable example is discredited on general grounds, in addition to the specific reasons
developed in Section 5.
7. Main Results
We are now prepared to develop a more general version of the foregoing argument.
In particular, it will be shown that being well formulated (henceforth, WF) is a sufficient
condition for the MSV solution to be E-stable in univariate models of classes (32) and (35).
Let us begin with (35), but assuming that δ = 0 since that case has been emphasized by E&H.
For this model, conditions for E-stability can be found by reference to Figure 1, which is
adapted from the diagram of E&H (1999, p. 492; 2001, p. 191). In the cited references, it is
derived and reported that the MSV solution is E-stable in regions I, V, and VI but E-unstable
in regions II, III, and IV. In regions I and VI, moreover, the MSV solution is reported to be

15

The multivariate extension for the case in which yt is a vector yields the requirements that the eigenvalues of
[I −β0] and [ I − (β0 + β1 + δ)] all have positive real parts.

18

strongly E-stable whereas in V it is weakly E-stable.16 Reference to our conditions for model
(35) to be well formulated (with δ = 0) shows immediately that the condition obtains only for
regions I and VI. Thus in this particular but prominent case, the MSV solution is strongly Estable if the parameter values are such that the model is well formulated.
Next consider the more difficult and important model of equation (32). The issue at
hand is whether the MSV solution possesses E-stability, i.e., whether the differential
equations (24) are locally stable at the MSV values for the φj. Necessary and sufficient
conditions for this to be true are given by Evans and Honkapohja (2001, p. 202) as follows:
a(1−aφ1)-1 < 1, ca(1− aφ1)-2 < 1, ρa(1− aφ1)-1 < 1. These will be utilized below, but first it
will be useful to examine Figure 2, which again is adapted from E&H (2001, p. 203). There
E-stability regions are shown under the assumption 0 ≤ ρ < 1. In this case, the results
reported by E&H indicate that the MSV solution is E-stable in regions I and VII but Eunstable in region IV, while “both solutions [i.e., from both roots of (16b)] are explosive or
nonreal” elsewhere (E&H, 2001, p. 203).17 Specifically, solutions for φ1 are complex-valued
in regions III and VI, and both solutions feature explosive behavior in regions II and V. As
indicated above, the MSV solution is well formulated in regions I, V, and VII (being
complex in VI). Thus for regions I and VII, the E&H version of Figure 2 supports the
hypothesis that the MSV solution is E-stable in all well formulated models of form (32). But
what about region V? There the E-stability conditions are in fact met (E&H, 2001, p. 202).
In the E&H graphical summary this region is not distinguished from VI because in V the
solutions are both dynamically unstable (explosive). But there is no compelling reason to
16

Strong E-stability occurs in cases in which local convergence to the MSV parameter values occurs even when
the function considered includes additional variables (excluded from the MSV specification). This implies that
certain other solutions are not E-stable.

19

ignore the MSV solution simply because it is explosive; it may be accurately indicating what
would happen if (e.g.) extremely unwise policy behavior were imposed on the system.18 For
a discussion and rationalization of this position, with a closely related example, see
McCallum (1999). In any case we see that this specification, too, conforms to the
proposition that MSV solutions are E-stable in all well formulated models.19
We wish to have results for the more general case with ρ < 1, permitting negative
values, but let us proceed by first demonstrating algebraically that the E-stability conditions
are satisfied by the MSV solution to model (32) when 0 ≤ ρ < 1 and the WF restriction a + c
< 1 is imposed. Afterwards we can go on to the case with −1 < ρ < 0 permitted. The main
task, then, is to show that if 1− (a + c) > 0, then (1−a φ1 )-1a < 1 where φ1 = (1−d)/2a with d =
1 − 4ac . Note first that 1−a φ1 = (1 + d)/2 so (1−a φ1 )-1a = 2a/(1+d). Then for a proof by
contradiction, suppose that 2a/(1+d) > 1. Then a > 0 and 2a−1 > d. Since both of its sides
are positive, the latter implies 4a2 − 4a + 1 > d2 = 1−4ac. But with a > 0 the last inequality
reduces to a − 1 > −c or 0 > 1− (a + c), which is the contradiction that proves (1−a φ1 )-1a < 1.
The latter is the first of the three E-stability conditions listed in the previous paragraph. The
second results from writing (1−a φ1 )-2a c = (1−a φ 1)-1a φ1 , which follows because (1−a φ1 )-1c =
φ1 .20 Since (1−a φ 1)-1aφ1 = (1−d)/(1+d), which is smaller than 1 for all d > 0, we have the
desired inequality. Finally, with (1−a φ1 )-1a < 1 and ρ non-negative, the third condition also

Note that the MSV solution is the AR(1) solution that E&H (2001) refer to as “ the b− solution.”
The same statement does not apply to region II, where the MSV solution is E-stable but explosive, because
there the model is not well formulated. This region illustrates that, though sufficient, the WF condition is not
necessary for E-stability.
19
The usual presumption that E-stability implies LS learnability does not carry over automatically in cases of
dynamic instability (explosive solutions). E&H (2001, pp. 219-220) indicate, however, that learnability will
17
18

20

holds.
If ρ can be negative, which is plausible, it is possible that a sufficiently large negative
ρ together with (1−a φ1 )-1a < −1 could lead to failure of the last condition. This possibility
can be eliminated, however, by adding a second WF requirement to rule out a different type
of infinite discontinuity. This type pertains to the dynamic response of yt to the exogenous
forcing variable ut. The response coefficient is φ2 = (1 − aφ1 − aρ)-1 so to avoid an infinite
discontinuity we require that 1 − aφ1 − aρ > 0 or 1 − aφ1 > aρ. To see that this condition is
sufficient for our purposes, note that with the MSV solution, 1 − aφ1 = (1 + d)/2 is
unambiguously positive. Consequently, the WF condition 1 − aφ1 > aρ implies that 1 >
(1 − aφ1)-1aρ, which is identical to the E-stability condition under discussion. Thus we have
shown that in model (32) with ρ< 1, the MSV solution is E-stable for all parameter values
satisfying our two WF conditions. 21 22
What about possible E-stability of the non-MSV solutions? A recent analysis that
recognizes not just solutions such as (15) with root (18), but also ones involving “ARMAtype stationary sunspot” phenomena, has recently been conducted by Evans and McGough
(2002). Their finding is that such solutions can be E-stable only in regions equivalent to IV
and VII.23 Whether their results are consistent with the position that non-MSV solutions are
not E-stable or least-squares learnable in model (32)(8) if its parameters satisfy both of our
conditions for being well formulated is unclear. Other relevant results have been provided by
prevail in the current case if an adjustment is made to the model to permit the shock variance to grow along
with the yt values (and ut is white noise).
20
The last expression is just a rearrangement of (16b).
21
A closely related result, more general in some respects but without inclusion of the ut shock term, has been
developed by Gauthier (2003). Also see Wenzelburger (2002), who suggests that some extension to nonlinear
models may be possible.
22
A stronger condition than our second WF requirement, process consistency, is considered in the Appendix.
23
Evans and McGough (2002) do not, however, consider the explosive regions II and V.

21

Desgranges and Gauthier (2002).
Clearly, the main weakness of the foregoing argument is that the results pertain only
to univariate models. It is my conjecture that the results can be extended to rather general
multivariate linear formulations, but this extension has not yet been verified.
8. Conclusions
Let us conclude with a brief restatement of the paper’s results. After some historical
discussion of the RE solution procedures of Walters (1971), Muth (1961), and Lucas
(1972b), this paper considers the relevance for actual economies of issues stemming from the
existence of multiple RE equilibria. In all linear models, the minimum state variable (MSV)
solution—as defined by McCallum (1983, 1999)—is unique by construction. While it might
be argued that the MSV solution warrants special status as the (unique) bubble-free solution,
the focus in the present paper is on its adaptive, least-squares learnability by individuals not
initially endowed with full knowledge of the economy’s parameters, as discussed in
important recent publications by Evans and Honkapohja (1999, 2001).
Although the MSV solution is learnable and the main alternatives are not learnable in
most standard models, Evans and Honkapohja (1992, 1999, 2001) have stressed an example
in which the opposite is true. The present paper shows, however, that parameter values
yielding that result are such that the model is not well formulated, in a specified sense (one
that avoids implausible discontinuities). More generally, analysis of a pair of prominent
univariate specifications, featured by Evans and Honkapohja, shows that the MSV solution is
invariably learnable in these structures, if they are well formulated.

22

Appendix
Because of the possibility that −1 < ρ < 0, we have ruled out a second type of infinite
discontinuity, pertaining to the dynamic response of yt to the exogenous forcing variable ut,
by requiring that 1 − aφ1 − aρ > 0. For the MSV solution, 1 − aφ1= (1+d)/2 so we need
1 + d − 2aρ > 0, or d > 2aρ − 1, to avoid the discontinuity. Clearly there is no problem unless
2aρ > 1 (so a < 0). If it is, the relevant condition may be written (since d = 1 − 4ac ) as
1 − 4ac > 1 − 4aρ + 4a2ρ2 or − 4ac > − 4aρ + 4a2ρ2 or, with a < 0, −c < aρ2 − ρ. Now for
the latter to hold for all ρ such that −1 < ρ < 0, it is necessary and sufficient that a + c > −1.
That requirement is stronger, however, than the one adopted in this paper.
For the stronger condition, an alternative and more general argument can be based on
the concept of “process consistency,” discussed by Flood and Garber (1980), McCallum
(1983, pp. 159-160), and Evans and Honkapohja (1992, pp. 10-12). A model fails to be
process consistent when solving out expectational variables, by iteration into the infinite
future, is illegitimate because the implied infinite series does not converge.24 For model
(32)(8) to be process consistent, then, it must be the case that at least one of the roots to (16b)
exceeds 1.0 in absolute value. Thus process consistency obtains in region V of Figure 2, but
not in region VII, according to the root properties reported by E&H (2001, p. 203).
Requiring process consistency is therefore consistent with our main result but rules out some
MSV solutions that are E-stable and permitted by the weaker condition adopted in Section 7.

24

An extensive discussion of related issues is given by Sargent (1987, pp. 176-204 and 305-308).
