    "abstract": "\n\nWorkers\u2019 social identity affects their occupation, and therefore the structure and prosperity of the aggregate economy. We estimate a general equilibrium Roy model of this phenomenon in the Indian caste system, where work and identity are particularly intertwined. New data on occupation, wages, and caste\u2019s traditional occupations and social status show that workers are over-represented in their traditional occupations and under-represented in socially higher or lower occupations. We consider counterfactuals removing castes\u2019 hierarchical and occupational links. Despite more efficient human capital allocation, aggregate output gains are small\u2013in some counterfactuals negative\u2013due to weaker caste networks and reduced learning across generations.\n\n",
