Growth and External Debt Under
Risk of Debt Repudiation

ABSTRACT

We analyze the pattern of growth of a nation which borrows abroad and which

has the option of repudiating its foreign debt. We show that the equilibrium
strategy of competitive lenders is to make the growth of the foreign debt

contingent on the growth of the borrowing country. We give a closed-form
solution to a linear version of our model. The economy, in that case, follows a
two-stage pattern of growth. During the first stage, the debt grows more
rapidly than the economy. During the second stage, both the debt and the
economy grow at the same rate1 and more slowly than in the first stage. During
this second stage, the total interest falling due on the debt is never entirely
repaid; only an amount proportional to the difference of the rate of interest
and the rate of growth of the economy is repaid each period.

Introduction

When borrowers have an option to repudiate their debts, the interactions of
borrowers and lenders over time presents a strategic situation of enormous

complexity. Consider the case of a sovereign borrowing country, raising loans
from the world capital market. Following Eaton and Gersovitz (1981), suppose
that repudiation of the debt results in financial autarky and a loss of

productive efficiency of the defaulting country. An indebted country must
balance these costs with the direct costs of debt repayment, in considering the

option of repudiation. In turn, credit rationing will emerge from the lenders'
decision to limit their exposure to a level low enough to render debt
repudiation an inferior option to the borrowing country.

It turns out that the lenders' strategy is not easy to compute. The simple
maxim is to lend freely to the point where the country is indifferent between

debt repayment and repudiation. But what point is that? One of the incentives
for debt repayment is the option to borrow again in the future. But the value
of that option depends on how much lenders will lend -in the future. That -in

turn will depend on the future lenders' assessment of the point of indifference
of the country between repayment and repudiation, which in turn will depend on

the capacity of the country to borrow in the still further distant future. Thus
we have a problem of infinite regress, and the method of dynamic programming is
needed to solve the lenders' problem.
In this paper, we examine a growth model -in which sufficiently many

linearities allow us to give a closed form solution to the lender's and

borrower's strategies. We also describe an algorithm and a suitable numerical

—2—

technique to solve for borrower and lender behavior in more complex, non-linear

settings. In the analytical version of the model, the borrowing country goes
through two borrowing stages:

(1) a stage with unconstrained borrowing and a

rising external-debt-to-GDP ratio, with the rate of GOP growth falling
progressively; and (2) a stage with a constant, low rate of GOP growth and

constrained (rationed) borrowing. During the second stage (which always occurs
after a finite time), the country never repays the full amount of interest
falling due but only the fraction which is necessary to make the debt grow at
the same rate as the GOP of the country.

Section 2 sets out the model. Section 3 analyzes the optimal lending
strategy when default is an available alternative to the borrower, and presents

analytical results in the linear version of the model. Section 4 briefly
discusses the use of numerical techniques for more general models. Finally,
section 5 examines the sensitivity of the equilibrium to alternative lending

strategies. A conclusion summarizes the paper. All technical derivations are
presented in four appendixes.

2.

The Model

We study a discrete-time growth model of a small country which has access

to an international capital market. We assume that the consumption, investment
and borrowing decisions are made by a social planner maximizing an intertemporal

utility function. The numeraire (both national and international) is a good
which serves for both consumption and investment. The international rate of
interest is assumed to be a constant, r. In this paper we do not deal with

—3—

the important distinction between traded and non-traded goods. This will enable
us to use GOP as a measure of the potential foreign-exchange revenues of the

country. In a more general framework, one should be careful to use the
production of traded goods as the measure of the revenues which enable the
country to repay its debt (see Cooper and Sachs (1984) and Oornbusch (1983)).

a.

Technology and Capital Installation
The technology available to the country is described by a linear production

function with only one input, capital:

=

(1)

aK

is GOP at time t, and Kt installed capital.

(In section 4, we briefly

examine the case of more general technologies.) Installed capital depreciates
at rate d, so that the net increment to installed capital is:

(2) Kt+i =

+ (1_d)Kt

where I is the flow of newly installed capital. If there were no installation
costs, a social planner able to borrow at a world interest rate r would choose
either to invest or disinvest at an infinite rate depending on whether r is
less than or greater than a -

(3)

d.

In what follows, we shall assume the inequality

r<a—d

so that the planner would choose to invest at an infinite rate. in fact, we
shall also assume that installation of capital is costly. Following Abel and

—4—

Hayashi, we let J, total investment expenditure, and I, the flow of new
installed capital, be related by the functional form
(4)

=

[1

+

The unit cost to install capital is therefore (1/2)(It/Kt). which increases
with the rate of capital accumulation. With this formulation, the planner will
always choose to invest at a finite rate.

b.

The Wealth of the Country

We shall define the productive wealth W of the country as the discounted
value of current and future production net of the investment expenditure, using
the world interest rate as the discount factor:
(5)

Wt =

=t(14T)(t)(aKi_Ji)

It is easy to show (see Appendix 2, equations (A2.5) to (A2.1O)) that the wealth
so defined is maximized by selecting a fixed rate of capital accumulation

(6)

x* =

It/Kt

Capital stock growth is then given by;

(7)

From now on, we shall assume that the value of g* satisfies g* c r so that the

infinite sum in (5) is meaningful. We show in Appendix 2 (A2.9) that the value

x* maximizing W and satisfying (3) is
(8)

x* =

(r+d)[1

-

Yt

—

(2/4)(a-d-r)/(r+d))

This value of x exists under the condition

—5.-

(9)

$ > 2(a—d—r)/(r÷d)

(9) says that installation cost must be sufficiently large so as to make the

maximum rate of capital accumulation lower than the rate of interest. We
henceforth assume that (9) holds.

c.

Optimizing Behavior of the Country
We shall assume that the country is governed by a social planner maximizing

a time—separable utility function of the form
(10)

U =

The choice of logarithmic utility helps to preserve key linearities necessary
for a closed-form-solution.

When the constraint on foreign borrowing is not binding, the optimal

consumption path will satisfy

(11)

C,÷1/C =

(1+r)

From now on we shall assume

(12)

$(1+r) -c I +

which guarantees that the planner discounts the future sufficiently to desire to
be a net borrower.

d.

Foreign Borrowing

The international capital market is assumed to be competitive, and to
supply loans at a fixed interest rate r (though in a rationed quantity, yet to

-6-

be determined). All loans are for one period, with Dt denoting the principal

repayments due at time t, and rD the interest payments due at time t. The
balance of payments equation is:

=

—

general, as described in Section 3, new borrowing will be limited by a

constraint of the form

h(K1). The goal is to characterize the h(Kt÷i)

function, and to study optimal borrowing under that constraint.

d.

The Threat of Repudiation
We shall assume that the planner has the option of repudiating the

country's external debt. If it does so, it suffers two penalties. First, the
country permanently loses its access to international capital markets so that it

is forced into financial autarky. Second, there is a direct penalty on
production following debt repudiation (due, for example, to a loss of efficiency
following increased difficulties in foreign trade) so that the productivity of

capital becomes a(1—A) for some Xe[O,1). GDP hence becomes

(14)

=

a(1—A)K

Given these constraints, a defaulting country can reach an autarkic

intertemporal utility level, which we name vD(Kt). Note that this utility level
is a function of the stock of capital in place when the decision to default is

taken. We show in Appendix 1, equation (A1.8), that V°(Kt) is of the form:

(15)

VD(Kt) =

log(Kt)/(1_$)

+

Constant

-.7—

The constant term is a decreasing function of A. We shall assume full
information of both creditors and debtors of the value of A, as well as of the

level of the capital stock. Given this absence of uncertainty, default will
never happen: the lenders will select a supply of credit such that the borrower

will never find it profitable to repudiate its debt. The main purpose of
Section 3 will be to find this loan supply and to derive its consequences for
the growth of the country.

3.

Equilibrium with Repudiation

We now examine the consequences of a threat of debt repudiation on the
strategies available to the lenders, and on the rate of growth of the borrowing

economy. At each point of time, the country has built up both external debt and
productive capital. In order to decide whether to default or to repay the debt
coming due, the country has to compare the autarkic utility level V0(K), which
is a function of installed capital only, with the utility it can derive by

servicing the debt and at least postponing the decision to default. The
subtlety of the problem is that the country's decision depends in part on the
future credit lines it expects from the lenders, who must relate their l!nding

decisions to the country's present and future choices. Technically, the
solution must be obtained by backward recursion. Given the constraints on
lending that the country is expected to face in the future, present lenders must
keep their exposure to a level which keeps the country from defaulting an its
current debt.

Solving the problem in its full generality is a hard task and

—8-

simpi-ifications are needed to find a closed form solution. An example is solved
in Eaton and Gersowitz by assuming a fixed cyclical pattern to the country's

output, and no capital accumulation. In our previous work (1984, 1985), a
three-period horizon allowed us to solve a model with uncertainty via backward

recursion. In the model here, the many linearities which we imposed on consumer
tastes and on production technology enable us to give a closed—form solution to

the problem in an infinite-horizon model with capital accumulation. Before we
solve our specific model, we first set the problem in its general form.

a.

Finitely-Lived Economy
In order to show how backward recursion is used to find the optimal

decision rule of the lenders, we first assume that the horizon of the country
ends at some finite time 1.

Let us assume that the country has not defaulted before the last period and
that it has accumulated by then a capital stock Kr and an external debt D1 (with

debt D1, the country owes (i+r)D in the last period). During the last period,
the decision to repay or to default is straightforward since the country has

only to compare the costs and benefits of defaulting in one period. We define
(following Eaton and Gersovitz (1981))

(16)

VT(KT.OT) =

max{V(K1,D).

We assume

that when repudiation andrepayment yield exactly the same utility (i.e.

the country repays the debt. Let us call hT(

) the lending limit which keeps

the country from defaulting at 1. h1 is defined implicitly by the condition:

V(KTVDT) )

h1(K.1.) <=>

From (17) and (18), hT is simply:
(19)

hT(KT) =

XaKT/(1+r)

Thus, the country will repay DT if and only if DT

h1(K1) = XaK1/(1+r).

Let us now analyze the problem at time 1-1. We define 41(DT 11K1

V1(K11JD11) is the utility that the country can reach by repaying the debt,
when it faces a new supply of credit which is constrained py D.,.

Let us finally define:

(21)

VT1(DT1IKT1) = max (Vl(KTltDTl)i v°(K,)}

h1(K1).

-10—

with Vl(KT_l) the utility level that the country can reach by defaulting on the
debt

VT_I is the best outcome that the country can reach at time t given its

ability to repudiate the debt. We now define h11(

)

as the rule which will

keep the country from defaulting at time 1-1. We want:
(22)

01_i

hTl(KT1) <> VT1(KTlIOTi)

By backward recursion, we can clearly define a sequence of lending rules
{h1( ).hTi( ),...,h0( )}

such that (22) holds for all t

1, and v, vD, and Vt

defined analogously to the expressions in (20) and (21). Equation (22), when
generalized for all t, is the condition for the country to repay its debt
0 falling due at time t when it expects at time t,. . . ,T, the lending rules

It is interesting to consider the case when X = 1, i.e. when all output is

lost in the event of default. In this case, a default at time t results in C
= 0 for all i

0. Thus, A = 1 is tantamount to assuming that the country has

no option to repudiate. It is easy to see that the planner will always choose
to service the debt as long as it is feasible to pay (1+r)O out of net exports
at time t plus new borrowing. At 1-1, therefore, lenders limit loans D.. such

or, using earlier notation:

(24)

To sum up, when A =

1,

borrowing is limited only by the maximum productive

wealth of the economy.

b.

A Digression on the Precommitment of Capital Installation
In the maximization problem which we set in (20), we implicitly assumed

that the investment and borrowing decisions are made simultaneously, since the
lenders at time t can condition their loans on the investment decision of the

country. The loan at time t,

is therefore made a function of the capital

stock that will be in place at time t+1.
before

If the lending decision must be made

is observed, there is a moral hazard problem. The country, even if it

wishes to precommit itself to investing a certain amount I in light of the
borrowing constraint Dt+j

ht+i(K+i). may find it profitable not to do so

after after the loan has been granted. In such situations, the lending strategy
by the banks should be written

Dt 4 ht(Kti)
and the borrower will typically reach a lower level of utility because of this

lagged relationship. In all that follows, we shall ignore this problem by
assuming that the loan can be predicated on the investment decision each period.
We refer the reader to our previous work (1984) for further discussion.

-12-

c.

Infinite-Horizon Economies

When one lets the time horizon of the economy go to infinity, the
definition of the lending rule remains the same except that the time subscript

may be dropped, since h(Kt) will be the same for all t. An equilibrium will be
defined by the four functions vD(Kt), VR(Kt,Dt), V(Kt,Dt) and h(Kt). such that:
(25)

VR(Dt,Kt;h(

[logCt + $V(D+iKt+j;h( ))]

subject to (2), (4), (13) and

4 h(Kti)

V(DtiKt) = max{VR( v )}
4 h(K1) <> VR(Kt,Dt;h( ))
h( )

is

V0(K)

therefore a stationary rule such that if future lenders are to apply it

as a criterion for future lending, it will also be used as a criterion for
current lending.

Before proceeding to the specific solution for V0. yR. and h in the case

of A < 1, it is useful to make one small amendment to (25). Though
log C, +

equals

and V1 = max (V11V÷1), the lending constraint

h(Kt+i) guarantees that V1

as long as the debt is repaid at time t.

other words, as long as the debt is repaid once, borrowing constraints will
guarantee that all future debts will also be repaid (this is true only in a

model without uncertainty). Therefore, yR in (25) will also satisfy:

(25')

where

vR(ot,Kt) = max[loC + $VR(Otl,Ktl)]
replaces V on the right hand side.

One case of (25) is easily solved: for A = 1. As noted earlier,
(1+r)0± will always be repaid as long as repayment is feasible out of net

and new borrowing Dt+i. i.e. as long as (1+r)D max

(aK_J+D+1). Of course,

is limited by Dt÷i ( h(Kt+i). Thus, the

borrowing constraint is defined by a stationary h function, such that h(K) =

[max(axt_Jt+Dt+i)J/(1+r),
have h(Kt) =

with

h(K41). Upon substitution, for Dt+i w

max[aKt_Jt+h(Kt+i)]/(1+r).

The solution to this functional

equation is:
(26)

h(K) = max(y7_t(1+r)_(1_t)(aK._J4]/(1+r) = max
W/(1+r)

Thus, as in the case of finite 1, the borrowing constraint when A =

1

is simply

that D(1+r) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of national
productive wealth.

For A =1, the problem in (24) reduces to the standard borrowing problem
without repudiation risk:
(27)

subject to (2), (4), (13), and for all t,

D(l+r)
and

maxy_t(aKi_Ji)(1+r)_(1_t)

It is a standard exercise to how under these circumstances that the
optimal production decision and the consumption choice can be separated. Given
the international rate of interest, investment is chosen to maximize the

productive wealth of the country. Given the path of productive wealth, the
planner theli selects an optimal pattern of consumption, subject only to the
constraint that

max W is satisfied. We show in Appendix 3 that the

equilibrium will be characterized by the two following conditions:

—14—

Proposition 1: When A= I (i.e. the country can never profitably
repudiate its debt)

1)

GOP grows at the fixed rate 9* (equation (8)) which maximizes
productive wealth

2)

Consumption grows at a rate 0 =

(1+r)

—

1.

The initial value of consumption is defined so that the discounted value of
the infinite sequence of consumption is equal to the wealth of the country.
Under the assumption (12), consumption over GOP tends to zero in the

stationary state. This says that in the long run all GOP goes to repayment of
the debt. When the country has the option to repudiate its debt, even at a
substantial loss, a path in which consumption

asymptotically approaches zero as

a fraction of GOP can never be an equilibrium, since the

option to repudiate

would eventually be exercised. Lenders will restrain their lending so that in
the limit only a fraction of GOP goes to the repayment of the debt, and so that
consumption does not tend to zero in the long run.
One additional feature of the equilibrium is the

following. The productive

wealth of the economy W is maximized by the investment path, and it grows at
the same rate as GDP, i.e. at the rate g*. Since g* C r (by our earlier
assumptions on the technology parameters), and since

(1+r)O W by the lending

rule, we see that O must grow less rapidly than rate r in the long run.
Therefore, the path of (1+r)O satisfies the so'-called
condition":

"transversality

Then,: taking limits and

applying the transversality condition, we have:
(30)

(1+r)D0 =

17..0(1+r)RPi

In effect, the transversality condition is a zero—profit condition for the
sequence of loans:

it guarantees that the discounted alue of repayments equals

the outstanding debt payment due at time t, (1+r)D.
We have found the transversality condition to.be implied by the market

equilibrium. If lenders expect (1+r)D+1 W for all I > 0, they will impose
(1+r)O÷1 (

in period t.

In some models, the transversality

condition need not be an implication of market equilibrium (see Cohen and Sachs
(1985) as an example). Later in this paper, -in Sectiob 4, we will need to
impose the zero-profit condition (30) directly, rather: than finding it as an
implication of the model.

d.

Market Equilibrium with Repudiation Risk
We now turn to the case of A < 1, and show that the lending rule h(Kt) is

linear in Kt. The equilibrium path, when A <
proposition:

1

is described by the following

-16-

Proposition 2: Lending in each period is governed by a linear credit
constraint:

(31)

h*K
where h* is a constant which depends both on the technology of production

and on the taste parameters of the intertemporal utility function. Given
this constraint, a country with no initial debt selects a path with two
stages:

Stage 1: The constraint (31) on the debt is not binding. The rate of
growth of the economy is high initially, and declines progressively, and
the debt—to-GDP and debt—to-capital ratios increase.

Stage 2: The constraint on the debt is binding, the economy and the debt
grow at a same rate n, which is lower than the growth rates in Stage I
and below the rate of growth, g*, which maximizes productive wealth.

According to Proposition 2, the threat of repudiation forces the economy
into an equilibrium with productive inefficiency, since the rate of growth in

stage 2 is below the level g* which maximizes productive wealth. With debt
=

growing at rate n1 we have

(1+n)Dt.

Also,

RPt is the amount of repayment at time t. Thus, RPt =
(32)

RPt =

with

e =

(1+r)D - RPt. where

(r—n)D.

or:

(r-n)h*/a

One sees that the repayment is always less than the amount of interest falling

due, rD. so that the lenders always refinance some interest payments. Despite

—17—

this property, the discounted value of debt repaymentsequals (1+r)O, i.e., the
zero profit condition in (3) holds. (We know this to be true, since with debt
growing at rate n <

r,

the transvérsality condition in (28) is satisfied.)

Once the binding debt-to-capital ratio, h*, has been reached, the only way

the lenderscan keep the country from defaulting is tocontinue to lend
according to the sane rule. If they cease to do so, and demand, for
example, the repayment of all interest falling due, then the country will

default. (Proof: The rule 0* ( h*K, when it is binding, leads by construction
to

= yR. Any tighter lending rule will then have V0 >

R,

and the country

will default.)

The proof of Proposition 2 is given in Appendix 3. Here we sketch the main
steps of the proof. First, we guess a function for hOC) and solve the optimal
borrowing problem under the constraint

h(K), assuming no debt repudiation.

The optimal borrowing problem yields an optimal consumption plan, denoted
where the superscript R

stresses

the dependence of the optimal plan on the

assumed borrowing constraint. We then define the value of the optimal program
(under Fi)

as v'(KtDt) = rsa t1log (C11). By construction, vh satisfies

the equation (25'): Vh(Kt,Dt) = max log(C) +
'

only if vhl(Kt,ut)

Then, we prove for our

Vh(Kt+l,Ot+l)
(
choice h that

such that

h(Kt÷1) if and

V(IC). Thus, we have found a solution to (25), with

yR = vi', h = h, and V0 = V0. Using

we then prove the part of the

proposition concerning the two-stage growth path.

Specifically, we prove that the linear credit rule in (31) satisfies the

market equilibrium in (25). The properties of the borrowing equilibrium under

—18—

Dt

h*Kt are easy to calculate, a shown in Appendix 3. We solve the optimal

control problem for foreign borrowing subject to the constraint that O.

h*Kt.

The result is the two—stage growth process described in Proposition 2. Starting
U0 =

0, there is an initial period of rapid but declining growth, with D/K

rising to h*. Once the constraint is binding, 0/K remains equal to h*, and
growth remains equal to xh*, where xM is the root of equation (A3.8) in
Appendix 3. This growth rate is less than g*, the grovth rate that maximizes
(Remember that g is achieved when A = 1, i.e. when there is no viable
threat of repudiation.)
In Appendix 3, we present the non-linear equation (A3.12) that defines h*.

It is straightforward to show that h* is: increasing in a, , and A; and is
decreasing in r.

In words, the sustainable debt per unit of capital rises with

capital productivity, the discount factor, and the penalty for default, while it

falls with the world interest rate. By a simple transformation, the maximum
debt-GNP ratio is a similar function of these variables, since D/GNP =

O/(aK-rD),

whidh must be less than or equal to h/(a-rh) when U ( HK. In Table 1, we
calculate the maximum debt—GNP ratios for alternative values of a, , A, and r.
It is also instructive to compare the equilibrium growth paths for GOP

under alternative borrowing assumptions, as is done in Figure 1. The dashed
line, which increases most rapidly, is for GOP in the absence of repudiation
risk (i.e. for A =

1);

the solid line, which shows intermediate growth, is for

GOP with repudiation risk (specifically, A =

0.4),

notable aspects of the figure. First, it is apparent that productive-wealth
is reduced by the option to repudiate. Second, we see the point of inflection
(in period 17) in the intermediate growth path, which according to Proposition 2
is reached when the constraint Dt

We have been able to derive a closed—form solution for the growth path in

Once the linear production technology is abandoned, an analytical solution

appears out of reach. Now, a rise in K is more than a scale change, since
output does not (by assumption) rise in the same proportion. For a standard

neoclassical production technology, Q

In other words, the h function giving Ut

h(K) will be less than unit elastic in Kt.

—20-

In order to investigate this case, we resort to numerical dynamic

programing methods (designed by Mr. Atish Ghosh in conjunction with the
authors). Specifically, the value function V°(Kt) is calculated numerically for

a grid on Kt varying between 0 and 10.0, with steps of 0.1. Then, v(Kt,n) is
calculated using the backward recursion methodology outlined in Section 3. The
function is analyzed on a grid of 0 to 10.0 for Kt. and 0 to 2.0 for IJ., both

with step sizes of 0.1. Once

as in section 3, the optimization in (20) is carried out by a numerical search

procedure over I and C, using step sizes of 0.05 for these variables. The
and

backward recursion procedure is repeated until

steady—state functions within the specified tolerance.

could be achieved by a finer grid size, but at the cost of much higher computing

time.)1 In the linear case, of course, this maximum ratio is a constant (h*/a),
independent of the level of GOP. In the case of Cobb—Douglas technology,
however, the maximum ratio declines as GDP increases. This is for a
straightforward, yet illuminating reason. At low levels of GOP, the marginal

productivity of capital is very high and the investment incentives are

consequently strong. The returns to borrowing abroad are large, as are the
costs of debt repudiation (which would freeze out new borrowing to finance

further increases in K). As the capital stock deepens, the incremental returns
to investment fall, and the costs of debt repudiation as a fraction of GOP are

reduced pan passu. Thus, a capital—poor country will be allowed a wide
latitude in foreign borrowing, while a capital—abundant economy will be much

more restricted (as a proportion of GDP). The allowable debt rises as GOP rises
but less than proportionately.

As shown in Figures 3 and 4, this feature of the h( )

function

has

important implications for the growth path and for foreign borrowing. As in the
linear model, growth and foreign borrowing start out high and then fall sharply

as the debt constraint is hit (in this case as of period 2). Figure 3 shows the
GDP growth rate and the current account deficit as a percentage of GOP.
Figure 4 shows the actual and maximum debt/GOP ratios for periods 1 through 15.
In each period, the maximum rate is calculated as h(Kt)/GDPt where Kt is the

level of Kt on the equilibrium growth path. In the first period, actual
Dt/GDPt <

h(K)/GDP.

In periods 2 thorugh 15, the debt constraint is binding

as shown. Note that the Debt/GOP ratio jumps sharply between periods 1 and 2,
and then declines over, as the country becomes wealthier (i.e. as the capital

stock deepens). The decline reflects the already observed fact that
h(Kt)/GOPt is a declining function of Kt.

Alternative Lendinn StrateQies
In this section we return to the linear version of the model in order to

examine lending and repayment strategies which differ from the market

equilibrium described above. In the first subsection, we assume that the
lenders and the borrower can act cooperatively to decide upon a path of future
debt, consumption and investment, subject only to the zero profit condition in
(3) and to the condition that the country keep its sovereign right to repudiate
the debt at any time and to suffer the penalty thereafter.

(If the country can

also credibly promise never to repudiate, it reaches the equilibrium of

Proposition 1.) Is there any contractual scheme between the lenders and the
borrowers that can dominate the market equilibrium and still keep the country

from defaulting? The answer is no, as we show in the proof of Proposition 3.
In the second subsection, we analyze a repayment scheme which has been

suggested by some analysts. We have seen that when

=

h*Kt,

in stage 2 of the

market equilibrium, the country repays every period a fixed fraction e of GOP,

as in (32). What if the lenders simply demand that RPt =

It turns out that when the borrower expects to

a.

Contractual Agreements Between the Lenders and the Borrower
In this subsection, we assume that the borrowing country and its lenders

can design a path of future debt, investment and consumption such that:

(i) the loan satisfies the zero—profit conditon (30); and (ii) the country
never finds it profitable to repudiate its debt. The path is set once and for

all at t =

Surprisingly, such a contractual arrangement cannot dominate the

market equilibrium:

Proposition 3: The market equilibrium yields the optimal pattern of
growth that a country can reach, subject to the constraint that it never
prefers to default.

The proposition says, among other things, that there is no way to avoid the

slowdown of growth described in Proposition 2. This slowdown is an inherent
implication of the option of repudiation; there is no way that the country can
credibly promise to grow at 9* forever.

To prove Proposition 3, we first define the new utility function Q which
would be attained if the country can design in advance its path of consumption
and investment subject to (3) and the constraint that it never prefer to
default.

transversality condition (16).

Note that (34) guarantees that the country will never choose to repudiate the

debt. A priori, Q does not coincide with the utility V achieved in the market

equilibrium. V was defined as the fixed point of problem (25). Q is defined

—24—

directly by an optimizing problem. They in fact are equal, as we show in
Appendix 4. the crux of the argument is to show that inequality (34) can be
written O.,

b.

h*K, as -in the market equilibrium case.

Repayment of a Fixed Fraction of the Revenues Each Period
Let us assume that the country has already entered stage 2 of its pattern

of growth. Each period, it repays a fixed fraction of its revenues to the
lenders in order to equalize the growth of debt and the growth of GOP. These
repayments can be written RPt =

((r_n)h*/a]Q,

with n =

21*

-

d, where

xM is the investment rate in Stage 2.
Now, let us assume that the lenders ask to be repaid some fraction é
GOP, instead of sticking to the original rule of lending 0

of

-

h*K. B may or may

not equal (r_n)h*/a. We prove the following:
Proposition 4: When a country has reached the stage 2 of its pattern of
growth, the lenders cannot get repayment of their loans by abandoning the
rule

h*K and by asking instead to be repaid a fixed fraction of the

country's GDP each period. By doing so, they would either induce the
country to default, or they would get repayment of only a portion of the
outstanding debt (i.e. the zero profit condition in (3) would not hold).

The proposition stresses the importance to the creditors of stating

correctly the rule governing their lending. In the market equilibrium, the
lenders are ready to increase their exposure at the rate of GDP growth. By
doing so, they create an incentive for the country to grow. Any slight

-25-

modification of the rule which reduces this incentive to grow yields a

sub-optimal result. A repayment scheme as in Proposition 4 creates an incentive
that is adverse to growth, since debt repayments are made an increasing function
of the output of the economy.

To prove Proposition 4, assume that the country is asked to repay a fixed
fraction ö

of

its GDP. It will select an optimal rate of growth by

solving:

If

the creditors are to be repaid, the borrower is driven below the autarky level.

Conclusion

We have constructed a model with endogenous growth and endogenous credit

ceilings. We have shown that the equilibrium path for the country is one with
initially rapid growth followed by a permanent slowdown. The equilibrium
strategy of the lenders makes the growth of debt contingent on the growth of the

borrowing country. In the linear version of our model, under the equilibrium
lending rule, the evolution of the debt follows two stages, a first stage in
which debt grows faster than the economy, and a second stage where both the

economy and the debt grow more slowly, and at the same rate. Along this path,
the interest due, rD, is never repaid in full; only an amount equal to the
difference between the interest due and g*D (the growth rate times the debt)

should be repaid. This permanent refinancing of part of the interest is the
only way to reach the optimum pattern of growth consistent with no default by
the borrowing country.

need to include Kt+i =

longer any real dynamic constraints in the problem, so that we need only to

This inequality can be derived directly from equation (#3.8). Another way is
as follows. Equation (#3.8) can be derived from
(#3.15)

Maximize vh(l,h)

(43.15) says that x1 maximizes the utility which is reached when the constraint

on the debt is binding. The first order condition (using the definition of
in equation (43.11)) yields:
(#3.16)

(1+4x-h)(1+x—d)(1—) = $[h(x—r-d)

+ a —

x(1+4x/2)]

The RHS is positive (it measures consumption per unit of capital). Therefore,
(1+$x—h)(1+x—d)(1—$) is positive, so that (#3.14) follows. (A3.16), when
developed, yields (#3.8).

Two—staged Growth

describe explicitly the optimal pattern of growth. From equations (A3.7), we

that the dynamics of the system can simply be written

All that we need in order to find the entire sequence {x} is the value x1_1 and
to define the sequence {xt}t<T_2 by backward application to equation (43.18).

The argument is as in Appendix 3.

If (C,Ij is an optimal solution to

Q(D0,K0), {xc1xIJ is an optimal solution to

Q(AD01AK0).

Step 2
In the constraint (34), we can write (O5,K) in place of

log c

The proof uses a standard argument of dynamic programming. If the RHS did not
coincide with U (which is the maximum one can reach at time s), then one could
increase Q(00,K0) by changing (C..,I}> to the solution {cI!>, which

maximizes Q(DiK5). Clearly this change would not violate inequality (34).
