    "abstract": "\n\nMotivated by growing concerns about the risks and instability of China\u2019s financial system, this article reviews several commonly perceived financial risks and discusses their roots in China\u2019s politico-economic institutions. We emphasize the need to evaluate these risks within China\u2019s unique economic and financial systems, in which the state and non-state sectors coexist and the financial system serves as a key tool of the government to fund its economic policies. Overall, we argue that: (1) financial crisis is unlikely to happen in the near future, and (2) the ultimate risk lies with China\u2019s economic growth, as a vicious circle of distortions in the financial system lowers the efficiency of capital allocation and economic growth and will eventually exacerbate financial risks in the long run.\n\n",
