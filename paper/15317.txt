ABSTRACT
Portfolio performance in 401(k) plans depends on both the investment menu made available by plan
sponsors and participants portfolio decisions. We use a unique dataset of nearly 1 million participants
in one thousand pension plans to identify key portfolio inefficiencies in 401(k) plans,attributing them
either to the sponsor’s menu design or to participants’ own portfolio choices. We show that most sponsors
offer efficient investment menus. However, many participants fail to construct efficient portfolios,
leading to retirement wealth that could be one-fifth lower due to poor portfolio decisions. Because
participants are the main source of inefficient DC portfolio choices, strategies targeting their portfolio
choices, such as improved default investment strategies or advice programs, may help. Also, in sponsors’
design of 401(k) menus, the number of options offered is less important than the range of funds provided.

The Efficiency of Sponsor and Participant
Portfolios Choices in 401(k) Plans
Ning Tang, Olivia S. Mitchell, Gary R, Mottola, and Stephen P. Utkus

With the growing numbers of investors and assets in 401(k) plans, as well as their
increasingly prominent role in the financing of retirement,1 renewed attention has turned to the
question of whether 401(k) portfolios are efficient. All else equal, for a given level of risk and
return, better diversified portfolios would be expected to yield more retirement wealth than
poorly diversified holdings. As a result, the question of how well these assets are invested is of
substantial interest to policymakers and plan sponsors who oversee the system, as well as
participants who anticipate using these resources as a source of income in retirement.
Portfolio performance in 401(k) plans depends on two factors: the choice of investment
menu by plan sponsors, and the investment choices made by participants. Previous work has
suggested that a large number of plan menus may be inefficient, reducing long-term wealth
accumulation by around half (Elton, Gruber, and Blake or hereafter EGB, 2006; Angus, Brown,
Smith, and Smith, 2007). But those conclusions may be questions due to their reliance on small
and specialized datasets.
At same time, several studies have highlighted the behavioral biases and financial literacy
constraints that appear to hinder participant decision-making. Some plan participants appear to
use naive allocation strategies (Benartzi and Thaler, 2001; Agnew, 2002); others exhibit inertia
in asset allocation and rebalancing (Ameriks and Zeldes, 2004; Agnew, Balduzzi, and Sunden,
2003); and still others are subject to framing and default effects in investment choices (Benartzi

Private-sector DC retirement programs covered over 50 million active participants and held assets over $2 trillion
as of 2008 (ICI, 2009). DC plans are expected to be the primary source of retirement funding for a substantial
fraction of future U.S. retirees (Poterba, Venti and Wise, 2007).

and Thaler, 2002, Karlsson, Massa, and Simonov, 2007). Plan participants also display low
levels of financial literacy and investment savvy (Hancock, 2002, Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007;
Van Rooij, Kool and Prast, 2007); build poorly diversified portfolios (Mottola and Utkus, 2008);
overinvest in company stock (Liang and Weisbenner, 2002; Huberman and Sengmueller, 2004;
Benartzi, Thaler, Utkus and Sunstein, 2007); and follow their peers (Duflo and Saez, 2002). In
previous work, we have also found that excessive trading in 401(k) plans is costly (Yamaguchi,
Mitchell, Mottola, and Utkus, 2006).2 Despite this inventory of possible decision-making errors,
few of these studies have attempted to quantify the extent of efficiency losses in the 401(k)
context.
This paper distinguishes efficiency losses arising from the sponsor’s investment menu
design, versus participant portfolio choices. Our study builds on a dataset encompassing over one
thousand firms and nearly one million participants, a substantially larger sample than previous
available to other studies. With both plan-level data and as well individual participant holdings,
we are uniquely able to separately identify and measure the size of diversification losses results
from these two distinct portfolio decisions.
To preview our findings, we show that, contrary to previous studies, the overwhelming
majority of 401(k) plan menus in our sample are efficiency when compared to a global market
portfolio. Thus, participants could construct a mean-variance efficient portfolio in virtually all of
the plans we analyzed. Nevertheless, the real-world participants in our dataset fall short of
exploiting the efficient menus provided to them, failing to diversify adequately as measured by
return losses and portfolio shares of idiosyncratic risk. We estimate that retirement wealth over a
35-year worklife might be reduced by as much as one-fifth due to participant diversification

errors. Indeed, employees’ actual portfolios yield worse results than what could be obtained
from a simple naïve allocation, where account balances would be divided evenly across the
offered menu. For this reason, we conclude that efforts to improve 401(k) portfolio efficiency
would best focus on improving participant portfolio choices through such strategies as greater
use of default investing or portfolio advice services. Also, while sponsors generally construct
efficient menus, we note that efficiency of an investment menu is less about offering large
numbers of funds and more about choosing a limited number of options diversified across the
capital markets.
In the remainder of the paper, we first describe the data and then assess the degree of both
plan and individual portfolio efficiency. Next, we investigate the factors which influence
portfolio performance/efficiency. A final section concludes.

Empirical Overview
Our dataset consists of 401(k) plans managed by Vanguard, a leading 401(k)
administrator and mutual fund investment manager. Plan-level data include both the number and
type of investment choices offered, total assets under management, numbers of participants
accounts, plan type, 3 and the monthly total return for each fund for the seven years prior. 4
Participant data include information on active accounts including account balances and amounts
held by the fund, contribution sources (employer or employee), and participant
sociodemographics (age, sex, plan tenure, non-retirement financial wealth, household income,

Most of the plans are 401(k) plans in for-profit firms; there are also a few 403(b) plans for the non-profit sector.
Monthly returns cover the period December 1997 through December 2004. In a handful of cases, some funds have

homeownership status, and whether the participant had web access). 5 Our sample includes
986,949 participants in 1,003 plans observed in December 2004.
Table 1 summarizes characteristics of the plans and investment menu offerings in our
sample. The average 401(k) plan had 1,222 participants holding $73 million in assets (Panel A).
Virtually all sponsors provided access to the range of broad asset classes, including short- and
longer-duration fixed income options, balanced, lifecycle or similar options, and equity options
(Panel B). Domestic active and index equity options were the most prevalent option (Panel C),
followed by money market and stable value options. Company stock was offered in 11 percent
of plans, and a brokerage window in only two percent of the plans.
Table 1 here
As shown in Table 2, the mean and median plan in our sample offered participants about
14 different investment choices in their 401(k) plans, consistent with other studies examining
investment menus.6 Figure 1 reveals the dispersion, from a low of 3 to a high of 59. A typical
plan offered about four actively-managed domestic equity funds, three actively-managed
balanced funds, and just over two indexed domestic equity choices as the most common options.
Figure 1 and Table 2 here
Using a much smaller longitudinal data set Brown, Liang, and Weisbenner (2007)
suggest that over time, the fraction of equity options in 401(k) plans has grown and most of the
newly-added funds were of the actively-managed variety.

They also indicate that this

wealth and household income is imputed by Axiom for 2003 using participant ZIP codes. Those who have elected to

All data are as of as of December 2004. Using 2002 data, Brown, Liang and Weisbenner report a mean of 14 plan
options based on a sample of firms filing 11-Ks; in 2004, the Profit-sharing/401(k) Council of America reported an
average number of options of 17-18. Our figure is larger than the eight in EGB’s (2006) older data on 401(k) plans
surveyed in 2001 by Moody’s Investor Service.

development might be costly to participants, if the index funds are less expensive and outperform
higher-cost actively managed funds. In Figure 2, we array a cross-section of the funds in our
sample according to the number of menu options and their investment management style (active
versus passive). Here we see that as the total number of funds increases in the cross-section,
domestic equity funds do indeed become more common, whether of the index or active variety.
Also active strategies are more prevalent than index strategies, and larger plans offer more active
equity choices than smaller plans, though they also provide more index funds. For example, a
plan with a small menu might offer a broad-based domestic index fund and access to a handful of
actively equity funds; meanwhile, a plan with a more complex menu might also offer large-,
mid- and/or small-capitalization components of the index, along with even greater choice of
active portfolios.
Figure 2 here
Turning to participants and their portfolio allocations, Panel A of Table 3 summarizes
demographic characteristics.7 The mean participant is 45 years old, male, with annual household
income of about $86,000. Non-retirement wealth amounts to about $42,000; most participants
(96 percent) own a home; and almost half (45 percent) of them have web access. Panel B
describes participant portfolios, where the mean 401(k) plan balance is $63,000.8 On average,
participants select 3.7 funds for their portfolio and hold the majority (88) percent of their
balances in risky assets (defined here as any equity or bond market asset with a fluctuating

market value). The average participant held 28 percent of assets in index funds (either indexed
bonds, equities or balanced options).9
Table 3 here
Plan and participant fund choices are reviewed in Figure 3, where we note a considerable
association between fund types offered and selected.10 It may be that plan sponsors offer the
options that participants demand, or conversely, that participants naively allocate their assets
across the funds on the menu. There is evidence of overinvestment in company stock: that is,
people hold a much higher share of company stock than is offered (perhaps influenced by
sponsors who direct a portion of employer contributions to employer stock). Participant
portfolios here tend to be dominated by domestic equity funds, either actively- or passivelymanaged, as well as actively-managed balanced funds. Lastly, participants tend to select
actively-managed instead of index funds, except in the case of bonds. This may be partly due to
the recent growth of actively-managed balanced funds.

Tests for Plan Menu Efficiency
To assess the efficiency of plan sponsor menu choices, we first compare existing plan
menus with market benchmarks. Because we evaluate the efficiency of risky portfolios, our

Thus, the average participant held 12 percent in money market or stable value assets, 28 percent in indexed assets
(stocks, bonds or balanced strategies), and the remaining 60 percent in active strategies (stocks, bonds or balanced
strategies).
10
These participant allocations are comparable to those reported by the EBRI/ICI Participant Data Collection
Project (ICI, 2008). In our sample, equity funds account for 52 percent of the assets; balanced funds 19 percent;
bond funds 8 percent; company stock 9 percent; and money market and stable value funds 12 percent. By
comparison in the EBRI/ICI sample, equity fund and balanced fund allocations for the same year at 46 percent and 8
percent; bonds 10 percent; company stock 15 percent; and money market and stable value funds 16 percent.

analysis is centered on the bond, equity, and balanced fund options held by each plan.11 We
measure plan-level efficiency in three ways. The first efficiency test applies the intersection or
“spanning” test developed by DeRoon, Nijman and Werker (2001). This test classifies plans as
either efficient or not based on how well they cover or span the global (liquid) capital markets.
However, this test does not provide a measure of how far a plan might fall from being efficient.
Accordingly, we provide two additional efficiency measures used in Calvet, Campbell and
Sodini (hereafter CCS, 2007): a plan-specific relative Sharpe ratio loss (RSRL) and a plan’s
idiosyncratic risk share.
The analysis of both plan sponsor and participant decisions draws on a seven-year (84month) reference period from 12/97-12/04 to develop the optimal or tangency portfolio offered
by the global capital markets during this period; plan sponsor fund selections and participant
fund choices are then compared with this global benchmark. For this period, as a longer historic
period from ‘79-04, Table 4 reports historic excess returns (versus Treasury bills) and standard
deviation for various asset classes. One characteristic of our reference period is that investors
experienced a lower equity risk premium for U.S. stocks, of one percent for large-capitalization
growth stocks and five percent for large-capitalization value stocks, versus 7.5 percent and 9
percent, respectively over the longer period. A second aspect is a distinctive bias toward value
stocks, while a third is higher stock market volatility and lower bond market volatility. While our
overall results should be interpreted in light of these characteristics, our reference period remains
a useful benchmark for analyzing the relative returns of plan sponsor menus and participant
portfolios versus a global market benchmark, because all are being evaluated by the same

Hence assets with a stable value (money funds and stable value funds) are excluded. Money market and
investment contract funds are excluded as non-risky assets. Brokerage option investments are also excluded as we
cannot observe their returns (only 2 percent of plans offer these). Returns on mutual funds are computed after
expenses, while all other index returns are before expenses.

yardstick. In the worst case, the efficiency losses we report below are likely to be lower-bound
estimates.
Table 4 here
The “spanning” test of efficiency. The first test of plan sponsor menu efficiency considers
whether a given plan’s menu could be made more efficient by introducing investment classes
currently excluded from the plan menu. As in EGB (2006), we construct a global market
benchmark composed of eight commonly-accepted market indexes which “span” the world’s
liquid stock and bond markets. The eight indexes include four domestic equity indexes following
the Fama-French equity style classification (Russell 1000 Growth, Russell 1000 Value, Russell
2000 Growth, and Russell 2000 Value Indexes); two domestic bond indexes based on credit
quality (Lehman Aggregate Index for the investment-grade bond market and Credit Suisse First
Boston High Yield for the non-investment-grade market); 12 one international equity index
(MSCI EAFE Index); and one international bond index (JP Morgan Global Government Bond
Non-US$ Index). Finally, the one-month Treasury-bill rate is taken as risk-free interest rate.
For each plan examined over our 84-month reference period, we regress ri,t, the excess
returns of the ith benchmark index (i=1,2…8) over Treasury bills in a given month, on the
monthly returns on the subset of funds held by the plan, Rt :
ri ,t   i   i Rt   i ,t

(1)

In this formulation,  i is the Jensen’s alpha from regression on ith benchmark index. Under this
test of efficiency, there are short sale constraints for both funds in a plan and market benchmark
index. As short-sales are not allowed for market benchmark index, if none of the  i are

bond funds.

9

statistically significantly positive, we could conclude that performance of funds under the plan
Rt cannot be improved by holding a long position in any of the eight market benchmark

indexes.13
Our results are reported in Table 5, where Panel A indicates that 94 percent of the 1,003
plans studied are efficient compared to market benchmarks, by this test. This implies that most
401(k) plan participants, in the majority of plans, could invest efficiently if they wisely exploited
the choices made available to them by their employer. Even plans with relatively few investment
choices can still be as efficient as our global benchmark portfolio, as long as they are carefully
chosen—a point we return to in the next section.
Table 5 here
Our finding of exceptionally high levels of 401(k) menu efficiency differs from EGB’s
earlier (2006) result, where efficiency ratings were worse. Two factors may account for this
difference. First, the EGB sample was a few years older, from 2001, and sponsors are likely to
have boosted the range of options provided by 2004. Second, their plans were smaller and far
less diversified than ours: for instance, only 71 percent plans in the EGB sample offered
domestic bond funds whereas 97 percent of our sample did so.
Relative Sharpe ratio loss. Our second measure of plan sponsor menu efficiency is the relative
Sharpe ratio loss, which measures the extent of economic loss from holding an inefficient
portfolio in the mean-variance framework (CCS, 2007). In our case, the portfolio to be measured
is the tangency portfolio of a plan based on the fund options it offers. The benchmark portfolio

is defined as the tangency portfolio formed by the eight market benchmark indexes introduced
earlier. For portfolio p, the relative Sharpe ratio loss is defined as:

is the Sharpe ratio of tangency portfolio of funds held under the plan; the

moments of the plan are estimated by the capital asset pricing model (CAPM; see the Appendix
for details); and S B is the Sharpe ratio of tangency portfolio of eight benchmark indexes used in
the efficiency test. The moments of the eight indexes are also estimated using CAPM. From
equation (2), we can see that the lower the ratio, the closer are the portfolio and benchmark
Sharpe ratios. In other words, when the two Sharpe ratios are exactly equal, the right hand term
is zero and there is no relative efficiency loss.
The first row of Panel B in Table 5 provides the distribution of relative Sharpe ratio
losses of the tangency portfolio formed by the available funds in each plan. Overall, the 401(k)
plans in our analysis sample perform very well compared to the benchmark portfolio: the mean
relative Sharpe ratio loss of three percent is quite low. In other words, the Sharpe ratio of the
tangency portfolio of an average plan is 97 percent of that of the benchmark portfolio (1 - .97/1
= .03). Furthermore, the sample plans vary little in terms of their relative Sharpe ratio losses:
even at the 90th percentile, the loss measure is only five percent. A small group of plans is less
well-structured; thus at the 99th percentile, the efficiency loss is 66 percent.14
Idiosyncratic risk share. Our third measure of plan menu efficiency is idiosyncratic risk share
measures—namely the percentage of portfolio total variance attributable to idiosyncratic risk.
______________________________
14

There appear to be two main sources of inefficiency. One is that these plans lack fixed income funds, which we
note again below. A second is that many of the most inefficient plans have small menus (the mean number of
options is 8) with an overallocation to active equity or balanced funds.

11

Idiosyncratic risk is defined as the risk that can be diversified away; it is non-market risk (CCS
2007), or specifically:
IRS p 

ˆ idio , p
ˆ p

(3)

^

where ̂ idio, p is the idiosyncratic risk of the tangency portfolio of funds held by the plan, and  p
is the total risk of the tangency portfolio. The lower the ratio, the more diversified a plan is
against specific or non-market risk.
The distribution of idiosyncratic risk shares across our sample of plans is displayed in the
second row in Panel B, of Table 5. On average, the idiosyncratic risk is three percent; in other
words, only three percent of the total variance of a plan’s tangency portfolio is diversifiable risk.
Even at the 90th percentile, the ratio is still below eight percent, which indicates a very high
diversification level. It is interesting that a handful, only one percent of the plans, do not perform
well according to this measure, having an idiosyncratic risk share of over 21 percent.15
Separately, we calculate relative Sharpe ratio losses and idiosyncratic risk shares for the
two groups of plans, efficient and inefficient, that emerge from the first “spanning” test.
Inefficient plans are not very different from efficient plans in the aggregate, suggesting that small
changes to many of the inefficient plans could improve their characteristics. Specifically, the
inefficient six percent of plans had a relative Sharpe ratio loss of four percent and idiosyncratic
risk shares of five percent, versus three and three percent for efficient plans. However, as noted
above, a small percentage of plans has very large Sharpe ratio losses or shares of idiosyncratic

As in the analysis of Sharpe ratio losses, these plans’ inefficiency appears due to the absence of bond funds, along
with to a limited extent active equity and balanced fund choices in small menus.

12

risk and modest changes in these plans are unlikely to result in a shift from an inefficient to an
efficient plan.
In sum, we conclude that virtually all of the plan menus offered in this sample are quite
efficient in terms of mean-variance efficiency measures, as they are well diversified. By and
large, plan sponsors appear to construct menus that afford participants the opportunity to build
well-diversified portfolios. Even among the few inefficient plans, many do not far terribly short
and these shortfalls can be remedied by modest menu changes.

Tests for Participant Portfolio Efficiency
Next we turn to the efficient of the individual portfolios constructed by participants. In
contrast to the prior section where our analysis is conducted at the plan level, the focus here
shifts to the individual portfolios constructed by each participant. We use three measures to
evaluate the efficiency of participant portfolio choices:
(1) Participant total return loss, or the return loss in the participant’s portfolio compared
to what he could have optimally obtained in a global capital markets benchmark, independent of
the menu choices offered to him or her; this measure summarizes losses due to inefficient
portfolio choices by both the sponsor and the participant;
(2) Participant relative return loss, or the return loss in the participant’s portfolio
compared to the set of investment choices offered to him or her; these are losses due purely to
participant (and not plan sponsor) investment errors; and,
(3) Participant idiosyncratic risk share, or the extent to which participant portfolio
returns arise from market (nondiversifiable) versus specific (diversifiable) risk.

13

Participant total return loss. A participant’s “total return loss” is the shortfall in portfolio return
experienced by a participant’s actual portfolio, given his choice of risk, compared to the return
he could have realized in the broader global capital markets for the same level of risk. Assume
that a participant in plan j chooses a portfolio p with risk level  p . The monthly total return
loss for his portfolio is:
RL p  w p (  B   p )

(4)

where  B is the best return that could be optimally attained at risk level  p using the eight
market benchmark indexes representing the liquid global capital markets ; and  p is the actual
return of the participant’s portfolio for the same risk level  p . The term w p refers to the risky
asset share, which is calculated using the balances in each individual participant’s portfolio. This
weight permits the measure to reflect the fact that participants holding poorly performing risky
assets might still be close to the efficient frontier if they their risky exposure is small. The unscaled total return loss before weight adjustment is demonstrated by the line segment A in Figure
4, where (  p ,  p ) is the actual portfolio chosen by the participant, and the outer curve is the
efficient frontier formed by the eight market benchmark indexes.
Figure 4 here
To measure this in practice, we use the distribution of the monthly participant total return
losses for the 986,949 individual portfolios in 1,003 plans, depicted in Figure 5. The mean
monthly total return loss is 0.1093 percent or approximately 11 basis points; about three percent
of the participants have a return loss of zero, while one percent of participants have a total return
loss of over 0.4 percent or 40 basis points per month. To put these results in context, if one
expected a diversified 401(k) portfolio to generate an annual real return of five percent after

14

expenses, the typical participant would be predicted to forfeit 23 percent of his expected
retirement wealth over a 35-year worklife by having a less-than-adequate plan investment menu
and by failing to diversify adequately.16 Wealth losses would be even greater for those in the
fifth or first percentile cases.
Figure 5 here
Participant relative return loss. Next we compute the participant total return loss, which
measures the total shortfall due to both plan sponsor menu and participant investment choices.
The participant relative return loss reflects only the inefficiency resulting from poor participant
investment choices within a given plan. We evaluate this by computing the best return obtainable
in plan j for risk level  p or is  B in equation (4), keeping all other factors constant. That is, we
calculate the return shortfall of each actual individual portfolio compared to the best return that
could be obtained in the same plan for the same risk level. Thus, line segment B in Figure 4
reflects the un-scaled relative return loss before weight adjustment wp in equation (6), where the
interior curve is the efficient frontier formed by funds available in a plan. (The difference
between segments A and B measures the inefficiency caused by menu restrictions.)
Panel B in Figure 5 sketches the distribution of monthly relative return losses for the
same participants, where we see that these losses are concentrated around a monthly mean loss of
0.079 percent or 8 basis points per month. At the extremes, some six percent of the participants
have a return loss of zero, while one percent of participants experience a return loss of over 0.29
percent or 29 basis points per month. The mean monthly relative return loss of eight basis points
would imply 18 percent less in retirement wealth over a 35-year saving period.
______________________________
16

We assume a participant saves for 35 years, has an initial salary of $30,000 a year, experiences real wage growth
of 1 percent per year and real after-fee returns of 5 percent per year (a monthly return of 41 basis points), and
contributions 9 percent of pay to his 401(k) account (6 percent employee and 3 percent employer contribution).
Terminal wealth is $276,700 with a 5 percent real return; $212,100 with the reduced return.

15

From this measure, we conclude that most participants fail to construct an optimal
portfolio from the menu offered to them by their plan sponsor, and an important subset of
participants suffers a substantial return loss, undermining long term wealth accumulation. On
average, the relative return loss from participant investment mistakes accounts for three-quarters
(76 percent) of the total return loss, indicating that participant portfolio choice inefficiency is the
main source of underperformance. About one-quarter of the efficiency loss could be addressed
by better plan menus.
Participant idiosyncratic risk share. Our third participant measure is the idiosyncratic risk share
of an individual participant’s portfolio, defined as the ratio of idiosyncratic risk to the portfolio’s
total variance. Figure 6 on the distribution of this measure shows that the mean value of the
idiosyncratic risk share is 0.187, much higher than the 0.03 share in the average plan. There is a
wide range in idiosyncratic risk shares from 0.001 to 0.997; also the top five percent of
participants has an idiosyncratic risk share of more than 0.77, meaning that 77 percent of the
portfolio variance is not rewarded by higher expected return. By this measure, many participants
also take a substantial amount of specific or idiosyncratic risk, either because they hold activelymanaged funds or company stock in their portfolios.

Actual portfolios versus naïve allocation strategies. As a measure of the costs of poor portfolio
choices, we compare participants’ actual portfolio choices with what would happen if they used
a naïve diversification strategy, such as simply dividing their portfolio among all available funds
using a 1/N strategy. To do so, we evaluate the relative return loss and idiosyncratic risk share of
a hypothetical participant in each plan who follows a naive allocation strategy, and compare the
results to workers’ actual portfolio characteristics. Results appear in Figure 7, which confirm that

16

actual individual portfolios underperform even the naive allocation strategy. Individual
portfolios have a slightly higher relative return loss (0.079 vs.0.076 percent per month). But they
also have a much higher idiosyncratic risk share (0.187 vs. 0.04), suggesting that individual
portfolios are more highly exposed to non-market risk through active funds and company stock
than would hold with a simple naïve strategy.
Figure 7 here

Determinants of Portfolio Efficiency: Behavioral and Plan Menu Effects
Given the meaningful inefficiencies we have identified in portfolio choices in 401(k) and
other DC plans, what might be done to enhance investment patterns? Two approaches might be
taken to improve 401(k) investment performance: improving investment menu decisions by plan
sponsors, or altering individual participant investment choices. In this section, we examine
factors contributing to the variation in portfolio performance across plan investment menus and
participant portfolios, so as to explore what characteristics contribute to portfolio efficiency in
each setting. In particular, we seek to learn whether simply adding more funds, as many plan
sponsors are doing today, is likely to boost plan efficiency at the menu level, and, at the
participant level, what types of asset allocation changes are needed to improve diversification
levels.
Plan sponsor menu effects. To determine what plan sponsor menu decisions might influence
plan efficiency, we run multivariate regressions of the form:
Perform j    1 PLANCOMPj   2 PLANCHAR j   3 PRTCHARi , j   (5)

where the dependent variable Perform j is a vector of outcomes of the previous measures of
plan-level efficiency. Specifically, the vector includes: a (0,1) indicator with the value of 1 if the

17

plan is efficient (0 if not); the plan’s relative Sharpe ratio loss; and the plan’s idiosyncratic risk
share. The explanatory variable PLANCOMP represents a vector of plan characteristics including
the number of options offered and the availability of different types of risky funds. A second
vector of explanatory variables PLANCHAR is used to control for plan characteristics such as
plan size (measured by the natural logarithm of the number of accounts, the log of the plan’s
total assets, and contribution source). We also control on PRTCHAR, which captures participant
characteristics such as age, sex, plan tenure, and income as well as asset indicators – some of
which are likely correlated with financial sophistication (the natural logs of household income
and non-retirement financial wealth, as well as homeownership and web access).
Table 6 shows the results of these multivariate models, where the first is a Probit
regression on whether or not the plan is efficient, and the other two are OLS regressions on the
relative Sharpe ratio loss and idiosyncratic risk share. The first equation indicates that simply
having more funds listed on the menu does not improve plan efficiency. The second suggest that
adding funds does reduce the relative Sharpe ratio loss and idiosyncratic risk share. For example,
at the mean, adding one fund reduces these factors by -0.4 percent, or more than 10 percent of
the mean loss and mean risk share. The marginal benefit from adding more options is also
decreasing, as indicated by the concave relationship from the variable, the number of options
squared. This result suggests that adding more options may improve menu design but at a
declining rate.
Table 6 here
Figure 8 reinforces this conclusion. It shows the average relative Sharpe ratio loss and
idiosyncratic risk share calculated earlier, for plans arrayed by the number of funds offered. The
measures fall dramatically until about ten options and then declines at a much smaller rate for

18

larger menus. It would seem that a well-chosen menu of 10 options achieves much of the
efficiency gains to be realized.
Figure 8 here
In terms of investment options, the plan efficiency test (the first column in Table 6)
implies that indexed domestic equities and bonds would the main asset classes that inefficient
plans would have to add. Since most of the inefficient plans are small in size, it would appear
that the limited number of index and active equity and balanced choices in their line-up are
insufficient for adequate diversification.
Participant portfolio decisions. We examine the determinants of participant portfolio choices
using the following multivariate regression:
PERFORM i , j    1 INVESTi , j   2 DEMOi , j   3 PLAN j   i , j

(6)

For the ith participant in the jth plan, dependent variables Performi , j refer to the portfolio
relative return losses as well as idiosyncratic risk share calculated previously at the participant
account level. INVESTi , j refers to a vector of individual investment characteristics including the
number of funds chosen, company stock share and shares of eight types of funds: index and
active versions of domestic equity, international equity, balanced funds and bond funds.
DEMOi , j refers to individual demographic characteristics such as the participant’s age, income,

non-retirement wealth, and web access. PLAN j refers to a vector of plan-specific characteristics
which affect participant performance and are common among all participants in the same plan.17

Table 7 reports results for our two dependent variables, the participant’s relative return
loss and the participant’s idiosyncratic risk share. Holding more funds in a portfolio does reduce
return losses, but only by an economically tiny effect (by two-hundreds of a basis point versus a
mean loss of eight basis points). However, owning more funds does reduce idiosyncratic risk
meaningfully—adding an additional fund reduces such risk by six percent. Second, participant
portfolios can best be improved from a return loss perspective by diversifying into all asset
classes other than the reference category, domestic indexed equities. In terms of the most
important asset class to consider, it would be bond funds, active or passive. Yet at the same time,
as measured in the second regression, such portfolios do (at the margin) increase idiosyncratic
risk relative to domestic index holdings.
Table 7 here
Finally, we find that in terms of participant characteristics, those who access their
accounts through the internet have lower return losses, but also higher exposure to non-market
risk. At the margin, young and higher-income participants have smaller return losses, as do
those with more wealth outside their retirement plan. In any event the measured economic
effects are quite small.

Conclusions and Discussion
We consider the quality of portfolio investment choices made in 401(k) and other U.S.
defined contribution plans using a rich new dataset of more than 1,000 plans and nearly one
million participants. Our assessment distinguishes between the effects arising from the plan
sponsor’s menu design decisions, versus those arising from the portfolio decisions of plan
participants. Overwhelmingly, we find that the plans in our sample are efficient compared to a

20

global capital markets benchmark; we classified 94 percent of plans as efficient, and only six
percent as inefficient. Many of the inefficient plans could make small changes to improve
diversification levels by adding domestic equity and bond portfolios to their existing line-ups.
Moreover, simply adding more investment options does not necessarily lead to large gains in
efficiency. Once a minimum number of well-chosen funds is included in a pension plan menu
(roughly 10 or so), most of the diversification gains are likely to have been realized.
At the same time, while sponsors are able to construct highly-efficient plan menus, many
participants err by investing ineffectively and by failing to exploit the diversification
opportunities offered within their plans. On average, they forfeit eight basis points of potential
return per month based on our analysis period. Because of the long-term effects from
compounding such errors, small mistakes over time can be important, reducing retirement wealth
by as much as one-fifth over a 35-year worklife. These findings complement the growing
literature on investor behavioral biases, investment errors, and financial illiteracy.
One avenue for improving participant portfolios is to improve financial education and
investment literacy levels. But education programs require pro-active decision-making by
participants, and it is by now well established that inertia is a dominant decision heuristic for
many participants. Accordingly, sponsors and policymakers will want to consider efforts to
improve participant portfolios through other means.

These might include better default

investment strategies as well as investment advice programs. The U.S. Department of Labor,
acting under the 2006 Pension Protection Act, has authorized a series of “qualified default
investment alternatives” (QDIAs) including balanced funds, target-date strategies, and managed
account advisory services. 18 Greater adoption of such strategies by plans and by participants

(whether by active choice or by default) is likely to improve portfolio efficiency metrics within
401(k) plans.
Although we focus here mainly on behavior in individual retirement accounts, our
research has implications for portfolio choice and wealth outcomes more generally. Today
almost half of all Americans have at least some assets in tax-deferred accounts, and furthermore,
asset allocations prove to be quite similar inside and outside tax-deferred accounts (Bergstresser
and Poterba 2004). Consequently, it is likely that the inefficiencies observed in the retirement
context are replicated outside the 401(k) setting.

Appendix: Estimating Return Moments
To compute each plan’s performance measures, we must estimate each plan-specific
mean and variance of returns. We adopt the CAPM asset pricing model and following Calvet,
Campbell, and Sodini (2007), regress fund returns on three market indexes:

Rit   i1 MKTt   i2 BONDt   i3 EAFEt   i ,t ,
where Ri ,t is the excess return for fund i; MKT is the excess return for Russell 3000 (broad
domestic equity market); BOND is the excess return for Lehman US aggregate (broad domestic
bond market); EAFE is the excess return for MSCI EAFE (international equity market); and the
time period is 12/97~12/04 (or less if not available for some funds). Using the estimated risk
loading ˆi1 , ˆi2 , ˆi3 from the regression above, we can estimate moments for each fund:

ˆ f  ˆˆ , ˆ f  ˆˆ ˆ 'ˆ idio , where ̂ f is the vector of estimated mean excess return over all
funds; ̂ f is the estimated variance-covariance matrix of excess returns over all funds;

̂

is the

vector of three betas over all funds ˆ  (bˆ1 ,..., bˆi )' , bˆi  ( ˆi1 , ˆi2 , ˆi3 ) ; ̂ is the mean excess return
over three benchmark funds, ˆ  (ˆ MKT, ˆ BOND , ˆ EAFE )' ; ̂ is the variance-covariance matrix of
three benchmark funds; and ̂ idio is the estimated idiosyncratic risk of funds estimated from the
variance-covariance matrix of regression residuals  i,t .
Based on the estimated mean and variance of returns over all funds, we estimate
moments of plans: ˆ p   ' ˆ f , ˆ p   ' ˆ f  , ˆ idio, p   ' ˆ idio , where  is the weight vector over
all funds in each plan.
