Investment and Sales: Some Empirical Evidence

ABSTRACT

This paper attempts to give a structural interpretation to the distributed lag
of sales on investment at the two-digit level in US manufacturing. It first presents
a simple model which captures the various sources of lags and their respective
implications. It then estimates the model, using both data on investment and sales as
well as direct evidence on the sources of lags. The spirit of the paper is

exploratory

the model is used mainly as a vehicle to construct, present and

interpret the data.

We find that the following model can roughly generate the distributed lag
structure found in the data. Firms face delivery lags of 3 quarters. They also face
adjustment costs, which lead them to take into account expected future sales, with
discount factor .9 when constructing the desired capital stock, and to close about 5%
of the gap betwen actual and desired capital per quarter. They pay for orders at a
constant rate between the time of order and that of delivery. The model is however
not very successful in explaining differences in dynamics across sectors.

This paper attempts to give a structural interpretation to the distributed lag
of sales on investment at the two digit level in US manufacturing. It first presents
a simple model which captures the various sources of lags and their respective
implications. It then estimates the model, using both data on investment and sales as
well as direct information on the sources of lags. The spirit of the paper is
exploratory ; the model is used mainly as a vehicle to construct, present and
interpret the data.

Lags in the response of investment expenditures to sales can be attributed to
four main sources. The first is expectations. Investment depends on future sales,
which themselves depend on current and past sales. The next two come from technology.
One, costs of adjustment, is internal to the firm. The other, delivery lags, is
external to the firm. Together, they imply that the firm is neither willing nor able
to adjust its capital stock completely and instantaneously to movements in sales. The
last source is financial. While the theory describes investment orders, data are
about investment expenditures, which are related to orders by a distributed lag.
Section 1 of the paper presents a model which incorporates these four sources
explicitly and shows their respective implications.

Section 2 presents the basic investment and sales characteristics of each cf the
industries studied in the paper. It estimates a reduced form relation of investment
on sales and the capital stock, showing common patterns and differences across
industries.

Given the existence of data on orders and deliveries by sector of origin one
can construct direct estimates of delivery lags by type of good. Given information on
the composition of capital by industry, one can construct estimates of delivery lags
by sector of destination, These estimates are presented in Section 3.

Section 4 examines the stochastic behavior of sales in each industry.

It

shows

substantial differences in univariate representations of sales across industries.
There appears to be a relation between the degree of persistence of sales and the
size of the effect of sales on investment, which supports the hypothesis that the
stochastic behavior of sales is an important determinant of the distributed lag
effect of sales on investment.

through estimation

A more formal test of the theory is carried out in Section 5,

of the structural model developed in section 1. The model is somewhat successful in

explaining the distributed lag structures and the differences across industries
through plausible structural parameters.

Section 6 reviews and assesses the main results of the paper.

Section I

.

A

flexible accelerator model

We specify a flexible accelerator model. That is, we work under the maintained
hypotheses that there is a causal relation from sales to investment, and that no
factors other than sales affect investment1. While we do not believe that either of
these two assumptions is correct, we see this shorcut as appropriate For a first look
at the data2. We assume that investment behavior is characterized by

St

is the information set at time t, which includes at least
current and lagged sales.

Consider first the case where firms face costs of adjustment of capital but no
delivery lags, so that n = 0. In this case, investment orders, expenditures and
deliveries are identical. From equation (1), net investment is equal to a fraction X
of the gap between desired and actual capital, plus a disturbance term ; gross

investment is equal to net investment plus replacement investment eK_1. Desired
capital in turn depends on the sequence of expected future sales, with discount
factor o

a

is

the steady state ratio of capital to sales.

Costs o-f adjustement give us two important parameters, a gap parameter X and a
discount parameter a-. These are not strictly speaking technological parameters, but

rather functions of underlying technological parameters3. For example, an increase in
the convexity of costs of adjustment reduces X and increases c

firms adjust more

slowly and look at expected sales further in the -future. We shall however treat them
directly as structural parameters.

4

Consider now the case where firms also -face delivery lags. Delivery lags are

formalized in the simplest possible way, by assuming that capital is delivered arid
ready to use n periods after it is ordered4. This modifies all four equations. At
time t, there is nothing the firm can do about its capital stock until time t+n
(orders cannot be cancelled). Thus, in equation (1), orders close a fraction of the
gap between the expected desired capital stock at time t+n and the actual capital
stock at time t+n—1, which is known as of time t. Similarly replacement investment

orders at time t are equal to $K+_. The expected desired capital stock at time t+n
in equation (2) depends in turn on the sequence of sales From time t+n on, expected
as of time t ;

given the delivery lags, sales expected between t and t+n—1 have no

effect on current investment decisions. Equation (3)

is

the modified accumulation

equation. Equation (4) gives expenditures as a distributed lag on orders. The
implicit assumption is that payment for capital goods is made partly on order, partly

before delivery, with the remainder paid at delivery. Delivery lags introduce
therefore a more complex dynamic relation both between orders and sales and between
expenditures and orders.

To summarize, the dynamic relation between investment and sales depends on the
characteristics of the sales process through expectations, on costs of adjustment
through X and a, on delivery lags through n and on order—expenditure lags through

Cw) i=O,...,n. To see how they interact, we now consider a simple example.

Peristence of sales, costs of adjustment and delivery

Consider the case in which sales follow a stationary first order process.
Ignoring constant terms for notational simplicity, let S

follow

C

Solving

for expectations in (2) and replacing in (1 gives

Thus, five coefficients affect the size of the effect of S on I, , QB, X,

and

n. The first is the capital sales ratio and is non—dynamic. The next two, X and c,
are functions of costs of adjustment. More conve< costs of adjustment decrease X,
reducing the effect of any change in S. They also increase a, leading firms to look

over

a longer horizon ; if

is less than one, this will also decrease the effect o-f

S. Delivery lags are responsible for the term

When

is less than one, this

also decreases the effect of S on I.

If the effect of adjustment costs, delivery lags and persistence on the size of
the effect of sales on investment is relatively straightforward, their effect on the
dynamic, distributed lag relation is much less obvious. Indeed, in the above example,
only current sales affect current orders. Only i-F sales follow a higher order process

will investment orders depend on a distributed lag of sales. In that case, the lag of
investment expenditures on sales will be a convolution of this lag and the order
expenditure lag. Little can be said in general about this convolution ; i-f forecasts
of future sales depend or a distributed lag of past sales with both positive and
negative coefficients, some coefficients on lagged sales nay well be negative.

Section 2. Basic characteristics of the data

We have selected all the 2 ar 2 digit manufacturing se:toE for which we had
quarterly data on orders, shipments and investment expenditures, ai well as
associated price deflators. The result was the choice of thrteeri se:tors, eleven 2—
digit sectors and two 3—digit sectors (motor vehicles and aircraft). Their names and
mnemonics are given in the first two columns of Table 1. Orders, shipments and
expenditures are directly available. Capital stock series, which are needed for

estimation are constructed by accumulation of investment expenditures. Appendix A
gives sources, methods of construction and other information on the data. One data
problem must be mentioned in the text

shipments are collected or an establishment

basis, while investment expenditures are collected an a company basis. This is not a
major problem for most sectors except for Petroleum, in which a large proportion of
investment expenditures by companies classified in petroleum takes place in
activities largely unrelated to petroleum (see appendix A for details). The sample
period is 1958—1 to 1979—3.

In examining the data, both informally here, or using econometric techniques
later, we assume that investment and shipments have both a detersinistic and a
stochastic component. We assume the deterministic component tc be the sum of an
exponential time trend and seasonal dummies. Examining the data using the alternative
assumption that there is no deterministic time trend would be useful but we have not
done it in this paper.

The first six columns of numbers in table 1 give the estimated growth rates, the
means and the standard deviations of the deviations from trend and seasonal, for
investment and shipments for each sector. While we shall not focus on these
deterministic components in what follows, it must be noted that there is both wide
variation of growth rates among sectors, and between investment and shipments in a
given sector ;

One of

the reasons why investment may

move more or less compared to shipments

across sectors is simply the difference jr their capital/shipments ratios, . The
next column gives mean capital/shipments ratios. For reasons explained above, the
main outlier, petroleum, overestimates the true capital to shipments ratio, probably
by a factor of 2. Otherwise, the capital/shipments ratio varies between .24 and .63.
Two sectors which are similar in all respects except in their mean capital
shipments ratio, will have the same ratio of

coefficient

of variation of investment

to the coefficient of variation of shipments. This ratio, denoted R, is given in the
last column. Except for food where it is equal to 5, this ratio varies across sectors
from 1.5 to 3.0.

Table 2 gives further evidence on the relation between investment and shipments,
by giving, for each sector, estimates of the relation

We shall see in Section 5 that this equation is, under specific assumptions
about the information set, the approximate reduced form of the structural model

described in equations (1) to (4). The equation gives investment expenditures as
depending on capital at the end of the previous quarter, on current and lagged values
of shipments, up to 6 lags, and o-f a first order disturbance term. In addition to

these variables, regressions include a constant, a deterministic exponential time
trend and seasonal dummies
The coefficients on K(—1) and S to S(—6) are reported in the first seven

columns. The next two columns give the sum of coefficients on shipments, E, and the

sum divided by the mean capital shipment ratio, (/). If all sectors were the same,

except for their acer capital output ratio, (ia) would be the same across sectors.
The next column reports the value of the likelihood ratio test statistic, L,

associated with the hypothesis that shipments play no role in explainin investsent
expenditures. The last two columns give the coefficient of serial correlation cf the
disturbance and the P2 on the Q—transforflied variables, after taking out the

deterministic trend end the seasonal component.
For four of the sectors (FO, CH, PET, PM) shipments have no significant effect

on investment, and the cumulative effect (measured by /) is quantitatively small.
For eight of the sectors, and for most of durable manufacturing (PA, RU and BCG in
non durable manufacturIng, and FM, NEM, EM, MV and AC in durable manufacturing),
shipments have a very significant effect, with an average cumulative effect of .31.

To get a feel for the sice of this coefficient, suppose that shipments followed a
random walk

the cumulative effect of shipments as measured by Ei, would then be

equal to X. A coefficient of 4

would then mean full adjustment of investment to the

anticipated gap between desired capital and actual capital.
As we do not impose constraints on the distributed lag structure,

multicollinearity implies that the shape of the leg structure is not estimated very
tightly. The lag structure shows no definite pattern, and in particular no sign of
smooth decay as the lag length increases ;

in

many sectors, coefficients on S(—1) to

S(—3) are larger and more significant than the others.
In the rest of the paper, we try to explain the characteristics o-f these

distributed lag structures and why they differ across sectors. But before we turn to
this task, we must mention another characteristic of these reduced forms. For all
sectors, even those where shipments are quantitatively and statistically significant,
the disturbance term, which measures the effects of variables other than sales, is
highly serially correlated and explains a good part of the movement in investment.

9

ThE adjusted R2 is in most cases not very high

its average value for the sectors jr

which shipments are significant is of .29. A large part of movements in investment
is thus not due to shipments (This is true also when shipments are replaced by orders
in (5)).

Even

if we

were successful in explaining the effects of

investment, there would be a lot

left

shipments

on

to be explained.

Section 3. Direct evidence on delivery lags

In this section, we construct direct estimates of delivery lags facing each of
the sectors. We proceed in four steps. We first derive the capital composition of

each sector, and then calculate the delivery lag associated with each type of
equipment and structure. Next, we combine the information on capital composition and
delivery lag by type of good to get average delivery lags by sector. Finally, we
study whether the delivery lag associated with each type of good is approximately
constant or, instead, varies cyclically with the output of the sector producing the
type of capital goods.

Sectoral composition of capital
We construct a capital stock decomposition for each sector. We start from the
capital flow tables, which give the amount of investment of each type for each
sector, for both 1967 and 1972. We then go from these flows to stocks by using
information about depreciation and growth rates for each type of good and each
sector. The details of the computation are given in appendix B. The results are given
in table 3.

1 0

capital equipment comes nearl entirely from four sectors mainly from non
electrical

machinery,

with smaller amounts coming from fabricated metals, electrical

sachinery and motor vehicles. The ratio of capital equipment to structures is similar
across sectors and close to unity, except for petroleum which has a much larger
proportion of structures in capital.

Delivery lags by type of capital qood

We use different approaches to the construction of delivery lags for structures
and equipment.

Data on time to completion for different types of structures are directly
available ; we therefore use them.

No such data exist on equipment and more work is needed. Of the four sectors
producing equipment, only three have delivery lags ; motor vehicles may be assumed to
be sold from stock. We have data on unfilled and new orders as well as on shipments
-for the remaining three sectors. If these sectors produced only capital goods, and if

all goods were produced to order, then the ratio of unfilled orders to shipments
would give a good estimate of the average delivery lag associated with these goods.

These two assumptions are however strongly violated : the proportion in total sales
of goods sold as capital goods is only of 4% for fabricated metals 207. for
electrical machinery and 43% for non electrical machinery. We use therefore the
following approach. We assume that all capital goods are produced to order and that
all sales by the producing sector to wholesalers and retailers, and only these sales,
are from stock. We then estimate the mean delivery lag by

where V, S and b are respectively mean unfilled orders, mean shipeents and
the proportion of shipments sold to wholesalers and retailers for sector i. (Details
of construction are given in appendix B b varies between 42 and 46). The results
are given in table 4. Delivery laqs appear similar across the different types of
equipment ;

this

uniformity no doubt hides differences at a more disaggregated level.

Not surprisingly, delivery lags are longer for structures than for equipment. It
takes on average a year to build an industrial structure while it takes appro<imately
six months to receive equipment.

Delivery lags by

sector

All that is left to do is to combine results about sectoral composition with
those about delivery lags by type of capital. Implied average delivery lags by sector

of destination are given in Table 5. The main result, for our purposes is that,
except for petroleum, all sectors face very similar delivery lag structures ; the
mean delivery lag varies between 3.2 and 3.5 quarters8. This is therefore not the
source of the difference of the response of investment to shipments across sectors.

Cyclical behavior of delivery lags
Before leaving delivery lags, we return to a maintained assumption of our model,
and indeed of all models which assumed a linear relation between demand and
investment, namely that of constancy of delivery lags. We can use the time series on
orders and shipments for the capital producing sectors to examine the validity of
this assumption. if we assume that the proportion of production to order in total
production is constant over the cycle, then if delivery lags are constant, the
relation

between orders and shipments should be constant through time. We therefore

run the following regression

duly registered this result, we nevertheless proceed to estimate our model which is
based ar constant lags ;

but these results make clear that the linear relation

between investment and shipments is at best a rough approximation and that further
research might uncover non—linearities.

Section 4. Dynamic behavior of sales

We have seen that whether or not an increase in current sales is expected to
persist is an important determinant of the relation between investment expenditures
and shipments, and that differences in processes for shipments across sectors have
the potential to explain differences in the dynamic response of investment to
shipments. In this section, we examine the characteristics of the univariate
representation of shipments across sectors.

Table 7 presents the results of estimation of AR(4) processes for shipments. As
discussed earlier, we maintain the assumption of a deterministic time trend and
deterministic seasonality. Thus, we also include an exponential time trend and
seasonal dummies

their coefficients are not reported. An AR(4) representation is

sufficient to capture the dynamics o-f the stochastic component of shipments C

statistics are given in the table). In addition to the coefficients and their sum,
table 6 presents the expected time between two successive downcrossings of the means
which provides a measure of the length of the cycle in shipments.
Table 7 shows large variations in persistence across sectors. Food exhibits low
persistence ;

at the other end, textiles, fabricated metals, electrical and non

electrical machinery, and aircraft exhibit high persistence. In two of these sectors
(TX,AC) ,

the hypothesis of non—stationarity cannot be rejected (using the

distribution appropriate under the assumption of a unit root and the presence of a
deterministic time trend in the regression). In many sectors, the degree of

with delivery lags of up to a year, we would expect

To see whether these differences in processes may help explain variations in the
investment—shipments relation, the last column reports the normalised sue of
coefficients on shipments in the investment equation, from table 2. One expects,
ceteris paribus, a positive relation between persistence and the normalised sum of

coefficients. There is indeed some relation between the two

the rank correlation

between cycle length and the normalised sum is equal to .42, which is significant at

the 1O level. The relation is however not tiht ; motor vehicles for example has lOW
persistence of shipments and a strong effect of shipments on investment. The next
section provides a more formal assessment by estimating the structural investment
equation implied by (1) to (4) given the sales process.

Section 5. Structural estimation

Derivation of the reduced form implied by (1) to (4)

The first step is to eliminate unobservable expectations. We assume that the'
information set includes only current and lagged investment expenditures and

shipments, and that shipments are uncorrelated at all leads and ias with the

disturbance . This implies that expectations of shipments conditional on the
information set are the same as forecasts of shipments using a univariate
representation. This joint assumption is stronger than is needed for estimation, but

allows a more intuitive nterpretatiori of the relation between the :hara:teristics of

the shipments process presented in sectior; 4 and the characteristics c the relation
between investment and shipmentst0. Let the R(4) process -for shipments be given by

Investment expenditures depend on three sets of terms. The first is a
distributed lag of sales : the second depends on capital -from K_1 to

determine past and current orders, and thus current expenditures

which

the third depends

on current and past disturbances.

Equation (7) is the equation to be estimated. Before we do so, we make two
approximations
The first follows from the fact that K is unobservable. We only observe

expenditures, not deliveries of

capital.

Thus, the K series constructed by

accumulation using expenditures includes capital paid for but not yet delivered. If
capital goods were paid fully on order, our constructed K: would measure the true

16

K+ and we could us our constructed

in equation (7); if capital

Qoods were instead paid fully on delivery, our constructed K would correctly measure

the true K and we should use our constructed

in equation (7). Rather

than to attempt to construct a two sided moving average of K to capture the second
term in (7), we simply proxy E Ut

K+__1

by our constructed

Given the slow

movement of K. compared to X, this is unlikely to be a source of major problems. It

may however bias the coeffcient on capital, an issue to which we shall return.
The second is in the specification of the process followed by the disturbance

term in (7). If t

followed

an AR(1), the disturbance term would follow an ARMA(l,n).

In general, the disturbance term in (7) is likely to have an MA component at least o
order n. For computational convenience, we ignore this MA component and assume that
the disturbance term follows an AR process. We have found that an AR(l) appears
sufficient to yield white noise residuals.

restrictions and identification

The structural parameters in equation (7) are X, , n,

$,

and the

non—trivial elements of A ( is a vector of 1 and 0's>. From the previous sections we
have information on some of these elements, which we now use.

From section 3, we know that n, the average delivery lag is for all sectors —

except petroleum— approximately equal to 3. Thus, we use n=3 in what follows''.

i-I

in section 4 we have estiaated the univariate representations of shipments. We
use these estimated coeffl:ients

to

combination of the assumption that

construct the matri<

n• arid

for each sector2. The

that S follows an

4 implies the

presence of S to S(—6) jr the investment equation.

This leaves the parameters \, u, ,

and {w)i=O. . . ,:3.

If the order—expenditure structure is left unconstrained, there are enough
structural parameters to fit the reduced form exactly. Even if we impose that the w,

be non negative, the model is in practice overparametrized and we are likely to end
up explaining the reduced form distributed lag by a pseudo structural order
expenditure lag structure. We therefore constrain the lag structure {Wt)

to

obey

w free
=

(1—) (l+w+,2)1wi,

for I =

12,3

Weights are exponentially declining if w is less than unity, exponentially
increasing if w is greater than unity.

Under the above assumptions, all remaining structural parameters are identified.

We have found however that our estimates of (X) and a-were highly correlated
asymptotically. Thus, it is impossible to estimate precisely the discount parameter

g3 and we are forced to assume rather than estimate the value of a. This is
unfortunate as a-, which measures the degree to whichfirms discount the future, is
one of the most interesting parameters of the model. We choose a value o-f a of .9
(values between .85 and .95 make little difference to the fit).

18

Finally, returnlng to equation (8), we see that we can estimate separately ()
and (X—8). Using the values of

and

derived in sections 2 and 3 imposes an

overiderti4ying restriction on X ; using either

or 6 just identifies X. We decide

to estimate (Xe) and (X—) unconstrained. Given these estimates, we can by usinq the
values of

and 6 from the previous sections construct two estimates of X, one from

the reaction of investment to sales, and one from the eect of the past capital
stock on investment.

Implied constrained reduced forms and estimated structural parameters.
Equation (8) is estimated by maximum likelihood14. The results of estimation of
equation (8) are reported in tables B and 9. Table 8 reports the coefficients of the
constrained reduced form and repeats for comparison the coefficients of the
unconstrained reduced form already reported in table 2. Table 9 gives the values of
the structural parameters.

We start with table 8. In addition to the coefficients, it gives the values ot
two test statistics. The first one, Li, tests the constrained model against a model
where all coefficients on shipments are equal to zero ;

it

shows therefore whether

shipments play an important role in explaining investment in the structural model.
The second one, L2, tests the constrained model, equation (8) against the
unconstrained reduced form, eqtiation (5) ; it shows therefore whether the constraints

imposed by the structural model on the distributed lag on shipments are rejected by
the data. Other things equal, high values of Li and low values of L2 are good news
for the structural model.

Examining first the values of Li and L2 suggests the following conclusions.
Overall the structural model performs well in approximately two thirds of the
sectors. Looking at Li, the constrained model significantly outperforms (at the 5/.

level) a model with no role for shipments in 9 out of the 13 sectors. In 4 sectors
(FO,PA,CH,AC), the constrained distributed lag on shipments does not help predict
investment. Looking at L2, the restrictions imposed by the structural model are
significantly rejected in 6 of the sectors at the 57. level, and in 3 of them (PA,EM,
MV) at the ii level.

Turning to the coefficients, the structural model is often successful at
replicating the unconstrained distributed lag structure (SCG, NEM in particular). The
model is able in most sectors to generate a flat, or slightly hump shaped distributed
lag structure.

Being able to replicate approximately the reduced form is only good news if the
underlying estimated structural parameters make sense. These are given in table 9.
Consider first the order expenditure lag structure implied by the estimates of
and w. Apart from a few outliers, the results imply a relatively flat order
expenditure structure, which corresponds well to the available qualitative evidence

A
From the estimates of (Aot) and (O—X), and the values of

from table 1 and of 8

from table A, we construct two estimates of the gap parameter X. The first one, X1 is

A

obtained by dividing the estimated (Xot) by , and is therefore derived from the

response of investment to movements in shipments. The second one, X2, is obtained by
subtracting from 8 the estimated ($—X), and is therefore obtained from the effect of

the lagged capital stock on investment. X and X2 are reported in the last two
columns of table 9 (they are measured at annual rates. Thus, an estimated value of X,
X, implies that investment responds within a quarter to close a proportion (X/4) of
the gap between desired and actual capital.

The estimated value X varies between —.05 and .35. The estimated value of X2
varies between .08 and .17. The average value of X1 is equal to .19 (so that
approximately 57.

of the gap is closed within the quarter) and is higher than the

average value of X, .12 .

This result is interesting. One interpretation is that it

captures the notion that investment overreacts to sales. Consider for example the
case of motor vehicles

we have seen that the sales process is not very persistent

but that the effect of shipments on investment is large. The structural model
estiamtes therefore a large value of X1, consistent with low costs of adjustment.
But, if costs of adjustment were low, the effect of the lagged capital stock on
investment should be strongly negative and X2 should be large. Such is not the case
in this sense investment appears to overreact to sales. But the result that X1
exceeds k2 can also be due to the use of a proxy for the correct capital stock
series, which leads to a bias towards zero in its coefficient, and in turn to a
downwards bias in X2

Section 6. Conclusion

We set out to give a structural interpretation to the distributed lag relation
between investment and shipments at the 2 digit level. We have learned the following

(1) Examination of the reduced form in section 2 reveals that there is no
standard and robust accelerator relation between investment and shipments at that
level of disaggregation. The relation between investment and shipments varies

,-'

substantially

across sectors. In all sectors, a good part of investment is not

explained by shipments ; indeed, in a few cases, there is no significant effect of
shipments on investment.

When shipments affect investment, they do so through a long and rather flat, or
hump shaped, distributed lag.

(2) Because the composition of capital is very similar across sectors, delivery
lag structures facing each sector are also very similar. All industries except

Petroleum face a mean delivery lag of approximately 3 quarters. Differences in
delivery lags are therefore unlikely candidates to explain differences in the effects
of shipments on investment across sectors.

A byproduct of our work on delivery lags is also to show that they appear
procyclical. This suggests a non—linear specification of the effect of shipments on
investment that we do not pursue further in this paper.
(3) Shipments follow very different processes across sectors. The processes

differ significantly in their dearee of persistence. There is a relation, although
not a tight one, between the degree of persistence of shipments and the size of the
effect of shipments on investment. This suQgests that the distributed lag in the
investment equation depends on the characteristics of the sales process in a way
which is at least qualitatively consistent with the theory.
(4) The results of estimation of the structural model in section 5 suggest that

the following model can generate roughly the distributed lag structure found in the
data. Firms face delivery lags of 3 quarters. They also face adjustment costs, which
imply

(1) they take all future expected sales, with discount factor .9, into

consideration when constructing the desired capital stock ; and (2) they close 5 of
the gap between desired and actual capital stock each quarter. They pay for orders at
a constant rate between the time of order and the time of delivery.

(5) While

this model can generate the long, flat or hump—shaped, distributed lag

found in the data, the ability of the structural model to fit each sector and to give
plausible explanations to differences across sectors is limited. The model performs
poorly in some sectors. It does not attribute differences in distributed lags across
sectors to any single main cause, such as differences in sales processes. In
particular, it attributes these differences in part to differences in both costs of
adjustment and in order expenditure lags. Although we do not have direct evidence on
these costs of adjustment, it is not clear why —especially given that capital
composition and delivery lags are so similar across sectors— costs of adjustment or
order—expenditure lags should differ substantially across sectors. It would be
interesting to examine formally how much of the differences across sectors could be
explained by differences in any one element, for example differences in shipment
processes with identical technologies (up to a capital shipment ratio) across
sectors. We have not done it yet.
(6) We set up estimation of the

structural model so

as to get two separate

estimates of the gap parameter. A comparison of these estimates shows the estimate
obtained from the response to shipments often exceeds the one obtained from the
response of investment to the lagged capital stock. The result may be explained by
bias from the presence of errors in variables ; if not, it may indicate an
overreaction of investment to shipments. While this result is suggestive, our model
is too crude and ignores too many factors, and the difference between the two
estimates often too small for us to push it too strongly.

Discrepancies between establishment and company based data
Investment expenditures are collected on a company basis ; shipments
and orders are collected on an establishment basis. 4 company may operate
in sectors other than its main sector of activity. Information about
activities of companies classified in a given sector can be obtained by
computing the ratio of employees of these companies working in the sector

to the total number of employees of these companies, using the Enterprise
Statistics from the Department of Commerce and aggregating to the 2—digit
level. This ratio is over 737.

in

all sectors except Petroleum (67%) and

Motor Vehicles (597.). Employees in Motor Vehicles companies not working
in the sector work however in sectors closely related to Motor Vehicles.
Such is not the case for Petroleum.

Construction of Investment , Shipments and Orders

Investment series are directly obtained from El]. Real shipments and
orders series are obtained by deflation of series in [2] by price

deflators constructed by aggregation of 3—digit deflators in [3], and by
time aggregation from monthly to quarterly and transformation to annual
rates.

Construction of the capital stock series
Time series for sectoral capital stocks are constructed using the
following accumulation equation
=

(l—€3)K_

+

where $ is the depreciation rate for capital of sector i. The
construction of $ is described in appendix B.
The series is benchmarked so that the mean level of the capital
stock is equal to the mean level of investment expenditures divided by
the rate of growth of investment plus the rate of depreciation. This mean
capital stock value is used in table 1 to compute the mean
capital/shipments ratio, as the ratio of mean capital to mean shipments.

A4

This crude computation of the mean level of capital car be compared
to ratios using alternative establishment based measures of capital, such
as those given in [6]. Columns 4 and 5 of table A below give respectively
our estimated mean capital shipments ratio and the mean capital shipments
ratio implied by [6](The two definitions of capital differ slightly and
the results are not strictly comparable). The main discrepancy is for
Petroleum, due to the establishment/company discrepancy discussed above.

Appendix B. Delivery lags

Construction of capital composition
Let i denote the sector, i denote the type of capital good, which
may be either a type of equipment or a structure. Let

gjj,

K

be respectively the depreciation rate, the rate of growth of capital, the
rate of investment arid the level of capital of type i in sector i. For a

given year, the following two identities hold

— (l—E3)K(—1)

=

V J..

The above identities imply
=

C

/EE(C1+g)/(g+$)) I]

This is the formula we use to compute capital composition. We

compute the composition for two different years 1967 and 1972 and then
take the average.

Data for I are obtained by aggregation of capital flow

tables [J.

Rates of growth g are assumed, for a given sector, to be the same
across all types of equipment. Thus for each sector i, only two values of

g are computed, one for equipment and one for structures. These are
computed using net capital measures from [6].

Rates of depreciation O for each type of equipment are assumed to
be independent of the sector in which equipment is used. Thus, for

equipment, C 8 for all i. Depreciation rates for each type of
capital equipment are obtained from average lives, L, from IRS Bulletin
F lives (table 3 in [6]). These average lives are given in column I of

table A. Depreciation rates $ are then constructed as 2/Li.
Rates of depreciation of structures are allowed to differ across

sectors of destination. Average lives of structures for each sector, L,
are computed using structure composition from [4] and lives by type of

structure from table 3 in 16]. These average lives are given in column 2
of

table

A. Depreciation rates are computed as 2/L1

The implied sectoral capital compositions are reported in table 3 in
the text.

Finally, the sector specific depreciation rates used to compute the
time series for capital in each sector,

Vj —

are computed as

The constructed depreciation rates are given in column 3 of table 4.

Construction of delivery lags by type of qood

Delivery lags are computed using the formula V/(1—b)S, where V1,
b and S1 are respectively unfilled orders, shipments and the proportion

of shipments sold to wholesalers and retailers. V and S are obtained
from the [7] for 1977 and b1 is obtained from table 13a in [7]. The
values of b1 are 467. for FM, 42 for NEM and 467. for EM. The implied

delivery lags can be compared to estimates by the Department of Commerce
(Survey of Current Business, July 1975) using a different approach ; they
are very similar.

Footnotes

Even if we take as given that investment depends on demand, there are three

1.

possible candidates, production, orders and sales (shipments). Production data must
be constructed using finished goods inventory data and are not of high quality. This
leaves orders or shipments. Which one is appropriate depends on the technology. If
the technology is a "referee report' technology in which orders are shelved until

processed, capital requirements are more closely related to shipments. If the
technology is a "pipeline" technology, in which production takes time and production
starts upon receipt of orders, orders are more appropriate. Not knowing what
technology is more appropriate, we have done estimation both using shipments and

using orders. Because of space constraints, we only report results using shipments

results

here ;
2.

using orders are not qualitatively different.

To state more explicitly our position, we believe that the relation from

shipments to investment is indeed largely causal (see Blanchard (1986))

we believe

that the cost of capital affects investment, but our reading of empirical work is
that leaving it out is unlikely to bias the coefficients on sales substantially.
3.

If o and X are the parameters obtained from the standard quadratic cost of

adjustment model, they depend on the rate at which the firm discounts profits ,, and
on the degree of convexity of the cost function and of costs of adjustment. They are
related by the following

X =

i—(aI).

We do not impose this relation in what

follows
4.

Jorgenson and Stephenson (1967) also assume that n periods elapse between the

ordering of capital and the first arrival of capital. An extension would be to allow
for different delivery laos. However, doing so is interesting only if capital is

heterogenous. See Lucas (196) for a discussion. This leads to too complex an
empirical specification.

5.

The use c-f

approximate"

is

due to the fact that, in ing from the structural

model to (5), two appr-o:mations are made. One is the use of K as an empirical

counterpart to the variable implied by (I) to (4), which is unobservable. The other

is in the approximation by an AR(1) of the process ollowed by the disturbance term.
This is further discussed in Section 5.
6.

Because

denotes the ratio o capital to annual shipments, X is also expressed

at annual rates. That is, for a given value X, investment will close during a quarter

(X/4) of the dierence between desired and actual capital. This is why the number 4
rather than 1 appears in the tent.
7.

This result, which initially surprised us, is in fact consistent with previous

studies at the sectoral level (see for example references in the surveys by Jorgenson
(1971) and Uri(1982)). These studies usually report the R2 on the original variables,

which is obviously much higher. In our case for example, it always exceeds .9.
B.

I-f we recognized explicitly the heterogeneity of capital in our model of

investment and assumed for e>ample the technology to be Leantief in the various types
of capital, the longest delivery lag would be more relevant than the mean lag.
Sectors would still look fairly similar.
9.

Because we do not make any explicit correction for the fact that production is

partly to stock, or equivalently that some of the orders are satisfied without lag
from the shelf, the estimated mean lag is much shorter than the estimated delivery
lag constructed earlier.
10.

This joint assumption implies that investment should not help predict sales

given past sales and is thus testable. It is rejected in three sectors at the 57.
level, and in two (Petroleum, Aircraft) at the 17. level. Thus, for these two sectors,

the results below are biased. For the other ten sectors, the assumption in the text
is an acceptable first approximation.

11.

We have also done estimation assuming n 4 and n= for Petroleum. The

differences are not substantial.
12.

Thus, rather than estimating (6) and (B) simultaneously, we first estimate (6)

and replace A in (B) by its estimated counterpart. This procedure is much cheaper as
the first estimation is linear but is less asymptotically efficient.
13.

The difficulty of

estimating

precisely the discount rate in that type of

estimation has often been documented.
14.

The likelihood function is maximized using Davidon—Fletcher—Fowell until

convergence. Newton—Raphson is then used to obtain an estimate of the covariance
matrix of the estimated parameters.
