    "abstract": "\n\nThis article presents the eqregsel command for implementing the estimation and bootstrap inference of sample selection models via extremal quantile regression. The command estimates a semiparametric sample selection model without instrument or large support regressor, and outputs the point estimates of the homogenous linear coefficients, their bootstrap standard errors, as well as the p-value for a specification test.\n\n",
