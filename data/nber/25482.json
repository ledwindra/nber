    "abstract": "\n\nWe study how different forms of communication influence inflation expectations in a randomized controlled trial using nearly 20,000 U.S. individuals. We elicit individuals\u2019 inflation expectations in the Nielsen Homescan panel and then provide eight different forms of information regarding inflation. Reading the actual Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement has about the same average effect on expectations as simply being told about the Federal Reserve\u2019s inflation target. Reading news articles about the most recent FOMC meetings results in a forecast revision which is smaller by half. This exogenous variation in inflation expectations has subsequent effects on household spending. Our results have implications for how central banks should communicate to the broader public.\n\n",
