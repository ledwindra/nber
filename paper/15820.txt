Large Scale Institutional Changes: Land Demarcation Within the British Empire

ABSTRACT
This paper examines the economics of large scale institutional change by studying the adoption of
the land demarcation practices within the British Empire during the 17th through 19th Centuries.
The advantages of systematic, coordinated demarcation, such as with the rectangular survey, relative
to individualized, haphazard demarcation, such as with metes and bounds, for reducing transaction
costs were understood by this time and incorporated into British colonial policy. Still, there was considerable
variation in the institutions adopted even though that the regions had similar legal structures and immigrant
populations. We study the determinants of institutional change by developing an analytical framework,
deriving testable implications, and then analyzing a data set that includes U.S., Canadian, Australian,
and New Zealand temperate colonies using GIS data. We find that a simple framework that outlines
the costs and benefits of implementing the demarcation systems can explain the different institutions
that are observed. Once in place, these institutions persist, indicating a strong institutional path dependence
that can influence transaction costs, the extent of land markets, and the nature of resource use. The
agricultural land institutions that we examine remain in force today, in some cases over 300 years
later. In this regard, institutions of land are durable, much as are other institutions, such as language
and law.

[I]n the absence of transaction costs, it does not matter what the law is, since people can
always negotiate without cost to acquire, subdivide, and combine rights whenever this
would increase the value of production. In such a world the institutions which make up the
economic system have neither substance nor purpose.

I will only repeat the expression of my confident trust that you have sacrificed everything
else to the one essential thing--the survey, the survey, the survey.

I. INTRODUCTION
Institutions can change in dramatic fashion. For example, after conquest the victor
can institute its language, law, currency, economic organizations, and form of government
on the vanquished. In so doing it expands its institutional reach.3 Among these new
institutions are those that govern land, perhaps the most fundamental of resources. A
conquering regime can decide how property rights to land will be demarcated and assigned.
Once implemented, absent another dramatic change, these institutions can persist.
In this paper, we examine the adoption of land demarcation systems within the
British Empire in the 17th through 19th centuries. We focus on temperate colonies settled by
British emigrants in North America, Australia, and New Zealand.4 The role of colonial
emigration, as well as optimal land distribution and demarcation in the colonies were
debated by leading political economists, including Adam Smith, Jeremy Bentham, John
Stuart Mill, Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, Edward Wakefield, and Robert Torrens
(Winch 1965). The British Colonial Office (Labaree 1967, Vol. 2) and especially

History is replete with such conquests and expansions – from Ancient Rome two millennia ago, to the
British Empire between the 17th and 20th centuries, to the Soviet regime of the 20th century.

In this regard, we follow Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001) and Crosby (1986) who also focus on the
"Neo-Europes" where settlers tried to replicate European institutions. Primary examples of this include
Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States.

Wakefield (1834) called for synchronized, planned settlement and land demarcation. As we
show, however, there was considerable variation in the institutions actually adopted and we
analyze the causes of that variation.
In his pioneering work Coase (1937, 1960, 1989) was first to develop (or imply) a
theory of institutional choice when posting that judges choose the most efficient legal
regimes. This work led to discussions of the evolution of legal rules and indeed to the law
and economics movement, and later to work on institutions by North (1990), North, Wallis,
and Weingast (2009), Acemoglu, Simon, and Robinson (2001, 2002, 2005), and others.
Moreover, as the quoted remark above notes Coase (1989) clearly understood that markets
themselves are institutions that facilitate trade and indeed “require the establishment of
legal rules” for them to function.5
Ironically, many of Coase’s most famous examples have to do with land. In “The
Problem of Social Cost” Coase used the example of land use conflicts between wheat
farmers and cattle ranchers and his examination of English law focused on nuisance (i.e.,
land use) disputes. In his theory he discussed the importance of the “delimitation of rights”
to land (1960, 8). Yet, Coase does not examine in detail how rights to land are actually
demarcated, nor does Coase acknowledge that the demarcation of land in his native
England is so different from his adopted home in Chicago. But, as Coase would certainly
acknowledge, the practicalities of land demarcation are fundamental because they mold
land markets and shape land use. Coase, of course, was not alone in overlooking land
demarcation. There is little legal or economic scholarship on the factors influencing

demarcation, and even major property law treatises (e.g., Dukeminier and Krier 2002,
Merrill and Smith 2007) merely describe the dominant American system.6
We begin by briefly summarizing land demarcation in the British Empire. In section
III we develop a framework for examining the decision to adopt particular demarcation
systems. In section IV we examine the implications of our framework by examining the
detailed history of land demarcation in the British colonies and by econometrically
examining the determinants of those institutional choices. We summarize our study in
section V.
II. LAND DEMARCATION IN THE BRITISH EMPIRE.
The British Isles comprise 121,673 square miles. At its peak, the British Empire
covered 14,200,000 square miles, nearly 25 percent of the world’s land area, and the
colonial area that we examine involved 10,692,968 square miles.7 The accumulation of
these vast expanses of land beyond the home islands generated the practical problems of
how to allocate this land and how it should be demarcated. These decisions were
influenced by the institutions that were developing within Britain at the time of expansion
and the political economy debates that emerged around colonial policies.
A. The British Isles.
By the mid 17th century, land in Britain was becoming more valuable and this led to
changes in land institutions from traditional practices that subsequently influenced British
colonial policy. For example, the enclosures of scattered and common lands helped to
6

Neither of the comprehensive treatises on law and economics by Posner (2002) and Shavell (2007) mentions
land demarcation. Demarcation, on the other hand, is examined by economic geographers in describing the
use of mapping and cadaster systems. For example, see Scott (1998) and Kain and Baigent (1992). Libecap
and Lueck (2009) and Libecap, Lueck and Lopes (2010) find that there are economically and statistically
significant gains in land values from enactment of a systematic, rectangular survey in the United States.
7
By comparison Africa comprises just 20 percent of the earth and Russia, the largest country is about 11
percent of the Earth. The total land area of the Earth is 57,308,738 square miles

restructure, reshape, and consolidate plots into more useful forms for sheep raising and
larger-scale food production. Land that previously had been held and worked in common or
in strips was reorganized into plots owned in severalty and in some cases merged into
rectangular forms that were recognized as beneficial for production and trading.8 Land
markets, which historically had been local and limited, became more active and broadly
based (Darby, 1973, 302-53). To promote trades, Parliament intervened between 1660 and
1830 with roughly 3,500 Estate Acts to free property rights from traditional constraints of
inheritance and other communal requirements (Bogart and Richardson 2009, 3; Richardson
and Bogart 2008, 7-18).
These changes in land institutions required more accurate measurement and
boundary definition and standardization of processes. More precise survey was made
possible with new procedures and equipment, particularly the introduction of Gunter’s
chain in 1620, which spread throughout England and subsequently, to the English colonies.
Gunter’s chain helped to generalize use of a standard statute rod of 16 ½ feet for land
measurement by surveyors. Other new equipment and practices included the Theodolite
survey, use of telescopes, the solar compass, and triangulation survey emerged over time
and influenced the costs and benefits of various demarcation systems.9

a result of some enclosures is noted by Yelling (1977, 120, 123, 131, 138). For additional discussion of the
geography of enclosure, see Kain, Chapman, and Oliver (2004). Scott (1998) 24-49 discusses the expansion
of survey and drafting of cadastral maps in the 17th-19th centuries.

Richeson (1996, 140-75) discusses the introduction and spread of Gunter’s chain as well as other survey
innovations. Linklater (2002, 13-20) describes the impact of Gunter’s chain on measurement and the
opportunity to firm private property rights to land.

British immigrants. Abundant land in these regions offered the possibility of transplanting
British farms, agricultural practices, crops, and land institutions. The question of how to
design and manage colonization became part of British political economy debates in the
18th and 19th centuries.
[Figure 1 here]
One issue was whether land should be allocated in a decentralized, unsystematic
manner, with individual land claims and demarcation through traditional English metes and
bounds. "Metes" refers to property boundaries defined by the measurement of distances
between terminal points, and "bounds" refers to boundary descriptions based on
topography. Under metes and bounds demarcation, parcels were surveyed independently
after settlement and generally resulted in non-uniform, uncoordinated shapes, sizes, and
alignment.10
An alternative was to allocate and demarcate land in a more organized, systematic
manner, with the survey of land parcels prior to distribution. Coordinated demarcation
could be within a local area, organized by a particular colonial group or large land owner,
or it might be broader, covering a larger jurisdiction, organized by a government. The
rectangular grid was favored. 11 Colonial towns often were laid out with square blocks
(Thrower, 1966, 9), and Robert Torrens and Edward Gibbon Wakefield, two important 19th
century political economists and politicians, called for the strictly planned distribution of all
10

See Libecap and Lueck (2009) for a discussion; also see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metes_and_bounds .
The rectangular grid or rectangular survey (RS) is system of rectangles established to locate and specify
boundaries for land parcels. In the U.S. Public Lands System Survey, the RS divides land into townships of 6
miles square, bounded by base lines running east and west, and meridians running north and south.
Townships are further divided into 36 sections, each one mile square. Sections can be subdivided into quarter
sections, quarter-quarter sections, and so on: http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/boundaries/a_plss.html. A
survey technique that used in the 19th century was triangulation http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation.
Triangulation involves measurement of the angles of a series of triangles to fix property location and
boundaries. If done in an organized manner, parcels could be demarcated with respect to one another.

colonial agricultural land and controlled settlement to create productive colonies (Winch
1965, 56-93).12 One element of Wakefield’s Colonial Reform Movement was the survey of
land into squares prior to sale an occupation (Winch, 1965, 113-45; Oldham, 1917, 4, 16,
74; Burroughs, 1967, 12-3). Squares offered potential productivity gains as well as clear
boundaries and uniform parcels for exchange in land markets.13 Wakefield argued that
allowing individualized claiming and demarcation with uncoordinated metes and bounds
would lead to confusion, a lack of organization, and failure. The interests of individuals to
independently claim land would diverge from the broader interests of colonial society,
which would be molded by the way in which land was demarcated (Winch 1965, 137).
The potential benefits of more centrally-controlled, planned demarcation were
incorporated into circulars issued by the British Colonial Office in the late 17th and 18th
centuries:
First, that you, our said governor….of our lands for the [northern, southern] district
of North America….taking care that such districts so to be surveyed and laid out as
aforesaid be divided into such a number of lots (each lot to contain not less than
one hundred nor more than one thousand acres) as our survey general shall judge
best adapted to the nature and situation of the districts so to be surveyed….That so
soon as the said survey shall have been made and returned as aforesaid, you, our
said governor or commander in chief of our said province….appoint such time and
place for the sale and disposal of the lands contained within the said survey to the
best bidder …”.14

12

Torrens, originally from Ireland, became Premier of South Australia and later a member of the British
Parliament. He is widely known for creating the system of land registrations that goes by his name.
Wakefield was a leading colonial policy theorist especially for the centralized demarcation of lands in South
Australia, New Zealand, and later Canada. He was a Director of the New Zealand Company, co founder of the
Colonial Reform Movement, and a member of the New Zealand Parliament.
13
Other aspects of the Colonial Reform Movement included constraints on the supply of new lands made
available at any point in time and high fixed prices. Studies by Barnes (1935) and Lee and Sallee (1974) show
production advantages in rectangular fields where the farmer works parallel to the longest sides of the field.

The potential advantages of the broad, uniform rectilinear demarcation of land also
were recognized in the U.S. at the end of the colonial period during Congressional debates
over the Land Ordinance of May 20, 1785 that ultimately resulted in the Public Lands
Survey System.15 Congress rejected metes and bounds and instead called for survey before
occupation with properties to be marked in squares, aligned with each other, “so that no
land would be left vacant,” to prevent overlapping claims, and to simplify registering deeds
(Linklater, 2002, 68-70; White, 1983, 9).
III. A FRAMEWORK FOR EXAMINING INSTITUTIONAL CHOICE
In this section we examine the decision to adopt a particular land demarcation
system. We first examine the simple stylized choice between a rectangular system (RS)
and metes and bounds (MB). This analysis allows general predictions about the choice
between these two dominant demarcation institutions. We then extend our model to
consider the choice among these two regimes and a third intermediate regime also used in
the British Empire.16
To begin, it is apparent that there are potential gains from centralized demarcation
(Libecap and Lueck 2009). First, there can be enforcement cost savings from coordinating
common borders, eliminating gaps of unclaimed land, and clarifying boundaries. Second,
similarly aligned properties will eliminate oddly-shaped, unproductive parcels that arise
with unsynchronized demarcation of large areas. Third, a common demarcation pattern
provides information about the position of individual parcels. This information reduces
potential for overlapping and conflicting claims; allows for a common address system; and
importantly, lowers transaction costs, promoting land markets. Fourth, coordinated

Our model follows Libecap and Lueck (2009).

demarcation is a public good network that will have greater value as it is spread over a
larger region.
An organized system with uniform parcels, such as the rectangular grid, provides
the largest benefits with similarly shaped, sized, and aligned parcels, but it potentially
entails higher costs than does an organized/non uniform system that has fewer constraints
on parcel size and shape. An organized/non uniform system, however, provides fewer
coordination benefits because parcels are no longer necessarily similar in shape and size.
The third option, an unorganized metes and bounds demarcation system does not provide
any of the benefits of organized demarcation, but it avoids the costs of controlled entry and
delayed settlement and production until survey.
The economic decision to adopt a coordinated rectangular demarcation system
relative to metes and bounds can be examined by comparing the total value of land under
both arrangements. This expression is the sum of parcel values, less the costs of the systems
themselves. Assume the Empire is considering land demarcation for a region (e.g., a
colony) that is A acres in size. We incorporate a temporal dimension to account for
difference in system setup and continuation costs.
Under metes and bounds (MB) the net value of the land is the sum of individual
values and costs, less the continuing costs associated with adjustments resulting from the
lack of coordination, so that the total present value of the land in the region is

where Vτ* ( A, t ) is the optimal parcel value under MB at time τ, T is the time horizon, t is a
parameter measuring topography which varies along the interval (0,1) where 0 is flat and

most valuable and 1 is vertical and least valuable, r is a discount rate, c0(A,t) is the onetime demarcation cost function, and CτMB ( A, t ) ≥ 0 are the continuing costs of MB,
including individual enforcement, border disputes, and misaligned parcels. Under MB land
demarcation and output begin immediately at time τ = 0 and the continuing costs associated
with MB are assumed to be increasing in the size of the region (A) and rising over time (τ)
as these problems accumulate.
Under a rectangular system (RS) the net value of land reflects the value of the
network benefits of the system, such as the public goods of common addresses, survey
coordination, as well as standardized, aligned, and fixed parcel boundaries. These network
and coordination benefits come, however, at the cost of a necessarily extensive system, in
which there are upfront costs of design, survey, and controlling access until demarcation is
completed.17
Individual land claimants under RS do not face demarcation costs as with MB, so
the total present value of the land in the region governed by RS is

Network effects are incorporated into the land value function, which is increasing in the
area governed by the regime A and because Vτ ( A, t ) > Vτ* ( A, t ) . The RS system costs are
increasing in A, but at a decreasing rate, revealing network economies. These costs are also

(formal-legal) trading systems, where the latter have greater setup costs like RS.

This difference has four terms that illustrate the tradeoffs between a rectangular
system and metes and bounds. The first term comprises the network gains from RS over
MB. The second term is the gains from MB that would be sacrificed during the period the
RS is being implemented, in terms of output under metes and bounds and rectangular
system setup costs. The third term is the foregone individual demarcation costs under MB
not required under RS, and the fourth term is the avoided continued costs of MB over the
time horizon. From (3) comparatives statics emerge: the net value of RS will increase in
the size of the governed land area (A), increase in the expected time horizon (T), and
decrease in the time of RS implementation (τ). We thus expect the Empire is more likely to
choose a rectangular land demarcation system when: a) the larger are the tracts of land
under its control; b) the longer is the expected time horizon of its control; c) the more
quickly the system can be implemented; and d) the greater the network benefits among the
parties.
Considering forces likely to change the model parameters can illuminate these
predictions. For instance, more rugged topography would reduce net gains from a
rectangular system by increasing the costs and time of implementation and perhaps even by
reducing the losses of sub-optimal parcel shape. Similarly a region with no recognized
18

These effects are greater than with MB because more rigid squares are required, relative to flexible parcel
shapes under MB.

10

incumbent demarcation system existed will have lower rectangular system implementation
costs. Third, greater political authority by the Empire and cohesion among the population
will increase the expected time horizon of control, lower implementation times, and hence,
make the adoption of a rectangular system more likely.
We now modify this framework to more closely link it to land demarcation regimes
used within the temperate regions of the British Empire. As we discuss in detail in the next
section, not only were RS and MB chosen but a third hybrid regime was also implemented
as implied above. Table 1 summarizes these three demarcation regimes: the rectangular
systems (RS), a hybrid or mixed system (MX), and metes and bounds (MB). The second
regime can be generally characterized as providing some network benefits through planned
demarcation and prior survey that are lower than RS because of the lack of parcel
uniformity, but in certain environments had lower upfront survey costs due to less rigidity
in parcel size, shape and arrangement.
[Table 1 here]
The value generated by the third hybrid regime (MX) can be seen as a modification
of (3). Relative to MB, the hybrid has higher network gains as indicated in the first term
because it is planned and coordinated, but fewer than those offered by RS because of
varying plot sizes and shapes. The gains from MB, as indicated in the second term are
lower relative to MX as compared to RS, because the former has more flexible shapes and
hence possibly lower set up times. The third and fourth terms, foregone individual
demarcation costs, and avoided continued costs under MB are generally the same as with
RS. The major difference then between RS and MX is that the former standardizes

11

information through parcel uniformity, at the expense of a more rigid structure of its
upfront costs.
Several predictions follow and are merely extensions of those derived above and are
expected to be tightly connected to heterogeneity in the land and potential inhabitants. The
Empire is more likely to choose the hybrid demarcation system a) the smaller and more
variable in quality and topography are the tracts of land under its control; b) the shorter is
the expected time horizon of its control; and c) the longer it takes for the colony-wide
system can be implemented.
IV. EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS.
To test these predictions about the choice in land demarcation institutions in the
British Empire we employ two methods. First, we examine the history of colonial land
demarcation by examining the literature and the contemporary political debates. Second,
we assemble a data base at the colonial level which includes information on demarcation
institutions and on exogenous land characteristics.
A. Framework Predictions and Demarcation across the Temperate Colonies.
The framework predicts that time of ownership or control by the Empire and the
lack of incumbent demarcation practices should raise the likelihood of observing systematic
demarcation, such as the rectangular survey. These two factors did not vary across the
temperate colonies. By the time Britain was establishing its North American, Australian,
and New Zealand colonies in the 17th-19th centuries, it was the premier world power, and
this did not change significantly until WWI. Britain was the home of the industrial
revolution beginning in the 18th century; it defeated the Dutch and France in North America
between 1664 and 1763; and faced no serious competition in Australia or New Zealand.

12

Spain, another potential competitor, was driven from most of its western hemisphere
colonies between 1810 and 1825. Accordingly, Britain had secure control over its colonial
territories, increasing the expected time path of returns of implementing new institutional
forms.
In terms of local demarcation practices, indigenous peoples tended to be sparsely
populated without formal demarcation of the land at least that was generally adhered to by
Britain. The groups were militarily defeated, allowing the Britain to implement British
land demarcation institutions across its temperate colonies (Linklater 2002, 24-40).19
The other factors described in the framework, however, do vary across the colonies,
and we use this information to explain differences in observed land institutions. Although
colonial towns often were laid out with lots following a rectangular grid, the demarcation of
agricultural lands did not have such uniformity. Table 2 describes the different institutions
found in the temperate colonies, following the classifications described above and
organized by system.
[Table 2 here]
Figures 2 and 3 show examples of varying demarcation across the Empire. The
discussion of practices across the colonies is ordered according to the type of regime that
prevailed in each. Among the variables identified in the framework developed above,
historical narratives provide information on the roles of a). Control over land and the
population so that survey could precede settlement; b). Time of settlement that indicates
access to newer more accurate survey techniques and equipment that lower the costs of RS;

19

In the colonial period, only in New Zealand in the North Island were population numbers sufficiently large
that natives had more political and military power requiring accommodation. See Hailey (1938, 713).
Population estimates for the temperate colonies at the time of settlement are limited. Some sources include
Borah (1976, 13-34), Pool (1977), Vamplew (1987).

13

c). Terrain that influences both the costs of survey and monitoring control over settlement,
as well as the returns to systematic demarcation if rough terrain reduces potential
agricultural land value; and d). Soil quality that influences agricultural land values, farm
size, and population densities. The network gains provided by RS increase in the number
of parcels and farms and decline with lower intrinsic land value due to soil quality.
[Figures 2and 3 here]
MB: The Southern American Colonies, the Middle Atlantic Colonies, New
South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland, and Western Australia.
These were all relatively early colonies, most established in the 17th and early 18th
centuries so that settlement and demarcation took place with more primitive, costly survey
instruments, making RS more difficult. Although there were early plans for more orderly,
coordinated settlement and land demarcation through RS in the Georgia and South
Carolina, these failed. 20 There was little control over claimants in the southern American
colonies. As colonial immigrants moved into the interior, land areas were indiscriminately
selected, settled, and then surveyed in a haphazard manner using metes and bounds. As a
result there was little consistency in parcel shapes, sizes, or alignment, and boundaries were
vague. Swamps and irregular terrain also made more systematic survey difficult (Linklater
2002, 32-40).
In the Middle Atlantic colonies, William Penn, who was granted the territory of
Pennsylvania in 1681, also had envisioned an orderly land distribution with contiguous tiers
of townships of 5,000 acres square, surveyed prior to settlement, moving west from the
Delaware River as RS. But this generally did not occur in Pennsylvania or elsewhere in

Marschner (1960, 22-24, 33-36), Kain and Baigent (1992, 269-76), Price (1995, 97 on free choice; see also
7, 15-18, 87-205 for discussion of the southern colonies), Thrower (1966, 10), Johnson (1957, 22), Kinda
(2001, 143), Mitchell (1983).

14

New Jersey, New York, and Delaware where there was only loose central control over the
distribution of land, and parcels were haphazardly defined prior to survey as MB
(Marschner 1960, 2734, 35; Price 1995, 212). The challenges of rough terrain and variable
land quality for systematic demarcation in RS were noted by a surveyor in Lancaster
County, Pennsylvania: “the habitable land lyes so in patches among the mountains and
barrens that one tract canot always (nor often) lye contiguous with another, for that reason
alone it will be very much to your loss if every man be allowed to take what quantity he
things fit…And this I fear will often be the case if the warrants are issued before the tracts
are survey’d.”21
Limited control, rough terrain and variable soil quality also led to MB in the early
Australia colonies of New South Wales (1770), Tasmania (1803), Queensland (a part of
New South Wales until 1859), and Western Australia (1826). New South Wales and
Tasmania began as penal colonies for Britain and not initially as locations for emigration to
new land. As a result, there was little constraint on internal migration and land claims.
Although instructions to colonial governors called for British institutions to be
implemented for planned centralized allocation and survey of land into small farms under
RS, claiming and demarcation instead was much more ad hoc under metes and bounds.
In the interior, terrain was rough and in New South Wales, semi aridity resulted in
large parcels being claimed and a dispersed population, reducing potential network gains
from RS (Jeans 1966, 125-7; Jeans 1967, 243-54; Kain and Baigent 1992, 307-10). Efforts
to implement Wakefield’s plans for systematic survey and distribution via RS in 1821,
failed.22 Tasmania, or Van Diemen’s Land, was administered as part of New South Wales

until 1824 with little planning or control over settlement or coordinated demarcation (Kain
and Baigent 1992, 307; Jones 1989, 41). As predicted, rugged terrain raised the costs of
developing townships with systematic rectangular survey.23 Most arable land was occupied
by individuals and then surveyed under MB. The same terrain problems and lack of control
over land claiming in Queensland led to the dominance of MB in that colony
(Jeans,1966,122-23; Kain and Baigent,1992, 307). Although not adjacent to New South
Wales, Western Australia faced similar problems of settlement prior to survey, coupled
with very dry terrain and mixed soil quality that did not blend with a small, uniform land
distribution policy.24
Mixed: New England, Nova Scotia, Quebec, and New Zealand.
In terms of timing all, but New Zealand (largely settled in the 19th century), were
very early colonies dating from the 17th century.25 Quebec was colonized beginning in 1608
by France and French land demarcation was incorporated by the British. This timing
suggests more primitive survey practices, which all things equal, would reduce the use of
RS. These colonies also generally had rough terrain that raised survey costs. What
distinguishes them from the previous group was greater control over land settlement and
demarcation. In these colonies, survey occurred first before occupation, but terrain appears
to have limited the use of RS. The result was a mixed demarcation system that varied
across the colonies.

Jeans (1975, 3-5) discusses the general problem in Australia of limited good farm land and dry conditions
that favored pastoral pursuits, rather than farming. For problems in Queensland and Western Australia with
squatting and “free homesteading, see Williams (1975, 94). See Kain and Baigent (1992, 307, 309) for
reference to unregulated distribution of land in huge parcels in West Australia (Swan River colony).
25
New England included Massachusetts (1620, Plymouth, 1628, Massachusetts Bay Colony), Maine (1622),
New Hampshire (1623), Rhode Island (1636), and Connecticut (1633). Nova Scotia was (1621), while New
Zealand settlement largely occurred in the 19th century after 1838.

16

In New England land was demarcated into (generally) square townships of 6 to 10
miles and internally divided into town lots and agricultural plots, including common fields.
Proprietors distributed land to the township inhabitants. Within the township, properties
were not of equal size or uniform shape, but based on social standing, wealth, and family
size. Settlement was communal, often organized around religious groups from an existing
community in England (Marschner 1960, 24, 25; Egleston 1886, 21-22, 41-45; Price 1995,
13-14, 28-29; Kinda 2001, 142). As settlers moved into the interior, they petitioned
colonial governments for land grants that were distributed as new “towns” or townships
(Kain and Baigent 1992, 285-86; Egleston 1886, 15). Lands were to be collectively to
build a “compact state of freeholders” and were to be surveyed and marked within 12
months of the township grant. There was limited independent squatting on land (Egleston
1886, 15-18; Price 1995, 28-35.) Township locations were not coordinated and could be
scattered. This organized pattern of survey and demarcation tended to weaken as migration
moved further into the more rugged New England interior (Price 1995, 34-35).
Nova Scotia (1621) land demarcation patterns were similar to those in New England
with local townships. In some cases townships were large, of 100,000 acres given to a
collective group. Individual shares within the township could be up to 500 acres. The
external township lines were surveyed prior to the grant and the township community was
responsible for subdivision (Kinda (2001, 142), Thomson (1966, 118-120).
Quebec was made part of the British Empire in 1763 after the treaty of Paris. The
French crown granted land to seigneurs who subdivided their grants into individual plots of
60-100 acres in long narrow lots that fronted the St. Lawrence River. The seigneurs then
recruited colonists to occupy and rent their lands. In this way, the land was surveyed and

17

demarcated prior to settlement in a manner similar to townships in New England (Harris
and Guelke 1977, 135-53; Kain and Baigent1992, 276-98, 303; Thomson 1966, 38, 76-77).
Demarcation in New Zealand was affected by the control over settlement provided
both by Wakefield’s philosophies implemented by the New Zealand Land Company
organized in 1838 (Winch 1965, 111-13) and improvements in surveying with triangulation
that appeared by the 19th century. Indeed, RS was the initial plan. Six (and later 10)
provinces were established in New Zealand and each adopted a separate, but similar land
demarcation system: Wellington, Nelson, Taranaki, Otago, Canterbury, and Hawke’s Bay
(Scott 1998, 51; Kain and Baigent 1992, 318, 319).26 The New Zealand Company’s initial
RS system worked to some degree in Canterbury, which was relatively flat, but ran afoul of
rough terrain and other natural features that raised the costs of demarcating into square
sections elsewhere. An alternative standardized survey system with variable parcel sizes,
shapes, and alignment was adopted using triangulation. Triangulation provided systematic
location, addresses, and well defined boundaries. It was first used in Otago and spread
throughout all of New Zealand by 1876 (Kain and Baigent 1992, 320-24).
RS: Federal Public Lands, Canadian Dominion Lands, Ontario, New
Brunswick, South Australia, Victoria.
These regions were settled relatively later, generally in the late 18th and early to
mid19th centuries; are characterized by flat terrain and fertile soil; and by effective land
control. These factors appear to have encouraged survey prior to settlement into RS. There
was clear government authority in the U.S. under the Federal Land Ordinance of 1785
(Public Lands System Survey, PLSS), where land was surveyed into 6 by 6 mile townships
(480 chains per side) and subdivided into 36 sections of one square mile each before to sale
26

They were combined into a single colony in 1876. Through 1870 most agricultural settlement took place on
the South Island (Greasley and Oxley 2009, 326).

18

and settlement.27 The PLSS was inaugurated for the comparatively flat and rich soils of the
Midwest and gradually extended across the Great Plains. The rectangular survey was
adopted because of its ability to promote “…an orderly settlement of new lands,” prevent
the scattered and uneven claiming of only the best lands “…leaving vacant and
uncultivated, in such irregularity, small and incommodious parcells that it is thought
scarcely worth any one’s While….,” reduce land boundary conflicts and “prevent
innumerable frauds and enable us to save millions”, and importantly raise land values and
revenue “…these Lands will provide a considerable resource for sinking the national debt,
and, if rightly conducted, liten the burthens of our fellow-citizens on account of Taxes as
well as give relief to the creditors of the United States.”28
In Ontario (1763), flat, fertile land along the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River
also was demarcated in a grid with 6-mile square townships a standard, although there was
variation in township and subdivision size across the province. Near lakes, narrow,
rectangular long lots also were used (Kain and Baigent 1992, 298-303; Taylor 1945, 90-92;
Thomson 1966, 237-43). Similar demarcation was practiced in the south and east of the St.
Lawrence in Quebec, called the “Eastern Townships” and the colony of New Brunswick
(1784) (Kain and Baigent 1992, 298; Taylor 1945, 89; Thomson 1966, 99, 224-5; Schott
1980). The Dominion Land Survey (DLS), which began in1871, was implemented in the
Prairie Provinces of Canada to parallel the PLSS in the U.S. with land surveyed into 6-mile
square townships that were aligned and addressed along lines of latitude and longitude
(Kain and Baigent 1992, 303; McKercher 1986, 21; Taylor 1975, 11; MacGregor, 1981).
27

Linklater (2002, 69-72). As described by Pattison (1957, 49-51), the rectangular survey used Gunter’s chain
with 10 square chains to the acre; a mile divided into 80 chains; and a square mile in to 640 acres; White

In Victoria, Australia (separated from New South Wales in 1851) RS was used as
the agricultural frontier moved northwest beyond Port Philip (Melbourne) in the 1850s. The
main cadastral unit for surveying and mapping properties was the parish that varied in size
between 15 and 33 square miles. Some parish borders were aligned rectilinearly toward
magnetic north, similar to PLSS in the U.S. In the Melbourne-Colac-Geelong triangle to the
west of Melbourne, parishes were divided into sections of 640 acres and subdivisions of 80
and 40 acres (Kain and Baigent 1992, 311-13; Powell 1970, 51-68; 1975, 35).
South Australia (1834) was the definitive planned colony. Colonization was
organized after 1835 by the South Australian Land Company. Land was surveyed into
rectangular grids following Wakefield’s philosophy (Winch 1965, 97-110; Burroughs 1967,
179; Oldham 1917, 4, 10, 14; Wakefield 1834, 3-19). Wakefield wanted “…to prevent ‘a
few good judges of their own interests’ from buying up all the available profitable, waste
lands” and avoid the “injurious” dispersion of settlement where “each settler became the
proprietor of a small section of land; under such conditions society was impossible….29 A
land registry system designed by Robert Torrens to facilitate the clear assignment of land
rights and active land markets was adopted and represented a break from use of English
common law deeds of transfer (Kain and Baigent 1992, 313-17; Burroughs 1967, 179;
South Australia Department of Lands 1986, 8, 38; Powell, 1972).
The historical data are consistent with the framework in Section III. To more
precisely examine the effects of the variables described in the framework, we now turn to
econometric analysis of the adoption of a particular regime.

B . Econometric Analysis Using Data on Land Characteristics
Data and Descriptive Statistics
With the use of Geographic Information System (GIS) data, we compile a dataset of
land characteristics at the colonial level for each area listed in Table 2. Observations are
centered at the initial point of British settlement within the colony and include all land area
within a 50 mile radius. By overlaying publicly available spatial data we calculate
variables for terrain ruggedness, soil quality, area governed and year of settlement. Terrain
ruggedness is a measure of average surface slope in a region and is derived from 90m
digital elevation models (DEMs) generated by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission
(SRTM). Soil quality is the average of a seven-point score where a value of 1 indicates soil
unsuitable for agriculture and 7 indicates soil with unconstrained productivity. Source data
soil quality comes from the Global Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ) dataset. Area
governed represents the land area within the boundaries of the observation measured in
1,000 km2. More complete descriptions of how the variables were constructed can be
found in the Data Appendix.
Table 3 provides descriptive statistics for the variables in our analysis by
demarcation type. On average, RS is observed over large regions with relatively flat terrain
and above average soil quality, which seems to line up nicely with the historical analysis.
In addition, the reported means for settlement year suggest an increasing level of order and
uniformity in demarcation practices over time.
[Table 3 here]

21

Determinants of Adoption: OLS Estimates
To understand the relative importance of the variables in Table 3, we estimate the
decision to adopt a systematic demarcation system by ordinary least squares (OLS) from
the following linear regression model 30
(4)

‫ݕ‬௜ ൌ ߤ ൅ ߙܶ௜ ൅ ߛ‫ܮ‬௜ ൅ ߜܵ௜ ൅ ߠ‫ܦ‬௜ ൅ ߝ௜

where yi is an ordered outcome variable representing the adopted demarcation system in
colony i ordered by increasing uniformity. The regressor Ti measures terrain ruggedness in
colony i, Li is the area governed (size of colony or region), Si is soil quality, Di is the date
of initial settlement in years and εi is a random error term.
As seen in the historical analysis, accounting for political control and enforcement
of demarcation activities appears to play a role in whether a system can be implemented.
Areas lacking effective control will have higher costs of implementing systematic
demarcation and tend to favor MB by default. This presents a potential problem for
econometric interpretation if determinants of political control are correlated with the
determinants of adopting a particular system. Therefore we also test the regression model
on a restricted sample where pure MB observations are excluded. This ensures the
remaining observations are ones where a definitive level of control is observed. OLS
estimates for the full and restricted samples are reported in Table 4. Given the linear
model, we can loosely interpret the dependent variables as response probabilities and the
coefficients as marginal effects.31
[Table 4 here]

30

OLS regression is chosen over a maximum likelihood approach in this analysis because of its preferable
small sample properties.
31
In the case of the full sample, we can interpret the coefficients as two times the marginal effects.

22

The results show general consistency with our theoretical predictions and historical
analysis. Though not significant in the full sample, terrain ruggedness and soil quality have
the correct sign predicted from the theory. Terrain ruggedness becomes significant in the
restricted sample, perhaps as a result of reduced noise from removing uncontrolled MB
observations, and helps to verify the important impact terrain has on surveying costs. The
variable for area governed is positive and significant as predicted, and supports the
hypothesis that the gains from uniform demarcation increase with the size of the network.
The full sample coefficient implies that an increase in 2 million square kilometers,
approximately one standard deviation, should increase the likelihood of adopting an RS by
8%. The effect of area governed is slightly larger in the restricted sample and considerably
more significant. This possibly suggests that some larger regions in our sample where MB
is observed may have adopted an RS system had there been adequate initial control. Lastly,
we find a large and significant effect for the year of initial settlement in both samples. Our
main interpretation of this effect is that progressive development of survey technology over
time lowered the costs and implementation-time of systematic survey. To get a rough idea
of the magnitude of this effect, the results suggest that RS adoption in a frontier settlement
would be 15% more likely over a century's time within the time-frame of our sample.
V. CONCLUSION.
A half century has passed since Ronald Coase taught economists the importance of
the fundamental institutions that underlie markets. He pointed out the link between
property rights and transaction costs; how legal and other factors determine them; and how
these in turn shape economic outcomes. These insights have influenced subsequent work
of economists working on transaction costs, property rights, economic organization, and

23

development.32 Ironically, the institutions of land – one of Coase’s original examples –
have been neglected in the expansion of institutional economics.
In this paper we have examined the economic history of land demarcation in the
expansive British Empire, using the insights of Ronald Coase. We have developed an
economic framework for examining the decision to adopt a particular system of
demarcation of rights to land. Using that framework we have analyzed the variation in
institutions across the temperate British Empire, ranging from the systematic rectangular
survey to an organized hybrid, to unsystematic metes and bounds. This variation occurred
despite efforts by leading British political economists and colonial politicians, such as
Edward Gibbons Wakefield, as well as the British Colonial Office to implement a planned
and controlled rectangular survey for the demarcation of land.
We have found that a simple framework that outlines the costs and benefits of
implementing the demarcation systems can explain the different institutions that are
observed. Once in place, these institutions persist, indicating a strong institutional path
dependence that can influence transaction costs, the extent of land markets, and the nature
of resource use. The agricultural land institutions that we have examined in the U.S.,
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand that were put into place between the 17th and 19th
centuries, remain in force today. In this regard, institutions of land are durable, much as are
other institutions, such as language and law.

32

The list is far too large to do justice to the literatures. Besides those noted earlier, one would certainly
include the work of Barzel (1982); Demsetz (1988, 1997); Williamson (1975, 1985), and others on the theory
of the firm.

Appendix: Variables and Data Sources
Observations: Observations are centered at the initial point of British settlement and
include all land area within a 50 mile radius. For the US Public Land Survey we use the
'Point of Beginning' located in present day East Liverpool, Ohio at the coordinates
40°38′32.61″N 80°31′9.76″W. For the Dominion Land Survey of Canada we use the center
of Winnipeg as the initial point. Coordinates for initial settlements were obtained from
http://facstaff.unca.edu/mcmcclur/GoogleMaps/Projections/GoogleCoords.html.
Terrain Ruggedness: Measures average surface slope for the region (see Libecap Lueck
2009). The measure is derived from 90m digital elevation models (DEMs) downloaded
from http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org. The DEMs are generated from NASA's Shuttle Radar
Topography Mission (SRTM) and further processed by the International Centre for
Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) to fill voids in the dataset. We exclude water bodies in our
measure of terrain ruggedness. This was done by removing areas in the DEM which
overlap data from the SRTM Water Body Database (SWBD). SWBD data was obtained
online from http://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SWBD.
Soil Quality: Based on a seven-point score measuring constraints on soil fertility from the
Global Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ) dataset downloaded at 30 arc second resolution
from http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/LUC/GAEZ. We reverse the order of the GAEZ
ranking to reflect quality of the soil rather than constraints. A score of 1 indicates soil
unsuitable for agriculture. Scores 2-6 indicate soil suitable for agriculture but with
constrained productivity and severity of constraints decreasing with score. A score of 7
indicates unconstrained soil. The final measure is an average over the area of the
observation.
Year of Settlement: Initial year of settlement was obtained from
http://www.britishempire.co.uk/timeline/colonies.htm. The earliest year listed for each
colony is used for the analysis with the exception of New Zealand and Victoria, 1840 and
1851 respectively, in which we use the year they separated from New South Whales. Initial
years for the PLSS and DLS are 1785 and 1871 respectively.
Area Governed: Measured as the land area of the territory in 1,000 km2. Current
boundaries of Ontario and Quebec were used to determine area for Upper and Lower
Canada respectively. Area under the Dominion Land Survey was calculated as the
collective area of the provinces Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. Area under the U.S.
Public Land Survey System was calculated as the collective area of all U.S. states not
included in our sample with the exceptions of Hawaii, Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico,
California, Alaska, Kentucky, West Virginia, Tennessee and Vermont. Area for New
Zealand territories were adapted from the map in Kain and Baignet (1984, 319, Figure
8.30). Area for all other observations use current boundaries.
