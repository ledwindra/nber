    "abstract": "\n\nUsing pseudo-panel data, we estimate the structural\nparameters of a life--cycle consumption model with discrete labor\nsupply choice. A focus of our analysis is the abrupt drop in\nconsumption upon retirement for a typical household. The\nliterature sometimes refers to the drop, which in the U.S.\nConsumer Expenditure Survey we estimate to be approximately 16%,\nas the \"retirement--consumption puzzle.\" Although a downward\nstep in consumption at retirement contradicts predictions from\nlife--cycle models with additively separable consumption and\nleisure, or with continuous work-hour options, a consumption jump\nis consistent with a setup having nonseparable preferences over\nconsumption and leisure and requiring discrete work choices. This\npaper specifies a life--cycle model with these latter two elements, and it uses the empirical magnitude of the drop in consumption at\nretirement to provide an advantageous method of identifying\nstructural parameters --- most importantly, the intertemporal\nelasticity of substitution.\n\n",
