This paper presents a simple model of exchange rate behavior

approach to the determination of the pci nt at which the exchange

rate reaches the edge of t.he band. In the present version of the
model, it is possible to derive a surprisingly simple closed—form
analysis of the effects of' a target zone on the exchange rate. As
the paper shows, a target zone will lead to more stable exchange
rate behavior within the zone than free fi oati rig. The extent of

stabilization can be related in

issues it that it allows us to focus solely on the impact of the
target zone on exchange rate dynamics; as we will see, we can
derive some surprisingly clear and powerful conclusions about this
impact.

This says that the deviation of the exchange rat.e from the

inequality: since the expected chartge in x is zero, the expected
change in the exchange rate, which is a functi on of x, is positive
where this functi on is convex, negati ye where this furict i on is

concave. In the lower part. of the target zone, where g(x) is

THE STAB I LI ZI NG EFFECT OF THE TARGET ZONE

For the gCx) drawn in Fiqure 1, it is apparent that the
target zone has a stabilizing effect on the exchange rate within
the band. The S—curve is always flatter than the 45—degree line,

implying that fluctuations in the fundamental x are less than
fully reflected in the exchange rate; this is in contrast. to free
floating, in which the exchange rate would simply

move

up ard down

the 45--degree line. Interestingly, this stabilization takes place
even when the authorities are not actively defendi rig the band:
they only have to act. when the fundamentals reach the levels x or
x. The reason is of course the expectation that they' will defend

the zone in future if necessary. Because of this, when the
exchange rate is near the top of the band, it essentially has more
room to go down than up, and conversely at the bottom; the market

3 a concave gCx is just

tangent to s. Which of these is the correct picture?

Recall two points. First, I or x > x, the level at which
intervention by the authorities becomes necessary, we have s = s.

Thus in each case the actual exchange rate path is indicated by
the heavy line, and the continuation of gCx) is indicated by the

broken line. Secondly, intervention takes place only when s >

In each of the case indicated in Figure 2. we denote by E the

the

first point at which

authorities intervene. What we can show

is that in cases 1 and 2, s at point E is less than s. That is,
if the perceived fundamentals—exchange rate realtionship were as

illustrated, the exchange rate at E would be dragged back inside
the band, contradicting the assumption that intervention becomes
necessary

equilibrium is possible.
Consider what happens in cases 1 and 2. If s were to remain

equal to gCx), then s at x would equal gCx); that is the
definition of gCx). However in both cases 1 and 2, if x rises
above x, s is constrained to lie below gCx); while if x lies below
x,

s is still on

unambiguously smaller than on gçx). This implies that s <

An alternative way of thinking about this result, which

that in cases 1 and 2 the actual relationship between x and s is
less convex than g(x). implying an s below g(x); only in case 3 is

CONCLUSI ONS

This paper has set out a highly simplified model of exchange
rate behavior under a target zone regime. The method of solution

is one that is still somewhat unfamiliar in international
economics, and the geometry
in which the convexity of the
relationship between fundamentals and prices plays a crucial role
is new and somewhat surprising,
The malt-i substantive result is that the expectation that the
authorities will defend a target zone will exert a stabilizing
——

influence on exchanqe rate behavior inside the zone. The extent of

this stabilizing influence depends on the sensitivity of the

current exchange rate to

exchange

rate expectations,

the

volatility of the underlying determinants of the exchange rate,
and the credibility of the authorities' commitment.

The obvious next step in this research is to make the model
more realistic and interesting; this will involve both allowing a
more complex process generating fundamentals, and introducing some
"intrinsic" dynamics

arising

from such

adj ustment.
