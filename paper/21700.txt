Momentum in Imperial Russia

NBER Working Paper No. 21700

JEL No. G10,G12,G14,G23,N2
ABSTRACT
Some of the leading theories of momentum have different empirical predictions about its profitability
conditional on market composition and structure. The overconfidence explanation provided by Daniel,
Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998), for example, predicts lower momentum profits in markets
with more sophisticated investors. The information-based theory of Hong and Stein (1999) predicts
lower momentum profits in markets with lower informational frictions. The institutional theory of
Vayanos and Woolley (2013) predicts lower momentum profits in markets with less agency. In this
paper, we use a dataset from a major 19th century equity market to test these predictions. Over this
period, there was no evidence of delegated management in Imperial Russia. A regulatory change in
1893 made speculating on the St. Petersburg stock market more accessible to small investors. We
find a momentum effect that is similar in magnitude to those in modern markets and stronger during
the post-1893 period than during the pre-1893 period, consistent with the overconfidence theory of
momentum.

Introduction

Momentum strategies, also known as relative strength strategies, are a class of long-short
trading strategies that buy past winners and sell past losers. Jegadeesh and Titman (1993)
first document the profitability of momentum strategies in a sample of U.S. stocks during
the period of 1965 to 1989. Many other studies extend this initial finding by documenting
momentum profitability in the post-1989 period, in equity markets outside of the U.S., and
in other asset classes.1 While there is an abundance of empirical evidence for momentum,
the debate on its underlying mechanism remains unsettled. For instance, Daniel, Hirshleifer,
and Subrahmanyam (1998) propose a model in which investor overconfidence about the
precision of private information generates the momentum effect. In contrast, in Hong and
Stein’s (1999) model, the interaction of boundedly rational agents and the slow diffusion of
information generate initial underreaction and subsequent overreaction. More recently, Lou
(2012) and Vayanos and Woolley (2013) propose explanations of momentum driven by flows
into and between institutional money managers.
Although these theories all generate the momentum effect, they have different predictions about momentum profitability conditional on market composition and structure. Tests
of these predictions require significant variation for identification. In this paper, we use a
comprehensive dataset of monthly stock returns from the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange in
the 19th and early 20th centuries to test these predictions. The St. Petersburg Stock Exchange provides an ideal setting for investigating momentum because: 1) it is, as yet, an
untouched sample for finance researchers;2 2) there was no evidence of a delegated manage1

See, e.g., Rouwenhorst (1998), Jegadeesh and Titman (2001), and Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen
(2013).

The majority of academic studies of the momentum effect use the database of U.S. stocks maintained by
the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). The CRSP dataset starts in 1926. Even with the many

ment structure in the Russian Empire over this period;3 and 3) a regulatory change in 1893
substantially reduced the costs of speculative trading for less sophisticated investors. The
institutional theory predicts a muted momentum effect in such a market, as the institutions
that the theory relies on to generate momentum were absent. The overconfidence theory
predicts lower momentum profits during the pre-1893 period than during the post-1893 period because, in the later period, there was more market participation by those who were
more susceptible to being overconfident. In contrast, the information diffusion theory predicts higher momentum profits during the pre-1893 period because market participation was
narrower and information flow was slower.
Our results are most consistent with the investor overconfidence theory. Despite the
absence of a delegated management structure in our setting, we find that past medium-term
winners outperform past medium-term losers by as much as 74 basis points per month, which
is similar in magnitude to momentum profits in modern markets. Exposure to the market
factor cannot explain this outperformance. In addition, we find that the momentum effect
is small and insignificant during the pre-1893 period but large and highly significant during
the post-1893 period. A structural break test with unknown break date confirms this result
and the estimated break date is just two months after the regulatory change. Furthermore,
a placebo test that uses momentum returns from the London Stock Exchange shows that
the same empirical regularity is not observed in a market that did not undergo a similar
regulatory change.
Daniel and Moskowitz (2013) document that the momentum trade occasionally experipapers that use different samples, the issue of whether these samples are truly independent remains. For
instance, Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen (2013) finds a strong common factor structure among momentum
returns from a set of diverse markets and asset classes.

ences large crashes. This suggests that, whatever the mechanism, momentum profits could
compensate for an infrequently occurring risk factor. Based on this idea, they propose a
method to manage this extreme left-tail risk.4 Interestingly, in our Russian sample, which
extends more than 40 years, we find that, while momentum returns are somewhat negatively skewed, extraordinary crashes like those that occurred in the U.S. are absent. Our
evidence, therefore, is less consistent with theories that attribute high average momentum
profits to compensation for bearing crash risk and with the idea that momentum trading is a
destabilizing force. From a practical perspective, the evidence also suggests that momentum
strategies do not necessarily require protection against left-tail risk.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the historical
background. Section 3 reviews related literature and develops the hypotheses. Section 4
presents the data and methodology. Section 5 establishes the results. Section 6 concludes
the paper.

Historical Background

The St. Petersburg Exchange was established in the early 1800s, approximately one hundred
years after the founding of the City of St. Petersburg. From 1732 to 1918, St. Petersburg
was the capital of the Russian Empire. The first stocks traded on the St. Petersburg
Stock Exchange in the early 1830s.5 As the Russian economy developed, the numbers of
corporations with shares traded on the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange grew rapidly. By 1914,

more than two hundred Russian corporations had their shares listed.6 Market participants
consisted mainly of ruling elites, company insiders, and wealthy merchants. Compared to a
modern stock market, delegated managers such as mutual funds were notably absent.7
During most of our sample period from January 1865 to July 1914, the Russian stock
market was regulated by the corporate law of 1836. The goal of the law was to encourage
corporate capitalism in the style of Western Europe while maintaining bureaucratic control
in the traditional Russian style. Its primary weapon against speculation on the stock market
was the strict ban on futures agreement. Article 29 (2167) categorically stated as follows:
Any agreement among private persons, whether on the exchange or outside it,
regarding the purchase and sale of stocks or notes not for cash, and with delivery
at a future date and at a certain price, is absolutely forbidden. Furthermore,
if such agreements are made known in court, they shall be considered null and
void, and those individuals convicted of having made such agreements shall be
punished under the law against games of chance. Brokers or notaries who dare
to conclude such agreements shall be dismissed from their posts.
In the decades that followed, shortcomings of the law of 1836 became apparent and caused
the tsarist policy markers to consider numerous reforms. However, due to the bureaucrats’
more basic impulses of inertia and fear of change, most of these plans failed. One notable
exception was the Russian law PSZ 3-9741, enacted on June 8, 1893. It removed the afore6
See Owen (1991). The St. Petersburg Stock Exchange closed down due to World War I in July 1914. It
reopened for two months in 1917 before it closed down again for 74 years after the Revolution of 1917.

According to Abramov and Akshentceva (2014), the first mutual funds did not appear in Russia until
1997. Over some of the period of our study, investment funds in London traded in Russian securities,
which raised the possibility of institutional influence via international channels. Virtually all British funds,
however, held fixed-income securities. See, e.g., Goetzmann and Ukhov (2006) for details.

mentioned restrictions that prohibited futures dealings in stocks.8 As a result of this new
law, a speculative fever swept across Imperial Russia in the fall of 1893. According to Owen
(1991), “instead of being confined [...] to the Hotel Demuth in Petersburg and, in Moscow,
the Chizhov Court and the apartment of a Georgian princess, [trading activities] enveloped
all the big hotels, as crowds of people who owned interest-bearing securities sold them to
buy dividend-paying stocks whose values were soaring.” (p. 138)
In the following sections, we examine this unique setting in detail using hand-collected
share price and dividend data to test hypotheses about the specific grounds for the momentum effect. The results shed light on how unfettered speculation by broad spectrum of the
public can rapidly and radically affect market efficiency.

Related Literature and Hypothesis Development

Momentum strategies buy past medium-term winners and sell past medium-term losers.
Motivated by the observation that mutual funds tend to buy stocks that have recently
performed well, Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) systematically investigate the profitability of
such strategies for U.S. common stocks. For each portfolio formation month t, they form
portfolios based on cumulative stock returns from month t − J to t − 1 and hold them for K
months. They examine strategies with values of J that range from 3 to 12 months and values
of K that also range from 3 to 12 months. Using data during the period of 1965 to 1989,
they find that past winners significantly outperform past losers for all horizons considered
by as much as 1.49% a month.
Unlike the findings for a number of other anomalies examined, Fama and French (1996)

PSZ 3-9741 implicitly legalized time deals on stocks and bonds by forbidding such deals on gold currency
and securities reckoned in gold, solely for the purpose of realizing a speculative profit.

find that their three-factor model cannot explain momentum profits. After controlling for
the Fama and French (1993) factors, to which it is negatively correlated, momentum yields
monthly alphas of 1.74%. This deepens the momentum puzzle. The inability of pre-existing
asset pricing models to explain momentum has led researchers to add it as an additional risk
factor (Carhart (1997)).
Momentum does not seem to be a spurious result of data mining, as its effects are also
present when other basis assets are used. Rouwenhorst (1998) documents momentum in developed markets stocks, while Rouwenhorst (1999) finds evidence of momentum in emerging
markets. Using a U.S. sample, Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999) demonstrate that industry
momentum strategies are just as profitable as individual stock momentum strategies. Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen (2013) show that momentum is also present in cross-country
equity index, currency, and bond futures, as well as in commodity futures.
There is an ongoing theoretical debate as to what causes momentum. Using a risk-based
framework, Berk, Green, and Naik (1999), Johnson (2002), and Sagi and Seasholes (2007)
contend that past winners are riskier and, thus, that momentum is due to time-varying expected returns. In contrast, a number of behavioral models based on well-documented psychological evidence also yield momentum as an implication. Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny
(1998), Hong and Stein (1999), and Grinblatt and Han (2005) propose investor underreaction
to news as an explanation of momentum, while De Long et al. (1990), Daniel, Hirshleifer,
and Subrahmanyam (1998), and Barberis and Shleifer (2003) argue that momentum could
be the result of overreaction to information by market participants.
This paper focuses on the investor overconfidence theory of Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998), the information-based theory of Hong and Stein (1999), and the institutional theory of Vayanos and Woolley (2013). The Vayanos-Woolley theory is based on

6

flows between institutional money managers. Flows are triggered by changes in fund managers’ efficiency, which investors can infer from past performance. Momentum arises if flows
exhibit inertia and because rational prices underreact to expected future flows. According
to this theory, because a delegated management structure is notably absent in our setting,
the momentum effect should be relatively weak.9
The Daniel-Hirshleifer-Subrahmanyam model assumes a representative investor who is
overconfident about the precision of his private signal. New public signals, on average, are
viewed as confirming the validity of the investor’s private signal. Thus, public information
triggers further overreaction to a preceding private signal. This continuing overreaction
causes momentum in security prices. According to this theory and the basic intuition that
small, less sophisticated investors are more likely to exhibit the overconfidence bias, the
momentum effect should be stronger during times when there is more market participation
by these investors. In our sample, the post-1893 period is such a time. The Russian law PSZ
3-9741, enacted on June 8, 1893, removed all restrictions that prohibited futures dealings
in stocks.10 A speculative fever swept across Imperial Russia in the fall of 1893 as a result
of this law. Taken together, the overconfidence theory predicts that the momentum effect
should be stronger during the post-1893 period than during the pre-1893 period.
The prediction of the Daniel-Hirshleifer-Subrahmanyam model stands in contrast to that
of the Hong-Stein model. In the Hong-Stein model, two groups of boundedly rational agents
interact when information diffuses gradually across the population. Prices underreact in the
short run so momentum trading is profitable. Because this theory argues that the momentum
9

This prediction is not unique to the institutional theory. The data snooping critique of the momentum
effect also predicts that there will be no momentum in this out-of-sample setting.

effect is caused by the slow diffusion of information, it predicts that momentum should be
weaker during the post-1893 period than during the pre-1893 period. This is because the
increased public interest in the stock market caused by PSZ 3-9741 and general technological
progress in communication should have allowed information to flow faster in the post-1893
period.
The paper closest to ours is Chui, Titman, and Wei (2003). They focus on intra-industry
momentum and on the real estate investment trust (REIT) industry in the U.S. They argue
that the REIT industry experienced a structural change in 1990 and use this identification to
test opposite predictions from the overconfidence theory and the information-based theory.
For chronological reasons, they do not comment on Vayanos and Woolley (2013). Our dataset
is independent of the CRSP dataset that is used by Chui, Titman, and Wei (2003) as well as
by most other papers in this literature. Finally, their identification of the year 1990 is based
on two different factors: 1) the financial difficulties of banks and savings and loans in the
late 1980s and early 1990s that substantially reduced the amount of debt that was available
to finance commercial real estate; and 2) the 1993 legislation that made it easier for pension
funds to hold REITs in their portfolios.
Our paper is also part of an emerging literature on documenting momentum in historical
equity markets. Chabot, Ghysels, and Jagannathan (2009) document momentum in the U.K.
market over the period of 1866 to 1907. Geczy and Samonov (2013) compile a database of
U.S. stock returns over the period of 1801 to 2012. They find that momentum is consistently
profitable over this expansive period of time. Our current analysis not only supports these
authors’ findings that momentum is ubiquitous in pre-World War I markets but also allows
a comparative analysis with respect to international correlation of momentum returns and
documentation of the strategy’s frequency of crashes over long periods.

Data and Methodology

Our dataset of end-of-month stock prices for all companies listed on the St. Petersburg
Stock Exchange over the period from January 1865 to July 1914 was hand-collected from
five different sources. From the periods of January 1865 to December 1890, January 1893 to
December 1893, and January 1897 to December 1904, end-of-month prices are from the Yearbook of the Finance Ministry. From January 1891 to November 1892, end-of-month prices
are from the Bulletin of the Finance, the Industries and Trade. For the month of December
1892, end-of-month stock prices are from the Stock Exchange Newsletter. For the periods
of January 1894 to December 1896, January 1905 to December 1911, and January 1914 to
July 1914, end-of-month stock prices are from the Commercial and Industrial Newspaper.
Finally, from January 1912 to December 1913, end-of-month stock prices are directly from
the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange. The data are available for download on the website of
the International Center for Finance at the Yale School of Management.
The methodology that we used to process the raw data closely follows Goetzmann, Ibbotson, and Peng (2001). The month-end prices were obtained by searching the end-ofmonth issues for the last transaction price for each stock that month. When no transaction
took place in the last week, the latest bid and ask prices were averaged. In total, we collected 43,736 end-of-month stock prices for 598 companies. From these, we calculated 38,090
monthly returns for 543 firms. There were three instances of 50% price drops, and we assume
that they represent stock splits.11 We computed only the returns when two adjacent prices
were available, in a manner similar to that of CRSP. The number of firms in the universe
averaged 64. It reached a high point in April 1912, with 206 listed firms.12 The fact that
11

Assuming otherwise does not change our results.

In Goetzmann, Ibbotson, and Peng’s (2001) old NYSE dataset, the number of firms peaked at 114 in

9

the number of firms concurrently listed peaked at under 210, while the total number of firms
in the database exceeded 540 indicates that, not only did firms appear during the sample
period, but that they also disappeared.
We were able to obtain dividend data for the period of 1885 to 1915 from the same
sources. In total, we have 4,951 annual dividend payment observations for 478 companies.
Because we do not know whether these publications always reported dividends for all stocks
listed on the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange, we do not know whether exclusions of dividends
meant that they were not paid or whether we failed to find them. The number of stocks
for which we have an unbroken series of annual dividend payment observations is small. In
analysis that follows, we assume that the dividends were paid at year-end, but changing this
assumption does not change our results.
We control for market risk exposure in our asset pricing tests. Because we are limited by
the fact that we lack data on shares outstanding, we use a simple procedure to construct a
price-weighted market index. For each month in our sample, we calculate monthly returns
for all stocks that trade in two consecutive months. We weight these returns by the price at
the beginning of the two months. The return of the price-weighted index over period t, rM,t ,
is defined as

Results

Figure 1 shows the cumulative return of the price-weighted St.

Petersburg Stock Ex-

change (SPSE) index shown on a log scale. Table 1 shows summary statistics for the underlying monthly return of the index for the entire period of February 1865 to July 1914 and
for each decade of the period. For comparison, we also calculate summary statistics for the
NYSE index constructed by Goetzmann, Ibbotson, and Peng (2001) over the same sample
period.
Over the entire period, the annual geometric return of the SPSE index is 5.78%, but
there are periods of higher and lower growth. The annual geometric return is 9.7% in the
second half of the 1860s and 1.85% in the 1900s. The long-term mean is slightly below
the 5.82% annual growth experienced by the NYSE index over the same period. This longterm mean, however, is not a good estimate of the equity premium provided by the St.
Petersburg stock market because we know that, ex post, buy-and-hold investors lost 100%
of their investments after the Revolution of 1917. Finally, we observe that the volatility of
the index varies considerably. It is 11.03% over the entire sample period, with a high of
17.06% in the 1860s and a low of 6.98% in the 1880s.

5.1

Momentum Profits

We investigate the profitability of momentum strategies in this no-delegated-management
setting. The prediction based on Vayanos and Woolley’s (2013) institutional theory is that

11

the momentum effect should be relatively weak in the St. Petersburg stock market. Stated
differently, we ask whether the existence of a delegated management structure is a necessary
condition for price continuation patterns. This investigation is also of interest from the point
of view that previously uncovered momentum profits could be a result of data snooping.
We follow Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) in forming the momentum strategies. The
portfolios are formed based on J-month lagged returns and held for K months. The stocks
are ranked in ascending order on the basis of the lagged returns. An equally weighted
portfolio of stocks in the lowest past return tercile is the sell portfolio, and an equally
weighted portfolio of the stocks in the highest return tercile is the buy portfolio. Table 2
presents the average monthly returns of these portfolios for J and K that vary from a quarter
to a year. To ensure that our results are robust to the effect of non-synchronous trading and
the bid-ask bounce, which can be more important in our setting than in modern markets,
we also produce results for which we skip the most recent month in the portfolio formation
period.
Interestingly, in our Russian sample, momentum strategies are consistently profitable
across different values of J and K, with the exception of the case where (J, K) = (3, 3).
Similar to the results originally provided by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), the most successful zero-cost strategy selects stocks based on their returns over the previous 12 months
and then holds the portfolio for 3 months. As shown in Panel A, this strategy yields 68 basis
points per month when there is not a lag between the portfolio formation period and the
holding period. As shown in Panel B, momentum yields 77 basis points per month when
there is a one-month lag between the formation period and the holding period. In general,
the returns are higher when there is a lag between the formation period and the holding
period (Panel B) than when the formation period and the holding period are contiguous

12

(Panel A).
The natural question to ask next is whether exposure to the market factor can explain
the observed momentum profits.13 We use the price-weighted SPSE index to proxy for the
market portfolio. Table 3 presents results from two ways of adjusting for market risk: 1)
using the simple market model; and 2) using the market model where betas are allowed to
vary with market conditions14 .
Similar to the results presented in Table 2, the risk-adjusted excess returns are both
economically meaningful and statistically significant, with the exception of the case where
(J, K) = (3, 3). The raw profits are generally higher than the excess returns adjusted by the
simple market model, which, in turn, are generally higher than the excess returns adjusted by
the market model where betas are allowed to vary. Overall, excess returns of the momentum
strategies cannot be accounted for by adjustments for market risk.
Following the momentum literature, we focus the rest of the paper on the momentum
strategy where (J, K) = (6, 6) and the most recent month in the portfolio formation period is
skipped. The results for this strategy are representative of the results for the other strategies
and are available upon request. Figure 2 provides a plot of the cumulative returns of the
buy portfolio and the sell portfolio of this strategy together with the cumulative return of
the price-weighted SPSE index.
13

We do not have the data to construct the small-minus-big (SMB) and high-minus-low (HML) factors of
Fama and French’s (1993) three factor model.
14
Rouwenhorst (1998) is one of the first papers to point out momentum strategies’ time-varying factor
exposures and to use such an adjustment methodology. See also Grundy and Martin (2001).

5.2

The Effects of a Regulatory Change

As noted, the government of Imperial Russia enacted the law PSZ 3-9741 on June 8, 1893,
which removed all restrictions that prohibited futures dealings in stocks. We presume that
those restrictions were more binding for small and less sophisticated investors. As a result,
after the enactment of the law, market participation by those who were more likely to be
overconfident increased. If the momentum effect is caused by investor overconfidence as in
Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998), then momentum profits should be higher
during the post-1893 period than during the pre-1893 period. In contrast, the informationbased theory of momentum proposed by Hong and Stein (1999) would predict that the
momentum effect should be stronger in the earlier period, when market participation was
narrower and information flow was slower.
To confirm the argument that market participation by less sophisticated investors increased after the enactment of PSZ 3-9741, we begin our analysis by looking at changes in
aggregate liquidity. Specifically, less sophisticated investors tend to engage in noise trading.
In Glosten and Milgrom’s (1985) model, a risk-neutral market maker sets a bid-ask spread
that allows expected noise-trading profits to offset expected informed-trading losses. When
they believe that they face a pool of more informed traders, they react by increasing the
bid-ask spread.15 Consistent with this prediction, both Lee, Mucklow, and Ready (1993) and
Greene and Smart (1999) find a positive link between noise trading and liquidity. Because
we lack detailed transaction data, we use a liquidity measure that relies on the incidence of
observed zero monthly returns.16
15

Glosten and Milgrom (1985) assume a setting with asymmetric information. If, in contrast, there is no
asymmetric information, as in Demsetz (1968), a smaller pool of traders is sufficient to cause the bid-ask
spread to increase.
16

See Lesmond, Ogden, and Trzcinka (1999) for the theoretical treatment and Bekaert, Harvey, and

14

Specifically, we measure illiquidity using the price-weighted proportion of zero monthly
stock returns. Table 4 provides the results from our analysis on the liquidity effects of PSZ
3-9741. It shows averages for the full sample and the periods before and after June 1893, as
well as differences in means between the two subsamples.
Over the full sample, the average incidence of zero returns is 14% for all stocks.17 We also
divide each cross-section using stock price, which we use throughout this paper as a proxy
for size, to investigate cross-sectional heterogeneity. Consistent with the idea that liquidity
increases with size, the average incidence of zero returns is 17% for low-price stocks and 13%
for high-price stocks. More important, we see from the fourth row that liquidity improved
substantially and significantly after the enactment of PSZ 3-9741, and that the improvement
is larger among small stocks, which small investors tend to favor. The last row shows that
this liquidity effect is not simply due to a trend in the underlying data. The evidence thus
supports the argument that average investor sophistication decreased after PSZ 3-9741.
Next, we compare momentum profits before and after PSZ 3-9741 to differentiate between
the overconfidence theory and the information diffusion theory. Panel A of Table 5 shows
the first set of results. In the first row, we see that the winners minus losers momentum
strategy generates small and statistically insignificant profits of 5 basis points per month
during the period of February 1865 to May 1893. In contrast, the same momentum strategy
delivers large and highly significant profits of 82 basis points per month during the period of
June 1893 to July 1914. The difference in average momentum profits between the pre-1893
period and the post-1893 period is 77 basis points per month and is significant at the 1%
level. It is also interesting to note that the difference is contributed by both higher returns

from the winners portfolio (89 basis points vs. 63 basis points) and lower returns from the
loser portfolio (7 basis points vs. 53 basis points) in the later period. Similar to the liquidity
effect, a trend in the momentum return cannot explain this finding.
We formally test for a structural break with unknown break date in the average return
of the momentum portfolio by applying the Quandt (1960) and Andrews (1993) methodology. The null hypothesis of the Quandt-Andrews test is constancy of the mean against the
alternative of a significant break of unknown timing. The methodology involves calculating
a Chow (1960) F -statistic for all possible break dates in the interior π0 % to (1 − π0 )% of the
sample.18 The supF -statistic is the maximum of these F -statistics and it does not follow the
F -distribution. We use the critical values provided by Andrews (1993) and Andrews (2003).
Figure 3 plots these Chow (1960) F -statistics. The maximum F -statistic is obtained on
August 1893, just two months after the passage of PSZ 3-9741. Its value, the supF -statistic,
is 11.849 with a p-value of 0.011. The evidence, therefore, is consistent with the view that a
structural break in the momentum effect occurred around the time PSZ 3-9741 was enacted.
Panel B of Table 5 shows the results of a placebo test that we conducted using momentum
returns from Britain during the period of August 1866 to December 1892.19 Britain did not
undergo a similar regulatory regime change as Russia did in 1893; thus, we should not detect
a significant difference in average momentum returns between the pre-1893 period and the
post-1893 period in Britain. We see that this is indeed the case - the difference is 2 basis
points and not statistically significant. Taken together, our results are more consistent with
the overconfidence explanation of momentum.

Investigating Momentum Crashes

Daniel and Moskowitz (2013) document that, in the U.S. equity market over the period of
January 1927 to March 2013, the momentum trade on many occasions experiences large
crashes. These crashes are driven by the infrequent yet large-scale reversals of past losers.
Specifically, Table 2 of their paper shows that the 15 worst monthly momentum returns range
from -24.04% in January 1974 to -74.36% in August 1932. This raises the possibility that peso
problems could explain momentum, i.e., high average momentum profits are compensation
for bearing momentum crash risk (Rietz (1988); Burnside et al. (2010)). We investigate
such peso events in our sample. For a deeper understanding of momentum and for risk
management, it is also important to know more about the frequency as well as the magnitude
of the crashes.
Table 6 presents higher-order statistics of the momentum strategies. Panels A and B
present skewness and excess kurtosis, respectively. They indicate that the momentum returns
are, in general, negatively skewed and leptokurtic. The skewness coefficients average -0.39
and are an order of magnitude smaller than the skewness coefficient of -4.7 reported by
Daniel and Moskowitz (2013) for momentum in the U.S. stock market. The values of excess
kurtosis range from 2.22 to 4.95.
We target extreme outcomes of the return distributions. Panel C shows the minimum,
or most negative, momentum return observations, and Panel D shows the maximum return
observations. The panels indicate that the minimum returns are similar in magnitude to
the maximum returns. More important, there is no evidence of momentum crashes similar
to those documented by Daniel and Moskowitz (2013) for the modern U.S. stock market.
The minimum ranges from -8% to -16%, while the maximum ranges from 8% to 15%. These
results stand in stark contrast to those of Daniel and Moskowitz (2013) and suggest that
17

crashes may not be an inherent feature of the momentum trade. We leave it for future
researchers to investigate whether momentum crashes are caused by modern institutional
features, such as delegated management.

5.4

Characteristics of Momentum Strategies

The literature on momentum investing also has documented that momentum profits reverse
in the long run. For example, Jegadeesh and Titman (2001) document that, while momentum
portfolios yield significantly positive returns during the first 12 months following the portfolio
formation period, their cumulative returns in months 12 to 60 are negative.20 They argue
that this evidence is consistent with behavioral theories of momentum and reversal, but
inconsistent with the risk-based theory proposed by Conrad and Kaul (1998).
We run a similar experiment whereby we look at the performance of the momentum
strategy in event time. Specifically, we investigate the average return on buying past winners
and selling past losers in the hth month after the strategy is put into place. Table 7 presents
the results for the first 36 months after portfolio formation.21 The average momentum
returns are uniformly positive in the first 12 months after portfolio formation, after which
they turn negative. In untabulated results, we find some indication of time variation in the
risk exposure of the event time portfolios, but it is not sufficient to explain the profits. Even
though the profits turn negative in the second year after portfolio formation, they are not
always statistically significant. These results are strikingly similar to those of Jegadeesh and
Titman (1993), Rouwenhorst (1998), and Jegadeesh and Titman (2001).

18

formation. It reveals a substantial reversal of profits in the second and third years. Cumulative momentum profits increase monotonically until they reach about 6% at the end of
month 12. Then, over the next 24 months, as much as half of those profits are reversed.
Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) measure momentum profits on size-based subsamples to
examine whether the profitability of the strategy is confined to any particular subsample
of stocks. Later researchers generally find that momentum profits decrease with firm size,
consistent with predictions from behavioral theories. The idea is that information tends to
be more uncertain and diffuse more slowly for small stocks (Hong, Lim, and Stein (2000);
Zhang (2006)). Again, we use price to proxy for size and present average returns of the
momentum portfolios for two price-based subsamples in Table 8. We find that momentum
profits in the high-price subsample are all lower and less statistically significant than in the
low-price subsample. For the strategy where (J, K) = (12, 3), the average return is 1% with
a t-statistic of 5.51 in the low-price subsample and 0.41% with a t-statistic of 2.86 in the
high-price subsample.
Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) find that the momentum strategy incurs significant losses
in January but achieves positive abnormal returns in each of the other months. Grinblatt
and Moskowitz (2004) study this seasonality carefully and attribute it to tax-loss selling.
Because the Russian government did not tax capital gains, we can perform a placebo test for
their hypothesis using our sample. Table 9 provides the average returns of the momentum
strategy in each month of the year. Consistent with the tax-loss selling hypothesis, we do
not find a significant seasonal effect for momentum in Russia.22 For example, the momentum
strategy has statistically insignificant losses in January. In addition, the F -statistics show
22

Chabot, Ghysels, and Jagannathan (2009) also do not find a seasonal effect in momentum profits using
a sample of British stocks from the Victorian era, during which capital gains also were not taxed.

19

that differences in momentum returns across the months are not statistically significant.
Finally, we present a robustness check in Table 10 to ensure that our results are not due
to our treatment of missing data. Firms could drop out of the universe due to bankruptcy,
and the worst-case scenario is that equity investors get nothing. We ask whether assuming
a -100% return for exit firms would materially change our results. Our prior is that this
assumption grossly understates the actual returns and introduces additional noise into the
estimation process, which the data largely bear out. The average returns of the buy-minussell momentum portfolios are roughly the same under the alternative treatment of exit firms.
The t-statistics, however, are generally lower but still significant at conventional levels.

Conclusion

In this paper, we demonstrate momentum profitability in a novel, untouched sample. The
setting of our experiment - 19th century St. Petersburg Stock Exchange - has the unique
features of the absence of a delegated management structure and the occurrence of an exogenous shock to market composition. We try to distinguish between three theories of
momentum that have received much attention in the academic literature: the overconfidence
theory of Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998), the information-based theory of
Hong and Stein (1999), and the institutional theory of Vayanos and Woolley (2013). Our
evidence is most supportive of the behavioral theory that momentum is caused by investor
overconfidence.
