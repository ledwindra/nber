The Effects of Government Regulation on Teenage Smoking

ABSTRACT

We examine the impact of three sets of government regulations on

the demand for cigarettes by teenagers in the United States. These are:
(1) the excise tax on cigarettes, (2) the Fairness Doctrine of the Federal
Communications Commission, which resulted in the airing of anti—smoking
messages on radio and television from July 1, 1967 to January 1, 1971,
and (3) the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1970, which banned pro—
smoking cigarette advertising on radio and television after January 1, 1971.
Teenage price elasticities of demand for cigarettes are substantial

and much larger than the corresponding adult price elasticities. The
teenage smoking participation elasticity equals —1.2, and the quantity

smoked elasticity equals —1.4. It follows that, if future reductions
in youth smoking are desired, an increase in the Federal excise tax is
a potent policy to accomplish this goal.

The contention of the proponents of the advertising ban that the

Fairness Doctrine failed in the case of teenagers is incorrect. According
to our results, the doctrine had a substantial negative impact on teenage

smoking participation rates. Extrapolations suggest that the advertising
ban was no better or worse a policy than the Fairness Doctrine.

THE EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENT REGULATION ON TEENAGE SMOKING

Eugene H. Lewit, Douglas Coate, and Michael Grossman*

Since the issuance of the first Surgeon General's

Report on Smoking and

Health in 1964,1 the Federal government has been involved in a sporadic cam—

paign to discourage cigarette smoking. This campaign has consisted

primarily

of policies designed to increase public knowledge of the harmful effects of
cigarette smoking and to restrict advertising by cigarette manufacturers.
The major elements of this campaign have been the Fairness Doctrine of the
Federal Communications Commission, which resulted in the airing of anti—
smoking messages on radio and television from July 1, 1967

to January 1, 1971,

and the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1970, which banned pro—smoking
cigarette advertising on radio and television after January 1, 1971.2

In 1968, the first full calendar

year of anti—smoking messages, 1,300

anti—smoking messages were aired by the three major networks. In 1970,
1,560 messages were aired with a market value of $75

million,

about one—third of the value of the pro—smoking commercials (Rimer

1972; Doran 1979). The ban on broadcast cigarette advertising in 1971, however,

greatly reduced the airing of anti—smoking messages, relegating them

to the same status as other public service advertising. This has caused a
number of observers to question the substitution of the
broadcast advertising
ban

for the active anti—smoking campaign mounted under the Fairness Doctrine

(for example, Hamilton 1972; Doran 1979; Warner 1979).

In this paper we present the first set of estimates of the impact of
the Fairness Doctrine and advertising ban policies on the demand for cigarettes by teenagers in the United States. In addition, we examine the extent

—2—
which an increase in the Federal excise tax on cigarettes would reduce
teenage smoking.3 Excise tax changes are reflected in cigarette prices
to

and comprise an additional public policy that influences cigarette demand.4
Previous evaluations of the effects of government policies to discourage
smoking have examined the impact of these policies on per capita cigarette
consumption (Hamilton 1972; Warner 1977; Doran 1979; Ippolito, Murphy, and
Sant 1979). Fluctuations in per capita cigarette
consumption reflect pri-

marily changes in adult smoking participation rates and in the average
amount of cigarettes consumed by each adult smoker.

Accordingly, these

studies shed little light on the impact of these policies on teenage smoking.
Yet, cigarette smoking is, in part, an habitual behavior that begins early in

life. Therefore, changes in teenage smoking behavior in response to government regulatory actions can have a substantial and sustained impact on aggre-

gate smoking in the long run.5 Moreover, age at onset of smoking is negatively
correlated with the amount smoked and the incidence of negative health effects
(for example, Hammond 1966; Ippolito, Murphy, and Sant 1979).

Recent trends in smoking participation rates of

point that the Fairness Doctrine went into

effect on July 1, 1967. There-

fore, smoking rates in 1968 pertain to rates in the second half of the first

year and

first

half of the second year of the doctrine.

Thus, the data in

Ippolito, Murphy, and Sant (1979) have examined the effects of the Fairness
Doctrine and the advertising ban on per capita cigarette
consumption in the

context

of time—series cigarette demand functions. Hamilton, Warner, and

Doran conclude that the Fairness Doctrine had a significant negative
effect
on per capita consumption. Hamilton and Doran also find that the
advertising
ban may actually have encouraged consumption because the airing of
anti—smoking
messages fell dramatically after 1970. On the other hand, Ippolito, Murphy,
and Sant conclude that the effects
reported in the other studies can be attributed solely to a lagged

response to the Surgeon General's Report of 1964.

Not

only do these four time—series studies present conflicting con-

clusions regarding the effects of the Fairness Doctrine and the advertising
ban but their conclusions are
somewhat suspect -because.iu all the studies
the Fairness

Doctrine is modeled as a dichotomous variable.

In addition,

Warner and Ippolito, Murphy, and Sant exclude pro—cigarette advertising in
their

empirical work. In this paper, we develop and include in our estimated

demand functions

a time series on the number of anti—smoking messages aired

on television between the last half of 1967 and first
quarter of 1970.10
We also incorporate measures of pro—cigarette advertising in our pooled
time—series cross—section demand functions.

Moreover, we focus on a group,

teenagers, who might be most susceptible to both types of mass persuasion.
We also present the first estimates of the responsiveness of smoking

by teenagers to variations in the price of cigarettes. This is possible
because of cross—sectional differences in the price of cigarettes, primarily
due to differences in state excise tax rates.

Interstate variations in

mately 50 percent higher in the high tax states than in low tax states
(Tobacco Tax Council various years).

As summarized by Lewit and Coate (1980), estimates of the price elasticity
of demand for cigarettes by adults range, from —.1 to l.5, with the best esti-

mate being approximately - .4.

We investigate the price elasticity of demand

cigarettes by teenagers, in part, because these previous estimates primarily reflect adult smoking behavior. Given the habitual nature of smoking,
adult users, who almost always will have been users for longer periods of
for

time than youths, might be much less sensitive to price than youths. In addi-

tion bandwagon or peer effects (discussed in more detail below) are believed
to be much more important in the case of youth smoking than in the case of

—7—
adult smoking. As shown by Leibenstein (1950), the presence of these
effects increases the price elasticity of demand in absolute value."

a reduction in the border area price and should cause cigarette

smoking to increase. Note that the twenty—mile distance is selected to compute the low price of cigarettes because the purchase of cigarettes within
twenty miles of residence is likely to be incidental to the purpose of travel.

Although the incentive to make purchases or to have friends or fellow employees make purchases is positively related to the difference between own price
and low price, the lack of direct data on travel costs presents no problem
if

purchases of cigarettes are incidental to the main purpose of the trip.
Although Lewit and Coate (1980) find that

the border phenomenon is an

consideration in estimating the price elasticity of demand for
adult smokers,13 there is less reason to believe that it presents a problem
important

in the case of teenagers. This is because the quantity of cigarettes smoked
by teenagers generally is very small, so that the incentive to search for
low priced cigarettes is reduced. Moreover, the amount of incidental travel
by

teenagers in the HES sample is likely to be small because most of them

are below minimum legal driving ages. In our estimated equations, however,
we enter both own price and the difference between own and low price to
minimize measurement error problems and determine empirically the importance
of border crossing by teenagers.

the plausible assump-

tion of an underlying upward trend, the omission of time biases the coefficients of the Fairness Doctrine variables toward zero.14
The main empirical regularities in youth smoking research by sociologists

and psychologists is that youths are more likely to smoke if their
parents,
siblings, and peers also smoke (for example, Matarazzo and Matarazzo 1968;
Lanese, Banks, and Keller 1972; Green 1979).

Hence, the demand curve for

smoking is subject to "bandwagon effects" to use the term coined by

Leibenstein (1950). An alternative explanation of these effects is that

youths obtain cigarettes "free of charge" or at reduced rates from their
parents, older siblings, and peers.
In the demand function specified by equation (1), the mean smoking rate

in the locality (i) is a proxy for sibling and peer smoking. We refer to
it as the "smoking environment' of a particular youth and treat its impact
in the context of a well—known model of externalities in consumption

(Leibenstej. 1950; Becker 1971). To be specific, aggregation of equation

situation is somewhat different if there is a trend in parents'

Two measures

of

—

smoking behavior are examined: whether or not the

youth is a current smoker (SMOKEP) and the number of packs of cigarettes
smoked per day (QSMOKE). Of these two measures, we believe that smoking
participation is the most important. As indicated previously, most youth—
ful smokers will remain smokers as adults, and age at onst of smoking is
negatively

correlated with the amount smoked in adulthood and the incidence

of negative health effects. Smoking participation is a dichotomous variable
that assumes the value of 1 for current smokers. The number of packs of
cigarettes

smoked per day

1.50, or 2.50. In spite

assumes 1 of 5

possible values: 0, .25, .75,

of this, the method of estimation is ordinary

least squares. Previous research with the HES sample by Edwards and
Grossman (forthcoming) revealed almost no differences

between ordinary

least squares estimates and logit estimates obtained by the method of
maximum likelihood.

Our smoking variables are obtained directly from youths. Because youths
may underreport

their cigarette use

(for

example, Evans, Hansen, and Mittlemark

our smoking measures may be inaccurate. If any such response error is

uncorrelated with the independent

rettes, coefficients

variables in the demand function for ciga-

will be unbiased, although their standard errors will

be inflated. If all youths underreport sticking by a constant factor of proportionality, slope coefficients and their standard errors are biased downwards by this factor, leaving statistical tests of significance and elasticities unaffected.

In the two models outlined above, the existence of response error

essentially presents no problems for the statistical analysis. Response
error only becomes a problem if it is systematic or correlated with some

or all of the independent variables in the demand function. To be specific,
Warner (1978) argues that underreporting has increased,over time "due to

— ii —

increases in the perceived personal threat or social stigma associated
with smoking (p. 313)." Given this argument, one would expect reported
teenage

smoking rates to have fallen continuously during the period of the

Fairness Doctrine. In fact, the trends in Table 1 and our own empirical

results presented in Section III indicate that this was riot the case.
The Tax Burden on Tabacco, published by the Tobacco Tax Council, is
the source for annual state—specific price series on cigarettes. Price is

measured in cents per pack adjusted for municipal excise and retail sales
taxes. The own price of cigarettes is deflated by a state— and time—specific
cost—of—living index to obtain the own relative price of cigarettes (PRICE).

Similarly, the difference between the own price and the low price is divided
by the cost—of—living index to obtain the relative price difference (PDIF).

The interstate price index was developed for the year 1967 by Fuchs, Michael,
and Scott (1979). Cross—sectional price indexes for years covered by the
HES other than 1967 are developed by assuming that year—to—year percentage

for each state equal the year—to—year percentage change in the
Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for the U.S. as a whole.17
changes

Family badcground characteristics included in the demand functions are
real family income (money family income divided by the cost—of—living index),

the number of persons in the household 20 years of age or less (a proxy for
the

number of children in the family), mother's schooling, father's schooling,

absence of father from the household,18 whether or not the mother works full—

time, and whether or not the mother works part—time. Youth characteristics
included in the demand functions are age, race, sex, student status, whether
the youth works for pay during the school year, the number of hours worked
per week during the sbhool year, whether or not the youth works part—tine
during school vacations, whether or not the youth works full—time during

— 16

—

school vacations, whether or not the youth receives an allowance, region
of residence, and size of place of residence.

Some of the above variables indicate the youth's command over real
resources, others are determinants of parents' smoking, and others have

shown to be important determinants of youth smoking mnstudies by
psychologists and sociologists (for example, Matarazzo and Matarazzo 1968;
been

Lanese, Banks, and Keller 1972; Green 1979). It is important to control
for region and size of place of residence because the liES is a nationally
representative sample for the period 1966—1970 but not for each year of

this period. In addition, the inclusion of size of place of residence
controls for cross—sectional differences in the cost of living that are
not reflected in the state price index. We do not present or discuss the
effects of parental and youth characteristics on youth smoking in Section

III.

But it should be realized that all estimated price and Fairness

Doctrine effects control for (hold constant) the effects of these variables!9
A number of

alternative specifications and

variables are used to esti-

mate the impacts of the Fairness Doctrine. The simplest specification is
one with a dichotomous variable that identifies youths who were interviewed

during

the period of the doctrine (FAIR). A second specification distin-

guishes among four groups of youths: those interviewed during the first year
of the Fairness Doctrine (Tl = 1), those interviewed during the second year

of the doctrine

omitted category).2°

Our

other specifications capitalize in various ways on information on

the number of hours per day that the youth reports he spends watching tele-

vision (TV). Advertising on television was the main source of exposure of
youths

to cigarette advertising prior to the banning of such advertisements

— 17

—

on January 1, 1971. Most other cigarette advertising
occurs in the adult
print media and via sample cigarettes. Youths have only limited exposure
to these sources.
Based on time—series analysis, Hamilton (1972), Schmalensee
(1972),

Doran (1979) have shown pro—cigarette advertising to have'

at best a weak

impact on per capita consumption of cigarettes in the aggregate.
These findings do not conflict with the contention of the cigarette industry
positive

that most advertising is directed toward interbrand competition and little

at stimulating total consumption per se. It is reasonable to suppose,
however, that pro—cigarette advertising may have a different and perhaps
larger effect on a youth who does not currently smoke or who has been experi—

nenting with this behavior than it does on an adult. In particular, even if
advertisements are directed toward interbrand competition, they may give
youths the impression that smoking is an "attractive adult behavior." Presumably, the anti—smoking messages aired on television during the Fairness
Doctrine, which stressed the health hazards posed by smoking, should work

against the impact of pro—cigarette advertising on teenage smoking.
To test the above notions, we estimate a multiple regression in which
two of the independent variables are the amount of time spent watching television per day (TV) and the product of this variable and the Fairness
Doctrine dummy (TVxFAIR).

According

Our final specifications of the Fairness Doctrine combine the individual
data on TV—watthing reported by each youth with aggregate time series on the
number of pro—smoking and anti—smoking

messages aired on television for the
years 1965 through 1970. To be specific, let PRO be the number of pro—
smoking messages aired on television in the twelve month& preceding the
date on which a given youth was interviewed.

Similarly, let ANTI be the

number of anti—smoking messages aired on television in the same twelve—

month period.22 Then we compute the product of PRO and TV (PROTV) and
the

product of ANTI and TV (ANTITV). These variables are proxies for the

number of pro— or anti—smoking messages that a youth saw as opposed to the

number aired. The rationale is that the ratio of messages seen to messages
aired is positively related to the amount of time spent watching television.
We estimate cigarette demand functions with PROTV and ANTITV as two of the

independent variables. Nonlinear specifications are explored in which the
square

of ANTITV (ANTITVS) and

the

product of PROTV

and the Fairness Doctrine

dummy (PRTVFAIR) are included. These are discussed in more detail when the

results

are presented.

The time series on anti—smoking messages is taken from Rimer (1972).
These are based on reports made by the three networks (NBC, ABC, and CBS)

to the producers'of the anti—smoking messages: the American Heart Association,
the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, and the U.S.

Public Health Service. Undeflated outlays on TV advertising by cigarette
companies are taken from Doran (1979).23 This series is deflated by the
median price (cost) of a 20 second spot announcement on network owned and

operated TV stations, which was obtained from Standard Rate and Data,
Incorporated.

Results

Estimated effects of the responsiveness of teenage smoking to the
price of cigarettes and to the Fairness Doctrine are discussed in this

section. Before presenting the full set of estimates, we.
appropriateness

explore the
of our specification of the border phenomenon (the purchase

of cigarettes at a price lower than the own locality price), which relies
on the use

of

the difference between the own

price

and the low price (if

it is positive) as an independent variable. Three alternative price effects
from smoking participation regressions are presented in Panel A of Table 4.
The

corresponding price effects from quantity smoked regressions are pre-

sented

in Panel B. Each regression includes all family and youth charac-

teristics mentioned in Section II but excludes variables related to the

Fairness Doctrine. Regression (1) includes the price difference (PDIF),
while regression (2) omits it. Regression (3) is estimated using a subsample
of youths in which the price difference is zero (the border price is either
equal to or larger than the own price).

In all three specifications price elasticities at the mean are substantial; in most cases they exceed 1 in absolute value.

Moreover, the elastici-

the table are the appropriate ones to use in evaluating the impacts
of an increase in the Federal excise tax on cigarettes or an increase in
ties in

price due to an increase in input prices. In these situations the own price
and the low price rise by the same amount, and the difference between them
remains the same.24
One explanation of the large price elasticities in Table 4 is that
they
may incorporate income effects as well as substitution effects. We do hold

real family income and proxies for the amount of discretionary
income that a youth can spend on his own consumption, such as whether or
constant

functions. This finding is consistent with the notions that youths are less
mobile than adults and have less incentive to search for lower priced cigarettes because youths typically smoke much less than adults.

of

cigarettes and the price difference also are given. As in Table 4,

the regressions in Tables 5 and 6 include all family and youth characteris-

tics. An inspection of the price effects in the two new tables reveals
that the conclusions reached with respect to these effects are not altered

when the Fairness Doctrine variables are added to the rejressions. In particular, the own price coefficients are negative and significant, while
the price difference coefficients are positive and not significant. In addi-

tion, elasticities at the mean always exceed one. The smoking participation
elasticity of approximately —1.20 is nearly five times larger than the implied elasticity of quantity smoked by those who smoke of —.25.
An overview of the impacts of the Fairness Doctrine in the seven alternative specifications indicates that, whatever the impacts of the doctrine
on smoking participation, it has little or no impact on the quantity smoked.
For this reason and because of the importance of smoking participation as a
behavioral variable, we focus on the results in Table 5 in the remainder
of this section.

In regression (1), the coefficient of the dichotomous variable that
identifies youths who were interviewed during the period of the Fairness

Doctrine (FAIR) is negative and significant. It indicates that during the
period of the doctrine the teenage smoking rate was 3.0 percentage points
smaller than in the 16 month period prior to the doctrine (March 1966—

June 1967). Time trends in smoking participation during the Fairness
Doctrine

period itself are explored in regression (2). As shown by the

coefficient of Tl, the smoking rate fell by 5.2 percentage points during

the first year of the doctrine. The rate rose by 3.1 percentage points in
the second year (given by the difference between the coefficient of T2 and

that of Ti) and declined by .5 percentage
to

points in the third year relative

the second (the coefficient of T3 minus that of T2).

— 27—

Clearly, the above findings suggest that the Fairness Doctrine had its

largest impact in the first year of its existence. Put differently, the
introduction

of the doctrine represented a "shock" to the underlying upward

trend in teenage smoking in the mid—l9GOs and early 1970s. But by the
9

second year of the doctrine, the trend factor began to dominate the shock.
This scenario mirrors the shocks to aggregate time trends in smoking due
to anti—smoking developments that are modeled and estimated by Ippolito,
Murphy,and Sant (1979) and by Lewit, Coate, and Grossman (in progress).
The

decline in smoking participation in the first year of the Fairness

Doctrine is dramatic evidence that smoking behavior can change drastically
when the rate of change in anti—smoking information is extremely large.

The coefficients of T2 and T3 indicate that the impact of anti—smoking
messages is subject to diminishing returns. For teenagers, the effects
of the doctrine in its second and third years are dominated by the trend.25

Our findings also are consistent with trends in teenage smoking in the
surveys conducted by the National Clearinghouse for Smoking and Health (NCSH)

that

are shown in Table 1. According to the NCSH surveys, the teenage smoking

rate rose by 3.7 percentage points between 1968 and 1970.

According to regres-

sion (2), the teenage smoking rate rose by 2.6 percentage points between the

and the third years of the Fairness Doctrine (the coefficient of T3
minus that of Ti). The two estimates differ because the NCSH survey include
first

18

year olds, because our estimate controls for variables that may have

changed between 1968 and 1970, and because the two time periods (1968 and

1970 versus the first and third years of the Fairness Doctrine) are not exactly
the same. It is important to note that the increase in teenage smoking between
1968

and 1970 or between the first and third years of the Fairness Doctrine

does not indicate that the anti—smoking messages failed to discourage smoking

—28 —
by

teenagers, as claimed by the proponents of the advertising ban (for

example, Evans 1976; Critz 1977). Based on our first regression, teenage
smoking was 3.0 percentage points smaller during the Fairness Doctrine
than it was in the 16 months prior to the doctrine. Based on the second

regression, the doctrine was associated with a 3.4 perceniage point reduc—
tion in smoking. 26

The five additional regressions in Table 5 try to identify mechanisms
via which the Fairness Doctrine reduced teenage smoking. In regression (3)
the number of hours per week spent watching television (TV) has a positive
and significant impact on the probability of smoking. On the other hand,
the interaction between TV—watching and the Fairness Doctrine dummy variable

has a negative and significant impact on this probability. Although TV—
watching

has a positive impact on the probability of smoking during the

Fairness Doctrine period (given by the sum of the coefficients of TV and
TVXFAIR), the effect is much weaker than in the pre—doctrine period. To be
specific, a one—hour per week increase in TV—watching raises the smoking
probability by 1.1 percentage points

in the pre—doctrine period. The corn—

parable increase in the during period is .3 percentage

points. The weaker

in the latter period reflects the presence of anti—smoking messages
on TV. The effect is positive rather than negative, in part, because the
effect

nunter of pro—smoking messages exceeded the number of anti—smoking messages

throughout the period of the Fairness Doctrine.
In regression (4), we model the initial shock
process by interacting TV with each of the

Doctrine

and

diminishing

effect

three years of the Fairness

(TVxT1, TVXT2, TVXT3). The coefficients of all these interactions

are negative and, for the first two periods, significant.. Moreover, an

— 29

increase

—

in TV—watching has a slight negative effect on the jrobability of

smoking in the first year of the Fairness Doctrine.
In regressions (5), (6), and (7), the proxies for the number of pro—
and anti—smoking messages seen are entered (PROTV and MTITV).27 In regression
(5) the coefficient of PROW has the anticipated positive sign,

and

the coeffi-

cient of M4TITV has the anticipated negative sign. Neither coefficient, however, is statistically significant. In the sixth regression we include the
square of ANTITV (ANTITVS) as an additional independent variable. This is
an attempt to capture elements of a model with an initial shock followed by

a diminishing effect. It is particularly important to allow the number of
anti—smoking messages aired to have a nonlinear- effect because both TV—
watching and the number of messages aired rose throughout the period of the
Fairness

Doctrine. The finding that the coefficient of ANTITV is negative

and significant, while the coefficient of ANTITVS is positive and significant
is consistent with the hypothesized diminishing effect of anti—smoking
messages.

The model is refined further in regression (7) by allowing pro—

cigarette advertising to have a different effect in the Fairness Doctrine

period than in the pre—doctrine period.28 Consistent with a priori notions,
-

the coefficient of PROTV is positive and significant, while that of the

• interaction betweenPROTV and

negative

the

Fairness Doctrine dummy (PRTVFAIR) is

and significant. The coefficients of AETITV and MJTITVS have the

appropriate signs but are not significant.
Clearly, the four measures of pro— and anti—smoking messages seen in

regression

(7) are highly correlated. One cannot expect all four variables

to achieve statistical significance. The finding that all three have the
appropriate signs in regression (6) and all four have the appropriate signs
in regression (7) is consistent with our expectations.

— 30

Panel

—

A of Table 7 summarizes the implied impacts of the Fairness

Doctrine on

teenage

regressions

in Table 5. The procedure simply is, to predict smoking parti-

smoking participation rates from each of the seven

cipation in the periods before and during the doctrine based on the regression

coefficients and on the mean values

in each period of the

Fairness

Doctrine variables.29 The computations reveal that we have specified a
plausible mechanism by which the Fairness Doctrine reduced teenage smoking.
In particular regressions (3), (4), and (7) account for between 2.1
percentage
points and 2.7 percentage points of the 3.0 to 3.4 percentage point reduction

predicted by the simple trend equations [regressions (1) and (2)]. Mote
that equation (4) does a better job of explaining the trend than those that

enter the proxy

for

anti—smoking messages seen and allow it to have a

-

diminishing effect. We believe that this is because even the nonlinear speci-

fication does

not fully capture the initial shock caused by the messages.

Panel B of Table 7 contains the predicted impact of the advertising ban
on further changes in teenage smoking from regressions (3), (4), (5), (6),

and (7). In the first two predictions, it is assumed that the effects on
TV—watching disappear after the end of the Fairness Doctrine. In the last
three predictions, it is assumed that the:number of anti—smoking messages

aired fall to zero after the end of the doctrine. Although the anti—smoking
messages did not disappear entirely after 1970, the number aired declined

by almost 80 percent relative to the number aired in 1969. Moreover, in
the post—doctrine period many of the messages were aired at times when

youths are extremely unlikely to be viewing television.30 The figures in
parentheses show how the last three estimates are altered when the number
of anti—smoking messages aired during the ban equals 20 percent of the 1969

value.31 The predicted declines in teenage smoking after the end of the

Fairness Doctrine are

modest. They suggest that the ban was not a particularly effective policy instrument to curtail teenage smoking in a post—

Fairness Doctrine environment. Of course, since small declines in smoking
rather than increases are shown in Panel B, one can argue that the adver-

tising ban was no worse a policy than the Fairness Doctrfne. In particular,
our extrapolations suggest that the ban should have discouraged teenage
smoking. This is in contrast to the findings by Hamilton (1972) and Doran
(1979) that the ban should have increased per capita cigarette consumption
in the aggregate. Our results differ from those of Hamilton and Doran in
part because we include an explicit measure of exposure to

anti—smoking

messages in our regressions. Moreover, we focus on teenagers, whose responses to pro— and anti—smoking messages are likely to differ from adults'
responses.

A full—cost—benefit analysis of the Fairness Doctrine, the advertising
ban, or an increase in the Federal excise tax on cigarettes vis—a—vis

teenage

smoking is beyond the scope of this paper. Similarly, we cannot provide a
definitive statement with regard to the relative merits of an active anti—

smoking policy versus a policy of laissez faire. But based on our results,
we can highlight a number of policy—relevant facts and insights:
(1)

Teenage price elasticities of demand for cigarettes are large.

The smoking participation elasticity equals —1.2, and the quantity smoked
elasticity equals —1.4. This result is consistent with Lewit and Coate's
(1980) finding that smoking by young adults ages 20 through 24 is much more

responsive to price than smoking by older adults. It follows that, if
future reductions in youth smoking are desired, an increase in the Federal

excise tax is a potent policy to accomplish this goal. Such a policy may
also be an effective way to curb the deterimental health effects of

smoking

— 33 —

in

the long run without substantially harming the cigarette industry in the

short run. Since youth and young adult price elasticities are much larger.
than adult price elasticities while adult smokers account for the bulk of
cigarette sales, a substantial excise tax increase would
reduce smoking participation by young new

smokers

substantially

but ledve industry sales

largely unchanged. Given the evidence that individuals are considerably
less likely to initiate smoking after age 25, it is quite possible that the
cohort of young smokers who never begin to smoke as a result of the tax in-

crease would never become regular smokers. As a consequence, over a period
of several decades, aggregate smoking and its associated detrimental health

effects would decline substantially.
(2) The contention of the proponents of the advertising ban

that

the

Fairness Doctrine failed in the case of teenagers is incorrect. According
to our results, the doctrine had a substantial negative impact on teenage

smoking participation rates. We also have evidence that the mechanism at

work

was the responsiveness of teenagers to anti—smoking messages that stress

the health hazards posed by smoking. This calls into question Evans's (1976)
argument that teenagers are not sensitive to such messages.
(3)

Between 1970 and 1974, smoking participation by teenagers rose by

0.4 percentage points (seeTable 1). Based on the computations in Panel B
of Table 7 we predict a reduction of approximately 0.6 percentage points
over this period due to the advertising ban. 32 Why did the percentage of
teenagers

who smoke rise rather than fall? The obvious answer is that our

forecast assumes no changes in the determinants of teenage smoking except

for variables related to the Fairness Doctrine. Smoking rates may have
risen because an underlying upward trend in this behavior dominated developments

related to the advertising ban. But there is a more obvious explanation.

— 34 —

Between 1970 and 1974, the relative price of cigarettes declined
by roughly
6 percent due to a rapid increase in the Consumer Price Index accompanied

by no change in the Federal excise tax rate. Our regression results suggest
that this should have caused the smoking rate to rise by 1.0 percentage
P

points. The net extrapolation, based on these two competIng

factors, is

an increase of .4 percentage points, which coincides with the observed in—
crease.

33

(4) &s shown in Table 1, the teenage smoking rate peaked in 1974; it

declined from 15.6 percent in that year to 11.7 percent in 1979. It is
still too early to explain the apparent reversal in trend or the differen-

tial trends for boys and girls.34 It is plausible to hypothesize, however,

the trend reversal represents in part a lagged response to the downward
trend in adult smoking participation rates reported in Table 2.

3Arguments for government intervention in the cigarette market are

derived

from the assumptions of externalities in consumption (the health

of some persons enters the utility function of others); externalities in
production (smoking by some may harm the health of others); lack of corn—

information about the health effects of smoking, particularly among

plete

youth; and moral hazard

in the markets for life and health insurance (pre-

miums paid by smokers do not fully reflect their higher probabilities of
illness and

death).

In this paper we do not evaluate these assumptions.

4Although the Federal excise tax on cigarettes has remained at 8 cents
per pack for the last 25 years, there have been several attempts to increase
it in recent years because of the concern over the health effects of ciga-

rette smoking. Moreover, there is evidence that some states increased their
cigarette taxes as a result of the anti—smoking publicity that followed the

issuance of the Surgeon General's Report in 1964. In 1965 there were 23
state and

local

cigarette tax

increases

compared with no more than a dozen

in any of the preceding 14 years (Kellner 1973).
5Among adults who smoke, 95 percent began to smoke between the ages of

12 and 21 (Center far Disease Control and

National

6The 1979 figures in Table 1 reveal dramatic reductions in teenage

smoking between 1974 and 1979. When the data are examined by age and sex,
smoking participation rates for boys declined by almost 25 percent for 12—16

year olds and by 38 percent for 17—18 year olds. For girls, participation
rates between 1974 and 1979 increased slightly for those 17—18 yearsr old and

declined slightly for those 12—14 years old. Smoking by girls ages 15—16
fell, however, by almost 42 percent after rising by almost 110 percent be-

tween 1968 and 1974. The extent to which these dramatic trend reversals and
inconsistencies are clue

National Surveys on

101n research in progress, we are estimating time—series cigarette demand
functions that include the number of anti—smoking messages aired on television
between the last half of 1967 and 1979.

11Note that price effects are not unrelated to the anti—smoking campaign
because price may be interpreted broadly to incorporate both the nominal

price of cigarettes and the indirect cost of consuming them. The latter
pertains to the perceived cost of the health hazards associated with smoking.
Developments such as the anti—smoking campaign presumably raise the perceived

cost. The interaction between the money price of a package of cigarettes (p)
and the perceived cost of the health risks of smoking (z) in the demand function

for cigarettes is highlighted by specifying the quantity smoked (y) as

a function of the "full" price of cigarettes (it

yg(Tr)=g(p+z).

z):

Note that an increase in the perceived cost of smoking alters the elasticity
of smoking with respect to money price, although the direction of the effect

is

ambiguous. For example, suppose that the elasticity of smoking with

respect to full price is constant. Then

14Smoking participation by adult males increased dramatically during

191n general, our findings with respect to the impacts of family and

youth characteristics are consistent with those of other studies. In particular, smoking is negatively related to mother's and father's schooling
and positively related to the number of persons in the family 20 years of

age or less. Moreover, a youth is more likely to smoke and to smoke larger
amounts if he is not a student, if he works during the school year, if he
works during school vacations, if his mother works full—time, and if his

father is absent from the household. Boys smoke more than girls; whites
smoke more than blacks; and older youths smoke more than younger youths.
These results strengthen our confidence in the validity and reliability
of the liEs smoking measures.

20The first year of the Fairness Doctrine is July 1, 1967—June 30, 1968.

The second year is July 1, 1968—June 30, 1969. The third year is July 1,
1969—March 31, 1970. Since the lIES ended in March 1970, we have no data for
the last quarter of the third year.

series for PRO and ANTI are available on an annual rather than

on April 1, 1966, PRO for that youth equals three—fourths of its 1965 value

1966 value. A similar weighting scheme is used to

ANTI. Clearly, ANTI equals zero for all youths who were interviewed

before the Fairness Doctrine went into effect.

24These are not the appropriate elasticities to use in evaluating the
effect on teenage smoking of an increase in state or local excise taxes.
In these cases, even

a small increase in the local tax rate can result in

substantial increase in the price difference if border area taxes are not
also increased. As a result, some of the deterent effects of a state or
a

local tax

increase may be mitigated. Of course, to predict the percentage

reduction in cigarette consumption caused by a 1 percent increase in any

excise tax, one has to know the share of the tax in total price as well as
the price elasticity of demand.

downward trend in teenage smoking during the Fairness Doctrine period due

to an upward trend in underreporting.

schooling rose. Note also that the reduction in teenage smoking from 1970

to 1972 (see Table 1) occurred in a petiod in which the relative price of

cigarettes rose.

have larger effects on smoking participation rates of boys than on smoking

participation rates of girls.
