The main conclusions are that much of the coalitional activity involving developing countries thus far in the round has been agenda-moving and joint proposal-making, rather than negotiating involving exchanges of concession. At the same time, however, coalitional activity by a larger group of mid-sized developed and smaller developing countries who see a major interest in preserving the multilateral system has been central to the process.\n\n",
