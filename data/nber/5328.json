I find that although the persuasiveness of interest groups, especially doctors, was an important determinant of the 1918 vote, interest groups alone could not explain the resounding defeat of state-provided health insurance.  Voters, I find, were unwilling to pass a costly measure with an unpredictable outcome.\n\n",
