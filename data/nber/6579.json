The existence of a global firm is somewhat puzzling.  Combining workers who have different cultures, legal systems, and languages imposes costs on the firm that would not be present were all workers to conform to one standard.  In order to offset the costs of cross-cultural dealing, there must be complementarities between the workers that are sufficiently important to overcome the costs.  Disjoint and relevant skills create an environment where the gains from complementarities can be significant.  It is also necessary that teammates be able to communicate with one another.  The search for the  best practice' is analyzed and empirical support from an examination of trading patterns is provided.\n\n",
