    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper uses the universe of mortgage contracts to estimate the response of high-interest lenders to borrower protection regulations aimed at simplifying and making loan terms more transparent. Using a quasi-experimental design, we find that lenders substantially reduce interest rates \u2013 by an average of 10% \u2013 in order to avoid being subject to borrower protection, without reducing amounts lent or the number of loans approved. This finding implies that a substantial number of high-interest lenders prefer to issue obfuscatory mortgage contracts with lower interest rates rather than more transparent and regulated mortgages with higher interest rates.\n\n",
