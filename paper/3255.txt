FEDERAL TAXATION AND THE SUPPLY OF STATE DEBT
ABSTRACT

This paper presents a aodel of debt finance at the sub-national level
froa which municipal bond supply equations are derived. Federal tax
considerations are shown to be important deterainants of the price entering
the bond supply equation.
Using data on 40 state governaents over a seven year period in the
1980s, I show that federal tax rates have an iaportant effect on the supply
of municipal bonds - independent of the deaand side effect that is usually
considered in the literature. Furtheraore, the effect persists after
controlling for capital expenditures, thereby suggesting that aunicipal bond
proceeds are fungible at the aargin. This has iaplications for the
measurement of the tax expenditure associated with tax exeapt debt.
