    "abstract": "\n\nDuring the seventies and eighties the US steel industry received trade protection.  However, these rents were not used to improve competitiveness.  Instead, they were reflected in higher wages and a greater share of profits invested in sectors not related to steel.  Moreover, the steel industry failed to adopt technological innovations on a timely basis and was displaced by the minimills.  We rationalize these puzzling outcomes using a dynamic game between workers and firms.\n\n",
