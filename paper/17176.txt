How Teacher Turnover Harms Student Achievement

NBER Working Paper No. 17176
June 2011
JEL No. I21
ABSTRACT
Researchers and policymakers often assume that teacher turnover harms student achievement, but
recent evidence calls into question this assumption. Using a unique identification strategy that employs
grade-level turnover and two classes of fixed-effects models, this study estimates the effects of teacher
turnover on over 600,000 New York City 4th and 5th grade student observations over 5 years. The
results indicate that students in grade-levels with higher turnover score lower in both ELA and math
and that this effect is particularly strong in schools with more low-performing and black students.
Moreover, the results suggest that there is a disruptive effect of turnover beyond changing the composition
in teacher quality.

How teacher turnover harms student achievement
Matthew Ronfeldt, Hamp Lankford, Susanna Loeb, and Jim Wyckoff

INTRODUCTION
Teacher turnover rates are high, particularly in schools serving low-income, non-white and
low-achieving student populations. Nationally, about 30 percent of new teachers leave the
profession after five years, and the turnover rate is 50 percent higher in high-poverty schools as
compared to more affluent ones (Ingersoll, 2001). Teacher turnover rates also tend to be higher in
urban and lower-performing schools (Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin, 1999). As an example, in New
York City approximately 18 percent of teachers leave their school each year.
Researchers and policy makers often assume that teacher turnover harms student learning.
There are many reasons to think it would, as institutional memory is lost and resources are spent on
the hiring process. Yet, there exists little empirical evidence for a direct effect of teacher turnover
on student achievement (Guin, 2004). Moreover, the organizational management literature has
demonstrated that some amount of turnover may in fact be beneficial to institutions and individuals.
Institutional turnover can, for example, result in better person-job matches and infusion of new
ideas into organizations (Abelson & Baysinger, 1984). These benefits of turnover can be enhanced
if it is the less effective employees who leave.
A growing body of evidence indicates that teachers who produce higher student
achievement gains are at least as likely, and sometimes more likely, to stay in schools than their less
effective peers (Boyd et al, 2010; Goldhaber, D., Gross, B., and Player, D., 2007; Hanushek &
Rivkin, 2010). For example, Boyd et al. (2010) studied data on teachers’ applications for transfer to
uncover which teachers are more likely to want to transfer from NYC schools. They discovered that
teachers who produced higher achievement gains and those with more experience were less likely to

1

apply for transfer.1 This reduced interest in moving held true even for teachers in the lowestperforming schools. Similarly, Hanushek and Rivkin (2010) found that, in Texas, those who left a
given school tended to be less effective than those who stayed. Contrary to common assumptions,
the relative effectiveness of stayers as compared to leavers was actually highest in schools with more
low-achieving and black students. Because neither Boyd et al. (2010) nor Hanushek and Rivkin
(2010) directly tested whether the teachers who filled vacancies in a given school were more
effective on average than those they replaced, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the overall
impact of turnover. However, Hanushek and Rivkin did simulate the impact were only “rookie”
teachers to replace exiting ones, and found no overall effect of turnover on student achievement.
The results of the Hanushek and Rivkin (2010) simulation are an important challenge to the
commonly held assumption that teacher turnover harms student achievement, especially that of lowperforming, poor, and minority students. However, their findings have important limitations, even
aside from being simulated, rather than observed, effects of new hires. Namely, the results assume
that the only lever by which teacher turnover harms or helps student achievement is by adjusting the
average effectiveness of individual teachers on the school’s faculty. Students are thought to benefit
when they get teachers who are more effective than the ones that left the school. But turnover may
impact student achievement beyond the relative effectiveness of those who stay as compared to
those who leave.
When teachers leave schools, for example, previously held relationships and collaborations
are lost, and new ones form. Bryk & Schneider (2002) argue that the quality of relationships (trust)
between teachers, and between teachers and students, is related to student achievement. To the
degree that turnover disrupts the formation or maintenance of these relationships, it may also harm

On the other hand, they found that teachers with better pre-service qualifications (LAST scores, competitiveness of
undergraduate institution) were more likely to apply for transfer.

student achievement. On the other hand, turnover may result in the infusion of new ideas into the
organization which might help raise student achievement.
Although it is important to consider and study the separate mechanisms by which turnover
may impact student achievement – relational trust, infusion of new ideas, changes in average teacher
effectiveness - we still know very little about the overall effect of attrition on students. Guin (2004)
studied 66 elementary schools in a large urban district to look at relationships between school-level
turnover and the proportion of students meeting standards on statewide assessments in reading and
math. Pearson correlations were significant and negative, demonstrating that schools with higher
turnover also had lower achievement. However, the findings are clearly not causal as low
achievement may cause teachers to leave, teachers leaving may cause low achievement, or a third
factor (e.g. poverty, crime, or poor school leadership) may simultaneously cause both low
achievement and higher turnover.
Using a unique identification strategy, and two classes of fixed-effects regression models, this
study presents the cleanest estimates to date of a direct effect of teacher turnover on student
achievement. Three research questions guide the investigation: What is the average effect of teacher
turnover on student achievement? Are the effects different for different kinds of schools? What
explains the relationship between teacher turnover and student achievement? The paper proceeds as
follows. We first describe the data and methodological approach. We then present the results and
conclude with a discussion of the implications of the findings.

DATA
This study draws on extensive administrative data from the New York City Department of
Education and the New York State Education Department. Analyses focus on approximately
625,000 observations of 4th and 5th grade students across all New York City elementary schools over

3

five academic years (2000-2002; 2004-2007).2 We were able to link student test scores in math and
ELA to student, class, school, and teacher characteristics.
Table 1 describes student, teacher, and school-by-grade characteristics. About 70 percent of
students in 4th and 5th grades in NYC were either black or Hispanic. Over one-third of students had
a home language other than English, and 61 percent were on free or reduced priced lunch. The 4th
and 5th grade teachers in the district had, on average, six years of experience. Approximately 2
percent of students had been suspended in the previous year, while 9 percent had switched schools
since the prior year. Finally, students were absent for an average of approximately 11 days in the
previous year.
On average, 82 percent of teachers each year had stayed in the same school from the prior
year (stayers). Approximately four percent of 4th and 5th grade teachers had transferred schools
(movers), while 12 percent were first year teachers. Each 4th and 5th grade within each NYC school
had, on average, six teachers, with a range from one to as many as 22 teachers. Figure A plots the
distribution of teachers per grade in the sample schools.
Our identification strategy requires measuring school-by-grade level turnover in each year.
Such measurement is not entirely straightforward. To illustrate, imagine a 4th grade within School A
that had six teachers in year 0. Due to increasing enrollments, in year 1 there were seven 4th grade
teachers. Of these, five were stayers, one a mover, and one a first year teacher. Teacher turnover
could be estimated as the proportion of year 0 teachers that were no longer in the 4th grade in School
A in year 1 (1/6=16.7 percent). On the other hand, turnover could be measured as the proportion
of teachers that were new to the school-by-grade in year 1 -- either first year teachers or movers
(2/7=28.6 percent). The first measure -- “lagged attrition” -- defines turnover as the proportion of

2 Due to peculiarities in the NYC administrative data collected in 2002-2003, we were unable to identify the grade levels
of all teachers in NYC. Since our analyses depend upon grade-level information across the district, we focused our study
on the years we had data prior to and following the 2002-2003 academic year.

teachers in a given grade level in year t-1 who left the school by year t. The second measure -“proportion new” -- defines turnover as the proportion of teachers in a given grade level who are
new (movers or first year teachers) to the school in year t. We used both measures in all analyses to
test whether results were robust across them; the distributions for lagged attrition can be seen in
Figure B and for proportion new in Figure C. The measures have similarly shaped distributions, bell
shaped with a right skew.
The average teacher turnover rate in each grade in each school in each year was similar for
both of the measures we developed: 0.20 for the lagged attrition measure and 0.21 for the
proportion new measure. Thus, each year, approximately one out of every five 4th and 5th grade
teachers in NYC left or came to a given grade level in a given school. Lagged attrition could result
from teachers leaving the profession altogether or transferring to another school. This measure does
not include the transfer of teachers from one grade to another within the same school. We chose
not to include this behavior because, in such cases, the expertise of teachers would remain within the
same school.3 More than one-third of school-by-grades experienced no teacher turnover each year
(between 36 percent and 37 percent). On the other hand, between two and three percent of 4th and
5th grade level teams had turnover rates of 100 percent each year.4

METHODS
As described above, our analyses are driven by three questions: What is the average effect of
teacher turnover on student achievement? Are the effects different for different kinds of schools?
And what explains the relationship between teacher turnover and student achievement?

3 We also ran models that included indicators for whether teachers switched grade levels. Results were similar suggesting
the grade-level switching does not account for the effects of grade-level turnover on student achievement.
4 We use many classroom and school-level characteristics as controls in the regression models described below.
Appendix Table 1 describes these variables used as school and classroom controls in analyses.

What is the average effect of teacher turnover on student achievement? Typically teacher
turnover is measured at the school level. However, high turnover rates in the 6th grade may have
little impact on incoming 4th grade students, especially when the 4th grade level team stays intact. To
get a more precise estimate of the effects of turnover, this study examines turnover at the school-bygrade-by-year level, rather than at the school or school-by-year level. Another benefit of examining
school-by-grade-by-year level turnover is that we can adjust for school-by-grade or school-by-year
level factors that could influence both student achievement and turnover. For example, if the
school’s principal leaves the transition could simultaneously affect both turnover and achievement.
If we do not measure this effect then our results would be biased, showing an association between
turnover and achievement even if no causal relationship exists. Focusing on school-by-grade-byyear level turnover allows us to adjust for school-by-year level factors, both observed and not
observed.
For each analysis we use two different estimation strategies to study the effects of school-by
grade level teacher turnover on student achievement. First, we use regression models with schoolby-grade fixed effects to leverage variation in turnover across years within the same grade level and
school. This allows us to examine whether students within the same grade level and within the same
school had better or worse test score gains in a given year, as compared to other years when teacher
turnover was at different rates. All models control for prior student achievement, but we also
control for other student, class, school, grade, and teacher characteristics depending on the analysis.
Equation 1 summarizes the regression model used for these analyses:

Aitgsy = β0 + β1Aitgs(y-1) + β2OtherAitgs(y-1) + β3Χitgsy + β4Ctgsy + β5Ssy +ɸy + νgs + β6Tgsy + εitgsy (1)

The test performance of individual, i, with teacher, t, in grade, g, in school, s, in time, y, is a function
of his/her test performance in that subject, A, and the other subject, AOther, in the prior year,
student background characteristics, X, time varying classroom characteristics, C, time varying school
characteristics, S, year fixed effects, ɸ, grade-by-school fixed effects, ν, the grade-by-school-by-year
turnover measure, T, and an error term, ε.
In our second method of analyses, we use school-by-year, instead of school-by-grade, fixed
effects to capitalize on turnover variation across grades within the same year and school. The
advantage of the second method is that year-to-year variations cannot explain observed effects;
however, the disadvantage is that it assumes turnover rates have comparable effects on student
achievement at different grade levels. All models control for prior student achievement, but we also
control for other student, class, school, grade, and teacher characteristics depending on the analysis.
Equation 2 describes the second method of analysis:

Aitgsy = β0 + β1Aitgs(y-1) + β2OtherAitgs(y-1) + β3Χitgsy + β4Ctgsy + β5Ssy +ɸg + νsy + β6Tgsy + εitgsy (2)

The test performance of individual, i, with teacher, t, in grade, g, in school, s, in time, y, is a function
of his/her test performance in that subject, A, and the other subject, AOther, in the prior year,
student background characteristics, X, time varying classroom characteristics, C, time varying school
characteristics, S, grade fixed effects, ɸ, year-by-school fixed effects, ν, the grade-by-school-by-year
turnover measure, T, and an error term, ε.
What explains the relationship between teacher turnover and student achievement? There
are multiple potential mechanisms leading to the effects of turnover that we estimate in Equations 1
and 2. For example, turnover may affect achievement because the teachers who replaced those who

7

left were either more or less effective (we refer to this as the “compositional” effect). Alternatively,
even where the arriving and leaving teachers were equally effective, the turnover itself may cause a
broader disruption that impacts all students, even students of teachers who did not transition (we
refer to this as the “disruption” effect).
To examine the effect of differentially effective teachers we add teacher experience indictor
variables to see whether any observed turnover effects are driven by changes in experience of the
teachers; we then add an indicator variable for being a new teacher in the school to see whether any
observed effects are driven by teachers who are new to the school being worse. We also run
separately models that control for teachers’ average prior value-added to see if the effect is driven by
changes in the effectiveness of teachers leaving and entering grade level teams.
The drawback to this approach of controlling for measured teacher characteristics is that
there may be unmeasured characteristics of teachers that differ between new and remaining teachers
that affect student performance. In order to further distinguish the disruption effect from the
compositional effect, we rerun our analyses but only for students who had teachers who were in the
same grade-by-school group in the prior year (i.e. students of “stayers”). If there were no disruption
effects, we should not see an effect of turnover for students in this group. We run these analyses for
the models in both Equation 1 and Equation 2.
Another approach we used to dissect the relationship between teacher turnover and student
achievement was to look at whether the relationship varied in different kinds of schools. For
example, during the period of this study, NYC opened a number of new schools, many of which
were small and expanding. To see whether our results were driven by these new schools we ran
models separately for large versus small schools, and for new versus old schools. Additionally, many
have suggested that the effects of turnover will be most harmful in schools with more lowperforming and minority students, especially given that the turnover rates tend to be higher in these

8

kinds of settings. To test whether the effects of turnover are different in schools with these
populations of students we ran models separately in low versus high performing schools, and in low
versus high percentage black schools.

RESULTS
What is the average effect of teacher turnover on student achievement?
Table 2 describes the results for our estimates of the effects of teacher turnover on student
achievement when comparing students within the same grade within the same school but in
different years (grade-by-school fixed effects models). Model 1 includes year fixed effects as well as
school-by-grade fixed effects, while Model 2 adds in student, class, and school-level controls.5 Note
that each estimate in Table 2 comes from a separate estimation. The estimations vary in their
outcome variable (math or ELA) and in their measure of turnover (proportion of new teachers or
lagged attrition). The estimated coefficients are negative and significant for test scores in both ELA
and math and for all model specifications, suggesting that the students of teachers in the same grade
level team in the same school do worse in years where teacher turnover rates are higher, as
compared to years with less teacher turnover. Student math scores are six to seven percent of a
standard deviation lower in years when there was 100 percent turnover as compared to years where
there was no turnover at all. Effect sizes are somewhat smaller in ELA than in math, estimated at
between three and six percent of a standard deviation decrease.
Across models, estimates were somewhat larger when signaling teacher turnover using the
proportion of new teachers to a grade level team as compared to the proportion of teachers who left
a grade level team in the prior year. We are not certain why this is the case, but we suspect it may be
the result of differences in the sensitivity of measures to variation in turnover across years where
Table 1 describes the student controls used in these models; Appendix Table 1 describes the classroom and school
controls.

there was growth or decline in the number of teachers within a particular grade-by-school. To
illustrate, Table 3 includes three different scenarios – when there is an increase in the number of
teachers in a hypothetical 4th grade in a hypothetical School A; when there is a decline in the number
of teachers; and when the number of teachers stays the same. As the table demonstrates, the lagged
attrition measure may be less sensitive to changes caused by turnover in growth years. On the other
hand, in decline years, the proportion new measure may fail to detect changes due to turnover. In
the five-year period we studied in NYC, we found that grade-by-school teams experienced average
increases in faculty size in grades 4 and 5;6 this average growth may explain why the lagged attrition
estimates were relatively lower.
Table 4 describes the estimates for models using school-by-year fixed effects instead of
school-by-grade fixed effects. Looking across models and measures, the results are similar. The
consistently negative and statistically significant estimates again suggest that teacher turnover harms
student achievement. More specifically, the results indicate that within the same school and within
the same year, students in grade levels that experience100 percent turnover had lower test scores by
four to seven percent of a standard deviation in math and by three to seven percent of a standard
deviation in ELA, as compared to grade levels with no turnover at all. As with models using schoolby-grade fixed effects, estimates were consistently lower when signaling turnover with lagged
attrition as compared to the proportion of new faculty.
To get a better sense about the magnitude of the effects, we examined the effects at different
quartiles of teacher turnover. Table 5 describes grade-by-school-by-year-level characteristics at
different quartiles of teacher turnover. The bottom quartile (least turnover) is comprised of only
grade levels in schools that experienced no teacher turnover; in the second quartile an average of 13
6 We examined grade-by-school level growth by creating measure for the difference between years in the number of
teachers per grade level per school: Difference = Number of teachers (n) – Number of teachers (n-1). By averaging
difference scores across years and school-by-grade levels we calculated a mean difference score of about 0.3 for our
sample. This suggests an average yearly growth of 0.3 teachers within a grade level within a school.

percent of teachers left, in the third quartile approximately one-quarter left, and in the fourth
quartile over one-half left. As compared to school-by-grades in the top quartile of turnover, those in
the bottom quartile had more high-achieving and Asian students, fewer poor, black, and Hispanic
students, and fewer student absences and suspensions.
Table 6 shows the estimates for the effects of teacher turnover on student achievement by
quartile of turnover. The first column displays estimates for models employing school-by-year fixed
effects, while estimates in the second column come from models with school-by-grade fixed effects.
All models control for student, classroom, and school characteristics. Depending on the model and
signal for turnover, students experiencing rates of teacher turnover in the second quartile have
statistically similar to 1 percent of a standard deviation higher math achievement as compared to
students experiencing the least (bottom quartile) teacher turnover. Students in the third quartile are
scoring 1.5 to 2 percent of a standard deviation lower, while those in the fourth quartile are scoring
about 3 percent of a standard deviation lower. This suggests that reducing teacher attrition rates
from one-quarter of teachers leaving to none corresponds with an increase in student math
achievement of about 2 percent of a standard deviation. Reducing teacher attrition rates from
approximately one-half to none corresponds with an increase of about 3 percent of a standard
deviation, an amount that other researchers have suggested to be meaningful. Given there are about
6 teachers per every grade-by-school, in an average grade level in an average school this would be
the difference between a year (or grade) where three teachers left and one where none left. We are
likely underestimating the true effect since we are really identifying idiosyncratic turnover – across
grades (within a school and year) or across years (within a grade and school). If being in a
systematically high turnover grade level and school has additional negative effects we are missing
these additional effects with our identification strategy.

11

Are the effects different for different kinds of schools?
Prior literature suggests that the turnover rates are especially high in schools with more lowperforming and minority students (Scafidi, Stinebrickner, and Sjoquist, 2003; Hanushek, Kain and
Rivkin, 2004; Boyd et al., 2010; Boyd, Lankford, Loeb and Wyckoff, 2005). Moreover, it is typically
more challenging to fill vacancies in these kinds of schools with qualified teachers (Boyd et al.,
2011). Thus, many have argued that the effects of teacher turnover are probably most harmful to
students in schools with underserved student populations. However, estimates in the recent study by
Hanushek and Rivkin (2010) suggest the opposite to be true -- that turnover may exert a lower cost
on schools with higher populations of low-achieving and black students as compared to schools
with fewer of these student populations.
In order to examine this matter further, we analyzed whether the effects of teacher turnover
were similar or different in schools with more low-achieving and black students as compared to
schools with fewer of these student populations. We did this by re-running analyses separately only
with schools whose students averaged below the test score mean and then only with schools that
had at least 20 percent black students.7 For comparison’s sake, we also examined schools with
students scoring at or above the mean on test scores, and with black student populations of less than
or equal to 20 percent.
Table 7a presents results for models using school-by-grade fixed effects, while Table 7b
presents results for models using school-by-year fixed effects. Across math and ELA, and across
measures for teacher turnover, the negative effect of teacher turnover on student achievement was
larger in schools with higher proportions of low-achieving and black students. The results were

7 We used 20 percent as the cutoff score as this was close to the median value. This assured we had similar number of
observations in each group: 314,000 in schools with 20 percent or more and 309,000 in schools with less than 20 percent
of students that were black.

12

particularly striking in relation to ELA test scores. Regardless of the model specification, the harmful
effects of turnover on ELA achievement were generally two to four times stronger in schools with
larger proportions of black and low-achieving students, as compared to schools with smaller
proportions of these typically underserved populations. ELA estimates did not even reach
statistically significant levels in schools with few low-achieving and black students.
In math, estimates were negative and significant in both low and high achieving schools, but
were larger in low-achieving schools. In models using school-by-grade fixed effects, estimates were
about twice as big. However, in models using school-by-year fixed effects, the estimates were only
marginally bigger in math. Similarly, estimates for the effect of turnover on math achievement were
consistently negative and significant in schools with large and small proportions of black students.
Again, effects sizes were consistently larger in schools with large proportions of black students.
Tables 8a and 8b compare estimates for old (more than 10 years old) versus new (10 or
fewer years old) schools and for big (8 or more teachers per grade level) versus small schools (fewer
than 8 teachers per grade level). Across models, estimates are negative and mostly significant,
suggesting that turnover has a harmful effect of on student achievement across kinds of schools.
While the estimated turnover effects are negative and generally significant in new and small schools,
they are larger in magnitude in old and big schools. These results indicate that new school reforms in
NYC are not driving the negative effects of turnover described above.

What explains the relationship between teacher turnover and student achievement?
There are many possible mechanisms by which teacher turnover can harm student
achievement. As described in the introduction, prior literature often focuses on the relationships
between teacher turnover and teacher quality to explain this effect. The assumed theory of action is
that teacher turnover changes the average effectiveness of teachers in the schools that, in turn,

13

changes student outcomes. More specifically, the effect of turnover is driven by the relative
effectiveness of the teachers who leave a school, as compared to those who replace them. We test
this by including in our models two signals for teacher quality – experience and lagged value-added –
to test whether changes in teaching experience or prior effectiveness at raising test scores explain the
harmful effects of turnover on student achievement that we observe. To measure experience we
used indicators variables for each year of experience up to 20 years. Because the first year in a
school may be especially difficult, even for experienced teachers, we also added a control for
whether the teacher moved from a different school.
Tables 9a and 9b show estimates for models examining whether teaching experience and
migration explain the effects of teacher turnover on student achievement. We begin with the base
model in Model 1, add experience indicators in Model 2, and then add an indicator for whether a
teacher is new to the school (mover or first year teacher) in Model 3. Table 7a describes results for
models using school-by-grade fixed effects; Table 7b describes models using school-by-year fixed
effects. In both tables, Model 2 estimates are consistently lower than those in Model 1 but still
statistically significant. These results indicate that changes in teacher experience explain some of the
effect teacher turnover on student achievement, although a significant amount of the effect remains
unexplained. Compared to Model 2, Model 3 estimates are also somewhat smaller but still
statistically significant. These results suggest that teachers who migrated from other schools were, on
average, less effective, and that this accounted for some of the harmful effects of teacher turnover
on student achievement. However, Model 3 estimates remained statistically significant indicating
other factors, beyond teaching experience and migration, also explain the effects of teacher turnover
on student achievement.
One of the most likely remaining explanatory factors is teachers’ prior effectiveness at
improving student achievement (Hanushek and Rivkin, 2010). While there is no perfect way of

14

measuring teacher effectiveness, regression-based, value-added measures are the current standard.
We can calculate value-added measures for a subsample of teachers in the sample.8 As a result of
missing data, our overall sample sizes were reduced by almost half – for math, student observations
reduced from about 625,000 to about 382,000; for ELA, observations reduced from 515,707 to
302,072. Tables 10a and 10b show estimates for models using only the subsample of teachers for
whom we have data on prior value-added. Model 1 include estimates for the effect of teacher
turnover on student achievement for this subsample; Model 2 controls for teachers’ average prior
value-added9 to see if prior effectiveness explains any observed effects in Model 1. These tables
show that, even with the reduced sample of teachers for whom we have data on prior value-added,
the estimates of the effects of teacher turnover on student achievement remain negative and mostly
significant, though were somewhat smaller. After controlling for teachers’ average prior value-added,
estimate sizes reduce substantially and are generally no longer statistically significant. These results
suggest that changes in teachers’ effectiveness explain much of the observed relationship between
teacher turnover and student achievement, although the substantially diminished power as a result of
the reduced sample may have driven these results.
Because we found the effects of teacher turnover to be especially deleterious in lowerachieving schools, we reproduce the value-added analyses separately in lower-achieving and higherachieving schools. Tables 10a and 10b shows that, with the reduced sample, the turnover effect is
negative and significant in lower-achieving schools, but that there is no significant effect in higherachieving schools. Moreover, the effect of teacher turnover remains negative and, in most cases,
statistically significant even after controlling for prior value-added. Thus, teachers’ prior

8 All first year teachers are dropped from this analysis because we do not have student test score data in prior years. For
experienced teachers we were unable to estimate value-added for all prior years. To keep our sample as large as possible
we decided to use the average of all prior value added estimates as a signal for prior effectiveness.

effectiveness does not appear to explain fully the harmful effects of turnover on student
achievement in lower-achieving schools.
If not teacher experience, migration, or prior effectiveness, then what else might account for
the harmful effects of teacher turnover on student achievement, particularly in low-achieving
schools? It is beyond the scope of this study to identify and test all possible mechanisms by which
turnover may harm student achievement. However, one way to begin to identify how turnover
impacts student achievement is to examine whether the effects of teacher turnover accrue only to
students who have teachers who are new to the grade-level team in their school or whether the
effects of turnover are also felt by students whose teachers had remained. If the students of stayers
are harmed by teacher turnover, it would cast further doubt on the hypothesis that turnover harms
student achievement only through the relative effectiveness of the teachers who leave as compared
to those that replace them. It would suggest that the rotation of teachers has an influence beyond
just those students of teachers who were coming and going, to somehow negatively impact even the
students who were assigned to teachers who stayed in the same school from year to year. To test
this, we examined the effects of turnover separately for teachers who were stayers, movers, and
rookies (first year) to see the extent to which the students of these groups of teachers experienced
the effects of turnover differently. Given prior evidence that the effect of turnover manifests
primarily in lower-achieving schools, we continued to analyze low and high achieving schools
separately.
Table 11a shows the results for models using school-by-grade fixed effects while Table 11b
shows results for models using school-by-year fixed effects. There is a consistent pattern for stayers
– in lower achieving schools, their students perform significantly worse when turnover is greater;
while in higher-achieving schools there is no effect. For movers, the effects of turnover vary
according to model specifications, and there is no clear pattern as to whether turnover is more or

16

less harmful in lower or higher achieving settings. In general, there is a negative relationship between
turnover and achievement for students of movers, although the effect is not always significant.
Lastly, there are no significant effects of turnover on the student achievement of first year teachers,
regardless of model or kind of school. This result suggests that first year teachers do equally well at
improving student achievement regardless of the turnover rate in their grade.

DISCUSSION
This study finds some of the first empirical evidence for a direct effect of teacher turnover
on student achievement. Results demonstrate that teacher turnover has a significant and negative
effect on student achievement in both math and ELA. Moreover, teacher turnover is particularly
harmful to students in schools with large populations of low-performing and black students.
Much of the existing literature assumes that teacher turnover impacts student achievement
by changing the average quality of teachers in schools. That is, if the teachers who leave a school are
worse than those who replace them, then turnover will have a net positive effect. In this view,
stayers are merely bystanders who do not affect and are not affected by turnover.
Although this study finds evidence that changes in teacher quality explain some of the effect
of turnover on student achievement, the results suggest there may be disruptional effects of
turnover beyond these compositional effects. First, results show that turnover has a harmful effect
on student achievement, even after controlling for different indicators of teacher quality, especially
in lower-performing schools. Also, we find that turnover negatively affects the students of stayers –
those who remain in the same school from one year to the next as well the students in the
classrooms of new teachers. Thus, turnover must have an impact beyond simply whether incoming
teachers are better than those they replaced – even the teachers outside of this redistribution were
somehow harmed by it. Although this study does not identify the specific mechanism by which

17

turnover harms students, it provides guidance on where to look. The findings indicate that turnover
has a broader, harmful influence on student achievement since it can reach beyond just those
students of teachers who left or of those that replaced them. Any explanation for the effect of
turnover must possess these characteristics. One possibility is that turnover negatively affects
collegiality or relational trust among faculty; or perhaps turnover results in loss of institutional
knowledge among faculty that is critical for supporting all student learning. More research is needed
to identify the specific mechanism.
This study also makes methodological contributions. Often the effects of turnover are
analyzed at the school-level, an approach that makes the questionable assumption that the effects of
turnover are comparable across different kinds of schools. Instead, we utilize two innovative
modeling approaches that do not make this assumption. The first identifies turnover variation across
years within the same grade level and within the same school to examine whether students had better or worse
test score gains in a given year, as compared to other years when teacher turnover was at different
rates. The second identifies turnover variation across grade levels within the same year and within the same
school to examine whether students in grade levels with higher or lower turnover rates also had higher
or lower achievement gains. Though an improvement over school-level analyses, both of these
methods also make questionable assumptions. The former assumes the effects of turnover rates
within the same grade and school are comparable across years; the latter assumes that turnover
effects within the same school and year are comparable across grade levels. Despite concerns over
potential bias introduced by these assumptions, that findings were similar across methodological
approaches suggests that we may have detected a true effect.
Finally, the findings of this study also have policy implications. Though there may be cases
where turnover is actually helpful to student achievement, on average, it is harmful. One possibility
might be to introduce incentive structures to retain teachers that might leave otherwise.

18

Implementing such policies may be especially important in schools with large populations of lowperforming and black students, where turnover has the strongest negative effect on student
achievement.
