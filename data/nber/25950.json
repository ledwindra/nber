    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper studies green bonds, a relatively new instrument in sustainable finance. I first describe the market for green bonds and characterize the \u201cgreen bond boom\u201d witnessed in recent years. Second, using firm-level data on green bonds issued by public companies, I examine companies\u2019 financial and environmental performance following the issuance of green bonds. I find that the stock market responds positively to the announcement of green bond issues. Moreover, I document a significant increase in environmental performance, suggesting that green bonds are effective in improving companies\u2019 environmental footprint. These findings are only significant for green bonds that are certified by independent third parties, suggesting that certification is an important governance mechanism in the green bond market. I conclude by discussing potential implications for public policy.\n\n",
