Aging and Death under a Dollar a Day

ABSTRACT
This paper uses household survey data form several developing countries to investigate whether the
poor (defined as those living under $1 or $2 dollars a day at PPP) and the non poor have different mortality
rates in old age. We construct a proxy measure of longevity, which is the probability that an adult's
mother and father are alive. The non-poor's mothers are more likely to be alive than the poor's mothers.
Using panel data set for Indonesia and Vietnam, we also find that older adults are significantly more
likely to have died five years later if they are poor. The direction of causality is unclear: the poor may
be poor because they are sick (and thus more likely to die), or they could die because they are poor.

actress.

Introduction
Despite the many assurances from many wise men that being rich is not all that it is made
out to be, most economists remain firmly in Ms. West’s camp. This is partly no doubt an
item of faith not unrelated to what makes people want to be economists. But mostly it
reflects the suspicion that, at least up to a point, what are usually called necessities of life
are really necessary, and having to do without them cannot be pleasant.

To what extent are the poor deprived of the necessities of life? Obviously this turns on
who we call the poor. One popular definition, which we adopt, is to focus on those who
have a daily per capita expenditure of a dollar a day (at PPP) or less. We call them the
very (or extremely) poor to distinguish them from the merely poor, who live on less than
$2 a day. In a previous essay (Banerjee and Duflo, 2007a), we used household surveys
from thirteen countries and draw on existing research to look at what the poor can afford.
From these it appears that even the extremely poor can afford to buy enough calories to
keep going, though whether they always prioritize that over other things they could buy is
not entirely clear. At least in some countries there seems to be evidence that the
extremely poor are actually short on calories and other nutrients, relative to the standard
norms for their country. In India, the poorest seem to live on less than 1500 calories a day
compared to a norm of over 2000, and moreover, this number seems to be going down
over time . Where there is more detailed health information, such as in a survey we
carried out in rural Udaipur district (Banerjee, Deaton and Duflo (2004)), it is also clear
that the very poor betray signs of undernourishment: 65% of adult men and 40% of adult
women have BMIs under 18.5, which is the standard cut-off for being underweight.

How do the very poor do in terms of other necessities? Most of them seem to have a
place to stay and some minimal clothing—what else should we be looking for? Perhaps
one way to answer that is to look at some of the things that the people immediately richer
than them seem to have, that they may not. This is one of things that we did in Banerjee
and Duflo (2007b): we used the same surveys to compare the poor with two groups of
slightly richer people in the same countries. These are households whose daily per capita
expenditures valued at purchasing power parity (henforth, DPCE) are between $2 and $4
and those whose DPCE are between $6 and $10. While clearly much better off than the
very poor, and much better placed in the consumption distribution of their respective
countries, these are still poor households by developed country standards: the poverty
line in the US for someone who lives in a family of five, for example, works out to be
about $13 per day.

Compared to the poor, the less poor spend more per visit to the doctor and more per child
educated. They are more likely to send their children to school, more likely to see a
doctor when they feel sick, and more inclined to see a private doctor rather than a public
practitioner. They also have much greater access to water, sanitation and public
infrastructure: the fraction with tap water at home increases with DPCE in most countries
(and in some countries by quite a large margin): from 12% (for the extremely poor) to
73% (for those with DPCE between $6 and $10) in rural Cote d’Ivoire, 2% to 63% in
rural Tanzania and 12% to 55% in Nicaragua. In urban areas, in seven countries out of
the nine for which we have data, 70% or more of the households with DPCE between $6
and $10 have tap water, whereas the share is below 50% in all countries but one for the
extremely poor. The same pattern holds for latrines (where the share of those who have
latrinces among the households with DPCE between $6 and $10 is above 80% in seven
countries) and electricity (the share that has access to electricity in this group is above
90% in seven countries).

These differences obviously suggest a better quality of life for the less poor, though these
surveys cannot tell us what, if anything, they are giving up in terms of connectedness in

the community or the consumption of leisure (for all it is worth, when asked in surveys,
the non-poor always report more life satisfaction than the poor). Do we also see cruder,
more tangible, differences between them, say in terms of differences in the risk of dying?
And if so, by how much? It is known (see e.g. Wagstaff, 2002) that infant mortality is
greater among the poor than among the richer households. Is the same true among adults?
This is the set of questions that we set out to answer here.

Data sources

We mainly used the Living Standard Measurement Surveys (LSMS) conducted by the
World Bank and the “Family Life Surveys” conducted by the Rand Corporation, all of
which are publicly available.2 We have data for 15 countries from these sources: Brazil,
Bangladesh, Cote d’Ivoire, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan,
Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, South Africa, Tanzania, and East Timor. In addition,
we also use two surveys that we conducted in India with our collaborators. The first was
carried out in 2002 and 2003 in 100 hamlets of Udaipur District, Rajasthan (Banerjee,
Deaton, and Duflo, 2004). Rural Udaipur is one of the poorer areas of India, with a large
population of tribals (the term used in India to designate people who used to be so low in
the Hindu caste hierarchy that they had no official place in it) and an unusually high level
of female illiteracy (at the time of the 1991 census, only 5 percent of women were literate
in rural Udaipur). Our second survey covered 2,000 households in “slums” (or informal
neighborhoods) of Hyderabad, the capital of the state of Andhra Pradesh and one of the
boomtowns of post-liberalization India (Banerjee, Duflo, and Glennerster, 2006). We
chose these countries and surveys because they provide detailed information on
extremely poor households around the world, from Asia to Africa to Latin America,
including information on what they consume, where they work, and how they save and
borrow.

See Frankenberg and Karoly (1995), Frankenberg and Thomas (2000), Strauss et al (2004).

From each of these surveys we compute the consumption per capita in PPP terms, using
the 1993 purchasing power parity (PPP) as the benchmark.3 We identify the extremely
poor as those living in households where the consumption per capita is less than $1.08
per person per day, as well as the merely “poor” defined as those who live under $2.16 a
day using 1993 purchasing power parity (PPP) as benchmark. In keeping with
convention, we call these the $1 and $2 dollar poverty lines, respectively. For
comparison, we then added two additional groups: those living between 2 and 4 dollars a
day, and those living between 6 and 10 dollars a day.

Age pyramids: Missing old people?

One first approach (although we are going to see its limitations shortly) to get at the
question of “excess” mortality is to look at the age distribution of the population: is the
number of older people in the population unusually low?

Tables A1 and A2 in the appendix show the fraction of the sample that lives under 1
dollar a day, under 2 dollars a day, between 2 and 4 dollars a day, and between 6 and 10
dollars a day, in different age groups.4 Tables 1 and 2 show summary ratios: the fraction
of young (less than 18) in the population, and the ratio of those over 50 over all adults
(21+), broken down by gender and for the overall population.

The first striking (and well known) fact is that the very poor form a remarkably young
group. The ratio of the population under 18 over the total population among the rural
extremely poor range from 40% (Indonesia) to 60% (Panama). In urban areas it ranges
from 34% (Indonesia again, in 2000) to 63%. This ratio falls substantially in all countries
as people get slightly richer, although it remains high even then (it ranges between 35%
3

The use of consumption, rather than income, is motivated by the better quality of the
consumption data in these surveys (Deaton, 2004).

In this and all that follows, the observations are weighted by the survey weights if appropriate (multiplied
by household size when the data is first aggregated at the household level) so that these should be estimate
of population means.

and 42% for those with DPCE between 6 and 10 dollars a day in rural area, and 28% to
42% for the urban areas).

Part of the reason is of course that fertility is high among the poor, and as a result there
are a lot of children. But there are also comparably few older people. The ratio of people
aged 50 and above to adults over 20 among the rural extremely poor ranges between 15%
(in Papua New Guinea) to 34% (Indonesia, 1997). Compared to other indicators of how
the poor live, it is actually strikingly similar across these countries, clustered around 20%
for most of them. In the US, the corresponding ratio was 38% in 2000 (2000 census).
This in itself is however not sufficient to conclude that the poor die more in developing
countries than people do in the US, since the fertility rates are also higher in poorer
countries. As a result the number of younger people at any point in time is mechanically
higher, compared to the number of older people in those countries, compared to in the
US. So these “missing old people” may just be people who were never born.

Is there an income gradient in the ratio of older people over the total number of adults
within countries? In most countries, the ratio of old people over all adults is similar when
we look at either the poor or the extremely poor. However, in nine countries out of
fifteen, in the rural areas, there are comparatively more old people among the slightly
more well off people ($2-$4 and $6-$10) than among the poorer people: For example, in
Udaipur district (rural India) the ratio of old to adults increases from 22% among the poor
to 34% among those living on between $2 and $4 dollars a day. Likewise in Peru, the
ratio increases from 24% to 31% in the same categories (in both countries, we have too
few people with DPCE between $6 and $10 to give meaningful statistics). We get similar
numbers for Pakistan and Vietnam . In Nicaragua and Panama respectively, it increases
from 22% to 35% between the extremely poor and those living between $6 and $10, and
in Panama it increases from 25% to 35% in the same categories. In all those countries, the
ratio of old to prime-age adults among the more well off is almost similar to what it is in
the US, despite the fact that these people are still very poor by US standards, and despite
the much better public health environment in the US.

In four other countries (Guatemala, Indonesia, Mexico and Tanzania), the ratio does not
change with income. In the remaining two---South Africa and Ivory Coast---it actually
falls sharply (from 27% to 19% in rural South Africa, for example). One thing that is
common across these six countries is that the ratio of people in the 0-18 age group
compared to older people does not vary a lot between the extremely poor and those living
between $6 and $10 a day. This difference ranges from 2% (South Africa and Guatemala)
to 10% (Indonesia) in these six countries, whereas it ranges from 10% (Papua New
Guinea) to 30% (Brazil) in the other countries. While the share of those less than 18
today is a very imperfect proxy for the difference in fertility rate in the past, this suggests
the possibility that a part of the reason why some countries have many more young adults
compared to older adults among poorer people, is that the poorer people in those
countries have relatively more children.

The fact that three of the countries where we see a distinct pattern are in Africa points to
another general limitation of this exercise: We may be confusing the location decision of
the older people with the fact that they may be alive or not. For example in South Africa,
older people may live with their grandchildren while the parents are away working.
Unless they are receiving a pension (which is available after 60 for women and 65 for
men), the per capita consumption of such households might be particularly low (since
they have many children and no prime-age worker) compared to households without
older people.

A different choice of location may in turn explain the pattern we found in the other
countries: it is conceivable that older people choose to live with their richer children,
which would make the ratio of older people to adults artificially low among the poorest.
Of course, since we find the ratios are similar among the extremely poor and the poor,
and they start to differ only when we look at various categories, this does not seem very
likely, since it is not very likely that many old people have some children living under $1
a day and others above $2. But since we have no data on this, this remains a possibility.

A new measure of adult mortality: Are your parents alive?

Given that the age structure data turns out to be quite hard to interpret, it is fortunate that,
for a subset of countries, there is a way to address this problem: In some of the household
surveys (11 countries in total), the household roster contains a question on whether each
member’s father and mother are alive. For these countries, we present in table 3 the
fraction of those aged 35 to 50 whose father and mother are alive. These fathers and
mothers are likely to be above 50 (if they are alive), giving us a handle, albeit
approximate, on how the entire population of those aged 50 and above changes across the
different income categories. Note that to the extent that richer people have children later,
and that the children of richer people are rich as well, this will under-estimate any
difference in the age-adjusted mortality, since the parents of richer people aged between
35 and 50 will tend to be older.

In table 3A, we show the data for urban and rural households together (although in some
countries the data is available only for rural households. For women, there is a fairly clear
pattern: in four countries (Udaipur, Pakistan, South Africa and Bangladesh), the
probability that the mother of the respondent is alive does not really change between the
richest category for which we have data and the poorest one. In all the other countries, it
goes up with DPCE, and the difference between the richest and the poorest category for
which we have data ranges from 6 percentage points in Vietnam to 23 percentage points
in East Timor.

In most of the last group of countries (countries where the probability of a person’s
mother being alive is higher in the richest group than in the poorest), the pattern is one of
a monotonic increase. The probability that the respondents’ mother is alive goes up as
DPCE goes up, though in some countries we only see a sizeable gap among the most well
off (e.g. Brazil), while in others the critical break seems to be in the $2 and $4 range (e.g.
Mexico), and yet in others there is a steady increase across all the groups (e.g. Indonesia
in 1993).

For fathers, there is no clear picture: in seven surveys (but only five countries, since
Indonesia appears three times), the probability of the father being alive increases between
the richest and the poorest category. In four countries it declines. In two it is roughly
constant.

The gender gap here might reflect differences in the nature of the health problems faced
by men and women in their 50s and 60s. First, those men are older (since men have
children older than women), and their mortality naturally catches up across the age group
(since eventually everybody dies). Second, in these age groups, men often die of heart
disease, lung cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure, all of which may be related to
their pattern of consumption, and therefore potentially be more of a risk for those who
can afford to consume more. This is less true of women. Alternatively, it could be
pointing to a reverse causation. Young adults whose father is alive may be younger and
hence poorer, while since mothers tend to be younger and in any case have a higher life
expectancy at 40, having a mother alive may not be a signal of her son’s age. Below, we
solve this problem by controlling for the respondent’s age.

Looking at urban and rural dwellers separately (the interpretation of which is
complicated, since the urban dwellers may be migrants whose parents were themselves
rural dwellers), we reach similar conclusions: in rural areas, in Pakistan, Udaipur and
Bangladesh the probability of an individual’s mother being alive is roughly constant
between the poorest and those with DPCE between $2 and $4 (we do not have richer
people in the surveys in rural areas in those countries). It increases across category
everywhere else, and the difference usually lies between 10 and 20 percentage points. For
example, in Brazil the proportion of rural dwellers whose mother is alive increases from
63% to 72% across those two categories. In Indonesia it increases from 52% to 65%. In
Mexico it increases from 57% to 74%, etc…

For fathers, once again, there is no obvious pattern: the probability of the father being
alive is greater among the richer households in seven surveys (and five countries),
roughly constant in two, and decreasing in four countries.

And finally, for urban dwellers, in Nicaragua and South Africa the probability of the
mother being alive declines somewhat as we go towards richer households; it is roughly
constant in three surveys, and increases in six. For men, we have a clearer pattern than for
the rural areas: the probability decreases only in Pakistan. Elsewhere it is either roughly
constant (Indonesia in 1993, Nicaragua and Vietnam) or increasing (everywhere else).

Another way to look at this data is to perform simple descriptive regressions. We present
in table 4A and 4B the results of logit regressions where a dummy indicating whether a
respondent’s mother (or father) is alive is regressed on the respondent’s age and age
squared, as well as country dummies and indication of the economic welfare of the
household. We present country-by-country regressions in table 4A and, to save space, we
focus on the pooled rural and urban data and one specification: economic welfare is
regressed on the log of total monthly per capita expenditure expressed in 1993 PPP
dollars. This table confirms the pattern revealed by the descriptive statistics for mothers,
and gives somewhat stronger results for men: There is an insignificant, sometime mildly
negative, relationship between the probability that a respondents’ mother and father are
alive in Udaipur, Pakistan, and Bangladesh (except for a significant negative relationship
between the probability that the father is alive and monthly per capita expenditure in
Udaipur). Elsewhere, the coefficients are positive, and in most cases significant at least at
the 10% level (except in the first wave of the IFLS for both mothers and fathers, for
mothers in Cote d’Ivoire, and for fathers in Indonesia, 2000).

Finally, to summarize all the patterns in this section, we present in table 4B regression
using data from all the countries pooled together (all the regressions control for a set of
country dummies).5 In panel A, death is regressed on the logarithm of monthly capita
expenditure (expressed in 1993 PPP dollars) in panel A, and the consumption categories
in panel B. In panel B, we exclude the “below 2” dollars a day category, so that the
coefficients should all be read in relation to those between $1 and $2 dollar a day.
Overall, we do see a strong association between log (monthly per capita expenditure) and
5

As well as the IFLS wave for Indonesia

the probability that one’s mother is alive, with similar coefficients in rural and urban
areas. For fathers, the relationship is also strong overall, but insignificant in rural areas.
Even in rural areas, however, those with DPCE between $6 and $10 are more likely to
have their father alive, relative to the poor.

This data, which does not suffer from the obvious problems of fertility differential and
endogenous locations, suggests that, conditional on reaching adulthood, the poor are
significantly less likely to reach old age than the less poor.

This obviously does not rule out the possibility that the dearth of older people in poorer
households is also partly driven by the decision of which child to live with. Table A3
looks at this question directly: we ask whether poorer or richer adults are likely to have
their parents live with them, conditional, obviously, on the parents being alive. The
answer to this question, interestingly, turns out to vary quite a lot across countries. In the
rural areas of six countries out of 12, mothers are more likely to live with their grown up
children among households with DPCE between $2 and $4. In one country (Pakistan),
the ratio is more or less constant. Within countries, the effect of income is not
monotonous: out of the seven countries where children who are between $2 and $4
dollars a day are more likely to have their mother living with them than the poor, in all
but one of the ones for which we have data for the $6 to $10 dollars a day group, the
share is lower for that last group than for the $2-4 group. The pattern for men is
somewhat different: there are in fact two cases (Bangladesh and East Timor) where the
probability of co-residence decreases in income for men while increasing for women.

Note that out of the six countries where the ratio of old to young among adults was lower
among the rich than among the poor, we have information on whether parents are alive
and where they live for five. Out of these five countries, four (Mexico, Indonesia, South
Africa, and Ivory Coast) are also countries where richer children were less likely to live
with their mother than the extremely poor. This suggests that the choice of residence
among the old people might have explained at least a part of why there seem to be
“missing” older people in poorer households.

To our knowledge, there is very little evidence on adult mortality by income groups in
developing countries. For the reasons discussed above, age pyramids cannot be used to
generate such evidence, and it is rare to have data on mortality and on poverty status in
the same data sets. This quick panorama based on whether parents are alive seems to
establish that in many countries, at least among women, the poor have higher adult
mortality than the non-poor (of course it does not tell us anything about the key question
of causality---do the poor die or are the dying poor?)

The best way to establish whether the poor really die more than the non-poor, however, is
to use a panel data set to measure the mortality of those identified as poor over the next
few years. It is not possible for most of our countries, but there are three where the
necessary panel data is available: Udaipur (India), Indonesia (IFLS), and Vietnam.

Age specific mortality rates: Indonesia-Vietnam-India

The Indonesian Family Life Survey is a panel, of which three waves have already been
completed: the first one was fielded in 1993, the second in 1997, and the last one in 2000.
For all waves, a lot of effort went into tracking down most of the respondent households
(Frankenberg, Thomas and Smith, 2003). When a household was re-interviewed in the
second or third phase, the entire household roster was carefully updated: the interviewers
worked with a pre-printed list of household members, and asked for each member
whether he/she still lived in the household and whether he/she is still alive. In addition,
we know if all the members of a given household died.

The Vietnam living standard measurement survey is a two wave panel, fielded in 1992/93
and 1997/1998. As in the Indonesian family life survey, the 1992/1993 household roster
was updated for all households that were part of the panel in 1997/1998, with information
for each member of whether they died in the intervening period.

Finally, the Udaipur survey will eventually also be a five year-panel, allowing us to carry
out the same exercise, but the endline survey has not been collected yet. Two data
sources are available for now: first, a comprehensive update of the household roster was
completed after one year. Second, each household is interviewed once a month to
monitor health status and health seeking behavior, and if anyone died, this is also
indicated in this survey. This survey has been going on for two years (in this version, we
only use the 1 year out mortality).

For all three surveys, we adopted the same method: we determine poverty status in the
first wave of the survey; then we compute the probability to have died by the next survey,
in different age groups, and notably among the older members.

Table 5 presents the results for Indonesia: in all age groups, there is very little difference
in death rates between the poor and the extremely poor, but the non-poor are less likely to
die than the poor and the extremely poor. This is true both five years out and ten years
out, and in both rural and urban areas. In rural areas, depending on the age group and
whether we look at five to ten years out, the extremely poor are 1.4 to 5 times more likely
to die than those who live between $6 and $10 dollars a day.

In terms of percentage points (and even in terms of ratio of percentages, for the rural
areas at least) the largest difference between the poor sand the non poor is seen for the
five-years out death rates of those aged 50 plus in rural areas. Overall, 15.3% of those
who were 50 and above in 1993 have died by 1997 among the extremely poor. The
number is very similar among all the poor (15.8%) but much lower among those who
were living between $6 and $10 a day (7%). The difference is particularly striking in
rural areas (15% versus 3%) and still large in urban areas (18% versus 11%).

By 2000, the ratios are much less skewed (22% versus 17% in the overall population),
suggesting that, among the richer households, many of the people who did not die by
1997 have died in the meantime. This is as we might have expected. Clearly by 2050, for
example, the ratio would be 100% in all income groups.

The patterns are strikingly similar in Vietnam (table 6). There again, the percentage who
died decline with economic welfare in all age groups, and this decline is particularly
steep among the older age group, in the rural areas. Overall, 14.4% of those aged 50 and
above who lived in extremely poor households in 1992/93 have died by 1997/98, versus
9.8% among those who were living in households with DPCE between $6 and $10. In
rural areas, the probabilities are respectively 15% and 5%. These numbers are very close
to the Indonesian numbers, and suggest that those numbers are unlikely to be just due to
chance: above 50, it seems the rural extremely poor are at least three times more likely to
die than the less poor.

It should be noted that those ratios indicate high mortality rates among the old, compared
to the USA: for example, in the HRS, 6% of the sample aged between 50 and 59 in the
first wave had died by 1998 (in six years).6

The results we have for Udaipur are not directly comparable to the results for Vietnam
and Indonesia, for two reasons: the mortality is only after one year, and there are almost
no households in the sample with consumption per capita between $6 and $10 a day.
Given the number of observations in each group, and for more clarity we present the
results for three groups: the extremely poor, those with DPCE between $1 and $2, and
those with DPCE above $2.

Despite these differences, the patterns we find in Udaipur are entirely consistent with
those for Indonesia and Vietnam. Here again, in all age groups, the mortality is higher for
the extremely poor than for the poor and the non-poor. And once again, the largest
difference in percentage point are found among the older people: The probability of
dying within a year is 5.8% for the extremely poor, 4.6% for the poor, and 3.4% for those
with DPCE above $2.

6

It should be noted that the HRS 1992 sample is younger, since only individuals ages 50 to 59 were
sampled. The unweighted average age in the HRS 1992 sample is 55.26, versus 62.6 among all those aged
55 or above in the Vietnamese survey.

In all three countries, death rates are thus higher for the poor at all consumption levels,
and in particular for the old. This higher mortality among the old is particularly striking
given that the poor tend to die more at every age, and therefore the surviving old poor
might be selected to be particularly healthy. One possible interpretation is that the
difference in lifestyle in this group, albeit incremental, does generate these differences in
mortality rates. Another possibility (and possibly both co-exist) is that poor health is
disabling, and responsible for maintaining those households in poverty.

Aging , Health and Poverty in India and Indonesia

To shed more light on these rather concerning statistics about death, we now examine the
correlation of age and health status among the poor and the less poor in two of the
surveys where we conducted the mortality analysis, where we also have detailed health
data: Udaipur and Indonesia.

For the two countries, we simply plot non-parametric regressions of a number of health
and mental health indicators on age separately by gender and by income groups: In
Udaipur we plot these graphs for the extremely poor (less than a dollar a day), the poor
($1 to $2 a day) and the non-poor (more than $2 a day). In Indonesia, we plot these
graphs for the extremely poor, the poor, those with DPCE between $2 and $4 and those
with DPCE between $6 and $10. Note that this cross-sectional correlation may
underestimate the deterioration of health with age (relative to a panel where people would
be compared over time), since the weakest people presumably disappear from the sample
as they age. Given the differential mortality we have described among the poor and nonpoor, this implies that there is a stronger negative bias among the poor than the non-poor,
and therefore that, everything else equal, we will tend to under-estimate any differences
in the slope of health with respect to age between the groups.

The indicators we look at are body mass index, hemoglobin levels and anemia (defined as
less hb below 12 g/dl for women and 13g/dl for men), lung capacity (measured as the
maximum of three peak flow meters reading), self reported health status, number of

activities of daily living that the person carries out with difficulty or not at all (excluding
eating, dressing, and going to the bathroom), and self reported well being (which is
available only in Udaipur). In addition we have signs of depression, measured differently
in both surveys: in Udaipur it is defined as the answer to the question “In the last twelve
months, was there a period of at least one month where you felt worried, tense or
anxious”. In Indonesia it is the number of symptoms over the last four weeks from
among: having difficulty sleeping, being bothered by things, feeling lonely, being sad,
being anxious, having difficulty concentrating and finding everything an effort.

In Udaipur (Udaipur figures, figures 1A to 12B), for most indicators, health seems to
deteriorate more strongly with age among the poor than the non-poor. Starting with
women, BMI for example, decreases with age, for the poorer categories, while it does not
among the non-poor. Anemia rises much more steeply with age among the extremely
poor than among the poor and it does not increase with age for the non-poor. The same
pattern can also be seen for self reported health status, number of symptoms of acute
morbidity, self reported well being, and symptoms of depression over the last year. The
only variables that do not follow this pattern are the ADL limitations, the peak flow meter
reading, and the time spent in squatting and getting up for 5 times (as well as the inability
or refusal to do it). Interestingly, the patterns for males are similar for all the objective
measures, and different for the self reported measures (self reported health status, number
of symptoms, symptoms of depressions). The responses to this last set of questions do not
always indicate a deterioration with age, and when they do, the slopes are similar for the
extremely poor, the poor and the non-poor. The only exception is self reported well
being, which actually is positively correlated with age for the 60 and 80 for the two richer
categories, and negatively for the poorest. It could be because men, and in particular
older men, are more reluctant to complain. Alternatively, given the Indian context, it is
quite likely that older women are substantially less well treated than older men, which
could increase both their likelihood of being depressed and their vulnerability to various
ailments.

On the whole, in Udaipur, a simple story can be told: as they get older, the poor get
comparably weaker and weaker, and they are also more likely to die. Again, it could be
that they were always frail (which is why they were poor), and so support age less well,
or it could be that poverty accelerates age’s damage on the body.

The same analysis for Indonesia does not reveal a similar pattern for all the objective
variables, where the slopes are very similar for the poor and non-poor. Hemoglobin
levels, if anything, are positively correlated with age among the poor, and negatively
among the non-poor. But here again, we find that women’s self reported health status,
depression symptoms, number of health complaints over the last months, all worsen more
with age for the poor than for the non-poor (note that in this data, a higher value for self
reported health status variables indicate worse health, not better). And once again, this is
not true for men.

Unlike Udaipur, there seems to be some tension between the health indicators and the
actual mortality in rural Indonesia. One can offer different conjectures for this
phenomenon. If one is prepared to take the subjective indicators seriously, one possible
explanation is that the “objective” indicators we have here (anemia, BMI, lung capacity,
time to squat and ADLs) are indicative of chronic conditions, which are often incurable,
at least for older people. However, because of their better access to sanitation and good
health care, the rich are less likely to be susceptible to acute conditions (hence the
differential age slopes for the number of symptoms they report), and also perhaps less
likely to die from them, in part because they are more likely to be treated (for example an
untreated cold for an older person may turn into a pneumonia and kill them, while a
younger person would recover from it). Another possibility, if one thinks that the
“subjective” measures reveal more about the psychology of the respondent than about
their real health status, is that the older poor people become comparatively unhappier
with age (the IFLS do not seem to have self reported happiness indices, but they do have
depression indicators for the past month and the old poor women are much more likely to
have those symptoms –figure 9A), which is also why they report more symptoms and

worst self reported health status. If this is true, they may then be less likely to effectively
fight illnesses, which, in turn, make him or her more likely to die.

Discussion and interpretation

This chapter brings together various pieces of evidence which all point in the same
direction: the poor, and particularly the extremely poor, have a lower chance of survival
than those who are somewhat more well-off. We have not tried to disentangle the
direction of the causality: these adults could be poor because they are in poor health,
which would then in turn explain why they are more likely to die. Or alternatively, being
poor could make them more likely to die. And of course both directions of causality may
be true at the same time. It is worth pointing out, however, that most old people in
developing countries live with other, younger, adults: in Vietnam for example, this is true
of 80% of the older adults. And if we restrict the sample to only those people who do live
with a younger adult, we find the same excess mortality rate among the poorer old people
than in the entire sample.

This weakens the case for a direct link going only from the health of the old people to the
poverty status of the household. This point is further strengthened by the fact that when
we look at older women in households where there are prime age adults, we continue to
find the same pattern (in Vietnam, for example, for women above 50 who live with
prime-age adults, the five-year mortality rate goes from 12% among the poor to 7.7%
among those with DPCE between $6 and $10). Since older women in households with
prime-age adults are very unlikely to be engaged in any market work, it is unlikely that it
is because they are unhealthy that the household is poor. To the extent poor health is in
part inherited, it could of course be the case that unhealthy old people live with unhealthy
younger adults, and this is the reason why the household is poor.
On balance, we are tempted to interpret the evidence accumulated in this paper as
revealing, at least in part, that poverty does kill.
