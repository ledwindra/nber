Platform Pricing at Sports Card Conventions

NBER Working Paper No. 17959
March 2012
JEL No. D4,L1,L8
ABSTRACT
We study a new data set of US sports card conventions in order to evaluate the pricing theory of two-sided
markets. Conventions are two-sided because organizers must set fees to attract both consumers and
dealers. We have detailed information on consumer price, dealer price and, since most conventions
are local, the market structure for conventions. We present several findings: first, consumer pricing
decreases with competition at any reasonable distance, but pricing to dealers is insensitive to competition
and in longer distances even increases with competition. Second, when consumer price is zero (and
thus constrained), dealer price decreases more strongly with competition. These results are compatible
with existing models of two-sided markets, but are difficult to explain without such models.

Introduction

The theory of platform competition and two-sided markets is an important recent development in industrial organization (see Armstrong, 2006; Caillaud & Jullien, 2003; Rochet & Tirole, 2006; Rysman,
2009; Weyl, 2010; Hagiu & Wright, 2011), but empirical work has been restricted. While the empirical
literature is growing, we argue below that significant gaps remain. In particular, there is little research
that focuses on descriptive analysis of data sets with a large number of platforms or in relatively simple
settings that are easily interpretable by theory. This paper analyzes sports card conventions in the US,
which must attract both buyers and sellers of cards to be successful. We provide a series of empirical
results, particularly about the relationship between competition and pricing, and especially competition
that we expect affects one side more than the other. Our results would be difficult to rationalize with a
one-sided market model, but we argue that our results can be generated by a model based on two-sided
markets. The theory of two-sided markets is difficult to test in the sense of falsifiability because it is
very flexible. Rather than a direct test, our aim is to provide descriptive results from a market that
appears to be two-sided, and discuss our results in the context of theoretical models. Our results go
beyond existing theoretical models in that we consider markets with many platforms, whereas existing
theoretical research considers markets with at most two. Thus, we evaluate whether intuition obtained
from duopoly markets can be extended to more complex market structures.
By definition, two-sided markets involve two (or more) groups of agents in which (1) agents interact
through an intermediary and (2) participation or usage of each group affects the utility of the other
groups. The intermediating firm is often referred to as a “platform” and each group of agent is referred
to as one “side” of the market. The economics of two-sided markets focus on agent’s choice of platform
and the pricing decisions of possibly competing platforms.1 Hagiu & Wright (2011) argue that this
literature would be better termed the study of “multi-sided platforms.”
For example, consumers value video game consoles that are served by many game developers, and
developers value consoles that attract many consumers. In this case, the console producer is the platform
firm, accounting for interactions between game players and game developers. Similarly, a local sports
card convention provides a platform for dealers of sports cards (most time acting as sellers) to interact
with consumers that visit the convention. Sports card dealers prefer conventions with many consumers
(holding competition constant) and consumers prefer conventions with many dealers.
For several reasons, sports card conventions provide an excellent environment to study the theory of
two-sided markets, particularly for the relationship between platform pricing and platform competition.
First, conventions are two-sided markets. A successful convention requires both buyers and dealers to
1 This

focus differentiates the literature on two-sided markets from the literature on network effects. The definition
of a two-sided market is very similar to the definition of a market with indirect network effects. However, the literature
on network effects tended to focus on technology adoption and network size, rather than the choices of the intermediary
(although this distinction is not perfect). For more on network effects, and definitional issues in two-sided markets, see
Farrell & Klemperer (2007), Rochet & Tirole (2006) and Rysman (2009).

appear at the convention, and a convention organizer must take this into account in setting prices.
Second, pricing is very simple and observable. Dealers and consumers pay separate entrance fees only.
There are no transaction fees or other complicating issues. We observe these fixed fees in a set of
uniformly formatted classified advertisements in a trade magazine. Third, there are a huge number of
conventions in the United States, more than two thousand per month at the height of their popularity,
which gives us tremendous leverage for econometric estimation, as well as important panel variation in
market structure.
In comparison, many two-sided markets (e.g. yellow pages directories, radio, internet search engine)
have zero price on one side and therefore restrict platform pricing to the other side only. Contexts in
which we see pricing on both sides are often complex. For example, video games consoles are a canonical
example of a two-sided market, but the number of important platforms and game developers are less
than 25, contracts are complex and secret, and technological change makes time series variation difficult
to interpret.
We highlight several empirical results. We show that consumer pricing responds to increases in
competition at any reasonable distance. However, pricing to dealers is more complex: it does not
respond to competition within relatively long distances, up to 100 miles. As we consider even longer
distances, past 100 miles, dealer prices actually increase in competition. We also distinguish between
dealer pricing by conventions that allow free consumer admission and those that charge consumers. We
interpret conventions that charge free admission, about half of our data set, to be constrained on the
consumer side. We show that conventions with free consumer admission reduce the price to dealers in
response to competition, whereas conventions with positive consumer admission do not change dealer
prices in response to competition.
We argue that these results are difficult to explain in a one-sided model: why would price increase
in or does not respond to competition if the firm has set price and responded negatively to competition
for another product in the market? However, these results arise naturally in reasonable models of twosided markets. For instance, if dealers multi-home (i.e. attend multiple conventions) and consumers
single-home (i.e. attend a single convention), increased competition between conventions (for instance,
exogenously moving them closer together) leads to lower prices for consumers but not for dealers. The
result that the single-homing side benefits more from competition than the multi-homing side is a common
result and appears in a number of set-ups (see Rochet & Tirole, 2003; Armstrong, 2006; Gomes, 2011).
A second result is that if both sides single-home, and consumer face higher travel costs than dealers,
prices fall on the consumer side but can actually increase on the dealer side. Intuitively, since increased
competition lowers market shares of consumers, the value of attracting dealers goes down, and the
platforms raise price. This result can be inferred from Weyl (2010) and we present a model in the
appendix that makes this point explicitly. Thus, a model in which consumers single-home and dealers
multi-home when competing conventions are nearby but single-home when they are far apart (i.e. greater
than 100 miles) generates the pricing pattern we observe. Our discussions with industry participants
3

suggest that this is a reasonable description of dealer behavior.
Armstrong & Wright (2007) and Gomes (2011) provide an interesting extension to the result that if
one side multi-homes, competition does not affect prices on the multi-homing side. If instead we consider
the case in which price is constrained on the single-homing side, then increases in competition do cause
price to fall on the multi-homing side. This result is consistent with our finding that dealer prices fall
in response to competition at conventions with free admission, but do not do so for conventions with
positive admission fees when dealers are likely to multi-home (within 100 miles).
Several papers seek to empirically evaluate two-sided markets. Rysman (2004) estimates the positive
feedback loop between advertising and entry in the Yellow Pages market and evaluates the welfare effects
of entry. Kaiser & Wright (2006) study pricing in the German magazine market, Argentesi & Filistrucchi
(2007) study market power in the Italian newspaper market, and Fan (2011) studies quality choice in
the U.S. newspaper market. Chandra & Collard-Wexler (2009) study newspaper pricing in the context
of mergers. Jeziorski (2011) analyzes merger behavior by U.S. radio stations. Lee (2010), Derdenger
(2011) and Corts & Lederman (2009) evaluate exclusive contracting in the video-game market. Cantillon
& Yin (2008) study tipping in financial exchanges. Genakos & Valletti (2011) show that lower call
termination revenue for cellular phone providers leads to higher fees to subscribers. Rysman (2007)
evaluates multi-homing and network effects in payment card usage.
Our paper differs from previous research in that we directly study pricing decisions using a descriptive
(or “reduced-form”) framework. These empirical results are useful because predictions about pricing
choices are, in our view, the major results of the two-sided markets literature so far. By taking a
reduced-form approach, we seek to shed light on whether correlations in the data are consistent with the
proposed theories. In contrast, most other papers that analyze pricing estimate an explicit theoretical
model using structural techniques, which makes it difficult to detect if the model does not hold. A
descriptive approach seems natural given that both the theoretical and empirical literatures are at such
an early stage.2

Industry and Data

Collecting sports cards and sports memorabilia is a popular pastime in the United States. Sports cards
are small cards with a picture of a professional player and the player’s statistics. Baseball cards are the
most popular. Collectors value cards of top players in top or rookie years, as well as complete sets and
well-produced cards. Collectors are often interested in other types of memorabilia, such as game balls,
jerseys or player signatures. The popularity of collecting cards can vary a great deal, including seasonally
with whether a sport is in season, and regionally with the success of the local team. A major event in
2 A related empirical literature focuses on indirect network effects, such as Gandal, Kende & Rob (2000), Saloner &
Shepard (1995) and Ackerberg & Gowrisankaran (2006). Consistent with the theoretical literature on network effects,
these papers focus on technology adoption rather than pricing by an intermediary.

our data set is the labor strike in Major League Baseball in 1994, which hurt the popularity of the league
and of collecting baseball cards.
Sports card conventions provide short events for dealers and consumers to come together. While a
number of dealers establish retail shops, many dealers trade entirely at conventions. A small convention
may last one day and consist of 10 tables set up at a mall. The largest conventions have more than
250 tables, last a week, and take over a large convention center in a major city. Convention organizers
rent the location, advertise the convention and charge fees to dealers and consumers. Conventions
sometimes contract for the appearance of professional athletes who will provide signatures for free.
Organizers primarily profit from the entrance fees, although some organizers are also dealers who will
trade cards at the convention. Both the organizer and dealer markets are extremely unconcentrated and
are characterized by many small participants, many of whom have separate full-time jobs unrelated to
sports cards.
Pricing at conventions is very simple. Consumers and dealers pay a fixed fee to the convention
organizer. Typically, consumers pay less than $2, with about half of the conventions in our data set
offering free admission. Dealers pay the “table fee”, typically $25 to $100. The table fee allows the
dealer to set up a table at the convention. Prices at multi-day events may be more complicated, with
prices varying by day (for instance, weekend prices are typically higher) or with lower per-day fees for
admission over multiple days. Also, we observe some discounts from the table fee for purchasing multiple
tables.3
Our data set is based on the trade magazine Becket Baseball Card Monthly. This magazine provides
articles on baseball and collecting, market prices for a huge number of cards, and most importantly for
our purpose, listings for sports card conventions (the “Convention Calendar”). Listing is free and, as we
understand it, every convention would be sure to place a listing in this magazine. The magazine requires
that listed conventions have at least 10 tables, although this does not appear to be binding (see below).
Each calendar covers the month of the issue, so the October 1997 issue has listings for all conventions in
that October.
Our data set consists of the convention listings from a selection of issues of this magazine. Convention
organizers fill out a standard form and listings follow a uniform pattern, which is amenable to computer
interpretation. To create our data set, we scanned all of the listings and used an Optimal Character
Recognition (OCR) program (in particular ABBYY PDF Transformer 1.0) to convert these scans to text
files. Then we wrote computer programs to parse the results into a usable data set. To ensure data
quality, we compared the original copy with each parsed listing and corrected errors by hand.
3 In practice, dealers can buy from consumers and dealers can trade with other dealers, as can consumers with other
consumers. Hence, the important distinction is not who buys cards and who sells cards but who pays the table fee and
who pays the consumer fee. There could be substitution between entering with a table and not doing so. Such substitution
could be problematic for our theoretical predictions since it does appear in existing theoretical work, but should bias our
results away from finding the differences between the two sides that we show.

Each convention lists the city or town in which it occurs. We match these towns to a list of towns
from the U.S. Census and assign the longitude and latitude of the town to the convention. Hence, we
assume that each convention is located in the population center of the town in which it occurs.4 We
drop conventions that do not occur in the continental United States. We dropped some listings that did
not provide town names that we could reliably match to a location in the census. Altogether, we have
data on 50,450 conventions in 36 months over 9 years.
For each listing, we use the dates of the convention, the town and state, the number of tables, the
admission fee for consumers and the table fee for dealers.5 For prices, we always took the price for a
single day of admission if there were discounts for multi-day admission. We used the simple average of
prices if there were different prices for different days. We took the price for a single table if there were
discounts for multiple tables.
Our selection of magazines range from April, 1989 to December, 1997, for a total of 36 issues. As the
magazines are drawn from a personal collection, it is not a continuous set of magazines.6 We purposely
stopped collecting data after 1997, which coincides with the popularity of the World Wide Web. There
is a significant decline in the number of conventions during the late 1990s which makes our approach
difficult since we rely on the presence of competition to create our tests.7 Table 1 lists the issues of the
magazine in the data set, along with the number of conventions in each issue. Figure 1 graphs this series.
There is a peak in activity in the Summer and Fall of 1992 when there are regularly more than 2000
conventions in a month. There is a steady decline afterwards, presumably due to the baseball strike in
1994 and the popularity of the Internet. In 1997, there are less than 1000 conventions per month.
We are interested in oligopoly interactions, so it is useful to get a sense of the number of conventions
in any given region. Table 1 provides the mean number of conventions per 3-digit zip code by month for
zip codes that have at least one convention. The overall average is 3.15, and this ranges from 1.90 to
4.35 in months with low and high activity. Not surprisingly, the distribution underlying these means is
highly skewed. Table 2 displays the number of 3-digit zip code-months with each count of the number
of conventions. For instance, there are 6,886 zip code-months in which we observe only 1 convention in
4 The

listings provide addresses which in principle could be used to more accurately identify locations. However, many
addresses are descriptive (“VFW Hall” or “Westgate Mall”) and therefore are difficult to geocode. Even for the entries
that provide a street address, cleaning them would be an enormous task.
5 We discarded some information: the exact location, the times of day of each convention and the contact name and
number. The contact names are potentially very interesting but difficult to clean reliably.
6 Our collection of magazines is drawn from those we found for sale at several conventions, and some contributions from
John List (for which we are very grateful). We made a number of attempts to find missing issues, for instance at public
libraries. We believe that our selection of magazines is random.
7 The impact of the Web on the convention market represents an interesting topic in its own right, as in Goldmanis,
Hortascu, Syverson & Emre (2010) for booksellers and travel agents. Jin & Kato (2007) present a detailed study on the
online and offline trading of sports cards. Here we shy away from the post-Internet months because it would be difficult to
determine the channel by which the Web affects conventions. Not only does the Web represent an alternative method for
trading cards, the Web represents an alternative leisure activity which substitutes for card collecting altogether.

a month, which represents 43.04 percent of the data. Zip code-months with three or less conventions
represent almost 75% of the data, and 10 or less represents 95% of the data. There is a tail of observations
with a large number of conventions, the maximum being 49 conventions in a 3 digit zip code in a single
month.
The number of tables at a convention is an important explanatory variable for price. We treat the
number of tables as an exogenous measure of the quality of the convention. Clearly, the quantity of
dealers that purchase a table at the convention may be endogenous to the price of a table. However, the
“number of tables” listed in the calendar is determined well before the final count of how many dealers
will appear. We regard the posted number as “cheap talk” that serves to inform readers of the expected
size of the event. Consider that the “number of tables” variable falls disproportionately on multiples of 5
(like 10, 15, 20 etc.), unlike a true measure of quantity. The variable is also highly correlated with other
measures of quality, such as the number and quality of athletes that will be available to sign autographs.8
Thus, we interpret the number of tables to capture in reduced form both the effect of the number of
tables and the effect of other correlated quality variables. As the number of tables is not verified by
our data source, organizers could choose it in a misleading way. Our approach assumes the extent of
misrepresentation does not vary systematically with competition.
Table 3 describes the distribution of the number of tables. The mean is 41.6 and the median is 35.
8 We

do not observe other measures of quality. However, some conventions take out display advertisements in the
calendar section, and from these it is clear that larger conventions offer extra features such as autograph sessions with
athletes, door prizes and free raffles.

Table 4: Distribution of table fee
The distribution is approximately log normal. The 99th percentile is 160. The magazine states that
conventions have at least 10 tables to be listed but this does not appear to be binding. A number of
conventions list less than 10 tables and the number of conventions listing 10 is not large compared to
surrounding numbers. For instance, 589 conventions list 10 tables and 1,502 list 15, and 4,212 list 20.
We find missing listings or listing of 0 number of tables at 1,853 observations and drop these in our
statistical work.
Most conventions, 77.1%, last only one day. Almost all (98.8%) last three days or less. Most take
place on weekends. In our data, 49% cover a Saturday, 53.7% cover a Sunday, and 81% cover Saturday
or Sunday.
The dependent variables in our empirical work are the prices. Table 4 displays the distribution of
the table fee. The mean is $43.7 and the median is $35. The distribution is approximately log normal,
with a long tail of expensive conventions. The 99th percentile is $165 but we observe a few with table
fees greater than $1000.
A striking feature of the distribution of the admission fee is that 52.9% of conventions feature free
admission. A further 29.6% charge a fee of $1. There is little further variation, with much of it falling
on multiples of 50 cents. The 95th percentile is $2. These features lead us to model the admission fee
as a binary variable so we simply predict whether admission is free or not. With more than 80% of the
observations choosing 0 or 1, this seems like a decent approximation. Figure 2 graphs the distribution
of admission fees in a histogram.

Table 5: Average number of competitors by distance
We compute the number of competitors that a convention faces by counting the number of conventions within a given range of time and geographic distance. For example, we calculate the number of
conventions on the same day within 25 miles. To do so, we use any competing convention that has at least
one day that overlaps with the convention in question. As stated above, we calculate distance based on
the latitude and longitude of the relevant towns in the U.S. Census. Table 5 provides the average number
of competitors by different distances. Note that when computing the “within three days” variable, we
treat the observation as missing for any convention for which we do not have data on conventions within
three days. So for instance, a convention on April 30, 1989 would be problematic since we do not have
the May, 1989 issue so we cannot count all conventions within three days. Hence, Table 5 displays a
lower number of observations for the “within three days” row than the “same day” row. Given that the
great majority of conventions appear on the weekends, we interpret “within three days” as essentially
meaning “same weekend”. Because of these small numbers and the very local nature of the organizing
market, we expect organizers to know with some accuracy in advance the number of conventions they
will face on any given day. Hence, prices respond to competition although prices and competition are
announced publicly at the same time.
A final element of our data set is our contact with card convention organizers. We interviewed several

10

convention organizers via e-mail. Their answers were similar and were sufficient to get a sense of how our
issues were regarded by industry participants. Our questions were focused on the nature of competition
between conventions, as well as competition with other sources of memorabilia. We asked about strategies
that organizers used to maintain successful conventions and we were particularly interested in whether
consumers and dealers were likely to be attending multiple conventions. The basic results were consistent
with how we characterize the theoretical models of the market. Dealers are likely to travel further (have
lower travel costs) than consumers. For a dealer, 100 miles was feasible but more than 200 miles of travel
was unlikely. Larger dealers might attend multiple conventions in the same weekend, but would probably
not be willing to do so if it meant long travel times. Also, our participants regard the Becket magazine
as a very reliable data source.

Empirics

In this section, we present a series of regressions that further explore this data set. In the next section,
we interpret the results from the perspective of the theory of two-sided markets.
In addition to considering issues of two-sided markets, we must also address econometric issues of
unobserved heterogeneity and omitted variable bias. These issues are important when we consider the
relationship between pricing and competition. Demand factors are not entirely observable, and we expect
that high unobservable demand will lead both to high prices and to more entry, which creates bias in
our estimates. We address this issue by including location fixed effects, where locations are indicated by
3-digit zip codes.
To see how our strategy works, we start with regressions of price on nearby competition. These
regressions do not address any issues raised by two-sided markets but rather serve to verify that our
fixed effects strategy works appropriately. Results appear in Table 6. In the first two columns, we have
results from a linear probability model predicting when admission fees are not zero, as a function of the
number of nearby competitors.
We do not include location fixed effects in the first two columns. We do however include time fixed
effects, at the level of the month, and controls for the days of the week.9 We include time fixed effects
and day-of-the-week controls in all specifications in this paper, although we do not report their effects.
We include one control variable in all of the regressions: the log of the number of tables. We interpret
9 Our

controls for the days of the week consist of dummy variables for each combination of days that appear in our
data set more than 500 times. For instance, there is a dummy variable for Saturday-only conventions, one for Sunday-only
conventions, and a separate dummy for conventions on both Saturday and Sunday. The full set of dummy variables capture
97% of the data set. We also include the duration of the convention (1, 2 or 3 days), which serves to better match the
remaining 3% of conventions. We do not report any of these results in the paper. In all regressions, we reduce heterogeneity
by dropping conventions that last more than three days, although we still use them for purposes of computing the number
of competitors.

11

this variable as a control for the quality of the convention and, not surprisingly, it is positive and both
economically and statistically significant in every specification.
In column 1 of Table 6, we define competition to be the log of the number of competitors within 25
miles, and in column 2 we use 50 miles. We add one to the number of competitors to address log zero
issues. In both cases, we see that competition is positive and statistically significant, as if competition
caused higher prices. However, this result appears to be driven by unobserved geographic heterogeneity.
In columns 3 and 4, we include location fixed effects. In this specification, we see that competition has
a negative effect on the likelihood of setting a non-zero admission fee and that this effect is significantly
different from zero at a confidence level of 1%. Our results are robust to using Chamberlain’s conditional
logit model (Chamberlain, 1980) to predict the probability of using a positive admission fee with location
fixed effects. We conclude from this regression that our measure of competition and our fixed effects
strategy addresses the omitted variable problem, at least in part.
We see similar results when we use the log of the table fee as the dependent variable. We use a linear
model for the log of the table fee and estimate with linear panel data techniques. In the first two columns
of the second panel in Table 6, we present results without location fixed effects. In these cases, the effect
of competition on price is estimated to be statistically insignificant, and is very close to zero. However,
the next two columns include location fixed effects, and here we see that competition has a negative and
statistically significant effect for distances of both 25 and 50 miles. The effect is not large – the elasticity
is around -0.02. But we believe this to be an upper bound due to the positive correlation induced by
remaining unobserved heterogeneity.10
Note that the number of observations is slightly lower when we use the table fee because the table
fee is missing for a number of observations. Restricting the admissions fee regressions to observations in
which the table fee is present does not change results. For both admission fee and table fee regressions
with fixed effects, some observations are dropped because the dependent variable does not vary within a
zip code.
The focus of our interest is on the asymmetric effect of competition on the two sides of the market.
To the extent that distance affects consumers and dealers differently, we capture the asymmetry by
distinguishing between “near competition” and “far competition.” We define near to be those conventions
within 25 or 50 miles, and far to be those within 100 or 150 miles, not including near competitors. Again,
we require all competitors to overlap in calendar time by at least one day.
We report the results of near and far competition in Table 7. In the first panel, we see that for all
definitions of distance, an increase in both near and far competition makes free admission more likely.
All effects are significant at 1% confidence levels.
In the second panel, we see that near competition also drives down table fees, and does so with effects
similar to what we found in Table 6. However, far competition measured within a 100 mile radius has

that the negative coefficient on dealer prices is not predicted by the theory of two-sided markets, but we show
below that it is explained by the conventions that do not charge admission, consistent with theory.

Notes: All columns use linear models. Location fixed effects are 3 digit zip codes. All models include fixed effects for time (monthly) and
days-of-the-week the convention covers. Competition is the number of conventions within the "Mileage" number that overlap in the
calendar (plus 1 to address log zero).

Table 6: Regressions with and without location fixed effects
no significant effect on table fees, and far competition measured within 150 miles has a positive effect on
prices. The key feature of our empirical result is the pairing of the negative coefficient on one side of the
market with the zero or positive coefficient on the other side.
Obviously, a positive effect of competition or even a zero effect is hard to explain with standard
models. We argue below that it is consistent with a reasonable model of two-sided markets. An alternative
explanation for the positive coefficient on far competition is that it is due to endogenous entry, so that
unobserved temporal-geographic heterogeneity causes this result. However, this idea is hard to formulate
because we include time and location fixed effects and because we find a negative coefficient on nearby
competition. While it is plausible that there is heterogeneity that varies over time and space jointly, it
must also somehow operate in a wider area more strongly than a local area, and affect the two sides of
the market in an asymmetric way.

We also study whether conventions constrained that allow free admission to consumers set dealer
prices differently in response to competition than conventions that charge admissions. For these purposes, we additionally project dealer price onto a dummy variable for whether the convention offers free
admission, and importantly, the interaction of the dummy with the log of nearby competition. We interpret conventions that allow free admission to be price-constrained. Presumably these conventions would
not reduce their fee in response to small changes in exogenous variables. There is a sense in which every
convention is constrained as they tend to use round numbers for the admission fee so it does not appear
to be a truly continuous choice variable. However, we view the conventions with free admission as the
“most constrained” conventions: they would be least likely to adjust their admission fee in response to
changes in market variables. In theory, conventions could use raffle tickets or door prizes to implement
a sort of negative price, but these should be inefficient instruments to pay consumers relative to actual
price, so we still view conventions with free admission as price constrained. We discuss the theoretical
treatment of price constraints in the next section, but as we argue, the theoretical models do not depend
on competition affecting one side more than the other, which is why we focus the interaction term on
“near” competition, which affects both sides of the market.
Results appear in the third panel of Table 7. In these columns, the coefficient on nearby competition
becomes insignificant and precisely estimated near zero. Instead, we see a negative and significant
coefficient on the interaction term, with a substantially higher magnitude than we found on nearby
competition in panel 2. That is, the negative effect of nearby competition that we observed earlier
appears to be coming from the constrained firms. Thus, constrained firms respond more strongly to
competition than unconstrained firms.11 As before, we see no effect of far competition when measured
at 100 miles and a positive and significant effect at 150 miles.
These set of results motivate us to try a final, more ambitious regression that captures our “entire
story” in a single regression. We predict table fees with separate variables to control for near competition
(less than 50 miles), far competition (50-100 miles), very far competition (100-250 miles) and out-of-range
competition (250-400 miles). We also interact near competition with a dummy for free admission. Results
for the table fee appear in Column 1 of Table 8. Results are largely consistent with our earlier findings.
We find no effect of competition more than 250 miles away, which we interpret as being too far to be in
the relevant market. We find a positive effect on competition for the 100-250 mile range, and we find
competition has no effect on dealer prices in the 50-100 mile range. We find a negative effect in the
nearby range (less than 50 miles) for conventions that do not charge admission. Unlike in the previous
regression, we find that competition within 50 miles has a negative effect even for conventions that charge
admission.
For our story to be complete, we should also find that the effect of competition on admission fees
is negative over the 0-250 mile range and zero outside of that range. Column 2 of Table 8 estimates
11 Note

that both admission and table fees are determined simultaneously so there is a potential endogeneity problem
with including admission fees on the right-hand side. We discuss this further below.

Note: The first two columns reestimate column 3 of panels 1
and 3 of Table 7, but with four competition distances
instead of two. The third column re‐estimates column 2
with the restriction that the parameters on 50‐100 and 100‐
250 are the same.

Table 8: Results with four competition distances
the linear probability model on admission fee with the same four competition variables as we used for
the table fee. We find significantly negative coefficients for 0-50 and 50-100. However, we we find a
zero coefficient for 100-250 and positive coefficient for the 250-400 range. We prefer the specification in
Column 3, in which we restrict the model to have the same coefficient for 50-100 and 100-250. In this
case, we find the expected results of negative coefficients on 0-250 and zero for 250-400.
Note that all results in Tables 6, 7 and 8 are robust to using standard errors that are clustered
at the level of the location-month. The one exception is the surprising positive coefficient on the 250400 range in Column 2 in Table 8. Under clustering, this coefficient is not significantly different from
zero, which conforms to our expectations for this coefficient. One issue that clustering addresses is that
location-months with many conventions count more in the regression results. Also, all results on sign
and significance in the admission fee regressions are robust to switching to Chamberlain’s conditional
logit model.

Interpretation

The previous section establishes a set of stylized facts drawn from a two-sided market. We find that
competition at any relevant distance decreases consumer admission prices. However, prices for dealers
are more complex. In this section, we argue that set of results is consistent with the theory of two-sided
markets. These theories are very flexible and perhaps could generate a variety of results. However, we
16

argue that the set of assumptions that generate our results are natural for this market.
Among the most widely accepted implications of the theoretical literature on competition in twosided markets is that competition between platforms affects the side that single-homes much more than
the side that multi-homes. For instance, this result appears in Armstrong (2006), Rochet & Tirole
(2003), and Gomes (2011). Assuming that dealers are more likely to multi-home than consumers, that
implies that competition affects consumer prices more than dealer prices. Intuitively, the only way for
dealers to reach consumers is through the convention that the consumer chooses. Hence, the convention
has monopoly power over the dealer for access to its consumers. This makes competition to attract
consumers particularly intense. There is no competition to attract dealers, since multihoming implies
that the decision of dealers is separable across conventions. Thus, an increase in competition among
conventions (for instance, by exogenously moving conventions closer together or by adding one to the
market) creates lower prices for consumers but much less so, or not at all for dealers.12
Interestingly, Armstrong (2006) provides a similar result in the case in which both consumers and
dealers single-home. In that case, increasing competition on one side of the market but not the other
lowers prices on that side, but does not affect prices on the other.13 However, this result is driven by
the assumption that both sides of the market are fully served by the conventions. Thus, there is no
market-expansion effect to lower prices.
To capture a more realistic case in which some agents choose not to attend either convention, we
present a formal theoretical model in the appendix. In our model, consumers and dealers are distributed
uniformly on separate “Hotelling” lines. Two conventions have separate locations on each line. The
conventions are not at the end points of the lines. Rather, the lines extend far enough past the conventions
in both directions that there is always a market expansion effect to lower prices. Conventions choose
fees simultaneously, separately setting both a consumer and dealer admission fee. Then, consumers and
dealers simultaneously decide which convention to attend, accounting for their travel costs, the fees,
and the number of agents on the other side. We consider parameters such that in equilibrium, agents
between the conventions are fully served whereas some agents on the sides choose not to participate.
Thus, our model extends Armstrong (2006) to allow for a market expansion effect. While the model does
not generate easily interpretable equations, numeric solutions replicate all of the theoretical results that
we discuss for both single-homing and multi-homing dealers.
Our presentation in the appendix focuses on the case in which single-homing consumers and dealers
since this generates a striking result does not appear in the preceding theoretical literature: An increase
12 Existing

theoretical work on platform competition considers cases with only two conventions, and studies changes in
competition by varying the distance between them. Naturally, our empirical specification is designed to handle much more
varied market structures. We interpret an increase in the number of competing conventions as the theoretical equivalent
of moving a platform from a really far distance that has a minimal competitive effect (say more than 300 miles away) to a
distance that counts for near or far competition.
13 For example, see Equation 12 in Armstrong (2006).

17

in competition for consumers leads to lower prices for consumers and higher prices for dealers. Intuitively,
as competition increases for consumers, the number of consumers served decreases for each convention.
Since part of the value of attracting dealers is that it allows the convention to raise price to consumers,
dealers become less valuable as the number of consumers goes down. The decreased marginal benefit of
attracting a dealer causes the conventions to raise the price to dealers. This effect was masked in the
model of Armstrong, which assumed that quantity stayed constant on both sides (via the “fully served”
assumption).14 In our model, the only difference between consumers and dealers is that consumers have
higher travel costs.
Thus, our basic empirical result that competition causes prices to fall for consumers but to remain
unchanged or increase for dealers can be rationalized by the theory of two-sided markets. In fact, we
can say more. Competition does not affect dealer prices in a model in which dealers multi-home and
competition causes prices to increase in a model in which dealers single-home. Thus, our empirical
result that competition between conventions less than 100 miles apart has no effect on dealer price and
competition greater than 100 miles away causes dealer prices to increase is consistent with a model in
which dealers multi-home between conventions at lower distances but single-home at greater distances.
We have no direct data on the extent to which dealers single-home or multi-home. Presumably,
there is a mix of each. It is difficult to say when multi-homing is more prevalent. Certainly, it seems
natural to think that dealers would be more likely to split their collection among two conventions when
the conventions are not very far apart. Furthermore, our interviews with industry participants were
suggestive of our interpretation. They confirm that dealers travel further than consumers, and generally
treat travel as less important. Furthermore, dealers are capable of splitting their collection. One example
where this might come up would be if a dealer regularly appeared at a monthly card show that happened
to overlap with a very large annual show. Without further data, which we do not believe is available,
we cannot further explore this issue, so we simply note that our interpretation of the empirical results is
consistent with a reasonable description of market behavior.
To be clear, there are no theoretical models we know of that endogenize the change from single-homing
to multi-homing – it is always imposed by the model. However, it is straightforward to think about how
this might work. Recall that most dealers are very small businesses. Multi-homing probably means that
the dealer attends one convention and hires an employee or family member to attend another. Whereas
the dealer may regard his own travel costs as very low, paying an employee for time and car usage
may make distant conventions more costly. Alternatively, a dealer may hire employees to go to both
conventions (perhaps for only part of the day) and then the dealer would visit both conventions himself as
well. In either case, we could imagine increasing the distance between conventions endogenously switching
14 One

can see our result in the model of Weyl (2010), which only models the monopoly case but with more general
demand functions than we have here. Weyl shows that the equilibrium price to one side depends on the number of agents
on the other side (see equation 4). If the quantity on the other side goes down, for instance because of competition, so
does the price.

18

the dealer’s preferences from a multi-homing model, where the dealer’s decision at each convention is
independent of the other, to a single-homing model, where the dealer must choose which one of a set of
conventions to attend.
Recall that in Table 8, we found that price responded negatively to competition within 50 miles
even for conventions that charged for admission. This result is not consistent with our story in which
dealers purely multi-home, consumers single-home and agents never substitute between being consumers
and dealers, which would predict no effect of competition on dealer price. However, we do not view
this as particularly troubling. First, we did obtain the result of no significant effect in Table 7, so this
problematic result is not entirely robust. Furthermore, it seems reasonable that at close distance, onesided logic is more powerful than two-sided logic, and leads prices to fall in competition. Perhaps some
dealers substitute to enter as consumers, or some consumers multi-home at short distances, which could
explain this outcome formally.
An additional empirical result is that competition affects price-constrained platforms differently. Armstrong & Wright (2007) study how a constraint on one side affects pricing on the other. Writing in terms
of the sports card application, they show that conventions that choose free admission reduce dealer prices
in response to increases in competition more strongly than do conventions that use positive admission
fees. Intuitively, competition induces firms to set lower consumer fees. When consumer fees reach zero,
conventions must find another method to attract consumers as competition increases, and so conventions turn towards attracting dealers. Thus, pricing to dealers is more aggressive in competition when
consumer prices are constrained.15
Gomes (2011) also finds that competition has a bigger effect on seller prices when the platform cannot
price to consumers, with similar intuition. His approach is notable because he uses a mechanism design
approach, and so in this sense considers very general pricing functions.16
A potential issue in the empirical model is that admissions and dealer prices are set simultaneously.
However, the theoretical relationship between the two prices can be interpreted as an equilibrium correlation rather than a causal effect. That is, in Armstrong & Wright (2007), competition is the exogenous
variable. As competition increases, consumer prices drop until they hit their boundary, at which point
dealer prices fall. Thus, our regressions are consistent with the theory in this sense. There may still be
15 Armstrong & Wright (2007) make this point in the context of their model in which agents are fully served by conventions.
We have confirmed these predictions in our model which allows for a market expansion effect. Also, they generate asymmetry
by allowing the “network effect” parameters (what we label α in the appendix) to differ across consumers and dealers. We
have confirmed these results allowing for heterogeneity in the other parameters, such as the travel cost (t) and stand-alone
utility (v). We also have checked these results when dealers single-home and multi-home. Results are available on request.
16 Gomes (2011) is motivated by Internet search auctions but the model is still relevant for our context. In considering
implementation, Gomes focuses on a platform that auctions access to users. In his model, the platform sets the weight it
will put on the seller’s bid relative to the quality the seller will provide to the consumers. While Gomes does not study
price explicitly, raising the weight on the bid causes sellers to bid more aggressively, which is analogous to raising price in
our setting. He finds that the auction is not affected by competition between platforms when the platform can subsidize
consumers, but that the weight on the bid goes down in competition when pricing to consumers is constrained.

19

more standard empirical problems to worry about. For instance, unobserved location heterogeneity could
lead to low consumer and dealer prices and high competition, which would generate our empirical result.
We find this possibility unlikely – standard intuition suggests that unobserved heterogeneity generates a
positive correlation between prices and entry, not negative.
Overall, theory provides a consistent interpretation of our regression results. Dealers multi-home
and so competition between conventions has no effect on dealer prices over some middle range. When
conventions are very close, admission fees are driven to zero and then conventions compete by lowering
dealer fees. When conventions are far from each other, dealers switch to single-homing, in which case
dealer prices increase in competition, since competition for consumers is more intense than competition
for dealers.
Clearly, we have not established that the theory of two-sided markets is the only theory that could
generate these results, but we believe that it is difficult to find an alternative, particularly for the result
about increased prices. There are a variety of ways that someone might model this market but without
specifying an explicit model, it is surely true that most multi-product oligopoly models predict that
prices fall in competition, rather than increase. Our empirics do not provide a test of two-sided market
theories in the sense of developing falsifiable predictions from the theory of two-sided markets. Rather,
our goal is to provide a set of stylized facts from the industry and argue that they can be rationalized
with these theories.
A theory that generates prices that increase in competition exists for prescription drugs, in which
we have seen brand-name drugs raise prices after entry by a generic drug (for instance, see Ching,
2010). These models rely on the entrant successfully capturing the high elasticity customers, leaving
the incumbent to exploit the remaining low elasticity customers, where elasticity is driven by the type
of insurance that a consumer has. That kind of differentiation between platforms and heterogeneity in
elasticity seems unlikely to be relevant for the card convention market.

Conclusion

We provide a set of empirical results drawn from a new data set on sports card conventions in the U.S. in
the mid-1990s. These conventions are a two-sided market since convention organizers must set admission
and table fees to attract consumers and dealers. This setting is compelling for the study of two-sided
markets because we observe many, many conventions and thus variation in market structure, and the
pricing setting is simple and easily interpretable.
We show that consumer prices respond to the number of conventions both nearby and far. In contrast,
dealer prices at conventions within 100 miles do not respond to competition between conventions, except
for a negative effect for conventions that do not charge admission. Also, competition that is more than
100 miles away (when dealer single-homing is likely) causes prices to increase. We argue that this set of

20

results is consistent with the existing theories of two-sided markets. Thus, we find that empirical evidence
from the sports cards market supports the recent theoretical literature on two-sided markets. Existing
theoretical work considers no more than two competing conventions, whereas our empirical setting is
much more varied. Therefore, our results suggest that intuition obtained in a duopoly market structure
can be extended to more complicated market structures.

Appendix: An illustrative model of sports card conventions

Competition among sports card conventions can be summarized as the number of competitors that a
convention faces in the same time frame within a specific distance. However solving a theoretical model
that allows for variation in both the number of platforms and distance between platforms is a challenge.
Like the existing theoretical literature on two-sided markets, we restrict our model to have two platforms
and and we use the distance between platforms to proxy for the level competition. In Section 4 , we
explain how we interpret predictions from this model in the context of sports card conventions. See
footnote 12 as well.
We base our work closely on the model of Armstrong (2006). This model is useful for representing the
sports card convention market because it address competition between two platforms that charge only a
fixed fee to each agent and do not charge based on the number of trades made through the platform. We
extend this model to allow for a market expansion effect from lowering prices. While doing so complicates
the model, it also provides more realistic results to take to data.
Consider two sides of a market, with one set of agents on each side. Side C is made up of consumers
and side D is make up of dealers. We index sides by m. Consumers and dealers are distributed along
separate real number lines with density one. They are distributed across the entire line.17 Agent i in
market m is located at li (we do not index li by market for notational convenience). Consumer i bears
no relationship with dealer i in side D. That is, they make their choices independently. There are two
conventions, or “platforms”, 1 and 2, indexed by j. Throughout, we assume that platforms have no
costs. The platforms sell to consumers and dealers simultaneously. The location of platform j in side m
is ljm . In this set-up, we can consider comparative static in ljC but not ljD , as if a platform could change
its location with respect to consumers but not dealers. Clearly, this is an abstraction since an actual
change in geographic location would affect all types of agents, but we think of this is an approximation
to a situation in which one set of agents cares about location much more than the other. Alternatively,
one may assume conventions have the same location on each side of the market (that is, ljC = ljD ) but
with consumers having higher travel costs than dealers (tC > tD ). We solve this alternative model and
find the same qualitative results, although the equations are much more complicated and we must resort
to numerical analysis to a greater degree. For this reason, we only present the model that assumes equal
travel cost but allows platforms to change locations on the two sides asymmetrically.
Agents value a platform based on how many agents the platform serves in the other side. Suppose
D
m
platform j sells to nC
j consumers and nj dealers. The utility to agent i in side m is uij , defined to be:
D
C
C
uC
ij = v + αnj − pj − t|li − lj |
C
D
D
uD
ij = v + αnj − pj − t|li − lj |

where v represents the stand-alone utility of purchase to consumers and dealers, α determines the value
conferred by sales in the other side of the market, pm
j is the price of platform j in side m, and t
parameterizes the travel cost. We assume that agents could instead use some outside good with utility
of zero. Figure 3 displays our model visually.
Note that we are treating dealers symmetrically with consumers. We do not model price-setting,
competition or other externalities between dealers. Doing so would complicate our analysis unnecessarily.
Wright (2010) presents a model with within-group competition that turns out to be just a change of
17 The important assumption is not that agents extend forever across each line but that they extend past whatever
location would generate sales for zero prices, so there is always a demand expansion effect to lower prices.

variables from the model we consider. Also, we assume there is agent heterogeneity in li but not α. Weyl
(2010) explores a model with heterogeneity in both terms but we have not done so as we believe that
geographic heterogeneity is the most important issue in our application.
Throughout, we parameterize the model as follows, which we regard as without loss of generality:
Assumption 1

l1C = −1

l1D = −1

l2D = 1

t = 1.

We want to consider comparative statics of prices in l2C . An alternative would be to allow t to be heterogeneous across markets and consider comparative statics in consumer t. However, note that reductions
in t bring conventions closer together and increase the responsiveness to the number of agents on the
other side, like increasing α. We wish to isolate the competitive effect, and so focus on l2C .
We assume that the two platforms choose prices simultaneously and we solve for a Nash equilibrium
of the game. Platforms are symmetric and we find only symmetric equilibria. Hence, we always find that
P1m = P2m for m = {C, D}.
We consider the case in which consumers and dealers both single-home. That is, agents pick the
single platform that gives the highest utility, or choose no platform if the value of purchase does not
exceed their reservation value of zero.
We are interested in cases in which there is a strategic interaction between the two platforms, so we
consider cases in which all consumers located between the two platforms prefer purchasing from either
platform to no purchase. Armstrong (2006) obtains simple analytic solutions to a similar model in which
agents are assumed to be on finite lines and platforms are at the ends of these lines. However, the lack
of a demand expansion effect leads to some unrealistic implications. The principal innovation of our
model is to incorporate a demand expansion effect by allowing agents to be located on both sides of the
platforms. While our solutions are less elegant, they are more relevant for our empirical work.

where n−m
−j refers to the number of agents purchasing the other platform’s product in the other side. The
first two terms refer to the profit drawn from agents between the two platforms. The first term will be

zero in a symmetric equilibrium and the second term increases as the platforms become farther apart.
The last term captures the profits drawn from agents on the other sides of the platforms.
We take first-order conditions from the profit functions for each price and we solve for prices by
solving the four first-order conditions simultaneously.18 Algebraic manipulation shows that:

This result implies that pD
1 decreases as platform 2 becomes farther away on side C, if the network
effect is not too large.19 That is, higher competition on one side increases prices in the other. We consider
the finding that prices increase in competition to be very surprising. It would be difficult to replicate in
a model with only single-sided interaction.
The condition that the network effect be not too large turns out to be non-binding. As is well-known
in the network effects literature, large network effects lead to intense price competition. There exists a
critical value of α such that prices become zero. It takes on a particularly simple form in our model:
when l2C = 1, prices are greater than zero if α < 1/2. Obviously, this lies below 5/8. Hence, we would
C
never consider values of α such that dpD
1 /dl2 > 0.
To get a sense of the whole set of prices, consider the specification with v = 1 and α = 0.3. These
parameters imply that for l2C = 1, all consumers and dealers between the platforms purchase. Then,
prices are:
C
pC
1 = 0.27 + 0.19l2

C
pD
1 = 0.49 − 0.03l2

C
pC
2 = 0.27 + 0.19l2

C
pD
2 = 0.49 − 0.03l2

Not surprisingly, platform 1 increases its price to consumers as platform 2 becomes farther away on that
side. However, we also see that platform 1 decreases its price to dealers as platform 2 becomes farther
away on the consumer side.
What is the intuition for this surprising result? As platforms become closer together, they serve fewer
consumers. Thus dealers, who are attractive in part because they allow the platform to raise price on
consumers, are less attractive. Hence, platforms raise price to dealers. Note that this result is unique
to our setting because we have a demand expansion effect. Armstrong (2006) finds that changing the
distance between platforms on one side does not affect prices on the other. This follows from Armstrong’s
assumption that consumers are fully served.
As noted in footnote 15, we have also solved versions of our model when assuming that dealers can
multi-home, and when v, α or t differ for consumers and dealers, inducing platforms to set a price of zero
to one side. As these results are consistent with existing theory, we do not present them here, although
they are available upon request.

19 It turns out that this condition also implies that all agents between the two platforms are served as long as v is high
enough, in particular v > 7/6. For lower values of v, we require α to be above some low value, but this requirement could
be eliminated by lowering t.
