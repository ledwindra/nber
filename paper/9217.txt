The Time Series of the Cross Section of Asset Prices

ABSTRACT

In this paper we propose a general equilibrium model that successfully reproduces the
historical experience of the cross section of US stock prices as well as the realized history of the
market portfolio. The model achieves this while addressing traditional concerns in the asset pricing
literature: A high equity premium and volatility of returns, the long horizon predictability, and a low
volatility of the risk free rate. The model combines a rich payoff structure with a habit persistence
discount factor, which allows us to identify the effect on prices of idiosyncratic cash flow shocks
versus business cycle components.

I. INTRODUCTION
What are the sources of differences across asset prices? How does the cross section
of stock prices behave over the business cycle? Do prices show secular trends and, if so,
what is the source of this trend? Asset prices are the result of the interaction of cash flows
with the stochastic discount factor and, consequently, answers to these questions rest on a
thorough understanding of each of these two components. Surprisingly though, there has been
little theoretical work combining a rich payoff structure with an interesting pricing kernel in a
general equilibrium framework, and, hence, these issues have not been successfully addressed
in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to fill this void. Specifically, we write a general
equilibrium model that tightly links the cross section and the time series of asset prices to cash
flows and a consumption based stochastic discount factor. The model successfully reproduces
the historical experience of the cross section of US stock prices as well as the realized history
of the market portfolio. In addition, our set up is able to address traditional concerns in the
asset pricing literature: A high equity premium and volatility of returns, the long horizon
predictability, and a low volatility of the risk free rate.
To gain some insight on the interaction between cash flows and stochastic discount
factors, Figure 1 shows evidence on the relation between the cross section of asset prices and
the business cycle. Panel A shows the log of the price dividend ratio of the market portfolio
versus the cross sectional standard deviation of the log price dividend ratios of industry-sorted
portfolios for the sample period 1927-2001. Both series show a great deal of comovement and
indeed their correlation is a solid .75. As it is well known variation in the price dividend ratio of
the market portfolio is mostly driven by shocks to expected rates of return, an aggregate effect.
The high correlation between these two series then suggests a link between the aggregate factors
driving the time series variation of the market portfolio and the cross sectional dispersion across
industries. Moreover, Panel B, where we plot the same series in first differences, shows that
the same pattern holds for higher frequencies. Once again both series show a great deal of
comovement and their correlation coefficient is still a healthy .40.
Clearly, price dividend ratio fluctuations can only be driven by news to cash flows and
news to discount rates, so whatever variation there is in the cross section of these ratios must
be driven by differences on how each industry loads in either one of these two components.
We can then apply the traditional tools of variance decomposition literature to deepen our
1

understanding of the driving forces behind the time variation in the cross sectional dispersion.
Table I Panel A reports the percentage of the variance of log price dividend ratio that is
driven by shocks to expected cash flows versus shocks to expected returns for two industries
in our sample, Railroads and Paper. For comparison we include the more standard variance
decomposition for the market portfolio.1 Paper and Railroads differ markedly. For example,
while Paper is similar to the market portfolio, as shocks to discount rates make up the largest
component of the variance of its log price-dividend ratio, this is not true for Railroads, where
the cash flow component seems to have a bigger role (although statistically insignificant). A
similar exercise across industries reveals that for some industries the variance of log pricedividend ratios is driven to a large extent by cash flow news whereas for others they explain a
much smaller fraction of this variance.
Table I Panel B reports the same result from the perspective of standard five year ahead
predictability regressions. Price dividend ratios predict future returns in the case of Paper, very
much like (or even better than) the well known predictability result for the market portfolio,
whereas they do not in the case of Railroads.
The variance decomposition and predictability regressions are ideal instruments to analyze what drives the price dividend ratios of various industries and summarize their cross
sectional differences conveniently, but we are interested in another aspect of the data as well,
namely, the level and trend of asset prices. To illustrate this Figure 2 plots the price of Railroads and Paper, normalized both by the level of US consumption. For comparison, we have
included the price consumption ratio of the market portfolio. The pattern is striking: while
Railroads has experienced a severe secular decline, Paper experienced a surge in the mid fifties
and has remained roughly steady ever since. These two industries differ only in their cash flow
realizations and we are interested in finding out how far can these cash flows go in rationalizing
the observed histories.
Our model will be able to shed light on the cross-sectional differences in predictability
1

The voluminous literature on the variance decomposition starts with Campbell and Shiller’s (1988a,b)

seminal contribution. See also Cochrane (1991). The general finding is that the cash flow component does not
explain much of the variation of the log price-dividend ratio of the market portfolio, while the return component
explains a larger percentage of it. Vuoltenahoo (2002) conducts the same exercise at the firm level, finding that,
in contrast to the market portfolio, individual stock returns are mainly driven by news to cash flows. Ours is
the same exercise at an intermediate level of aggregation.

and variance decomposition, and, in the process, account for the diverse historical experiences
of the industries in our data set. Specifically, we write an economy with a representative agent
whose preferences are the log version of the habit persistence model of Campbell and Cochrane
(1999). As these authors have shown, these preferences induce fluctuations in the stochastic
discount factor that can successfully explain the main patterns of aggregate market data.2
The novel aspect of this paper is the model of cash flow we introduce, a necessary ingredient if prices are the object of interest.3 In our set up the representative consumer can
trade multiple dividend paying assets. Rather than modeling the level of dividends themselves,
we specify processes for the fraction that each asset contributes to total consumption. These
processes are stationary and bounded between zero and one. This modeling device then naturally induces dividend series that add to a consumption process that is consistent with the
observed behavior of the US time series.4 Moreover the framework, while rich in implications,
is tractable enough to yield pricing formulas that are interpretable and that are directly linked
to fundamentals.
In particular, we find that asset prices are given by a linear function of a stochastic
trend in dividends plus a second term that reflects deviations from this trend. The loadings
on the stochastic trend and the actual dividends vary with the business cycle, as they increase
2

The literature on habit persistence and asset pricing is large and includes, in addition to Campbell and

Cochrane (1999), Sundaresan (1989), Constantinides (1990), Abel (1990), Ferson and Constantinides (1991),
Detemple and Zapatero (1991), Daniel and Marshall (1997), and Li (2001). The habit persistence literature
though has largely concentrated on the time series properties of the market portfolio rather than on the cross
section, the main focus of the present work. Wachter (2000 and 2001) is an exception as she studies the bond
pricing implications of the habit persistence model of Campbell and Cochrane (1999), effectively pricing bonds
and the the aggregate market portfolio.
3
As mentioned modeling cash flows has elicited very little research. An early reference in this direction is
Bossaerts and Green (1990) who model dividend processes directly. Abel (1999) and Bansal, Dittmar, and
Lundblad (2001) have proposed a consumption leverage model where an asset’s premium is determined by the
extent to which its dividend loads on consumption. None of these papers though attempt to address the time
series variation of the cross section of stock prices‘. Furthermore, these models are not fully fledged general
equilibrium model nor are the cash flow processes defined in such a way as to prevent assets to become irrelevant
as a fraction of total consumption or to account for more than it. Our model is more closely related to the
general equilibrium set up of Brock (1982), though his is a production economy framework.
4
The model is rich enough to accommodate sources of income other than financial. Indeed Santos and
Veronesi (2001) use the technology introduced in this paper to shed light on the connection between labor
income and asset prices.

during peaks and decrease during troughs. Cash flow shocks then have a very different effect
on an asset’s price depending on where the economy is over the business cycle. Conversely,
aggregate shocks affect assets differently depending on whether their current dividends are
above or below the stochastic trend. In addition, prices depend on the covariance between the
share of consumption that the asset commands and consumption growth and once again the
weight of this component depends on where the economy is over the business cycle inducing
an additional source of conditional and unconditional cross sectional variation. We are able
then to offer a complete characterization of the cross section of asset prices as a function of
both aggregate and idiosyncratic cash flow shocks.
In this paper we are interested in the connection between fundamentals and the level of
prices, a distinct information not captured in returns. This can only be done if one specifies
a cash flow model. Because this is the novel contribution of the paper we simply sketch the
implications of our set up for returns. A thorough theoretical and empirical analysis of these
implications can be found in a companion paper. (Menzly, Santos, and Veronesi (2002)).
In order to asses the empirical validity of our setup we need to obtain values for the
different parameters of the model. As in Campbell and Cochrane (1999), we calibrate the
preference parameters to match basic moments of the aggregate market portfolio and the
interest rate. In addition, we use dividend and consumption data from 1927-2001 to estimate
the parameters of the cash-flow model for the industry-sorted portfolios. Importantly, we avoid
the use of any information contained in individual prices or returns to obtain these parameters,
otherwise the assessment of the model’s ability to account for the main empirical properties of
the cross section would be compromised.
We then conduct two sets of experiments. First, we run simulations of our economy. This
will allow us to compute moments for which we have no closed form solutions. In particular,
given that our set up explicitly models cash flows and discount factors, we want to asses
whether our model can account for the predictability of returns across industries as well as the
variance decomposition of their price dividend ratios, as in Table I and Figures 1 and 2. Our
model provides a striking account of these cross sectional differences.
Second, we investigate whether the model can reproduce the observed US financial history. To do so we feed the pricing formulas found in the theoretical section the realized
consumption and cash flow shocks. We show that the model offers a remarkable account of

4

the observed history of the prices of industry portfolios, an account, recall, that is simultaneously consistent with the behavior of the aggregate market. Furthermore, we show as well that
the model naturally generates the positive correlation between the log price dividend ratio of
the market portfolio and the time series of the cross sectional standard deviation of log price
dividend ratios. The model performs well even when both times series are in first differences,
accounting for the historical patterns in Figure 1, Panels A and B.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section II covers the model, which is solved in Sections
III and IV. The model’s calibration is reported in Section V. Section VI evaluates the model.
Section VII ties some loose ends in the model and Section VIII concludes. All proofs are
contained in the Appendix.

where Xt denotes the habit level and φ denotes the subjective discount rate.5
The effect of habit persistence on the agent’s attitudes towards risk can be conveniently
summarized by the surplus consumption ratio, St , defined as:
St =

Ct − Xt
.
Ct

Movements of this surplus directly translate into fluctuations of the local curvature of
the utility function, 1/St . As can readily be checked, a low St is associated with “bad states,”
periods of high risk aversion, whereas a high St corresponds to “good states,” periods of low
5

The idea of habit formation dates back to Duesenberry (1949). Deaton and Muellbauer (1980) provide a

survey and early references. These preferences have been used in a rich variety of contexts. Some applications
include Boldrin, Christiano, and Fisher (2001), Fuhrer (2000), or Lettau and Uhlig (2000) in the RBC literature, Bakshi and Chen (1996) and Carroll, Overland, and Weil (2000) in the growth literature. The asset
pricing applications are many and were briefly cited the previous footnote. These preferences have generated
a remarkable amount of empirical work, for instance, Muellbauer (1988), Heien and Durham (1991), Heaton
(1993), and Dynan (2000).

prices and returns of financial assets.
II.B The cash flow model

There are n risky assets, not all necessarily financial, paying a dividend rate Dti

n
,
i=1

in units of a homogeneous and perishable consumption good. These dividends must add up to
a process that is consistent with the observed time series of US consumption. For this reason,
and in accordance with the empirical evidence, we assume that the process for aggregate
consumption growth can be well approximated as an i.i.d. process:
dCt
= µc dt + σc dBt ,
Ct

(1)

where µc is the mean consumption growth, σc is a 1 × n dimensional vector, and Bt denotes a
n × 1 dimensional standard Brownian Motion vector. Furthermore, without loss of generality
we impose that
σc = (σc,1 , 0, · · · , 0) .
Instead of positing processes for



that add up to the aggregate consumption

process (1), we model the shares of consumption that are generated by each of asset

P
volatility function is chosen in order to guarantee that sit > 0 for i = 1, · · · , n and ni=1 sit = 1
for all t > 0.6
We notice two important features of the diffusion part in process (4): (i ) It is parametrically indeterminate, that is, adding a constant vector, c, to all the vi ’s leaves the share
6

The assumption that the mean reversion speed, κ, is common across shares is made to simplify the pre-

sentation and can be easily generalized. The restriction of a common mean reversion speed though cannot be
rejected in the data set we employ in this paper.

i = 1, .., n − 1 to completely describe the share process. In other words, we can assume vn = 0
without loss of generality.
In what follows, we choose to renormalize the vi ’s, for i = 1, ..., n in order to minimize
P
the effect of the term nj=1 sjt vj in the diffusion part of (4). We can accomplish this by simply
setting c in (i ) such that unconditionally

II.C Habit dynamics
The particular assumptions on the dynamics of St are of critical importance in habit
persistence models. In particular, Campbell and Cochrane (1999) assume that log (St ) follows
a mean reverting process with shocks that are conditionally perfectly correlated with consumption growth. We depart from Campbell and Cochrane (1999) and impose the stochastic
structure instead on the inverse of the surplus consumption ratio, which we denote Yt ,
Yt =

(6)

Throughout we refer to Yt as the inverse surplus. We assume that it follows a mean reverting
process:

dYt = k Y − Yt dt − α (Yt − λ)

− µc dt ,

(7)

where Y is the long run mean of the inverse surplus and k is the speed of the mean reversion:7

Et [Yτ ] = Y + Yt − Y e−k(τ −t) .

(8)

The parameter α > 0 captures the impact of consumption growth shocks on the inverse surplus
process. A negative shock to consumption growth, for example, results in an increase in the
inverse surplus, or, equivalently, a decrease in the surplus level. Finally, the parameter λ ≥ 1
ensures a lower bound for the inverse surplus, and an upper bound for the surplus itself. For
instance, if the surplus St is to live in [0, .1] (as in the calibration of Campbell and Cochrane
(1999)) then Yt ∈ [10, ∞), and this can be guaranteed by setting λ = 10. Furthermore, this
modeling device avoids the concerns raised by Chapman (1998), namely, the possibility of
negative marginal utility of consumption in habit persistence endowment economies.
7

The stationary density of the inverse surplus process can be found in the Appendix.

III. ASSET PRICES
We assume that markets are complete and, as a consequence, the standard asset pricing
formula holds. That is, if gτ is the payment of a particular asset at time τ , then the price at
time t is:
Ptg



straightforward manipulations of equation (9) yield:



e−φ(τ −t) sgτ Yτ dτ .

(10)

Calculation of the prices then requires computation of the expectation in expression (10)
for the assets of interest. Rather than show prices as a function of Yt , as in (10), we present
the results in terms of the surplus consumption ratio, St , for this is the convention adopted by
Campbell and Cochrane (1999) and others after them (see Li (2001) and Wachter (2000)).
III.A. The price of the total wealth portfolio
The total wealth portfolio gives claim to the whole consumption stream, gτ = Cτ , and
hence sgτ = 1. In this case, the application of equation (8) in the pricing equation (10) leads
immediately to the following proposition:8
Proposition 1. The price consumption ratio of the total wealth portfolio is given by:


PtT W
1
kY
=
1+
St .
(11)
Ct
φ+k
φ
Equation (11) neatly captures the mechanism embedded in habit persistence models. A
positive consumption shock increases St , as it is perfectly correlated with consumption growth,
and this results in an increase of the price consumption ratio. The reason is that a positive
shock in consumption growth makes the investor less risk averse and hence the price of the
total wealth portfolio is bid up relative to the pre-shock level.
8

Throughout the paper, we assume that the parameters for the process for the inverse surplus Yt satisfy the
hR
i
∞
integrability condition Et t e−φ(τ −t) Yτ dτ < ∞. This is sufficient to invoke Fubini Theorem to justify the
inversion of integration and expectation implicit in the derivation of (11).

8

Clearly, if α = 0 and Yt = Y = λ = 1, then St = 1/Y for t ≥ 0 and the price consumption
ratio of the total wealth portfolio is given by 1/φ, the standard price consumption ratio of the
log economy (Rubinstein (1976)).9
III.B The price of individual securities
Now gτ = Dτi and sgτ = siτ , the share of asset i. Since in the case of individual securities
the interaction between cash-flow effects and discount effects is difficult to disentangle, we
solve for two simpler cases first. The first one, in section III.B.1, shuts off the discount-effect
channel, that is, the habit, but it allows for a rich cross-sectional variation in cash-flow betas.
The second case, in section III.B.2, assumes equal cash flow betas but it allows for habit effects.
Section III.B.3 finally combines the two cases.
III.B.1 Model A: Prices in the absence of habit persistence
To shut down the effect of the variation in the degree of risk aversion we must have
Xt = 0 for all t. Hence, we simply set
Model A

α=0

and

Yt = Y = λ = 1

(12)

We then obtain the standard log utility representation with multiple assets. The prices of
individual securities then follow easily: since in equation (10) we have sgτ Yτ = siτ and from (4)
 

Et siτ = si + sit − si e−κ(τ −t)

(13)

by substituting (13) into (10) we find:10
Proposition 2. (Prices under Model A.) Let α = 0 and Yt = Y = λ = 1, then the price of
asset i, PtA,i , is given by

Since 0 < sit < 1 for all t, we can invoke Fubini Thorem to justify the inversion of expectation and the

driven by a common factor, which is the current level of consumption scaled by the average
share, and an idiosyncratic factor which is the distance between the current dividend level,
Dti , and the stochastic trend. The first term accounts for the differences in levels across prices
on average for a given level of consumption and it is discounted by 1/φ. The second term is
responsible for the cross sectional variation observed in prices and it is discounted by the sum
of φ plus the speed of mean reversion, κ. Notice that although the assets are characterized by
different covariances of their own dividend growth with consumption growth, that is, different
θi = vi σc , this last parameter does not enter in the pricing function. The reason is that under
log-utility, the discount factor effects offset cash flow effects. This parameter, however, affects
the time-series of the dividends with respect to consumption growth and hence, as we shall
see, the expected excess returns on this stock.
Armed with expression (14) we can immediately compute the price dividend ratio,
PtA,i

(15)

It follows immediately from (15) that predictable changes in the cross section of price dividend
ratios over the business cycle are exclusively driven by changes in the dispersion of the shares
sit relative to their long term averages. In the presence of consumption growth, those assets
whose shares covary positively with consumption growth will experience, on average, declines
in the price dividend ratios, whereas those that covary negatively will see an increase in their
price dividend ratios.
III.B.2 Model B: Prices in the absence of cash flow effects
To asses the impact of the variation in the discount factor on the cross section of stock
prices we now shut down the “cash flow effect.” We do this by requiring that share growth


As in the previous case, the prices of individual securities are easy to obtain. Since from
condition (16), the shares sit and the inverse surplus Yt are independent processes, we have
10



 
Et siτ Yτ = Et siτ Et [Yτ ]. We can then use formulas (13) and (8) and insert them in the
pricing equation (10) to easily obtain the result in the following proposition:

(18)

As in expression (14) there are two terms in the price formula. The first one captures
the variation due to the common factor. Now the effect of shocks in consumption, which affect
i

Dt = si Ct , is amplified whenever the surplus is relatively high, as investors are in this case less
risk averse. The second term captures the source of idiosyncratic variation, both in the time
series and the cross section. Once again idiosyncratic shocks to dividends will be amplified
whenever St is high.
Similarly to Model A, straightforward manipulations of equation (18) yield the following
expression for the price dividend ratio,

(19)

Model B has very different implications for the behavior of the cross section of price
dividend ratios over the business cycle when compared to Model A. Recall that in the latter
predictable changes in the cross section were exclusively driven by changes in the distribution
of shares due to their covariance with consumption growth, the channel that is shut down here.
In contrast, now cash flow shocks have a very different effect on the cross section depending
on whether they occur during business cycle peaks or troughs. As can be immediately seen
from expression (19), cash flow shocks are magnified during peaks and dampened in troughs.
Moreover, as the next proposition shows, even in the absence of cash flow shocks the cross
section of price dividend ratios is sensitive to the business cycle.
Proposition 4. For a given distribution of shares, the cross sectional variance of price
dividend ratios is an increasing function of the surplus consumption ratio.
That is, the cross sectional dispersion of the price dividend ratios increases during business cycle peaks and decreases during troughs.
11

III.B.3 Prices in the general case
The model in the general case is considerably more complex than Models A and B, and
a closed form solution is not available. Instead we offer an approximate solution, where the
nature of the approximation is sketched in Section VII. Numerical computation of prices show
the approximation is within 0.1% of the true price for the set of portfolios we consider. Prices
for the general case then are given by

Pti ≈ ω i PtA,i λSt + 1 − ω i PtB,i ,

(20)

where
ωi =

αθi
,
φ + k + κ + αθi

(21)

and we recall that θi = vi σc0 . Under condition (5), θi is simply the unconditional covariance
between the growth rate of shares dsit /sit and consumption growth dCt /Ct .11 In equation (21),
φ + k + κ + αθi has the interpretation of a discount rate and it is assumed to be positive. The
sign of ω i is then solely determined by the sign of θi .
In order to better interpret equation (20) it is useful to write it as:

Pti ≈ ω i PtA,i + 1 − ω i PtB,i + ω i (λSt − 1) PtA,i .

(22)

The price of asset i is a linear combination of the price of the asset found for Model A
and that of Model B plus a correction that interacts the surplus consumption ratio with the
price of the asset under Model A. To interpret further the last term of equation (22) recall first
that St λ ≤ 1. Assume then that asset i’s share covaries positively with consumption growth,
ω i > 0. In this case the asset provides little insurance against adverse shocks in consumption
growth as the asset pays on average little in those states. As a consequence
ω i (λSt − 1) PtA,i < 0,
and the asset trades at a discount relatively to an otherwise identical asset with zero or negative
covariance with consumption growth. This effect enters multiplicatively the price of the asset
under Model A, which allows for a general covariance structure of dividend growth with consumption growth. Roughly, one can interpret the expression ω i (λSt − 1) as the correction one
needs to add to the price of the asset that corresponds to the logarithmic economy when the

degree of risk aversion is different than one. Moreover the magnitude of the insurance discount
depends on where the economy finds itself over the business cycle. In troughs, |λSt − 1| is very
large and so is the discount of the asset whose cash flows covary positively with consumption
growth. When the economy experiences positive consumption growth shocks St increases and
the price discount |λSt − 1| diminishes accordingly.
From equation (20), it is immediate to obtain an expression for the price-dividend ratio
in the general case. Since the formula can be readily computed from (15) and (19), we avoid
repeating it here. Importantly, though, in the general case we can still expect that a result
similar to Proposition 4 holds. However, the contemporaneous correlation of shares sit and
surplus St makes it hard to obtain a general proposition. A thorough assessment of the model
on this dimension is then postponed until Section VII.
IV. ASSET RETURNS
In this section we compute the risk free rate and the expected excess rate of return of
the total wealth portfolio and individual securities. We solve for these quantities insofar as
they permit a better understanding of the relationship between cashflows, discount factors,
and asset prices, as explained in the introduction. The reader is referred to Menzly, Santos,
and Veronesi (2002) for an empirical investigation of the implications of our model for returns.
In order to compute the expected rate of return of the different assets it is useful to
consider first the pricing kernel process,

any asset, which is the instantaneous covariance between the increments in returns and the

IV.A The risk free rate
The risk free rate is given by µm (St ), that is,

rf (St ) = φ + µc − σc σc0 + k 1 − Y St − α (1 − λSt ) σc σc0 ,

(25)

a version of the formula found in Campbell and Cocrane (1999). The interpretation of this
formula is standard (see Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay (1997), page 331, equation 8.4.19.)

The excess return on the total wealth portfolio is
dRtT W =

− rf (St ).

To understand the intuition, consider first the case where consumption is far away from
habit, that is St = λ−1 . In this case, risk-aversion is low and expected returns and variance are
low, both equal to σc σc0 . As St decreases, current consumption gets closer to the habit level,
which in turn increases both the degree of risk aversion and the volatility of the returns on the
total wealth portfolio. These two effects contribute to increase the premium investors require
to hold stocks. As St gets close to zero, however, the volatility of the surplus also declines to


zero, because St is a process in 0, λ−1 . This latter property carries over to the volatility of
returns, that declines when St approaches zero, partially undoing the effect of the increase in
the degree of risk aversion. When this effect is large enough the required premium falls.
However, this effect does not apply to the Sharpe ratio, which is always decreasing in St :

The Sharpe ratio then moves countercyclically, decreasing in booms and raising in recessions. The Sharpe ratio plays an important role in the interpretation of the formulas for the
returns of individual securities below.
To synthesize the properties of the aggregate variables in this model, and to compare
them to the model of Campbell and Cochrane (1999), Panels A-D of Figure 3 plot some of the
aggregate variables against the level of the surplus St . The plots use calibrated parameters, as
discussed in section V. Panel A plots the stationary density of the surplus-consumption ratio
St , given the calibrated parameters. Panel B plots the price-consumption ratio of the total
wealth portfolio, which has the characteristic upward slope with respect to St . Panel C plots
the excess expected return and volatility of the total wealth portfolio, along with the real rate
of interest. Finally, Panel D plots the Sharpe-ratio of the total wealth portfolio, as function of
the state variable St . Comparison with the corresponding Figures in Campbell and Cochrane
(1999, see Figures 2 to 6, pages 219-223) reveals essentially the same qualitative behavior of all
these functions. The only difference is in the expected returns and volatility functions, as they
bend back towards zero as St gets close to zero. However, the region of St where these function
are upward sloping has a very small unconditional probability, as shown by the stationary
density of St in Panel A.
IV.C The return on individual securities
We now turn to individual securities. Again, it is useful to first compute the return
processes for the two special cases introduced in Section III.
IV.C.1 Model A: Returns in the absence of habit persistence
We start by finding the expected excess rate of return in the absence of habit persistence
effects. First recall that in the standard log economy the expected excess rate of return of the
total wealth portfolio is simply given by σc σc0 . Then the next propositions characterizes the
basic moments of the returns of individual securities.
Proposition 5. (Expected returns under Model A) Let α = 0 and Yt = Y = λ = 1, then the
expected excess rate of return of asset i, µA,i

0, will command a higher premium than the total wealth portfolio, as the asset provides little
insurance against adverse consumption shocks. This is more so as sit increases, as the asset
will make a larger fraction of consumption. Clearly, the opposite argument holds for the case
where the dividend-consumption share covaries negatively with consumption growth.
IV.C.2 Model B: Returns in the absence of cash flow effects
When habit persistence is present but there are no cash flow effects, there can be no
cross sectional dispersion in expected returns in the long run and all the variation observed in
sample is solely due to conditional cross sectional variation. This conditional cross sectional
variation is driven by shocks to cash flows but these shocks have rather different effect on the
cross section depending on when they occur over the business cycle.

To understand the intuition behind (32) take the case where sit < si . In this case the
dividends of asset i are likely to experience growth above that of consumption and this effect
gets incorporated into current prices. Still, the conditional expected excess returns are above
that of the total wealth portfolio. At this stage it is useful to return to the price of asset i
under Model B, given in expression (18) and that we can rewrite as

where PtT W is given in equation (11). When sit < si the second term in parenthesis becomes
negative and hence the relative impact of changes in the level of PtT W on Pti increases. This
decreases the diversification opportunities offered by asset i and hence increases its required
premium to hold it. The second effect is a “dampening” or “hedging” effect: If sit < si then
positive shocks to Ct , and hence to St , translate into negative shocks of the second term in
parenthesis, which partly counterbalance the positive movement in PtT W induced by the same
shocks. It can be shown though that the first “level” effect dominates the “hedging” one.
IV.C.3 Returns in the general case
We use our approximate pricing formula to obtain the expected excess rate of return of
individual assets in the general case. The formula for returns simply combines the two sources
discussed in the previous two subsections, as it is given by
µiR,t ≈ (1 + α (1 − λSt ))







1 + γ1 sit , St St (1 − λSt ) α + γ2 sit , St sit θi σc σc0

(33)



where the functions γ1 sit , St > 0 and γ2 sit , St > 0 are given in equations (39) and (40) in
Appendix B.
Briefly, the first term in the product, (1 + α (1 − λSt )), is proportional to the Sharpe
ratio of the total wealth portfolio and, naturally, it is common across assets. When the Sharpe
ratio is high, which occurs when the surplus consumption ratio is low, this term is high and as
a consequence so will be the expected excess rate of return. The first term in brackets is related
to the covariation of the marginal rate of substitution with changes in the surplus consumption
ratio, and it is similar in intuition to the one in discussed in Section IV.C.2 (Model B). Instead,
the second term in the bracket captures the component of the premium that results from the
covariation of the marginal rate of substitution with the asset’s cash flow shocks, and it is
similar to the one in discussed in Section IV.C.1 (Model A).12
V. CALIBRATION
V.A Data
We calculated quarterly dividends, returns, market equity and other financial series from
the CRSP database. We use CRSP and COMPUSTAT data files to form 20 value-weighted

industry every month formed according to their two digit Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC) code.13 Finally, whenever possible, we augmented our financial series with accounting
data from the Compustat data base. To merge the two files we rely on the link structure issued
by CRSP. Table II provides a description of the industry portfolio and summary statistics.
The real consumption data is obtained from the National Income and Product Accounts
(NIPA) for the period 1946-2001. As many before us, we define total consumption as nondurables plus services. We use the Shiller (1989) annual data for the period 1927-1945, where
we interpolate the consumption data to obtain quartely quantities.14 The risk free rate is the
90-day Treasury bill and the inflation rate is calculated using the Consumer Price Index.15
V.B Model parameters

V.B.1 Preference parameters, φ, k, Y , λ, α
We use the stationary distribution of the process Yt , given in equation (36) in the ap
pendix, to calibrate the preference parameters, φ, k, Y , λ, α , to the aggregate market portfolio and interest rates. For a given choice of parameters, we can then compute the population
averages of expected returns, return volatility, and price-consumption ratio for the total wealth
portfolio, and the average level and volatility of risk-free rate. We match the population averages for the total wealth portfolio with the corresponding values for the market portfolio in the
data. Clearly the total wealth portfolio and the market portfolio are different but our results
show that they are very similar in terms of moments and prices. For this reason we use the
total wealth portfolio as we have convenient formulas for the returns and prices that can be
easily used to match them to data.16
13

The two digit SIC grouping are similar to those employed by Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999) and Boudoukh,

Richardson and Whitelaw (1994). The SIC codes are obtained from CRSP, which reports the time-series of
industry classification codes. Although the COMPUSTAT classification is considered to be more accurate, the
series is modified only from 1994, which leads to a survival bias.
14
We also tested our results in the period starting in 1963 to reflect the concerns of some authors that the
sample of firms in COMPUSTAT is limited in the earlier part of the sample. See Fama and French (1997, page
156.) This is also the sample period chosen by Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999). In addition, we also used the
sample from 1953:1 to 1999, favored by some as it avoids the Korean war. See, among others, Campbell and
Mankiw (1990). The results were very similar and are not reported here.
15
The real rate has been computed as rR,t = rN,t − Et [inflationt ], where the latter is obtained from fitting
an AR(4) to the inflation process.
16
That the distinction between the total wealth portfolio and the market portfolio is less relevant than may
seem at first is also to be found in Campbell and Cochrane (1999), see in particular their comments in page 221.

18

In our model λ and Y cannot be identified separately: All our pricing implications
depend on the ratios Y /Yt and λ/Yt . Given the linearity of the process (7), if we scale Y , λ
and Yt by a constant, no changes will occur to the prices, returns or interest rates. Without
any loss of generality then we choose to set the average inverse surplus to match the steady
state degree of risk aversion in Campbell and Cochrane (1999), Y = 29.6.17 The remaining
parameters {φ, k, λ, α} are then obtained by matching (i) the average excess stock return, (ii)
the average interest rate, (iii) the interest rate volatility, (iv), the average price consumption
ratio and (v) the average Sharpe ratio. The parameter values so obtained are in Panel A of
Table III, while the population averages of the total-wealth portfolio, as well as the sample
averages in the 1927-2001 periods are in Table IV. The calibrated model succeeds in matching
the equity premium, the average price-dividend ratio, the volatility of market returns, and the
Sharpe ratio. The model also delivers the right level and volatility of the risk free rate.

V.B.2 Share process parameters, κ, si , vi i=1,···,n
The share process (4) presents several challenges for the estimation. A full analysis of
the estimation procedure is outside the scope of this paper and we leave it to future research.
Here we outline a simple estimation procedure, which relies on an approximation of the share
process that is similar to the one we used to obtain prices of individual assets in the general
case. Monte Carlo simulations show that this methodology works well when n is “large” and
the variance of the share process is not too large. Appendix B contains additional details.

The methodology is in two steps: First, we estimate the drift parameters κ, s1 , .., sn
through GMM applied to the Euler discretization of the process (4). Since by assumption the
process for shares has a stochastic volatility, we use a two-stage GMM with NW corrected

variance covariance matrix. The second steps is to compute the vectors v1 , .., vn . To do
Pn
j j
this, we assume that the term
j=1 st v that appears in the volatility function in (4) is
approximately constant. In this case, we can back out the vectors vi ’s from the variancecovariance matrix of the process for the log sit . The results of the estimation are contained
17

This value of Y is slightly higher than the one in Campbell and Cochrane (1999). The steady state surplus

consumption ratio these authors is S = .0676. Given that they work with γ = 2 rather than with γ = 1, their
steady state degree of risk aversion is

γ
S

≈ 29.6. The difference is due to the fact that our results match the

numerical average in our generated Campbell and Cochrane (1999) surplus consumption series. Clearly, the
choice of λ affects the volatility of the habit and this prevents setting it equal to its perhaps natural boundary
of one as this would induce, contrary to intuition, excessive volatility in the habit.

in Panel B of Table III. We do not report the entire matrix v = v1 , ..., vn , but only the
coefficients that are relevant for pricing, namely, θi = vi σc0 .
VI. MODEL EVALUATION
To evaluate the model we conduct two types of excercises. First, in Section VI.A we run
simulations of our economy. This will allow us to compute moments that are of interest and
for which we have no closed form solutions. Then in Section VI.B we evaluate whether our
model can account for the observed financial history of the US. To accomplish this we feed the
formulas found in Section III the realized consumption and cash flow shocks and ask whether
the calibrated time series can reproduce the main patterns observed in the data.
VI.A Performance of the model in simulated data
We simulate 10,000 time series of length equal to the available time series. To ease the
comparison with data, we simulate consumption and shares at very small intervals (1 day)
but retain information only at the quarterly frequency. This generates a number of quarters
slightly above the two million mark. The simulations employ the parameter values reported
in Section V. In order not to bias the simulation procedure, each simulation includes an initial
“burn out” period so each simulation starts in a randomly selected point.
VI.A.1 Means and standard deviations
Panel A of Table IV reports some summary statistics from the simulations for aggregate
variables, namely, the market portfolio and the interest rate. As already mentioned, the model
is sufficiently flexible to match well the sample moments of the market portfolio. In particular
the Sharpe ratio is matched almost to the point. In addition the volatility of market returns,
a moment that was not used to calibrate the model, is close to that observed in the data. The
model succeeds as well in reproducing the level and volatility of the risk free rate, a standard
difficulty in habit persistence models. The model is then able to reproduce the results of
Campbell and Cochrane (1999) for the market portfolio.
Importantly the calibration did not use any cross sectional information and it is here
that the validity of the model can start to be objectively assessed. Panel B reports some
summary statistics about the cross-section of prices and returns of industry portfolios. For
ease of comparison with the actual realized averages, Figure 4 plots the main results contained
in Table IV Panel B. Panel A in Figure 4 plots the the sample average excess return for each
20

industry versus the mean obtained of our simulation. The model is able to generate average
excess returns across industries that are close to those observed in the data though the sample
average is slightly above the average return obtained across simulations. This is to be expected,
given that the same occurs at the market portfolio level.
Panel B plots the sample average price-dividend ratios versus the average price dividend
ratio in the simulated data. Once again the model reproduces its sample counterpart with the
only exception of Construction, where the model generates an average price dividend ratio well
out of line with data. Finally, Panel C reports the sample average Sharpe ratios versus their
simulations counterpart, and once again the model performs well. The model is then able to
replicate the trade-off between risk and return across industries.
VI.A.2 Predictability in the aggregate and in the individual industries
Table V contains the results from standard predictability regressions, both in the data
and in the simulations. Panel A reports results for the aggregate market portfolio. For completeness, and to ease the comparison with previous research, we report the predictability
regressions for two samples periods, the full sample 1927-2001 and for the shorter and most
standard postwar sample 1947-1994. Similarly to Campbell and Cochrane, who also use a long
and short sample though both ending in 1995, the model produces a good deal of predictability
at the aggregate level. The model successfully reproduces the increasing nature of R2 s versus
the horizon. For example, the average R2 across simulations in a two year ahead predictability
regression is 17.7%, against a 6% in the full sample and 29% in the post-war sample. At the
5 year horizon, the numbers are 26.7% in average across simulations, and 12% and 56% in
the long and short sample respectively. Importantly the predictability in the short sample is
stronger than in the 1927-2001 one as the former excludes the period 1995-2001 that saw high
price dividend ratios and high realized returns.
Panel B reports the predictability regressions for individual industries, which, as before,
can be more easily grasped graphically. Figure 5 Panel A shows that, consistently with the data
corresponding to the long sample period, the model produces a large cross-sectional difference
in the two and five year ahead predictability of returns, though it slightly overestimates the
two year predictability. The model successfully reproduces the low predictability for industries
such as Mining, Construction, and Railroads and the high predictability for Chemical and
Utilities. The model does also well for industries with an intermediate level of predictability

21

like Dept. Stores. Similar results obtain for the five year predictability (Figure 5 Panel B.)
How are we to interpret this cross sectional variation within the context of our model?
Predictability at the aggregate level is exclusively driven by time-variation in the surplusconsumption ratio St , which affects the stochastic discount factor. In the case of individual
assets though, to the impact of the time variation in the stochastic discount factor we have
to add the fluctuations of share sit around its long run mean si , as equation (33) shows. This
additional effect is purely idiosyncratic and it induces differences in the extent to which price
dividend ratios can predict future returns across industries. To isolate this cash flow component
consider, for example, Model A where the variation in the stochastic discount factor was shut
down. Then, by simple manipulation of formula (29) we find

R,t ≈ σc σc + (φ + κ) θ

where we have imposed that, approximately,

Pti

≈ 0 (see condition (5)). The level of θi

determines the level of predictability in the absence of discount factor effects. In such a model,
expected returns change as the covariance between consumption and returns is regulated by
the shares, sit , and hence by the dividend price ratio. When there are discount factor effects,
the interaction between the cash flows and the discount factor becomes hard to disentangle
and a high θi may even result in less predictability. For example, suppose that a stock’s share
is positively correlated with consumption. Then sit will, on average, decrease with St . The
effect on the price-dividend ratio is now ambiguous. On the one hand, a lower St results
in a lower price dividend ratio as the investor has become more risk averse. On the other,
the lower sit will tend to push the price dividend ratio up, as dividend growth above that of
consumption is expected. Notice though that both effects unambiguously contribute to the
increase in expected returns.
Another factor that affects the extent to which industry returns are predictable is the
0

volatility of cash flows, determined by vi vi . Clearly, other things equal, the higher this
volatility the lower the predictability as a larger component of the variation in returns is driven
by shocks to cash flows, a point to which we return in the next section. Finally, assets differ in
one additional dimension and it is in their long run contribution to the overall consumption,
si . Provided that sit is close to its long run mean, the higher the value of si the closer the asset
is to being effectively the market portfolio and hence the higher the predictability of returns

22

of asset i.18
The next section uses standard price-dividend ratio decompositions applied to industry
portfolios in order to shed some additional light on the predictability results.
VI.A.3 The variance decomposition: news to cash flows and news to expected returns
Variation in price dividend ratios of individual securities is driven by both changes in
the forecasts of dividend growth and changes in the forecasts of future discount rates, the two
building blocks of our model. To asses how much of the variance of the price dividend ratio of
individual industry portfolios is driven by each component in the data we can use the variance
decomposition of the (log) price dividend ratio proposed by Cochrane (1992),

and then compare these sample estimates with their counterparts in the simulations. As argued
in the previous section this exercise will throw light on the cross sectional differences in the
predictability regressions.
Table VI contains the results of this variance decomposition. Recall that the decomposition is not an orthogonal one so quantities higher than 100% and less than 0% are possible.
Panel A contains the results at the aggregate level and it shows that the model matches the
data to a good degree: Essentially, most of the variation in the price-dividend ratio in the
model (at the aggregate level) stems from changes in returns, that is, changes in the stochastic
discount factor.
Panel B contains the same variance decomposition across industries which are more
conveniently presented in Figure 6. The return component makes for a large part of the
variance of price dividend ratios for many of the industries in our sample. In particular, it
does so strongly for Paper, Chemical, Petroleum, Construction, Machinery, Electrical Eq. and
Utilities. Mining, Food and Retail on the other hand seems to be equally driven by each
18

To confirm these intuitions, in results not reported here, we regressed the predictability obtained in the

model, as measured by the R2 of the two and five year predictability regressions for each industry, on the
0

three parameters that completely determine the cash flow process for each asset, vi vi , θi , and si . The three
parameters came strongly significant with the expected signs, and explained more than 85% of the variation in
the cross-sectional differences in average R2 across simulations.

23

component. Finally, the variance of the price dividend ratio of Prim. Metals and Railroads is
dominated by its cash flow component.
The model also produces considerable cross-sectional differences in the variance decomposition across industries, and for most industries it replicates the empirical counterpart to a
good extent. For example, as in the data, the model also predicts that the price-dividend ratios
of Chemicals, Petroleum and Utilities should be mainly driven by shocks to returns, the ones
of Prim. Metals and Railroads should be mainly driven by shocks to cash flows, and the one
of Food should be equally driven by the two sources. For other industries, however, the model
seems to slightly underpredict the fraction of the variance of the price dividend ratio that is
driven by the return component and slightly overpredict the fraction that is driven by cash
flow shocks. Thus, for a number of industries, such as Machinery, Electrical Eq. and Paper,
the model predicts a more equal weight across the two sources of variation in price-dividend
ratios than the data imply. Finally, for some industries, such as Construction, Apparel and
Paper, the model’s predictions are not reflected in the data estimates. Yet, the model succedes
in producing large cross-sectional differences in the sensitivity of the price-dividend ratio to
cash flow shocks and return shocks.
The intuition for this result can be grasped by looking at equation (20). After simple

manipulations, we can write the price-dividend ratio as Pti /Dti ≈ ψ0i (St ) + ψ1i (St ) si /sit , for
two functions ψ0i (St ) and ψ1i (St ) . For typical parameter values we have ∂ψ1i (S) /∂S > 0.
Consider now an asset i characterized by a relatively low volatility of sit . In this case, most of
the variation of the price-dividend ratio stems from changes in St , which is related to aggregate
returns. Thus, a variance decomposition would reveal a large return component. Conversely,
an asset characterized by a large volatility of the share sit would have a price-dividend ratio
greatly affected by the movement in sit . Thus, the variation of price-dividend ratios would be
mainly affected by cash flow shocks.19 This intuition nicely links our empirical results with
those of Vuolteenaho (2002). Indeed, he finds that firm-level returns are mainly driven by cash
flow shocks, and that these cash flow news are essentially idiosyncratic. Within the context of
our model, we can see that at the very disaggregate level, the (idiosyncratic) volatility of shares
19

As for the predictability case, we verified this intuition by regressing cross-sectionally the average (across-

simulations) cash-flow component and return component of the variance of the P/D ratios on the various
characteristics of the cash-flow process. The volatility vi vi0 is by far the most important driving force of the
cross-sectional differences, with the signs as explained in the text.

24

would be very high, generating most of the variance of the price-dividend ratio. In the case of
industries, instead, aggregation reduces the (idiosyncratic) volatility of shares, increasing then
the role of returns in the variance decomposition. In the limit, at the aggregate market level,
cash flow news have little effect and only returns affect the price-dividend ratio.
VI.B The historical performance of the US stock market
Inspection of equation (20), together with equations (14) and (18), highlights the obvious:
The model makes point by point predictions of what the price should have been given the
realized fundamentals. If there is any discrepancy between the historical price and the one
implied by the model then this can be immediately rejected. Still, does our model reproduce
the main patterns observed in the historical experience of the US stock market? To answer
this question, we feed the pricing formulas in Section III.B.3 the observed consumption and
cash flow shocks and see whether the resulting prices match the observed patterns.
VI.B.1 Aggregate quantities
Figure 7 Panel A plots the surplus consumption ratio implied by the model once we feed
to the estimated model the observed consumption shocks. Panel A also includes the surplus
consumption ratio of Campbell and Cochrane (1999) for comparison’s sake. The two series
track each other tightly. The surplus consumption ratio captures the main patterns of the US
business cycle: The depression of the 30s (with St hitting almost zero), the 1960’s expansion,
the recession in the mid 70’s and early 80’s, the recovery afterwards, the mild recession of the
early 90’s and the strong expansion that followed it. It also shows the start of the new recession
at the end of 2001. Panel B includes the consumption series together with the habit level, Xt ,
implied by our surplus consumption series. As intuition suggests, the habit level moves slowly
and tracks consumption.
Panel C of Figure 7 reports the plot of the time-series of market portfolio log pricedividend ratio in the data and the one generated by the model. As found by Campbell and
Cochrane (1999), the model offers a remarkable account of the realized history of the log price
dividend ratio of the market portfolio. Still there are two interesting periods in which the
model generated price dividend ratio does not track the realized one. First, the model is not
able to replicate the extraordinary performance of the market in the second half of the 90s,
a usual shortcoming. There are two possible explanations for this. First, the percentage of
firms that switched from dividend distribution to share repurchases as a mean of distributing
25

earnings increased considerably in the 90s (see Fama and French (2002)). If this is the case,
cash distributions would be seriously underestimated during this period and as a consequence
the price dividend ratio would appear higher than its actual level. An alternative explanation,
one favoured by many, is that the nineties witnessed a phenomenal speculative bubble, a
possibility our model does not allow for. Further research is then needed to account for the
performance of the market in the 90s.
Second, the model also predicts price dividend ratios that are lower than the realized
ones during most of the 30s. The reason is simple and it stems from the high volatility of
consumption growth during the 30s, which led the surplus-consumption ratio St to hit almost
zero. From Panel A of Figure 3, the stationary distribution of St shows that this is an almost
zero-probability event and it stems from a slight mispecification of the model. Indeed, in
order to account for this behavior, we should assume that consumption growth has a timevarying volatility, which we have ruled out in our assumption that consumption growth is i.i.d.
Although the model implies an unrealistically low price dividend ratio during this period, we
prefer to keep the model simple rather than construct an even more complicated model to
account for the 30s.
VI.B.2 The price-consumption ratios across industries
Figures 8 and 9 plot the fitted and the actual price-consumption ratios for the 20 industries in our sample. The reason for concentrating on the price consumption ratios, rather than
on price dividend ratios, is that we want to asses whether the model can account for the observed levels of prices, and it is best to normalize them by a common factor like consumption in
order to make them stationary. Dividing each industry’s price by its corresponding dividend
obscures the comparison as dividend measurement error may be different across industries.
Still, price dividend ratio plots are very similar to the price consumption ratio ones.
As we can see, the model implied price consumption ratios track well their empirical
counterparts. For instance, the fitted time series account for the secular decline of Railroads
and Primary Metals and the steady rise of Financials. It also explains the main fluctuations
in Chemical, Fab. Metals, Food, Paper, Machinery, Electric Eq., Retail, and Others. The
model seems to be less successful in explaining the time series of Construction, Utilities or
Transportation Equipment.
Notice also that, interestingly enough, price consumption ratios for some industries saw

26

remarkable levels during the late 60s and early 70s. For instance, Manufacturing, Apparel,
and Other Transportation saw levels of price consumption ratios during that period that have
no equivalent at any other point in time. Our model captures the rise in the price consumption ratio of Apparel and partly the one of Other Transportation, but it misses the one in
Manufacturing.20
To better understand the differences between all these time series it is illustrative to
concentrate on two industries for which the model seems to perform well: Paper and Railroads.
Panels A and B in Figure 10 reproduce the price consumption ratios, both fitted and realized,
for these two industries. Panels C and D report the two shares that correspond to these two
industries. First notice the long decline that Railroads has experienced during our sample
period. The decline in its price consumption ratio mirrors the decreasing importance of this
sector in the overall market. The price consumption ratio held relatively well during the
1960s, precisely when the share decline temporarily halted and even rose slightly. Importantly,
the time series pattern of the price consumption ratio of Railroads seems dominated by its
idiosyncratic component: The precipitous drop of its share over consumption. Business cycle
components seem less important and the price consumption ratio does not react to either the
mid seventies or early eighties recession.
Paper shows a rather different pattern. First, the share of Paper experienced an important increase in the decade following WWII and remained fairly constant after that, perhaps
showing early hints of a recent decline. The price consumption ratio mirrored these developments but with a certain lag, due to the fact that the economy experienced a downturn after
the conflict that undid the positive effect of the share increase in the price. Indeed notice that
St declined considerably after 1945-6. It is then only in the fifties that the price consumption
ratio of Paper “catches up” with its share’s increase.21 The trend continued during the next
20

The sudden rise of the price consumption ratio during those years seems largely to be restricted to these

three industries, whereas the rise in the 90s happens in ten of the twenty industries. Of these three industries
only Apparel and Other Transport. saw a slight rise and then decline in their shares (these plots are not
reported,) which can account for the qualitatively aspect of the pattern but certainly not enough quantitatively.
The share of Manufacturing saw a steady increase throughout that period.
21
At this point it is illustrative to compare our model with the traditional Gordon model. The latter implies
a price consumption ratio that is proportional to sit . For this reason the Gordon model would have the price
consumption ratio of Paper to immediately react to the increase in the share. In contrast our model manages
to reproduce the lag as it allows for the countervailing effect of the decrease in the surplus consumption ratio.

27

two decades, when the surplus consumption ratio was on the rise, but it was cut when the
recession in the mid seventies kicked in and that continued all the way to early eighties, when
the worst recession in the post-war period set in. Paper recuperated after that and benefited
from the increase in the surplus consumption ratio that now undoes the effect of a declining
share on the price consumption ratio.
In summary, as presented in section III, prices are driven by both idiosyncratic components and aggregate ones, and their importance is rather different depending on the particular
industry. The model and its calibration are able to capture a crucial component in the diverse
historical experiences present in the cross section.
VI.B.3 The time series of the cross sectional standard deviation of asset prices
Figure 11 plots the cross-sectional dispersion of price-consumption ratios (Panel A) and
price-dividend ratios (Panel B), and their empirical counterpart.22 The plots have a number
of implications: First, Panel A shows that the cross-sectional dispersion of asset prices is, to a
first degree, generated by dividend levels. This follows from the fact that basic manipulations
of the formulas found in Section III.B.3 show that the price consumption ratio of an individual
industry is linear in the share, sit , although with stochastic coefficients. Second, a comparison
of the fitted plot with the dynamics of the surplus St in the top panel of Figure 7 reveals that
the standard deviation of price consumption ratios drops when St does as well.
Panel B shows the cross-sectional standard deviation of price-dividend ratios. Also in this
case the model produces the correct level of dispersion and the correct dynamics: Interestingly,
while the cross-sectional dispersion of price dividend ratios increased slowly in the 50s and 60s
to drop in the 70s, our model produced a much quicker increase in dispersion in the middle of
the 50s, and steady decline until the end of 70s, where it matched again the level of the crosssectional dispersion of price dividend ratios in the data. Then, both series increase, although
the 90s saw the dispersion in the data surge considerably.
Table VII shows the correlation between the time-series of the market price dividend ratio
and the time-series of the cross-sectional dispersions of the price dividend ratios of individual
assets both in the data and the simulations. The model successfully accounts for a large
Of course, the Gordon model can be easily rejected as it does not allow for time varying price dividend ratios.
22
Differently from Figure 1, we plot the cross-sectional standard deviation of the level of price-consumption
ratios and price-dividend ratios, as we are interested in seeing the fit against their empirical counterparts, and
not the correlation with the market price consumption ratio.

28

percentage of the correlation though not all. Specifically, while the model produces an average
correlation (across simulations) between the market log price dividend ratio and the crosssectional dispersion of individual price dividend ratios of about 23%, the data show a higher
number, about 75%. In levels, the respective numbers are 44% and 89%. Recall that we
showed that for a given set of shares sit ’s, the cross-sectional dispersion of price dividend ratios
increases as St increases. However, the time variation in sit , possibly also correlated with the
market, is an additional source of variation in price dividend ratios. This source of variation in
the cross section seems as important in the model as the fluctuations in the stochastic discount
factor and hence the failure to capture all the correlation between the price dividend ratio of
the market portfolio and the cross sectional standard deviation.
When we concentrate on the first differences the results improve further and the model
seems to account for an even larger percentage of the correlation between the first difference
of the price dividend ratio of the market portfolio and the first difference of the cross sectional
standard deviation of individual price dividend ratios. For instance, these time series have
a .75 correlation coefficient in the data whereas the simulations of the model produce a .52
correlation coefficient. The numbers when the series are in logs are .40 and .27 respectively.
VII. DISCUSSION
VII.A The cash flow model
This paper models cash flows in order to obtain formulas for prices. Unlike previous
models though, ours is a full general equilibrium model where restrictions are imposed in the
cash flow processes to make them consistent with the observed US consumption process. A
natural question then is whether ours is a “good” model of cash flows. The answer to this
question requires a thorough empirical analysis that goes beyond the objective of this paper
and certainly the cash flow model could be relaxed along several dimensions. Still we argue
that any sensible model of cash flows will conform to the main characteristics of the model
proposed in equation (4).
As Bossaerts and Green (1990) recognized, general equilibrium imposes tight restrictions
in the set of processes that generate the dividends, otherwise one may posit a process for a
particular source of income that may end up accounting for the whole consumption process
or even more than it. This would naturally induce rather counterfactual predictions for prices
29

and returns. The share process (4) naturally defines each source as a fraction of the overall
consumption in a way that prevents any such source from completely dominating consumption.
Some of these sources may appear to have trends in sample as they converge to their natural
long run level, si .
If the share technology is a sensible modeling device, one is left to argue the specific
functional form of both the drift and diffusion parts. As for the volatility, what is critical is
that the exposure of the share to additional shocks “dies” in the boundary in order to keep it
confined in the unit simplex. The behavior of the volatility when the share is far from these
boundaries may be important to address some empirical regularities and here we accepted this
particular functional form for its convenient tractability.
As for the drift component, a perhaps strong assumption is that we implicitly assume
that the investors know the long run contribution of any sector to the overall consumption. It
can be shown that the linearity of the model can be used to extend the results here reported
to the case where agents use cash flow shocks to learn about si . This extension, that we intend
to explore in future research, has important implications for the pricing equations. To sketch
briefly the intuition behind these results, it is useful to concentrate in the case of Model A
in Section II.B.1 . As we saw there, a positive dividend shock that places the share sit above
its long run contribution necessarily results in a decrease in the price dividend ratio. That is,
when dividends go up, prices go up as well but by less than the dividend amount (see equation
(15)). The reason is that, a positive dividend shock signals weak dividend growth as the share
will mean revert to its long run level. Instead, if agents update on si , a positive dividend shock
yields an upward revision on this estimate, which can, in turn, result in an increase in the
price dividend ratio. Essentially learning about si induces additional sources of variation in
the prices and returns of individual securities.
VII.B Using price data to learn about the parameters of the cash flow model
So far we have not used of information other than cash flow data in order to avoid
contaminating our assessment of whether the model can account for the empirical regularities
of the cross section. Of course, if the purpose is to estimate the parameters of the cash flow
model, use of asset pricing data can lead to better estimates of these fundamental parameters.
In particular, estimation of the long run shares si can be much improved by the inclusion
of financial data for prices contain market expectations about the long run contribution of a

30

particular sector to the overall level of consumption.23
Although a full fledged estimation of the model using prices and returns deserves a thorough examination, we can compute the level of si that makes the average price-consumption
ratio in the data equal to the average fitted price-consumption ratio. We keep all the other
parameters, including the shares’ speed of mean reversion κ, as in Table II. The result of this
simple exercise is contained in Figure 12. The figure shows that in order to match the average price-consumption ratio, the average long-term share of Petroleum, Construction, Primary
Metals, Transportation Eq. and Utilities should be lower than the average historical level,
while the ones of Machinery, Electrical Eq., Manufacturing, Dept. Stores and Retail should be
higher. In other words, since we can interpret the average si as the expected long-term shares
from investors’ perspective, the first set of industries are expected to decline in relative size
compared to their historical averages, while the second set of industry is expected to increase
in relative size.
VII.C The nature of the approximation for prices
As already mentioned, we can only offer approximate formulas for the general case.
To understand the nature of the approximation recall that, in order to obtain a closed form
solution for prices, the integral in expression (10) needs to be solved. The heart of the technical
problem is then the characterization of the process qti = sit Yt . By Ito’s Lemma, the drift of the
stochastic process for qti includes the term
(Yt −

λ) sit

n
X

sjt θj ,

j=1

which is quadratic in the shares. However, since we normalized the θi ’s to have a null unP
conditional value, nj=1 sj θj = 0, we can approximate the process for qti with the one for a
stochastic variable qbti defined as
db
qti

=

dqti

− (Yt −

λ) sit

n
X

sjt θj dt.

j=1

For Model A and B the approximation is exact, as in the former case Yt = λ = 1 and in the
23

Clearly, if we use cross sectional price information to estimate si , the fitted price consumption series would

be centered around the realized one, and this logically improves the appearance of the plots in Figures 8 and 9.
In order to save in space we omit these plots.

31

latter case θi = 0 for all i = 1, ..., n. For the general case, it turns out that
n
X
(Yt − λ) sit
sjt θj dt
j=1

is extremely small, leading to an approximation error of less than 0.1% in prices. Indeed, one
P
can expect the approximation error to be relatively small so long the variance of nj=1 sjt θj
is small. We conjecture that this is always the case when n is sufficiently large. Certainly
the volatility of this quantity in our data set, with 20 industry portfolios, is puny and has no
pricing impact.
VII.D Comparison with Campbell and Cochrane (1999)
Our model differs from that of Campbell and Cochrane (1999) in modeling Yt rather
than the surplus consumption ratio. A simple application of Ito’s Lemma though allows us to
compute the differential equation governing the law of motion of st = log (St ) = − log (Yt ):

where
b (st ) = α (1 − λest ) σc,1 .

Expression (34) should be compared with equation (3) in Campbell and Cochrane (1999).
Besides the Ito term in the drift rate, the model is qualitatively very similar to Campbell and
Cochrane (1999): st follows a mean reverting process with a decreasing volatility in st , as
b (st ). Differences arise simply to the different functional forms of the
regulated by a function λ
drift and volatility.
Campbell and Cochrane (1999) choose the functional form of the sensitivity function,
the sensitivity of st with respect to shocks to consumption growth, to guarantee that the
risk free rate remains constant. It is useful then to compare our set up to that of Campbell
and Cochrane (1999) in light of equation (25). As it is well known, a drawback of habit
persistence models is that the dependence of the risk free rate on St may result in rates that
are too volatile when compared with data. It is for this reason that Campbell and Cochrane
(1999) judiciously choose functional forms for the dynamics of the surplus consumption ratio
that guarantee stable interest rates. Equation (25) shows the parametric restrictions that are
needed in order to yield a constant risk free rate:
α=

k
,
λσc σc0 S
32

(35)

which is, essentially, the modeling choice made by Campbell and Cochrane (1999). We have
not imposed condition (35).24 There were two reasons to do this. First, we wanted our model
to deliver implications for both the risk free rate and the stock market to provide as complete a
picture as possible of financial markets. The second reason is linked to the lower risk-aversion
coefficient that we assume compared to Campbell and Cochrane (1999). If we were to impose
(35), stabilizing the interest rate would result in a very highly volatile habit level, which is
difficult to reconcile with its intuition of being a smoothed average of past consumption levels.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
If one is interested in prices modeling cash flows is unavoidable. In this paper we advance
a model of cash flows that we combine with a stochastic discount factor to solve for prices within
a general equilibrium consumption based asset pricing model. Prices in our model are given
by a term that is linear in what dividends should be, given the current consumption level, a
stochastic trend, and a second term that is the deviation of the current level of dividends with
respect to their stochastic trend. The coefficient in each of these two terms depend on the
variable that summarizes the aggregate state of the economy, the surplus consumption ratio.
This representation sheds light on several issues.
Shocks to cash flows have very different effects on prices depending on where they occur
over the business cycle. In particular, when cash flow betas are identical across assets, cash flow
shocks have a large impact on prices during business cycle peaks and a smaller effect in troughs.
Conversely, the business cycle drives the cross section of price dividend ratios in predictable
ways. Once again, if assets have identical cash flow betas, the dispersion of individual price
dividend ratios increases over business cycle peaks. This result survives when we allow for a
general covariance structure between dividend growth across different assets and consumption
growth, as model simulations show. This matches the empirical regularity uncovered in this
paper, namely, that the cross sectional standard deviation of price dividend ratio tracks the
level of the price dividend ratio of the market portfolio.
24

Neither do Campbell and Cochrane (1999) in the working paper version of their paper. See also their

discussion in pages 214-216 of the published version. Notice also that the source of variation in the risk free
rate is different from the one recently explored by Wachter (2001), where the real rate changes due to changes
in the drift rate of consumption. In our paper, as in Campbell and Cochrane (1999), consumption growth is an
i.i.d. process.

33

The model matched the cross sectional dispersion in the variance decomposition across
industries as well as the observed history of prices across our set of industry portfolios. In particular, the model links secular trends in prices to the lower share that these assets contribute
to overall consumption but shows that business cycle considerations need to be included in
order to fully account for the history of price levels.25
There is an important aspect of the ideas advanced in this paper that we intend to tackle
in future research. Our set up is one that allows for a full specification of the conditional
moments of financial variables, whether price dividend ratios or returns, and, consequently,
we can identify and study these conditional moments through the lenses of the model. To
motivate this exercise, it is useful to return to Figure 2. In addition to the level of prices, the
main motivation to include it early in the paper, the plot shows a rather intriguing difference
between Paper and Railroads. The time series of these two industries are almost the mirror
image of each other. Railroads tracks the price consumption ratio of the market portfolio
until 1960 when they uncouple and move in opposite direction. Up to 1960 then Railroads
seems driven mostly by a common aggregate factor whereas afterwards it comoves less with
the market, to the point where it does not even react significantly to the correction in the mid
1970s. Paper is exactly the opposite. It seems to be largely disconnected of the aggregate price
consumption ratio in the early part of the sample and it is only after 1960 that it shows the
same business cycle patterns that characterize the market, though Paper did not experience
the sudden and extraordinary rise of aggregate prices in the second half of the 90s. Indeed,
the variance decomposition looks rather different across industries when the sample is split
evenly. In the 1927-1962 sample, the variance of the price dividend ratio for Railroads is only
driven by shocks to expected returns whereas in the 1963-2001 sample is the exact opposite.
For Paper shocks to expected returns is a much large component of the variance of the price
dividend ratio throughout.
It seems then that the weight of each component on the variance of the price dividend
ratio is changing over time. We believe that, in general, looking at these and other conditional
moments can give additional insights into asset prices and, perhaps more importantly, into the
elusive connection between finance and macroeconomics.
25

Clearly, though our model is supposed to explain prices at any frequency, it cannot reproduce the behavior of

prices at very high frequencies, and ingredients others than the ones brought to bear here need to be introduced
to account for them.

The last equation matches the Sharpe ratio, computed in the data as the ratio of mean stock returns over its

standard deviation. Although the model has a closed form expression for the Sharpe ratio (see equation (28)),
matching its unconditional average to its sample counterpart would not take into account a Jensens’ inequality
term. The appropriate procedure is to compute the model-implied ratio of the unconditional mean return to
the unconditional mean volatility, and match that to its sample counterpart.

for some function σ i (st ). Defining et+∆ = st+∆ − sk − (1 − k) st , we impose the moment
conditions
E [et+∆ ] = 0 and E [et+∆

st ] = 0

Since the model effectively predicts a stochastic volatility for the errors et+∆ , we estimate the
parameters by efficient GMM with Newey-West spectral density matrix
ST = Γ0 +

(1 − (v/ (q + 1))) Γv + Γ0v



v=1

where Γv = E [ut ut−v ] is the v-lag autocovariance matrix of (de-meaned) errors ut . The
number of lags q was chosen to equal four (quarters).
Next, we turn to estimate the vectors vi ’s. Notice that the diffusion part of the process
P
i
log(sit ) is given by σlog
= vi − nj=1 sjt vj . We rely on an approximation of this volatility
function. Monte Carlo simulations show that the methodology is accurate. If we assume
P
i
that the nj=1 sjt vj component of σlog
does not move by a good deal over the sample period,
P
then we can assume it constant and approximately equal to nj=1 sj vj . Hence the diffusion
P
i
process of the log-share would be σlog
≈ vi − nj=1 vj sj . In addition, because shares sum
up to one, without loss of generality we can assume vn = 0. Hence, define the vector yt =

(C) Derivation of the pricing formulas.
In this appendix we only provide the explicit steps about the approximate formula (20).
Special cases, and exact, of the following derivation are the pricing functions in Proposition 1
- 3, which can be derived directly following the steps in the text.
Define for convenience vY = −ασc so that the Habit process can be rewritten as

dYt = k Y − Yt dt + (Yt − λ) vY dBt

(37)

Given the form of the utility function, as before, we obtain immediately the price of the
stock:
